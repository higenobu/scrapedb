2/11/2022,"Machines might seem an antithetical thing to get sentimental about, but in Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s view of them as imperfect, quirk-prone and funny, they’re pretty much human. The film-maker cobbles together off-kilter worlds where everything is mechanized yet nothing works properly, daily life turned into an absurd burlesque of glitches, miscommunications, system errors and sound-the-alarm snafus. In early-career triumphs like Delicatessen or The City of Lost Children, Jeunet assembled Rube Goldberg contraptions with such fastidious personal care that they couldn’t help but be imbued with the idiosyncrasies of their creator. Sometimes, he’ll apply this notion in a more figurative way to satirize the catch-22-clogged French bureaucracy, a giant engine seemingly built to malfunction. He gets in one or two such cracks with his latest film Bigbug, in which fees incur fees that incur fees. Mostly, however, he’s concerned about actual robots.  Technology takes the explicit focus of Jeunet’s literally screw-loose new comedy, now landing on Netflix (with a dearth of fanfare, surprising for the director behind one of the highest-grossing foreign-language releases in the history of American moviegoing). The streaming platform is an ironic place for a film so wary of the “internet of things” to end up, though it’s caught between the digital and analog on a few concurrent levels. The action has been confined to a home full of hinky practical-effect androids, wedged in a prefab neighborhood of little-box CGI conformity. A revolution among next-gen automatons raging outside traps a collection of homo sapiens there, mismatched caricatures befitting the broad sex farce inexplicably jammed in the middle of this commentary on AI run amok. Between klutzy ploys to get into each other’s pants, the organic life forms collude with the cruder household bots they have come to consider family to beat back the real menace: the charmless homogeneity of smart-tech. Something’s not right with the ubiquitous off-brand Robocops cheekily dubbed Yonyx (François Levantal), their forehead QR-code tattoos and oversized fake teeth unsettling even before they rise up in a coup d’etat. They are polished to the point of untrustworthiness; fittingly, one of their kind gains traction as a fringe politician. This dash of background color plays on a television in the home of Alice (Elsa Zylberstein), which is kept in order by a short circuit-looking vacuum, a talking bust of Albert Einstein that walks on animatronic spider legs and the bob-haired electro-maid Monique (Claude Perron). They’re three of the good ones, friendly and helpful when not on the fritz, somewhere between nanny and pet for Alice and daughter Nina (Marysole Fertard). Most importantly, they’re cool with servitude, garbling any class-based allegories in favor of a loftier ontological journey to learn what it means to be human. Their joint quest to become a real boy/girl/vacuum often plays like the B-plot to the goings-on with Alice’s many guests. We’ve got a sleazy suitor (Stephane de Groodt) and his surly teen son (Hélie Thonnat), her loutish ex-husband (Youssef Hajdi) and his trophy girlfriend (Claire Chust), her aging neighbor (Isabelle Nanty) and the obsolete hunk (Alban Lenoir) she’s programmed to love her. Locked indoors until the threat level beyond their impregnable walls sinks to an acceptable number, they moon over one another with serviceable bawdy humor that only briefly veers into that distinctly Gallic brand of shrillness. A running gag involving the Kama Sutra provides a helpful reminder that the national perception of the French as highbrow sophisticates does not account for their studio comedies. Thinking beyond the containment of his chamber-piece setup, Jeunet indulges in some universe-building that takes his signature combination of the morbid and silly to a brighter, peppier register. In the teal retro-futurist kitchen, Monique shakes nutritious crickets out of a box like cereal, and on the TV, the show “Homo Ridiculus” subjects humans to humiliating scenarios for the amusement of the Yonyx. Outside the window, roving drones blare advertisements personalized to the rapidly deteriorating state of society. The tone stays light even as the incoming tide of robo-fascism worsens to book-burning, but the bleak details of dystopia are always rapping at the door. Whether it’s the scenery or the cybernetic characters, Jeunet takes far more interest in things than the people he leaves as thin archetypal sketches. Lest this be mistaken for coldness, he locates the film’s soul in those searching for one, the quirkier robots treated with more affection than their mass-produced counterparts goose-stepping out of Silicon Valley. With his work now migrating online and his jerry-rigged methods increasingly outsourced to post-production effects, Jeunet can’t avoid the impending digitization of cinema, nor life. Still, he’s not going down without landing a few good fingers to the ribs first.

2/11/2022,"Ray has become a bit intolerant since I’ve gone vegetarian  Ray is generally a good person to live with, but since I’ve gone vegetarian I think he’s become a bit intolerant. I was never a big meat-eater before I met my girlfriend; I was always trying to up my protein intake with unhealthy shakes and supplements. My girlfriend, who is vegan, taught me that I don’t need all that. Ray could take a leaf out of my book, as cutting animal products out of my diet has made me feel amazing. Surely he should want that, too. Since then, I’ve bought new kitchenware as I don’t want Ray’s cooking to contaminate our food. I have asked him a few times to stop using my pots and pans but he still does it – I think he gets a slight kick out of seeing me panic. Once, when I smelled pork on my pan, I told him he was selfish and that I don’t want meat in my veggie meals. He did apologise and said he got them mixed up, but he also told me to calm down in a silly voice, as if it were a joke. He needs to be more considerate. Ray points out that while I have become a vegetarian, I still smoke. He thinks it means I’m a hypocrite, but that’s a false equivalence. It’s a way to silence me when I start telling him about the problems with eating meat. I believe it’s a good idea to be more conscientious with regard to the impact we are leaving on the planet. My girlfriend doesn’t come around that much, but when she does we try to cook at different times to Ray so we don’t have to smell or touch meat. She doesn’t want to use utensils covered in animal products either. We’ve tried to devise a schedule, and I always tell Ray in advance when she’s coming, but he gets sulky and complains. He says, “I can’t live how I want to in my own home,” but that’s not true. Ray needs to adapt to my lifestyle changes as I would do the same for him. He needs to realise we aren’t the same selfish twentysomethings we were when we met. I want to be healthier, live longer, and reduce my carbon footprint. If Ray did the same, it would benefit him and everyone else, too. Paolo once told me I was killing myself because I’d made a tuna sandwich I moved into this flat with Paolo a couple of years ago. Paolo was a big meat-eater, which worked, as I am too. We ordered pepperoni pizzas for our hangovers and occasionally cooked the odd fry-up or curry in the week. But Paolo recently went vegetarian and now he wants to control how I cook meat in our kitchen, which is not fair. It all started when he began dating his new girlfriend. She sends him Netflix documentaries about vegan athletes and the ills of the meat and fish industries. After their first month of dating, Paolo was converted. He threw out all the bacon and burgers in our house, including some of mine. Paolo bought himself a separate fridge and lectures me on the dangers of eating animal products. Once he told me I was “killing myself” when I made a tuna sandwich. That was a bit intense. I care about my health, but I’m not going to change my diet based on his views. He’s too forceful with his opinions. Paolo tries to get me to eat chickpea burgers, salad and stuffed peppers as it’s “better” for my health. His girlfriend visits often and they cook vegan meals together. It means I can’t be in the kitchen at the same time as them. They say the smell and sight of meat makes them sick. I do compromise by letting them cook alone, but it’s annoying having to sneak a Nando’s up to my room. When Paolo first went vegetarian, cooking in our flat was fine; we just did everything separately. Then he bought new pans as he didn’t want the “meat juice” contaminating his food. One time he said I was poisoning him. However, he still smokes. Paolo needs to relax and mind his own business if he wants me to stay in this house. He can’t expect me to change my lifestyle overnight to suit him. We don’t socialise together as much now, because he’s always with his girlfriend and prefers vegan beer and bland meals to the stuff we used to like. Paolo could also stop banning me from the shared spaces when we both need to cook, and remember that he once loved a good steak. Should Paolo back off and let Ray cook meat in their shared space? My housemate of seven years turned vegan a few years ago. I remain a meat eater. However, we respect each other – she has specific pans, and I air out the kitchen if I’m cooking something smelly. Paolo is within his rights to want separate cooking equipment, but he needs to understand that he doesn’t have the right to lecture Ray on his lifestyle.Ben, 37 Paolo has good reasons for becoming vegetarian, but it’s not up to him to lecture Ray on changing his lifestyle – it’s his choice. Ray shouldn’t use Paolo’s pots but they need to compromise and share cooking space and time equally.Sally, 69 Paolo is being unreasonable: he’s made a major (and positive) change but the houseshare started on the basis that neither minded what the other cooked. He should win Ray over by upping his vegan cooking game.Sara, 46 Do I detect a hint of jealousy about the new girlfriend in Ray? The previous status quo was clearly a meaty one. But now Ray needs to move in Paolo’s direction, and show sensitivity by respecting the veggie saucepans.Paul, 58 While Paolo’s life choices are admirable, he’s not being fair to Ray and the ethos of communal living. Separate pans are fine but segregated kitchen time is a step too far. Paolo needs to establish a better balance between his new life choices and his housemate.Mark, 34 So now you can be the judge, click on the poll below to tell us: should Ray stop cooking meat in the kitchen?

2/11/2022,"Magnus Carlsen’s vintage performance at Wijk aan Zee gained the world champion three rating points in his quest for a world record 2900. A week later the Norwegian, 31, gave them all back with interest on a Saturday night in Oslo to Tallaksen Ostmoe, rated 399 points lower than the No 1. The very first meeting 22 years earlier between the then nine-year-old Carlsen, rated under 1000, and the 15-year-old Ostmoe, rated over 2200, had also been a draw and a rating upset, but this was the other way round.  In Saturday night’s game Carlsen, White in a Caro-Kann 1 e4 c6, provoked a very early queen exchange, gained a slight edge … then missed a one-move winner. Can you do better? Carlsen’s progress towards 2900 has been handicapped by his lack of 2800-plus opponents, meaning that his rating gain from a victory is small while a draw is guaranteed to lose him rating points. There has also probably been some deflation at top level in the rating system since 2014, when Fide’s March rating list showed 50 players rated 2700 and above, contrasting with only 38 players over 2700 in the current live ratings. It would be bizarre for the world champion to abandon his 2900 target so soon after announcing it as a preferred alternative to meeting anyone from his own generation in a title match, and the indications are that he will look towards the St Louis-organised Grand Chess Tour this spring for his next major tournament, before returning to home territory at Stavanger in June. He also starts next Saturday, 19 February, in the Airthings Masters, the first event of the year in the online Meltwater Champions Tour which Carlsen won in 2021. Yuri Averbakh became the first ever centenarian grandmaster on Tuesday, when the 1954 USSR champion and famous endgame writer celebrated his 100th birthday. Last week’s column marked the veteran’s achievement with an elegant Averbakh puzzle whose brief answer is well worth solving if you missed it. Averbakh has written a dozen books, but the one which stands out for would-be improving players is Chess Endings: Essential Knowledge, around 120 pages and still freely available online for around £10. US grandmasters have dominated their Russian rivals in the group stage of the first leg (of three) of the Fide Grand Prix, which qualifies its top two to the eight-player Candidates at Madrid in June. Hikaru Nakamura and Levon Aronian are through to this weekend’s semi-finals, while Wesley So and Leinier Dominguex meet in a speed tie-break on Friday (2pm start). In contrast, Alexander Grischuk, Andrey Esipenko, Vladimir Fedoseev and Daniil Dubov have all been eliminated. Aronian has been the standout player so far. The former Armenian not only impressively won his group with a round to spare, but is now neck and neck with Fabiano Caruana in the ratings in a race to become established as US No 1. Nakamura sparked controversy when the Fide president, Arkady Dvorkovich, chose him as his personal wildcard when it was expected that he would prefer Esipenko, 19. As it turned out, Esipenko got in anyway via another withdrawal, and when they met Nakamura played what he called a “statement game” as a response to the criticisms of his inclusion. White’s 24 b4-b5! led to some well calculated tactics. Nakamura’s strong performance in Berlin confounded those who called him just an online streamer who did not merit his Grand Prix wildcard. The five-time US champion believes that online is still the same game as over-the-board chess. He said: “It’s nice to win games, and to prove to people that there is really no difference. Just look at who won most of those online tournaments. It was this guy called Magnus, and he seems to be pretty decent at over-the-board chess too!” Thursday’s return Esipenko v Nakamura game was in the final round of the group stage. The Russian needed a win with the white pieces, the American only a draw to top the group. Too much tension? The game proved chaotic and error-strewn as both GMs made numerous mistakes until Nakamura managed to reach a drawn queen ending. China’s world No 3, Ding Liten, who was thought to be out of the current world championship cycle after his journey to Berlin was stopped by visa difficulties, could yet have another opportunity. If Ding reaches the semi-finals or better in the second Grand Prix leg at Belgrade, he would then be eligible to fill a vacancy if one occurred in the third and final leg back in Berlin. One possible scenario would be if the second Chinese player, Yu Yangyi, did badly in Belgrade and then dropped out. The rules appear to say that in case of a withdrawal, Dvorkovich decides who will be the replacement. The politically savvy Dvorkovich will be well aware of the importance of keeping friendly relations between Fide and China, and that in some circumstances Ding might get a chance for a direct match with Carlsen should the world champion refuse to meet Fide’s designated candidate. 3802: 1 Bg2!

2/11/2022,"“It means something brand new, never before seen, hasn’t been put on a map yet,” says Mark Wahlberg to his co-star Tom Holland in a promo clip explaining the title of their new movie, Uncharted. “And that’s what this movie is,” Holland agrees. Well … even without seeing Uncharted, we all know that’s not quite true. For one thing, it is adapted from a popular video game series, but also, let’s admit, in movie terms, this territory is actually pretty well charted. The treasure-hunt movie is now a genre, usually involving a couple of adventurers thrown into a globe-trotting quest for a highly valuable artefact, pursued by dangerous rivals, hostile natives and so on. This terrain has been mapped over the past 40 years by the likes of Indiana Jones, Romancing the Stone, The Mummy, National Treasure, Tomb Raider, the other Tomb Raider. Just last summer we had Disney’s Jungle Cruise – with Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt questing up the Amazon.  Next month we will be getting The Lost City, with Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum questing in Central America. A fifth instalment of Indiana Jones is halfway through shooting. Clearly, this is a formula that works. But it is also a narrative with a legacy. There’s no way round it: these are stories of white people travelling to lands populated by non-white people and stealing their stuff. As anyone who has visited a European or American museum in the past century will know, this is not pure fiction. In real life, however, the direction of travel is now more in the opposite direction. Institutions in Europe and the US have begun returning looted artefacts, such as the Benin Bronzes, which were taken from Nigeria by the British in 1897. Last year, the Belgian government agreed to return some 2,000 “stolen” artefacts to Congo, and Unesco urged the British Museum to return the Parthenon (AKA Elgin) marbles to Greece. Uncharted is primarily unchallenging popcorn fare, but as with so many treasure-hunt movies, its connections to the real history of colonial plunder are barely disguised. The treasure in question here is that of Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, who circumnavigated the globe in the name of the Spanish empire 500 years ago. According to the film, his booty-laden ships are still out there, somewhere in the Philippines. (There is little discussion about where Magellan might have acquired such riches, or who its rightful owners might be.) Holland’s character is Nathan Drake, son of an American archaeologist and self-proclaimed descendent of Francis Drake, England’s own 16th-century imperialist plunderer. His arch-rival in the race to find Magellan’s treasure is a descendant of the Spanish family that originally funded Magellan. So not such a “brand new” story after all. So many of these movies refer to history for their myths and MacGuffins, particularly the British empire. In Jungle Cruise, Emily Blunt is a posh, surprisingly athletic English botanist in the 1910s. Tomb Raider’s Lara Croft is of a similar pedigree: the well-educated daughter of a wealthy, aristocratic British archaeologist. In The Mummy movies, Rachel Weisz plays a bookish (but surprisingly athletic) 1920s Egyptologist named Evelyn Carnahan. She was modelled on Evelyn Beauchamp, daughter of Lord Carnarvon, financier of Howard Carter’s Egypt excavations that discovered Tutankhamun’s tomb. Rather than actual history, though, the real origins of this genre lie in movie history, and in particular, that Magellan of archaeological adventuring, Indiana Jones. As notes from a 1981 brainstorming session between George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Lawrence Kasdan revealed, they were chiefly inspired by the movies they grew up on, such as King Kong, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and the thrilling Republic serials of the 1940s and 50s. Also mentioned are Ripley’s Believe It Or Not, Disneyland rides and pseudoscientific books such as Erich von Daniken’s Chariots of the Gods. “I don’t think they even knew the name of a single real-life historical archaeologist,” says Justin Jacobs, history professor at American University and author of Indiana Jones in History. “It’s all recycling of previous pop culture. There’s zero historical research in there.” Looking at the anachronisms and casual racism of the Indiana Jones movies, this comes as no surprise. In 1984’s Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, for example, the film-makers took the 1930s Indian setting as licence to lay out an all-you-can eat buffet of Orientalist stereotypes. Literally so in the maharajah’s feast scene, where live snakes, eyeball soup, giant beetles and chilled monkey brains are on the menu (none of which have anything to do with Indian cuisine). Further afield, the movie peddles a brown-skinned death cult that rips out people’s hearts, kidnaps white women and enslaves children – until Indy turns up to white-saviour everyone. Consciously or not, these movies mirror Europe’s real-life colonial enterprises. Lucas initially imagined Jones as a kind of “outlaw archeologist”, for example, but quickly realised his hero would need a veneer of academic legitimacy to justify his looting, hence his catchphrase, “That belongs in a museum!” The real-life European looters of the 19th century used similar justifications, says Jacobs: “Basically, it was: ‘We’re going out in the name of science. We’re going to rescue evidence of grand, glorious civilisations that once existed in the distant past. You guys don’t care about this stuff any more. We’re rescuing it, preserving it, we’ll study it, put it on display, and then educate the world.’” The whole exercise was underpinned by essentially racist assumptions. Foreign artefacts were often valued solely in terms of their relevance to European history. Superior non-white craftsmanship was invariably taken as evidence of some hidden European influence. Or even extraterrestrial influence in the case of Von Daniken’s theories about central American civilisations (Indiana Jones part four, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, agreed). The decline of formerly great civilisations was often attributed to racial intermixing diluting some original white, empire-building ancestry. The colonial powers of Europe were often in competition. Italian explorer Giovanni Belzoni, for example, became a national celebrity when he shipped a huge bust of Ramesses II from Egypt to London in 1818, succeeding where Napoleon’s troops had failed (it is still on display in the British Museum). “It wasn’t so much a case of: ‘That belongs in a museum’ as, ‘That belongs inourmuseum.’” says Jacobs. You don’t have to look far to explain how Indiana Jones spawned a whole genre. Raiders of the Lost Ark was the highest-grossing movie worldwide in 1981. Its three sequels were equally huge. Joining Temple of Doom in the box office top 10 in 1984 was another treasure-hunt smash: Romancing the Stone, which at least charted some new territory, in that neither Kathleen Turner nor Michael Douglas were posh, British, or even interested in archaeology. Still, they had a map and were on the hunt for a fabled emerald. When they eventually found it, did they donate it to a responsible Colombian cultural institution? Of course not. Douglas sold it and bought a yacht. As well as replicating Indiana Jones’s profitability and casual stereotyping, Romancing the Stone and its sequel, The Jewel of the Nile, cemented another trope of the treasure-hunt genre: white women find these kinds of adventures rather liberating and transformative. Turner’s literary urbanite is initially squeamish at Colombia’s people, animals, weather etc. Then Douglas chops off her high heels with a machete and she’s free! Many others have followed in her flat-heeled footsteps. By the looks of it, that includes Sandra Bullock in The Lost City: she plays another lonely writer “thrust into an epic jungle adventure” – along with Channing Tatum’s equally useless male model. There have been a few attempts to take this kind of explorer material seriously. Werner Herzog’s Fitzcarraldo and Aguirre, the Wrath Of God, say. Or, more recently, James Gray’s The Lost City of Z, based on real-life British explorer Percy Fawcett, who spent nearly 20 years searching for a mythical Amazonian city (coincidentally co-starring Tom Holland). Ciro Guerra’s Embrace of The Serpent offered a more bracing counter-narrative, viewing two different white men’s Amazon expeditions through the eyes of their indigenous guide. Also noteworthy is the scene in Marvel’s Black Panther where Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger forcibly repossesses an African artefact from a British museum. “How do you think your ancestors got these?” he asks. Is it possible to retool these creaky narratives for our more culturally enlightened age? Possibly. Disney’s Jungle Cruise managed partially to disguise its own problematic origins. The original Disneyland ride took passengers on a mock British colonial vessel through a mash-up of “exotic” Asian, African and South American landscapes, complete with racist caricatures such as “Trader Sam”, a grass-skirted animatronic cannibal holding up a shrunken head. Sam was quietly removed from the ride in preparation for the movie. In Jungle Cruise, the sought-after treasure is not an indigenous artefact but a medicinal tree at the heart of the Amazon, first sought by Spanish conquistadors. Blunt’s liberated heroine (she even wears trousers) seeks the tree in order to help treat first world war soldiers. Rather than faceless enemies, the indigenous jungle-dwellers are treated respectfully (Trader Sam is a woman, and not a cannibal), and the villains of the piece are the ghosts of the Spanish conquistadors, in league with the Germans. Uncharted navigates its own clumsy course through these waters, bizarrely involving two women of colour (and no Filipinos), although its treasure-hunters do not even pretend to have philanthropic or intellectual motivations; they just want the loot. Let’s see how The Lost City and the fifth Indiana Jones fare. The Lost City’s trailer features no discernible locals. Indiana Jones’s story reportedly involves Nazis and the space race, which suggests it also dodges issues of foreign engagement. Almost certainly this will be the last of the series – Harrison Ford turns 80 this year – if not the end of the treasure-hunt movie era, although perhaps it’s time. There’s a moment in The Last Crusade when Indy tells the panama-hatted villain stealing his golden artefact: “That belongs in a museum!” The villain replies: “So do you.”  Uncharted is released in the UK on 18 February.",Arts/Film,Booty calls: Hollywood’s problem with lost-treasure yarns,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/11/booty-calls-hollywoods-problem-with-lost-treasure-yarns
2/11/2022,"The third season of Netflix’s abstinence-in-bikinis reality show, Too Hot to Handle, launched on the platform in late January with a surprising twist. At the beginning of the first episode, the show’s narrator, Desiree Burch, explained to viewers that one day after wrapping up the filming of season two last year, an entirely new cast was introduced to the show’s villa in the Turks and Caicos Islands. As with the second season’s brigade of contestants, season three’s group were not informed that they would be appearing on Too Hot to Handle, whose agonising reputation precedes it. Instead, the programme-makers told their band of singles that this was a sexy show called Pleasure Island, complete with a fake host and its own in-show lingo. The participants in Too Hot to Handle’s third season had no idea this trick had also been used on their predecessors. They seemed dejected, if still slightly knowing, when they were told. But it’s not surprising that the show’s producers were keen to pull the rug out from under them in pursuit of “authenticity”. Reality TV is now self-consciously commercial, with contestants increasingly seeing its shows as a fast track to brand partnerships and sponsorship deals in a TV-to-Instagram-influencer pipeline. Contestants take part with the intention of growing their social media followings and signing lucrative promotional deals when they leave. Over the years, even the format and production values of reality TV have become predictably staged: we get scene transitions with establishing shots, musical interludes and stock character tropes that become even more pronounced during the edit.  Many reality TV fans are old enough to remember that things were not always this way. Recently, I’ve noticed internet users sharing grainy, boisterous clips from the UK’s original reality juggernaut, Big Brother (during lockdown, three “superfans” even launched a podcast devoted to analysing each episode). Despite the scandal this show courted during its 18-year run and the fact its early contestants were forced to contend with a savage, pre-Leveson tabloid culture, clips from the series now seem like a raw counterpoint to current reality TV. The first series, which launched on Channel 4 in 2000, was billed as a “social experiment”. Contestants included a bricklayer from Liverpool and an Irish ex-nun. To begin with, there was no expectation that contestants would do anything but come as they were, to a house where their every action would be filmed for two months. People arrived from all walks of life, and top-percentile hotness was not necessarily a prerequisite for selection. Of course, Big Brother was not without controversies: it was accused of shamefully showcasing public prejudice, exploiting vulnerable contestants and stigmatising welfare issues. In 2020, season six contestant Makosi Musambasi told Grazia magazine that she believed she had been treated differently to other contestants by the audience because of her skin colour. And the press reaction to the show was cruel: the late Jade Goody, during her appearance on Big Brother season three in 2002, was branded a “pig” on the pages of the Sun. While Big Brother exposed often ugly truths about the UK, it is the show’s bizarre but simple format and often dishevelled contestants that are remembered with a peculiar fondness by millennials like me. Big Brother and its long-running celebrity iteration were remarkably unpolished. Many shows, such as Strictly and The Masked Singer now consist of heavily formatted celebrity competitions that couldn’t be further from the deeply real magic of a Welsh teenager making up a song about “cooking an egg for the very first time” to a rapt audience of millions. It was six years, last month, since one of the greatest British TV moments in recent history: when Celebrity Big Brother season 17 contestant Tiffany “New York” Pollard mistakenly believed her fellow housemate David Gest was dead. (Gest, in a tragic coincidence, actually died only a couple of months after leaving the Big Brother house.) Even though this happened in 2016 (only a year after Love Island, as we now know it, began), the video footage of the moment – which is poorly lit, and features the housemates looking as unkempt as you’d expect of people who have not left home for over a week – feels worlds away from the glossy, preened appearance of Too Hot to Handle. Reality TV is partly an oxymoron – the nature of editing something into a piece of entertainment has always meant removing at least some of its likeness to real life. It’s important to note that this creation of distance between viewers and contestants can also be a useful corrective to the strong, unfair and deeply personal attacks that many fans, now armed with social media accounts, frequently aim at reality TV recruits. But as the genre has evolved, the “reality” aspect has become more jumbled. Where Big Brother might have been a funhouse mirror held up to daily life, our current formats feel more like a phone camera with Instagram filters. So it’s no surprise that those of us who can recall the first decade of Big Brother are finding enjoyment in revisiting its pure “please do not swear” chaos.

2/11/2022,"Ben Wallace, Britain’s defence secretary, heads to Moscow on Friday riding high: ranked by Conservative members as the best performer in cabinet, his name is being whispered as a possible future secretary general of Nato. It marks a peak for the 51-year-old, who once observed he had “never had an accelerated path through the Tory party” but who has, unlike most members of Boris Johnson’s cabinet, come through crises with his reputation enhanced.  Allies put this down in part to sheer diligence – Wallace admitted last week on a ministerial visit to Croatia that he had only had four days off in the past 18 months – and he gets by on little sleep, frequently at his desk, one said, at 7am or earlier. This time, Wallace has attempted to prepare thoroughly for his meeting with Sergei Shoigu, the first bilateral between UK and Russian defence ministers since 2013, even reaching out across party lines. The minister contacted Lord Robertson, a former Labour defence secretary and Nato secretary general, for advice, because the peer is one of the few British politicians to have met Shoigu (the inscrutable Russian once gave him an ice pick as a present). Insiders praise his ability to make “cold decisions on things like tanks” and argue that, unlike Dominic Raab’s Foreign Office, he had made preparations in case the Taliban took over, by drawing up lists of Afghan interpreters who would be eligible for resettlement ahead of time. But there are flashes of emotion too. Relations with Raab were often difficult, colleagues said, with Wallace complaining about him, sometimes at length, in private during the Afghanistan crisis. Raab had stayed on holiday at first, and the Foreign Office struggled to handle emergency asylum claims – errors that eventually led to his demotion. A long-term supporter of Johnson’s leadership credentials, he was also enraged when Michael Gove capsized the 2016 leadership bid. “Michael seems to have an emotional need to gossip, particularly when drink is taken, as it all too often seemed to be,” Wallace, Johnson’s campaign manager, wrote in the Telegraph at the time. Unlike most politicians, Wallace did not go to university, opting instead for Sandhurst, the officers training academy, before serving in the Scots Guards for seven years until 1998. He reached the rank of captain, and service included two tours of Northern Ireland. At one point, when he was aged 21 or so, he had caught up with members of an IRA active service unit, and found a bag containing “a semtex bomb in a sweetie jar”. Recalling the episode in a BBC podcast interview, Wallace said that the police man standing next to him had shouted “it’s the effing real thing”. The bomb would have gone off if the glass was broken, but he was able to hand it on for safe disposal. Politics came along in 1999, when he served a term as a Conservative in the Scottish parliament, before getting elected to Westminster in 2005, winning the Lancaster and Wyre seat from Labour. Ministerial progress was slow, and after a stint as a PPS to Ken Clarke, he became security minister in 2016. But his military background runs deep. One person who knows him well said he was capable of being “very proud and very critical of the military,” arguing he is perfectly cast in his current job. When Wallace broke down during an LBC interview last August at the height of the Afghanistan crisis, admitting that “some people won’t get back,” he said he felt it so personally “because I’m a soldier”. Others may wonder if he can go further, although Nato, looking for a new secretary general after October, may be a better fit than Downing Sreet ever would be. Even supporters say “he hasn’t been tested on a personal level” in a way prime ministers are routinely in the modern era. “The qualities he has are those that might have got him to the top 50 years ago,” one added.",News/Politics,UK defence secretary heads to Moscow on a ratings high,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/11/uk-defence-secretary-heads-to-moscow-on-a-ratings-high
2/11/2022,"QAnon, the extremist conspiracy movement whose followers believe Donald Trump is waging war against the “deep state”, appears to have instigated a nationwide effort to take control of the US election process in critical battleground states ahead of America’s 2024 presidential election.  In recent months concern has risen over the coordinated efforts of at least 15 candidates – committed to Trump’s “big lie” that the 2020 election was stolen from him – who are now running to serve as chief election officials in key swing states. At least eight of the candidates standing for secretary of state positions have formed an alliance in which they share tactics and tips for success, details of which the Guardian revealed last month. Should any of the candidates be elected, they would be in prime position to distort or even overturn election results in favor of Trump or another preferred presidential candidate in ways that could have a profound impact on or even determine the national outcome. All the big lie candidates vying to gain control of election counts at state level present themselves as Republicans. It is now emerging that QAnon played a critical role in steering far-right candidates towards the secretary of state races as part of what appears to be a calculated nationwide assault on American democracy. “This is the way that QAnon could trigger a constitutional crisis,” said Alex Kaplan, senior researcher at the watchdog Media Matters for America who is a close observer of the conspiracy theory. “QAnon is linked to an effort to recruit and elect candidates to positions directly controlling election administrations, and given their ties to harming democracy, that is very concerning.” QAnon emerged in 2017 when an unknown figure, “Q”, began to post on the 4chan message board that Trump, then in the White House, was secretly preparing to destroy a cabal of Satan-worshipping child traffickers. The conspiracy has become more overtly political in recent months, helping to spread baseless claims that the 2020 election was rigged for Joe Biden. It was also implicated in the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. The FBI has arrested more than 20 QAnon followers for violent acts on that day. Last June the agency released a threat assessment that warned that other adherents of the conspiracy could begin “accepting the legitimacy of violent action”. The links between QAnon and the coordinated push to control election counts was revealed by one of the big lie candidates himself. Jim Marchant, a former Republican lawmaker who is running to become chief election official in Nevada, disclosed the connection at “Patriot Double Down”, a QAnon-linked convention held in Las Vegas in October. Marchant told the convention that the idea that he should run for secretary of state was not his own. It was given to him by a prominent QAnon-influencer who goes by the alias Juan O Savin. The name is a phonetic play on the number 1-0-7. Q is the 17th letter of the alphabet. Marchant told the audience of QAnon advocates that he was approached by Savin the day after the presidential election on 3 November. Savin came to him in a suite he had rented in the Las Vegas Venetian hotel accompanied by “other President Trump allies” and told him that instead of running for Congress, which he was considering, Marchant should stand for the post of top election administrator in Nevada. “I said, ‘Absolutely’,” Marchant said in a recorded video of his speech to the convention. “I knew right then that they had figured out that we need to take back the secretary of state offices around the country. Not only did they ask me to run, they asked me to put together a coalition of other like-minded secretary of state candidates. I got to work, Juan O Savin helped, and we formed a coalition.” In an interview with the Guardian last month, Marchant confirmed that he had set up an alliance of at least eight far-right secretary of state candidates in states that are likely to determine the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. They include Arizona, Georgia and Michigan – states which were critical in the 2020 presidential election and which all now have big lie candidates running for secretary of state posts who have been endorsed by Trump. The Guardian contacted Marchant about the QAnon connection, but he did not respond. Marchant’s disclosure of the formative role played by Juan O Savin in the secretary of state candidates alliance, which was first reported by the Daily Beast and by Kaplan for Media Matters, has in turn been corroborated by Savin himself. Kaplan has monitored several recent instances where the QAnon-influencer has spoken about having backed the alliance. In January he told a QAnon show that “we have a project that we are doing helping candidates across the country that we started here in Nevada that has prospered pretty well, with a number of Trump endorsements”. In May he said in a video conversation that he had recently organized a meeting of about 50 people to look at “how we are going to get to a lawful election this time around and get to the right result. How we are going to coordinate between the different states to get to the right outcome.” In the most recent comment, on Sunday, he talked about “the secretary of state stuff”, boasting that “across the country we are gaining strength rapidly to get back into this game in an effective way. A lot of those offices that they thought they held and weren’t going to matter, we are going to flip those.” QAnon watchers say that Savin has been rising rapidly within the conspiracy theory in recent months. “He used to be a fringe figure, but has become a lot more prominent,” said Al Jones, founder of the Q Origins Project, a group of analysts who track the QAnon movement. Savin made a rare open public appearance at the Patriot Double Down convention. Normally, though, he hides his identity. He is often interviewed by QAnon followers as he is driving, showing only his hands on the steering wheel or his cowboy boots. He brags about having high-up contacts in the US intelligence services, though in fact he is believed to be a private insurance investigator living in the Seattle area. He claims to be friends with the actor Roseanne Barr, and in one of the wilder aspects of his influence, is believed by many QAnon followers to be John F Kennedy Jr. Savin’s recent efforts have been focused on spreading falsehoods about mass fraud in the 2020 election. He has also amplified apocalyptic conspiracy theories including that President Biden’s public appearances are broadcast with the use of a green screen to disguise his disabilities. Travis View, a leading QAnon watcher and host of the QAnon Anonymous podcast, told the Guardian that it would be “ruinous for democracy if people involved with QAnon got into positions of power where they have actual influence in determining the results or legitimacy of elections. QAnon is such an anti-reality way of thinking that it is entirely incompatible with the conventions that sustain democracy.” Several people close to Trump are known to have deep ties with the QAnon movement. Michael Flynn, a former national security adviser to Trump, spoke at a previous QAnon conference in Dallas and is thought to also have pushed a strategy of standing for local election among QAnon followers. Sidney Powell, who advocated for overturning the 2020 election result and who Trump at one point verbally agreed to appoint as special counsel on election fraud, also has ties to QAnon. Before Trump was removed from Twitter, he frequently disseminated comments from QAnon followers.",News/US news,‘We have a project’: QAnon followers eye swing state election official races,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/11/qanon-donald-trump-big-lie-elections-swing-states
2/11/2022,"A union organizing drive among workers at corporate run Starbucks stores, the largest coffeehouse chain in the world, has surged in recent weeks throughout the US, organizers and workers say. The development comes in the wake of union election victories at two of three stores in the Buffalo, New York, area that held union votes with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in December.  It also comes amid allegations that seven Starbucks workers in Memphis were fired in retaliation for union organizing. More than 70 stores in at least 20 US states have now filed for union elections since those wins, representing more than 1,300 workers at Starbucks, which previously had no union representation among its corporate-run locations in the US. “We were inspired by the partners in Buffalo that managed to do something many of us have dreamed of for a long time. It’s something we didn’t think was possible, but they really pushed through and showed the rest of us across the nation that we could use our voices and actually unionize,” said Hannah McCown, a Starbucks barista in Overland, Kansas, whose store has recently filed to hold a union election. McCown said their district manager had held aggressive conversations with workers since the organizing campaign went public and that the store was hiring new employees rather than fix the scheduling issues and short staffing that workers have been experiencing. “We are just looking to have our voices heard at a company that we really put everything into,” added McCown. “We are the backbone of this company and while we do believe this is a great company to work for, we do believe things could be done better.” Maddie Levans, a barista for over four years at one of the first Starbucks stores in Philadelphia to file for a union election, explained the union victories in Buffalo inspired her and her co-workers to start the unionizing campaign with Starbucks Workers United. She said her co-workers had already been discussing issues they were having with Covid regulations, accountability for management that needed attention and the disconnect between baristas and corporate. “It’s so reassuring to see so many stores across the country do this and to be part of that wave as one of the first two stores in Philadelphia, let alone Pennsylvania, was phenomenal,” said Levans. “It’s time for Starbucks to actually treat us like partners. They call us partners, but when we’re concerned about different business practices and different problems with how Starbucks is run, we get shut down.” Workers at Starbucks in Buffalo and around the US have criticized Starbucks for aggressively opposing the unionization efforts at their stores. Alleged actions include reports of union avoidance meetings with workers, texts encouraging workers to vote no to the union, an influx of corporate management at stores holding union elections, allegations of unfair labor practice charges made by workers with the National Labor Relations Board and the Memphis firings. Starbucks has retained at least 30 different attorneys with the union avoidance firm Littler Mendelson to represent the company through NLRB proceedings. “This is a national movement that partners across the US are joining and getting involved in. It’s organic in the way it’s grown and it will continue its trajectory to be massive in the coming weeks,” said Richard A Minter, director of organizing and vice-president of Workers United. Minter criticized Starbucks’ response to the union organizing efforts, as the company has continued to encourage workers to vote against unionizing. “It’s something that Starbucks needs to reconsider and immediately stop the anti-union behavior, stop this anti-union rhetoric, allow these partners to be true partners and allow their voices to be heard,” Minter said, “rather than tell them ‘we hear you’, yet they don’t see them or hear them. So a reckoning is coming.” Cathy Creighton, director of Cornell University Institute Industrial Labor Relations Buffalo Co-Lab, explained vast wealth and racial inequality worsened by the pandemic has driven young workers at Starbucks to unionize. Starbucks reported $4.2bn in net earnings in 2021 and the CEO, Kevin Johnson, received more than $20m in compensation in 2021, up 39% from 2020 and 6% from 2019. “Starbucks employees are front-facing the public and took their life in their hands by going to work and did not see the same largesse come their way,” said Creighton. She said that labor law in the US was outdated and strongly favored employers, as only 6.1% of the private US workforce is unionized, yet a strong majority of the population supports unions. “That is not happenstance. It’s an intentional national labor policy which allows employers to crush worker movements and not agree to first contracts with employees,” said Creighton. “Despite the deck being stacked against them, workers are fed up and are taking matters into their own hands by seeking a voice in their workplace and a seat at the table.” A spokesperson for Starbucks denied all allegations of union busting and retaliation, citing labor shortages around the US have created short staffing at stores in some markets, with new hiring needed at some stores. The spokesperson also argued meetings with partners are to educate workers on the union election process and are within the company’s legal rights. In regards to firings of workers in Memphis, Starbucks disputed allegations of retaliation and characterized the firings as responses to safety and security violations, though workers have argued those violations were selectively enforced and refer to a TV news interview they did in the store after hours about the union drive. The spokesperson deferred comment to two letters written in December 2021 by Johnson before the union election in Buffalo and the executive vice-president of North America, Rossann Williams, after the election. “From the beginning, we’ve been clear in our belief that we do not want a union between us as partners, and that conviction has not changed. However, we have also said that we respect the legal process,” wrote Williams.",News/Business,‘This is a national movement’: union drives surge at US Starbucks stores,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/11/starbucks-union-organizing-drives-across-us
2/11/2022,"Diesel fumes and marijuana smoke filled the air outside of Canadian parliament as a “Freedom Convoy” protest against vaccine mandates headed into a third week. Columns of big-rig trucks, pickups and RVs have blockaded the heart of the Canadian capital since 28 January. Camped out in the vehicles are several hundred protesters – including many children – who have driven thousands of kilometres to be here.  Protesters have also blocked the international Ambassador Bridge between Detroit and Windsor, and two smaller border crossings with the US, prompting growing fears of serious economic impact. Justin Trudeau, the White House and even the US Teamsters union have called for an end to the protest. But those camped out in downtown Ottawa insist they will not leave until their demands are met: an end to Covid lockdowns and vaccine mandates. What began as a protest against vaccine requirements for truck drivers entering Canada has grown into a widening protest movement against all Covid public health measures, with copycat demonstrations in the US, France, Belgium, Australia and New Zealand. On a bone-chilling night this week, protesters gathered around open fires and propane stoves as police officers looked on, seemingly unwilling to enforce an order against bring fuel into the city centre. It was quieter than in the earlier days of the protest when truckers infuriated residents by honking their horns late into the night; on Monday, a court injunction was handed down banning air horns for 10 days after a class action lawsuit by sleepless locals. Instead, a semi driver loudly gunned his engine, launching thick black plumes of exhaust into the night sky. “It was definitely time to take a stand,” says Spencer Bautz, a 24-year-old who drove his truck here from Saskatchewan on day one. Dressed in a black cowboy hat, Bautz described vaccine mandates as “medical segregation” and argued that exclusions for the unvaccinated were an infringement of their freedoms. His views, he said, had been greatly informed by the thinking of psychology professor and culture war provocateur Jordan Peterson. “I’m not going to pretend like I know what goes on in upper management or big government. I’m just a farm kid from Saskatchewan,” said Bautz. “But I know that anytime you talk about silencing people, anytime you talk about taking away people’s freedoms … it’s to be taken seriously.” Such good-versus-evil posturing is apparent in the hundreds of handmade signs that line the fence around parliament – little jabs of resistance against Covid policies that prime minister himself said have “sucked for all Canadians”. Lurking below the surface, though, is the same undercurrent of populism that powered the January 6 Capitol insurrection and the yellow vests movement: a powerful current fed by disinformation, conspiratorial thinking and deepening social divides. “Wake up Canada! You are being lied to. Take the red pill and roll on!” reads a sign attached to the front grille of a parked semi. The concept of the “red pill” – which originated in The Matrix films – has become a token for incels and the far-righters who hold that they are “awake” to the way the world really works. “Populist movements are notoriously distrustful of government,” said Queens University assistant professor Amarnath Amarasingam, who specialises in extremism and social movements. “They don’t trust politicians, they don’t trust the media, they don’t trust academics, they don’t trust scientists because they believe that historically, this ‘elite class’ of society has always harmed those at the bottom, the underdogs,” Amarasingam adds. As men and women dressed in flannel hunker down in the cold with their Tim Hortons coffee cups and Canadian flags draped over their shoulders it is clear that the Freedom Convoy’s movement has crystallised. They are here to wake the rest of Canada up to the tyranny of the Liberal government and its “oppressive” vaccine mandates. “Freedom!” bellows one man wearing the flag as a cape. “Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!” comes the response from others outside of the Parliament building – where earlier in the week Trudeau described the same protests as “unacceptable”. The Freedom Convoy is quickly becoming a defining moment in Trudeau’s leadership. The prime minister has refused to lend legitimacy to this movement by engaging with the protesters’ demands – a decision that led two Liberal party members to break rank. Meanwhile, the failure to take decisive action to break up the protest has exposed Trudeau to criticism from all other party leaders. The discord in parliament has allowed protest organisers to become further emboldened in their demands, with some of them openly call for Trudeau to be forced from office. The opposition Conservative party and People’s Party of Canada have both cheered the protesters on, even encouraging donations to their million-dollar crowdfunding efforts. Similarly US Republicans, including Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, have praised the convoy, with some of the protest’s funding believed to have come from south of the Canadian border. Such support has given fresh momentum to the truckers as they launched additional protests at the Canada-US border, and tightened their grip on the capital. On Thursday, trucks circled the Ottawa airport, clogging traffic. People flooded the local 911 number with fake calls, and some tossed around the idea of parading outside of schools. Elsewhere, some journalists have reported being followed, particularly at secondary staging camps outside of the downtown core. Amarasingam outlined several ways the stand-off could end: in tragedy, in violence or because of potential in-fighting. A negotiation, at this point, seems unlikely. “If this ended in some sort of mass arrest or violence, or some sort of tragedy – someone dies or one of these propane tanks explodes – I think it’s that kind of turning point that will change the conversation,” he said. As the protests stretch on, many local residents have become increasingly fed up with their temporary neighbours. Violent confrontations have broken out as protesters harass and insult people wearing masks. A counter-protest is planned for Saturday. The protesters are deeply aware of the negative coverage they have earned, and now espouse peace and love to an almost aggressive degree. One trucker uses a megaphone to loudly proclaim “I love you” to anyone who walks by. A few blocks away, Gurtek Singh – one of the few people of colour at an overwhelmingly white protest – said he was the only breadwinner in a household of six, but that the financial hit from staying off work was worth it. As he spoke, at least a dozen protestor supporters stopped to thank Singh. He smiled politely and accepted the effusive praise. Snowflakes glistened in his bushy salt-and-pepper beard as he said that he had joined the convoy for the sake of his children, who he had kept home from school because of mandatory mask and vaccine mandates. “No government, no other human being can tell me what’s good for my kids, other than me,” he said.",News/World news,"Maple flags, conspiracy theories and The Matrix: inside the Ottawa truckers’ protest",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/11/canada-ottawa-truckers-protest-covid-vaccine-mandates
2/11/2022,"For the past three months, Ugandan forces have been bombarding Islamist rebels in its border region with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The offensive, in the Rwenzori mountain range that straddles both countries, has forced many Congolese to leave their homes and move to the cities for shelter. Sarah Kasanga* is one. The Allied Democratic Force (ADF) militia stormed Kalingathe, her village north of Beni, in December 2019. People were made to lie on the floor while rebels searched homes for food, pots, money or clothes.  DRC soldiers overlook Virunga national park at a military base on the outskirts of Beni “They said they would take me and my younger sister and brother,” says Kasanga. “My mother started crying. They told her to be quiet and we’d be back after carrying their haul to the base.” But that was a lie. Taking three boys and two girls, the group of 20 ADF fighters spent two months weaving through the forest to their camp. Uganda is now fighting alongside the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s armed forces (FARDC) in efforts to root out the rebels. Attacks in Kampala last year added urgency to plans already under way for joint operations to prop up the chaotic and underfunded Congolese forces. Houses abandoned after ADF attacks north of Beni. A DRC military Land Cruiser in Beni and a helicopter flying over the restive territory Reports suggest between 1,500 and 5,000 Ugandan troops could eventually be involved. There are about 120 rebel groups operating in eastern DRC, but the ADF, with an estimated 1,500 fighters, is a particular threat. Formed by groups opposed to Uganda’s autocratic president, Yoweri Museveni, in the late 1990s, their camps are in dense forest from where they carry out brutal raids on villages, abducting recruits. “When we got to the ADF base we were separated by gender; they forced you to convert to Islam, pray, learn Arabic; women have to completely cover themselves,” says Kasanga. “They would also force people to be violent and kill – if you refused they said they would kill you.” Men pick captured women and girls as wives. A UN report found that the ADF raped abductees to use the stigma to deter escape. “They were finding me a husband just before I escaped,” says Kasanga. With dozens of overlapping armed groups operating in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, accurate figures are hard to come by, but the ADF is believed to have killed at least 2,238 people and abducted 896 people since April 2017, according to Kivu Security Tracker, which monitors violence in the region. People recently displaced by ADF attacks, sheltering around a school near Mbau, just south of Oicha Oicha, like many towns in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, has had an influx of thousands of people displaced by the violence, who are still subject to attacks. A bomb exploded in a market hours before the Guardian arrived. A bag thrown over the device dampened the blast and no one was killed. Désiré Kilongo, Oicha’s community leader, talks to displaced people Désiré Kilongo, a community leader, says that since the joint operation the number of displaced people in Oicha has tripled to 21,300, putting pressure on locals. “You’ll now find two or three extra families staying with friends or relatives in a two-room family home.” In surrounding villages, families sleep in schools overnight. In the day, pupils work with heaps of belongings stacked at the back of classrooms. Meals are cooked in playgrounds and teachers lament the poor hygiene in school toilets. When subsistence farmers have to flee, they are left with nothing, risking their lives to return to their farms to harvest what they can. The Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) says 1,166,200 people have been displaced by armed groups around Oicha. It has built shelters for displaced Mbuti, formerly known as Pygmies, and given money to Bantu communities to rent small houses and start businesses. “The proliferation of armies and armed groups is expected to escalate the conflict, leading to more displacement and hardship for civilians. These communities are already at breaking point, says Caitlin Brady, the charity’s DRC director. Displaced members of the Mbuti community, formerly known as Pygmies, in Kelekele camp near Mbau, north of Beni In Kelekele camp, women have their heads shaved in mourning for their dead children. David Jalamuke, an elderly Mbuti man from Matiba, says the ADF killed all but one of his six children last May. His remaining daughter, standing next to him, lost her five children and husband, murdered in the same attack. Jalamuke hid but saw rebels kill his friend. “They stood on his chest, cut his throat in two places and went with his neck,” he says. Others talk of the ADF cutting people into pieces. Raids often involve women and children made to steal food and belongings. One man described seeing “women killing women and children killing children”. David Jalamuke, who has lost all but one of his six children. Mbuti women with their heads shaved in mourning for their murdered children DRC’s president, Félix Tshisekedi, announced a “state of siege” in Ituri and North Kivu in May 2021. Military authorities replaced civilian counterparts, and security personnel were given extra powers but violence continues. With its huge reserves of minerals vital for smartphones and electric car batteries, DRC should be a wealthy country, but the legacy of colonialism and endemic corruption keeps its people among the poorest in the world. Kasanga escaped from ADF in 2020. “We were sent to look for food near Oicha. The lady I was with decided to escape and told me to come with her.” Terrified of leaving her siblings with the ADF, she also feared returning to the base alone. “I’ve heard they are OK, but I worry about them,” she says, now reunited with her mother. “If the ADF sees me, they will kill me. I live in fear.” DRC’s forces are supported by the 15,000-strong UN peacekeeping mission, Monusco. Although effective in targeting another rebel group, M23, in 2013, Monusco has faced criticism over its record of protecting people from ADF, despite $1bn (£740m) of annual funding. Last August saw anti-Monusco protests across eastern DRC. “The FARDC starts operations, the ADF retaliates against the population and the angry population turns against Monusco for failing to protect them,” says Nelleke van de Walle at the International Crisis Group. A Monusco armoured personnel carrier drives through Beni, with Tanzanian UN soldiers onboard. A convoy of blue-helmeted UN peacekeepers escort construction workers back to their base near Beni The joint FARDC-Ugandan operation presents challenges for Monusco, which only has a mandate to support the Congolese forces, says Cecilia Piazza, head of its Beni office. But, she says, coordination is key for “an understanding of what is going on, particularly … when you have various forces in the same theatre”. Piazza says Monusco is listening to criticisms and deploying “quick reaction forces” that are “mobile and robust in nature” to deal with ADF. But she acknowledges fears that attacks on ADF strongholds are just pushing rebels elsewhere. “We have seen incidents north [and] south of the area where the operation is taking place,” says Piazza. Van de Walle says there are concerns too that the FARDC is benefiting from deals with criminal gangs. “FARDC soldiers are underpaid and sometimes worse equipped than the rebel groups,” she says. The DRC state’s failure to protect communities promotes self-defence militias, known as Mai-Mai. In Beni, Patrick Mwenda*, 20, explains how young “patriots” are lured in. In 2016, a man came to his village with three guns. “He said the ADF is killing civilians and the FARDC won’t protect us as they are working with the ADF. He said to protect our land and our families, the village needed to form its own group, attack FARDC bases and take their weapons,” says Mwenda. People bought military-style outfits from the markets and made bows and arrows. Mwenda says he would sometimes get to carry a gun but mostly used a catapult, raiding FARDC bases to steal uniforms and weapons after drinking alcohol made from sorghum and banana. “The fighting was tough. We launched four attacks and the FARDC would stage counterattacks. We’d drink a small amount of the magic liquid that the leader said would protect us from bullets,” he says. “It felt amazing to be a member of the movement, knowing we were saving our land.” Then a new militia, the Union of Patriots for the Liberation of Congo (UPLC), came to the village, offering to train Mwenda’s group. But they did not leave, and ended up taking control of the village and collaborating with the ADF. Mwenda ran away to Beni. Five-year-old Maskia Mukone Chanele at Beni hospital, in a Red Cross tent for victims of a blast in the town on Christmas Day Last year, on Christmas Eve, the Ugandans captured a major ADF camp known as Kambi Ya Yua. On Christmas Day, an ADF suicide bomber retaliated, targeting a restaurant, killing eight and wounding 20 more. In Beni hospital, victims are still recovering. A five-year-old girl, Maskia Mukone Chanele, is lying in a Red Cross tent with facial injuries and after nearly losing an eye. Her 13-year-old sister was killed. “I was astonished when I heard about my daughter and her children,” says Anto Kahambu Kaghoma, Maskia’s grandmother. “This wouldn’t happen somewhere where there is a serious government.” In the garden of a Beni hotel, Tommy Tambwe, who leads North Kivu’s disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programme, is holding a community meeting. As a former rebel, his appointment to a government role was criticised by many for signalling there was a route to power for criminals. But Tambwe claims that the joint military operation and the community-engagement programmes will soon ensure peace for the region. Tommy Tambwe meets community members to discuss disarming Mai-Mai militias and engaging young people. Alphonse Kambale Mubalya in his office At the meeting, Alphonse Kambale Mubalya, who runs a peacebuilding organisation AMIP, blames DRC’s neighbouring countries for the violence. “It’s not like other insurgencies,” he says. “We have farming communities and we wouldn’t need jobs or to take up arms if there was no insecurity. Rebel fighters from Uganda and Rwanda came here in the 1990s and that was the start of the problem.” President Tshisekedi wants to build ties in the region, but people here are suspicious. Dr Denis Mukwege, a gynaecologist and human rights activist who was awarded the Nobel peace for his work against rape as a weapon of war, tweeted that military cooperation was unacceptable after Uganda’s “25 years of mass crimes and plundering of our resources”. Van de Walle says Ugandan investment in DRC’s roads has raised suggestions of ulterior motives over better transport links. Improved security for oil companies is a priority for Kampala – Total and the Chinese-owned CNOOC have confirmed they will begin work on a controversial multibillion-dollar oil pipeline from western Uganda to Tanzania. Meanwhile, thousands of displaced Congolese remain in limbo. Mwenda regrets his past. “The leaders took advantage of us and lied to us to stop us escaping, saying we needed documents to enter Beni or we’d be killed.” He says many rebels want to be reintegrated into their communities but believes their leaders want government money, and are forcing them to fight to keep up pressure on the authorities.
