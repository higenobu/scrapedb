4/6/2022,"It’s a sunny day on a city street as a green bus pulls up by the kerb. Onboard, a handful of passengers sit stony-faced as you step up to present your pass. But you cannot see your body – only a floating pair of blue hands. It might sound like a bizarre dream, but the scenario is part of a virtual reality (VR) system designed to help people with agoraphobia – those for whom certain environments, situations and interactions can cause intense fear and distress. Scientists say the approach enables participants to build confidence and ease their fears, helping them to undertake tasks in real life that they had previously avoided. The study also found those with more severe psychological problems benefited the most. “It leads to a real step-change in people’s lives,” said Prof Daniel Freeman, the lead researcher in the work, from the psychiatry department at the University of Oxford. The VR experience begins in a virtual therapist’s office before moving to scenarios such as opening the front door or being in a doctor’s surgery, each with varying levels of difficulty. Participants are asked to complete certain tasks, such as asking for a cup of coffee, and are encouraged to make eye contact or move closer to other characters. Freeman said while the scenarios feel real, the computer-generated scenes allow participants to feel able to try something new or approach the situation differently. “There’s a little bit of the conscious bit [of the brain] going: ‘OK, it’s OK, I know it’s not real and therefore I can persist, try something new and do something differently,’” he said. “That enables people to apply it in the real world. Basically, if you get over something in VR, you will get over in the real world.” One participant revealed that before using the VR system he struggled with taking a bus to visit his father’s grave. “It was heartbreaking,” he said. However, after using VR system he gained confidence. “It’s helped me for every aspect,” he said. “I’ve been able to get the bus to my dad’s grave, I’ve been able to put flowers down, spend a little bit of time there and get the bus back.” Writing in the Lancet Psychiatry journal, Freeman and colleagues report how they randomly allocated 174 patients with difficulties going outside and psychosis to use the “gameChange” VR technology alongside their usual care. Another 172 patients were allocated to receive their usual care alone. Participants in the VR group were given the opportunity to use the technology for approximately six sessions, each lasting 30 minutes, over the course of six weeks – although not all took part or completed all the sessions. A mental health worker was in the room while each participant used the VR headset, whether in their home or in an NHS clinic, and worked with the participant to apply the learning, including by setting homework tasks between sessions. The results show that six weeks after the trial began, those allocated to the VR therapy had a small but significant reduction in avoiding real-life situations because of agoraphobia, as well as less distress, compared with those who had only received their usual care. However, by six months there was no difference between the two groups. But further analysis revealed that those who had severe agoraphobia benefited most, and for these people the effect was sustained at six months. Such patients were able to complete, on average, two more activities than before – such as going shopping or getting on a bus. While the study cannot tease out the impact of the VR therapy from the mental health worker and their homework, Freeman said other tests had not shown changes in agoraphobia in this population from such homework tasks alone. Freeman added that with VR headsets now costing about £300, it was becoming easier to send such devices to patients’ homes. For the patient who wanted to be able to visit his father’s grave, the benefits have been much more wide-ranging than just completing tasks. “I’ve been able to go out, interact with a lot more people than what I ever expected,” he said. “I’m more confident in myself. I’m more confident around other people.”",News/Technology,"VR role-play therapy helps people with agoraphobia, finds study ",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/05/vr-role-play-therapy-helps-people-with-agoraphobia-finds-study
4/6/2022,"Twitter has announced it is appointing Elon Musk to its board the day after the world’s richest person was revealed to be the social media platform’s biggest shareholder with a 9.2% stake. Parag Agrawal, the Twitter chief executive, said on Tuesday that he was “excited” to announce that Musk was joining the company’s board of directors. “Through conversations with Elon in recent weeks, it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our board,” he said in a tweet. Agrawal said Musk was both a “passionate believer and intense critic” of the service and that was “exactly what we need on @Twitter, and in the boardroom, to make us stronger in the long term”. I’m excited to share that we’re appointing @elonmusk to our board! Through conversations with Elon in recent weeks, it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our Board. Musk, who has more than 80 million followers on Twitter, said he was “looking forward to working” with the board “to make significant improvements to Twitter in coming months”. Looking forward to working with Parag & Twitter board to make significant improvements to Twitter in coming months! Twitter said on Tuesday it has been working on an edit button since last year and will test the feature with select Twitter Blue members in coming months. The company said in a tweet that it did not get the idea for the button from a poll that Musk started, asking users of the social networking platform if they wanted the feature. In a regulatory filing on Tuesday Twitter said it had entered into an agreement with Musk to “serve as a class two director with a term expiring at the company’s 2024 annual meeting of stockholders”. On Monday it emerged that Musk had taken an almost $3bn (£2.3bn) stake in Twitter, a holding more than four times the 2.25% of the site’s co-founder, Jack Dorsey. The company said Musk, either alone or as a member of a group, would not be allowed to own more than 14.9% of Twitter’s outstanding stock for as long as he was a board member and for 90 days after. The boss of Tesla and SpaceX, who with 80.4 million followers ranks in the global Top 10 of the most popular users on the microblogging site, paid $2.89bn for the stake at Twitter’s closing share price on Friday. The company’s shares soared by 27% on Monday after the news, adding about $8bn to its market value. In pre-market trading on Tuesday the shares were up 7% to just under $50, valuing the company at about $40bn. Musk, whose personal fortune is estimated at $289bn – almost $100bn more than the world’s next richest person, the Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos – has often been in trouble for tweeting contentious remarks. The Tesla boss’s many questionable Twitter moments include calling Vernon Unsworth, a diver who helped rescue a team of young football players stuck in a flooded cave in Thailand, “pedo guy” after he criticised Musk’s plan to save them with a submarine. Musk eventually deleted the tweets and apologised to Unsworth, who sued for $190m in damages for the tweets. The jury found the Tesla boss did not defame Unsworth, and after the verdict Musk told reporters in the hallway of the courtroom: “My faith in humanity is restored.” Musk has also found himself in trouble with the US financial markets regulator, the SEC, for posting tweets that had significant ramifications for the companies he runs. In 2018, he posted that he had “secured” funding to take Tesla private, a move that resulted in the SEC requiring Musk to get pre-approval for certain public communications relating to the electric car company’s share price. Musk settled with the SEC, paying a $20m fine and stepping down as Tesla’s chair, while saying it was “harassment” and an “unjustified action”. While he was under investigation by the SEC he smoked marijuana on a live web show, which resulted in a 6% fall in Tesla’s share price and the departure of two of its senior executives.",News/Technology,Elon Musk to join Twitter board after taking $2.9bn stake,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/05/elon-musk-join-twitter-board-stake-tesla-spacex
4/6/2022,"Manchester City were not the smooth operators they so often are but this slender victory may prove invaluable when the tie is decided in next week’s return at Wanda Metropolitano. For this they can thank Phil Foden and his schemer’s eye, the youngster threading the decisive pass that released Kevin De Bruyne who, on his 50th Champions League appearance for City, made no mistake for a winner that was his 11th goal in the competition for the club. It means Pep Guardiola’s side travel to Spain content yet wary as Atlético Madrid are the definition of a streetwise outfit who know when to punish, though João Félix, Antoine Griezmann and Marcos Llorente should all rue missed opportunities tonight. Towards the end the niggly Atlético of repute was on display as Ángel Correa smacked the ball into the face of a supine Jack Grealish, causing Guardiola to shove the Atlético No 10 though the Catalan escaped censure. Sime Vrsaljko was booked for felling Grealish and there will be more antics from Diego Simeone’s side when they search to overturn the deficit in eight days’ time. Here, Guardiola just about got his selection correct – though only after Foden was introduced 80 seconds before creating De Bruyne’s winner. The manager had joked about “over-thinking” in a pre-game discourse delivered with a twinkle that came punctuated with a point he believes pertinent: that he is duty-bound to tinker tactics and personnel – the prevailing criticism aimed at him – when the competition reaches this stage due to the differing nature of the opponent. So it was that Guardiola’s selection was eagerly awaited. Through this prism the discarding of Foden – who had started five of City’s Champions League eight matches – caught the eye. Simeone, who rated the task tougher than knocking out Manchester United in the previous round, could be pleased at his team firing a first salvo. Félix twirled near halfway and flipped a pass behind Nathan Aké for Llorente to run at. João Cancelo had been instructed to drift inside and it was in this zone he drew a foul from Geoffrey Kondogbia. Moments later the Portuguese let go a 25-yard shot that was blocked and had Atlético scrambling in the area before Felipe cleared.

This was underlined when, after ceding the ball, a Cancelo cross for Ilkay Gündogan, then a De Bruyne effort, threatened Jan Oblak’s goal. City had entered onslaught mode, Atlético were hanging on. When Raheem Sterling was felled after a muscular run and Bernardo Silva, collecting the ball, suffered the same – inside the area up against Koke – the Portuguese bemoaned Istvan Kovacs waving away his penalty appeal. Guardiola and Simeone – in near-identical coats – were each unhappy: City’s No 1 perhaps for some unfathomable geometric miscalculation; his counterpart for the needless sloppiness on the ball, Llorente the latest culprit in an error that allowed De Bruyne to whip it in, Gündogan again going close. Atlético are the kings of the counter so Guardiola was furious when Félix could break along the left before a flood of blue shirts engulfed him. A delightful Koke backflick that released Félix was another warning from the Spanish champions. A thrust and verve had entered the contest. Feints, touches, the finding of vital inches: all were executed in slick, computer-game fashion. It was the contest that was expected: City’s domination versus Atlético’s savvy, the home team enjoying 75.6% possession. The closing phase of the half was performed in a crackling atmosphere. The sight of Rodrigo hitting the ball into a red-and-white striped shirt at 30 yards was a compliment to the job thus far done by Simeone’s men. And, too, when John Stones slapped a pass straight out. After De Bruyne went down in the area with Felipe in close attendance the spot-kick was, again, refused by the referee. So, at the break it was level and nicely poised. Gündogan’s deflected shot suggested the pattern of City posing more questions would continue. Griezmann’s break from the resulting corner, and 50-yard run until he sprayed the ball wildly away, fitted the template too. Simeone drills his charges to pounce when the moment arrives. Yet they failed with another break when Llorente raced behind but hit Ederson not Félix. City went from ragged to De Bruyne sending Oblak skimming along the turf to his left to save a free-kick as Atlético’s wall – Félix the main perpetrator – parted badly. Next, Sterling rolled a cross-shot over from the left but Silva, the false 9, nor any other teammate could stab home. Griezmann’s last act was to be fouled by Silva as Simeone made a triple substitution – Koke and Llorente also departing as Correa, Rodrigo de Paul and Matheus Cunha entered. Atlético had blunted City. The game was broken up. Even De Bruyne hoofed clear rather than employing the usual feathery touch. But, now, came Guardiola’s decisive move: Grealish, Gabriel Jesus and Foden joined the fray and the dividend was reaped. The youngster calmly found space and De Bruyne, who gave Oblak no chance. If there is surprise Foden was dropped for this opening leg, the feeling will intensify should Guardiola do the same for the return. It is not the time for him to overthink.",Sport/Football,Kevin De Bruyne gives Manchester City advantage against Atlético Madrid,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/05/manchester-city-atletico-madrid-champions-league-quarter-final-first-leg-match-report
4/6/2022,"Good morning. It looks likely that a federal election will be called by the end of the week after the NSW court of appeal on Tuesday confirmed Scott Morrison’s preferred candidates were valid. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, says he pursued his contentious captain’s picks – sparking a destructive internal Liberal party brawl culminating in election-eve legal challenges – because he wanted to stand up “for the women in my team”. Morrison told the ABC he intervened in the process because “I’m asked all the time why won’t the prime minister do more about getting good women in parliament and stand up for the women in parliament”. Conservative stalwart Concetta Fierravanti-Wells dismissed Morrison’s suggestion he was protecting women. “Morrison is simply using the ‘gender card’ to conflate captain’s picks to trash democratic processes in NSW,” she told 7.30 in a statement. The Morrison government has been accused of sitting on The Australia State of the Environment report, which it received more than three months ago, to avoid “more bad news”. The report, published every five years, was handed to the environment minister, Sussan Ley, in December, and is required to be tabled in parliament within 15 sittings days. But with an election expected to be called within days and parliament having sat only briefly this year, the government is not legally required to release it until the next parliament forms. Despite calls to table the report before the election so voters know the “official state” of the environment, a spokesperson for Ley said she would comply with her statutory obligations. Australia will team up with Britain and the US to develop nuclear-capable hypersonic weapons, after Russia used the deadly high-speed missiles in airstrikes last month during the war in Ukraine. The military agreement is a new element in the Aukus pact, originally announced to provide nuclear-powered submarines to Canberra. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has demanded that Russian leaders be “brought to justice for war crimes”. In an address to the UN security council he said there should be an international tribunal similar to the Nuremberg trials of Nazis after the second world war. Speaking of Russian forces, he said: “There is not a single crime that they would not commit there.” Australia’s first-homebuyers are being urged to enter the scheme “with eyes wide open” and build a financial buffer to withstand increased mortgage repayments due to a “plausible” interest rate rise this year. Australian federal police members are demanding the next government establish “a far-reaching anti-corruption body”, saying the current anti-corruption regime is unequal, holding law enforcement to a far higher standard than politicians. The federal government has drawn criticism for allocating an additional $168.5m to a private company to build the Emu Swamp Dam in Queensland without any explanation for the cost blowout. Outgoing MP George Christensen spent more than $20,000 on Facebook ads to promote his personal website and email list just weeks before quitting politics. Labor has questioned whether taxpayers or Christensen paid for the ads, concerned that the retiring MP “appears to be promoting his own website for his career after politics”. Expectant mothers are being left out of pocket for some antenatal consultations, prompting doctors to call on the federal government to raise the Medicare rebate. Suspected Russian mercenaries participated in an operation with Mali’s army in which about 300 civilians were allegedly executed, Human Rights Watch says. The world economy may be on the cusp of a new inflationary era due to the retreat of globalisation, a leading central bank chief has said. Former US president Donald Trump has admitted he did not win the 2020 election in a video interview with a panel of historians. A prominent Nigerian humanist has been sentenced to 24 years in prison after pleading guilty to blasphemy charges, in a landmark case that has put a new focus on the threats to freedom of expression in the country. Puberty Blues holds a special place in the heart of many Australians.

Even though she now lives in London, Lette will always be a “Shire girl” at heart. After many years navigating the beach, the Cronulla expat has come to consider one item essential for hitting the sand – a terry-towelling poncho. “No middle-aged mum wants to be seen naked by strangers – mainly because, well, our birthday suits probably need a little ironing. The tide would take one look at my bare arse, go out and refuse to come back in again.” “It is estimated that roughly 10% of [aged care] residents require some form of sedation to preserve their wellbeing but far, far more are prescribed drugs to make them more pliant … Last week, the Australian Senate approved legislation mandating the round-the-clock presence of a registered nurse in every nursing home. But given the protean vulnerabilities of residents, it is hard to imagine one nurse shouldering the whole burden of supervising sedation. Could there be a better model of care?” asks Ranjana Srivastava. “If cinema is meant to make us feel something, then the Safdie brothers want us to have a stress-induced aneurysm with 2017 thriller Good Time,” writes Adam Fleet. “Good Time is not the best choice if you are looking to relax on a Friday night. But what’s the point of relaxing anyway? If you’re not chewing off your fingernails and screaming into a sofa cushion, how do you know you’re even alive?” China and Solomon Islands are preparing to sign a historic security agreement that could be a stepping stone to a future Chinese naval base, less than 2,000km from Australia’s east coast. Today’s Full Story features Laura Murphy-Oates and defence correspondent Daniel Hurst discussing China’s growing influence with Pacific Island countries, and why Australian politicians and security experts are concerned about this deal.
