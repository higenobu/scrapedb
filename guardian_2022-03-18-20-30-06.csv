3/18/2022,"The mother of the missing university chef Claudia Lawrence has said “if you give up on hope, you may as well give up altogether” as she marked the 13th anniversary of her daughter’s disappearance. Lawrence, 35, has not been seen since she failed to turn up for work at the University of York in March 2009. Detectives believe she was murdered, but no body has been found despite numerous appeals, arrests and searches. In an interview to mark the 13th anniversary of Lawrence’s disappearance, her mother, Joan Lawrence, said she had been given “hope so many times and it’s been dashed”. She told BBC Radio York on Friday: “I can’t believe it’s 13 years. I shouldn’t be. We should really have had answers before now.” Police work on the case increased last year when the North Yorkshire force spent two weeks searching a lake and nearby woods just outside York. Officers later said that “nothing of obvious significance” was found. Lawrence said: “I have had hope so many times and it’s been dashed. I never give up on hope. If you give up on hope, you might as well give up altogether. “It’s the not knowing. Despite the fact she was 35, she is my child. You can’t say goodbye, you don’t know whether she’s dead, you don’t know if she’s alive, you don’t know where she is, you don’t know what’s happened to her, there’s no grave … It’s still pretty awful, it really is.” Claudia Lawrence’s father, Peter, died last year without knowing what happened to his daughter. He had campaigned to get answers to the puzzle of her disappearance and spent years arguing for what became the Guardianship (Missing Persons) Act – also known as Claudia’s Law – which allows relatives to take control of their missing loved ones’ financial matters. Joan Lawrence said she would continue to try to solve the mystery herself and was reviewing the details “with a fine-toothed comb” for “simple things that have been missed”. North Yorkshire police have conducted two investigations and questioned nine people in relation to her disappearance – and suspected murder – but no charges have ever been brought. Speaking after he took over as the senior investigating officer on the case last year, Det Supt Wayne Fox repeated the belief that several people know, or have suspicions about, what happened to Claudia Lawrence.",News/UK news,Claudia Lawrence’s mother appeals for help 13 years after disappearance,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/18/claudia-lawrence-mother-appeals-for-help-13-years-after-disappearance
3/18/2022,"Was Tupac Shakur depressed? That’s the question that sparked this show about the lauded US rapper, who was murdered in a drive-by shooting in 1996. The show isn’t going to answer that, however. Nor will it give us gangster swagger to the sound of California Love, or anything so obvious. Instead, it’s like a dystopian tour through the imagination of choreographer Malik Nashad Sharpe, who creates performance under the moniker Marikiscrycrycry. The origin of the piece was Sharpe listening to Tupac’s songs Me Against the World and So Many Tears and being struck by the pain that was not far from the surface, even while the rapper’s legend allows no space for vulnerability. Sharpe’s interest is in the humanisation of black bodies, although what we first see is something alienating. An atmosphere of bleak intensity, oppressive and unsettling. Four dancers in tartan bondage pants, leather and fishnet, like a raid on Vivienne Westwood’s 70s archive, with moves from the lexicon of black dance. Dry ice clogs the darkness, alongside a dense soundtrack that’s on the edge of harassment with its warped snarling voices and mega volume. The anger is palpable: Sharpe’s body used as a punch bag; an extended brawl; bodies strewn on the floor. At the climax all that aggression becomes a howl from the gut, with Sharpe bent over, long sung notes turning into looped lyrics: “So many tears”; “I’m suicidal”; raw expression and a pretty voice. The fog clears and we finally see a person in front of us. It’s a confident, original, uncompromising, abstruse performance, unapologetic about taking up space with black and queer bodies, possibly not quite as penetrating as it strives to be, but the work of an intriguing artist to watch.

3/18/2022,"Four months after her son’s murderer was sentenced to life in prison, Sarah Sak received an email from the BBC. The 55-year-old facilities manager wasn’t remotely alarmed to hear that the broadcaster wanted to create a drama about the victims of the so-called “Grindr killer”, Stephen Port, who murdered her son and three others after meeting them on gay dating apps. “I just thought it’d be a really good thing to get out there to the public,” Sak says, explaining that she hoped to raise awareness about the dangers of online dating. In January, Four Lives aired on BBC One – eight years after Sak’s son Anthony Walgate was murdered, six years after Port was sentenced. Sak never worried it was “too soon” to dramatise the events surrounding her son’s death. For her, Four Lives was a way to honour Anthony’s memory, and shed light on the police’s failure to investigate his murder (in December 2021, an inquest ruled that “fundamental failings” by the police contributed to the deaths of Port’s final three victims). Ultimately, the three-episode miniseries was cathartic for Sak, who cried when watching it for the first and second time. Four Lives is one of many TV dramas about remarkably recent events. In February, Netflix debuted Inventing Anna, a nine-episode series about the 2017 arrest of fraudster Anna Sorokin. Sky is currently broadcasting Joe vs Carole, about the animal abuser Joe Exotic, who was convicted in 2019 of hiring hitmen in an attempt to murder his rival, Carole Baskin. These shows aren’t anomalous. Hulu drama The Dropout tells the story of medical startup founder Elizabeth Holmes, and aired just two months after Holmes was convicted of defrauding investors, and six months before her sentencing. It is not just contemporary crimes that are taking over TV. Multiple dramas about the pandemic have already aired, from Netflix’s Social Distance in October 2020 to Channel 4’s Help in September 2021. In the autumn, we will be treated to Sky’s This Sceptred Isle, starring Kenneth Branagh, about the government’s response at the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis. And who can forget Channel 4’s 2019 TV movie Brexit: The Uncivil War, which featured a balding Benedict Cumberbatch as Dominic Cummings, and aired more than a year before the UK’s EU withdrawal agreement was actually ratified? Taken together, these shows raise a number of questions (beyond, of course, “Do we really need to see Kenneth Branagh in a blond Boris Johnson wig?”). Why exactly are we seeing so many recent events dramatised? Should we be worried that television is getting careless about the concept of “too soon”? “Something happens now, and where once three or four years might elapse before somebody might moot dramatising it, now it might be three or four weeks,” says the writer and producer Neil McKay, who created Four Lives and is making a Jimmy Savile drama starring Steve Coogan for the BBC. McKay says he personally would not write about something that happened just weeks ago, but he believes true-crime dramatisations can be liberating for victims and their families, provided they are consulted throughout the production. “If you have a child or relative who is murdered, one of the awful things which immediately happens is you lose privacy,” McKay says. He believes the press is often invasive, while he prides himself on listening to the people at the heart of an incident. “It takes two or three years to listen to the music of the experience of the person you’re talking to,” he says. He read the Four Lives script to Sak at her kitchen table in Hull, invited her and the other victims’ families to visit the set, and showed them the series before it was broadcast. “The key thing is how you treat people,” he says. One of the benefits of dramatising a recent event is that it can be easier to find victims’ families. In 2006, McKay wrote See No Evil: The Moors Murders, a dramatisation of the five child murders carried out by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley in the 1960s. “Finding people and tracking them down is much harder,” McKay says, although relatives of 12-year-old victim John Kilbride ultimately played extras on the show. On the flipside, it can be easier legally to make a show about a historical event. Although Four Lives went into production in 2019, its release was delayed so the show wouldn’t prejudice the jury inquest into police failings. McKay’s methods may be reassuring but not all families are as happy with their treatment. In 2016, ITV aired The Secret, about a Northern Irish dentist who murdered his wife in 1991. The couple’s daughter wrote in the Guardian that the show “[exploited] a tragedy for entertainment” and “propelled [her] into a new world of trauma”. When emailing her, producers spelled her mother’s name wrong. “When media interest goes beyond the reporting of events and is against the wishes of family members, the effects can be as devastating as the murder itself,” she wrote. Dramatisations don’t just affect victims; there is also a risk that they glorify criminals. Before his trial, Port wrote in a letter that Avengers actor Chris Evans could play him in a film, while Exotic was “absolutely thrilled” when Netflix’s first docuseries about him aired in 2020. Many modern shows avoid glorifying criminals by focusing on the journalists and detectives who uncovered crimes, rather than the crimes themselves. This reflects audience appetites, as a number of shows have been adapted from popular podcasts, books and articles – Joe vs Carole is based on Wondery’s Over My Dead Body podcast, while Inventing Anna was inspired by a 2018 New York magazine article that went viral. Fred Black, a research manager at the media analytics firm Ampere Analysis, believes we are seeing so many dramatisations of recent events because streaming giants can “guarantee audience interest”. “In an era of content saturation, recognisability is a key element,” Black says. Yet how much of this is really new? John Caughie, a TV studies affiliate at Glasgow University and author of Television Drama: Realism, Modernism, and British Culture, says dramas in the 70s and 80s often reflected “contemporary social conditions” rather than specific events. Caughie says these shows operated as “state of the nation critiques”. In 1978, for example, the BBC aired TV play The Spongers a year after the Queen’s silver jubilee. The film depicted a single mother struggling on benefits, “cutting down on any ambiguity by filming the opening title The Spongers against a portrait of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh”. Five years later in 1983, the BBC commissioned The Falklands Play just a year after the war ended. Although it was set to air in 1986, it was shelved for fear that its pro-Thatcher stance would compromise the forthcoming general election. The then BBC controller, Michael Grade, also criticised the drama’s “jingoistic tone”. It remains to be seen how audiences will respond to This Sceptred Isle, although McKay’s forthcoming Savile drama, The Reckoning, has already sparked a backlash, with the BBC accused of hypocrisy given its decades-long relationship with the predatory presenter. BBC drama controller Piers Wenger has defended the show, saying: “It is a decade since Jimmy Savile died. It’ll be a decade next year since his behaviours first came into the public eye … Our primary intention with the drama is to give voice to the victims and to tell their stories sensitively.” The Falklands Play eventually aired on BBC Four in 2002 – the 20th anniversary of the war. For Caughie, the play “illustrates the problem of dramatising [recent] events, because we don’t know what they mean until quite a while afterwards.” Yet some argue that drama helps raise awareness of current issues. In 2002, ITV aired a drama about the crimes of Harold Shipman, just two years after he was found guilty of murdering 15 patients in his care. Michael Eaton, writer of Harold Shipman: Doctor Death, says he wanted to cover the story after he heard people claim Shipman was only “helping dying patients on their way”. He spoke with some of the victims’ families while making the show, and they were shown an early screening alongside police officers who investigated the crime. “Definitely some people there thought that it was too soon, but I wondered: if not now, when?” Eaton said. “The falsehoods around the story needed to be addressed.” For Eaton, drama is superior to documentary when it comes to “the exploration of more personal dimensions” (though he argues scriptwriters can create fictional composite characters to deal with the issues rather than focusing on real people). For McKay, “documentaries are brilliant … but it can’t quite put you inside of the experience”. The question of when something is “too soon” is first answered by victims and their families – then, ultimately, the audience. Sak has written a book, A Life Stolen: The Tragic True Story of My Son’s Murder, because she believes no three-hour drama can contain the entirety of her family’s story. Still, “I think Neil did an absolutely fantastic job,” she says; she thinks Anthony, too, would have been happy with Four Lives. “Because his world was all about him, obviously. He was a young, gay student in London and the whole world revolved around Anthony, according to him,” Sak says. “I think he’d be really pleased. He’d be like: ‘Yeah, you’re all still talking about me!’”",Arts/Television & radio,"Too real, too soon?

3/18/2022,"When the war started I stopped looking in the mirror. I would meet my neighbours and saw terror and pain stamped on their faces, their eyes empty. I didn’t want to see that in my own reflection. Klavdievo-Tarasovo is a large village about 40km north-west of Kyiv. There are only two shops and about 5,000 people. On the first day of the invasion, I got a call from my best friend who lives in Kyiv. “Wake up! Russia is attacking us,” she said, urging me to escape to my 27-year-old daughter, Sasha, in Surrey. I drove to get gas, but the queues stretched for about 3km. My friend arrived at 7pm to shelter with her 18-year-old son. We found a safe corner of the house, laid blankets and used it as a bunker during explosions. We slept there on the floor. When the house trembled, my dogs Pippa and Varya, a rough collie and black labrador, were scared. But I scratched their heads and told them: “Everything will be good.” They helped us emotionally. I went to the village shops but they were empty, except for crisps. Luckily I still had bread, meat and fish in the fridge. My daughter called me and said: “Get out!” But I didn’t want to escape alone – there were rumours of lone travellers being shot. Russian military jets were flying so low over the house I could see the pilots in the cabin. Once, I was outside and expected them to shoot, so I fell to the ground and rolled to the nearest fence. I felt paralysed by fear; the hopelessness of feeling how small I was. I realised I needed to leave and get to my daughter – at any cost. But with the main roads damaged it was difficult. Then the electricity went black and the cell tower was hit. It felt like you were a mouse caught in a trap. Villages like mine were totally cut off. I roamed the countryside to get an SMS signal – sometimes for 15 minutes, sometimes for two hours, sometimes with no luck. I could only text Ukrainian numbers, so first I’d message friends in Kyiv who would tell Sasha I was still alive. I’d filled up the bathtub with water while I still could. I tried speaking to neighbours about leaving together but many of them had lived in the village their entire lives and wanted to stay. It was scary to leave alone but I kept looking for a way out. The fridge lost its cooling power and the meat and fish were going off. We shared what we could with neighbours, and I cooked spaghetti in an old-style oven that was heated by burning logs. We didn’t throw anything away. But food was running out. In Klavdievo, we felt like we were forgotten and alone after the third day. People were without food, water, drugs, electricity, mobile connection or heat in freezing temperatures – left to fend for themselves without external support. Even friends in Kyiv had relatively normal lives: going to the supermarket, pharmacies. We were forgotten. On the day before the war, I bought 10kg of dog biscuits for Pippa and Varya. On day six, I had to eat some myself. They were like very untasty, dry crisps. But I didn’t care. I forced myself to eat to give me the energy to escape. I’d made a promise to Sasha: I will survive. We were able to swap tea and coffee with neighbours for food such as potatoes. But the same day we ran out of bathtub water. Afterwards, we boiled water from some neighbours’ wells to drink, which tasted disgusting and metallic. And the few times it snowed, we would gather snow in bowls, take it indoors to melt, then boil it before drinking. People get used to the stress of explosions very fast. But sometimes it would go as quiet as the mountains. This silence was even more terrifying; in this invasion they’ve bombed our cities, shot our citizens – we didn’t know what to expect. Putin is not human at all, like the devil. It was horrible without information about the war. Friends from Kyiv were giving us updates when they could, but we already knew the Russians were close. We heard the gunfire. It’s scary to know the enemy is nearby, but even worse to feel as if you’re in no man’s land, between Russians and Ukrainians. There were no humanitarian corridors. I met a local man who was organising a convoy of 40 cars from local villages to leave together. Safety in numbers. A Klavdievo neighbour helped take my generator apart and extract the diesel to fill up my car. Someone knew an alternative route through dirt roads to get us out. I left my dogs with a woman who worked as a housekeeper, giving her food after she declined the offer to leave with me. I was crying. The dogs didn’t understand I was going, but I said to them: “Please forgive me.” I was so scared. I didn’t know if I was making the right decision. But I had to see my daughter. Sasha begged me: “Don’t die, I need you.” That was my main motivation. The drive was terrifying. As we passed multiple Ukrainian checkpoints, soldiers said to us: “Russians could shoot you from either left or right.” You didn’t know what was coming. Later, we turned a corner and saw tanks with the letter Z on them. It was a Russian checkpoint. We watched as the tank-guns slowly aimed at our cars. It was like watching a war film, your brain refused to understand that your life could end in two seconds. They checked everything – documents, cars, suitcases – then let us go. The next day I crossed the border to Romania, and later reunited with Sasha in Budapest. Seeing her in the airport terminal, we just hugged and cried. For some emotions there are no words. When I finally looked in the mirror for the first time since the invasion, I looked older – as though each day of the war had been another year. But I also felt guilty to be safe and sound while others in ​​Klavdievo were still facing inhumane conditions. I’m begging Zelenskiy to help these villages with humanitarian aid.",News/World news,‘I felt paralysed by fear’: woman describes escape from Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/i-felt-paralysed-by-fear-mother-describes-escape-from-russia-invasion-ukraine
3/18/2022,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will have a profound impact on the world’s race to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions, climate experts have warned – but it may not all be negative. Vladimir Putin’s attempts to wield his dominance over European energy supplies as a weapon to limit interference in his war appear in danger of backfiring. Europe is embarking on a clean energy push that could reduce Russian gas imports by more than two-thirds, while the UK will set out an energy security strategy within days that will emphasise renewable power. In the US – as well as pumping more fossil fuels – president Joe Biden is renewing efforts to pass his mauled green investment package. David Blood, the prominent financier who with Al Gore founded Generation Investment Management, believes the Ukraine war should boost green energy. “The irony is, this war is funded by the west’s dependence on Russian hydrocarbons. There is now significant evidence to show that hydrocarbons are not just environmentally unsustainable, but that they weaken the social, political and economic fabric of our world too,” he said. “This war provides even more evidence of why there is no time to waste in transitioning away from fossil fuels and towards a cleaner future.” This fresh impetus to decarbonisation probably caught Putin by surprise, as he had been “happy to use climate to exacerbate tensions within the west”, said Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University in the US, and a former high-ranking World Bank climate expert. She said EU countries’ commitment last year to reach net zero emissions by 2050 may have fed into the Russian president’s calculation that he should no longer delay his long-standing ambitions over Ukraine. Every step towards clean energy in Europe diminishes his economic hold over EU states: Europe gets 40% of its gas from Russia, rising to 60% for Germany, but that demand must all but disappear by 2050 if the net zero aspirations are to be met. “Putin’s understanding of what decarbonisation, especially in Europe, would mean for Russian energy exports in the medium and long term may have been one factor in the timing of his invasion of Ukraine now,” said Kyte. “The more time passed, so the appetite for fossil fuels would diminish. However, the nature of the west’s pivot away from Russian fuel in response was likely not part of the calculus.” In the long-running UN annual negotiations on the climate, Russia has played a low-key but not outwardly obstructive role for decades. Todd Stern, former US climate envoy under president Barack Obama, and who helped negotiate the 2015 Paris climate agreement, said Russia “didn’t try to throw sand in the gears” but did little to help. “Nothing I’ve ever seen suggests [Putin] has had any desire to be an active, high-ambition player,” he added. “I doubt climate has entered into his calculations except when he thinks he can get something for it.” Something Putin could get for it has been to foment populist culture wars, particularly in the US where he acted, according to Kyte, as the “climate whisperer” to president Donald Trump, “encouraging scepticism of scientific consensus”. Russian social media bots and troll farms honed their disinformation techniques for years on lies about climate science. Yet Putin himself is believed not to be a climate denier, and listens to Russian experts who have made clear the climate chaos that will come from rising carbon emissions. The deeper question is whether the Russian president regards those ravages as a problem. Heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, floods and rising sea levels will scour the planet, but those impacts will be diffused across the vast landmass of Russia – the biggest country on the planet, but sparsely populated compared with rivals such as China, India and the US. According to the comprehensive report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, published at the end of February, Russia will fare far better in terms of the impact on agriculture than regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, south Asia and the US. Its productivity for some key crops such as wheat could increase. The biggest risk the IPCC found to Russia was permafrost thaw. Putin is even hoping to exploit some aspects of the climate crisis, such as the melting of the Arctic ice cap, which could open up new shipping passages and make oil and gas drilling easier. Russia is notably pushing its Arctic territorial claims, even while invading Ukraine. Paul Bledsoe, a former Clinton White House climate change adviser, says the Russian president has no scruples over inflicting climate catastrophe on the rest of the world, while seeking advantages for himself. “Putin has acted with utter contempt for the climate, just as he has violated all norms on human rights and international sovereignty,” said Bledsoe, who is now at the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington DC. “He is planning massive new oil and gas developments in the Arctic, which would devastate that fragile region, including by hastening the disappearance of Arctic sea ice, which is crucial to global climate stability. And he has done nothing to prevent Siberian tundra melt, which will unleash gigantic new methane releases. Putin has made Russia a climate outlaw state.” In an optimistic analysis, if the Ukraine war accelerates the shift to renewable energy in the EU, the UK and the US, it could mark a turning point for the world’s efforts to decarbonise. Campaigners warn the opposite could also be true, and an expanded role for fossil fuels could push the goal of staying within 1.5C of global heating out of reach. But Stern believes that fear could be overdone. “What China does or does not do to meet the call of the Glasgow climate pact to ramp up its [emissions-cutting target] will almost surely have much greater impact on account both of China’s carbon footprint, and the power of its example for other high-emitting developing countries,” he said. “Whether the US Congress delivers climate legislation will also make a big difference.” Even in the best case, however, the human cost and suffering inflicted recklessly and willingly by Putin in Ukraine will cast a deep shadow over the world’s efforts to prevent climate breakdown. Governments scrambling to deal with the military threat, the refugee crisis and the economic impacts of this Russian-made crisis will be in a poorer position to concentrate on the looming threat of the climate emergency. “By definition, [the war] demands intensive focus and so diminishes the amount that relevant leaders focus on climate,” said Stern. “When you’re trying to get big things done, that diminishing of focus can matter.”",News/Environment,Could Ukraine war help end west’s reliance on hydrocarbons?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/18/could-ukraine-war-help-end-wests-reliance-on-hydrocarbons
3/18/2022,"The pay of BP’s boss, Bernard Looney, ballooned to nearly £4.5m in 2021, after soaring oil prices transformed the company into a “cash machine”. Looney, who in February announced BP was selling its 20% stake in the Kremlin-controlled oil company Rosneft after coming under pressure from the UK government, enjoyed an inflated pay packet thanks to £2.4m in bonuses based on financial performance. His reward was unveiled after the FTSE 100 firm reported its biggest profit in eight years. It booked earnings of $12.8bn (£9.45bn) for 2021, compared with a loss of $5.7bn the year before, after cashing in on historic highs in the market price for gas and oil. The same price increases, since aggravated by the war in Ukraine, have fuelled a cost of living crisis for Britons. Household energy bills are predicted to reach as much as £3,000 a year and petrol prices as much as £2.40 a litre. Labour has called on Rishi Sunak to introduce a windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies to help pay for policies to ease the cost of living crisis, but the chancellor has rejected the idea. Having received no bonus in 2020, the extra sum Looney received for 2021, together with a £142,000 wage increase, meant that his total pay-and-perks deal soared to nearly £4.5m, compared with £2.4m in 2020. The company said his windfall had been adjusted to ensure that he was not simply benefiting from the effect of rising oil prices, which he has previously said have turned the company into a “cash machine”. The award covers the year before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which has forced BP into promising to sell its 20% stake in Rosneft after the government expressed “concern” about the decade-old link. Looney was one of two BP representatives on the Rosneft board, thanks to a 2013 deal that was announced at the company’s London headquarters by his predecessor, Bob Dudley, and Igor Sechin, widely seen as Vladimir Putin’s righthand man. Before vowing to cut ties with Russia, Looney had also come under scrutiny for his role in the Russian Geographical Society, for which he received Putin’s personal thanks. BP is expected to take a writedown of up to $25bn from its disposal of the Rosneft stake, with sanctions on Russia complicating its hopes of finding a buyer.",News/Business,BP boss Bernard Looney’s pay almost doubles to £4.5m in 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/18/bp-boss-bernard-looney-almost-doubles-pay-to-45m-in-2021
3/18/2022,"A Russian missile attack near Lviv airport has raised fears of Vladimir Putin’s war spreading to western Ukraine, as Russia claimed to be “tightening the noose” around the south-eastern port city of Mariupol. A facility for repairing military aircraft by Lviv’s international airport – only 43 miles from Poland’s border – was hit by two cruise missiles fired from the Black Sea on Friday morning. Ukrainian officials said they had shot down a further four missiles launched in the attack, the second on facilities near the historic city in recent days. The strikes raise the spectre of Ukraine losing what has so far been a relative haven and hub for refugees and humanitarian aid. At least 35 people were killed and 134 wounded on Sunday after more than 30 Russian cruise missiles targeted a military facility outside Lviv and only 15 miles from Poland’s border. Russia’s bombardment in the east of Ukraine continued on Friday. The Kremlin’s defence ministry claimed its forces and pro-Russian separatists were fighting directly in the streets of Mariupol, where 350,000 civilians have been stranded with little food or water. “In Mariupol, units of the Donetsk People’s Republic, with the support of the Russian armed forces, are squeezing the encirclement and fighting against nationalists in the city centre,” the ministry in Moscow said. A spokesperson claimed Russia’s armed forces were “tightening the noose“ around the city. In the eastern city of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s state emergency service said a multi-storey teaching building had been shelled on Friday morning, killing one person, wounding 11 and trapping one other in the rubble. Shells were also said to have struck the eastern city of Kramatorsk, killing two people and wounding six. One person was killed and four others wounded after parts of a Russian missile fell on a residential building in the northern part of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. Emergency services said 12 people had been rescued and 98 evacuated from the five-storey block. The governor of Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region said frequent and widespread shelling by Russian forces was preventing the safe evacuation of civilians from towns and villages on the frontline. The attack near Lviv, where there were no reported casualties, will be a cause for concern for refugees and humanitarian agencies working in the city. Russia has in recent days accused the exacerbating the war by supplying military aid via the western border, claiming such efforts were a legitimate military target. James Heappey, a UK defence minister, said the attacks would not stand in the way of the British government and its allies from arming the Ukrainian forces. He said: “It is very much a part of war that you go after each other’s supply lines. But the reality is this development will be a concern for people living in the west of Ukraine.” Heappey said the UK was training Ukrainian soldiers to use the Starstreak anti-aircraft missile system supplied by Britain and which would arrive in the country “imminently”. Lviv, a Unesco world heritage site, had been largely untouched by bombings until Friday, although many of its 700,000 inhabitants had feared an attack was a matter of time. The city has been described as the soul of Ukraine and a symbol of Ukrainian nationalism. Its citizens were among the strongest supporters of the country’s separation from the Soviet Union. The developments followed accusations from the US, UK and EU that Russia was committing war crimes in Ukraine, while the French government accused Putin of pretending to be interested in a negotiated peace. On Friday, Putin told the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, during a phone call that Kyiv was “attempting to stall peace talks” with Russia but Moscow was still keen to continue negotiations. “It was noted that the Kyiv regime is attempting in every possible way to delay the negotiation process, putting forward more and more unrealistic proposals,” the Kremlin said in a readout of the call. “Nonetheless, the Russian side is ready to continue searching for a solution in line with its well-known principled approaches.” In a phone call on Friday, the US president, Joe Biden, will warn his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, that he will face “costs” if Beijing rescues its fellow authoritarian ally Russia from intense western sanctions aimed at punishing Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.",News/World news,Russian strikes on Lviv raise fears of Ukraine war spreading west,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/russia-missile-lviv-mariupol-ukraine-war

Google map of the routeThere are two tales about how the Lister Arms got its name. According to the respectable account, the inn commemorates one Thomas Lister, landowner and local grandee who was MP for Clitheroe from 1713-45. The prominent Lister family owned the manor of Gisburn, 12 miles to the south and had interests across Yorkshire and Lancashire. The more colourful story – as told by Tim, the pub’s convivial waiter, whose mum has lived in Malham for 27 years – has it that the Listers were “three brothers from Bradford, or somewhere down in the West Riding, who bought the property to keep their mistresses in”. When a wife or wives found out – some time in the 18th century – there was a great to-do and the place was sold and became a coaching inn. My bet is these are the same story as told with or without drink, or perhaps the cads of the second version were earlier Listers. With a tiny bit of research I learned that Thomas Lister was a fighter, hunter and sailor. He carefully surveyed the Malham estate and then – less carefully – used it for mining calamine (an ore of zinc), fishing, farming and shooting. This explains the antlers that adorn the pub interior. It also explains why the area is awash with quarries, lime kilns, sheep, stone walls and pheasants. My suggested walk is more a meander or mooch, as a purely linear walk will finish at a spot where you will struggle to find even a weekly bus, and a circular walk can be tricky – as will soon become obvious. Head out of Malham, leaving the pub car park and crossing the old bridge. A little way along is Yorkshire Dales national park centre, which was helpfully closed all day when I visited on a sunny Thursday in autumn. Opposite is a gravel (later flagstone) path on the far bank of a stream; it’s actually the Pennine Way but don’t go telling everyone you’ve “done the Way” as you’ll be leaving it in about 200 metres. Follow the turquoise signs for Janet’s Foss, which will plunge you into a sylvan wonder. It really is the prettiest of woods, run by the National Trust to protect ash, birch and hazel trees, wood sorrel and ferns. A lovely touch is the Bee Library: wooden book-shaped hives for solitary bees. Note the outcrops of limestone that push up against the tree roots here – it’s the first hint of what’s to come. When I visited, the beck was flowing fast and as clear as I’ve ever seen a stream Soon the beck rises towards steps and, eventually, a waterfall, which was cascading loudly following recent heavy rain. The waterfall is called Janet’s Foss (named after a fairy queen said to live in a cave here and the Old Norse word for “force” or “waterfall”). I was alone here for a spell, which I think is quite rare. Soon I was joined by a couple of other walkers – who gasped at the beauty of the place as shafts of sunlight illuminated the spray – and by two women who had come to swim in the bracing pool. A little way past the waterfall is a road, then, to the left, a path leading to Gordale Scar; it’s very well sign-posted, with the track continuing on the right side of the same beck. The grass is heavily grazed here and, being flat, looks like a lawn. In front is a great wall of rock and a narrow cleft. This is the scar or gorge, formed by ice and torrents of glacial meltwater over several ice ages. It’s possible to scramble up the rocks and, indeed, there were a couple of not particularly steady-looking folk hopping hither and thither when I visited. But the water was thundering down and the flow put me off, so a circular walk was a non-starter. We tend to think of limestone as white and smooth, but the water here freights material from the moorland soils and deposits calcium which, mixed with algae and microbes, leaves behind a spongy, golden brown rock called tufa. Some rocks look like gnarled old trees, others like massive golden nuggets. I was awestruck by Gordale Scar: it’s as impressive a ravine as any I’ve seen in countries where landscapes are much grander. Retracing my steps to the road, I took a path marked Malham Cove. After a short and easy climb to another signpost, I opted for the northbound footpath to Malham Tarn. This upland lake, left behind by a melted glacier, emanates the sort of serenity only a large body of water can – helped here by the wide-open moorland. Under a clear sky it was dark blue. There were good views south, to pointy Sharp Haw and all the way to Pendle Hill. A short backtrack downhill and I was soon close to the gate into Malham Cove – a magnificent sheer limestone cliff and amphitheatre-cum-shelf. The sight of 20 or so walkers moving around the top, not to mention school parties eating packed lunches, briefly detracted from the wonder of the place. But once I got close and on to the lumpy limestone I forgot all about the other people (of necessity, as a misstep could lead to lodging a foot inside a deep chasm). A staircase and paved path lead back to Malham from here, affording lots of other angles on the site – enlivened by views of jackdaws riding the air currents with astonishing manoeuvrability. The Foss, Tarn and Cove are three superb spots; any walk between these will be memorable, and you can’t really get lost (though if it’s misty you should take OS Explorer map OL2). If the area has one flaw, it’s the sheep farming. More upland trees and fewer woolly grazers would enhance the Unesco-worthy site’s raw beauty. I blame Lister or the Listers. Ribble Valley brewery Thwaites has many lovely pubs in the north of England. The Lister Arms, with its stone floors and fireplaces, old photos of dray horses, and handsome woodburner, is one of the nicest. Waiter Tim told me they serve 12,000 steak-and-ale pies a year, so I had to have one, with chips, mushy peas and gravy. It is a perfect winter lunch, as a ploughman’s would be in summer. The pie, with a crust to swoon over, arrived as Frank Sinatra’s Strangers in the Night played over the sound system and, for a moment, it felt like a honeymoon. Thwaites’ Gold, Original (bitter) and IPA were all available but not, sadly, the mild (though the barman said they sell shedloads when it’s on). Other tasty options were a Hetton pale ale and Settle ale. I could also have had a Yorkshire cream tea. Bike parking and locks are available. Rooms in the inn, the adjoining cottage or the converted barn (a mere beck’s crossing away) have soft beds, tartan throws, beamed or sloping ceilings and a full Yorkshire breakfast (or smashed aubergine and avocado, because hipsters do walking holidays too). All also come with fresh milk, good biscuits and a telly. Groups can book the whole barn (phone for details), with eight bedrooms and a boot room, a woodburner and its own garden.
