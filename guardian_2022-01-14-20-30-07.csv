1/14/2022,"The Hollywood blockbuster Spider-Man: No Way Home pulled in the cinema crowds in December, driving Cineworld’s box office revenues to almost 90% of pre-pandemic levels despite the rapid spread of Omicron over the festive season. The world’s second-largest cinema operator, the owner of the Cineworld and Regal Picturehouse chains in the UK and Regal Cinemas in the US, said that across its global business, box office and concession revenue hit 88% of 2019 levels in December. In the UK and Ireland revenues hit 89% of pre-pandemic levels, and 91% in the US.  Cineworld credited the phenomenal success of the latest Spider-Man film, which has taken £80m in the UK despite the reintroduction of face masks in cinemas to curb the spread of Omicron days before its release and has become the only film to make more than $1.5bn (£1.1bn) globally since the pandemic began. “Spider-Man: No Way Home has shown the importance for studios of cinematic releases,” said Mooky Greidinger, the chief executive of Cineworld. “We are pleased to see continued strong demand among audiences for cinema experiences, supported by a slate of high-quality and high-performing movies.” The London-listed company said October proved to be the best month of the year, with the release of James Bond: No Time to Die sending revenues in the UK and Ireland to 127% of 2019 levels, pushing its global box office and concession income to 90% of pre-pandemic. However, Cineworld said that the pushing back of the release of Tom Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick to May this year hurt its November income, which was only 56% of pre-pandemic levels. Nevertheless, the performance across the three-month period was strong enough to make the struggling company cashflow positive. Investors welcomed the news, sending Cineworlds’s shares up almost 4% in early trading, making the company one of the biggest risers on the FTSE 250. “This demonstrates that fans are continuing to choose the unrivalled theatrical experience,” Greidinger said. “We are continuing to implement guidelines to ensure our cinemas are a safe environment for our customers. While there are challenges ahead, we are excited to welcome customers to our cinemas to enjoy the highly anticipated slate of movies throughout 2022.” The UK and Ireland box office hit £597m last year, 85% up on 2020, led by No Time to Die, which made £97m, making it the third-highest grossing film of all-time, after the franchise stablemate Skyfall, and Star Wars: The Force Awakens. However, the cinema industry has a long road ahead to reach pre-pandemic levels, with annual box office revenues reaching £1.3bn in each of the five years up to 2019.",News/Business,Spider-Man drives Cineworld revenues to near pre-pandemic levels,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/14/spider-man-drives-cineworld-revenues-to-near-pre-pandemic-levels
1/14/2022,"Max Fordham, who has died aged 88, changed the way that buildings in Britain are heated, lit, powered and ventilated more than any other engineer of his generation. Trained in the sciences, he brought a new creative and intellectual rigour to the problems of plumbing and wiring, bringing the disparate building services trades together in a single holistic approach. Tackling problems from first principles, he founded his practice on the idea of engineers embedding scientific knowledge in the art of building design, in a way that has since become ubiquitous. He always instructed colleagues to “start with the edge of the universe as a boundary and quickly narrow down to the specific problem”. While other engineers might reach for the ventilation grille catalogue, Fordham began by asking how air should enter a room, and why. At a time when heating and lighting was usually an afterthought, he worked with architects from the very beginning of the design process, developing practical, elegant, low-energy solutions, pioneering sustainable design long before the term was coined.  From the Alexandra Road housing estate in north London to Tate St Ives, to the Contact theatre in Manchester, he championed natural daylighting, passive solar heating and airtight construction in ways that have since been adopted and codified as standard practice. Sustainability should be a given, he thought, if something is designed well. When he set up his practice in 1966 with his wife, Thalia “Taddy” Dyson, working out of their bedroom, it was one of the first firms in the UK to conceive the building services as a single discipline, combining previously siloed trades. As Fordham said in a 2017 interview: “I remember going to meetings with engineers for electrical, public health and mechanical ventilation – it seemed bonkers.” Instead, his would be a one-stop shop. His big break came when the architecture firm Arup Associates, where he had started out in his career, asked him to design the heating system for the 1,000-flat Hulme 5 housing estate in Manchester, for which he came up with a new method of sizing and drawing up pipes. He developed a style of detailed technical drawing that became an exemplar for future projects, presenting the information for the entire scheme on just three sheets of A3 paper. Soon after, he was commissioned to work on Neave Brown’s Alexandra Road estate in Camden, London, for which he designed a novel heating system cast into the concrete party walls. This led to work on Newport high school, by Evans & Shalev architects, completed in 1972, which saw an extraordinary level of detailing for the time, such as conduits threaded through preformed holes in the structural columns, so that sockets appeared to emerge seamlessly from the concrete. Such invention continued throughout Fordham’s career, with solutions such as the glazing apertures at Tate St Ives in Cornwall, designed like a camera iris, to control the levels of daylight reaching sensitive artworks, or the Royal Exchange theatre in Manchester, where the air distribution, seating and electrics were all completely integrated in a high-tech pod worthy of a Nasa landing module. The Joseph Banks building at Kew Gardens, built in 1984, incorporated ground source heat pumps decades before they became mainstream, while the design of the roof lights for the National Trust headquarters in Swindon massively reduced the need for artificial lighting. For the Caspar low-cost housing project in Leeds, completed in 2000 (later demolished over structural concerns), Fordham used airtightness to reduce heat loss, meaning all the heating the flats needed came from the residents’ body heat – and a 50-watt lightbulb. The lessons of Caspar informed the design of Fordham’s own house in Camden, built in 2019, which incorporated automatic sliding thermal shutters designed to cover the windows at night when they would lose the most heat. Prototyped using pieces of Lego Technic, the mechanism was inspired by the seal of car windows, which Fordham noted remain airtight at 80 miles an hour. As the defining building services engineer of the era, he often found himself working for competing teams of architects. A series of Chinese walls had to be erected in the office for the Kew competition, when the firm found themselves working with 32 rival practices. More recently, for the Windermere Jetty Museum competition, they were on 63 different teams. Born in Highgate, north London, Max was the son of Molly (nee Swabey), a journalist at Vogue magazine and the News Chronicle newspaper, and Michael Fordham, a Jungian child psychiatrist. He attended the progressive Dartington Hall boarding school in Devon, which he remembered fondly as having a “completely undisciplined environment”. There was no uniform, classes were optional, and the day began with a period of mandatory “useful work”, where students helped to maintain the school buildings. Fordham became skilled in carpentry and metalwork, learning about push-fit and compression pipework, and made an electric hotplate for the kitchen. He likened his schooldays to an apprenticeship, during which he first discovered a love of designing and problem-solving as well as leadership: he was elected chairman of the pupil-run democracy for several years. The democratic and mildly anarchic structure of the school would go on to have a strong influence on the organisation of his own practice. Following two years of national service as a pilot in the Fleet Air Arm, Fordham read natural sciences at Trinity College, Cambridge, specialising in chemistry, physics, maths and mineralogy. He found the narrow focus of life as a pure scientist unappealing, preferring the company of arts and humanities students. His housemate Simon Nicholson, son of the artists Ben Nicholson and Barbara Hepworth, introduced him to a creative circle of architects and artists, including Sir Leslie Martin, architect of the Royal Festival Hall and head of the university’s architecture department. Martin suggested Fordham consider a career in heating and ventilation engineering, where he could apply his aptitude for theoretical physics to an industry that was then lacking in such skills. Graduating in 1957, Fordham began working as a development engineer at Weatherfoil Heating Systems, a contracting company, which gave him a broad introduction to the building industry. There he designed an innovative fan convection heating system for Martin’s celebrated Harvey Court student accommodation building in Cambridge, and was named as the inventor when it was patented. He met Taddy around this time, marrying in 1960. She introduced him to her landlord, the architect Sir Philip Dowson, founding partner of the Building Group at Ove Arup engineers (now Arup Associates). Dowson offered him a job, and Fordham spent the next five years honing his technical skills, mastering an ability to draw all of the building services in complete detail, expanding his repertoire to include mechanical and electrical engineering, as well as public health, before setting up his own firm. Fordham often said that the design of the practice itself was something he was as proud of as any building. In 1973, motivated by the plight of precariously employed dockers, he turned his company into a co-operative, with the slogan: “Anyone fit to be an employee is fit to be a partner.” The principle was expanded in 2001, when the firm became the first business in the British construction industry to become a limited liability partnership (LLP). “It’s not a profit-sharing scheme,” Fordham said, “but a responsibility-sharing scheme.” In an echo of his schooldays, the majority of the company could decide to overthrow the leadership at any time. As a voracious polymath, he preferred not to employ building services graduates, but hired people with a broad range of backgrounds, from zoology to botany, product design and mathematics. As one colleague recalled: “Max’s skill was to take brilliant people, who didn’t know anything whatsoever about building services, and give them space to think.” He was interested in absolutely everything, they added, “which wasn’t always completely easy for the people around him”. A question about a design problem would often turn into a philosophical conversation long into the night, ranging from thermodynamics to trade winds and the origins of the universe. Alongside the practice, Fordham was a visiting professor at the University of Bath from 1990 until his death, and received numerous honours, including being made OBE in 1994. Taddy died in 2017. He is survived by their three sons, Jason, Cato and Finn, and four grandchildren.

1/14/2022,"In New York, some things never change. If you die in a fire, it’s always your fault. When a fire started in a heater and ripped down the hallway of an apartment building in December 1998, killing four people in a blast of heat and smoke, city officials framed the fire as a tragedy that could have been avoided if people had only remembered to close their doors. “People should close the door behind them when leaving a [burning] apartment,” said then-fire chief Daniel Nigro – now the city’s fire commissioner. “They would not have died if they had stayed in their apartments,” said the city’s then-mayor, the now-infamous Rudolph Giuliani, musing that it’s “easier to blame things on mechanisms rather than on what human beings understand, do or don’t do”.  When a space heater torched a Bronx apartment building on 9 January and killed 17 people, making it the city’s deadliest fire in decades, New York’s brand-new mayor Eric Adams knew exactly what to say: “Close the door, close the door,” said Adams on Monday, the day after the fire. “Muscle memory is everything, and if we can drill that in, we can save lives by closing the doors, not only in the city but across the entire globe.” Landlords run this town. They always have, and perhaps they always will. So it should come as no surprise that one of Twin Parks’ investors, Rick Gropper, is on the new mayor’s transition team – for housing, no less. Twin Parks is owned by a consortium of investors, including LIHC Investment Group, Belveron Partners, and Camber Property Group. Gropper cofounded Camber with Andrew Moelis, the son of one of New York’s top affordable housing developers; housing organizers call Ron Moelis the “gentrification king” of New York. The building management was not at fault, Adams told the nation, on Good Morning America; the building only had “two violations that were outstanding in the last few years”. Technically, the mayor was half right: as of Sunday, only two violations remained outstanding with the city’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) – out of 13 violations total in the past year alone. But a closer look at city records tells a different story. Over the past 11 months, Twin Parks North West racked up a litany of complaints to the city’s complaint line: no heat in 6K; broken pipe; broken or missing radiator; no heat; broken or missing door; electric wiring exposed; ventilator system missing; no heat or hot water in 6E; no heat in 18E; no heat in 6K; and the list goes on. The complaint history for this building. Note the frequent complaints of NO HEAT: pic.twitter.com/UmNwATvUOC Gropper and Moelis deserve blame for their poor management of Twin Parks. But the real scandal is that in the landscape of New York City real estate developers, they are not uniquely evil. (After all, this is the world that brought us current Giuliani legal client and former American president Donald Trump.) The Right to Counsel coalition, a group of tenant’s rights organizations, drew up a list of the city’s top 20 evictors during the pandemic. Compared to the others, many of whom specialize in affordable housing, Camber didn’t even rate. And this is perhaps the most stinging indictment of the city’s mega-billion-dollar affordable housing industry. “What exists in New York City, and what has existed in New York City for decades, is a culture of intentional neglect of low-income housing,” said Luis Henríquez Carrero, director of litigation at Legal Services of New York City, which every year handles about a thousand legal cases about bad living conditions in apartments. Contrary to Giuliani’s 1998 musings, it is a lot easier to blame human beings than it is to blame mechanisms. But the real culprit in Sunday’s fire isn’t the mayor, or even the landlords. It’s something more abstract than a broken door, a space heater, or even a bad management company. The fuel for fires like the one in the Bronx is money – specifically, the flood of investment money that is pouring into so-called affordable housing from investors all over the globe. “There are very few asset classes with more proven resilience and staying power than affordable housing, and competition for deals in the five boroughs remains extremely high,” Andrew Gendron of LIHC told The Real Deal last week – announcing his acquisition, in partnership with Camber, of a $68m portfolio in East Harlem. That’s real estate for “there’s gold in them there hills”. The financialization of poverty – and specifically, of affordable housing – has created a gold rush. And when the money floods in, it changes neighborhoods in ways that don’t necessarily benefit people in buildings such as Twin Parks. Follow the money, and you will find a line from the broken doors and heaters in buildings all over the city to the big banks that finance affordable housing deals. “When you make the decision to stop directly funding housing for the poor, and you decide to involve private entities to do it for you, then you introduce market forces into the process of providing affordable housing,” says Henríquez. “And those market forces have created an incentive on many of the landlords to neglect their properties for many decades, to where we see things like the tragedy at Twin Parks.” The result of all this investment, as longtime Bronx resident Eileen Markey points out in a recent dispatch for the New Republic, is that many of the buildings in the Bronx are bearing mortgages worth much more than the net operating income (NOI) of the buildings can produce. Landlords who “bought up buildings at speculative prices, gambling on ever-increasing rents – and quite literally banking on the ability to oust low-income tenants – are faced with declining buildings they can’t afford to maintain and investors they are obliged to serve”, she writes. This is the heart of the problem. If housing vulnerable people is an asset class – not a social good, or a human right – then generating returns for investors will always be in a zero-sum relationship with providing safe housing for those people. Landlords will always be in the middle; and when they’re taking sides, as they must in housing for profit, investors will always win. “When housing is a commodity, and making repairs is a cost – and like any cost, it needs to be minimized so that profit can be maximized – no law changes that basic fact,” says Henríquez. “Providing safe and decent habitable conditions for your tenants falls on the cost side of your balance sheet. And so that already creates an incentive to do as little as possible. To keep that cost as low as possible.” Annia Ciezadlo is a journalist based in New York City",Opinion/Opinion,The Bronx fire shines a light on a failed approach towards affordable housing | Annia Ciezadlo,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/14/the-bronx-fire-shines-a-light-on-a-failed-approach-towards-affordable-housing
1/14/2022,"In 1986, Prince Andrew married Sarah Ferguson at Westminster Abbey to an avalanche of enthusiastic press coverage. Thirty-five years later, he faces a lawsuit for sexual assault from Virginia Giuffre, a woman who was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein. He is disgraced, stripped of his military titles, will no longer be officially “His Royal Highness”, nor represent the Queen. After yesterday’s summit with his mother at Windsor Castle, Andrew is no longer a working royal in any capacity and must, as the statement from Buckingham Palace made clear, face the lawsuit as a “private citizen”. Giuffre, a survivor of trafficking and abuse, has been courageous. Attacked and slandered by powerful individuals, she has continued to argue her case. She is, her team says, determined to have her day in court. The lawsuit may now go ahead as early as this autumn. In the year of the Platinum Jubilee, which was supposed to be all about celebrating the Queen and her long reign, the royal family are confronting the worrying possibility that attention will now be on the court case against Andrew.  The wedding of Prince Andrew was supposed to be the beginning of happy ever after for “Randy Andy”. And yet it wasn’t. By 1999, Andrew had become friendly with Jeffrey Epstein, who died before he could be put on trial. Andrew invited Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell to royal parties. When others swiftly distanced themselves from Epstein, who had been convicted of sex crimes in 2008, Andrew visited and stayed with him in New York. Giuffre, when she says she met Andrew in London in 2001, had Epstein snap a photo on her own camera, a photo that Andrew has claimed was doctored, even though other witnesses say they saw him with her in New York and at Epstein’s private island. Few royals have ever had to face the law. To look for a similar situation, we have to go back to Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, the future Edward VII. In 1868, Sir Charles Mordaunt accused his young wife Harriet of adultery with various men, and after finding letters from the prince, believed she had also had an affair with him. The prince had to give evidence to the subsequent divorce, declaring he had never been alone with Harriet, but appeared for only a few minutes and was not cross-examined by Sir Charles’s counsel. Fortunately for the prince, it was decided that Harriet was “insane” and should be put in an asylum – and could not be divorced. Lady Mordaunt was locked away. She was probably suffering from what we would now call postnatal depression. But even this case is not comparable: Lady Mordaunt was an adult. Giuffre was a minor when she alleges Andrew sexually assaulted her. She shows no sign of backing down, and the days when women could be locked away are over. From the catastrophic Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis, in which Andrew expressed no sympathy for the victims of Epstein, to arguments that delivering papers to his protection officers did not mean he had been served, Andrew’s public response to her allegations has been a vision of entitlement. Throughout the Newsnight interview, he claimed he didn’t know Epstein well, but was good friends with Maxwell, and Epstein came to his social occasions as her “plus one”. He invited Maxwell and Epstein to parties, including his daughter’s 18th and a party at Windsor Castle where the Queen was present; he is even accused of asking Maxwell to bring women to Buckingham Palace for him. After Maxwell’s conviction for sex trafficking, Andrew’s association with her is a serious problem. Since Judge Lewis Kaplan denied Andrew’s bid to throw out the sex abuse case, the damage limitation stories have emerged. One report suggests that Andrew will sell his chalet in Verbier, in the Swiss Alps, to fund legal fees and any settlement, instead of it being paid by his mother; other suggest he will settle out of court. Trying to encourage Giuffre to settle might have been easier had Andrew’s legal team not chosen to publish slurs against her – calling a victim of underage sexual abuse a “money-hungry sex kitten” in legal documents and accusing her of frivolous and inconsistent claims. And a settlement could run into the millions. There is a mortgage on the chalet, so Andrew needs to get more money from somewhere. Sources have explained that Giuffre would also expect an apology. So Andrew’s legal team, who have hardly endeared themselves to Giuffre, have the mother of all battles on their hands to persuade her to take a settlement. Even if she does, the taint will remain. But if she chooses to go to court instead, Andrew losing his military titles will be the least of his problems. A trial would be a disaster for Andrew and the royals. It would involve lengthy questioning, depositions, including possibly his former wife and daughters, and requests for evidence that has hitherto remained unfound, such as the records of Andrew’s protection officers for where he was the night when Virginia claims she met him. He could refuse to cooperate with the process, but the court would still judge in his absence. The comparison had been made by many that Prince Harry had relinquished his military titles when he stepped back to protect his wife and family – and many military sources had expressed sadness to lose him. Prince Harry had no lawsuits against him, no accusations. So, why was it that the royal dogged by controversy still retained all his accolades until now? Harry longed for a statement from the wider royal family backing up his concerns for his wife; Andrew was supported by the palace, which issued statements that “emphatically denied” the claims of Giuffre. But in a swift turnaround, Andrew is now out in the cold, no longer a member of “the Firm”. And if the case proceeds and the judge finds he was guilty of sexual assault of a minor, he will be found guilty not as a royal, but as a private citizen.

1/14/2022,"By a 6-3 vote, with liberal justices in dissent, the supreme court on Thursday blocked the Biden administration from enforcing a vaccine-or-testing mandate for large employers. (The court upheld a more modest mandate requiring vaccinations for healthcare workers who treat Medicare and Medicaid patients.) The employer mandate would have required workers to be vaccinated against the coronavirus or to wear masks and be tested weekly (neither employees nor employers were required to pay for the testing). It applied to employers with at least 100 employees. This would include more than 84 million workers, about two-thirds of the American workforce.  The administration estimated the rule would cause 22 million people to get vaccinated and prevent 250,000 hospitalizations. In its unsigned order blocking the rule – which had been devised by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha) – the court said that although the risks associated with coronavirus occur in many workplaces, “it is not an occupational hazard in most.” Hello? Not an occupational hazard? Since the outbreak of the pandemic, we’ve seen factories, wholesale distribution centers, meatpackers and hospitals become super-spreader centers. The Omicron variant is now ripping through America like wildfire, especially where people work in close contact. Before today’s ruling, a three-judge panel of the sixth US circuit court of appeals had decided that the Osha rule was “an important step in curtailing the transmission of a deadly virus that has killed over 800,000 people in the United States, brought our healthcare system to its knees, and cost hundreds of thousands of workers their jobs”. Judge Jane B Stranch, writing for the majority of the court of appeals, had noted that as “Covid-19 has continued to spread, mutate, kill and block the safe return of American workers to their jobs [and that] to protect workers, Osha can and must be able to respond to dangers as they evolve.” But today the supreme court disagreed – choosing instead to treat Covid like any “universal risk” of daily life that people voluntarily choose to accept. “Covid-19 can and does spread at home, in schools, during sporting events, and everywhere else that people gather. That kind of universal risk is no different from the day-to-day dangers that all face from crime, air pollution, or any number of communicable diseases,” the court said. This is absurd on its face. People have choices of where or whether to gather when it comes to social events, sporting events or travel. They can decide how much risk to take on from all sorts of day-to-day activities. The workplace is different. If they want a paycheck, most people must report to work. The whole purpose of Osha is to reduce health and safety risks at the workplace, precisely because when it comes to work most people have no choice. The supreme court concluded that permitting Osha to regulate here “would significantly expand Osha’s regulatory authority” without clear congressional authorization. Nonsense. Section 2 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 clearly states that “Congress declares it to be its purpose and policy … to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions [and] assure insofar as practicable that no employee will suffer diminished health, functional capacity, or life expectancy as a result of his work experience.” What’s really going on here? The Republican-appointed majority of the supreme court is intent on gutting the authority of regulatory agencies to interpret federal laws. Their target is the so-called “Chevron deference”, a 38-year-old precedent holding that courts should respect agency interpretations of laws enacted by Congress, even if Congress has not directly spoken to the precise issue at hand. Judicial deference is appropriate if the agency interpretation is reasonable. With Omicron infections and hospitalizations and deaths surging across America, Osha shouldn’t need Congress’s specific authorization to impose a vaccine-or-testing mandate at the workplace – at least according to supreme court precedent. By ruling otherwise, the supreme court’s conservative majority today signals it’s willing to strike down hundreds of regulations protecting the health and safety of Americas.

1/14/2022,"Of all the brilliant things that make one girl happy, music is the most important, especially her father’s vinyl record collection. In this new Abbey theatre production, a rich soundtrack of jazz and blues animates Andrea Ainsworth’s bare-bones staging of Duncan Macmillan and Jonny Donahoe’s play from 2013. Taking a candid and compassionate approach to the subject of suicidal depression, the writing manages to be both heartfelt and buoyant as it portrays a child’s experience of her mother’s suicide attempts. At the age of seven, the unnamed girl (Amy Conroy) hopes that by making a numbered list of “every brilliant thing” that makes life worth living, she can make her mother feel better. With no set, minimal props and only Carl Kennedy’s sound design to assist her, all eyes are on the irrepressible Conroy. It soon becomes clear that she will not be the solo performer: audience members have supporting roles throughout. As well as calling out items on her ever-expanding list of life’s joys – “ice cream” and “water fights” are important at the start – audience members are asked to play key characters in the girl’s story as she grows up. Co-creators to an extent, the audience nevertheless relies heavily on the improvisational gifts of Conroy, whose charm, warmth and spontaneity smooth over some of the script’s awkward transitions and tonal shifts.  As she moves from childish playfulness to the guilt she later carries for her mother’s suicide, the young woman keeps adding to her list. It becomes a form of diary, documenting what is important in her life at a particular moment, and helping her recover when she begins to lose her own mental equilibrium. While maintaining a light touch, in Conroy’s direct address to the audience the play comments on media responsibility when reporting suicide. Making a plea for kindness and mutual support that seems particularly timely, her character observes that most people will experience a form of depression at some point in their lives. Or as the closing song puts it, more insouciantly: “into each life some rain must fall”.

1/14/2022,"Bill Murray’s confirmation that he is to play an unnamed villain in the upcoming Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania isn’t the first time a prestigious star has deigned to join the weird world of Marvel. Glenn Close turned up as a space colony administrator in the Guardians of the Galaxy films, and Jeff Goldblum played the enthusiastically freaky Grandmaster in 2017’s Thor: Ragnarok. Cate Blanchett was the Norse God’s evil big sister in that movie, while Benicio del Toro appeared as the mysterious Collector in three films, culminating in 2018’s Avengers: Infinity War, where Thanos dispensed with him. Murray, the ageing doyen of indie cinema, has of course appeared in blockbusters before. Before becoming the kind of guy Wes Anderson and Sofia Coppola have on speed dial, he was king of 80s and 90s comedy, his leading turns in the original Ghostbusters and Groundhog Day perhaps even marking the commercial zenith of that period.  Then there was that awful point in the 00s when Murray agreed to voice the talking cat Garfield opposite Breckin Meyer and Jennifer Love Hewitt (remember them?) The movie was dross, and Murray said he thought he’d signed up for a Coen Brothers movie. (Garfield’s script had been written by Joel Cohen; Murray thought this was the same person as indie darling Joel Coen.) Why did Murray then agree to reprise the role of the curmudgeonly cat for 2006’s Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties? We have not been told. The point is, Murray isn’t averse to acting in commercially aligned movies. But he famously has no agent, manager, or contactable phone number; booking him is like trying to get hold of the A-Team. Yet it still seems strange that Murray is about to turn up in a Marvel movie, let alone one as fantastical as Quantumania, which will delve into the quantum realm seen briefly in previous Ant-Man episodes. The film’s main baddie will be Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror, described as a “time-travelling, multiversal adversary”. Who will Murray play? His wise-cracking sidekick? It makes little sense. Except, of course, that Murray is also the perfect Marvel villain, because this film series hasn’t taken itself seriously for years. The now-tainted Joss Whedon crystallised the self-effacing, self-reflexive approach to comic book film-making that has become the template for just about everything when he had Robert Downey Jr’s Iron Man describe his first meeting with Chris Hemsworth’s ornately robed Thor (in 2012’s The Avengers) as a bit like “Shakespeare in the park”. Ever since then, it has been open season on all the comic book genre’s most ridiculous conceits, from its obsession with villains of Asian extraction in Iron Man 3 to the Tobey Maguire version of Spider-Man’s icky organic webshooters in the recent No Way Home. In that sense, then, Murray is where he ought to be. In the interview in which he discussed his new part, the actor described his role in the new film as “being a bad guy”.

1/14/2022,"It’s the sheer randomness that grinds you down. On Christmas Day, my wife and I were – fingers crossed – congratulating ourselves on everything having gone according to plan. Our daughter, Anna, and her husband, Robert, had managed to avoid the Omicron variant in the US – both were triple-vaxxed – and been able to fly over to the UK; and our son, Robbie, and his girlfriend, Laila, had also managed to get their boosters, escape Covid, and come up from Brighton to stay with us. So we had been together as a family for the first time in more than two years.  On Boxing Day, Anna woke up with a sore throat and a headache. She took a lateral flow test that came back clear so we all hung out together. The following morning she still felt ropey but the LFT again came back negative so she and Robert went off to visit friends while Robbie and Laila went back home. It wasn’t until the morning of 28 December that she got the dreaded two red lines and went into isolation. At which point the rest of us assumed we were bound to get Covid. Only we never did. At least not then. Laila got Covid five days into the new year and Robert tested positive last night, a while after he and Anna were back in Minneapolis. Robbie got Covid today. For the second time. Which just left Jill and me to get the virus. Neither of us has a clue why we have escaped so far. Whether we have had it without knowing – unlikely over Christmas as we had both taken regular LFTs, are immune, or just incredibly lucky. Probably just lucky. We try to take each day as it comes and go out as planned but it’s mentally exhausting being in a permanent state of preparedness to get ill. When I took over as this paper’s political sketch writer eight years ago, my biggest worry was whether I would ever be able to fill the void left by my predecessor, Simon Hoggart, who died in January 2014. Simon was a brilliantly sharp and witty writer who had been making fun of politicians for more than 20 years and he was a desperately tough act to follow. I remember being acutely depressed for much of the first year when reading the below-the-line comments on the sketch and the verdict was often “Crace is no Hoggart”. But one decision I made early on was to retire the ever absurd Tory MP Michael Fabricant from the sketch. Fabricant – or Micky Fab of the glorious Talking Hair – had for a long while been one of Simon’s personal favourites and it seemed a fitting tribute to discontinue his appearances in print. It was a decision that had an unexpected coda. After a year or so of sketching, I was tapped on the shoulder by an MP. “Are you John Crace?” he asked. I confirmed I was. “Good,” he continued. “Michael Fabricant is very worried. He wants to know when he will next be in the sketch.” “Never,” I replied. Mmm, the MP muttered. Michael is going to be very disappointed. It was then I realised the extent of the vanity of some MPs. They would rather be ridiculed than ignored. Only I haven’t been able to keep to my word, because today Fabricant did something so ludicrous I couldn’t ignore him any longer. While every other Tory MP was trying to steer away from the airwaves for fear of being asked to defend Boris Johnson’s party lifestyle, Michael F, actively volunteered. First off, he declared it wasn’t a party but a group of workmates appearing to have a party: then he followed up by saying they deserved to break the rules as they had been working so hard. Unlike doctors and nurses … It was quite the stupidest take imaginable and deserved a paragraph in the sketch. That one, Simon, was for you. After lying low for a couple of days, Boris Johnson was forced out in to the open to appear at prime minister’s questions and was finally obliged to provide an explanation for why he attended the Downing Street party on 20 May 2020. First he gave a half-hearted, insincere apology for any wrongdoing people may have perceived him to make. Not for the breaches of the law and the lying to both parliament and the country. Then he got to the details of the party. Or rather the party that was not a party. What we were asked to believe was that Johnson was one of the stupidest men alive, and had failed to notice he had been at a party until alerted to it by a leak to the press more than 18 months later. Here was the chronology. He definitely hadn’t authorised or read the email inviting everyone at No 10 to the party – why would he bother with anything sent by his principal private secretary? – and the “we” in the invitation in no way suggested it might have come from the prime minister. Then, completely coincidentally, he had wandered downstairs to where the party was being held. Once there he had done a double-take and just assumed it was a “work event”. After all it was completely normal to find trestle tables in the garden stacked with sausage rolls and booze and people getting pissed at work events. That his wife had also been there with two friends had only reinforced his impression it was a work event. As had the complaints from some admin staff the next day at having to clear up the empties from the flowerbeds. Alarmingly, his cabinet – with the exception of Rishi Sunak – are just as dim as they appeared quite comfortable with such obvious bollocks. No 10 was a special case, they said, because it was both a home and an office. Well, so is my mum’s care home and no one had a party there. If one definition of insanity is doing the same things over and over again and expecting a different result, I’m clearly not mad. Or I’m a special kind of mad. Because this season every time I’ve gone to see Spurs, I’ve had a good idea of exactly what type of game I’m going to see, but have gone along anyway. Last week’s and yesterday’s two-leg semi-final against Chelsea in the Carabao Cup are a case in point. I knew that Tottenham were going to be outclassed and that the only real variable was how much they were going to lose by, yet there was a grim sense of satisfaction in seeing my worst fears realised and enduring the pain of yet another clueless performance. I still can’t quite understand, though, how Spurs have become quite so bad so quickly. We may not have won anything, though we did get to a Champion’s League final, but a few years ago we were playing attractive football which was good to watch. Even when we lost, we would give most teams a good game. Now, though, despite three changes of manager – or possibly because – we are a team that struggles against League One opposition. Our wing backs can’t cross the ball: they either scuff it to a defender or kick it over the bar. Our defenders barely recognise each other, our midfield can’t control the ball, let alone pass it, and no one is more surprised than our attack if they score. Every player we have bought has turned out to be a disappointment, worse than the footballer they were lined up to replace. It’s as if all Spurs can manage at the moment is to turn good players into mediocre ones. What’s more, it’s even getting to Matthew with whom I go to almost all games. On Wednesday I was begging him to let us leave 10 minutes before the end as Spurs needed three goals to take the game to penalties. Matthew refused – he’s old school and never leaves before the final whistle – though he did say we could skip clapping the players off the pitch. A huge moment for him. We will be going to the north London derby together on Sunday against Arsenal, and I have every confidence Spurs will let me down again. I will report back. I’m fairly sure that if I were to wake up in a hospital in the Australian outback after a major car crash with total memory loss, my first instinct wouldn’t be to discharge myself the moment I could almost walk again. I’m guessing I’d be more worried about who I was, what I was doing in the middle of nowhere, and how the hell I was going to find my way round an alien environment of which I had no recollection. I might also wonder how I was going to get by without any money or car. Assuming I remembered what money and a car were. Then if I’d been the leading amnesiac character – the Man – played by Jamie Dornan in The Tourist, the BBC’s six-part thriller, and done the sensible thing by staying put, I’d have been topped in by a 6ft6 Texan in cowboy hat and boots who had turned up at the hospital looking for me moments after the Man thought to leave. There again, the Man wasn’t the only person with amnesia. No one at the hospital seemed to notice he was speaking with an Irish accent when everyone else – except the huge American – was Australian. Something they could have used to try to identify him. Nor did the police bother to investigate the tyre tracks in the dust and the wreckage on the road from where the monster truck had sideswiped the Man’s car. And these were just some of the inconsistencies in the first episode. But none of them spoiled the enjoyment. Harry and Jack Williams seem to have had a field day writing the scripts: almost as if they had a bet to think up ever more outrageous and shocking scenarios and only afterwards tried to work out how to shoehorn them into the plot line. It’s all done with a light touch and is effortlessly gripping. We binged the whole thing inside a week and I doubt we’ll watch a better thriller all year. The trick is to follow the example of the Man and not ask too many questions. Digested week, digested: The parties that weren’t parties.

1/14/2022,"Good morning. Prince Andrew has been completely removed from official royal life after the Queen stripped him of his military affiliations and royal patronages amid his ongoing sexual assault case.  Intended to distance the monarchy from the Duke of York, the dramatic move means he will no longer use the His Royal Highness royal style in any official capacity. Buckingham Palace said in a statement on Thursday: “With the Queen’s approval and agreement, the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages have been returned to the Queen. The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen.” Virginia Giuffre, now 38, says she was forced into sex at 17 with the duke by his associates Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, and has brought a civil lawsuit against Andrew. He denies the allegations. How will the civil case affect the monarchy? Norman Baker, a commentator on royal matters, said the royal family “could not escape the immense damage” the case would bring. The move came hours after more than 150 military veterans wrote to the Queen describing Andrew’s position as “untenable” and asking her to remove his honorary military roles. The senators Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin have thwarted Joe Biden’s efforts to to push voting rights legislation through Congress. The president was reportedly in last-ditch talks with the centrist Democrats on Thursday night after Sinema of Arizona said she would not support any changes to filibuster rules. Manchin of West Virginia, praised Sinema and released his own statement confirming he would not do so either. Sinema and Manchin’s rebellion comes at a time of deep concern for US democracy. Republican lawmakers in 19 states have enacted 34 new laws that impose new voting restrictions. Why did Sinema not support changing the rules? The senator said that she “will not support separate actions that worsen the underlying disease of division infecting our country”. Why does it matter? As no Republicans support the voting rights bills or changing filibuster rules, Democrats cannot progress unless Sinema and Manchin vote with them. The supreme court has blocked the Biden administration from enforcing a requirement for unvaccinated employees at large businesses to test weekly and wear a mask at work. The court’s conservative majority opposed the rule, but allowed the imposition of a vaccine mandate for most US healthcare workers. The mandate applies to healthcare providers that receive federal Medicare or Medicaid funding, which could affect 76,000 health care facilities and home health care providers. More than 80 million people would have been affected by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s vaccine-or-test rule for businesses with at least 100 employees. What did the supreme court argue? The conservative majority ruled that the administration overstepped its authority in its attempt to impose the requirement. … and the dissenting liberals? The three judges argued the court was the one overreaching by overruling health experts in its judgement. Novak Djokovic’s Australian visa has been cancelled again just days before the start of the Australian Open. The move by the Australian immigration minister will likely mean Djokovic is deported and unable to play in the tournament. The House select committee has subpoenaed Twitter, Meta, Alphabet and Reddit for records related to the Capitol attack. the congressman Bennie Thompson said previous requests for cooperation had been ignored. The Republican party has indicated that it intends to withdraw from US presidential debates, following claims that they are biased against it. The New York Times first reported that the Republican National Committee had sent a letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates on Thursday. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, faces renewed calls for his resignation after further allegations of parties on the eve of Prince Philip’s socially distanced funeral. At the time, outdoor gatherings were limited to six people or two households. The pandemic has exacerbated a stark wealth division in Asia: while 140 million people fell into poverty after losing their livelihoods, Covid created 20 new ‘pandemic billionaires’, according to a report by Oxfam. The new billionaires profited from the international response to the crisis, selling pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and services. Big Thief are the exception to the rule: everything that makes them work “could be the undoing of any other band”, writes Marissa R Moss. Frontperson Adrianne Lenker and guitarist Buck Meek are divorced, bassist Max Oleartchik lives in a different country, and the group’s members have separate musical side projects. The “alchemy” of these elements is “what makes Big Thief Big Thief in the first place”, Meek tells Moss in this piece about what makes the band tick, pain and why recording is like sex. French bakers have accused a large supermarket chain offering below-inflation prices for baguettes of “demagogy”. The Leclerc group vowed on Tuesday to cut into its profit margins to cap the cost of the signature French loaf at 29 euro cents (24p), leading bakers, farmers and millers to accuse it of “launching a campaign that destroys values”.

1/14/2022,"The US government’s tyrannical reign over a classic condiment is finally ending. For more than 70 years, the Food and Drug Administration has insisted on certain standards for French dressing, even as the condiment has been derided by food snobs and fallen out of favor with the American palate.  The dressing, essentially a vinaigrette with ketchup and other flavors, has been called too sweet, too coarse, and not French enough, as the food writer Charles Perry pointed out in a 2000 essay defending the stuff. In a 2017 survey of favorite American condiments, French dressing hardly got a mention; ranch was the clear winner, the New York Times noted. But things are changing for the beleaguered condiment, thanks to a longstanding effort by concerned citizens at the Association for Dressings and Sauces (ADS), an industry group that is demanding an end to the FDA’s salad-dressing surveillance. The FDA maintains “standards of identity” for foods to ensure they meet consumers’ expectations and manufacturers aren’t misleading shoppers – they are “kind of like a recipe”, said Diana Winters, deputy director of the Resnick Center for Food Law at the University of California, Los Angeles. Perhaps authorities got wind of devious behavior involving French dressing, because in 1950, the FDA issued rules saying the dressing must contain at least 35% vegetable oil, along with certain “acidifying ingredients” such as vinegar and citric acid. Salt, sugar, tomato paste, and “harmless seasoning or flavoring” can also be added, according to the Federal Register, the government’s journal. Over the decades, various changes were made to the standards. But “because it’s still on the books, manufacturers who are making anything they call French dressing had to follow that exact prescription”, Winters said. Until, that is, the Association for Dressings and Sauces swooped in. It argued that there were many similar toppings – ranch and Italian, for instance – that weren’t subject to such rules. French dressing “no longer serves as a benchmark for other dressings”, the FDA cited the ADS petition as saying, and the standards served to “restrict innovation”. Today, the @US_FDA revoked the standard of identity for #frenchdressing because it is ... gasp ... outdated. https://t.co/IvepI2kcdf pic.twitter.com/QVyFOT4pZo “The association said other dressings don’t have this and the public doesn’t need this,” Winters said. “The reason to issue a standard of identity is to protect the public, basically, and say look, if you’re buying this, you know exactly what you’re getting.” But the industry group argued “the public knows what French dressing is and if a manufacturer wants to use a different or innovative ingredient or do something like bring down the fat content, they should be able to,” Winters said. It appears not to have been a priority for officials: it took 22 years for the FDA to recommend a change. In late 2020, the FDA signaled it agreed with ADS. Its final rule was published on Thursday and will take effect in 30 days. So what does this mean for enthusiasts – those who, like Perry, understand the “American taste for a big, mouth-filling sauce full of sweet, sour, spicy and aromatic flavors on a rich, long-cooked tomato base”? Could Americans’ newfound freedom to engage in French dressing innovation bring about a renaissance? Probably not. If people are “going to buy a French dressing, it will still be French dressing as they expect it to be,” Winters said. “I don’t expect anything to change in the salad dressing aisle.”",Lifestyle/Food,Long-derided French dressing freed from strict US rules,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jan/14/french-dressing-fda-rules
1/14/2022,"They came from countries in west Africa, nearly all of them from the Gambia, and settled in Twin Parks Towers Northeast, a 19-story apartment building full of working-class families from the region and Latin America.  Some of them were born here to parents from the Gambia, volunteering in local community groups, attending local mosques, enrolling in local schools and colleges hoping for a future in social work, economics and justice. Those dreams came to an end on Sunday, 9 January, when a fire broke out in the residential tower killing 17 people, including several members of two families. Fire department officials said a malfunctioning electric space heater was to blame. The rapid spread of smoke through two doors left open – despite a law requiring they spring closed – claimed most of the victims’ brief lives. Eight were children; the youngest was two years old. One had celebrated his 12th birthday the day before the deadly fire. Police officials identified the victims of the fire on Tuesday. These are their stories. Loved ones described Janneh as a devoted sister and friend – a cheerleader to those around her and “a good person to be around”, her sister Mareama told the New York Times. Janneh was a psychology major at Lehman College and wanted to be a social worker, her sister told the Times. She added that Sera was an active member of the Gambian Youth Organization, a community group located steps from Twin Parks that serves the neighborhood and the borough’s west African communities at large. Janneh collapsed while trying to escape their sixth-floor apartment. She is survived by her parents and three siblings, including the youngest, Aisha, who is still in the hospital battling injuries from the fire, the Janneh family wrote in a GoFundMe post. “She was a nice woman,” her father told the Daily Mail. “She was very caring, helping – she listened to us.” Toure was an eighth-grade student at the Angelo Patri middle school, located next door to Twin Parks. His classmate and friend of three years Chanel Álvarez, 13, described him as “a bit of a troublemaker, but a very good kid” at a nighttime vigil in front of the fire-damaged building on Tuesday. That afternoon, more than two dozen students, along with teachers and school staff, walked out in front of Twin Parks to pay tribute to their classmate, wearing laminated badges with his picture, and lighting candles at a makeshift memorial for Toure. “I loved him dearly,” the school’s principal, Angel Ortega, told the New York Times. “He always had that smile.” Mahamadou was one of at least four siblings caught in the 9 January blaze, according to an online fundraising page set up by her aunt, Khadidja Timbaye, for the family. Two other Mahamadou children were treated in critical condition, Timbaye wrote. Haji Dukuray, 49; Haja Dukureh, 37; Mustapha Dukureh, 12; Mariam Dukureh, 11; Fatoumata Dukureh, five Haja Dukureh, 37, and her husband, Haji Dukuray, 49, moved from the Gambia more than a decade ago, settling in the Bronx, according to Fatoumata Dukureh, Haja’s aunt. They had three children in the United States: Mustapha, 12; Mariam, 11; and Fatoumata, five, who shares a name with her mother’s aunt. The couple worked hard to support their children – Haja as a home health aide and Haji at a local Kentucky Fried Chicken, said Fatoumata. They regularly sent money back to relatives in the Gambia. The Dukurehs lived in an apartment on the 19th floor of the ill-fated building on 181st Street, joining an enclave of west African immigrants. “This is a very close-knit community. We are predominantly from one town in the Gambia called Alunghare, so we are all family,” said Haji Dukureh, Haja’s uncle, speaking with ABC News. The family was devoutly Muslim, and Haji frequented a nearby mosque to pray in the mornings. They celebrated Ramadan with the Gambian-style chicken and jollof rice, prepared by Haja and eaten at night, when Muslims break their fast during the holy month. The children displayed distinct personalities, said Fatoumata, Haja’s aunt. “Mustapha was very smart. He would always read and help others with reading … Mariam was very sweet. She looked like her mom and was always helping her mom.” The younger Fatoumata had just celebrated a birthday. She was quiet and shy like her dad, family told the City. The Dukurehs perished attempting to escape the building when it filled with smoke, relative Hawa Dukuray told the New York Times. “I’m heartbroken,” she said. Fatoumata Drammeh, 50; Fatoumala Drammeh, 21; Nyumaaisha Drammeh, 19; Muhammed Drammeh, 12 Fatoumata Drammeh, 50, and her husband, Ishak Drammeh, 57, moved to Twin Parks from the Gambia and lived on the 15th floor for nearly 20 years. Fatoumata and three of the couple’s children, Fatoumala, 21; Nyumaaisha, 19; and Muhammed, 12, were killed in the fire. They are survived by Ishak and their daughter Fatima, 23, and another son, Yagub, 16, who remains in critical condition. Ishak was out of town on business when the fire broke out on Sunday and the rest of the family had celebrated Muhammed’s 12th birthday the day before, at an indoor trampoline park in Queens, the New York Times reported. Nyumaaisha, who went by Aisha, was set to begin college next month. Her cousin Fatma Barow, 46, said in an interview on Monday that she wanted to become a lawyer. “Aisha wanted to help others, I said, ‘OK, I will pray for you,’” Barow said. “She was a beautiful soul. God, so lovely.” Fatoumala was set to graduate from the University of Buffalo soon and studied political science. A statement from the university issued on Wednesday said she was an active member of the school’s Educational Opportunity Program. She was also the vice-president of Powerful United Ladies Striving for Excellence – or Pulse – an on-campus networking group for women of color, said Brian F Hamluk, the university’s vice president of Student Life. “She was a very good girl,” Ishak, her father, told the New York Times. “Muhammad was a good boy, too. Nyumaaisha was a good girl.” Tawana Davis, a nextdoor neighbor of the Drammehs, said she saw the family grow up and settle into life in the US. “They lived here basically the whole time I lived here. I saw those kids as babies. I taught [Ishak and Fatoumata] to speak English,” she said, adding that Muhammed and her grandson were friends. “Everyone on the floor, we were like family.” “They are a very nice family, very well respected,” she said. “They were just the best people.” A mother of five, Fatoumata “Chakou” Tunkara, 43, was visiting a friend inside of the Fordham Heights apartment along with her six-year-old son, Omar Jambang, when the fire broke out, killing the pair, according to the Daily News. Native to Soma, the Gambia, a town roughly five miles south of the Gambia River, Tunkara’s family is raising funds to send her and her son’s remains to their homeland, a family member wrote in a GoFundMe. Hagi Jawara worked jobs in construction and at a fried chicken restaurant, and his wife, Isatou Jabbie, was a home health aide, his brother Yusupha told the New York Post. The Gambian couple are survived by their four children, ages six to 15, who were visiting relatives in the west African country at the time of the fire, the New York Post reported. They were set to reunite with their parents at the end of the month. Yusupha described his brother as “jovial”. “He was always smiling and laughing with everyone, never had a disagreement with anybody,” he told the Post. The youngest of the fire’s victims, Ousmane Konteh, was staying at a relative’s apartment on the 19th floor when the smoke engulfed the Bronx building Sunday, a family member posted on GoFundMe. The toddler was being cared for by a relative while his mom went to work. He is survived by his mother, Fatoumata Sankanu, and three siblings.

1/14/2022,"As the Omicron variant rips through the US, states in the south continue to report record case numbers amid serious concern around hospital staff shortages. In Mississippi, officials warned this week the hospital system was on the verge of crisis due to staff shortages as local media reported most hospitals in the state were at or had reached capacity during the Omicron surge.  The state already faces a chronic nursing shortage, exacerbated by the pandemic, with approximately 3,000 positions vacant, according to a survey by the Mississippi Hospital Association. Around a third of the state’s hospital nurses have left for other jobs, according to the research, many of them to better paying positions out of state. Last week Mississippi recorded its highest seven day average of new Covid cases, 7,185, since the pandemic began, according to state health department data. As of Thursday the number of people hospitalized with Covid in the state had risen to 1,332 people. Health department data showed that 90% of Covid deaths for the period between 16 December 2021 and 12 January 2022 had been among unvaccinated people. “The game has changed since the Delta wave,” said Dr Alan Jones, chancellor of clinical affairs at University of Mississippi Medical Center, the state’s largest hospital, during a Tuesday press conference reported by Mississippi Today. Jones continued: “The challenges we are facing are really around staffing. Compounding that is that this is a much more infectious variant, taking more staff out that we have in the workforce.” Covid vaccination rates in Mississippi remain among the lowest in the country and well below the national average, with just 49% of the population fully vaccinated. In neighboring Tennessee hospital officials also issued cautions over staff shortages due to infection with the now dominant Omicron variant. In Nashville, one of the city’s largest hospitals was being forced to reassign specialist staff to cope with the Omicron surge. As of Tuesday, Tennessee hit its peak Covid positive seven day average of 14,345 new cases, according to CDC data. “We have tons of employees that have Omicron Covid,” said Dr Todd Rice, associate professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, in an interview with local radio. “They may not be that sick, but they are infected. So, they are quarantined at home and not eligible to work.” Rice added: “One of our biggest problems is just finding employees to take care of patients because we have so many employees that are out sick.” State health officials in Louisiana on Wednesday reported 17,592 new cases of Covid-19 the highest number of new cases since the pandemic began and the fourth time since the end of December the state had set a new record. On the same day, the city of New Orleans reintroduced a mask mandate amid the soaring cases. The move stood in contrast to other major cities in the state that have so far opted against new mask mandates during the latest surge. Earlier in the week, staff at one of New Orleans major hospital systems voiced similar concerns around major staff shortages due to illness. The state’s Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards, on Thursday issued a warning about rising hospitalizations as officials noted the Omicron surge in the state had not reached its peak. “We know that the more people that end up in the hospital, the tougher things are going to be for our state,” Edwards said during a press conference. “The hospitals are trying to deliver care for anyone who needs care, not just for Covid patients.” Of the 2,081 people hospitalized with Covid in Louisiana, about 75% were not fully vaccinated, according to the state health department; 51% of the eligible population are vaccinated in the state, according to CDC data. In Alabama, on Tuesday, the state reported a record number of children hospitalized with coronavirus due to the highly transmissible variant. At least 60 children had been hospitalized with 13 receiving treatment in intensive care. The state has also recorded a number of record case highs throughout January as officials continue to urge all those eligible to receive the Covid vaccine. State health officials told the Montgomery Advertiser they were “extremely concerned” about the rise of hospitalizations among children and parents to get their children inoculated. Some school systems in Alabama were also temporarily moving back to remote learning as a result of the continuing surge. Vaccination rates in Alabama also remain low, with just 48% of the population fully vaccinated.",News/World news,Southern US hospitals grapple with staff shortages amid record Covid cases,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/southern-us-hospitals-staff-shortages-record-covid-cases
1/14/2022,"This month, How to Eat – the series exploring the best way to enjoy Britain’s favourite foods – must start by making a full and frank public apology. In 2013, HTE declared that (trigger warning: rank stupidity) cookies were: “Big, brash US interlopers – oversweet, over here and utterly dysfunctional.” HTE would like to sincerely apologise for what it now realises was an inflammatory and offensive attack, not just on American food, but on everyone with taste buds. That sentence does not represent the column that How to Eat now is and it hopes to move on from this uncharacteristic misstep.  While not seeking to excuse such kneejerk anti-Americanism, HTE would urge you to remember that the early 10s were – the country then drowning in a sweet-’n’-greasy wave of US-inspired “dude food” – a very stressful time in British food writing. It seemed every dish would soon include a Man v Food mountain of pulled pork and bacon jam, washed down with a freakshake. HTE was lashing out at boorish excess. Cookies got caught in the crossfire. It didn’t help that, back then, HTE’s cookie experience was largely limited to pretty mundane, mass-produced versions. Now many serious bakers are making astonishing cookies, and HTE has been haunted by its offhand dismissal every time it eats one. In fact, it now accepts the British biscuit – diminutive, dry, one-dimensional, chocolate-deficient – is pretty drab compared with an XL cookie’s rococo complexity. Biscuits are black and white TV. The cookie is Imax. Sure, they can get over elaborate. Some cookies literally crumble under the weight of their own outrageous ambition. But How to Eat is converted. Consider these words its marshmallow-topped mea culpa*. *Only minus the marshmallow. HTE hasn’t totally lost it. Yet. Defining our terms … is necessary because, both in the US and Britain (where any chocolate chip biscuit presumptuously calls itself a cookie), the term is fuzzy. To clarify, a cookie should be around 10cm in diameter and a good 1cm+ deep at its chunkiest. Befitting its name – derived from koekje, meaning ‘little cake’ in Dutch – the cookie should also be generously packed with ingredients. Imagine a glittering geological seam hiding nuggets of nutty gold, sweet pockets of dried fruit and underground reservoirs of (semi-molten) chocolate. A good cookie will also be incredibly buttery (not so much rich in fat as obscenely wealthy), lightly crisped at its edges and yet moist, gooey and chewy in its interior. It should be dense but pliable. Where British biscuits are brittle and arid, crumbs held together by stiff upper-lip determination, the cookie is relaxed, self-confident and flexible. How to achieve those cake-adjacent textures, clear flavours and layers of caramelised depth in your cookie is hotly contested. As J Kenji López-Alt has written for Serious Eats: “Cookies are fickle and the advice out there is conflicting.” However, there is loose consensus over the wisdom of using, variously: some brown sugar (inherently moist and helps trap moisture); egg yolks over whites; bread flour to create more elastic gluten strands; and browned butter, which you can try melting before adding to your dough. Which should be chilled overnight. Or not. The debate rolls on … Ingredient distribution A cookie is not a pizza. It is not a platform. A little drizzled sauce or, if safely secured, flecks of chocolate or nut are acceptable on top. But most of the cookie’s flavourings should be buried inside. Otherwise, sticky with caramel, loosely festooned with everything from Smarties to granola or teetering with marshmallows, the cookie – its surface somewhere between a rocky, inhospitable planet and a studded leather face mask – can become difficult to handle and eat. Good things to put in cookies Quality chocolate in varieties dark to milk: not pre-packaged chips but exciting, unevenly chopped chunks. Other hazelnut chocolate spreads are available, but Nutella. (Salted) caramel sauce. Raisins, sultanas, dates, glacé morello cherries. Peanut butter. Fudge. Lotus Biscoff sauce. Stem ginger, used with restraint. Nuts soft enough that, used in small quantities (whole, flaked or crushed pecans, cashews, walnuts, pistachios etc), will add a complementary accent to your cookie rather than, as too many nuts will, turning it into an earthy, worthy mouthful. The above are mutually sympathetic ingredients from a broadly similar flavour palette, which will benefit from some arresting contrast, modulation or inversion. Flaked sea salt intensifies flavours in a bracing way, while dried cranberries, citrus zest or even roasted rhubarb offer tart punctuation. Any more than three flavours is confusing overkill. Bad things to put in cookies Marshmallows. It’s like hitting an edible airbag full of cotton wool. All but the tiniest amount of honey for depth. In any greater quantity this floral bully imposes a one-note flavour on all foods. White chocolate: the devil’s work. Mint chocolate, that perennially unwelcome chocolate-toothpaste hybrid. Alcohol, the ruination of many desserts. Mixed spices on a cinnamon-nutmeg tip. Christmas is over, thankfully. Nougat: culinary plasticine. Hazelnuts, peanuts and whole almonds? All too hard. Proprietary sweet brands which, from Maltesers to Rolo, are designed as self-contained snacks. They were never meant to be embedded in cookies where they create textural clashes (eg Twix or KitKat pieces forming dry patches of double or triple-layered biscuit overload). Dried apple, apricot or banana: who are we trying to kid, here? There are no redeeming nutritional benefits to the cookie. When Nauseating before 9am, the cookie is not breakfast. It is not a meal at any time. It is a snack. A de facto elevenses or afternoon tea item, enjoyed with a bucket of tea on gloomy afternoons that need a boost. Otherwise, it is an evening dessert. Process and equipment A biscuit might be eaten over the sink, your cupped hand or rushing around trailing crumbs like Hansel and Gretel. The cookie, far richer and sickly if wolfed, should be lingered over – breaking pieces off over a five-to-20 minute period – and, preferably, eaten off a plate. This is not a matter of cleanliness per se. Your cookie will create a lot of debris which you want contained in one place, to later collect with a wet finger. That final sweep of cookie crumbs is one of this snack’s most pleasurable phases. Dunking You dunk biscuits because they are too dry. A cookie does not need moistening. On the contrary, if you dunk a cookie (high fat content, soluble embedded pieces), it quickly becomes structurally unstable and oddly gluey – a thick indefinite sludge rather than a shiny theme-park of edible attractions. Some suggest the solution is to dunk cookies in cold milk which HTE will not entertain because a) it is not a small child, b) milk does nothing to transform the flavour of the cookie and c) due to the friable nature of the cookie, bits of it are still liable to fall off into your milk. Plus, who drinks milk for fun? Ice-cream Frequent partners, often to each other’s detriment. In particular, the addition of cookie dough to ice-cream (claggy, gritty, provocatively sweet), is one of modern food’s many revolting quirks. A little crumbled cookie is OK as an ice-cream topping. But sticking a whole cookie in there, like a wafer, is too much of too many good things which, beyond sugar content, have little natural affinity. For example, any chocolate in your cookie will be unable to melt smoothly in ice-cream’s sub-zero clutch. It will taste like gravel. For engineering reasons, it is also wise to avoid using cookies to create ice-cream sandwiches. Sandwiching soft ice-cream between stiff biscuit in a way that is convenient and pleasurable – the sandwich must maintain its structural integrity but the cookie must be softly yielding – requires a degree of food science knowhow way beyond most home cooks and pro chefs. The Maxibon is a stroke of genius (see also: its spiritual US cousin, Chipwich), but most DIY cookie sandwiches are disastrous. If you must sandwich something between two cookies, make it something adhesive (jam, Nutella, dulce de leche), rather than something that will frequently burst free in comedic squirts (ice-cream, whipped cream, mascarpone). Drink Tea! Tea! Tea! Strong tea, tannic and iron in its strength. Black coffee (not creamy white) may offer a bitter contrast to your cookie, but it lacks tea’s thirst-slaking, palate-cleansing powers of refreshment. Tea is the obvious reset button when dealing with super-sweet, fat-loaded cookies.

1/14/2022,"A total of 270 US doctors, scientists, healthcare professionals and professors have written an open letter to streaming company Spotify, expressing concern about medical misinformation on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, listed as the platform’s most popular program. The letter also asks the platform to “establish a clear and public policy to moderate misinformation on its platform”.  It accuses controversial host Joe Rogan’s show of having a “concerning history of broadcasting misinformation, particularly regarding the Covid-19 pandemic”. The letter was first reported by Rolling Stone, which quoted Katrine Wallace, an epidemiologist at University of Illinois Chicago school of public health, calling Rogan “a menace to public health” for airing anti-vaccine ideology. And, specifically, the letter calls out a highly controversial episode of the podcast from last December that features Robert Malone, a virologist who was involved in the mRNA vaccine technology that led to some of the leading Covid-19 vaccines but has since been criticized for spreading vaccine misinformation. The episode has been widely criticized for promoting baseless conspiracy theories. “Dr Malone used the JRE platform to promote numerous baseless claims, including several falsehoods about Covid-19 vaccines and an unfounded theory that societal leaders have ‘hypnotized’ the public. Many of these statements have already been discredited,” the letter said. In the episode, Malone espoused multiple baseless beliefs, including “mass formation psychosis” being responsible for people’s belief in vaccine efficacy, as well as the false claim that hospitals are financially incentivized to falsely diagnose deaths as having been caused by Covid-19. Rogan said on air: “There’s all these rumors that you would hear about what a hospital gets paid per Covid death and that the government gives them money and that they’re incentivized”, to which Malone replied: “It’s not rumors” and continued with further misinformation on the topic. The experts’ letter countered that: “Mass-misinformation events of this scale have extraordinarily dangerous ramifications.” It continued: “As scientists, we face backlash and resistance as the public grows to distrust our research and expertise. As educators and science communicators, we are tasked with repairing the public’s damaged understanding of science and medicine. As physicians, we bear the arduous weight of a pandemic that has stretched our medical systems to their limits and only stands to be exacerbated by the anti-vaccination sentiment woven into this and other episodes of Rogan’s podcast.” The letter further asserts that Malone is “one of two recent JRE guests who has compared pandemic policies to the Holocaust. These actions are not only objectionable and offensive, but also medically and culturally dangerous.” Rogan, who has been described by the New York Times as “one of the most consumed media products on the planet”, has legions of devoted followers but throughout the pandemic has repeatedly spread misleading and false claims. The letter concluded: “This is not only a scientific or medical concern; it is a sociological issue of devastating proportions and Spotify is responsible for allowing this activity to thrive on its platform.”",News/Technology,‘Menace to public health’: 270 doctors call out Spotify over Joe Rogan’s podcast,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/14/spotify-joe-rogan-podcast-open-letter
1/14/2022,"What counts as an affair?An affair is significant contact outside the committed partnership. That may be oral sex in the photocopier room. It may equally be a secret correspondence, an inappropriate “friendship”, or a bit of sly webcam action. But in all instances, it will involve a breach of trust, says Noel Bell, psychotherapist and spokesperson for the UK Council for Psychotherapy. “Cheating is where you go beyond the confines of what was agreed between two people,” he says. “Even within polyamorous relationships, there can still be the concept of cheating.”  The trouble is, in most relationships (and certainly in most monogamous relationships) there is no formal agreement governing, say, whether it’s OK to put a devil-face emoji in an email to an attractive colleague; nor whether it’s acceptable to read your partner’s work emails. Expectations of behaviour vary from one relationship to another and also within a relationship. In all cases, however, trust is the key word. If you want to survive an affair, all efforts should go towards repairing that trust. My partner has had an affair; is this the end?Not if you don’t want it to be. In fact, none of the counsellors and therapists I speak to feel that the affair deserves the tabloid-headline status it has acquired in our judgmental age. Which isn’t to say that the discovery of infidelity doesn’t really hurt – especially the sustained, secret affairs that cause one partner to reassess everything they thought they knew about the other. “What people usually say to me is that the lying and the deceit is worse than the betrayal,” says consultant clinical psychologist, Janice Hiller. “They say, ‘I can’t trust you. You’re not who you say you were.’ That’s the worst thing.” It hurts so much because it hits at the most primal part of our emotional selves. “The connection with an intimate partner re-evokes the earliest parent-child relationship,” she says. “It’s a very strong bond and it’s to do with honesty, security and commitment. We all want to be securely attached. Some people need a lot of daily contact. Some can manage two or three times a week. But we’re all looking for attachment, security and love. And when there’s a committed bond that’s broken in some way, it re-evokes that earliest fear of abandonment you see in little babies.” All of the counsellors I speak to agree: the most important thing is to rebuild that bond – by talking, listening, holding, touching, comforting, patiently restating your commitment, even if it feels like you’re doing it for the hundredth time. Is an affair a symptom of a bad relationship?Not necessarily. “Generally speaking, what motivates people to have affairs is underlying dissatisfaction in their lives,” says Bell. This may be a desire for more romance and intimacy in their relationship. After 10 or 20 years together, couples often end up feeling more like flatmates or colleagues than lovers. While lockdowns had a “honeymoon” effect on some couples, for many it led to feeling stale and short of excitement – and a temptation to look elsewhere (including online) for that thrill. However, Bell challenges the idea that affairs only occur in dysfunctional relationships. Some people in functional relationships are simply more prone to “acting out” their sexual urges than others; and not all dysfunctional relationships occasion affairs. “The popular view is that it’s a symptom of something going wrong, but opportunity, context, someone’s emotional state and social situations can also be predisposing factors for affairs.” Someone who has previously been sexually active with a wide variety of partners may find it easier to have an affair than someone more chaste, for example. Likewise, someone who goes on lots of work trips. The urge to stray might also be rooted in childhood trauma or exposure to infidelity in early life, says Bell. The point is, “It’s really worth stressing that affairs can also happen in excellent, fully functional marriages.” What should the betrayed partner do?Often, the discovery of an affair creates an unequal dynamic – one partner becomes crushed with guilt and accepts their pariah status, the other becomes judge, jury and executioner. But this is not particularly helpful or sustainable. “The betrayed partner will usually have to accept that they had a part in co-creating a betrayal,” says relationship counsellor and author Neil Wilkie. “My experience is that a betrayal never comes out of a clear blue sky. It usually happens because there was something lacking in a relationship. But if the betrayed partner says, ‘It’s all your fault, I had nothing to do with it,’ then the relationship can never recover.” So should we talk it through?Yes, says Dr Abigael San of the British Psychological Society – but she stresses that merely talking has its limits. “A lot of the time, couples counselling will concentrate on improving communication, which is certainly important, but it can be a rather superficial intervention,” she says. “You need to go much deeper than that. Chances are, the root cause of the affair will be something to do with the attachment bond, the absolute heart of a relationship.” This is where your focus should be. “You need to trust each other enough to be able to say what you’re feeling, why you might be feeling it, and to reach out to the other for help and trust that it will get a response. That’s the level of work that needs to be done. It will take sustained effort over time.” Should the partner who’s had the affair hand over their email passwords?Janice Hiller has a don’t ask, don’t tell policy. “If I can get couples early enough [after the discovery of an affair], I really encourage them not to answer any questions about the affair: the where, when, how,” she says. “People say, ‘I want to know everything.’ Actually, you don’t. The less you know the better. When people know more, they start to imagine more. You need to work on the trust and the healing process.” However, Neil Wilkie feels that handing over electronic devices, passwords, Instagram passwords and so on can be a useful way to start that process. “To recover from an affair, you need complete openness and honesty,” he says. “If the partner says, ‘No, that’s confidential’, then that’s effectively saying you can’t trust me.” He stresses, however, that allowing your partner an all-access pass to your innermost thoughts is an emergency measure. “The partner who has had the affair should be prepared to give the betrayed partner what is reasonable to rebuild the relationship. That may be more than they would normally be comfortable doing. However, if, say, two years have passed and one partner is still insisting on seeing absolutely everything, that shows the trust hasn’t been rebuilt – and that shadow of suspicion really dooms a relationship.” Who should I tell about the affair?Perhaps an incredibly trusted friend or two, but no more than is absolutely necessary, says Hiller. “Sometimes, the person who has been at the receiving end will tell everybody and it will be a disaster because friends and family then don’t want the partner back,” she says. “It’s so much better to contain it and work together – and with a therapist. If there’s a real decision to split up, that’s the time to tell people – not before. Nothing good comes out of talking about it.” In many instances, people do end up staying together – which leads to abiding feelings of betrayal and mistrust among friends who felt compelled to take sides. The advice is especially important where it comes to children, she says. “There is no need for your children to know. It’s none of their business. It can be really damaging to a child.” It’s fine to tell your children that you are having a difficult time and that you’re trying to sort things out, but the priority should be to reassure them that they are loved and safe. When should I get the lawyers involved?Only when all other options have been exhausted, says Julia Townend, barrister with family law firm 4PB: “It’s a myth that there are winners and losers in family law,” she says, stressing that it’s a misnomer that the person who has had the affair will always fare worse in court. “Actually, if someone has cheated, it almost never has an impact on any child-contact arrangements or how the money is divided up. It simply won’t be relevant.” Most of Townend’s work consists of stopping clients pressing the “nuclear button” and taking their partner to court. She tries to steer them towards mediation and has recently helped pioneer a “one-couple, one-lawyer” approach at her firm. “Instead of both people hiring lawyers to write aggressive letters to each other, we’ll try to get it sorted without the turmoil of going to court.” How do you rebuild? Neil Wilkie likes to break down relationships into six key areas. The first five (communication, connection, commitment, truth, growth) are fairly predictable, but he feels that the sixth – fun! – is neglected by most couples, particularly in the aftermath of something heavy like an affair. “I ask them: when was the last time you really had fun together? Often there’s nervousness and silence. It’s so easy to forget that we need to laugh and unleash that vibrancy in a relationship.” Find a way you can be silly together – and take it seriously.",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘All efforts should go towards repairing the trust’: how to survive an affair,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/14/all-efforts-should-go-towards-repairing-the-trust-how-to-survive-an-affair

1/14/2022,"When James Slack quit as Boris Johnson’s director of communications to become deputy editor-in-chief of the Sun, he might have hoped to avoid the glare of the media. But now Johnson’s former communications director finds himself as headline news, at the centre of a political scandal which highlights the revolving door between Britain’s political and media elite. Slack’s leaving do at Downing Street, complete with allegations of staff dragging a suitcase of booze into No 10 as lockdown restrictions remained in place, have unleashed further fury. He has already apologised “unreservedly for the anger and hurt caused” and said the event should not have taken place. The matter has been referred to an ongoing investigation into lockdown-busting parties led by the civil servant Sue Gray, which is due to report next week.  It is also prompting scrutiny of the Sun’s own coverage of the unfolding Downing Street party scandals and raises the awkward question of why they had not broken the news of this No 10 event, given they employ a witness who was present. Originally from Sheffield, Slack worked his way up local newspapers in the Midlands before moving to London, where he worked for news agencies and the Daily Express. After joining the Daily Mail, he was appointed as the newspaper’s political editor in 2015. Slack’s appointment in 2017 as the prime minister’s official spokesperson – responsible for holding daily briefings with lobby journalists – raised eyebrows as it was technically a civil service job, rather than a political appointment. He became part of May’s inner circle and gained a reputation among lobby journalists for being across detail of the endless Brexit negotiations, aided by this closeness. Slack’s civil service employment contract meant his job was secure when Johnson became prime minister. As a result, he retained his spokesperson job, answering questions on behalf of the man who had caused so much trouble for his former boss. He was ultimately promoted to the political appointment of director of communications in early 2021 – only to quit a few months later to join Rupert Murdoch’s Sun, an event that was marked with the now-notorious leaving party. The Sun has already had to deal with questions about its own staff being involved in boozy lockdown-breaking events. Before Slack joined the newspaper some of its staff held a Christmas party in the newspaper’s office in December 2020. A spokesperson for News UK, the owner of the Sun, said: “The matter was investigated as soon as it came to light and appropriate action was taken as a result.” On Friday, after issuing his apology, Slack was said to be at work in the Sun’s office in News UK in central London. Colleagues claim that other members of the Sun’s management team were only informed about their deputy editor’s Downing Street leaving party when contacted by the Daily Telegraph on Thursday afternoon. His future now potentially depends on the outcome of Gray’s investigation into No 10 parties during lockdown. Victoria Newton, the editor of the Sun, previously said she hired Slack because he knew what issues connected with the tabloid’s readers: “The Sun’s broad readership cares deeply about Britain and James has a strong understanding of our audience.” The issue the Sun is struggling with today is whether a lockdown-breaking party held in honour of their deputy editor – as the Queen prepared to bury Prince Philip at a socially distanced funeral – is too much for their audience.",News/Media,James Slack: the Sun deputy editor in latest No 10 party scandal,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/14/james-slack-the-sun-deputy-editor-in-latest-no-10-party-scandal
1/14/2022,"Calls have been made in York for Prince Andrew to relinquish his title of Duke of York, with the city’s Labour MP calling it “untenable”. The demand by Rachael Maskell, the MP for York Central, echoed sentiments expressed by a senior councillor, Darryl Smalley, who said the association was tarnishing the city’s reputation.  Maskell said: “It’s untenable for the Duke of York to cling on to his title another day longer; this association with York must end. There’s a very serious allegation made against this man of privilege and entitlement. I’m working with agencies to tackle sexual violence and misogyny.” Smalley, a Liberal Democrat who is an executive member for culture, leisure and communities on the city of York council, said it had been argued that Andrew losing titles was important to protect the military. “I think the vast majority of people in York feel exactly the same in protecting the reputation of the city.” Smalley said it might require an act of parliament to remove the title but that should not stop it happening because of the shame being brought on Andrew as Duke of York. “York is fantastic, we have got a lot to be proud of and one thing we don’t want is to be so burdened with this link to Prince Andrew.” Given the cost of living crisis and the scandal over the Covid parties in Downing Street, Smalley said he was not going to pretend that Prince Andrew was the number one issue for residents of York. “It is important for us as councillors and city leaders that we raise these concerns, just as servicemen and veterans did in their letter to the Queen. “It’s our duty really to make clear that we are very unhappy that despite him not using titles such as ‘His Royal Highness’ he still somehow retains the title of Duke of York.

1/14/2022,"For three months they were subject to whims of a roaring volcano. Now residents on the small Spanish island of La Palma are wrestling with another dilemma: what do with the millions of cubic metres of lava and ash it left behind. The volcano rumbled for 85 days, ejecting ash and rivers of lava that swallowed more than 1,000 homes, cut off highways and suffocated the lush banana plantations that drive the island’s economy.  The eruption was declared over on Christmas Day, leaving residents grappling with the daunting task of rebuilding. “It’s brutal,” said Javier Moreno, one of La Palma’s 80,000 residents. “The affected area looks as if they erected the Berlin Wall, but made of black lava.” In recent days about 2,000 of the 7,000 evacuated residents have been allowed to return home. Many arrived to find layers of powdery ash coating their homes, patios and plants – remnants of the more than 200m cubic metres of lava and ash expelled by the volcano. “It’s a continuous battle,” said Moreno. “You clear it away today, tomorrow the wind blows over a few more centimetres.” In parts of the island the ash buried homes, engulfed verdant plantations and accumulated in metres-high banks. The lava and ash reached beyond the island; lava cascading into the ocean during the eruptions created two new peninsulas, measuring 44 and five hectares, while underwater footage revealed marine life covered in ash. While round-the-clock efforts to clear the ash have succeeded in stockpiling some of it in specific areas such as a former quarry on the island, removal of the red-hot flows of lava that sprawled into neighbourhoods and farmland has proved trickier. “They continue to store heat, with temperatures of more than 100 degrees [Celsius] in some parts,” said Inés Galindo, a geologist who heads the Canary Islands unit of Spain’s Geological and Mining Institute. Once the lava cools – a process that could take months – it might be easier in some cases to build on top of it rather than breaking it up and removing it, she added. As researchers and officials scramble to figure out what could be done with the materials spewed out by the volcano, they’ve looked to history. In the nearby island of Lanzarote, a six-year eruption in 1730 left parts of the island covered in volcanic material. “The particles were porous and able to retain water in the soil … they took advantage of it to plant vineyards,” said Galindo. She and her team are now studying the properties of the ash in La Palma to see whether it could be used in a similar way while another team of researchers are probing whether the mineral-rich soil could be used as fertiliser. Regional officials, meanwhile, are exploring the possibility of using the ash to build homes, roads and bridges across the island. “It’s not an original idea, we’re using the techniques that the Romans used,” said Javier Juvera, an engineer with the department of public works in the Canary Islands. “The Romans worked with the ashes that came out of [Mount] Vesuvius, using them to build their basilicas and buildings.” His team is now working to determine whether the ash scattered across the island is similar to the volcanic ash used by the Romans to bind rock fragments. If so, it could give rise to a durable construction material and play a role in rebuilding the island, where regional officials have estimated the loss of buildings and infrastructure at more than €900m (£750m). Juvera described the ideas as a seemingly natural fit for a for an archipelago hewn from volcanic activity spanning millions of years. “In the Canary Islands we’re used to working with volcanic materials,” he said, citing the longstanding practice of mixing cement and material extracted from volcanic cones to build homes. Both Juvera and Galindo said it would be months before they had any definitive answers on what could be done with the blizzard of dark ash ejected by the volcano. “The quantity of materials is so enormous – there are images of homes that were practically buried in ash,” said Juvera. “But if we don’t find a value for it, it becomes waste.”",News/World news,La Palma’s volcanic headache: what to do with all the lava and ash,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/14/la-palma-volcano-lava-ash-island
1/14/2022,"Britney Spears has hit back at her younger sister, Jamie Lynn, who made allegations about the singer’s mental health and behaviour. Speaking to Good Morning America in an interview to promote her forthcoming memoir, Jamie Lynn Spears alleged that Britney once locked them both in a room while holding a knife. She also claimed that her sister had screamed in her face during the Covid-19 lockdown, and described her behaviour over the years as “erratic, paranoid and spiralling”.  On Twitter, Britney responded that she and Jamie Lynn rarely spent time together “15 years ago” – the era in which Spears was experiencing a very public period of mental ill health – and said: “So why are they even talking about that unless she wants to sell a book at my expense?” Jamie Lynn was also asked why Britney had objected to her sister performing a remix of her songs at the 2017 Radio Disney Awards, which Britney said in July “hurt me deeply”. “I was doing a tribute to honour my sister and all the amazing things that she’s done,” Jamie Lynn said. “I don’t think she’s personally upset with me about that. Truthfully, I don’t know why that bothers her.” Britney responded: “It may sound like a silly thing to most people, but I wrote a lot of my songs and my sister was the baby. She never had to work for anything. Everything was always given to her!” She claimed that Jamie Lynn said the performance wasn’t her idea”. She sarcastically wished her sister success with her memoir. Britney continued to say that her family had “ruined my dreams 100 billion per cent and try to make me look like the crazy one … My family loves to pull me down and hurt me always so I am disgusted with them.” She also pointed the finger at the media and the entertainment industry, saying it had “always been extremely hateful” to her. “I’ve given enough … MORE than enough … I was never given back what I want.” In November, Britney Spears successfully terminated the conservatorship that governed her life and career for nearly 14 years. She said soon after that she believed her family “should all be in jail” for the “demoralising and degrading” treatment she experienced under the arrangement. Jamie Lynn has made few public comments on the conservatorship and her role in its management is unclear. Posting on Instagram in June, she said: “Maybe I didn’t support [Britney the way] the public would like me to with the hashtag on a public platform, but I can assure you that I supported my sister long before there was a hashtag, and I’ll support her long after”. Jamie Lynn’s memoir, Things I Should Have Said, is published on 18 January by Hachette’s Christian imprint, Worthy Books.

1/14/2022,"It’s more than 10 years since Thebe Kgositsile first skated into view as Earl Sweatshirt, the teenage enfant terrible of Los Angeles rap collective Odd Future. Since then, the Chicago-born rapper has largely turned his back on the provocative juvenilia that made him so chaotically appealing, instead turning inwards for a series of albums of inscrutable sermons that float over hazy, snipped beats.  Earl’s style and sauntering nihilism have found new context amid the lo-fi street philosophy of newer peers such as Mach-Hommy and Westside Gunn – storytellers whose candour is matched by the nonchalance of their delivery, sketching in scant but precise details, and occasional winking wit. Sick! continues in this vein. These 10 songs, rarely more than two minutes long, are as fleeting as thoughts had in the shower or recollections of a fever dream – as in the twinkling roll of 2010 (“We got us a fire to rekindle”), the title track’s discombobulating array of silver screen samples or the run-on lines and homophone rhyme schemes of Lye. Musically, it’s an alluring mesh: all haunting organs, guitars soaked in reverb, and skittish, stoned drum hits. Earl was recording a different album when the pandemic hit, his focus shifted and the computer containing the older recordings got lost. The bright strings of Old Friend, and the dense, extended monologues of Tabula Rasa are the surviving remnants of the shelved project. They offer the promise of something more perhaps in the future, with richer, bolder production: another tantalising glimpse of Earl’s unique and enduring charm.",Arts/Music,Earl Sweatshirt: Sick! review – fragments from a fever dream,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/14/earl-sweatshirt-sick-review-odd-future
