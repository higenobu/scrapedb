1/19/2022,"Thomas Tuchel diagnosed a severe case of fatigue among his suddenly struggling Chelsea players after their 1-1 draw at Brighton /on Tuesday night and aims to arrest it by giving them two days off before the weekend. “They need it [Wednesday and Thursday off] so badly,” said Tuchel whose team sit third in the Premier League, 12 points behind the leaders Manchester City and have failed to win any of their past four league games, collecting just two points from a possible 12.  “It has been like this since November, we are a team that plays and plays and plays. We need to de-connect, that is my feeling. We need to give the players two days off. There is no other solution.” The draw further dented Chelsea’s already rapidly receding title hopes and their manager duly sounded somewhat fed up after watching Hakim Ziyech give his side the lead before Adam Webster’s header secured a deserved point for Graham Potter’s impressive Brighton. When a reporter pointed out Chelsea have now won only one of their last seven league games and wondered “where it had gone wrong”, he received unusually short shrift from a slightly tetchy Tuchel. “We were mentally tired and physically tired,” said the German, pointing out that Chelsea’s amalgam of fixture congestion, injuries and Covid cases was bound to catch up with them at some point and they required a rest before facing Tottenham on Sunday. “It’s not just about playing, it’s about travelling and sleeping. But we have to respect the opponent. It’s very hard to play at Brighton – and we didn’t lose. Other teams will struggle to get points here. We were a bit lucky to be 1-0 up. I simply refuse to be angry. This can happen at an away game in the middle of January. Don’t tell me it’s never happened to Chelsea teams before. We didn’t achieve our full potential and we want to do better but welcome to reality. We have to accept it’s a certain level of fatigue.” Graham Potter was considerably happier. “We played with courage, heart, quality and intensity,” said Brighton’s manager. “We’re really proud of the performance; it had everything.”",Sport/Football,Thomas Tuchel to give tired Chelsea players a break after Brighton draw,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/18/thomas-tuchel-to-give-tired-chelsea-players-a-break-after-brighton-draw
1/19/2022,"William Barr, Donald Trump’s second attorney general and perceived “hatchet man” until he split from the former president over his lies about election fraud, will publish his memoirs in March.  HarperCollins, the publisher of One Damn Thing After Another: Memoirs of an Attorney General, promised a “vivid and forthright” read on Barr’s long career in law and conservative politics, in which he was first attorney general under George HW Bush. “Barr takes readers behind the scenes during seminal moments of the Bush administration in the 1990s, from the LA riots to Pan Am 103 and Iran Contra,” the publisher said on Tuesday. “With the Trump administration, Barr faced an unrelenting barrage of issues, such as Russia-gate, the opioid epidemic, Chinese espionage, big tech, the Covid outbreak, civil unrest, the first impeachment, and the 2020 election fallout.” The publisher also said Barr would help readers understand how Bush and Trump “viewed power and justice at critical junctures of their presidencies”. During the investigation of Russian election meddling and links between Trump and Moscow, Barr stoked rage among Democrats who accused him of interfering on behalf of the president. His handling of Robert Mueller’s report also prompted protest from the special counsel himself. Republicans and other observers defended Barr but the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, then a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president, called him “a disgrace” and “not a credible head of federal law enforcement”. Barr was also present during key flash points of the Trump administration, for instance, walking at the president’s side in summer 2020 when he marched across Washington DC’s Lafayette Square, which had been cleared of protesters against racism and police brutality, to stage a photo op at a historic church. Barr split from Trump as the president refused to admit defeat by Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Angry scenes between the two men have been reported in other books, including bestsellers by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa of the Washington Post and Jon Karl of ABC News. Barr stoked Trump’s rage by telling the Associated Press he had not seen evidence of “fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election”. He was no longer in office during the culmination of Trump’s concerted attempt to overturn his election defeat – the deadly Capitol riot of January 6. On 7 January 2021, Barr condemned Trump for “orchestrating a mob to pressure Congress” and said: “The president’s conduct was a betrayal of his office and supporters.” The same day, the Guardian published an article examining the state of the Department of Justice after Barr’s second stint in the chair. Vanita Gupta, a former head of the civil rights division, said: “The morale and the reputation of the department has been gutted because of undue political influence on the decisions of career staff. “The department needs to be rebuilt by new leadership committed at every turn to decisions made on the law and on the facts, and not on what the president wants.” On Tuesday, Sadie Gurman, a Wall Street Journal reporter, was among observers to note the provenance – and irony – of Barr’s chosen title. Current attorney general Merrick Garland, Gurman said, might appreciate that “Barr’s book title is actually an homage to his hero, Ed Levi”, who, when asked “to describe the job of attorney general … famously replied, ‘It’s just one damn thing after another.’” Ed Levi, a law professor and “non-politician”, was installed by Gerald Ford in 1975, after the Watergate scandal brought down Richard Nixon and his attorney general, John Mitchell – who served time in prison.",News/US news,Donald Trump’s former attorney general William Barr to publish his memoirs,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/18/donald-trump-attorney-general-william-barr-memoir
1/19/2022,"“It’s probably my proudest moment,” said the captain Serena Guthrie after England came from behind to tie their third Quad Series game 48-48 with the world No 1 team, Australia, before playing them again in the final on Wednesday. “We showed them who we are,” she added. Having already both guaranteed a shot at the title thanks to victories over New Zealand and South Africa, this game was touted as a dress-rehearsal before the title decider: ultimately meaningless but an important test of character.  Two minutes, 32 seconds was the time it took for the first goal of the game to sink. As the ball jerked its way down the court every inch was contested as the teams, having not met in two years, got the measure of each other’s will. Up in the first quarter thanks to the formidable efforts of the Diamonds’ goalkeeper Sarah Klau, Australia stole the lead and forced England’s hand. Looking a markedly different side with Eleanor Cardwell moved into goal attack, the position shifts sparked initial joy for the Roses who doggedly clawed back the five-goal deficit hanging over their heads. But an unrelenting and hungry Australia quickly adapted, pushing the score back to 19-23 at half-time. The substitutions continued throughout the game, revealing that a second, poker-like game was also going on. England head coach Jess Thirlby and her opposite number Stacey Marinkovich seemed to make the most of the game of ‘no consequences’. Up, down, level, reset – whichever players were on court, they never let the competition subside. In a fourth quarter pile-up Beth Cobden emerged victorious and the England bench roared. It might not have mattered to anyone else but to the players it did. “To believe anything is possible you need some evidence,” said Thirlby. “I think we’re starting to build a really nice collection of evidence that we’re not beaten by any team, and we’ve got a place around the table.” Sensing the occasion, clutch shooter Helen Housby shifted gear and England came to life. Hanging on until the final whistle it was almost poetic that, heading into the final everything, and nothing, had been established. Every England Rose is willing but which seven will start? Can England cross the line at the second time of asking and claim a maiden Quad Series title? All will be revealed.",Sport/Sport,England force tense draw with Australia before Quad Series final rematch,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/18/england-force-tense-draw-with-australia-before-quad-series-final-rematch
1/19/2022,"The US congressional committee investigating the deadly January 6 Capitol attack has issued a blitz of subpoenas to some of Donald Trump’s top lawyers – including Rudy Giuliani – as the panel continues to gather information on the former president’s attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.  The House select committee subpoenaed four of Trump’s legal team on Tuesday: the former president’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and his associate Boris Epshteyn, as well as Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis, who all worked to defend Trump’s baseless voter fraud claims as he attempted to undermine the election result. Congressman Bennie Thompson, the chairman of the select committee, said in a statement that the panel issued the subpoenas to the four Trump lawyers because they were “in direct contact with the former president about attempts to stop the counting of electoral votes”. The move by the select committee amounts to another dramatic escalation in the 6 January investigation as the orders compel Trump’s lawyers to produce documents and testimony despite claims of attorney-client privilege, suggesting the panel believes the lawyers may have acted unlawfully.
