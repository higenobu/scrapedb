12/13/2021,"At least one person in the UK had died with the Omicron variant, Boris Johnson has said as he refused to rule out imposing further restrictions across England in the run-up to Christmas. Following a warning from Britain’s top health officials revealed by the Guardian that the government has been advised “stringent national measures” need to be imposed this week, the prime minister said he would “take whatever steps are necessary to protect public health”.  Concern is mounting among scientists and in Whitehall that the Omicron variant could soon become the dominant Covid strain, weakening the defences two vaccines offer against the virus. Johnson, who is preparing to face a rebellion from at least 70 Tory MPs on Tuesday over some of his “plan B” measures and under fire for Christmas parties held in Downing Street last year, said Omicron was likely to form the majority of new cases in London within the next 24 hours. Speaking at a vaccine centre in Paddington, west London, after pledging to speed up the booster programme, he said: “We now want to hit warp speed and we’ll have to attain a pace and a number of daily booster doses that will exceed anything that we’ve done before.” Johnson confirmed Omicron was “producing hospitalisations” and added: “Sadly at least one patient has been confirmed to have died with Omicron.” He stressed: “I think the idea that this is somehow a milder version of the virus, I think that’s something we need to set on one side and just recognise the sheer pace at which it accelerates through the population. So the best thing we can do is all get our boosters.” Johnson repeatedly refused to rule out tougher Covid restrictions beyond the latest advice to work from home, making masks mandatory in more places and requiring proof of vaccination or a recent negative test result for entry to some venues. He said: “Throughout the pandemic I’ve been at great pains to stress to the public that we have to watch where the pandemic is going and we take whatever steps are necessary to protect public health. “We think the steps that we are taking – so plan B, combined with a hugely ambitious acceleration of the booster campaign, bringing it forward by a month so we offer a booster to every adult by the end of the year – we think that’s the right approach.” Asked about a Christmas quiz he hosted in Downing Street last year, when London was in tier 2 and indoor social mixing was banned, Johnson insisted he “certainly broke no rules”. He said the cabinet secretary, Simon Case, was investigating the matter and would report back “as soon as we reasonably can”.",News/World news,"At least one person in UK has died with Omicron, says Boris Johnson",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/13/at-least-one-person-in-uk-has-died-with-omicron-says-boris-johnson
12/13/2021,"AChristmas show about James Bond? Well, not quite. In Eastern Angles theatre company’s production, MI5 and MI6 have merged to save money for the new Downing Street meeting room. This means 007 is unaffordable, so we’re left with the not so charming knock-off, James Boond (Herb Cuanalo). With a mission to investigate the disappearance of a nuclear scientist and amateur birdwatcher, Professor Padraig O’Plenty, our hero’s journey is more chaotic than stylishly smooth. Behind a silver curtain on the stage that forms part of Emily Bestow’s factory-looking playground set, complete with spray-painted silver ladders and fireman’s pole, the actors hurriedly change costumes to switch character. Despite some wholehearted performances – particularly from Lottie Davies as the larger-than-life turkey rearer, Matthew Bernarde – much of the humour feels hammy and barely gets an audience snigger. “Why are we laughing,” the evil accomplice Major Ovaranova asks international woman of mystery, Edie Effe. “Well, someone has to,” she replies – and we can’t help but agree.  Led by Boond we are introduced to a medley of not exactly traditional Bond characters. Alice Robinson convincingly transforms from the Irish almost Bond girl Kitty to secretary Spendapenny, but too often the momentum is slowed by pitchy renditions of Chris Warner’s music. Still, this not-quite-panto directed by Ivan Cutting is somewhat lovable. Firmly set in the theatre company’s home of Ipswich (Rushmere is a nearby village), there are fond references to local supermarkets and the nearby district of California, and the high points come when the audience is spoken to directly. Though not overflowing with belly-aching gags, this alternative pantomime is full of heart. From Rushmere With Love is at Sir John Mills theatre, Ipswich, and also live-streamed until 8 January.",Arts/Stage,"From Rushmere With Love review – the name’s Boond, James Boond",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/dec/13/from-rushmere-with-love-review
12/13/2021,"The FIA’s handling of the highly controversial ending to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix has been heavily criticised as the sport “marking its own homework” by a leading international arbitration lawyer. Duncan Bagshaw believes Mercedes would have a strong case for the decisions which cost Lewis Hamilton an almost certain win and the Formula One world championship, to be overturned.  Red Bull’s Max Verstappen was crowned world champion after taking a dramatic last-lap victory at the Yas Marina circuit but the result was confirmed only after hours of deliberation and two rejected Mercedes’ protests following a disputed intervention during the final laps by the FIA race director, Michael Masi. Bagshaw, a barrister at Howard Kennedy specialising in international arbitration and litigation, was dismissive of the process and said Mercedes would be in a strong position to mount legal action. “There was a challenge to the FIA last night which was resolved very quickly,” he said on the BBC’s Today programme. “The FIA, marking its own homework, perhaps unsurprisingly said that they stood by the decision of the race director Michael Masi. Mercedes do have a case and I think it is quite likely they will take it to a court of arbitration because so much turns on the outcome of these races they may feel they really have no choice.” Hamilton had looked in control and on for the win when five laps from the end a safety car was triggered after Nicholas Latifi crashed his Williams. Verstappen pitted for fresh tyres with which to attack Hamilton while Mercedes kept their man out to maintain track position. With so few laps to go the expectation would ordinarily have been for the race to conclude under the safety car. However it appeared that the FIA wanted to ensure it was finished with a racing lap. Mercedes believe there was an unfair FIA intervention to ensure Verstappen was right behind Hamilton’s for that final lap shootout. Red Bull’s team principal Christian Horner had requested the FIA race director, Michael Masi act to allow the lapped cars between Verstappen and Hamilton to unlap themselves leaving the title protagonists closed-up for the crucial final lap. Having initially stated they would not be allowed to do so, it was then announced that those five cars specifically could unlap themselves. When racing resumed Hamilton was a sitting duck on much older tyres and Verstappen swiftly passed him to take the win and the title. Mercedes protested the handling of the safety car procedures but had their protests rejected. Mercedes intend to appeal against the decisions rejecting their protests but they could yet go further. They can take their case to the dispute resolution procedure under F1’s concorde agreement, the contract between the teams, the FIA and the commercial rights holder and they could also take it to the court of arbitration for sport in Switzerland. Considering his interpretation of what happened, Bagshaw was convinced Mercedes had a good case to do so. “This decision was by the race director himself applying a rule under the regulations which is, I would say, very clear and quite explicit about what has to happen in this situation. “Everybody wanted to see that race finish in racing conditions but the rule makes it very clear that any cars that have been lapped by the leader have to be allowed to pass the leading cars and the safety car before the race is restarted and he did not allow that to happen. “It’s very important for Mercedes to give the message that racing is the most important thing to this sport and that they respect the outcome of the race on the track but they must also accept the fact that commercially this is a sport that revolves around money. “They have obligations to Lewis Hamilton, their team, their sponsors and many other people, it may be not so much they want to challenge this decision, that they want this season to be decided before a committee of arbitrators but simply that they don’t have any choice.”",Sport/Sport,Lawyer warns FIA Abu Dhabi GP decision could be overturned in court,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/13/lawyer-warns-fia-abu-dhabi-decision-could-be-overturned-in-court
12/13/2021,"Fairly early on Monday morning last week I got a call from a radio station: could I come on to discuss a study showing London is the world’s most congested city, and this is because of cycle lanes. Hang on, I replied – say all that again? As it turned out, I never appeared (someone else got the part). But, intrigued, I looked into the research which supposedly showed all this. And that was when things started to get strange.  Both claims: London being the world’s most congested city, and cycle lanes being part of the problem – were all over the media that morning. This included outlets you would expect (Daily Mail: “Cycle lanes installed at start of Covid pandemic help make London most congested city in world”) and some you’d hope better of (BBC London: “Cycle lanes blamed as city named most congested”). And yet … both arguments were seemingly nonsense. They were based on a report called the Global Traffic Scorecard by a company called Inrix, which sells traffic data. The first problem was the claim of London being the world’s most traffic-clogged city, a position no similar ranking has ever given it. One clue came when I got hold of the report – it doesn’t even list a single city in Asia or Africa. This wasn’t a global study, it was one based on where Inrix happens to operate. Even more of a puzzle was the idea of cycle lanes being at least partly responsible. The papers carried the same quotes, from an Inrix employee called Peter Lees. “Use of roads is all about supply and demand,” he said. “If the demand goes up but the road space is being shared with other forms of transport, there’s less tarmac effectively for the cars to be on, which then has an impact on the speeds on the road and therefore congestion.” There are two problems with this, the first and more pressing being that it shows a fairly worrying ignorance about the fundamentals of traffic. I don’t wish to rehash many decades of research, but the basics are that you can’t liken traffic to water, with the width of the pipe determining how much can flow. Traffic is very different, as shown countless times through the idea of induced demand. The second problem is that even the Global Traffic Scorecard doesn’t make this argument. Cycle lanes do not even get a mention in its 21 pages. So where did it come from? Seemingly, it was straight from Lees, who was interviewed by PA Media, the news agency. PA included them on Sunday in an embargoed story, which was then picked up by the other outlets. The PA story identified Lees as the “Inrix operations director” but his official title is actually “director of operations – media”. He’s head of press, not a traffic wonk. How did all this happen? Inrix and Lees have been somewhat coy. After several emails last week, Lees said he could answer queries in writing, which I sent. But despite several followups, all I got was digital tumbleweed. One slight plot twist came in a tweet which reprinted a reply from Lees to an Imperial College London scientist querying the findings. The No 1 ranking for London, Lees said, “indicates a positive economic rebound [from Covid] for the UK”. Cycle lanes were mentioned among “much smaller contributory factors”. Some of the headlines were “not accurately representing what we said”. Without wanting to get too Hercule Poirot, I think we have a plausible sequence of events here. A company that makes its money from the auto industry, and which is part owned by Porsche, tries to get some free PR by publicising its research in arguably questionable terms. The head of media does an interview and floats the extra, newsworthy theory. Was this a planned ruse? Perhaps we’ll never know. Either way, we have a pair of myths escaped into the wild, where they will lurk for years, turning up occasionally as evidence in the weird culture war against cycling. Already one has appeared: a Sunday Telegraph article this weekend arguing against low-traffic neighbourhoods confidently named London as the world’s most congested city. What can we do? Not much, I supposed, except simply, and yet again, observe the depressing and slippery slope from press release to news story to unkillable myth when it comes to cycling stories. I’d like to think some people would learn lessons from this debacle. But I’m not exactly confident.",News/Environment,How a myth about London bike lanes and congestion took off,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2021/dec/13/how-a-myth-about-london-bike-lanes-and-congestion-took-flight
12/13/2021,"‘How do you feel about killing somebody? Because us getting out of here is pretty goddamn dependent on it.” Dolph Lundgren and Scott Adkins make a fine odd couple in this meatily satisfying action film – once it gets moving. The ageing hulk is on prime form, juggling directorial duties with a Balboan blue-collar turn in front of the camera, while Adkins, the current king of kickass B-movies, again shows his range and brings the Brit-comedy – a levity that borders on dorky, if that’s an appropriate word to describe a martial-arts matinee idol capable of caressing your jaw with a spin-kick. Adkins plays Mike Wade, an over-the-hill MMA fighter from Birmingham, England, down on his luck in Birmingham, Alabama. Cadging a job as part of a demolition crew stripping Castle Heights hospital, he finds a three-holdall stash of greenbacks in a cupboard. With the building due to be dynamited in 90 minutes, he returns solo for the money – unaware that two other interested parties are also moving in: Lundgren’s prison guard Ericson, who needs to finance his daughter’s cancer treatment, and a gang kingpin (Scott Hunter) out to secure the loot on behalf of his incarcerated brother.  That’s all that needs to be said. Andrew Knauer’s script spends the first third of the film unnecessarily detailing the various allegiances, which defers the good stuff: Lundgren and Adkins pounding seven shades out of each other and then teaming up against the real heavies. Lundgren, in his fleece and spectacles, looks like the most virile crown-green bowling player you’ve ever seen. With a surprisingly substantial action-directing resumé behind him, Lundgren makes strong positional use of the decrepit high-rise in a way that Die Hard did expertly, though his action choreography – serviceable but staid – is less cutting-edge than Gareth Evans’s in The Raid. With so many factions in play, Adkins arguably doesn’t carry Castle Falls as much as he should – and deserves a better character flaw than “must overcome continually being put in a sleeper hold”. Crammed into the film’s back half, his and Lundgren’s break for the ground floor feels like it’s only just getting going, but this is a partnership that deserves to have legs.

12/13/2021,"It’s a genuine thrill to encounter a film as exciting and immediate as Flee. The true story at its centre is a harrowing and suspenseful refugee narrative of loss and resilience, and director Jonas Poher Rasmussen could have brought it to the screen in many ways, almost all of them more conventionally easier than the one he finally chose. Rasmussen’s friend, known in the film as Amin, is an Afghan refugee who agrees to share how he made his way from war-torn Kabul in the 80s to now, living a settled, open life in Denmark as a gay man, one he’d never thought was possible. In animating the interviews with Amin and the various events being recalled, Rasmussen finds an unusually immersive way to pull us in even closer, one that’s both emotionally involving and artfully realised. Amin’s childhood, as with many others like him, was interrupted in the late 80s as conflict forced him and his family to escape their home, finding their way to Moscow.  Rasmussen also includes montages of archival footage, deftly informing us of the basics of the political chaos that surrounds Amin’s life in both Afghanistan and Russia. It’s impossible to recall a refugee story told with such devastating efficacy as well as such specific nuance, showing us the horrors Amin experienced but also, importantly, how they stuck to him in the years after and still do. There’s a natural rhythm and sense of discovery to these recollections, as if Amin is working so much of it out for himself still as he talks. It’s a nakedly personal film and we feel honoured being allowed in the room with them. Flee is a remarkably humanising and complex film, expanding and expounding the kind of story that’s too easily simplified. Rasmussen has created a loving and unsparing tribute to his friend.",Arts/Film,"The 50 best films of 2021 in the US, No 5: Flee ",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/13/the-50-best-films-of-2021-in-the-us-no-5-flee
12/13/2021,"Bookmakers have made the Liberal Democrats the favourites to win this week’s North Shropshire byelection, odds that if reflected in Thursday’s vote would deliver a significant fresh blow to Boris Johnson’s authority. Lib Dem campaigners stress that the result is hard to predict, given variables such as turnout and the number of Labour and Green supporters who decide to vote tactically.  But the party says it is “neck and neck” in the usually ultra-safe Conservative seat, which was held by Owen Paterson in the 2019 election with a near-23,000 majority and has been Tory for all but two of the last 190 years. The byelection was called when Paterson resigned after Johnson abandoned efforts to change the disciplinary system for MPs to save the former environment secretary from being punished for breaking rules on paid lobbying. Although the Lib Dems finished third to Paterson and Labour in 2019, with 10% of the vote, they have successfully positioned themselves as the most likely opposition party to cause an upset, and have been consistently second favourites in voting odds. But following Johnson’s tumultuous week facing claims over lockdown-busting Christmas parties in Downing Street and questions over the financing of renovations to his official flat, bookmakers have the Lib Dem candidate, Helen Morgan, as favourite, at about 1/2. In contrast, the odds for the Conservatives’ choice to replace Paterson, Neil Shastri-Hurst, a Birmingham-based barrister, have lengthened to about 6/4. While the Labour candidate, Ben Wood, has been fighting an energetic campaign and says he is the main challenger, party officials have devoted few resources to North Shropshire. Speaking on Sunday, the Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi effectively acknowledged the party had deliberately left the field clear for the Lib Dems. “Well, it’s realistic,” the shadow Foreign Office minister told Times Radio. “I mean, let’s face it, Labour are never going to win North Shropshire. The Lib Dems do have an opportunity to do so. “It’s not just soft-pedalling, I do think that in constituencies like these ones, where Labour don’t have a huge amount of resources … we know, realistically, we have no chance of winning.” Another imponderable is the strength of support for the Greens’ candidate, Duncan Kerr, given strong local election results for the party last May, giving it 12 of 18 council seats in Oswestry, the constituency’s biggest town. Overall, the result remains very difficult to call, with other complications including a notably short campaign, in which some locals received postal votes before the parties had a chance to contact them. A key factor could be how many traditional Conservative voters who are now dissatisfied with the party and with Johnson decide to stay at home on Thursday, or even to vote Lib Dem. Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dems’ deputy leader, who spent the weekend campaigning in North Shropshire, said support for the Conservatives there “has collapsed”. She said: “We are now neck and neck with the Conservatives and our campaigners are flooding into the constituency from across the country. “As we enter the final few days of the campaign, the crucial question is: will enough Labour and Green voters vote tactically for the Lib Dems? If they do, this could help deliver a knockout blow to Boris Johnson.”",News/Politics,Bookies make Lib Dems favourite in North Shropshire poll,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/13/bookies-make-lib-dems-favourite-in-north-shropshire-poll-owen-paterson-byelection
12/13/2021,"Druid theatre company’s triple bill by Seán O’Casey comes with music hall flourishes and a light touch. Rarely performed, these one-act comedies show a very different side to the O’Casey whose major dramas from the 1920s tackled the political conflicts and tragedies of his times. With the endlessly inventive cast going all out for the ridiculous, Garry Hynes’ production delivers farce with hints of satire. While an anti-authoritarian theme runs through all three plays, Bedtime Story from 1951 has the most pointed comments to make, in this case about religious hypocrisy and sexual double standards. Set in a claustrophobic boarding house, it concerns a pious young man, John Jo (Aaron Monaghan), who wants to cover up the fact that he has invited a woman, Angela (Sarah Morris), back to his room overnight. As he haplessly tries to smuggle her out of the house and pretend it never happened, Angela turns the tables on him, with the audience cheering her on.  Petty officialdom is the obstacle to two men’s carousing in A Pound on Demand (1939) in which Jerry (Rory Nolan), moderately less drunk than his pal, Sammy (Aaron Monaghan), attempts to help him withdraw money from his post office account, although he can barely sign his name. With her modicum of power, the postmistress (Venetia Bowe) relishes obstructing them, supported by her admirer, the village policeman (Liam Heslin). As they lurch dangerously or are flung out through the door, Nolan and Monaghan’s brilliant comic timing compensates for a flimsy script. Clowning and slapstick are central to the stage business in The End of the Beginning (1937). In a contest between a farmer husband, Darry (Rory Nolan) and wife Lizzie (Sarah Morris), absurd male antics ensue, with the self-important Darry joined by the delightfully gormless Barry (Marty Rea) to attempt a day’s housework. All gangling limbs, Barry adds to the ensuing mayhem: a mess of broken crockery, spilled oil and a heifer on the loose. With designer Francis O’Connor’s lovingly detailed period sets and costumes, piano interludes in true vaudeville style from composer Conor Linehan, this production wraps O’Casey’s lesser works in a seasonal bow.

Though the Blues eventually lost to a late winner from Ellen White, their interim manager, Darren Carter, believes the performance shows the team will fight to stay up. “The perception of Birmingham at the moment is we’re a soft touch and it’s easy to get points against us – that’s a narrative we want to change,” he said. “Hopefully today they’ve sent a message that we’re no longer going to roll over in games.

12/13/2021,"Manchester United will face Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 of the Champions League after a controversial mix-up with the draw. It means Ralf Rangnick’s team must find a way past a squad that includes Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappé and Neymar and whose manager, Mauricio Pochettino, is known to be interested in the Old Trafford job. Messi is also set to face Cristiano Ronaldo.  The other Premier League clubs were dealt less mouthwatering ties, with Chelsea continuing their defence of the trophy against Lille, Manchester City going up against Villarreal and Liverpool taking on Red Bull Salzburg. The pick of the other matches look set to be Atlético Madrid v Bayern Munich and Internazionale v Ajax. Sporting play Juventus and Benfica face Real Madrid in the remaining ties. The controversy surrounded United appearing to be excluded from the group of teams eligible to face Atlético. United were initially drawn to face Villarreal, whom they met in the group stage and were therefore unable to meet in the last 16. Uefa officials corrected the mistake and Andrey Arshavin pulled City’s name from the bowl. But in the draw for the next tie, against Atlético, Uefa’s deputy general secretary, Giorgio Marchetti, incorrectly stated that United had already been drawn and their ball did not appear to be placed in the bowl with those eligible to play Diego Simeone’s team. United beat PSG in the last 16 in the 2018-19 season on away goals, a result that helped Ole Gunnar Solskjær to get the manager’s job full-time. Marcus Rashford’s stoppage-time penalty proved decisive in Paris and the teams met in last season’s group stage, each winning the away match. Pochettino’s presence adds a further layer of intrigue to this season’s encounters given that he would be interested in taking over as manager from Rangnick, who is due to take a consultancy role when his interim spell ends in the summer. Rangnick has said he would be open to continuing as manager. The prospect of Messi facing Ronaldo will gain plenty of attention too. Messi recently won a seventh Ballon d’Or, taking him two clear of Ronaldo’s haul, and the pair have most notably faced one other during spells with Barcelona and Real Madrid respectively. They have met in 36 previous games, with Messi finishing on the winning side 16 times and Ronaldo 11, the Argentinian scoring 22 goals to Ronaldo’s 21.

The local newspaper the Argus Leader reported $5,000 (£3,770) in single dollar bills were laid out on the ice skating ring during the Sioux Falls Stampede hockey game on Saturday night, and the teachers from nearby schools competed to grab as many as possible in less than five minutes.

12/13/2021,"Alex was studying transport management in Boston when he first came across Amanda in 2001. They belonged to the same internet forum for railway enthusiasts. “At the time it was a hobby dominated by men and a lot of women who did join disguised themselves,” says Alex. “I remember seeing Amanda’s name and thinking it was great that she could be herself.” There was an AOL chatroom within the message board, and they began to talk. A New Yorker, Amanda had always been interested in transport systems. For several years they chatted online, but neither expected it to turn into more. “She was dating a subway operator and I told her to be careful because the railroad life can be really tough,” he says.  By 2006, Amanda had embarked on a career in business journalism. Alex was working for an engineering contractor and travelling regularly from Boston to New York to look for secure jobs. Both were single. One day in early 2007, Alex asked her permission to flirt. “When he asked if he could hit on me I was a bit taken aback, but thought: ‘why not?’” says Amanda. Alex was “actively seeking a new partner” and keen to explore whether their friendship might develop into more. Amanda began to dig deeper into his interests. “He was very intriguing,” she says. “I’d only lived in New York and he was such a worldly person. He had been living all over the world and had interesting stories to tell.” After years of chatting online, they agreed to meet that spring outside K Mart in Penn station, New York, for a day out. “We rode the subway down to Coney Island and walked around,” says Amanda. “I took him on the Staten Island ferry and we rode around on the railway there.” Alex was impressed by her fearlessness. “I had only lived in smaller cities and was a bit intimidated by some parts of New York.” A few weeks later, he drove his rickety 1988 Volvo down to visit her again and she showed him around Long Island, where she lived. They became a long-distance couple, until Alex accepted a job with the New York Transit Authority in July 2007. “I was living at home with my mum and grandmother and asked if he wanted to be a lodger,” says Amanda. For Alex, it was a leap into the unknown and the adjustment wasn’t easy. “I’d lived on my own for so long that I struggled,” he says. “Amanda seemed more family-oriented.” Six months later, Alex moved out again and the couple took a break from the relationship. They stayed friends and met now and again for dinner. But by 2009, they slowly began to realise they wanted to be together. “I could tell we both felt we should make it work,” says Amanda. That September, Alex invited Amanda to meet him at Penn station where they first met. She was expecting a friendly dinner and was shocked when he proposed. “He pulled out an origami box he had made out of metro cards. I was so busy looking at the pretty box it took me ages to open it,” she says, laughing. “We hadn’t discussed it, but I knew it was right so I said yes.” In 2010, they focused on travelling, and then bought a home of their own in 2013 – the day before their wedding. Their children were born in 2017 and 2020. “Alex has made my life so much more adventurous,” says Amanda. “He’s expanded my horizons and I didn’t realise how insular my world was before I met him.” In turn, Alex says Amanda makes him a better person. “She has helped me to develop my emotional intelligence. I’ve grown as a person and I don’t think anyone else could have done that. We are always finding out new things about each other.” Want to share your story?

12/13/2021,"One of the most quietly significant games of the 00s has been transformed here into a visually incredible, endlessly rewarding dark fantasy. Make your way through imposing medieval castles, a horrendous prison tower and foul swamps using a sword, shield, wand and whatever else you can scavenge to defend yourself against what you find there. This game can be brutal and unforgiving – progress is hard-won, the combat is exciting and consequential, and the bosses are legendary – but you can always summon other players to help you, and if you can engage with its challenge, this is a game you’ll never forget.  You’ve crash-landed on a hostile planet full of fascinating and dangerous creatures that look and sound like something out of an Alex Garland movie. You make your way tentatively through jungles, deserts and ancient structures, finding better guns and trying not to be unceremoniously slaughtered by everything you meet. When you inevitably die, you do it all again, right from the start. Returnal might not sound like fun and yes, it does require commitment, but it’s just so thrilling to play that living out the same time-loop again doesn’t seem like a chore. Plus, the further you get into the game, the cleverer it turns out to be. Read the review. A stylish, moreish and unexpectedly sexy game in which you try to fight your way out of the Greek underworld as Zagreus, son of Hades. The ingredients are simple – a few different weapons, various perks from all the gods of Olympus rooting for your escape, snappy and intelligent dialogue – but they combine into something different and interesting, and with every attempt you edge closer to the surface. Its memorable, playful take on mythology helps make this the best game in its genre. Read the review. Developer Arkane Studios brings so much style and aesthetic confidence to its games, they’re a pleasure just to witness and exist in – and Deathloop is no exception. An exuberant, super chaotic action adventure set in a degrading time-loop on an island inhabited solely by sociopathic rich people, this game boasts smooth gunplay, wild locations and narrative chicanes that have you gripping the proverbial safety bar in disbelief. However will this talented team follow it? Read the review. An absolutely joyful game about a lonely space-rodent, his robot pal, and a supervillain crisis that has him meeting his dimensional twin and going on a galaxy-spanning adventure with her. Whether you are pointing cartoonish weapons at wonderfully animated alien enemies or leaping and skating around alien planets on jet-boots, it always looks absolutely sumptuous and wants you to be having a good time. It’s technically astonishing, sure, but also big-hearted, lovable and very, very fun to play. Read the review. Set in Japan in the 1200s and hugely informed and inspired by samurai cinema, this is the most absurdly beautiful open-world game around. Just watch the cherry blossoms fall and grass blow in the wind as you ride around the island of Tsushima and slash through Mongol invaders. Its action wears thin after a while, but nonetheless this is a game that shows off both the PlayStation 5 and developer Sucker Punch’s superabundant attention to visual detail. Read the review. Building on the acclaimed 2020 update of Square Enix’s classic steampunk adventure, Intergrade tweaks the visuals for PS5 and adds the Episode INTERmission content, which brings in a whole new quest around fan-favourite character Yuffie. It’s wonderful to see well-known locations around Midgar lavishly redecorated for the new console, and for those who have never previously encountered the original game or the remake, my goodness, what a treat you have in store. Read the review. A co-operative adventure about a failing marriage doesn’t sound like the stuff of gaming magic, but Hazelight Studios has brought startling innovative flair to what could have been a mawkish trial. Arguing parents May and Cody are shrunk down to toy size and have to fight their way through their own home and garden to reach their daughter, fighting giant instincts and working together to solve clever, engrossing puzzles (and these are truly collaborative ventures, not just one player standing on a switch, while the other opens a door). Ultimately, this is a game about the value of communication and beyond the annoying talking book narrator, it delivers its marriage guidance in the subtlest of ways. Read the review. The PlayStation 5’s first game is still one of its best, an exuberant tribute to PlayStation history, hardware and games that is effortlessly likable. You can get through it in an evening, but in those few hours you’ll use the controller to climb mountains as a robot monkey, fire arrows at a dragon made of stone and zip around an imaginative dreamworld of twisted-together cable trees and platforms made of disc trays. Plus, the music will be playing in your head for weeks. Read the review. Somehow, Insomniac Games took the same city, the same mechanics and the same hero as its original Spider-Man game and made everything feel totally rejuvenated via its fresh leading man. Miles’s story of uncertainty, vulnerability and gaining strength through experience is truly moving, and the way New York City reflects his very different journey – the neighbourhoods he frequents and the people he meets – is so skilfully and subtly done. But this is also a kick-ass action game with enough new moves and cool set-pieces to entertain and challenge veteran webslingers. It also looks astonishing on PS5.
