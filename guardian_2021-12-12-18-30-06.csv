12/12/2021,"If disaster strikes in the theatre, an understudy replaces a leading actor, sometimes even during the interval. Audiences adapt and occasionally a star is born. Yet performers, on stage or screen, are still seen as the last people who should be asking for flexible working. Instead they are expected to give their all, until their all gives in. Now, calls to allow job-sharing among casts, as well as for members of the backstage crew, are growing louder, in an attempt to make entertainment a better working environment. Leading the campaign are many new mothers, who argue there is no real reason why the burden of long hours and late evenings cannot be borne by two pairs of shoulders.  “People are really responding to this. The idea of sharing is now really hitting a nerve,” said the actor Naomi Sheldon, who has been splitting the role of Adrianna in the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) production of The Comedy of Errors at the Barbican in London with fellow actor Hedydd Dylan. “I was quite tentative about it all,” said Sheldon, “but the whole thing has been an absolute dream.” Dylan played the role of a pregnant Adrianna in Stratford upon Avon and on tour. She then shared the part with Sheldon, before stepping down in November before the birth of her son. “I was nervous at first about how Hedydd would feel about the arrangement,” recalls Sheldon. “But having been an understudy to Hayley Atwell before, I knew that whatever my own take on the role might be, I needed to fit in. “This was not a production I had helped to shape, so I made sure I knew where I had to be to hit my marks on the stage. “Luckily for me, Hedydd turned out to be a class act,” added Sheldon. When the play’s director, Phillip Breen, learned Dylan was pregnant, he decided to make her character pregnant to match, allowing the actor to stay in the role throughout the run at Stratford upon Avon and on tour. “It worked rather well,” said Breen. “It raises the stakes between Adrianna and Antipholus of Ephesus and accounts for some of the complexities in their relationship, but also, ultimately, their great bond, too. It also gives an added dimension to the family reunion at the end.” Sheldon found the tight stage choreography and strict discipline on a production she describes as a “slick farce” helped her find her way, as she navigated her arrival in the cast. It soon became clear, though, that she could not just copy Dylan’s comic techniques. “We are very different creatures,” she said. “Hedydd is tall and elegant, with a lot of natural status on stage, while I’m shorter and have an erratic energy about me. Some of the cast have described it by saying that Hedydd’s portrayal of Adrianna is “like a lolloping greyhound” where as I am “more of a persistent terrier”. So, even if I’d wanted to do a version of Hedydd’s performance, I wouldn’t have been able.” Sheldon took over the role full-time last month after Dylan left ahead of the birth of her son. As a new parent of a baby girl and boy, Sheldon said she “never would’ve believed I would be able to play a demanding lead role at the RSC at this stage”, adding: “And when my babies were small, while we were sharing, I was able to spend the first half of the week at home with my babies.” “I felt proud that other actresses in a similar position might be encouraged and inspired by my experience and hopefully feel less frightened of the prospect of juggling an acting career and having a baby,” Dylan told the Observer. The RSC was following in the footsteps of Chichester Festival Theatre, which allowed the central role of Nellie Forbush in the musical South Pacific to be shared by the actors Gina Beck and Alex Young in the summer. Beck, who played the Rodgers and Hammerstein role until late August, said then she hoped the theatre’s “trailblazing attitude” would spread across the industry: “When carrying my first child I became unemployable and was unpaid for six months because I looked, well … pregnant.” Among other performers pushing for better working practices for families is the actor Romola Garai. Garai, who has just written and directed the horror film Amulet, out next month, remains determined to campaign for more production companies in theatre, film and television to let cast and crew share their workloads. Speaking to the Observer a few years ago, Garai said: “The liberal industries are seen as so lefty, but that masks the unbelievable backwardness of our employment practices – it’s terrible for carers and parents. I recently asked for a four-day week for the first time and I was laughed at.” Championing these arguments is the organisation Raising Films, which offers screen industry employers a checklist of tools to improve hiring practices. “It’s tough out there for independent producers putting teams together, but we’re facing such a massive skills shortage that we do need to be thinking of better ways to bring in and retain talent,” said Raising Films’ co-founder Nicky Bentham, a producer at Neon Films. “Not every role or every production is going to suit a job sharing scenario, but I think there’s probably more room for it than people might suspect.” Raising Films also runs a website that links workers to job sharing schemes, including the Media Parents, the union Bectu’s TakeTwo, and Share My Telly Job (SMTJ), set up by Louise Patel in 2015. Patel argues that inflexibility in television production means talented people leave the industry, or get stuck in roles below their skill level. It is a sadly limited attitude, she believes, in contrast with entertainment’s premium on creative thinking. Job sharing, Raising Films contends, also helps avoid the burnout that can hamper a career, and it builds in holiday cover for anxious employers. SMTJ’s co-director, Michelle Reynolds, compares a good job share to a marriage. “Trust and communication are key, as inevitably there will come a day when your job share partner makes a decision you do not agree with. You have to have a level of respect for that person to see their choice as equally valid.” SMTJ, Reynolds explains, was born out of frustration at the struggle to get back to work following the birth of children. The campaign was spurred on by reports of the huge drop-out rate of women working in television production. As a result, this year they created The Time Project, which is an industrywide way of recording hours for everyone working off-screen in British TV. “There is a myth that people who want to work flexibly are less committed to the job than their full-time counterparts. To that we say, no one will want the job share to succeed more than the job sharers themselves, as it is their key to staying in the career they love,” said Reynolds.",Arts/Stage,It’s a family show: actors with new babies job-share leading roles,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/dec/12/its-a-family-show-actors-with-new-babies-job-share-leading-roles
12/12/2021,"An investigation to locate so-called “ghost children” who have fallen off the radar during the pandemic is to be launched by England’s children’s commissioner, the Observer can reveal, amid growing concerns over their welfare. In an intervention further highlighting the concerns over the whereabouts of tens of thousands of children, Rachel de Souza said she would immediately begin an exhaustive inquiry to find missing students in 10 areas to assess why they have disappeared from official view.  She said it was part of a “call to arms” to tackle persistent absences since the pandemic began. She warned that the horrendous case of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, the six-year-old who was tortured to death by his stepmother and father in June last year, had injected further urgency into solving the problem. Some estimates have suggested that as many as 100,000 children are at risk of abuse after failing to return to school following the schools lockdown last year. Persistent absence increased to 16.3% in secondary schools in autumn 2020, compared with 15% in 2019, not including non-attendance because of Covid issues. De Souza told the Observer she feared a lack of provision for children with special educational needs was pushing them out of school, with pupils facing bullying and mental health problems. “We’re hearing lots of things about ‘ghost children’,” she said. “I hate that term. These are real flesh-and-blood children. We should be able to find out where every child in England is. We should be making sure they are in school or high-quality education. “Arthur’s case was heartbreaking. We have to wait for the serious case review, but you can’t help asking yourself: if we hadn’t been locked down, or had we been able to ensure he was in school, would we have been able to stop this? This weekend, I really reflected. We must do everything we can for safeguarding purposes to make sure children are in school, particularly the most vulnerable. There is no reason in 2021 why we shouldn’t be able to find out where every child is, and make sure they are in school, getting a decent education.” The 10 local authority areas to be investigated are currently being identified. De Souza said she would use her statutory powers to carry out the probe if necessary, but that all initial conversations suggested councils and other local institutions would cooperate. It comes after Ofsted’s chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, warned that ministers have “no handle” on who the missing children are or where they are. She said school absences had led to significant fall in the numbers of referrals to social care, potentially putting more children at risk of abuse. Spielman has called for an official register of children who are not attending school. De Souza said her office had received a huge amount of testimony from children not at school and their parents, which suggests that lack of mental health provision remains one cause behind absences. One 15-year-old boy said he had been on a mental health waiting list for three years. A 16-year-old boy said it had taken a year to have medication prescribed to help his mental health condition, meaning he missed a year of school and crucial exams. “If I was two years older I would have had some of the help I needed straight away, and may have not got into such a downward spiral,” he said. There is also evidence that a lack of provision for special educational needs is combining with mental health issues to fuel the problem. “My ADHD and the lack of support I have received over the years has made my mental health decline seriously,” said a 17-year-old boy not in school. “I am at risk and am worrying my family a lot.” Some children talked about the impact of bullying. One 13-year-old said he was “homeschooled due to being bullied at my secondary school”. Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, said his department had now set up a new “attendance alliance” designed to bring together the key figures able to tackle the problem of missing school children. “They will be working over the coming months to make sure everyone working on the ground with children, as a teacher, football coach, mental health worker or in any other role, has the tools and resources they need to break down barriers to children attending school,” he said. “I welcome the children’s commissioner’s support with this work and will continue to prioritise taking action to make sure children have the opportunity to spend time in class with inspirational teachers and good friends – simply because it is the single most powerful tool at our disposal to make sure every child fulfils their potential.”",News/Society,Hunt launched to find ‘ghost children’ missing from schools in England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/12/hunt-launched-to-find-ghost-children-missing-from-schools-in-england
12/12/2021,"Twitter has an unfortunate reputation as the punchbag of social media. It has failed to deliver the huge returns of bigger rivals such as Facebook and Facebook-owned Instagram, it hasn’t been the cool new network for more than a decade and even its own most dedicated users love to drag it to oblivion.  Investors have been similarly wary of the 300m-strong social network – it has lagged behind rivals in terms of features, revenue per user and for monetisation tools. Lots of people rely on Twitter to make at least part of their income, but tend to monetise it off the network, with no cut for Twitter. That might be starting to change. Twitter is trialling a “super follow” feature for people to support users they particularly like on the site, has bought the newsletter platform Revue and is integrating that with Twitter and has also bought up some other monetisation tools. With the departure of its part-time chief executive and co-founder Jack Dorsey, Twitter might be worth a second look in 2022. If you managed to avoid any mention of NFTs – short for non-fungible tokens – online in 2021, you spend your time in far less nerdy corners of the internet than we do. Non-fungible essentially means that one token isn’t identical to the next one. So for a cryptocurrency, one bitcoin is no different from another bitcoin. For an NFT, each token is unique. That means NFTs have become popular as a way to record blockchain “ownership” of a particular piece of digital art or memorabilia. These have included clips of NBA scoring shots, gorilla avatars and generative art. Advocates say the ability to own digital art enables people to make ongoing creative work from the NFT they own, perhaps using it as the art for their company logo, adding it to existing intellectual property or even making a Gorillaz-style NFT avatar band. Sceptics here note that all of this was and is possible without any use of NFTs at all: it is what intellectual property rights already exist to enable, after all. In practice, owning an NFT only proves you own the NFT – an entry on a blockchain somewhere saying you “own” whatever it links to. That may or may not be true legally, depending on how scrupulous the seller was. If people are buying NFTs and driving up the price because they truly value the artworks on offer, then the gold rush could prove sustainable. If people are buying them solely because they think someone else will buy one for more, lots of people will lose big. One special thing to watch out for, for buyers and sellers alike, is platform fees. These can amount to hundreds of dollars – do remember the house always wins. The delivery economy – and transport economy – is as big as it ever was, with home delivery of restaurant food and groceries still on the high it reached during the pandemic and demand for Uber-style transport up 20% to 40% on pre-pandemic levels. The problem is that it doesn’t seem to be any more profitable for the companies offering the service than it was beforehand. Uber upped its prices by 10% in London, but is still struggling to recruit drivers and in the UK it is 20,000 drivers short of what it would need to meet demand. Alongside that, even though it is showing a tiny “adjusted” paper profit, it is still burning through hundreds of millions in cash. The companies have new competition for labour too, in the form of a flurry of 10-minute grocery delivery startups, including Getir, Weezy and several more. Each of these is offering hefty discounts and cheap delivery to try to secure more customers than their rivals and so will be burning through cash at an alarming rate. Expect several of these to fail or to merge before 2022 is out. Former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey had been fairly obviously bored with his creation for some time, not least because his other company – the payments processor Square – has a valuation several times higher. If the subtle clues of Dorsey’s rare tweets largely being pro-blockchain hype and the fact of him owning a payments company weren’t enough, in the last weeks of 2021 Dorsey renamed the company Block. So, expect Jack Dorsey to launch a new blockchain-related subsidiary quite early in 2022 and don’t be surprised if Silicon Valley enfant terrible Peter Thiel invests – Thiel co-founded PayPal with the aim of breaking fiat currency and government control of money, so the appeal of blockchain as it hits maturity cannot be lost on him. This time last year, Spacs – short for special purpose acquisition companies – were the talk of the town. Spacs were a trick to help get your company publicly listed without the drawn-out, costly and risky process of an initial public offering (IPO). A company would be created, raise money and then look for a startup to merge with, skipping lots of regulatory steps. People feared it would undermine safeguards designed to protect regular investors. From now, though, Spacs feel like they’ve had their moment. While several startups, including BuzzFeed, went public via Spac in 2021, most of them underperformed the market and many lost money outright, meaning startups are eyeing up IPOs once again. The hot abbreviation as we enter 2022 then is DAO – short for decentralised autonomous organisation. DAOs, which generally use their own cryptocurrency to create a one-coin, one-vote democracy, raise money and seek to use it for some agreed purpose. One recently tried but failed to buy a copy of the US constitution, leading to an almighty row over refunds when it failed. Advocates see DAOs as the forefront of a new, democratised internet. Sceptics see a waste of time and effort, only an illusion of decentralisation, and big risks to naive investors not sure of the risks involved, or of the steep transaction fees. It’s possible both groups are right. The danger once anyone in technology starts using the phrases “immersive” or “living your life online” is that it’s almost inevitably followed by someone trying to make you wear a headset – and there’s no reason to believe Facebook’s attempt to push us on to the metaverse wearing their Oculus headsets will be any different. Users have generally avoided virtual reality. Heavy headsets, motion sickness, the poor content and the utter nerdiness of VR put almost everyone off. But with the metaverse, an immersive internet that we are assured will work properly this time, being big tech’s new fixation, expect to see a new flurry of VR hype very soon. This year was another banner year for indie gaming, with even notable indie flop No Man’s Sky, which drew widespread criticism on launch, now being acclaimed after turning itself around. Find-and-murder-your-friends indie Among Us became a huge lockdown hit, while Garden Story, Sable, Valheim and more broke through. Expect to see a similar slew of strong titles as the sector enjoys its renaissance in 2022. It’s safe to go back into your podcast app again. All those homemade lockdown podcasts launched by everyone’s boyfriend have deservedly withered on the vine and the state of podcast output is better than ever. Major professional broadcasters and production houses are making high-budget series, there is still a bustling indie scene and podcasting has found a voice beyond “two men in a shed”. The output is more diverse in terms of content and who’s behind the mic than with old media, and the monetisation is now working. Podcasts are a success story and we should take the win. On the face of it, newsletters are enjoying a similar triumph, but here there are clouds on the horizon. Most of the top-table Substacks aren’t successful because they’re a counter to the culture wars, they’re successful because they fuel it. Substack hasn’t proved an escape from Twitter for authors, it has become an incentive to have Twitter beef and drive more subscriptions. A bigger problem is the price. If you subscribe to one newsletter, £4.99 a month or so seems reasonable. At four or five, you’re paying three or four times more for newsletters than you would for the New York Times. People are trimming their subs and wondering aloud whether there could be, say, a merged subscription at a lower price for numerous letters. Perhaps we could call it… a magazine? Finally, in the greatest U-turn since whatever Boris Johnson reversed himself on last week, Apple has done something it hasn’t in decades: it has added ports back on to its new MacBook Pro. After trimming them all the way down to simply two USB-C ports and a headphone jack, the new Pros have an HDMI port and even an SD card reader. We really are back to the future.",News/Technology,"Ten tech predictions for 2022: what’s next for Twitter, Uber and NFTs",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/12/10-tech-predictions-for-2022-twitter-uber-nfts-virtual-reality
12/12/2021,"Writing is a long-distance sport. And lonely. Many’s the night or early morning I’ve been closed in my office, working on a longer project and feeling the weight that no one but me can tippety tap those words out. But it’s also a time of discovery. This is when I look for inspiration among chocolate bars. The past few weeks some of Aurosó’s Sunrise Florins (left, £8, 75g) have been keeping me company. I love the delicious crisp of the very dark chocolate (90%) topped with sour cherries, blackberries and granola – that’s a concentrating treat. When the words won’t come and I have needed comfort, solace and a bit of ‘there, there’, this has been found in Pump Street’s wonderful, buttery, limited-edition 62% Croissant Bar (I know: genius!) (£6.25, 70g), which has croissant not only blended into the chocolate but flaked in, to provide something extraordinary. (Not chocolate but if you do order via the PS website, slip a box of eccles cakes, £15 for six, into your basket, they are superb.)  For the home stretch – when I’ve broken the back of the piece – Chocolate Detective’s Silver Ox (a play on silver fox) 61% dark milk (£6.95, 70g). This is an unassuming-looking chocolate that yet deserves wider recognition as a very fine, high-cocoa content milk indeed. But that glorious moment when the piece is over, it’s done and I feel podium triumphant, I’ve indulged in Tosier’s exquisite – you really have to try them – limited-edition Freddy Rocks (£12, 150g); a softly crunchy hazelnut and feuilletine filling, richly swirled in 70% Haiti chocolate.",Lifestyle/Food,Chocs that have a soft touch | Annalisa Barbieri,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/dec/12/chocs-that-have-a-soft-touch
12/12/2021,"Lying. Refusing to follow rules. Mocking the little people. Deflecting any blame. Not just this government’s response to a Christmas party that “never took place”, but the response of successive governments to the issue of fire safety in buildings. Where the former reveals the depth of hypocrisy and contempt within elite circles, the latter exposes a culture of impunity that has had deadly consequences. Last week, the Grenfell Tower inquiry began its final phase in which it will investigate the role of government policy. Jason Beer, QC for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, declared the department “deeply sorry for its past failures” that had helped create “an environment in which such a tragedy was possible”.  For all the contrition, it was a fauxpology, an exercise in deflecting blame rather than in accepting responsibility. According to Beer, the government had erred in failing to recognise that building inspectors “would not diligently fulfil their responsibilities” and in putting “misplaced trust” in companies and contractors, a trust that had been “abused”. The real villains of the story, in other words, were building inspectors and private contractors; the government’s failure was in imagining that they would act as nobly as it itself would. It was another “it wasn’t a party, it was cheese and wine” moment, but no one was laughing. Inspectors, manufacturers and contractors have much to answer for. But far from being too “trusting”, governments have at best permitted, at worst encouraged, their practices. Successive administrations, Stephanie Barwise QC, counsel for bereaved families, told the inquiry, have viewed deadly fires “as something to be covered up or trivialised”, allowing “industry the latitude it wanted”. The story of the failures that led to Grenfell goes back at least 30 years to the Knowsley Heights fire of 1991. A block of flats in Huyton, Merseyside, Knowsley Heights had been chosen as a pilot for the government’s “Estates Action Programme” to reclad old, deteriorating estates using “Class 0” material. The debate around Class 0 is complex, but it is in essence material that is often taken to be fire-resistant but is not. As early as 1986, a Department of the Environment circular warned that “a risk of increased vertical fire spread has been identified during the laboratory testing of overcladding systems”. The warning was ignored. A fire broke out in Knowsley Heights just as predicted. Instead of learning the lessons, the authorities sought to hush up the findings. Inside Housing magazine unearthed a handwritten memo from the Building Research Establishment (BRE), the national research laboratory, which noted “a request” from the government press office “to play down the issue of the fire”. The BRE report on the Knowsley fire was kept for “limited circulation”. One reason, Barwise suggested, might have been the desire to avoid the expense of fixing combustible cladding. At that time, the cost was estimated at £500m. Today, it stands at more than £15bn. Eight years later, a fire at Garnock Court, a block of flats in Irvine, Scotland, covered in cladding similar to that in Knowsley Court, led to a death. The BRE report into the fire did not even mention the cladding. A Commons select committee investigating Garnock Court recommended that all cladding systems be required to be “entirely non-combustible” or, at least, “proven through full-scale testing not to pose an unacceptable level of risk”. It added ominously: “We do not believe that it should take a serious fire in which many people are killed before all reasonable steps are taken towards minimising the risks.” The then-Labour government ignored the recommendation. A series of fires in other newly clad buildings followed, the most serious of which, before Grenfell, was at Lakanal House, in south London, in 2009, in which six people died. The government refused to make public its report into the fire, so as to “avoid giving the impression that we believe all buildings of this construction are inherently unsafe”. At the coroner’s inquest, it was revealed that Southwark council had carried out no fire safety checks at Lakanal or any other residential block, even though it had done so for buildings in which its own staff worked. The coroner’s recommendation for the government to review building guidance on cladding was, once more, ignored. Again, a Commons select committee, under the chairmanship of the late David Amess, took up the case, pressing the government to learn the lessons of Lakanal. Again, they were contemptuously ignored by a succession of ministers. “Should a major fire tragedy with loss of life occur… where the matters raised here were found to be contributory to the outcome, then the group would be bound to bring this to others’ attention,” Amess wrote in desperation to one minister, the Liberal Democrat Stephen Williams. He received no reply. “The consistent pattern of inadequate investigation and suppression of reports from Knowsley to… Lakanal goes beyond mere accident and involves government collusion,” Barwise observed. The actions of post-2010 administrations, with their mania for deregulation, obsession with cost-cutting and unbridled celebration of the profit motive, led government to “becoming the junior partner in the relationship” with the construction industry, thereby “permitting industry’s exploitation of the regulations”. And exploit it they did, scamming tests and selling materials they knew could kill. Since the Grenfell fire, the four biggest construction companies involved in the cladding disaster have collectively posted profits of £4.9bn, while their chief executives have pocketed nearly £50m in pay and perks. “Within the construction industry,” Beer told the inquiry, “there was a race to the bottom, with profits being prioritised over safety.” What he didn’t mention was the role of the government in permitting this. The state has, in recent decades, deliberately outsourced authority and power to independent organisations and private corporations, hollowing itself out, and refusing to take seriously its responsibility to the public. Even now, the government’s failure to meet the challenge of the cladding scandal, forcing individual leaseholders to face the ruinous consequences themselves, reveals how little attitudes have changed at the top. The collusion of politicians, regulators and corporations in permitting practices they knew were unsafe and could lead to mass death is one of the major scandals of our time. If only it would receive as much attention, and cause as much political turmoil, as a Christmas party at No 10.

12/12/2021,"ALeeds-based firm of solicitors that has been acting on behalf of a debt company has caused an outcry after sending out letters claiming that the recipients had outstanding debts to the energy supplier E.ON. Numerous recipients have contacted us, and, since last weekend, the Trustpilot page of BW Legal has been inundated with people reporting they have received requests for unpaid energy bills for properties they say they weren’t living in at the time. Some said they had never had an E.ON account.  Observer Cash understands the mailout featured three separate letters. One, headed E.ON, says that the recipient owes the debt for an unpaid gas and electricity bill. A second letter says the debt has been bought by Barnsley-based PRAC Financial, and the third that PRAC is represented by BW Legal. In one, seen by the Observer, the recipient is told by E.ON: “We have not been made aware of any valid reason why the balance has not been paid” and later warned that an account “may be generated” at a credit reference agency and the outstanding balance recorded on it. The second letter from PRAC adds: “We therefore strongly urge you to take this opportunity to speak with BW Legal about how they can assist you in managing repayment of your outstanding liability.” Rafael Heeb, a PhD student from Bristol, is one of those sent a letter. It stated that there was a balance due of £198, which would be reduced to £49 if he accepted a “pre-approved 75% discount”. Having spent hours on the phone to E.ON, he says he was told that the “debt” had been sold by E.ON to PRAC. However, the energy firm told him that it had been registered to the “occupier” of another flat in the same building as his. “I am not sure how BW Legal and PRAC managed to link my name with this account,” he says. “I have been told they have my personal details from the credit referencing agency TransUnion – yet looking at my TransUnion search history no such search from a company associated with the two companies in question can be found.” He adds: “I need to prove to them that I am not liable for this bill. But why should I? I happen to be an E.ON customer, my bills are up to date and my account in credit. This has caused me a huge amount of distress .” Other people sent the letters have reported the same experience, with some claiming the bills referred to addresses they had once lived in, but had left with no debts. The Trustpilot reviews suggest many are furious to have been contacted. Observer reader Simon Jones says he had received the same letter regarding a property he used to rent. “The period of the debt is after we moved out, the account number isn’t mine, and I can only assume BW and PRAC have linked me to my current address.” “The letters refer to credit reports etc,” he adds. “I’ve had no contact from E.ON in the preceding five and a half years since we left the property - we settled the account at the time and my credit report shows the account to be satisfied.” BW calls itself the UK’s largest independent law firm specialising in debt recovery services, and has built a multi-million-pound business, employing 250 people. In a statement BW Legal questioned the credibility of the reviews published on Trustpilot. It said in a statement: “Prior to writing to customers, our client (PRAC) has made enquiries with bureaus to trace (and verify) the occupants that were resident at the supply addresses at the time the energy was supplied. “If the customers did not reside at the property between the periods specified, they simply need to contact us and we will resolve this with them. The matter would be closed and that customer will no longer be contacted in relation to the debt.” E.ON says: “Following our own extensive attempts to collect the debt we were owed, we have passed on the debt owed to a third party, in this case BW Legal. “We have legitimately passed BW Legal the relevant property details and they have undertaken their own checks to identify people who they believe owe the debt. “However, anyone who believes they have been contacted in error and does not owe the debt should contact BW Legal, so that they can remove their details from the debt.” Some recipients of the letters have said they plan to report the matter to the Information Commissioner’s Office, believing that their data has been misused. Others say they plan to contact the Solicitors Regulation Authority. BW Legal says customers are entitled to contact regulatory bodies as they wish. It adds: “We are not disregarding any enquiries from customers, rather, we are proactively working with them to reach amicable solutions.”",Lifestyle/Money,Law firm for debt company pursues customers for E.ON bills on homes they weren’t living in,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/dec/12/law-firm-for-debt-company-pursues-customers-for-eon-bills-on-homes-they-werent-living-in
12/12/2021,"Best known as the jazz-facing guitarist in the influential Chicago post-rock outfit Tortoise, Parker, now based in LA, wears many berets: band leader, film composer, unstarry collaborator. Parker’s third solo album for the International Anthem label is a meditative gem that breaks with the more fully fleshed out style of his two previous outings. The New Breed (2016) memorialised Parker’s late father; last year’s Suite for Max Brown was dedicated to his mother, Maxine. This year’s Forfolks does away with collaborators in favour of self-quoting loops and minimal solo guitar – impressionistic daubings of notes playing out in the space between jazz, ambient and the daily practice of quietly sketching out a tune for oneself.  There are deconstructed takes here on standards My Ideal and Thelonious Monk’s Ugly Beauty, both suffused with inquiring, beatless calm. The closing track, La Jetée, circles back to Jetty by Tortoise (1998) and Isotope 217’s iteration (1997).

12/12/2021,"Ifirst came across Shirley when I was elected to parliament in the spring of 1966, two years after she became an MP. I didn’t know her well for years, but later we became close. I think Shirley was the most empathetic person I’ve ever met in my life. It’s a quality I’m rather good at judging because I don’t have it myself! You’d watch her work a room at a local Labour event and she’d never start by smarming up to a regional leader or a councillor. She’d settle down next to somebody who she’d have no political reason to talk to – a solid party worker – and you’d watch this person’s face light up. This was always done spontaneously, without any ulterior motives. She just liked people and liked them to like her. She treated all people as if they had something important to say. She also had no side to her at all and that is why she was so hugely popular and loved by Labour moderates. It was also why Labour women just revered her and many of them, who sustained the Labour party through difficult times – and some still do – would have voted for her as SDP leader of the SDP.  This was one of the reasons why Shirley from beginning to end was my choice for leader. The eventual leader, Roy Jenkins, had already been rejected by the Labour party [in the 1976 leadership election, coming third behind James Callaghan and Michael Foot]. He had few of the characteristics that would pull Labour people to us. Shirley did. She had been a member of the Labour party’s national executive committee, where she was very tough on the undemocratic left. She had proved herself a doughty fighter. The conversations that came to a head to create the SDP began on the first day of the Labour party conference in Blackpool in September 1980, in her hotel room. The mood was doom-laden – it had become clear that in almost every controversial area of policy the trade union votes were lined up with the Militant tendency for the biggest lurch to the left in Labour’s history. Shirley was right to remind people that there could be a “fascism of the left” – that was her phrase and a good one. She had all the qualifications to be leader of the SDP, but she didn’t want to do it. I knew she was having challenges in her personal life, though that had not stopped her breaking away from Labour. She was trying to get her marriage [to philosopher Bernard Williams, who had left her in 1971; she was a Roman Catholic] annulled at the time by the pope, so I knew she had a lot on. But had she been leader, I think most of the predictable attacks on the new party would have held little weight with millions of voters and I have no doubt that in the 1983 election we could have taken more votes than the Labour party. Margaret Thatcher’s kind of female leadership was also something lots of people didn’t like – and I think this might have pushed people to vote for a woman like Shirley. The SDP in its first year on its own was polling well ahead of the Liberals; above all because as our pollsters told us we were seen as a new party. By forming the SDP, we were choosing to deal with the Labour party’s internal problems in this way; had the SDP got ot 40 to 50 seats, we could have come back into some sort of arrangement with the Labour party. I think we’d have been able to do that with a decent Labour leader, like John Smith. Shirley could have helped us do that. Shirley and I progressively fell out over merging the SDP with the Liberals (I stayed with the SDP; she went with the Liberal Democrats). We weren’t in touch for years. Then in August 2006, Shirley, by then a Liberal Democrat peer, invited herself to our house in Greece. We were surprised but delighted. She said she was writing her autobiography and wanted to hear my side of the story. This again shows the mark of her. She also talked to my wife, Debbie, a literary agent, about various aspects of the book. With our feet dangling over the side of the dock in the Greek sea, Shirley and I started to discuss the past. I asked her bluntly why she did not stand in the Warrington byelection in 1981 (the first SDP seat that could have been won; Jenkins narrowly lost it), then did not contest the leadership in 1982 – I had helped get support together for her, but she nominated me instead. The frankness of her answer shocked me: she had lost her self-confidence to lead. She later wrote in her autobiography about how she had lost her self-confidence and had suffered quite a lot at the hands of Roy’s acolytes who had spread rumours about her being disorganised, indecisive and incapable of leadership, which had reached journalists. I was appalled. Here was this highly talented, empathetic, experienced politician, on the surface ambitious and self-confident, and it was not that she feared losing Warrington, but feared winning it. She was right in her book to say that I failed to recognise her lack of self-confidence back then. I was very sorry about it. But, after 2006, I am pleased to say we became friends again and she came out to Greece again in 2019, a little frail but she was still the life and soul of the household. You didn’t need to drink with Shirley around. She loved going to see the sights – she’d be plodding up the hill way ahead of me – “Oh, Shirley, I don’t want to bloody go up there” – “Oh, come on!” She was on great form and there was much laughter. We didn’t spend time on the ifs of politics at all. She was just a joy to be with.",News/Politics,Those we lost in 2021: Shirley Williams remembered by David Owen,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/12/obituaries-2021-shirley-williams-remembered-by-david-owen
12/12/2021,"When Emily first came to Paris this time last year, it was a dark day for critics in the City of Light, who dismissed it as being full of tired cliches. Now the young woman from Chicago that the French loved to hate is back for a second season of the Netflix show Emily in Paris. This time she may have a better reception from Parisians; surprisingly, they seem to be growing fond of her.  The first series was accused of swerving from one shallow stereotype to another: featuring baguettes, berets, philandering Frenchmen and, most preposterous of allly of all, spotless boulevards. Needless to say, it was a huge success: Netflix said the romantic-comedy starring Lily Collins and written and produced by Darren Star, who gave us Sex and the City, was the “most popular” of last year, a feat Rolling Stone struggled to explain for a show it described as “comically inane”. For her latest outing in the capital, the gauche twentysomething American with the deafeningly loud fashion sense is less of a plouc (peasant), and has acquired something of the French touch. And, it is hinted, a little more of the language. American author Craig Carlson, whose diner Breakfast in America in Paris’s trendy Marais district features in one of season two’s episodes, told the Observer: “I can’t tell you what they filmed in the diner because that’s top secret, but I can say they [producers] were very aware of the criticisms and are addressing them. I think I can say we will see a more mature Emily.” Carlson said he and his French husband, Julien Chameroy, were initially doubtful about the series. “I was ready to stop after the first episode; here was an American in Paris not trying to learn French or integrate, and with this American worldview. But by the end of the first season, we loved it and couldn’t wait for the second.” Chameroy said he was not at all bothered by the French stereotypes. “Frankly, if you wanted it to be more realistic, you’d have to add even more challenges for Emily. France is a hard cookie to crack and she has had an easy time of it. I’m looking forward to her having to deal with the tax office.” He added: “Look at when she’s fired, and her colleague says not to worry because nobody gets fired like that in France – it’s so true. And the love triangle line is so French. I love it. Americans come here and have this rosy, sometimes prudish vision of Paris, but here we see love and sex intertwined … that’s the real Paris.” Laurence Herszberg, founder and director of the annual Series Mania festival, which features the best of international TV shows, said: “It’s true the series portrays a fantasy Paris and an image totally removed from reality, and yes it’s clichéd. but we have to see this for what it is, a romcom and a homage to the city. Even if it was badly received by French critics, the international success of the series is great publicity for Paris.” Darren Star told Entertainment Weekly there would be more French spoken in this season, when Emily is not in the scene, and it would be subtitled. Critics roasted the first season, with reviews funnier than the show. Rolling Stone magazine declared: “If the basic premise of the show defies logic, the narcotic experience of each episode mutes it altogether, deactivating the thinking part of your brain until you’re gazing at your screen like it’s a dentist who gassed you 20 minutes ago to rip out a molar.” Carlson, however, is having none of it: “We’ve noticed 70% of our customers, who are French and American, also loved it. Not just younger people but some older women too. I don’t think anyone should take it too seriously. It’s just great fun and escapism.”",Arts/Television & radio,Paris warms to Emily as Netflix’s ingenue returns for new series,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/12/emily-in-paris-netflix-ingenue-new-series
12/12/2021,"Keir Starmer and the new shadow foreign secretary David Lammy held two hours of private talks with former US president Barack Obama last week about how centre-left parties can return to power – amid new optimism over Labour’s chances at the next election. Starmer had been due to travel to Washington to meet Obama in person but the multiple crises engulfing Boris Johnson’s government persuaded him to join the discussions by video link, while Lammy attended in person.  Lammy told the Observer that the confidential discussions with Obama and other key figures in Washington were about strategy and tactics, and formed part of an information and ideas exchange with centre-left parties that had won recent elections, including against the populist right. While not divulging Obama’s precise advice on tactics, Lammy – who would become the UK’s first black foreign secretary if Labour came to power – suggested that issues including imbalances in party funding and the media were front and centre of the discussions. “It really is about how progressive parties win and how Labour can fight back in an environment where our opponents have 10-to-one more funds than us,” Lammy said. “Obviously, in the United States there is Fox News, but we have similar challenges in the UK. Getting our message across and learning collectively is really important. We are heartened by President Biden winning in the United States and Olaf Scholz in Germany. We have got to learn the lessons, and Keir is determined that we learn winning ways. With Labour surging into a nine-point lead in Sunday’s Opinium poll for the Observer – the largest Labour advantage since 2014 recorded by Opinium – a sense of belief is beginning to build among senior Labour figures that the Tories are increasingly vulnerable. Lammy said Obama was encouraging. “He knows that things can change very much with politics. The themes and challenges are common. Progressive parties have found themselves on the back foot in a populist age, and we have to learn from each other and from colleagues who are winning.” Shortly after Joe Biden led the Democrats to victory over Donald Trump in November last year, Starmer said the US election held “stark lessons” for Labour, noting that the Democrats’ “path to victory was paved by a broad coalition, including states and communities that four years ago turned away from them.” Lammy, appointed shadow foreign secretary less than a fortnight ago in Starmer’s frontbench reshuffle, said the UK needed to return to being a respected and reliable partner on the international stage after the era of Boris Johnson. “Britain can be a force for good, but very sadly this government’s foreign policy position is built on contradictions. We have become an unreliable, inconsistent partner. The government trumpets international law but repeatedly and openly breaks it. It seeks peace in Yemen while selling arms to Saudi Arabia. You can’t promise to protect armed forces only to cut them, and slashing aid has been largely pilloried across the world. “We need to get back to being a consistent, reliable partner that puts values and human right at the centre of our place in the world. It is not about the rhetoric of global Britain or parading around on tanks, which I saw Liz Truss doing a few weeks ago as a sort of Pound Shop version of Margaret Thatcher. “These are very serious times. We have got alarm bells in Ukraine, we have got a deep and painful winter for many in Afghanistan, emerging problems in the Balkans, a rising China where there are real concerns – not just about human rights but also about the way China is aggressively treating citizens in Hong Kong, and sabre-rattling in relation to Taiwan. This is a dangerous, challenging context and we need Britain once again to be a consistent, reliable partner that befits a country that is the sixth-biggest economy in the world.” While he was clear that the UK had left the EU for good and that the matter was settled, Lammy insisted that under Labour it would build a “new relationship with the EU”, which in turn would bolster relations with Washington. On his US visit, Lammy said people were worried about Johnson’s threat to invoke article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol and the possible consequences. “Politicians have raised with me their real concern about the Good Friday agreement. It is noticed when Britain appears to be reneging on treaties and deals that it has struck. They have also noticed rising rhetoric between Boris Johnson and Emmanuel Macron. “We will build a new relationship with Europe. We are out of the EU – that is clear and that is settled. As the US increasingly looks to the Pacific and eyes issues in Asia particularly, because of China, it is even more important to our trusted special relationship with the US that we are at the centre of issues in Europe.” Lammy suggested that the UK’s best economic interests post-Brexit rested on it rebuilding close links with the EU, coupled with the pursuit of real substantial trade deals with countries outside the bloc. “Our economy has got smaller not just because of the pandemic but as a result of leaving the EU. We want to be a country where we have growth in the economy, where British businesses can prosper, where they are not tied up with red tape. And that does, of course, mean that we have got to be engaged in striking the best trade deals across the world.” Among his key priorities, he said, would be promoting UK development aid after Tory cuts, the battle against the climate crisis, and ensuring that Britain plays its part in supporting a fair shareout of vaccines to poorer countries in the continuing fight against Covid-19.",News/Politics,Obama gives tips to Starmer and Lammy on how Labour can regain ‘winning ways’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/12/barack-obama-gives-tips-to-keir-starmer-and-david-lammy-on-how-labour-can-regain-winning-ways
12/12/2021,"The number of patients stuck in hospital in England despite being medically fit to leave nearly doubled between February and November this year. The rise is worrying health experts, who say it is more evidence that the crisis in the adult care system is creating backlogs in the NHS. NHS England data shows that the number of times hospital trusts were unable to discharge a patient who no longer met the criteria to stay in hospital increased from 223,593 in February to 402,211 in November – a rise of almost 80%.  The data shows the extent of “stranded patients” – people who are clinically fit to leave hospital but cannot be discharged, often because of a lack of adult care or NHS community health provision. As a result, patients find themselves stuck in an environment where they pick up infections, while hospitals are unable to free up bed space for new admissions. The Observer has also obtained data on “delayed transfers of care” (DTOC), which measures the number of days individual patients stayed in hospital after they were ready to be discharged. NHS England stopped collecting DTOC statistics at the start of the pandemic, but a freedom of information request found 26 hospital trusts that are still recording these figures – with DTOC numbers rising by nearly 75% between February and October. Miriam Deakin, director of policy and strategy at NHS Providers, the membership body for NHS trusts, said: “Trusts do all they can to reduce delayed transfers of care, given its impact on patients. However, with the latest performance figures showing more than one in 10 beds are occupied by patients who are medically fit to leave hospital, there is a pressing need to invest in social care and care in the community. “In addition, urgent investment is needed in the social care sector including in home-care services – which is why we have called for retention payments to support people to remain within the care workforce over these critical winter months.” University Hospitals Dorset NHS Foundation Trust saw acute care DTOC numbers increase from 2,701 on 1 April to 4,452 on 1 October. DTOC cases caused by problems securing care packages at home doubled in that time, while those arising from difficulties in finding beds in community hospitals more than doubled. Dr Tristan Richardson, clinical director for medicine at University Hospitals Dorset NHS Foundation Trust, said: “If we have a patient who can’t leave hospital because a package of care is not available to support them at home, or there is not a place in a care home, for example, that means a patient can’t move from our emergency department on to a ward.” He added that this “fills up our emergency department, which in turn means other patients are waiting to enter the emergency department in ambulances, and consequently those ambulances can’t then be attending an emergency in the community. The knock-on effect presents a clear compromise to all patients.” A report from Dorset council in November described the link between the crisis in adult care and delayed discharges from hospitals: “The shortage of home care and therapy support is… having an adverse impact on the local hospitals; people are waiting for packages of care… to be available before they are discharged. Therefore increasing length of stay and decreasing hospital capacity.” The report identified “significant gaps in workforce capacity such as the lack of home care and therapy workers”, and noted that the workload of hospital social work teams had tripled but that the “workforce has not increased to match the demand”. David Fothergill, of the Local Government Association, said: “Councils and care providers are doing all they can to ensure people are able to safely return from hospital to their homes and communities as quickly as possible, despite multiple and ongoing pressures. “These include, but is not limited to, significant shortages in the social care workforces, with more than 100,000 vacancies available on any given day, and extremely high turnover rates. “Recent extra government funding for care workforce retention and recruitment will help, but this falls well short of enabling an immediate significant uplift in pay, which is the single biggest factor behind staffing shortages.” NHS England did not respond to a request for comment.",News/Society,Number of healthy patients ‘stranded’ in English hospital wards rises by 80%,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/12/number-of-healthy-patients-stranded-in-english-hospital-wards-rises-by-80
12/12/2021,"The UK government is facing a major legal challenge against its policy of prosecuting asylum seekers who steer boats across the Channel under smuggling laws. Since the start of 2020, Immigration Enforcement has brought 67 successful prosecutions related to piloting small boats. But after court challenges earlier in the year, the Crown Prosecution Service issued new guidance advising that passengers – even those who take a turn steering – are potentially vulnerable asylum seekers who should not be prosecuted.  Despite this guidance prosecutions have continued. Lawyers for several individuals jailed on smuggling charges will put their cases at the court of appeal on Tuesday, arguing that they were attempting to be rescued at sea so they could claim asylum. Clare Moseley, the director of Care for Calais, who has given evidence for recent hearings, told the Observer that the people steering boats are not criminals making money out of the crossings. “In Calais people tell us that they have to take their phone so they can call the coastguard or Border Force from the boat; these people are happy to meet the authorities – their full intention is to claim asylum. “Some migrants drive the boat in order to get a place on it because they can’t afford to pay a smuggler. These people are victims of conflicts, torture and persecution, they are not criminals.” The appeals were triggered by a case in May when an Iranian man, Fouad Kakaei, had his smuggling conviction overturned at a retrial after spending 17 months in jail. He told UK authorities he had taken the tiller to stop the boat sinking. A Home Office spokesperson said at the time: “We are deeply disappointed by today’s verdict. The government is determined to crack down on the criminals who facilitate illegal entry into the UK and put lives at risk.” After Kakaei’s verdict was overturned, the Crown Prosecution Service issued its new guidance on Channel crossing prosecutions, stating: “Recognising migrants and asylum seekers often have no choice in how they travel and face exploitation by organised crime groups, prosecutors are… asked to consider the… public interest factors in charging those merely entering illegally… Passengers of boats and other vehicles should not be prosecuted unless they are repeat offenders or have previously been deported.” Despite the new guidance, prosecutions are still going ahead. Last week 36-year-old Hammad al-Shamari was jailed for two-and-a-half years for steering a boat with 25 people, including small children, across the Channel. He is a Kuwaiti Bidoon, a group persecuted by the government and often left stateless. The prosecutions are part of a wider pattern of governments across Europe using increasingly harsh laws against migrants and refugees. In Italy police have arrested more than 2,500 people for smuggling or aiding illegal immigration since 2013, often using anti-mafia laws to bring charges. Earlier this year Boris Johnson said that the government would “ruthlessly stiffen the sentences for anybody who is involved in this kind of people smuggling and trafficking human beings across the Channel”. The nationality and borders bill that is currently making its way through parliament could make it easier to prosecute people who are crossing the Channel as well as increasing the sentence to life for the offence of assisting unlawful immigration. Tom Pursglove, minister for justice and tackling illegal migration, said after the most recent case: “Small boat pilots put the lives of everyone in their boat in mortal danger and it is right that we deter further attempts by bringing them to justice. “Our new plan for immigration will help prevent these dangerous crossings by introducing tougher penalties for those who risk people’s lives by facilitating illegal immigration.”",News/Politics,Legal challenge seeks to end UK’s jailing of asylum seekers who steer boats,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/12/legal-challenge-seeks-to-end-uks-jailing-of-asylum-seekers-who-steer-boats
