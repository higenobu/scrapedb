12/30/2021,"Reducing self-isolation to five days for positive Covid casescould increase the infection risk for vulnerable patients in hospital if the approach is not completely safe, a senior NHS leader has said. Since 22 December, people in England who test positive for Covid can cut their self-isolation period from 10 days to seven if they have a negative lateral flow test on day six and day seven and no high temperature. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have stuck with the 10-day rule.  However, pressure has been rising on the government to consider further cutting self-isolation to five days, with some experts tentatively backing the idea. It has also gathered momentum within the hospitality industry, but they still believe it is the job of scientists to ascertain the move’s safety. Now Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, has weighed into the debate, suggesting the decision is far from simple – even if it might help tackle staff absences in the NHS. “Covid-19 keeps throwing up policy decisions requiring difficult judgments between competing objectives. Reducing Covid isolation from seven days to five is another one of these,” he wrote on Twitter. In a series of tweets, Hopson noted one consideration is high staff absences due to self-isolation across the economy, including in the health service. “If staff absence rates and care quality/patient safety risk rise, pressure for a change to the isolation period will, inevitably, rise as well,” he said. However, Hopson noted that a shift to a shorter self-isolation period could be problematic if it increases the risk of hospital-acquired Covid infections. And if people do remain infectious after five days of self-isolation, there could be a rise in community infection rates – a concern given the uncertain impact of Omicron on older populations. Another issue is that there have been disruptions in the availability of lateral flow and PCR tests. “A policy based on people needing negative PCR or lateral flow test results to exit isolation requires rapid, reliable and widespread access to those tests. This is not, currently, consistently the case,” he wrote. Hopson added there is considerable debate within the scientific community as to whether, or to what degree, people with Omicron are infectious after five days. Leading figures in the hospitality industry, where festive takings have been down by as much as 60%, said a shorter isolation period could relieve some of the pressure on the struggling sector. Phil Urban, the chief executive of the 1,700-strong pub and restaurant group Mitchells & Butlers, which owns the Harvester and O’Neill’s chains, stressed that it was for the government’s scientific advisers to determine the length of the Covid isolation period. But he said a shorter gap would help the industry. “If people are isolating who are fine otherwise, the shorter the time period, the better it is. That would certainly be helpful.” The trade body UK Hospitality said a shortage of tests meant the industry was being hit by a double whammy of staff taking longer to come back to work and customers staying away. “We’re kind of agnostic [on five-day isolation] because it’s so far out of our sphere of expertise,” said the chief executive, Kate Nicholls. “It’s welcome news that they’re looking at it but we’d only want that if it was safe. We do need to make sure that we have a continued ready supply of lateral flow tests.” The US has recently announced it is moving to a five-day self-isolation period for those with Covid but no symptoms – albeit with mask-wearing for a further five days. However, some experts have criticised the move as the US does not require people to have negative Covid tests before exiting self-isolation. Lawrence Young, a virologist and professor of molecular oncology at Warwick medical school, said the time to becoming and remaining infectious varies from person to person, and by variant, with some evidence suggesting it takes only two to three days between infection and becoming infectious with Omicron. “This infectious period can occur before the onset of symptoms and last for between two and three days after you become symptomatic,” he said. Young added that the current seven-day plus testing approach adopted in the UK is sensible and provides a margin for person-to-person variability. But, he added: “Reducing the self-isolation period to five days without robust evidence is a concern and could only be introduced with the strict enforcement of lateral flow testing.” A paper by scientists at the UK Health Security Agency, yet to be peer reviewed, suggests that relying on two negative lateral flow tests alone would risk a high proportion of people being released while still infectious due to false negatives, suggesting a mandatory isolation period is also necessary. “A mandatory isolation period of longer than seven days will not provide much more safety but lowering this mandatory isolation point will increase the percent of ‘false releases’ dramatically,” said the team.",News/World news,"Cut to self-isolation period may increase Covid hospital risk, says NHS chief",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/cut-to-self-isolation-period-may-increase-covid-hospital-risk-says-nhs-chief
12/30/2021,"Though he largely escaped scrutiny in Ghislaine Maxwell’s trial, the Duke of York will not be able to dodge the spotlight in the new year when he is sued for alleged sexual assault. Prince Andrew will have been deeply relieved when his accuser, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, was not called as a witness in Maxwell’s case. But next week she is due in a New York court for the next stage of her civil action against him – a lawsuit Andrew’s lawyers will do everything to get thrown out.  She claims the Queen’s son had sex with her on three occasions two decades ago when, aged 17, she had been sexually trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein, allegations Andrew vehemently denies. Following Maxwell’s conviction on Wednesday, Giuffre said: “I hope that today is not the end but rather another step in justice being served. Maxwell did not act alone. Others must be held accountable. I have faith that they will be.” Her absence in the witness box at Maxwell’s trial was perplexing to many. Her name was introduced countless times, her photograph was shown in court and she has been one of the most prominent accusers of Epstein and Maxwell. A deposition, given by Maxwell in a 2016 civil suit brought by Giuffre, formed the basis of two perjury charges against the British socialite, who denied all charges. Giuffre was “available” if called upon to give evidence, the court heard. “Certainly, if she had been called, it would have seen Andrew centre-stage,” said Mark Stephens of the law firm Howard Kennedy. Prosecutors gave no reason for their decision. But they may have feared it would complicate the case, especially if inconsistencies could be shown in accounts Giuffre has previously given over the years. It could be, said Stephens, “that the reason the prosecution did not call Giuffre in the Ghislaine Maxwell case is that they risked an own goal if her credibility could be undermined, which would have given Maxwell a leg-up”. Andrew’s lawyers have sought to target Giuffre’s credibility as they attempt to get the case against him dismissed in the civil proceedings she has brought. His legal team has painted her as an unreliable witness, querying certain dates and figures she has provided, and accusing her of seeking another “payday”. She has previously explained any discrepancies as innocent mistakes, and the result of recalling events from many years ago that had left her traumatised. Andrew’s part in Maxwell’s courtroom drama was, therefore, reduced to mentions of him being a guest onboard Epstein’s “Lolita Express” private plane, with the pilots testifying to seeing nothing to suggest sexual activity on the part of those onboard during flights. “It’s fair to say, I think, there must be some relief for Andrew that Giuffre did not appear, because it does distance him, somewhat, from the case,” said Stephens. Nonetheless, he added, “it did not matter if Maxwell was found guilty, or innocent”, as the prince’s reputation was already tarnished, “indelibly so, as, frankly, the association with a convicted paedophile like Jeffrey Epstein is enough”. “A guilty verdict on Ghislaine Maxwell, you might say, is almost priced in regarding Prince Andrew and reputational damage. People have already made up their minds about him and the verdict would have no impact on how they view him.” Now Andrew must brace for the next round in the civil case against him, with the US district judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan scheduling a 4 January hearing when the royal’s lawyers are expected to argue for a dismissal of the case. If they are not successful, or if the case is not settled, it is expected to go for trial between September and December 2022. Gloria Allred, a lawyer who represents 20 accusers of Epstein, said it was now a matter of having to “wait and see” if the civil sexual assault case in the US against the duke ever gets to trial. She told BBC Breakfast that “to prove a criminal case, the burden of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt” but “only a preponderance of evidence must be shown in order for there to be the possibility of the defendant being held liable” in a civil case.",News/UK news,"After Ghislaine Maxwell trial, spotlight to fall on Prince Andrew again",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/30/after-ghislaine-maxwell-trial-spotlight-to-fall-on-prince-andrew-again
12/30/2021,"Before England’s Test visit in 2017, Australian spinner Nathan Lyon offered a line much repeated since about hoping to end some England careers. It was taken as it was intended, as a piece of pre-series bluff and bluster. The thing is, Lyon was close to the truth. In the Ashes-obsessed Test calendars for the English and Australian men’s teams, results in that series do make or break careers, on the field and off. Cricket cycles and career cycles have their ends and beginnings marked by these contests.  Plenty of players have their last appearance in an Ashes defeat, tending to be pensioned off thereafter in an effort to make whatever comes next seem like a fresh start. Captains too tend to call it quits – see Ricky Ponting, Michael Clarke, and if not for an early newspaper story, Tim Paine. An Australian coach can survive a loss in England if it isn’t dire, but would never survive one in Australia. England’s current coach, Chris Silverwood, is hotly tipped to hit the exit even with two matches of the ongoing series still to play. All of which makes the position of Justin Langer as Australia coach especially interesting. Early in 2021, and again through the middle months, stories abounded about player discontent with the boss. Those with an interest in being defensive about the situation have tried to cast it as a media concoction, but the initial information did come from within the dressing room. There was substance behind the speculation. This does not make Langer a bad person or a bad coach. It seemed simply to be what we might call Flatmate Syndrome – when you live or work closely with someone for long enough, you can start to get on each other’s nerves. Most coaches start out with goodwill, described by players as refreshing because of their new approach. Gradually, familiarity breeds irritation. The dynamic changes. Things that would be harmless to anyone outside become intolerable. During Australia’s 2020-21 summer of quarantines and bio-bubbles, in a side losing to India, annoyances had the perfect circumstances to hit their highest pitch. As the story rolled on, Cricket Australia backed Langer. In August 2021, senior players and senior administrators arranged a meeting to thrash out what to do next. Shortly before it took place, CA released a statement saying that Langer would see out his contract until early 2022. Being pre-empted didn’t please those players, but it essentially left no option but to work out a compromise. That involved changes to the way coaching sessions were run and to the hierarchy of input, with what seemed like an implicit understanding that Langer would move on after finishing his time. In the few months since, Langer has won Australia’s first T20 World Cup title followed by the Ashes in straight sets. His tactical arrangements have worked, as have a number of creative inclusions abetted by selector George Bailey. The coach is having a golden run. A couple of weeks ago, when asked in a press conference whether he would like to continue in the job after his current term, his answer was simply: “Yes.” If an Ashes loss tends to cost coaching jobs, an Ashes win gives a coach more scope to call the shots. But all of this recent success has still come from working with players who have expected the term limit to stay in place. Perhaps those who were unhappy now feel differently. Presumably the team room is now a more harmonious place. But equally, knowing that there is an end in sight can take the pressure off difficult relationships, where staring into an indefinite future can crank that pressure up. It is no surprise that Langer’s impulse will be to continue. There is no confection about the fact that he loves the job, the sport, and the national team. Working at the pinnacle of all of those things must be deeply gratifying, and nothing else would match it. And Langer has always loved a scrap, proving that he can do things when other people say that he cannot. If he really wants to stay on as coach, he is now in a position where he can probably make that so. It is also worth considering, though, that Australia’s listed assignments for 2022 involve nine Tests in Asia, touring Pakistan, Sri Lanka and India. These trips have historically been tough for teams who struggle in the conditions, and will have to be carried out under heavy biosecurity rules with the background anxiety of Covid infections. The dressing room could very quickly become claustrophobic again. Perhaps Langer sees the coming year as a challenge and an opportunity to make history. Mind you, Joe Root said the same things before Brisbane. The alternative is for the coach to choose his own exit at a high point of success: it could be a 2022 farewell after an Ashes whitewash, just as he did as a player in 2007. These series do get too much attention, but they are still the thing that people in the competing countries most remember. There can be honour in choosing the right time to stop the fight.",Sport/Sport,Justin Langer can go out on a high or risk return to Flatmate Syndrome,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/30/justin-langer-can-go-out-on-a-high-or-risk-return-to-flatmate-syndrome
12/30/2021,"French border officials in the UK have turned back British nationals who are legally resident in other EU countries, saying they are no longer allowed to travel through France by road to reach their homes. Some British travellers trying to reach countries including the Netherlands and Belgium by car were turned back by French border officials in the UK on Wednesday after Eurotunnel issued a warning about what it described as a new travel rule.  The company said a French government decision on Tuesday meant that “unless they hold French residency, British citizens are now considered third country citizens and can no longer transit France by road to reach their country of residence in the EU.” P&O Ferries issued a similar tweet, warning that “only those with French residency will be permitted to enter France.” The British embassy in Paris said last week that “UK nationals may only transit France if travelling by air.” However, British nationals travelling through France to their homes in Belgium by the Eurostar train service have reported no problems reaching their destinations and experts have questioned the legality of new restriction. A French interior ministry official said the country had not changed its list of “compelling” reasons enabling Britons to travel to France since new rules were introduced last week, but “clarified their application” by border police. “It seems logical to consider them like all other third-country citizens, and to not allow their transit toward another EU country,” the official told Agence-France Presse, asking not to be named. However, other ministry officials have said residence in another EU country does constitute a “compelling reason” allowing travel. The French government announced last week that incoming travellers would require “a compelling reason to travel to, or come from, the UK, both for the unvaccinated and vaccinated” from midnight on 11pm GMT on 17 December. “People cannot travel for tourism or professional reasons,” it said. A list of valid “compelling reasons” allowing travellers specifically from the UK to enter France published on 16 December includes EU citizens living in France, or transiting through France to reach their home in an EU member state. It also includes third-country nationals “with a valid French or EU residence permit or long-stay visa resident in France”, as well as “British nationals and family members benefiting from the Brexit withdrawal agreement” (in other words, living in the EU before 31 December 2020) – with no reference to where in the EU they are resident. Moreover, the government’s updated list of “compelling reasons” applicable to countries on France’s Covid orange list, dated 20 December, includes “third-country residents with a valid French or EU residence permit or long-stay visa whose primary residence is in France, or who are transiting through France to reach their primary residence in an EU country”. European law experts have questioned whether applying a no-transit rule to British residents of EU member states travelling through France breaches the Schengen Borders Code, which governs who may cross the EU’s external borders. Since the border between France and the UK is an external border of the EU, there would be no legal basis for France to refuse to allow third-country nationals legally resident in another EU country to cross it to reach their member state of residence. “In my view there’s a strong argument that France is in breach of the Schengen Borders Code,” said Steve Peers, professor of EU law at the University of Essex. “The code has a public health requirement for crossing external borders, but there’s a derogation for those holding a residence permit from a member state and in transit, unless they are subject to a national entry ban of the state they are crossing.” France’s UK-specific list of permitted “compelling reasons” for transiting through France includes passengers of any nationality spending “less than 24 hours in an international zone” of a French airport, which could also explain why some Britons hoping to travel through France by road have been turned back.",News/World news,French border officials in UK turn back British residents of other EU countries,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/french-border-officials-in-uk-turn-back-british-residents-of-other-eu-countries
12/30/2021,"Coronavirus has hit the UK hard, with the country recording more than 12m cases and 140,000 deaths linked to the disease. The government figures below include confirmed cases only – some people who have the disease are not tested.  At the start of the pandemic, London bore the brunt of coronavirus’s impact before the centre of the virus shifted northwards. More recently, hotspots have developed again across the country, with London being hit earliest by the Omicron wave. Everyday life in the UK has been subject to varying degrees of restriction since March 2020, although national restrictions were relaxed in all four nations of the UK over the summer of 2021. Details of the English guidance are listed here, Scottish guidance here, Welsh guidance here and Northern Irish here. Cases in the UK first peaked in early April 2020, before falling in late spring and summer. After reaching a record level in January 2021, cases declined sharply. They remained high but stable after the latest lockdown release in July 2021, but have since surged with the arrival of the Omicron variant. The number of tests available affects the number of recorded cases. The number of people in hospital with coronavirus rose sharply after records started at the end of March 2020, peaking in April. That figure began rising again in September and reached a new record in January 2021. It is now at a relatively low level but is increasing steadily throughout winter 2021-22. Deaths surpassed their first-wave peak in January 2021, with daily deaths once again standing at over 1,000. As with hospitalisations, the number of deaths is now at a relatively low level, although there has been an increase over the autumn and winter. In this graph, deaths are counted as people who have died within 28 days of their first positive test. Counting everyone with Covid-19 listed as a cause on their death certificate results in a higher figure (see note below). Since mid-May 2021, cases have shot up at a rate comparable to the start of the second wave in autumn 2020. However, hospitalisations and deaths remain much lower than at the equivalent time during the second wave. Scientists say this is down to the protective effects of vaccines. Since UK regulators approved the Pfizer vaccine in December 2020, the UK’s vaccine rollout has picked up pace. Until early July, hundreds of thousands of people were being vaccinated every day, although this then slowed down. The introduction of the booster campaign in October 2021 increased vaccine rollout once again. With first-dose vaccines open to over-12s in the UK from 20 October 2021, vaccines are available to everyone except younger children. However, in all age groups there is a persistent number of people who are not vaccinated. The lowest rates of vaccination are among younger age groups. While they were the last to be invited for vaccinations, there are concerns about vaccine hesitancy among younger people. The Covid-19 virus has mutated significantly since it first emerged. A small number of the variants have become “variants of concern” because they are more transmissible, more dangerous or evade vaccines more than the original virus. The Alpha variant that emerged at the end of 2020 was dominant in the UK until it was overtaken by Delta in spring 2021. Since Omicron was declared a variant of concern by the World Health Organization in November 2021, it has entered the UK and spread rapidly. Data in the chart below is based on sampling tests in England and compiled by the Sanger Institute. These numbers lag case data by several weeks. Lockdown had brought down case rates for everyone. But different age groups have been affected differently. Throughout the pandemic working-age people between 20 and 60 have had the highest levels of infection. This has become more stark since the vaccine rollout has protected many of the more vulnerable elderly people in society, with case rates rising among the younger groups while staying relatively low among older people. In the table below, you can find out the number of cases per 100,000 in your area, both for the last week and since the start of the pandemic. This data comes comes from Public Health England, working with devolved authorities in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Differences in data collection and publishing schedules may lead to temporary inconsistencies. The government figures for deaths that are used in this tracker incorporate any deaths that have occurred within 28 days of a positive test. This means they are able to quickly capture deaths occurring in hospitals and care homes, both settings where testing is widespread. The ONS, along with its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland, captures deaths data differently. They count all deaths where Covid is on the death certificate. About 90% of these deaths are directly due to Covid while it is a contributory factor in the remaining deaths.

12/30/2021,"Much of the British public is unaware of sweeping changes to the Highway Code that are due to come into force at the end of January, prompting claims that transport ministers are “missing in action”. The revamped code establishes a hierarchy of road users, which means those who pose the greatest risk to others have a higher level of responsibility. This means someone cycling will have greater responsibility to look out for people walking, while someone driving will have greater responsibility to look out for people cycling, walking or riding a horse.  At least two in three drivers were unaware of the changes before Christmas, according to the AA, which polled 13,000 of its members on the subject. Duncan Dollimore, Cycling UK’s head of campaigns, welcomed the changes but said they “will be of limited benefit if the public aren’t aware of them”. Many of the rules in the code are legal requirements, and to disobey these rules is to commit a criminal offence. The changes introduce new advisory measures that are not legal requirements but could be drawn upon in court proceedings. These include advice that drivers: Should give way to pedestrians crossing or waiting to cross a road into which or from which their vehicle is turning. Should not cut across cyclists or horse riders going ahead when turning into or out of a junction or changing direction or lane, to prevent “left hook” collisions. Should open car doors using the “Dutch reach” method, with the hand on the opposite side to the door they are opening. This makes drivers turn their heads to look over their shoulders and reduces the likelihood of “dooring” a passing cyclist. Should leave at least 1.5 metres when overtaking cyclists at speeds of up to 30mph, and give them more space when overtaking at higher speeds. The code also advises cyclists to give way to pedestrians on shared-use cycle tracks and to horse riders on bridleways, and to “slow down when necessary and let them know you are there, for example by ringing your bell (it is recommended that a bell is fitted to your bike) or by calling out politely.” Dollimore said: “Many people won’t have read the Highway Code for years, so it’s essential that the key changes are clearly explained, with simple, accurate and memorable messages. “These changes have legal implications. Just as we saw with the introduction of other road safety measures like mandatory seat belts and stricter drink-driving laws, the public needs to be accurately informed about the new rules. The hierarchy of responsibility and changes to junction priority need to be explained and communicated properly, regardless of whether or not everyone agrees with them.” Louise Haigh, the shadow transport secretary, said: “With cyclists feeling increasingly unsafe, these are welcome changes, but they will be totally meaningless if the public don’t know anything about them. A comprehensive national safety campaign is needed to keep cyclists safe on our roads, but ministers are missing in action.” Cycling UK called on the government to implement “a long-term and well-funded communications campaign” to raise awareness of the new code. A spokesperson for the Department for Transport said: “The proposed upcoming changes to the Highway Code will improve safety for cyclists, pedestrians and horse riders and were announced to national press. “The department has established a working group of key organisations to ensure that messages about the changes are as widespread as possible, and our well-established Think! campaign will continue to ensure all road users are aware both when these changes come into effect and beyond.” If approved by parliament, the changes to the Highway Code will come into force on 29 January 2022.",News/UK news,Two in three UK drivers unaware of planned Highway Code changes,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/30/two-in-three-uk-drivers-unaware-of-planned-highway-code-changes
12/30/2021,"Of all the predictions on your 2021 bingo card, who had employees being fined for going into the office? Workers in Wales now face that threat since the tightening of Covid regulations amid the spread of the Omicron variant, with a possible £60 penalty for failing to work from home. That is just one of many examples of how the pandemic has transformed the world of work this year – and perhaps for ever – for city centre employers, their staff and the service industry that depends on them for trade.  Most white-collar workers are ending 2021 back where they began – hunched over laptops on kitchen tables, in spare rooms or even garden sheds. Yet this deja vu obscures a big change: it has been demonstrated to many employers that staff can do productive work from home, a hotel room or even a poolside lounger in another country, and don’t necessarily need to be in a city centre office. As lockdown restrictions eased during the spring, many companies started to trial a hybrid model, permitting staff to split their time between the office and another location. Across a range of sectors, many of the UK’s largest office occupiers have shifted to this middle-way working pattern, from the big four accountancy firms to major tech companies. Deloitte’s 20,000 UK employees were told in June they could decide “when, where and how they work” following the success of remote working during Covid. Very few large corporates now expect staff to return to their desks for five days a week, with the exception of some major investment banks, who have been the loudest proponents of the return-to-office mantra. Remote working in 2021 also offered companies a chance to downsize their offices and slash their rent bills. Capita, one of the major providers of outsourced services to the UK government, announced in the spring it would close more of its offices to make bigger cost savings. Sir Martin Sorrell’s advertising and marketing firm, S4 Capital, told investors in the summer it had “terminated a number of office leases”, adding it was developing its hybrid office model to suit its workers, who it described as “digital natives”. Meanwhile NatWest said it expects just 13% of its 64,000 staff to work full time in its offices in future. A third of the bank’s employees will be allowed to live and work anywhere in the UK and will only have to attend a NatWest building twice a month. Working parents, people with caring responsibilities, and some disabled workers are among those who have welcomed the widespread shift to flexible working, which they have long demanded. However, employment experts warn that, without proper monitoring, the switch could worsen workplace gender inequality. Traditionally, more women have requested flexible working than men, and analysts caution that employers will have to ensure that those who attend the office less frequently do not miss out on opportunities for promotion. A fifth (22%) of workers worry home working could affect their promotion prospects, according to a recent survey for stockbroker AJ Bell. The poll also found the burden of childcare among home workers still falls disproportionately on mothers, with more than a third (36%) of women with children under 16 reporting they do the lion’s share of childcare during work hours, compared with 19% of men. There is also concern about the effect on pay. Evie, an executive assistant from Essex who did not want to give her surname, has enjoyed working from home, but said she was being offered lower salaries by prospective employers than before the pandemic. “It’s been said to me in an interview [the salary was lower] because I’d be working from home and wouldn’t have to commute,” she said. “It’s definitely a game a few employers are playing. They’ll get you to sign the contract, but when restrictions change and we go back to the office, I know they won’t put the money up.” Once the slow and steady return to the office began in the spring, it became clear that workers were ditching their commute on Mondays and Fridays. In a national trend, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday became the busiest days of the week for office visits, according to regular analysis during 2021 by real estate consultancy Remit Consulting. “The pattern so far during the pandemic has been for Thursdays to be as busy as Wednesdays, and sometimes busier,” said Lorna Landells of Remit Consulting, adding that Friday was slipping behind as an office day. If this change becomes permanent, it will have lasting implications for transport companies and the city-centre service businesses – from sandwich shops and coffee bars to hairdressers and dry-cleaners – who depend on passing trade. Some companies and some countries – including the governments of Spain and Scotland – are considering going further, and taking a fresh look at four-day week through pilot schemes. Durham-based online bank Atom is one of the few employers which has taken the leap. It moved all of its 400 staff to a four-day week, with no change in salary, at the start of November. The company said its operations and customer service have not been impacted by the change, although it had seen a 500% surge in job applications. “Our adoption of a four-day working week has been a huge success, and we are proud of how well our employees have adapted,” said Anne-Marie Lister, Atom’s chief people officer. “We firmly believe that a four-day week is the future of work for many.” For some, the future of work means handing in their notice. In what has been termed “the great resignation”, more than a quarter of workers reported they were actively planning to change jobs in the coming months. Having stayed in posts where they were unhappy during the height of the pandemic, employees have begun to look for new roles, according to a survey of 6,000 workers by the recruitment firm Randstad UK. Others have been spurred on to look for a new employer by high levels of job vacancies and higher pay offers from those desperate to recruit. For now, power looks to be in the hands of employees – not their employers – and they know what they want: more flexibility about where and when they work. Many will benefit from a better work-life balance, but the repercussions for city centres and society will be felt for some time to come.",News/Business,How the pandemic transformed the world of work in 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/dec/30/how-the-pandemic-transformed-the-world-of-work-in-2021
12/30/2021,"He may have ruled out a move in January but there remains a slim chance that the France forward could join Real Madrid this month after their failed attempts to sign him in the summer. Mbappé is entering the final six months of his contract with Paris Saint-Germain and can therefore sign a pre-contract agreement with the Spanish giants, although talks are said to be on hold until after the two clubs meet in the second leg of their last-16 Champions League on 9 March. Whether Madrid will attempt to force the issue before then remains to be seen.  Ralf Rangnick has made no secret of the forward’s desire to leave Old Trafford seven years after he became the most expensive teenager in history but his destination remains unclear. A loan bid from Sevilla that would have involved the Spanish club paying half of Martial’s £150,000 a week wages was rejected, with United not prepared to finance any loan move. Barcelona and Juventus have also been credited with interest in the 26-year-old, who has slipped down the pecking order following the return of Cristiano Ronaldo and played only 200 minutes in the Premier League so far. The Leeds forward has been heavily linked with Bayern Munich and the German champions could decide to make their move should they allow Kingsley Coman to join Barcelona. Any offers would be strongly resisted, however, by Leeds, who are wary of losing their key creative player while they are battling against relegation. Liverpool have also been linked with the player signed from the French side Rennes in October 2020, whose contract expires in 2024. The Brazilian could cost around £60m. The Switzerland international’s decision not to sign a new contract with Borussia Mönchengladbach has put several clubs on alert, with West Ham and Juventus among those to have been linked in recent days. A defensive midfielder who is also capable of filling in at centre-back, Zakaria – who was born in Switzerland to a South Sudanese mother and Congolese father – moved to Germany in 2017 from Young Boys and has also merited attention from Manchester United and Liverpool. Perhaps unsurprisingly after his outburst on social media in August when he pleaded to be allowed to move to Everton on a season-long loan, Mikel Arteta has rarely turned to Maitland-Niles so far this campaign. Despite praising him after the win over Watford, the 24-year-old has not featured since in the Premier League. The England international has made only two starts in the Premier League and is expected to join Roma, linking up with the former Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham and, of course, José Mourinho in what could be a permanent deal for around £12m. The defender described as “one of the smartest players I ever worked with” by the Liverpool manager, Jürgen Klopp, has yet to feature in the Premier League this season having filled in admirably during the club’s injury-ravaged title defence. Now it could be time for a new chapter after Phillips asked to move on in January should they receive a suitable offer, with the 24-year-old recovering from a fractured cheekbone that kept him out of the festive schedule. West Ham – in the midst of their own defensive crisis – are among those to have been linked. A striker whose scoring record has been transformed since being surprisingly called up by Chile for the first time earlier this year. Brereton Diaz has been in spectacular form for Blackburn since returning from his exploits at the Copa América in the summer and a host of Premier League clubs have clearly been paying attention. Brighton and Leeds are among them, with Tony Mowbray suggesting it would take around £30m to tempt Blackburn into selling. “If somebody bids the money that we can’t turn down and it’s life-changing for Ben Brereton Diaz, then who am I to stop him from earning £100k-per-week?” The England mainstay has thrived under the tutelage of Diego Simeone since joining Atlético from Tottenham in 2019 but looks likely to return to the Premier League as Newcastle’s first major signing since the Saudi takeover. Talks are said to be progressing well and the 31-year-old would bring undoubted experience and quality to a side who are struggling to survive under their new manager, Eddie Howe, with Trippier likely to earn a significant pay rise for swapping the top of La Liga for the bottom of the Premier League. The 21-year-old has been turning heads around Europe all season having fired 16 goals in Serie A for Fiorentina already and is well on course to beat the 23 he managed last term. Vlahovic’s contract ends in 2023 and he has already rejected an offer to become the highest-paid player in the club’s history, with some of the Premier League’s biggest sides reportedly monitoring the situation. While it could take an offer north of £70m to tempt Fiorentina into doing business in January, they may decide to cash in if the right deal presents itself. With Rafael Benítez preferring to field players out of position at left-back as his dispute with Digne drags on, it seems likely that Everton will allow the France international to leave Goodison Park in January. Chelsea have been mentioned as a potential destination after the injury to Ben Chilwell ruled him out for the rest of the season, with Thomas Tuchel’s side expected to aim for a loan deal that may suit both parties in the short term. Any deal for Digne could also smooth the waters for Ross Barkley to return to Goodison Park on loan.",Sport/Football,Ten January transfer targets – from Mbappé to Raphinha and Vlahovic,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/30/ten-january-transfer-window-targets-from-mbappe-to-raphinha-and-vlahovic

12/30/2021,"If Boris Johnson wants to know why the Conservative party struggles to win the support of young voters in London he could start by looking at the annual report on the housing market from the Nationwide. There is no single reason for the government’s unpopularity among people in their 20s and 30s in the capital, but housing is clearly a factor, and the current state of the market shows why. Without a top salary or generous parents, homeownership is all but impossible.  Nationwide measures affordability by using regional earnings and house price data to show where in the income distribution a potential purchaser would sit if they were aiming for a typical first-time buyer property, assuming a 20% deposit and borrowing four times their annual earnings. In Scotland and northern England, the typical buyer would be in the 30th income percentile, whereas in the south-east they would be in the 80th percentile. In London they would be above the 90th percentile. That means someone on a modest salary in Glasgow can still aspire to buy their own home, whereas for all but the top 10% of earners in London, renting is the only real option. As house prices have increased faster than incomes for the past decade, affordability has become more of an issue. Ten years ago, the average first-time buyer in the south-east was in the 60th income percentile. This trend goes some way to answering the big question for the property market in the year ahead: when will the pandemic boom that has seen prices rise by 16% since early 2020 come to an end? A number of factors mean last year’s 10% increase in prices is unlikely to be repeated. Mortgage rates are rising and some purchases were brought forward into 2021 to take advantage of the government’s stamp duty holiday. But, as the Nationwide notes, affordability will be a factor. There comes a point where houses are simply too expensive for first-time buyers, even if they can access the bank of Mum and Dad. Not everybody wants to own a home, of course, but the Conservatives have always liked to be seen as the party that sticks up for those who do. That’s a tough case to make when a 20% deposit on a typical first-time-buyer home in London is now £88,000 – almost double the average annual gross income in the capital.",News/UK news,London house prices may help explain Tories’ struggle to win young voters,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/30/london-house-prices-may-help-explain-tories-struggle-to-win-young-voters
12/30/2021,"The world-famous Uffizi gallery in Florence displays an unrivalled collection of works by Renaissance greats including Michelangelo, Leonardo and Raphael. However, its director believes that is not enough, and says it is now crucial for museums to play a role in highlighting the issues of today and confront the “toxic social structures” of the past rather than simply glorifying its artists. Eike Schmidt, the director of Uffizi Galleries since 2015, has a reputation for modernisation and in a dramatic shift from the norm, he hosted an exhibition before Christmas aimed at reflecting the violence women have suffered at the hands of male perpetrators – beginning with one of the greatest sculptors of the 17th century, Gian Lorenzo Bernini.  Alongside contemporary portraits by Ilaria Sagaria featuring female victims of acid attacks stood Bernini’s Bust of Costanza Bonarelli, a marble portrait of his lover that the artist sculpted months before he commissioned his servant to slash her face in a fit of jealousy over her relationship with another man. “This is a world-famous bust but hardly anyone beyond the world of specialists knows her story,” said Schmidt. “The bust shows her in a very personal situation, her hair is undone and she’s wearing a semi-transparent robe with buttons open. So clearly Bernini made this when they were lovers. But not even a year later, he became jealous because she was with another man and so had her cheek slashed. This is exactly what happens today to so many women by jealous ex-partners.” Bernini got off with a token fine while Costanza was banished to a monastery. “I really wanted to make this connection between a work of art that is really naively admired and contributes to the fame of Bernini [and] the very problematic side of Bernini that was socially accepted at the time,” he said. “I think it’s absolutely our mission to tackle these social issues where we can, otherwise what is our sense?” Schmidt has been widely credited with making the Uffizi’s art more accessible to all social classes, improving the visitor experience, cracking down on ticket touts and celebrating female artists. It has the largest collection in the world of works by female painters who were active before the 19th century, but before Schmidt arrived the works were not given much exposure. He organised a series of exhibitions dedicated to historical female artists including Lavinia Fontana, the first professional female painter in Italy, and their contemporary counterparts. “Many people don’t even know that there were women painters before the 19th century,” he said. “But their marginalisation was really a phenomenon of the 19th and 20th centuries, they were not marginalised in their own time.” He has been unafraid to use controversial tactics, such as working with one of Italy’s top fashion influencers, Chiara Ferragni, to attract a younger audience. Ferragni was in the museum in 2020 for a shoot with Vogue Hong Kong before an exhibition there, and posed for a photo in front of Sandro Botticelli’s The Birth of Venus before posting it on Instagram and recommending her followers visit the museum.

To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. “That was a little bit provocative and we knew it would be,” said Schmidt. “We had about 1,000 complaints but 8,000 additional followers, so in the end it was a big win for us.” Schmidt was the target of controversy when he was appointed as the Uffizi’s first non-Italian director. Along with foreign directors of some other cultural sites, his position became precarious during the short-lived government between the Five Star Movement and far-right League, which had tried to undo museum changes made by the previous government. But after the coalition collapsed in August 2019, Schmidt renounced an offer to take the helm at Vienna’s Kunsthistorisches Museum and his mandate was extended. Six months later, Schmidt was faced with the long closures brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, delivering a significant hit on takings. But he used the period to come up with a strategy for tackling pre-pandemic problems, such as overcrowding, before visitors returned, while at the same time making the museum’s trove of treasures accessible to people living beyond Florence. This year, he started sharing some of the Uffizi’s works with museums in other areas of Tuscany, as part of the “Uffizi diffusi”, or “Diffused Uffizi”, project. “Even if we had the space to build another wing, or three, we still wouldn’t be able to show all the treasures we have,” he said. “So it made sense to have works displayed close to where people live. The idea was to spread tourism with the entire region of Tuscany rather than just having everyone in Florence.” And in a deal worth more than €2m (£1.7m) signed in November, the Uffizi will lend some of its masterpieces to the Bund One Art Museum in Shanghai for a series of exhibitions, beginning with Botticelli in spring 2022. “We have to consider that the Chinese haven’t been able to travel to Europe for almost two years,” Schmidt said. “There is a value in sharing works from our culture with people on the other side of the globe. But before we even think about what we’re sharing we have to see what condition the works are in, and if they’re not fit to travel, they won’t travel.”",News/World news,Uffizi director calls on museums to confront society’s ‘toxic’ past,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/uffizi-director-museums-confront-society-toxic-past
12/30/2021,"What’s in a name? Quite a lot in the case of the musical Kipps, which aired on Sky Arts on Wednesday night. The title comes from the 1905 HG Wells novel, but the show itself is a radical rewrite of an earlier musical version of the story, Half a Sixpence, which starred Tommy Steele on stage and film in the 1960s. Julian Fellowes wrote the fresh book, which he titled Half a Sixpence, in 2016, while George Stiles and Anthony Drewe added seven new numbers to the original David Heneker score. What we saw on screen was a filmed performance at London’s Noël Coward theatre in 2017. So what’s the difference between the original Half a Sixpence and Kipps? I would say that the former – especially in the 1967 film version where Julia Foster co-starred with Steele – was essentially a romantic tale about how Artie Kipps finally finds true love with his childhood sweetheart, Ann. Kipps is closer to Wells’s original in that it is a comic parable about the English class system. I even wonder whether the novel influenced Shaw’s Pygmalion, which dates from 1912, in that it shows how in a rigidly stratified society accent determines status.  Given Fellowes’s creation of Downton Abbey, what is most surprising about Kipps is its portrayal of the English upper class as brutally snobbish predators. Artie himself is a Kentish draper who comes into a fortune and finds himself, despite his avowals to Ann, falling for the do-gooding Helen Walsingham. But it is made abundantly clear that Helen is being used as bait by her upper-crust family to hook the wealthy Kipps. Two artfully juxtaposed numbers demonstrate how money can be used for ill or good. In one, Ann’s criminal brother tempts Kipps with capital gains. In another, the raffishly thespian Chitterlow hymns “the joy of the theatre” and asks Artie to invest in his new play. But I’ve long argued that any musical needs a moment of ecstasy where song, dance and story combine to spirit-lifting effect. In Half a Sixpence, it comes in the number Flash, Bang, Wallop, which is a pub knees-up with its roots in English music-hall. In Kipps, it comes in a new song, Pick Out a Simple Tune, where Artie galvanises a starchy musical evening by playing on his banjo: “Just keep plucking with your plectrum / make new friends across the spectrum,” he jovially sings as Folkestone’s finest rattle spoons, whirl, twirl and even swing from the chandeliers. Fun as the musical is, it already shows its age: conspicuously, there is no diversity in the casting. But Kipps confirms Wells’s point that gusto and goodness can overcome the whaleboned snobbery of the class system and the show boasts an invaluable asset in Charlie Stemp, who went on to play the chimney sweep in the stage version of Mary Poppins. Tommy Steele was likable in Half a Sixpence, but there is something a touch calculated about his charm. Stemp radiates kindly innocence and reminds us that Wells subtitled his quietly subversive novel “the story of a simple soul”. Kipps is repeated on Sky Arts at 3pm on 1 January.",Arts/Stage,Julian Fellowes turns Half a Sixpence rewrite Kipps into winning fun,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2021/dec/30/julian-fellowes-turns-half-a-sixpence-rewrite-kipps-into-winning-fun
12/30/2021,"Southern has cancelled trains to and from London Victoria for two weeks as a result of pandemic-related staff shortages. Disruption to rail services has been worsening over the Christmas period while industrial action continues. Southern has now announced that none of its trains will run to or from London Victoria until 10 January owing to “coronavirus isolation and sickness”.  London Victoria is one of the UK’s busiest stations, and is normally connected by Southern to locations such as Brighton, Eastbourne and Portsmouth. Meanwhile, CrossCountry has said a strike by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union means it will run “a very limited timetable” on New Year’s Eve. It will not operate any trains between Aberdeen and Edinburgh; Glasgow Central and Edinburgh; Derby and Nottingham; Peterborough and Stansted; Cheltenham Spa and Cardiff Central; Newton Abbot and Paignton; and Plymouth and Penzance. A heavily reduced service will be in place between Edinburgh and Plymouth; Manchester Piccadilly and Bournemouth; and Birmingham New Street and Peterborough. The strike involves train managers and senior conductors, in a dispute over the role of guards. Many other operators in addition to Southern have cancelled trains owing to the pandemic. They include Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Greater Anglia, London North Eastern Railway, Northern, ScotRail, TransPennine Express and Transport for Wales. The suspension of Southern’s London Victoria services means it will not serve Clapham Junction, Wandsworth Common or Battersea Park. Planned resignalling work at London Victoria had already resulted in most Southern trains due to serve the station between 27 December and 3 January being diverted to run to and from London Bridge. This was timed to coincide with the festive period when demand for travel is lower. RMT members employed by Gate Gourmet are involved in a strike at Edinburgh Waverley on New Year’s Eve as part of a long-running dispute over allegations of bullying. The RMT general secretary, Mick Lynch, said: “The disruption to services from the New Year’s Eve strike action is wholly down to these greedy private companies on our railways seeking to squeeze out every penny they can by hammering down on safety, jobs and workplace dignity. We are ready for a new year of campaigning and action on all fronts.”",News/UK news,Southern cancels London Victoria trains for two weeks over Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/30/southern-cancels-london-victoria-trains-for-two-weeks-over-covid
12/30/2021,"The giant warehouse towers over the Belarus countryside, less than a mile from the Polish border. In this 10,000 sq metre space patrolled by dozens of armed soldiers, 1,000 asylum seekers are crammed among countless industrial shelving units, held up on their way to Europe in the midst of a frigid winter. “We’re trapped in this building,” says Alima Skandar, 40. “We don’t want to go back to Iraq and we can’t cross the border. Please, help us.”  What was a customs centre in the village of Bruzgi has been turned into a dormitory for asylum seekers. The EU has accused Belarus’s leader, Alexander Lukashenko, of deliberately provoking a new refugee crisis by organising the movement of people from the Middle East to Minsk and promising them a safe passage to Europe. Lukashenko’s critics say the exploitation of these people is a callous reprisal for sanctions that Brussels has imposed on his regime. Last autumn Skandar, her husband and their four children arrived in Belarus on a flight from Iraqi Kurdistan and then camped for weeks surrounded by barbed wire that Poland had erected along its border. Early in November, Belarusian authorities escorted thousands of asylum seekers to the Polish frontier in an escalation of the crisis. Witnesses told the Guardian how Belarusian troops gathered groups of up to 50 people and cut the barbed wire with shears to allow them to cross. Hundreds managed to evade the Polish police by hiding in the forests. Others were caught and pushed back violently to Belarus by Poland’s border guards. On 6 November, during a harrowing attempt to cross the frontier, Skandar was separated from three of her children, whose ages range from 13 to 20. “When the Belarusian soldiers cut the barbed wire, hundreds of us moved toward the border,” Skandar says. “Three of my children were in front and ran for the forests across the border. My husband, our youngest child and myself were left behind. The Polish police seized us and sent us back to Belarus. “I haven’t seen my children since that day,” she adds, beginning to cry. “I hope they’re OK.” As the days passed, the crisis grew more concerning, with Polish police using teargas and water cannon against people attempting to cross, and the EU adding new sanctions against Belarus. As temperatures plummeted, Belarusian authorities began to move the asylum seekers to the warehouse in Burzgi. Inside, on shelving units once used for merchandise, people have built makeshift cots using wooden planks and cardboard boxes. There are dozens of children and elderly people, many in need of medical help. Outside, other people sit around a wood-fuelled structure used to heat food and water. The water is for the showers, which are located out in the snowy cold. Temperatures in Bruzgi can reach as low as minus 12C. The majority of people in the camp come from Iraq’s autonomous Kurdish region, where on 3 December an attack by Islamic State militants killed three civilians and 10 Kurdish soldiers. Occasionally, groups of people, mainly in their 20s, attempt to cross the border in the cold. Some make it, others don’t. At least 19 people have died since the beginning of the border standoff. Most of them froze to death. Some of their bodies were sent back to their home countries from Minsk alongside dozens of people forcibly repatriated by Belarusian authorities or who decided to return voluntarily. Ebrahim Naman, 20, watches his peers plan their next attempt to cross the frontier. He hopes for a different solution, as for the past two years, since an accident in his home country, Naman has been in a wheelchair. He has undergone several surgeries on his back, and doctors have told him that new rehabilitation techniques in Europe could help him to walk again. For weeks, Naman has camped with his family in front of the barbed wire, hoping to be allowed in. Unable to make his way through the forest in his wheelchair, six people carried him along on a bedsheet. “My son must make it to Germany,” says his father. “He needs medicines every day, and there are none here. I hope that Europe does something to help people like him who need urgent medical attention.” A rumour have been circulating in the warehouse for weeks that Germany will take in these people before year’s end. It has not been corroborated. A 32-year-old woman from Syria says she would rather “die on the spot from a bullet or the cold” than go back. She arrived in Belarus on 28 October on a direct flight from Damascus with her mother and husband. Her mother had a kidney transplant and is in need of medical assistance. “She was a nurse in a state hospital in Idlib where, among other things, she looked after the injured in the army,” her daughter says. “As a result, the opposition started to perceive her as a traitor and supporter of the regime and our properties were confiscated.” The woman says her brother, who lives in Germany, is trying to get them out of here through an asylum organisation, and booked an appointment at the embassy to submit applications, but Belarusian authorities told them that if they left the camp they would not be allowed to return. On 26 November, during a visit to Bruzgi, Lukashenko promised that Belarus would never play politics with refugees’ lives. “Whoever wants to move westward, it is also your right,” Lukashenko said in a speech that was translated in Arabic. “We are not going to keep you behind barbed wire or beat you.” The warehouse occupants say that generally Belarusian soldiers are not mistreating them – except for one man, a tall soldier in a black uniform, who is said to be one of the heads of the troops at the camp. “He is the most evil,” a man from Iraq says. “We often see him beating children.” The border checkpoint of Kuźnica is about 500 metres from the warehouse. There is little evidence now of the people who camped there for months, just a pile of rags and bottles.

12/30/2021,"It was supposed to be a “super year for nature”: 2020 was going to be “a major opportunity to bring nature back from the brink”. But then the coronavirus pandemic set in and long-held plans to tackle the environmental crisis, kickstarted at Davos in January, where the financial elite underscored the risks of global heating and biodiversity loss to human civilisation, never happened. The biggest biodiversity summit in a decade, Cop15 in Kunming, China, where world leaders were expected to strike a deal to halt and reverse the destruction of ecosystems by reaching a Paris-style agreement for nature was postponed until 2021. The Cop26 climate summit was also postponed for a year. As we enter 2022, there has still not been a super year for nature. Substantive negotiations for the biodiversity Cop15 meeting in China, the little sister to the climate convention, are likely to be delayed a fourth time as a result of the Omicron variant. Preparatory talks planned for January 2022 in Geneva have been pushed back – again – until March in a process that is feeling increasingly cursed, despite the best efforts of organisers.  At Cop15 – the 15th conference of the parties to the UN convention on biological diversity – governments will negotiate new targets to protect biodiversity for this decade. The accord, “a Paris agreement for nature”, aims to slow rampant biodiversity loss around the world and is part of the UN’s overarching plan that humanity should be living in harmony with nature by 2050. The summit was originally due to take place in October 2020 but after several delays it is hoped that a face-to-face meeting will happen in 2022. Why is it a big deal?Time is running out to take action. An international group of scientists, including Prof Paul Ehrlich, author of The Population Bomb, warned in January 2021 that the planet is facing a “ghastly future of mass extinction, declining health and climate-disruption upheavals” that threaten human survival. The world has failed to meet a single target agreed a decade ago to stem the destruction of wildlife and life-sustaining ecosystems. Are only governments worried?No. At the 2021 World Economic Forum, business leaders said biodiversity loss was the third biggest existential, or long-term threat, to the world and was among the top five risks in terms of impact, alongside infectious diseases, climate action failure, weapons of mass destruction and natural resource crises. What might the Kunming agreement look like?In January 2021, the UN convention on biological diversity published a 21-point draft of the agreement. It commits signatories to protect at least 30% of the planet, control invasive species and reduce pollution from plastic waste and excess nutrients by 50%. Governments are yet to negotiate properly on the draft targets.  “We’ll get it done. Come hell, high water … or Covid. When and how, I don’t know,” says Basile van Havre, co-chair of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) working group responsible for crafting the Cop15 agreement. The 21-point draft includes targets on eliminating plastic pollution, reducing pesticide use by two-thirds and halving the rate of invasive species introductions, aimed at cutting the rate of extinctions and protecting life-sustaining ecosystems. Amid the delays, warnings about the health of the planet have not gone away. Scientists say the sixth mass extinction of life on Earth is under way and accelerating, driven by human behaviour. A million plant and animal species could disappear, according to a UN report complied by leading researchers, which also found the biomass of wild mammals has fallen by 82% and natural ecosystems have lost about half their area. During the pandemic, the destruction of the world’s forests increased sharply. Dangerous levels of greenhouse gases continue to accumulate in Earth’s atmosphere as humans consume beyond planetary boundaries. And yet, the world’s governments have missed every single target they have set for themselves on averting the destruction of the natural world. “It’s like a debt that you’re not paying back. You keep accumulating the interest and that’s going to have to be repaid at some point,” van Havre says. “The later you wait, the more expensive it will be.” CBD negotiators last met in person in February 2020 in Rome, as the pandemic took hold. In May 2021, representatives from the 196 parties to the agreement embarked on a gruelling schedule of online talks to get back on track, meeting six days a week for three hours until mid-June. Negotiators for Pacific island states were among those who attended the video calls in the early hours due to timings of the meeting. From there, hope rose that the process could finally be completed. A ceremonial opening of Cop15 in Kunming, split in two because of the delays, took place in October, in which China took the presidency, the first time Beijing has hosted a major UN environmental conference. A group of philanthropists, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, donated $5bn to protect 30% of the planet by the end of the decade. There was an emphasis on nature and biodiversity at Cop26 with side deals on deforestation and a mention for nature in the Glasgow pact. Then, yet again, the pandemic had other plans. “Covid is a curse, of course. Can you imagine if Omicron happened a month earlier and what would have happened with Glasgow. But, as always seems to be the case, the CBD was the unlucky one,” says Li Shuo, a policy adviser for Greenpeace East Asia, who says he will be watching Covid protocols closely at the Beijing Winter Olympics to assess the likely restrictions on delegates at Kunming part two. While Cop15 in person may remain in doubt, plans for the first IUCN Africa Protected Areas Congress (APAC), to be held in Kigali, Rwanda, in March 2022 are for now still on track. The summit promises to be “the first ever continent-wide gathering of African leaders, citizens, and interest groups to discuss the role of protected areas in conserving nature”. If 2022 is to finally be a super year for nature, experts say three main things need to happen. First, countries must strike an agreement at Cop15 – whenever it happens – that is reflective of the crisis in the natural world and, most importantly, they must stick to it. Second, nature needs an elegant north star akin to the 1.5C and 2C climate targets that everyone can pursue, from businesses and governments to NGOs and citizens. Finally, 2022 must be the year the world adopts a single strategy to tackle the three environmental conventions agreed nearly 30 years ago at the Earth summit in Rio de Janeiro. Scientists are clear that the climate crisis, destruction of nature, and desertification cannot be tackled in isolation, and countries should follow the example of Uruguay, which is developing a combined approach. Resolving divisions between developed and developing countries from Cop26 will be key if there is to be a Paris-style agreement for nature, says van Havre, who emphasises the role of civil society in the negotiations and the “trust or lack thereof around the $100bn of climate funding from developed countries … There are consequences. “NGOs were important for lifting ambition at Cop26 in Glasgow. That is a clear signal of what we will need in Kunming. We will need them to be able to engage with delegates on site, not in a different place,” he adds. Despite support from dozens of nations to protect 30% of land and sea by 2030, countries including South Africa are arguing for a lower number to be included in the final Kunming agreement. Ambition on targets relating to plastics pollution, pesticide use and harmful subsidies will also be weighed against financial commitments, expert commentators say. In terms of a rhetorical north star for nature, many in the biodiversity community are continuing to search for a coherent term. “Nature positive”, a phrase increasingly used by businesses and governments, lacks a formal definition and will include more complicated metrics than its climate equivalents. Leading fossil fuel companies, such as BP and TotalEnergies, have started to develop strategies for their projects to have a positive impact on biodiversity. “I think we need to recognise that, unlike climate change, where the 1.5C is a target, biodiversity is more complex,” says Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, the UN’s biodiversity head. “A number of factors will make something nature positive or not: land, the sea, climate change, chemicals, pollution, invasive species. All that increases the complexity. It will be difficult to have the equivalent to 1.5C.” But Eva Zabey, director of Business for Nature, says the perfect cannot be the enemy of the good when it comes to developing a system businesses and civil society can follow for nature. “In my view, nature positive is the equivalent of net zero, which is not in the Paris agreement text but is a way of making it more accessible,” says Zabey. “We shouldn’t be waiting for a framework to start the action. There are some ‘no regret’ actions that companies should take now. Make sure your supply chain is deforestation free, for example. There’s no reason not to start innovating new products and to invest in protecting and restoring ecosystems.” Officials have started to hint at the need for another Earth summit to respond to the challenges of the 21st century. Some developing countries are seeking to separate issues of biodiversity and climate at UN negotiations in the hope of dual streams of funding. But the UK and France have started to allocate climate funding to biodiversity, indicating how intertwined the issues are. Maintaining coherence between climate, biodiversity and desertification treaties will be key, says Mrema. “If these three conventions were to be negotiated today, probably there would just be one treaty. At the time, the world was looking at issues in silos. Time and again, scientists have reminded us that that doesn’t work. Taking care of soil will look after biodiversity and help with the climate, for example. Likewise, we cannot dissect when it comes to implementation,” she says. Do we need a new Earth summit? “That could be an important question to ask ourselves,” says Mrema. In terms of whether these issues will be resolved at Kunming part 2 next year, Li Shuo says the Chinese presidency may need to find its own Alok Sharma (Cop26 president) or Archie Young (lead climate negotiator for the UK) to have any hope of making it a super year for nature. He says: “How do they translate a political-level mandate into the technical nitty gritty? It is a big question. Are we transitioning into a time period when they do that? Or are we going to see that during the Cop?” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,"‘We’ll get it done.
