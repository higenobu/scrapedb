12/13/2021,"Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger tends to be much more direct with his warnings and criticisms than his business partner, Warren Buffett. Munger didn’t mince words when he said earlier this month that he considers today’s stock market environment “even crazier than the dot-com era.” ""I just can't stand participating in these insane booms,” Munger said at the Sohn Hearts & Minds Investment Leaders Conference. “There's no great company that can't be turned into a bad investment just by raising the price."" Munger, as usual, had harsh words for cryptocurrencies. He praised China’s crackdown on crypto and said he wished the technology “had never been invented.” One way to avoid both crypto and getting burned by an overvalued market is to look at companies with stock that has dropped but seems poised for a rebound. Here are three stocks with some bruises that fit that category. You might even be able to include some undervalued stocks in your portfolio with a little spare change. Disney’s stock got hammered in the pandemic’s early days, shedding about 38% of its value in the month ending March 20, 2020. After rallying for much of last year, it’s down almost 15% since the beginning of 2021. Disney’s earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended Oct. 2, came in about $200 million short of expectations. Its theme parks are still operating at reduced capacity, so Q4’s results could have been much worse. Streaming platform Disney+ is up to 118.1 million subscribers, and the company projects that figure will grow to more than 230 million by 2024. While the company says Disney+ subscriber growth slowed, revenue from subscriptions across Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu was $4.6 billion in Q4 — 38% higher than a year before. Disney remains a beloved global brand and says it expects international visitors to parks to pick up later in 2022 as restrictions ease. JPMorgan Chase predicts a full economic rebound from COVID-19 in 2022, and if that’s true, Disney’s theme parks could once again be packed. Mastercard’s stock has been mostly trending downward since July, and it recently hit the skids, shrinking by 17% from Nov. 16 through Dec. 1. However, it’s trending upward over the last week or so, recovering most of that recent loss. The sell-off of Mastercard’s stock doesn’t appear to have anything to do with the company’s performance. Q3 net revenue was $5 billion, a year-over-year increase of 30%. Purchase volume was up 23% over the same period. Mastercard’s in a tricky position. Buy now, pay later apps are doing their best to disrupt the credit card space, and the company doesn’t currently seem to have an answer that will help increase the company’s cache with younger users. But that could be more of a long-term issue. In the short-term, inflation-jacked prices mean customers are paying more, and a rebound in tourism and credit card spending should have the company’s users — there’s almost a billion of them — ringing up purchases left and right. AT&T’s stock has been on a downward tumble for a while now. Its share price is 45% lower than it was five years ago, and is down more than 22% this year alone. AT&T has taken some big swings that haven’t paid off. Its purchase of DirecTV and Time Warner in 2015 and 2018, respectively, added more than $130 billion in debt to the company’s balance sheet. Last year, T-Mobile replaced AT&T as America’s second-largest wireless carrier. None of that sounds particularly enticing, but the company knows changes need to be made. It divested a number of its smaller businesses and some of its real estate holdings and sold 30% of DirecTV to streamline operations and free up capital for the expansion of its 5G network, which could be huge. AT&T is still a risky buy with its stumbles this year, but if you believe in the turnaround plan, the anxiety might be worthwhile. Big picture, AT&T continues to boast the scale advantages required to compete in the high-growth wireless space long term. With elite investors like Charlie Munger, Michael Burry and Jeremy Grantham all saying the market is due for a correction, it might be worth looking into investments other than stocks. There’s no shortage of unique alternative assets you can invest in that have little correlation with the stock market, including luxury vehicles, commercial real estate, blue-chip artworks or even marine finance. Traditionally, many alternative asset classes have only been available to millionaires because of the enormous costs involved. But a new platform is making these opportunities available to retail investors too. This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

12/13/2021,"While you might never see another stimulus check from Washington, drivers across the country are still getting cash in the mail from their insurers. Car insurance companies have been squeezed for more money ever since last year, when they made huge profits and offered only modest discounts and rebates in return. Now a new wave of $400 refunds is coming to some drivers after a group of insurers were accused of hoarding billions in surplus cash. If you feel like you've been paying too much for your coverage, here's how to get your own check — or at least get a break from your insurer. The latest round of refunds is coming to drivers in Michigan, who are getting $400 back for each vehicle they own. “Billions in surplus funds should not be held by insurers to invest for their own profit or be conditioned on renewal of a policy,” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer wrote in a letter last month. Whitmer had accused the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association — which charges drivers an annual fee to cover the cost of personal injury claims — of holding on to $5 billion more than necessary. The insurance companies that make up the association quickly agreed to part with roughly $3 billion of the surplus. The money will be freed up in early March and distributed to policyholders within 60 days. While the refund is welcome relief, it's only a one-time deal — meaning drivers in Michigan and across the country will need to look elsewhere for significant, lasting savings. Though it's not the case in Michigan, most complaints in other states are related to overcharging during the pandemic. When the streets were empty and accidents few, Progressive reported an 82% increase in net income. Geico’s pretax earnings tripled during the second and third quarters of 2020. Insurance providers voluntarily gave out more than $14 billion in refunds last year, the American Property Casualty Insurance Association says, but many critics aren't satisfied. “On behalf of consumers, I am out of patience,” California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara wrote in October, giving three of the stingier companies 30 days to ""tell us once and for all how they are going to make it right.” A state analysis found that insurers returned an average of 9% of auto premiums from March to September 2020, but the Insurance Department estimates they should have refunded nearly double that amount. Washington and New Mexico are also assessing whether drivers got enough money back, and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey has sent several pointed letters to the state's insurance regulator. The conflict has even ended up in the courts, with class-action lawsuits filed this year in Nevada and Illinois. Unless more regulators step in or the class-action suits succeed, insurers won’t be forced by law to hand out more money than they already have. Most rebates provided last year were minimal; it was rare to get back more than half a month’s premium. On average, advocacy groups say, insurers shortchanged policyholders $125 per vehicle. But some companies didn’t issue refunds or cut rates at all unless customers called and asked. If you haven’t contacted your insurer yet, you might have free cash waiting for you. And with pressure mounting, your provider might be open to reviewing your premium, especially if you’re still driving less than before. But if your insurance company refuses to give you a pandemic discount, you can try a couple other ways to cut your insurance bill: Some auto insurance policies include extras that you may be able to do without for a while. For example, can you cut out the option that pays for a rental car while yours is at the repair shop? Removing these extras can save you a few bucks. Just make sure you’re still meeting your state’s minimum liability coverage and are protected in case of an accident during those trips to the grocery store. If your insurer won’t give you a break, maybe you can find a new one that will. Drivers who haven’t done any comparison shopping over the last six months could be overpaying by more than $1,000 per year. With a free quote-comparing service, you could find a better price in just a few minutes. If saving on car insurance isn’t enough, here are a few more ways to give your bank account a boost until the economy bounces all the way back. Stop overpaying online. It’s impossible to find the best price on your own when there are thousands of stores on the internet. Try using a free browser extension that automatically applies coupon codes and tracks down lower prices when you shop online. Cut the cost of your debt. If you’ve relied on credit cards throughout the pandemic, expensive interest is bound to catch up with you. A lower-interest debt consolidation loan can fold your balances into a single, lower-interest payment — and help you find freedom from your debt sooner. Invest your spare change. Using a popular investing app, you can automatically invest the “change” left over from everyday purchases. You won't even notice the deposits as you build or round out your investing plan.

12/13/2021,"With the arrival of the new omicron variant, it’s fair — and fairly depressing at this point — to wonder if the COVID-19 pandemic might weigh on the economy for yet another year. But it’s not a worry for America’s biggest bank. In a message shared recently with clients, JPMorgan Chase global research leader Marko Kolanovic says, ""Our view is that 2022 will be the year of a full global recovery, an end of the pandemic, and a return to normal economic and market conditions we had prior to the COVID-19 outbreak.” JPMorgan is forecasting strong consumer spending and the return of mobility, Kolanovic says. Put those things together and you’ve got a recipe for a serious bounceback in the travel industry. Here are three travel companies to watch. They’re already feeling the positive effects of people venturing away from home more, so 2022 should be brighter for their share prices if the rebound sticks. You may even be able to build a portfolio that includes some travel stocks like these using a few spare pennies. You might think that the pandemic would have annihilated a vacation rental company because so many people cut back on travel, but Airbnb’s stock is up 30% since the start of the year. There are several reasons why Airbnb remains attractive, even with omicron uncertainty hanging in the air. The Airbnb app remains a first option for many travelers who abandoned traditional hotels. If those travelers hope to avoid crowds, staying in an Airbnb provides more social distancing than a hotel. And once the pandemic has passed and rental demand in city centers returns, there will be no shortage of real estate investors fashioning apartments and condos into Airbnb rentals. The company just wrapped up the best quarter in its brief history. Q3 saw Airbnb rake in more than $2.2 billion in revenue, a 67% year-over-year increase. Net profits for the quarter were $834 million. Carnival, America’s largest cruise operator, has not fared as well as Airbnb. Since mid-January 2020, the cruise ship operator has seen its share price sink by about 63%. That’ll happen when numerous COVID outbreaks on boats have the world thinking your product is a floating germ lab. But the global cruise industry is alive and kicking. In December, 68 brands are set to operate 239 cruise ships, according to Cruise Industry News, which predicts major companies will be back to operating a large part of their fleets by early 2022. The rebound in demand has analysts forecasting a return to profitability for Carnival next year. That’ll be welcome news because 2021 has been awful. Carnival posted a net loss of $2 billion in the third quarter alone. But the company also had $7.8 billion in liquidity at the end of Q3, which the company says will be enough to return it to full operations. Booking Holdings is a lot more than just Booking.com. The company owns several popular travel fare aggregators, including Priceline, Agoda, Kayak, Cheapflights and even restaurant reservation platform OpenTable. In 2019, the last full year before the pandemic, consumers booked 845 million room nights, 77 million rental car days and 7 million airplane tickets through websites owned by Booking Holdings. With little opportunity for competitors to swoop in and absorb its market share in the last two years, the company stands to continue as a dominant player in the travel booking space. Booking is already reaping the benefits of rising demand from travelers. It brought in almost $4.7 billion in revenue in the third quarter, a 77% increase over the same period last year. Since the start of 2021, Bookings share price has increased almost 5%. Nothing against JPMorgan, but no one can truly predict what next year will mean for the stock market. A number of prominent investors have said it’s due for a historical correction. If you want to invest in something that avoids the queasy up-and-down of the stock market, it might be time to take a look at some under-the-radar alternative assets. The choices are as broad as they are intriguing. Exotic vehicles, marine finance, commercial real estate — these are just a few of the asset classes that fall under the “alternative” umbrella. Traditionally, these off-the-beaten-path options have been inaccessible to the average investor. But a new platform puts these exciting opportunities well within your reach.
