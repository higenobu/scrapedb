3/4/2022,"Allegations Ben Roberts-Smith kicked an unarmed, handcuffed detainee off a cliff in Afghanistan were reported to senior command within the SAS in 2013, but no action was taken, with the regimental sergeant major saying it was “over his head”, the federal court has been told. Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross and one of Australia’s most decorated soldiers, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. One of the key allegations made against Roberts-Smith concerns a 2012 SAS mission to the village of Darwan in Uruzgan province. The trial has heard evidence from a former SAS soldier, anonymised before court as Person 4, that he saw Roberts-Smith during that operation kick an unarmed, handcuffed and captive Afghan man in the chest, “catapulting him” off a cliff. “I saw the individual smash his face on a rock, and I saw the teeth explode out of his face,” he told the court. Person 4 said the Australian soldiers then walked down a track to the bottom of the cliff where Roberts-Smith ordered him and another subordinate soldier to drag the badly injured man under a tree, where he was shot by the other soldier after discussion with Roberts-Smith. On Friday afternoon in the federal court, another former comrade of Roberts-Smith, a still-serving member of the SAS anonymised as Person 18, said Person 4 had broken down during a drinking session later in 2012, back in Australia, as he recounted the event. “He said ‘I watched Ben Roberts-Smith kick a detainee off a cliff’,” Person 18 told the court. Person 18 said a meeting was organised with the SAS regimental Sergeant Major in early 2013 to discuss the allegation. “The RSM [regimental sergeant major] said, words to the effect of, ‘it was out of his hands, it was way over his head, he honestly didn’t know what to do with it’.” Person 18 said no further action was taken. “The outcome of the first meeting wasn’t … it wasn’t receptive,” he told the court. In 2014, in another meeting with a new regimental sergeant major, the allegation was raised again. “[In this meeting] Person 4 said the same thing: ‘They were conducting a mission in Darwan, they had detained persons in Darwan … he turned around and he saw his team commander kick a detainee off a cliff’.” Person 18 said the regimental sergeant major “had a list of topics he wanted to talk to us about”. “It was the allegations that something had happened during 2012 rotation; allegations of things that had happened in 2009; discrepancies between people in regards to Tizak [the site of a battle in 2010]; allegations of bullying; he went through each one of these, asking what we knew. “The main thing I recall was Person 4 talking about Darwan … he broke down in the office.” Roberts-Smith has denied ever kicking anybody off a cliff. In his evidence before the court last year, Roberts-Smith said the alleged version of events in Darwan could not have happened because “there was no cliff … there was no kick”, and that the slain man was an enemy “spotter” who was discovered hiding in a cornfield carrying a radio, and was lawfully killed within the military’s rules of engagement. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Person 18 also gave evidence to the court he had received two letters posted to him at the SAS’s barracks in Perth, threatening that he would “go down” for murder if he didn’t recant evidence given to a military inquiry into alleged war crimes committed by Australian troops in Afghanistan, led by Justice Paul Brereton. That inquiry reported in 2020, finding evidence of 39 murders of civilians and prisoners by, or at the instruction of, members of Australian special forces. Twenty-five ADF personnel were reported to be involved. Person 18 said he received the letters in June 2018, after he had given an initial interview to the inquiry and having been informed he was required for a second interview. The court has previously heard that the letters said:“You and others have worked together to spread lies and rumours to the media and the inspector general’s inquiry. You have one chance to save yourself. You must approach the inquiry and admit that you have colluded with others to spread lies. “We are very aware of your many murderous actions over many tours in Afghanistan, including specific dates … just like when you took part in the execution of two persons-under-control at Tizak. You know what you have done and so do we. “Don’t forget this because it will not go away. You will go down, better to take a reprimand than murder charges.” The letters were signed “a friend of the regiment”. The newspapers have alleged during this trial that Roberts-Smith was the author of the letters, claiming Roberts-Smith wore gloves to prepare and print off the documents at the offices of Channel Seven, bought stamps from a number of different shops and instructed a private investigator to address and mail the sealed envelopes he had placed them in. The court has also heard evidence from Roberts-Smith’s ex-wife, Emma Roberts, that she confronted Roberts-Smith over the letters when their contents were publicly reported. Roberts told the court she asked Roberts-Smith: “What the fuck have you done?” She also told the court: “He told me he had written the letters, had printed them at the Seven office, had sealed them in the envelopes, addressed them, and had given them to [family friend and occasional employee] John McLeod to post.” McLeod, a former police officer-cum-private investigator, also gave evidence to the court that he was given four envelopes to post by Roberts-Smith during a meeting at a Brisbane Bunnings, and was later sent Person 18’s name and PO box address at the barracks. McLeod said he posted two of the envelopes and gave the other two to police. In his evidence last year, Roberts-Smith denied any involvement in the letters and said the conversation with his wife never occurred. “That’s not true,” he told the court. Person 18 remains in the witness box.

3/4/2022,"Wake up, roll over, check the phone for news from Kyiv. It’s becoming a habit now, a strange new morning routine, and not just for journalists whose working days have long dawned like this. Millions are now following this war in real time on social media, immersed in it more intimately and personally than ever before. If the advent of 24-hour rolling TV news brought audiences at home closer to faraway conflicts, subtly changing our understanding of them, then smartphones have put war right into the palms of our hands. Doomscrolling is becoming an addiction, although doom seems the wrong word for a conflict where horror mingles with so many stories of hope and inspiration; stories with the shimmering qualities of modern myths, viral and unforgettable, if not always instantly verifiable, and often helpfully translated into English. The young Ukrainian sapper said to have heroically blown himself up along with the bridge he was charged with destroying in order to slow the Russian advance. The villagers filmed courageously standing in front of tanks. The female MPs posting pictures of themselves training to use rifles, and the soldiers of Snake Island greeting demands for their surrender with the now famous response: “Russian warship, go fuck yourself.” (Like a new No pasarán, that slogan is everywhere; splashed on T-shirts sold in aid of Ukrainian charities, even iced on cookies sold by a Texas bakery.) And then there is the tale of how President Volodymyr Zelenskiy supposedly rebuffed an American offer to whisk him to safety with the words “I need ammunition, not a ride.” War has transformed a former comic actor once mocked for his hamminess into an iconic leader for the times whose powerfully emotive short videos posted from beneath his bombed capital seem made for sharing: a real-life Scheherazade, telling captivating tales to the world in the hope of keeping his countrymen alive for one more night. To talk of stories sounds frivolous, when war crimes are almost certainly now unfolding. But the bleaker the news from the front, as Russian troops begin encircling cities and shelling civilians into submission, the more they matter. Hopelessness makes the rest of the world look away because it’s all too much to take, or else share well-meaning posts about how it’s fine to switch off the news if it makes you sad and do some yoga instead. Hope, on the other hand, keeps people emotionally invested, both at home and abroad; energises us to give to charities, pressure governments to act and big companies to disinvest, and sturdily accept the sacrifices now looming as prices of gas, oil, wheat and raw materials soar. Polling for ITV last week found a resolute 68% of Britons agreeing the government should impose whatever economic sanctions are effective, even if that raises energy prices, although feelings may change when bills start hitting doormats. But strategic communications (to give stories their technical name) perhaps matter most if, as the foreign secretary insists, Nato member states are digging in for the long haul. For years now Russia has brilliantly exploited the storytelling power of social media to manipulate emotions and destabilise governments across Europe. Its army of bots, trolls and useful idiots has stoked culture wars, amplified conspiracy theories, spread fake news and latched on to any glimmering of doubt and division, while the liberal west has largely floundered in response. Now something has shifted. Social media giants have been at least briefly galvanised into action, with Google blocking the propaganda channels Russia Today and Sputnik on YouTube in Europe and Meta (nee Facebook) targeting disinformation networks. The BBC is racking up new listeners in Russia suddenly hungry for the reality-based reporting they can’t get at home. Next time our own government attacks the BBC, remember it’s going for the home of Lyse Doucet, calmly broadcasting under shelling, and of 3am World Service bulletins that reach people too scared to sleep. It’s striking, too, how openly western intelligence communities have shared information about Russian invasion plans and supposed Russian operational difficulties, as if taunting a paranoid Kremlin about its apparent leakiness. For the first time in years, it feels as if the west is telling its story with confidence again – an age-old tale of liberal values versus tyranny, but given new life by a democracy young enough not to take freedom for granted. What remains elusive so far, however, is the sense of a happy ending. If this war had been scripted in Hollywood then it would end just as the mayor of Lviv suggested, with oligarchs’ mansions in London being seized and used to house Ukrainian refugees, although only until those refugees could triumphantly return home. But in real life nobody yet has a convincing narrative for how Vladimir Putin can be stopped, given Nato countries’ understandable reluctance to use force against a leader threatening nuclear Armageddon. Diplomatic hopes seem pinned on China helping to broker some kind of peace, though that would mean yet another tectonic shift in global alliances, with unpredictable consequences. And meanwhile that murderous convoy inches closer every day to Ukraine’s capital, evoking grim memories of how Russian siege tactics ended in Grozny and Aleppo. But every day that Zelenskiy evades assassination, every night Kyiv can hold out, feels like a miracle now. That’s why we can’t stop ourselves compulsively checking for news. Just one more night. Just one more story. Just one more hopeful morning.

3/4/2022,"The TV feels like the third person in the room. Brendan will even initiate sex while a film is playing If you have problems with sleep, you need good sleep hygiene: go to bed at the same time every night, don’t work in the bed, and no screen time. But my boyfriend, Brendan, says he can’t fall asleep unless the TV is on. He likes to watch Scorsese and Tarantino films before bed. There’s loads of noise, violence and action coming from our TV – a large flatscreen that gives off loads of light and keeps me awake. It’s been like this since I moved in with him six months ago. I knew he had problems with sleep before; when he stayed at mine he often needed to listen to a podcast before bed (I didn’t have a TV in the bedroom). But since I’ve moved into his place, I’ve realised how bad his sleep habits are. I complained about it, but Brendan just suggested I should use an eye mask to block the light out. I tried that but the noise still kept me awake, even when he turned it down low, so he started using earphones. I then tried wearing my mask while he watched TV with his AirPods in, but it felt ridiculous. I read a book instead, but Brendan didn’t want me to have the light on. Now I read my Kindle with the backlight on until he falls asleep. I have to wait for him to doze off, then I get out of bed, turn the TV off and keep reading until I get drowsy. If I wasn’t there, Brendan would just leave the TV on all night. The bedroom is a sacred space. When you go to sleep with a partner, you expect to get close and intimate, but a television ruins that. I also like the element of play and mystery at night, wondering if we will kiss when we get into bed. But suddenly I’m in a relationship where the TV is always on and it feels like there is a third person in the room. It kills the mood. Sometimes Brendan will initiate sex while a film is playing, which I find distracting and quite rude. It feels like he’s making half an effort. The bed should be a place to cuddle and connect. Brendan needs to see a sleep specialist because his habits are affecting our relationship and my sleep. Charlotte reads on her Kindle and I drift off the way I like – I don’t see the issue I’ve always needed a bit of background noise to help me drift off to sleep, and Charlotte has always known this. When I used to stay over at hers, I would put my AirPods in and listen to something before bed. She was fine with that. But now she’s moved into my place, where I like to watch television in bed before sleeping. I know people say exposure to artificial light before sleep is bad for you, but there’s something comforting about having a film on in the background. I find it really soothing and it helps me switch off. I suggested that Charlotte use an eye mask, and she was more than happy to give it a go. It seemed to work well for a little while – I would turn the TV volume down really low, and she wouldn’t be affected by the light as her eyes were covered. But then she said it wasn’t good enough, so I offered to listen to the TV with my headphones. Now she reads on her Kindle while I watch TV on my AirPods – I also turn the brightness down on the TV. I get to drift off the way I like. I’m not really sure what the issue is. Charlotte says she doesn’t like the idea of us doing different things in bed, but the reality is we can’t always be in sync. We both work from home so we do spend a lot of time together. We make sure we have date nights. A couple of times we did get intimate with the TV on and it seemed fine. But later Charlotte told me she found it distracting. I’ve taken that onboard, but she needs to be more upfront with her feelings at the time. I disagree that we aren’t as intimate because there’s a TV in the bedroom – it doesn’t affect our sex life in any way. We could both make more of an effort to go to bed earlier. Sometimes we stay up until 1am for no real reason, though Charlotte is more of a night owl than me. I’m up for working on a better sleep schedule, both for my own health and Charlotte’s. But if I still can’t sleep, the television will just have to go back on and Charlotte can use her eye mask. Should Brendan say farewell to his all-night films? Brendan has a myopic, selfish viewpoint. He should try reading comics in bed. Scheduled intimacy is a rubbish solution. The best intimacy is spontaneous and in the moment. It results in sleep of the highest quality.Graham, 56 It feels like Brendan wants oblivion to claim him without his ever having been fully present – either with Charlotte or alone with his thoughts. She must keep her eyes open until Tarantino has soothed Brendan to sleep, then get up and turn the TV off: that’s unfair.Isabel, 70 Charlotte is right – bedrooms are for sleep and sex, not for watching TV. If Brendan were aware of Charlotte’s feelings, he would move the TV into the living room and watch it there. Turn it off and grow up!Michael, 23 Brendan is deluding himself if he thinks Scorsese and Tarantino films are helping him to sleep. Charlotte should tell him to take a sleep therapy course.Carolyn, 77 Perhaps Brendan is struggling to adapt to someone moving into his space, but Charlotte also has needs. She’s found herself in a love triangle with an overexcited TV. He should extinguish his old flame and switch to an iPad beside her Kindle.Amy, 38 So now you can be the judge: click on the poll below to tell us if Brendan should stop watching TV in bed.

3/4/2022,"At the train station in Przemyśl in Poland, thousands of refugees fleeing the Russian invasion of Ukraine get off the carriages every day, seeking asylum in Europe. As they arrive, dozens of Polish border guards and soldiers distribute food, water, blankets and hot tea with a smile. I look on as the soldiers help Ukrainian women and children with their heavy luggage. I watch as they play with the children and caress their faces. As the scene unfolds, I can’t help but think that this is the same border force which, for months, a short distance north, along the same eastern border, has been violently pushing back asylum seekers from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan who attempt to cross the frontier from Belarus. It is the same border force which, instead of offering a caring touch and a comforting smile, brutally beat the refugees from Aleppo, who are also victims of Vladimir Putin’s bombardments. In Przemyśl, the Ukrainians are served hot drinks. At the Belarusian border, at least 19 migrants have died in the frigid forests. Last winter, I covered for the Guardian the refugee crisis between Poland and Belarus, when the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, was accused of organising the movement of refugees, who were lured with the promise of safe passage to Europe, in reprisal for the sanctions Brussels had imposed on his regime. Forgive me, but I cannot come to terms with the stark difference between the outpouring of kindness towards Ukrainian refugees and the uncertain fate of thousands of asylum seekers from the Middle East, trapped between the violence of the Polish authorities and false promises of the Belarusians. I cannot hold back the rage I feel for the Yazidi families who fought against Islamic State, but who were being forced to live in small tents in the woods at the European border, struggling to keep warm in damp sleeping bags as night-time temperatures fall below zero. Forgive me if, in contrast with the hospitality shown to Ukrainian refugees, I cannot help but think of the Syrian and Kurdish men and women caught by Polish border guards and illegally and violently pushed back to Belarus. As I’ve covered the exodus of Ukrainian refugees escaping the Russian invasion, I have noticed a growing number of people from Pakistan, Ghana, Morocco and Somalia, mainly students, who have just arrived at Przemyśl train station from cities in Ukraine. It is unclear whether the Polish authorities will allow them to stay. Some would like to go back to their home country but others fear being sent back. On Tuesday, just 100 metres from my hotel, dozens of Polish nationalists, dressed in black, targeted these groups of non-white refugees, chanting “go back to your country”. Three Indians were beaten up, leaving one of them having to be taken to hospital. After the incident, police in Poland warned that groups linked to the far right are already spreading false information about alleged crimes committed by people from Africa and the Middle East who are fleeing the violence in Ukraine. “It’s fake news,” the Polish authorities said. Despite the well-intentioned pronouncements of the Polish police, who on this occasion sided with the Middle Eastern and African refugees, I can’t help but think that these are the same authorities who, months earlier, while facing the humanitarian crisis at the border with Belarus, spoke of the risk of a migrant invasion from the Middle East and mobilised their troops to push them back. At that time, over four months the Middle Eastern asylum seekers attempting to enter Poland through Belarus numbered only a few thousand. If the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa welcomes up to 2,000 asylum seekers from Libya in a day, with political will Poland could have resolved the humanitarian crisis at the Belarusian border in a few days. An average of 50,000 Ukrainian refugees are entering Poland every day, which so far has taken in more than 500,000 people: at this rate, it could face Europe’s largest wave of refugees since the second world war. But while Warsaw regarded the arrival of a few thousand Syrian and Kurdish refugees as a significant political problem, the presence of more than half a million Ukrainians in their country seems to have become a badge of national pride for the Poles, who are now struggling to find space for them. At the station in Przemyśl, as I watch a Polish policeman console a tearful and distraught Ukrainian woman, I think about the 32-year-old woman from Syria I met last December in a makeshift dormitory in Bruzgi, Belarus. Since fleeing Idlib, she had been held up in Belarus with her mother who’d had a kidney transplant and needed medical help. I contemplate the different fate of two women who had both become victims of war: the Ukrainian who received a warm meal and a smile from the kind policeman and the other, a Syrian, who can only dream of receiving a fraction of that care and attention.",News/Global development,"Embraced or pushed back: on the Polish border, sadly, not all refugees are welcome | Lorenzo Tondo ",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/commentisfree/2022/mar/04/embraced-or-pushed-back-on-the-polish-border-sadly-not-all-refugees-are-welcome
3/4/2022,"A Northern Territory police officer charged with murder has denied making up aspects of his account of the shooting, including that the Aboriginal man he shot dead had his hand on his gun and that he believed he had seen the man stabbing his colleague. Constable Zachary Rolfe repeatedly disagreed with prosecutor Philip Strickland SC in the NT supreme court on Friday when asked whether he had made up parts of his story or rehearsed answers. Rolfe disputed Strickland’s suggestion that he knew he had “gone too far” and been “gung ho” when he shot dead Kumanjayi Walker. The court has heard Rolfe shot Walker three times while trying to arrest him on 9 November 2019 in the remote community of Yuendumu, about 300km from Alice Springs. Walker, a 19-year-old Warlpiri man, stabbed Rolfe with a pair of scissors shortly before the first shot was fired. Rolfe is not charged in relation to this shot. He is charged in relation to the second and third shots fired at Walker. He has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers have argued his actions on the day were justified in light of the risk that Walker posed to him and a colleague, the then-constable Adam Eberl. In his evidence on Thursday, Rolfe told the court that shortly after he was stabbed by Walker he placed his right hand on his Glock handgun, and noticed Walker’s left hand was already on it. He also said that he had seen Walker stabbing Eberl around the chest and neck area during the struggle, although he also clarified that was his impression or perception as he had not seen the scissors coming into contact with Eberl. The court has previously heard Eberl was found to have a small scratch under his left shoulder several days after the incident, but he has given evidence that he could not recall this injury having occurred during his struggle with Walker. On Friday, Strickland asked Rolfe to recount the shooting while showing him body-worn camera footage frame-by-frame. Rolfe agreed that the footage did not show Walker’s hand being on his gun and that he did not “think” it showed him stabbing Eberl. Edwardson has previously told the court to be mindful about the limitations of relying on body-worn camera footage to accurately show what an officer wearing that camera could actually see. Strickland asked Rolfe whether he had made up that Walker touched his gun, that he believed he saw Eberl being stabbed, and that he believed Eberl’s life was in danger when he fired the final two shots, with Rolfe denying each suggestion. He did clarify that at the time the second and third shots were fired he no longer felt there was a risk posed to himself by Walker. Strickland asked why, if Walker had touched his gun, Rolfe had not shouted a verbal warning to Eberl, or tell him immediately after the incident. Rolfe said it was not mentioned as it was the “least serious” thing that had happened, and agreed he also never told any other officer. He said he did not issue verbal warnings either about the gun or about Walker having a weapon because there had been no time to do so. Immediately after the shooting, Eberl asked Rolfe “did you, fuck”, which Rolfe has told the court he understood to be a query about whether he had shot Walker. Rolfe told the court on Thursday that he responded “it’s all good, he had scissors in his hand, he was stabbing me, he was stabbing you” because he believed Eberl was in a “heightened state” and “suffering from auditory exclusion” which meant he had not heard the shots. Strickland asked Rolfe on Friday whether he really had those thoughts at that time. “You’re making that up too aren’t you?” Strickland said. “No I’m not,” Rolfe responded. Strickland put it to Rolfe that he had answered Eberl in that way to justify what he had done, knowing the shooting had been captured on body-worn cameras. “Because constable, you knew you had gone too far?” he said. “Incorrect,” Rolfe answered. “You knew you had been too gung ho,” Strickland said. “Incorrect,” Rolfe said. Strickland asked Rolfe why he twice said “it’s all good” after the shooting, asking him “how was the situation all good”? “A violent offender was trying to murder two police officers and he no longer was,” Rolfe responded. Rolfe earlier told the court that during a 10-month break between a stint in the army and applying to join the NT police he spent four to five weeks training in the US state of Arkansas with Trojan Securities International. He said he paid for the private training himself, which included hostage rescue, counter ambush driving, and weapons familiarisation courses, to “upskill” himself. He was also asked multiple questions by Strickland about his training and the planning leading up to the shooting, which Strickland has previously described as important context to understanding the shooting itself. Rolfe confirmed he had not made any action plan regarding the decision to search a Yuendumu property known as House 511 before he entered, and agreed that he had been trained about the need for such a plan. He also agreed that he should have noticed Walker’s hand was in his pocket after he and Eberl entered the house. The court has heard that is where Walker is believed to have hidden the scissors. Rolfe denied suggestions put to him by Strickland that he had become obsessed or fixated with an incident three days before the shooting when Walker threatened two Yuendumu police officers with an axe. Strickland put to Rolfe that the reason he did not discuss any plan to arrest Walker with his colleagues was because he had already formed a clear plan in his mind to shoot Walker if he resisted arrest or presented a weapon to police. “Incorrect,” Rolfe said. Rolfe completed his evidence on Friday, but the defence plan to call a final witness when the trial resumes on Tuesday.",News/Australia news,Zachary Rolfe denies making up parts of his story of the shooting of Kumanjayi Walker,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/04/zachary-rolfe-denies-making-up-parts-of-his-story-of-the-shooting-of-kumanjayi-walker
3/4/2022,"The propagation of White supremacist propaganda in the United States remained at historically high levels in 2021 despite a small recent dip, a new study from the Anti-Defamation League has revealed. ADL’s research found that although 2021 data indicated a 5% drop in incidents of distributing white supremacist propaganda from 2020 – with 4,851 cases reported, compared with 5,125 the year before – the numbers remain at worryingly serious levels. Throughout 2021, white supremacist propaganda was reported in all states except Hawaii. The highest levels of propaganda activity occurred in Pennsylvania, Virginia, Texas, Massachusetts, Washington, Maryland and New York. There were also more actual events being held by extremist groups. “In 2021, ADL documented 108 white supremacist events, more than double the 53 events held in 2020, and the most events recorded in any of the past five years,” the ADL said on Thursday. The ADL found that in 2021, at least 38 white supremacist groups distributed propaganda, including pieces that presented Ashli Babbitt, a January 6 rioter, as a martyr for their cause. Other campaigns included ones that supported Kyle Rittenhouse – who shot and killed anti-racism protestors in Wisconsin – with propaganda pieces claiming “Kyle was right”. Among the 38 white supremacist groups tracked by the ADL, three groups – Patriot Front, New Jersey European Heritage Association (NJEHA) and Folkish Resistance Movement (FRM) – were found to be responsible for 91% of all propaganda activity. Patriot Front, a Texas-based alt-right group, was responsible for 3,992 of all the propaganda incidents in 2021, constituting more than 82% of nationwide incidents. According to ADL, the group distributed propaganda in every state except Hawaii and Alaska. The group’s activities were largely concentrated in Pennsylvania, Virginia, Massachusetts, Texas and Maryland and its members were responsible for 82% of propaganda distribution across college campuses and 94% of white supremacist stenciled graffiti. NJEHA was behind 219 propaganda incidents last year, making up 5% of the total nationwide propaganda activity, a 57% decrease from their 2020 efforts. Its activities were recorded in 28 states but were mostly concentrated in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York and Florida. NJEHA’s propaganda campaigns were found to have targeted various groups including Jewish people, Black people, immigrants or the LGBTQ+ community. Examples of their propaganda slogans include, “They hate you for being white”, “Stop the Third World invasion of America”, “There are only two genders”, “Black crimes matter”, and “Why are Jews censoring free speech?” FRM, a hate group created with the intent to spread national socialism, was responsible for the third highest number of propaganda incidents in 2021. Additionally, the group was responsible for 50% of antisemitic propaganda incidents last year. Its activities were recorded in 19 states but were mostly found in Minnesota, Mississippi, Arizona, Colorado and Texas. In addition to tracking white supremacist propaganda, the ADL also found that antisemitic propaganda distribution has skyrocketed compared to the previous year. The ADL recorded 352 propaganda incidents that included either antisemitic language or symbols, targeted Jewish institutions or both, marking a 27% jump from the previous year.",News/World news,US white supremacist propaganda was at historically high levels in 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/white-supremacist-propaganda-anti-defamation-league
3/4/2022,"Ayanna Lloyd Banwo’s debut is presented as a romance, but it also centres another kind of love: the complexity of mothering and its beautiful and terrible consequences. On the eve of her mother Petronella’s death, protagonist Yejide provides one of the book’s most haunting extended metaphors: “She only know her mother through moments meant for someone else.” As a child, she creeps after Petronella, watching her intense relationship with her aunt, her mother’s twin, and saving the memories of her own neglect in multicoloured boxes that she spreads out and looks at sometimes: a light blue box that “smells like loneliness”; a forest-green box, “wide with a false bottom”; another, black, “padlocked and humming”; a box in heavy purple, “like an unanswered question”. When We Were Birds moves between two characters, Yejide and Darwin, living in a fictionalised Trinidad, its rich urbanity so fondly drawn that it occasionally threatens to take over the narrative. Darwin was raised Rastafarian in the countryside by a devoted mother, the pair “living like their own island”. They fall out painfully when Darwin must take a city job as a gravedigger, defying scripture (Numbers 21:6 says “the Nazarite must not go near a dead body”). The scene where Darwin shears his head in order to work is tender and lonely and powerful, reminiscent of Kei Miller’s hymnal to Rastafarianism in his 2016 novel Augustown. As Darwin faces his financial responsibilities, Yejide has her own duty, and the community around her after her mother’s death – including beloved stepfather Peter and childhood friend and lover, Seema – expect her to claim it. According to the creation myth told by her grandmother, Yejide is the latest in a line of women transformed, hundreds of years ago, from corbeaux, or carrion birds, into human witnesses to the dead, ushering them into the afterlife. Now she must balance her own dreams with the needs of ghosts. She and Darwin have both been made older before their time as their parents hustled to survive. If European literature lionises the orphan trope, Black literature spotlights the uber-capable Black child and the complex effects of duty. The first half of the book introduces the couple before they meet and features some gorgeously sure writing. Like Trinidadian novelists before her, such as Monique Roffey and Ingrid Persaud, Lloyd Banwo wields patois with pride. She paints the fictional Port Angeles in glorious sound and motion, especially the graveyard Fidelis, this “city of bone”. Darwin is changed for ever, digging his first hole and watching a widower beside it: “Mr Julius make a sound like the end of a fight when you get so much blows that it eh even make sense to bawl anymore.” And the romance between Darwin and Yejide? There is no question that the novel ignites when they finally meet, first in a shared vision, and then to arrange Petronella’s burial. Lloyd Banwo conjures an aching sexual energy, places the lovers in deliciously paced jeopardy and takes the tale to an agreeably thundery climax. Still, there are first-novel weaknesses. Darwin’s sections are focused and precise, making for a satisfying romantic lead and a complex human being. Unfortunately, Yejide sometimes feels like a device created to express an idea: her family’s corbeaux legacy is increasingly overwrought and muddied, perhaps because Lloyd Banwo takes too much delight in explaining it to us. Yejide’s sections feel overpacked: with ideas and with minor characters, insufficiently delineated. It was good to see lesbian love made tenderly Caribbean – the mosquito nets and the rain – and so Yejide’s easy rejection of Seema feels disappointing, almost as if having a vision of Darwin in all his magnificent heterosexuality renders their long-time love merely childish. “What matters is your ancestors,” yells Seema, as Yejide prepares to abscond with her man. “And you don’t get to turn away from that because your mother didn’t love you enough.” There will be no perfect Hollywood ending, then – duty is clear and irrefutable. But is a balance possible? Can you ever leave the past behind for some flagrant idea of freedom? Should you? Ultimately, the text suggests that its characters are, at least in part, lovable and loving because of the sacrifices they continue to make, and that that is more than enough. “A small life is a life still, ent?” says Darwin, walking with his long-lost father. “You still think love is something nice,” hisses Petronella’s ghost, and her daughter is troubled, until she meets Darwin. Lloyd Banwo has written a love letter for Trinidad, to remind all of us that yes, love is still very, very nice indeed.  Leone Ross’s novel This One Sky Day is published by Faber.

When Arthur Mee visited the Somerset village of South Stoke in the 1930s as part of the prodigious research he undertook for his 40-volume guide to England’s counties, he recorded that “it lies in as fair a scene as Nature has given us from her chalice of beauty”. He wasn’t wrong. Only a smidgen south of Bath, but not subsumed into its edges, the village hides serenely in the hills, clinging to the steep-sided Cam Brook valley and swathed in sylvan green. In his paragraph on South Stoke, teetotaller Mee makes no mention of the Packhorse pub; he focuses instead on the fine 15th-century tithe barn and Grade II-listed church of Saint James, which has, he noted, “four of the biggest gargoyles we have seen”. But the Packhorse was certainly there at the time. And, thanks to a considerable local effort, it still is. The beefy limestone building housing the Packhorse was built in the 17th century – the carving above the door says 1674; dendrochronological testing of its beams suggests 1618 – while the earliest record of its status as a “beer house” is from 1847. Which is what it continued to be until 2012, when the pub was sold to a buyer with planning permission for conversion into a residential dwelling. Enraged locals set up the Save the Packhorse campaign, which led to the biggest community pub buyback project in this country to date. “The complexity of the negotiations, the scale of the restoration, the amount of money that was required … There was no easy aspect,” says Dom Moorhouse, who led the effort. The pub finally reopened in 2018. The pandemic threw up more challenges but the future is looking positive – a survey went out to customers in January 2022, and Moorhouse says: “The feedback is hugely positive; the pub is really cherished.” It’s also really good for walkers. Four routes can be downloaded from the pub’s website, and a suggestion that came out of that survey is the creation of a walkers’ club, maybe involving a guided walk with a meal at the end. But for now, I’m setting off on a loop on my own, to combine far south Cotswolds countryside with other impressive examples of preservation and community spirit. Heading east out of the village, I first pass the stone arches of the old brewery – long since closed – and then follow a lane, with that “fair scene” running off to the far horizon to my right; the Westbury White Horse gallops across a distant hill. Then I drop into handsome Horsecombe Vale, a steep, mud-sticky descent to a wooded stream and, a little way ahead, the eight-arch viaduct of the old Somerset & Dorset Joint Railway. Though the line, which once connected Bath and Bournemouth, fell foul of Beeching in 1966, in 2013 a section became the Two Tunnels Greenway, which includes 1,672 metre-long Combe Down Tunnel, the longest cycling and walking tunnel in the UK. I join the greenway at Tucking Mill. A right turn would take me into its once dark recesses (it is now lit and enlivened by an art installation), but I veer left instead, following the ashphalted old trackbed to Midford, with the jolly turrets of Midford Castle rising on the hillside above. Midford’s station platform now sits, quiet and bare of buildings, above the beer garden of the Hope & Anchor pub. But this used to be quite the transport hub. Descending from the railway and passing under another looming, defunct viaduct, I’m soon by the Somerset Coal Canal. Built around 1800 to tote the spoils from coal mines at nearby Radstock, it was killed off around 1900 by the very railway I’ve just left. However, many structures remain and, as is the way around these civic-minded parts, a group – the Somersetshire Coal Canal Society – is trying to restore it to full navigation. Continuing through the valley, which is alive with birdsong, I follow the towpath, now a grassy hump alongside a waterless trough. I pass a fine aqueduct sitting uselessly in a field, a stone bridge over nothing and, at Combe Hay, a flight of rare caisson locks – they numbered 22 back in the day – to overcome the 40-metre drop. I leave the canal to climb via Engine Wood and drop down into Combe Hay village. Mee said it was “like an end of the world” – and it’s certainly still sleepy. I don’t see a soul as I pass the old Wheatsheaf Inn and extraordinarily grand Georgian rectory. Then it’s back to the Cam Brook, sloshing through winter fields along a stretch of the long-distance Limestone Link, which I could follow right into the Mendips. Instead, having spent long enough scouring the banks for kingfishers, I peel off at Dunkerton to fall in step with the Romans: the Fosse Way – built in the first century AD to link Exeter and Lincoln – makes characteristically straight progress here, and I climb it northwards, flanked by trees and the ghosts of legionnaires. But not for too long. Soon I veer right, traversing scrubby slopes that, I know from past experience, are flush with wildflowers come summer, and which provide a balcony panorama of the hills rolling off to the south. It’s a prospect that reaches its optimum just before re-entering South Stoke, at the Millennium Viewpoint, an excellent 160-metre-high lookout with a sweeping stone bench, created to mark the year 2000. It was fundraised for by the villagers themselves, of course. The Packhorse isn’t just a pub, reckons Moorhouse, but a place of social connection. Patrons come from down the road and around the globe to warm up by the fire in the gnarly-beamed Tap Room or sip a pint of Midford-made Honey’s cider outside – more than 1,000 volunteer hours went into the garden, including the planting of more than 200 species. While the building, with its wonky casement windows, metre-thick walls and Georgian inglenook (which may or may not have a secret tunnel leading to the church) is worthy of a pilgrimage, so is the food: locally sourced ingredients made into classics done well. The hotpot for two (£32), with lamb, smoked bacon, dumplings and half a roast chicken, has fast become a signature dish of new head chef Mark Marshall, who is brimming with fresh ideas. The return of live music – not least the summer Packstock mini-festival – is on the cards, too.packhorsebath.co.uk The Packhorse doesn’t offer accommodation. But the city of Bath is less than three miles away – a short bus ride or a tenner in a taxi – and there are many options there: try Eight (doubles from £110, breakfast extra), a classy little hotel spread over two townhouses. Or stay along the walking route in Combe Hay at the aforementioned Wheatsheaf (doubles from £120 B&B), another fine village pub that has been serving wayfarers since the 18th century.",Lifestyle/Travel,"A great walk to a great pub: the Packhorse, near Bath, Somerset",https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/mar/04/a-great-walk-to-a-great-pub-the-packhorse-near-bath-somerset
