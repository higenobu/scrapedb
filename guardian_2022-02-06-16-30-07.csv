2/6/2022,"Trees, eagles, bears, turrets and towers: passport designs used to follow certain conventions. Not any more. From Monday, all new Belgian passports will feature Tintin, the Smurfs and other heroes of Belgian comic-strip art. With a 34-page standard passport, Belgian travellers will be accompanied by Lucky Luke, Blake and Mortimer, and Bob and Bobette. Many images are from the original strips, such as the 1954 Tintin serial, Explorers on the Moon, where the intrepid boy reporter took his first steps on the lunar surface 15 years before Neil Armstrong. Others were specially designed for the passport, such as a Smurf contemplating a globe, with its knapsack and maps spread on the ground.  “We have chosen a design that represents well our country, its arts and culture, with a touch of talent, expertise, humour and humility,” Belgium’s foreign minister, Sophie Wilmès, told the Francophone national broadcaster RTBF. Comic strips, or bande dessinée, celebrated in Belgium and France as “the ninth art”’, remain wildly popular, although no longer get the same space in daily newspapers as they did during their postwar heyday. Tintin, created by Georges Remi under the penname Hergé in 1929, was the first big hit. Soon after the second world war came Blake and Mortimer, an MI5 agent and nuclear physicist, two British gentleman in a permanent quest to outsmart the dastardly Colonel Olrik. In 1958 arrived a band of little blue people living in a mushroom village, dreamed up after the artist Pierre Culliford, who used the pseudonym Peyo, couldn’t remember the word for salt during a meal with a fellow cartoonist and asked for le schtroumpf, translated into English as “smurf”. Michel Kichka, a celebrated Belgian-Israeli cartoonist, said it was a wonderful idea to put comic-book characters into the passport. “These characters, and the spirit that they represent, are close to the heart of the Belgians,” he told the Observer. “They are a part of the way I draw today.” Growing up in the city of Liège, he dreamed of being a cowboy like Lucky Luke, whose wild west adventures featured in the bestselling Spirou magazine. “At a time when TV and screens were not so strong, I spent so many hours reading comics.” The classic Belgian comics had a particular look, even when compared to the French ones, he said. “In the golden age of Belgian comics in the 1960s, all the characters were cute and friendly, they were with humour and they were drawn in a soft style, which is different to the style today.” Border guards will be treated to the full richness of the Belgian passport. While the naked eye sees a silhouette of a scene, other details, such as facial expressions and textures are revealed only under UV light, a security feature. “There is a little bit of Belgian humour here,” Wouter Poels, a foreign ministry spokesman said. “It’s always nice if you can link what is functionable to something that is enjoyable. But a passport is and remains an administrative document,” he said referring to 48 new security features, such as barcodes, laser-engraved photographs and the polycarbonate ID page. The passport scenes are inspired by travel and unsurprisingly avoid controversies, such as Tintin in the Congo, which is no longer sold in children’s sections of bookstores in the UK over its racist stereotypes. Nor does Lucky Luke smoke a cigarette. The cowboy, created in 1947 by Maurice de Bevere, also known as Morris, quit in 1988. Passport expert Tom Topol said: “Until the early 21st century passports were boring… [but] in the last 20 years passport design is becoming fancier.” Estonia’s passport features a night sky that twinkles under a UV ray; Finland’s has a moose that runs as pages flick; Japan’s latest document features the Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji series by Katsushika Hokusai, the renowned artist of the “floating world” school. “Yes, they look prettier, but the critical factor remains security,” Topol said, adding that it’s harder to forge or doctor complex designs. “Nowadays, a passport design with monotone graphic elements is just too simple.” But it is the design that has captured imaginations. “A reason to become Belgian,” tweeted one senior EU official in Brussels.",News/World news,Tintin’s world adventure: comic strip hero joins the Smurfs on new Belgian passport,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/06/tintins-world-adventure-comic-strip-hero-joins-the-smurfs-on-new-belgian-passport
2/6/2022,"The signs are painted on every wall and hang from every lamp-post of this small Gujarat village. “Easy Canada visa, student and immigration,” states one. “Study in Canada, free application, spouse can apply,” claims another. Indeed, in Dingucha, a village in rural east India, almost every house now has a family member either in Canada or the USA. It was a fact they used to proudly shout from the rooftops; but now, the village has fallen silent. Ask people about their relatives in north America – particularly the journey they took to get there – and they shrug their shoulders and walk off nervously.  It was a family of four – Jagdish Patel, 39, his wife Vaishali, 37, 11-year-old daughter Vihangi and three-year-old sin Dharmik – who set off from Dingucha on 10 January, with Canada visitor visas stamped in their passports. They landed in Toronto on 12 January. Patel called his father and cousin back in India to let them know that it was cold, but they were all fine and in a hotel. Six days later, the young family arrived in Emerson, a tiny town on the Canada-US border where night-time temperatures regularly drop below -35 degrees centigrade in the winter. It appears they were dropped off at a nearby point in brand new coats and gloves, and then began making the treacherous journey to America on foot, in the pitch dark, through what one local described as a freezing, “lunar-like landscape”. The next night, the Patel family were discovered frozen to death in the snow, 12 metres away from the US border. The “mind-blowing tragedy” – as it was described by Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau – has thrown a spotlight on the many Indians who continue to embark on often treacherous journeys to North America. Though India is developing fast, it is also plagued by sluggish economic growth, low wages and a lack of employment opportunities that have led to an ongoing jobs crisis. In January riots broke out in the Indian state of Bihar when around 10 million people applied for 40,000 jobs on the railways. Over 75% of the population is still employed in the informal sector, where people earn only a few hundred rupees a day and there is no job security or benefits. In the formal sector, the unemployment rate has recently hit 8% as increasing numbers are going into higher education but failing to find non-blue collar jobs once they leave. Though Gujarat, the state where Patel lived, has the lowest unemployment rate in the country, 95% of the jobless are educated. In Dingucha, most still make their living from farming fruit, wheat, cotton and spices. But Patel, who was the son of a farmer, was educated and before the pandemic had worked at a school in nearby Gandhinagar. However, over the last two years, after the school closed, he had moved his family back into his parent’s home in Dingucha and helped out in his brother’s garment factory and on his father’s farm. Dingucha village head Mathur Jithakor, 64, described Patel as a “nice quiet man, very honest, a hard worker.” “His livelihood seemed fine, but many people in our village have gone to Canada and the US and live good lives there, earning good money,” said Jithakor. “So that’s probably where he got the idea from.” According to villager, Patel’s uncle and cousins lived in the US. The news of Patel’s death has been greeted by a nervousness that the booming local business of facilitating visas to the US and Canada is now under international scrutiny. Agents, who charge vast sums, help people obtain visitor visas or student visas at dubious institutions in Canada, which they then illegally overstay. For those wishing to enter the US, the usual route is to go via Mexico or Canada and illegally cross the land border. By local estimates, more than 2,000 people from Dingucha have over the decades have gone to the US and Canada, and the money they have sent back has built several temples, the water tower, a school and multi-storey residences. “The whole village is scared that because of this incident, their relatives in America and Canada will be found and deported, so everyone has been told to shut their mouths,” said one village resident. Patel’s cousin Jaswant Patel claimed to know few details. “It was only when Jagdish arrived in Canada that he called me,” he said. “He sounded happy on the phone but he did not mention plans to go on to America.” Due to the high cost of flying home the bodies, the family would be buried in Canada, he added. But locals said that the high cost of paying an agent to facilitate these journeys to north America usually meant the whole family was involved in loaning the money. According to a Dingucha resident who had previous experience with the local visa agents, the standard cost for a family of four to get to the US is 16.5bn rupees (£164,000) – a staggering sum, particularly for a rural farming community. However, Patel’s father, a farmer, is said to have paid half the sum in cash for his son’s travel to the US and the other half in the form of 20 acres of land. The agents are now the focus on an investigation by India’s central Crime Investigation Department, who this week sent officers from the anti-human trafficking unit to the towns and cities around Dingucha where these agents operate. In the US and Canada, 13 agents allegedly facilitating illegal trafficking from India have been detained. Anil Pratham, assistant director general of police in Gandhinagar, Gujarat’s capital, said they were “still waiting for information from the Canadian authorities” about the identities of seven other Gujaratis, said to be from villages neighboruing Dingucha, who were rescued alive a few miles way from the Patel family. Police in Canada at first said the victims found in the blizzard included a boy in his teens and a baby, but Indian consular officials later confirmed the Patels’ identity. (The Royal Canadian Mounted Police did not respond to repeated requests for an explanation of the inaccurate initial report.) While Canadian officials have said they hope the tragedy that befell the Patels would ward off those thinking about making the illegal journey, the appetite in Dingucha for a future in Canada or the US appeared not have waned. Ashok Prajapati, 53, a local artist, said he hoped to send both his children to Canada, and that his 18-year-old son was currently waiting to hear about a student visa. “Everybody who is smart is trying to go,” he said.",News/World news,‘Mind-blowing tragedy’: deaths of Indian family at US-Canada border put visa sales under scrutiny,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/06/mind-blowing-tragedy-deaths-of-indian-family-at-us-canada-border-put-visa-sales-under-scrutiny
2/6/2022,"The US is nearing 900,000 confirmed deaths from Covid-19, the highest figure of any nation. The death toll would be equivalent to the 15th most populous city in the country, more than San Francisco, Washington DC or Boston – a city of ghosts with its population swelling each day. It’s not just the total numbers. America also has the highest death rate of any wealthy country, with half of the deaths occurring after vaccines became available.  The US has never responded to the Covid pandemic in a sustained, proactive way as a unified nation. Instead, much of the responsibility – and blame – has fallen on individuals. In a country with vast income inequality, poor health and sharp political divides, the results have been grim. “All of those factors put people at higher risk of Covid death,” said Megan Ranney, emergency physician and academic dean of public health at Brown University. Vaccinations, in particular, have lagged, especially compared with other wealthy countries. The health system was already precarious when it began to be battered by wave after wave of Covid. Other countries with similarly high death tolls earlier in the pandemic have seen fewer fatalities from the Omicron variant – yet in the US, the Omicron death toll is surpassing the Delta wave of autumn 2021. Last month was one of the deadliest of the entire pandemic. Meanwhile, American leaders are attempting to mimic other countries’ return to normal, despite a markedly different situation with hospitalizations and deaths – which, every day, nearly reach the losses from the September 11 terrorist attacks. “The first and most obvious [issue] is our vaccination and booster rate,” said Ranney. “Our rate of vaccination, period, is lower than in most other high-income countries, and our booster rate is lower as well. And as ample CDC data proves, vaccines and boosters are tremendously effective at protecting against death, even with Omicron.” Less than two-thirds – about 64% – of Americans are vaccinated, and only 48% of those are boosted, despite ample vaccine supply. “For a country which has a vaccines-only strategy, we’re not very good at vaccination,” said William Hanage, associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and co-director of the Center on Communicable Disease Dynamics. “There are large parts of the country which are not vaccinated to higher levels … and that’s made worse by the fact that with Omicron, to get really good protection, you also need to be boosted.” Problems with access to vaccines linger, too. Better-off people have had plenty of opportunities to be vaccinated, but those in poorer households still struggle to get vaccines – and time off to recover from any side effects. Some 15% to 20% of unvaccinated Americans say they are still interested in getting their shots, Hanage said – they simply haven’t been able to yet. Meanwhile, poorer unvaccinated people also face a “double whammy” because they are also more likely to contract Covid, he said. “You have people who are more likely to be exposed to the virus, who are less likely to receive vaccines, who are less likely to be able to take steps to protect themselves even with vaccination, because they’re scared of missing a paycheck, they’re scared of taking a day off, their employer won’t let them.” The US is the most economically unequal of G7 countries, and it offers no guaranteed sick leave. “The absence of paid sick leave is an absolute scandal,” Hanage said. “If you care about working people, give them sick leave. That sick leave will enable them to avoid infecting others, it will enable them to help protect workplaces – it’s just a no-brainer.” Another reason for the disparate outcomes in the US is the fractured healthcare system. People who lack health insurance tend to wait longer to be seen by physicians, making worse outcomes more likely. They are also more likely to have pre-existing health conditions that put them at greater risk for Covid. “There are lots and lots of ways in which societal inequities are mirrored and magnified in our death rates,” Ranney said. “With Covid, there is now no longer any way to cover up all of these underlying problems, and the impact of those problems got magnified because many of the social supports which allowed us to muddle through were no longer present.” The US also has higher rates of death from opioids and gun violence, and lower rates of life expectancy, than similar countries. Hospital overcrowding is also higher in the US than other countries, Ranney said. “Overcrowding correlates with poor outcomes for multiple types of diseases and injuries,” she said. “And there’s been preliminary data that people are more likely to die of Covid when there’s a higher number of Covid patients in the hospital or when ICUs [intensive care units] are overwhelmed.” One predictor of Covid deaths by country is trust in government, according to a recent report in the Lancet: countries with lower levels of trust in government had higher rates of cases and deaths. “If you don’t trust the government, you’re less likely to follow suggestions or mandates around lockdowns, early on, or masks. And then the lack of trust also impairs governments’ ability to do important things like masking or testing or good data acquisition,” Ranney said. Only 25 US states share reliable data on cases by age, which makes it difficult to know how many children are sick, for instance. “And then that hurts our ability to put data-driven public health measures in place, and then people don’t follow the public health measures, because they don’t trust them. And it becomes this circular problem,” Ranney said. National leaders in the US are unable to mandate precautions, like masks or vaccines, for the entire country, with responsibilities largely falling instead to state and local leaders. Yet leaders have seen their ability to act during health emergencies limited even more during the pandemic, with more than half of US states introducing new limits on public health powers. “There is a constituency within the US that is beginning to look at this and see this opportunity,” Hanage said. “A lot of that comes down to: how much illness and death will people accept?” Those who are interested in limiting public health regulations “are looking at this and thinking, whoa, a significant fraction of the population is fine with 900,000 deaths”. There is still time to change course and prevent future losses, Ranney said. “I do think that there’s a chance to create a better future,” she said, noting that leaders can “use this moment to build up the infrastructure that is needed, so if and when there is another variant or some other acute epidemic, we have the system in place to address it”. But the US reaction to the pandemic is also compounded by an American sense of exceptionalism. “It’s a very American idea to suggest that reality is what you want it to be. You can be whoever you want to be. Reality is a real thing, though. The virus doesn’t care who you are,” Hanage said. “It only cares that it can infect you..”",News/US news,Vastly unequal US has world’s highest Covid death toll – it’s no coincidence,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/06/us-covid-death-rate-vaccines
2/6/2022,"“I had a unique touch. Absolutely unique. They came up to me. They came up to me and said they were grateful. Champagne we had that night. The lot.” No, this was not Prime Minister Johnson speaking of the now notorious birthday party that was in breach of his own lockdown rules that we in the rest of the country were observing. This is Stanley, the character whose birthday it is in Harold Pinter’s macabre comedy The Birthday Party.  During his subsequent party, Stanley has a rough time. In my view, Johnson should have been having a rough time for a series of episodes that have been well covered in the media, even if, like Stanley, the prime minister affected to be surprised by his own birthday party. Let them eat cake … Let’s face it: what the Conservative party is now tying itself in knots over is how to handle the realisation that the leader they did not trust, but who gave them a resounding election victory, has been found out as an amoral scoundrel by a largely law-abiding electorate – to say nothing of the rest of the world, in whose eyes he is a laughing stock. Our so-called leader has besmirched the reputation of this once widely admired nation. I know I am far from alone in finding the daily spectacle of this grotesque government’s antics sickening – yes, sickening. Winning that last election was not quite the Johnsonian triumph it was held out to be. Frankly – and I know this will offend many Labour voters, who saw lots in the Corbyn programme that they liked – it was to a very considerable extent an anti-Corbyn election. Indeed, one of the great ironies of recent politics is that the victorious, low-tax Johnsonian Tories have been racking up public spending, not least on account of Covid, to levels only dreamed of by Corbyn. But such spending nowhere near deals with the fundamental economic problems facing society. Not to put too fine a point on it, the leader who “got Brexit done” has, in that very act, been hoist with his own petard. This was illustrated last week in those two major announcements: first about the so-called “levelling up” agenda by Michael Gove; and, secondly, by the chancellor, with his package to alleviate energy costs. There was a slight problem with the levelling-up programme. It is called money. There are no new funds, just a relabelling of previous announcements – announcements whose contents nowhere near made up for a decade of austerity. The hit to this economy from, wait for it, “getting Brexit done” is enormous. The Office for Budget Responsibility’s estimate of a 4% annual reduction to our national income and output from Brexit has not, to my knowledge, been seriously questioned. That figure is a macro number that is the sum of the myriad hits to our productivity – the monumental rise in wasteful extra bureaucratic documentation; the Brexiters’ failure to “regain control”; the lorry queues on the Dover road. Recent studies indicate that manufacturing output has been badly hit by the barriers created by the self-harm of Brexit – barriers which are especially harmful to the small and medium-sized businesses the Tories affect to favour. But then, this is no longer the Conservative party: it is the English National party. After years of relative economic decline vis-a-vis our European neighbours, we entered what was then the European Economic Community in 1973 for good economic reasons. Our average growth rate increased. With Brexit, this benighted country has in effect voted to go back to the path of relative economic decline. For instance: why is Sunak so desperate that he has to go ahead with imposing a national insurance levy on already struggling households? Why is he so severely inhibited in the degree of relief he can offer to a nation hit by such a dramatic surge in gas prices? Why is Gove’s budget for levelling up so pitifully limited? The answer is that the Brexit those charlatans sold to a gullible public has lopped tens of billions of pounds off the Treasury’s potential tax revenues. Now, a past Conservative leader who would put Johnson, and indeed the rest of this cabinet, in the shade was Harold Macmillan. He was fond of quoting the poet Hilaire Belloc: “Always keep a-hold of Nurse/For fear of finding something worse.” I should not compare Johnson to a nurse. But the modern Conservative party is now in the hands of extremists. In the interests of common decency, Johnson has to go. But, alas, he has so soiled the party that there is no guarantee, in terms of policy, that he may not be followed by “something worse”.

2/6/2022,"As usual, he was acting the stunt. Early in the morning on the day of the 2010 election, Nigel Farage turned up at an airfield in Northamptonshire, near to the constituency he was contesting. He was wearing his typical pin-striped suit and a rosette in the plum-and-custard colours of his party. He boarded a two-seater plane, the idea being that it would trail a banner bearing the slogan “VOTE FOR YOUR COUNTRY – VOTE UKIP”. Farage wanted to fly in the passenger seat, even though no one would be able to see him from the ground and the TV companies never broadcast campaign stunts on polling day. You can’t just stick a big banner on the back of a small aircraft. The plane had to take off, gain some height and then make a deep dive in order to use a grappling hook to grab the banner from between two poles. The pilot finally managed to attach the banner at the fifth attempt only for it to become entwined in the tail and rudder. The aircraft was soon plunging towards the earth at 80mph. “Oh fuck!” cried Farage. He closed his eyes just before impact, convinced he was about to die. The plane smashed into a field, nose first and inverted. When Farage opened his eyes, he was upside down, his face was almost touching the ground and his blood was dripping on to the grass. Another few inches and he would have been dead.  It is smart of Michael Crick to place this near-death experience at the beginning of a gripping and vivid biography. What better illustration that random quirks of fate can change the destiny of nations. Our recent history would have been very different had Farage died that day. Without him, it is much less likely that Ukip would have been transformed from an eccentric fringe into an insurgent force that felt so threatening to the Conservative party that David Cameron was panicked into pledging a referendum on British membership of the EU. Absent that referendum, there would have been no Brexit. Labour would not have seen its electoral coalition split and smashed at the 2019 election, moderate Tories would not have been purged from their party and the UK would not have become so bitterly divided. Absent Brexit, the premierships of Theresa May and Boris Johnson might well never have happened. No cabinet minister, and arguably no prime minister, of recent times has been so consequential as Farage, a feat the more remarkable because he has many times failed to get himself elected as a Westminster MP. Crick is a highly accomplished biographer whose previous subjects include Jeffrey Archer and Alex Ferguson. One of his missions here is to examine what fuelled “the extraordinary story of one of the most important politicians of modern British history”. The answer is that Farage’s personality is essentially driven by his lusts and the greatest of them are his cravings for fame, money and sex. The desire for the spotlight was inherited from his parents. His mother, Barbara, was a vivacious character. In her late 60s and early 70s, she would strip off and pose for fundraising calendars in the style of Calendar Girls. His stockbroker father, the flamboyantly named Guy Justus Oscar Farage, was known as a great storyteller and the best-dressed man on the Stock Exchange. He was also an absentee dad who left the family when Nigel was just five. The trauma of a missing parent is often in the background of politicians who are desperate for adulation. At the age of 10, he arrived at Dulwich College, a public school in an affluent area of south-east London, where he made a name for himself as a yob with a gob. He and many other boys would get to the school by train. One contemporary recalls being “in awe” of the young Farage’s ability to project spittle across two sets of tracks and hit travellers on the opposite platform. On journeys to the school, the Dulwich boys would take over an empty compartment, wait until the train reached a tunnel, throw the lightbulbs out of the window and “have a massive punch-up in the dark”. The Bullingdon Club would have been proud of them. Around the age of 16, he experimented with a more dandyish persona, turning up for school in a look-at-me striped blazer, walking around with an old-fashioned cane and keeping a box of snuff. There were highly academic boys at Dulwich College. Around a third of the sixth form went on to either Cambridge or Oxford. Farage was not among them. After mediocre A-level results, he eschewed university altogether. It is my thought (not the author’s) that this helps to explain his contempt for expertise, a Brexiter trait that is especially pronounced in his case. Richard North, an aide to Farage when he was an MEP, tells Crick that his boss hated policy meetings. “He was totally out of his bloody depth. Intelligent people – he was scared of them. He has an inferiority complex about education and highly qualified people.” While most of his contemporaries took degrees, he became a trader on the London Metal Exchange with the fierce ambition to make “a lot of money”. Another attraction was the many opportunities to indulge in a PFL– a “Proper Fucking Lunch” or “Proper Farage Lunch”. Though his childhood had been blighted by his father’s alcoholism, one of Farage’s conceits is that he can consume prodigious amounts of booze without wrecking himself. Many of the stories in this book, especially the more hilarious or appalling ones, are lubricated with oceans of alcohol. He had a scare when cancer attacked his left testicle and it had to be removed. His consultant warned him that it was very likely that he would have secondary tumours in his stomach and lungs. As it turned out, the cancer had not spread. When the oncologist turned up in Farage’s room to break the good news, he found him smoking, drinking and on the phone placing bets as he watched horse racing on TV. Crick, who has an acute eye for turning points, identifies this brush with mortality as an intensifier of Farage’s urge to go into politics. The United Kingdom Independence party, famously decried by Cameron as a bunch of “fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists”, had a record of abject electoral failure at this point. It was a small pond for a hungry shark. But it proved to be the perfect vehicle for Farage. In the 1990s, Ukip was populated with men wearing Bomber Command ties. As Crick writes: “Farage, the public school-educated City trader from the borders of London and Kent – a man who loved golf, cricket and fishing, and pottering about first world war battlefields – fitted that southern middle-class profile perfectly.” He soon established himself as the party’s most effective speaker and most tireless campaigner. The initial breakthrough was the 1999 elections to the European parliament, which saw Farage and two other kippers become the party’s first ever MEPs. The limelight beckoned. His debut appearance on the BBC’s Question Time came in 2000 and Crick quotes analysis that he has since been on the programme more frequently than anyone else in politics. This was not because the production team were secret Farageistes, but because the party’s other MEPs were hopeless communicators, while he could be guaranteed to spout often outrageous polemic to the delight of sympathisers and the enragement of the many who were learning to loathe him. Being an MEP proffered opportunities to satisfy his other appetites. Just because his speeches depicted the EU as a corrupt racket leeching off ordinary folk didn’t mean he wasn’t going to make the most of the salary and allowances. “I reckon this job in sterling terms is worth over a quarter of a million pounds a year,” he once declared. “That is what you’d need to earn working for Goldman Sachs or someone like that.” He and other members of the Ukip cadre drank and feasted for England. One favourite restaurant in Strasbourg was À la Tête de Lard (literally, the Pig’s Head). The drinking would go on until three in the morning and sometimes Farage never made it to bed. Colleagues who fell out with him later told stories of champagne being glugged in lapdancing clubs. Crick produces a lively chapter about Farage’s hectic sex life. “Anything in a skirt he would be after,” remarks North. “He’d shag anything that let him.” Though Ukip had banned its MEPs from using their staffing allowances to employ relatives, Farage was publicly accused in the parliament chamber of spending taxpayers’ money on salaries for both his second wife (subsequently separated) and a former mistress. This generated embarrassing headlines. So did the jailing of several Ukip MEPs for fraud. Rancorous feuds and expulsions regularly convulsed the party, often triggered by Farage’s intolerance of anyone who might compete for the spotlight. The affable pint-supper of a thousand pub-based photo opportunities ruthlessly purged internal critics and potential rivals. Yet none of this impeded the party’s momentum. Ukip voters either didn’t know or didn’t care that the party was scandal-ridden. It was an instrument, successfully weaponised by Farage’s grievance-stoking rhetoric, to express their discontent with the status quo. Brexit would not have happened without him, but it is wrong to say that it happened only because of him. The result could have been very different had the foolish Cameron not chosen exactly the wrong time to call the referendum and had not the opportunist Johnson decided to be a Leaver because it best served his leadership ambitions. Comprehensively researched, fluently written and brimming with both funny stories and jaw-dropping ones, this is the best biography of Farage that will be written. My one complaint is that Crick is so keen to be fair-minded that he is too crimped about making judgments. Take the issue of Farage and racism. The book explores his fascination with Enoch Powell, the entanglements with figures from the far right and the alliances with extremist parties in the European parliament. It chronicles the many occasions, going all the way back to his school days, when Farage has been accused either of outright racism or legitimising it. One of many examples was the notorious Breaking Point poster at the climax of the referendum campaign that Farage launched just 90 minutes before the murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox by a white supremacist. The book also rehearses Farage’s objections to being called a racist and his claims to be “extremely upset” by the accusation. It is too limp of the author not to come to his own conclusion. “Egotism, arrogance, duplicity, dishonesty, hypocrisy, all are attributes Nigel Farage has in abundance,” writes Crick, but weakens this punch by adding “so do many other successful politicians, not least our prime minister”. He is more nervous than a biographer ought to be about delivering a verdict on what his subject has done to Britain, writing: “Quite how far-reaching Farage’s legacy will be – how damaging or beneficial, or a combination thereof – it’s far too soon to judge.” No, it isn’t. He played an instrumental role in polarising Britain in the most toxic way and urging this country into its worst strategic mistake since the 1930s. And all because he wanted attention.

Media speculation in the days since has focused on social media trolls, Covid isolation, external or internal pressures, each speaking more clearly to their author’s agenda than the unknowable qualities of the beauty queen’s state of mind.  What is clear is that by 30, Kryst had achieved much: as a North Carolina attorney who fought for social justice and criminal justice reform, a long and triple jump competitor, as titleholder of Miss USA in a year that all four pageant winners (Universe, World, Teen) were women of color, and as creator of White Collar Glam and Emmy-nominated TV correspondent. “She embodied grace, intelligence and passion,” said Dress for Success, the organization that empowers low-income women to achieve economic independence. “This is a tragic loss for all.” “This hurts …and I can’t stop thinking about the lovely @chesliekryst,” shared Gayle King. “She was walking sunshine to me.. i knew her …cared about her …and am deeply saddened… how to explain the unexplainable?” Authorities believe Cheslie took her own life. Her final Instagram post was a portrait captioned: “May this day bring you rest and peace.” Her mother, April Simpkins, said in a statement: “Cheslie led both a public and a private life. In her private life, she was dealing with high-functioning depression which she hid from everyone – including me, her closest confidant – until very shortly before her death.” Her father, Rodney Kryst, told the New York Post he thought “it had a lot to do with family dysfunction … she was sad”. But in her time Kryst burned brightly. She was asked during her pageant appearance if she felt the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements had gone too far. She said no. The movements “are about are making sure that we foster safe and inclusive workplaces. As an attorney, that’s exactly what I want to hear and that’s exactly what I want for this country.” In her last response before she was crowned, Kryst said she’d grown up “in a world “where a woman who looks like me – with my kind of skin and my kind of hair – was never considered to be beautiful. I think it is time that that stops today”. Last week, some who knew her were able to assess her impact. “Her death is an incredible tragedy, particularly for the many women and girls of color she inspired,” Keli Goff, the writer and columnist who included the beauty queen in her play The Glorious World of Crowns, Kinks and Curls after Kryst competed with natural hair, a signature she maintained. Kryst and the other Black beauty queens from 2019, had a profound role in redefining global standards of beauty. “My hope is that her death will not be in vain, but will help end the silence, shame and stigma around mental health, particularly in the Black community,” Goff said. According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP), “suicide and mental health issues do not discriminate, and so it is imperative that we take an uncompromisingly anti-racist approach to improve access to culturally informed, evidence-based quality mental health care”. Goff said she hoped Kryst’s death would not be in vain, and called on the media and those on social media who “thrive on negativity without fully realizing the potential real world harm it does …to take this conversation seriously and inspire all of us to work together to become part of the solution instead of the problem”. Stephanie Dunivan, a vice-president at Essence who met Kryst at a cover shoot for the magazine in 2019, said Kryst was “beautifully articulate” and broke the stereotype of how people think of beauty queens. “She was absolutely stunning and gorgeous having a law degree and standing up for civil rights was definitely beyond skin, deep of what the stereotype of how people even think of beauty queens,” Dunivan said. The significance of having three Black beauty queens in what had otherwise been a euro-centric sphere, and for Kryst to wear her hair naturally, was of “huge significance”, said Dunivan. California’s Crown Act (SB 188), which prohibits discrimination based on hair style and hair texture, had only recently passed, the first of a national roll-out of similar measures. “Seeing that upheld in something as mainstream as a beauty pageant was super significant because there was a thought that natural hair was not professional and not glamorous. She was breaking the ceiling on how we categorize our natural hair, a moment where we can be celebrated as our truest selves and being put in a winning position,” she added.Dunivan is cognizant that Kryst’s story is not exceptional in any grand sense – she faced many of the challenges of her gender and race, and some perhaps more acutely given the curse of hers or any public profile. “My challenge of the status quo certainly caught the attention of the trolls,” Kryst mentioned in an essay published by Allure magazine. In the piece, she reflected on the challenges of growing older and challenging thinking about women’s appearances and opinions. “A grinning, crinkly-eyed glance at my achievements thus far makes me giddy about laying the groundwork for more, but turning 30 feels like a cold reminder that I’m running out of time to matter in society’s eyes – and it’s infuriating,” she wrote. “After a year like 2020, you would think we’d learned that growing old is a treasure and maturity is a gift not everyone gets to enjoy.” Dunivan said additional pressure is placed on women of color in terms of performance professionally and in terms of beauty and presentation. “There’s this trope that we feel like we have to live up to is this strong Black woman archetype. But it leaves us being seen by the world as someone that doesn’t need to be protected, that does not need support. It often leaves us in a place where we don’t feel like we have room to break down or be weak. And I think that is actually to the detriment of our mental well-being.” The other aspect, she says, is that women of color often feel that they have to perform better than others just to be seen as adequate. “It’s an astronomical amount of pressure from both of those ends – and being the first generation to get a seat at the table and often being the only one. The pressure is not just representing yourself, being as excellent and competing with yourself, you’re also representing your whole community,” she said. Still, with so little known, it may be better to return to Kryst’s accomplishments. After she won her pageant title, she remarked to CNN: “People didn’t think, ‘Oh, that’s enough [Black winners]. It’s still possible for us to be successful on your own merit. And it doesn’t matter if you look like the last winner, [if] you look like the last three. If you’re the best, you’re the best, and you can win.”",News/US news,‘A tragic loss for all’: who was former Miss USA Cheslie Kryst?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/06/who-was-cheslie-kryst-miss-usa
2/6/2022,"In 2016, the Senegalese photographer Omar Victor Diop began what he calls the “liberty project”, dramatising in his studio defining moments of black history. This picture, dedicated to the memory of Trayvon Martin, is the most recent of the events that he portrays. As in all of his pictures, Diop casts himself as the teenager, just as he depicts himself in the shoes of Senegalese second world war soldiers, Black Panther members or freedom marchers at Selma, exploring a common thread within struggles for racial justice separated in time and space. It is 10 years ago this month that Martin was shot and killed by neighbourhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. Martin, 17, was on his way home to his father’s house in Sanford, Florida, from a local store where he had bought iced tea and a bag of Skittles sweets. It took six weeks before Zimmerman was arrested and charged with the killing after a petition that attracted more than 2m signatures; when Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder the verdict sparked the Black Lives Matter movement.  Diop pictures himself as Martin in the hooded sweatshirt that became a symbol of solidarity in that protest – Zimmerman had claimed that the hoodie suggested Martin was “a suspicious guy”. He is surrounded by a sunburst halo of Skittles, sanctifying his image. The picture is included in a recent collection of Diop’s photographs from the past decade. “These people who have been subjected to systemic violence, look at the viewer through the lens and seem to say: no liberty without justice,’’ he says. “My intention in depicting this universal chronology of black protest was to act as a reminder, not as a prompt for any particular claims or complaints, but as a means of uniting.” Omar Victor Diop is published by 5 Continents Editions",News/From the Observer,The big picture: a Technicolor tribute to Trayvon Martin,https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2022/feb/06/the-big-picture-a-technicolor-tribute-to-trayvon-martin
2/6/2022,"Guy Leschziner is a consultant neurologist at Guy’s and St Thomas’ hospitals. His areas of expertise are epilepsy and sleep disorders. He has presented two BBC radio series, one on sleep and another on the neurology of our sensory world. His latest book is The Man Who Tasted Words, which explores the relationship between our sensory perception and the reality it constructs. A common phrase in cognitive neuroscience is “perception is nothing more than controlled hallucination”. What exactly does that mean?What we think of as a hallucination is an experience that is devoid of reality or removed from reality. And the term “controlled hallucination” implies that our experiences are constructed by the brain. As I point out in the book, sometimes what we perceive to be reality is very different from the cold, hard reality or what we assumed to be the cold, hard reality around us. So it is essentially stressing the point that what we term reality is entirely a construct of our nervous system.  There is a debate in neuroscience between the orthodox viewpoint that sees our sensory system as a kind of flawed means of perceiving reality and those who suggest it is designed to conceal reality. What are your thoughts on those debates?Intuitively as a human being, rather than as a neurologist, I find it very difficult to get my head around those views that say that our brains are designed to conceal reality. I’m fascinated by these theories. Do I, in my heart of hearts, like to accept them? No, I don’t. I’m much more comfortable with the view that there is some relationship between the world that we inhabit and what we experience rather than them being completely removed from each other. The title of your book refers to a man with synaesthesia, in which one sense triggers another. He can taste words, while someone else sees colours in music. What does this tell us about our sensory system?The most widely cited statistic regarding the prevalence of synaesthesia is that it affects about 4-5% of individuals. The thing that it really tells us is that there are people out there with essentially normal brains – these are not individuals with pathology, they’re not people with brain injury or damage – who experience reality in a very different way from most of us. It highlights that our perception of reality is so defined by how our brains work and illustrates that it’s entirely dependent upon our nervous system. One of your areas of expertise is sleep. The neuroscientist David Eagleman argues that the brain is a Darwinian battlefield between neurons and that dreaming is a means of maintaining vision when we sleep. What do you think about that?It’s true that humans have evolved to be more dependent upon their vision rather than the other senses. But there are lots of theories as to why we dream. The one that particularly appeals to me is that in order for our nervous system to function properly, for us to understand the world, we constantly need to make predictions. In order to make predictions, we need to have some sort of internal model of the world as we understand it. And dreaming may represent an integration of our experiences over the course of the day and, indeed, over the course of our lifetimes into that model. And that dreaming sleep is that stage in our lives every night where we tweak that internal model of the brain. The issue of pain features prominently in your book. One of your subjects experiences no pain at all. Why do you think pain is quite so painful?We know that pain has got many components to it. A major component is the sensory discretion that tells you where in the body that pain is. Another feature that everyone will be aware of is what is termed the affective component of pain. In addition to knowing that I’ve just hit my finger with a hammer, it’s that sort of overwhelming unpleasantness, that dread of pain. I think that that’s a very important evolutionary mechanism. Pain is a very strong driver to avoid damage to oneself. You touch on Covid-19, particularly in relation to loss of smell. Do you expect the research into long Covid will produce neurological findings?Undoubtedly, it is the case that we do see a lot of people in whom long Covid has had a significant psychological impact. For many people, it’s the first time they have been faced with their own mortality. But it’s clear that there appears also to be a physical or biological component to it. From a neurological perspective, one recent study has looked at individuals with the brain fog of long Covid. What they clearly demonstrated in this cohort of individuals is that 70% of them have abnormalities in their cerebrospinal fluid. I think that what we will find out is that there is a combination of factors that leads to long Covid. And to group it into one condition is probably erroneous. If you had a spare billion pounds to spend on medical research, where – from a neurological perspective – would you like it to go?From an entirely selfish perspective, my academic background is in epilepsy and sleep. Sleep was the subject of my first book. And I think that given that we spend a third of our lives asleep and yet we don’t fully understand the impact of what sleep does, I think that that is an area that remains very much underresearched and probably has very far-reaching implications for us all. In a sense, you ask the reader to re-evaluate the senses, particularly the overlooked senses of taste and smell. How would you rank the senses in order of importance to you?I would have said vision first, then hearing, then touch, then smell and then taste. By the end of writing the book, I’m not sure it changed significantly, but I certainly appreciated smell a lot more. It has far-reaching implications in terms of memory, in terms of emotion, in terms of lots of hidden aspects of our lives, for example, the attraction towards another individual. I think it’s much underappreciated that smell is a very important mode of communication. In the time that you’ve been practising, what is the medical breakthrough that has had the greatest impact on your patients?When I was a medical student, it was said that neurology was the speciality with 1,001 diagnoses, but only one treatment. And that treatment was steroids. Whereas our understanding of immunology, in particular, has caused an explosion in terms of treatments that are available for some very serious conditions such as multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune conditions that cause devastating neurological damage. That is a huge step forward therapeutically.  The Man Who Tasted Words by Guy Leschziner is published by Simon & Schuster (£16.99).

2/6/2022,"The Royal Opera House recently emailed some well-intentioned content advice to people who’d bought tickets for its production of Handel’s oratorio, Theodora, first performed in 1750. The new staging, “by the ever-radical Katie Mitchell”, would feature, it said, “explicit presentation of scenes of sexual violence, harassment and exploitation and [the] evocation of themes of terrorism”. This thrilling information was sent to hardened opera fans probably accustomed to watching, for instance, young women being stabbed to death in sacks, or abducted, betrayed or left behind in the underworld, or, taking the initiative, killing an unwanted bridegroom in a sea of blood. Maybe it was inevitable that when Theodora opened last week some studiously unruffled spectators couldn’t help comparing the actual proceedings with its advertised potential to traumatise. “This isn’t the shocking staging we were promised,” was the headline of one review.  As writers of trigger warnings will know, there is a definite art to it, starting with the seemingly arbitrary business, as above, of what to warn about. Then, since triggers within a single text might range from, say, “blood” to “classism” by way of “sexual assault”, “hateful language” and “death or dying”, the professional warner must decide how many warnings is too many. In the case of Romeo and Juliet, the Globe theatre was willing to overlook the statutory rape but mentioned “references to drug use”, along with stage blood, gun shots and suicide. Supposing it’s a good idea, as academics at Royal Holloway have reportedly decided, to warn MA students that Oliver Twist is replete with child abuse, domestic violence and racism, was it right to leave out the casual cruelty to animals, not only to Bill Sikes’s miserable dog, Bull’s-eye? “Mr Gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey, generally, but more particularly on his eyes; and, running after him, bestowed a blow on his head, which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a donkey’s.” Challenged on the Twist warning, Royal Holloway told the Mail on Sunday that the use of content warnings is “standard and accepted practice within academia”, part of its “responsibility to support the mental health and wellbeing of our students” and exists “to educate and inform students in advance around potentially sensitive topics which could cause them anxiety or distress, perhaps as a consequence of past experience”. Or to put it another way, its Twist warning was no more absurd than those others that UK universities have recently applied to work including Jane Eyre, Nineteen Eighty-Four and a children’s book BA module featuring JK Rowling’s Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone. In which, as many 10-year-olds are aware, the child hero starts at wizard school. Older students are advised to tell tutors “if anything is particularly difficult because of its personal relevance”. The presumption that students should be protected from literature-induced discomfiture has been criticised and ridiculed, to strikingly little effect, since trigger warnings began to proliferate in the US, around 2015. The wider application of a term previously used therapeutically in connection with trauma survivors was defended by academics such as the philosophy professor Kate Manne, writing in the New York Times: “It is to allow those who are sensitive to these subjects to prepare themselves for reading about them and better manage their reactions.” That such students might routinely view content ranging from Netflix’s blood, gun and drug-reference-rich offerings to news reports about real child murder, catastrophe and genocide is no reason, to such teachers, to downplay the discomfort brought on by a made-up story about a 19th-century governess. From a teacher’s point of view, perhaps such warning-heightened engagement is easier to deal with than the kind of response that Bernardine Evaristo – and many others – have had to Virginia Woolf: “I didn’t connect with her at all.” That Jacob Rees-Mogg reflexively denounces trigger warnings – “universities should just grow up a bit” – is a further reminder that excessive feeling is generally preferable to none. Plus, sometimes you can see the point. Many students must be stunned, even as they expect it, by the racism with which much of the western literary canon is infected. It’s still a shock, going back to Oliver Twist, to see Dickens interspersing passages of deep fellow feeling with those in which Fagin is repeatedly “the Jew”. Nor is this generation the first to recoil. A Jewish mother wrote to Dickens in 1863, inviting him to “atone for a great wrong”. More recently, it’s regrettable to some of us that the traumatising potential of some fiction never stopped Lord of the Flies and Of Mice and Men being considered ideal introductions, for 12-year-olds, to man’s inhumanity to man. Samuel Whiskers, too, might benefit from a content warning, not for triggering infant panic attacks, but for gifting them a lifetime’s flashbacks to a scuttling rat and a kitten shrouded in dough. In fact, the commonest objection to trigger warnings, that they will cultivate generations of fragile, censorious victims, could be less effective in reversing them than growing evidence that, regardless of the benefits claimed, they are pointless. When theatres and universities defend them as standard practice they don’t merely lack proof of efficacy, or any coherent system of application, they ignore academic findings that trigger warnings have no effect on anxiety and do not alleviate negative emotional reactions. Warnings may even, in the case of trauma survivors, make things worse. “We found,” one study reports, “substantial evidence that trigger warnings countertherapeutically reinforce survivors’ view of their trauma as central to their identity.” So long as intentionally disturbing literature is understood as a threat to student wellbeing, it looks as if academics need to find some other therapeutic approach. Of course it wouldn’t work for everyone, but after a few minutes with the snuff offerings at MailOnline they might turn to Bill Sikes with relief.

2/6/2022,"There was a moment last Monday in the House of Commons when Keir Starmer was lost for words and then froze for a few seconds on the front bench. Unlike most of his MPs he could not even muster an angry gesticulation in Boris Johnson’s direction. Instead, Starmer sat motionless, staring and blinking at the prime minister across the dispatch box with a look of sheer contempt. What the prime minister had just said about the leader of the opposition – that when he had been director of public prosecutions he “spent most of his time prosecuting journalists and failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile” – was soon shown by fact checkers to be baseless. It was also – in the opinion of most MPs – deeply insensitive and gratuitous.  Even Tory MPs were appalled. “I put my head in my hands,” said Sir Charles Walker, the Conservative member for Broxbourne, who was in the Commons at the time. “It should not have been said.” MPs on all sides of the House viewed the comment as far beyond acceptable boundaries of political knockabout and straight out of the Trump playbook. Within hours, lawyers for Savile’s victims were accusing Johnson of “weaponising their suffering” in an attempt to deflect attention from his own problems, and reported that those they represented were “angry, upset and disgusted” by the prime minister’s comments. This was supposed to be Johnson’s time for contrition. He had come to the Commons to make a statement on an initial report into the “partygate” scandal by the senior civil servant Sue Gray. She had been told to pare back her report by the Metropolitan police – who are now investigating a dozen parties in Downing Street, including several attended by Johnson. Despite this, Gray had been highly critical in her broad summary, saying there had been serious failings of leadership at No 10 that had allowed a string of events to take place and develop at the heart of power, where she suggested an unprofessional drinking culture had taken root. Many Tory MPs watched Johnson’s performance closely on Monday as they agonised over whether to send letters to Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 committee, calling for the PM to go. So did members of their constituency associations. One Tory MP and former minister said he was feeling pressure from all directions. Conservatives in his association were very unhappy with Johnson, but he was also contacted regularly by MPs who were backing him. “They were asking if I would like 20 minutes with the prime minister. I said: ‘Well, I am not against having a meeting with him at all.’ But I told them I had asked to see him several times over the past couple of years to discuss serious policy matters, and had been ignored.” The MP decided to bide his time, watch how the prime minister handled himself in the Commons, and keep in contact with his local party. When members of his association watched Johnson’s performance last Monday they were appalled by the Savile comments. “They emailed me to say they thought he should go. They said they thought there had to be a ballot, that he could not run the country any more.” As a result, the same MP – who has not yet been named as among those wanting a vote of confidence – said he will send a letter to Brady early this week making clear he no longer has confidence in the prime minister. If it had been just a few MPs and a scattering of local Conservative associations that felt the Savile episode was a step too far, then the damage to Johnson might have been containable. But it went much further. Back in Downing Street there was also deep unhappiness. There, everyone had known that Johnson’s reaction to the Sue Gray report could well decide not only the prime minister’s fate, but their futures too. Aides to Johnson were aware that it could be make or break: that he just had to get the tone right. After several meetings, it was agreed between the PM and his key aides on Monday morning that Johnson would adopt an apologetic tone and say sorry several times, even it the mea culpas became repetitive. However, according to accounts from several government sources, Johnson indicated that he was not prepared just to eat humble pie. He had been frustrated for months by the lack of “dirt” his advisers had provided him with to throw at Starmer at moments when he was under pressure, and he told them he was keen to deploy the Savile attack line, which had been drawn to his attention after appearing on rightwing websites. It is understood that Johnson was strongly advised not to do so by at least one aide – but pressed ahead anyway. His decision backfired spectacularly. One of those most outraged by what happened in the Commons was Munira Mirza, Johnson’s head of policy inside Downing Street, who had worked with him since 2008. They had stuck together through thick and thin since he was mayor of London. But Mirza regarded the Savile slur as appallingly ill-judged and tasteless; after Johnson deployed it, she demanded her boss apologise publicly and did so to his face. But on this occasion he did not do as his most trusted aide wanted. While he backtracked a little both on Wednesday at prime minister’s questions and on Thursday in a media interview, his words fell far short of an apology. On Thursday afternoon Mirza penned a blistering resignation letter. “You are aware of the reason for my decision,” she said. “I believe it was wrong for you to imply this week that Keir Starmer was personally responsible for allowing Jimmy Savile to escape justice. There was no fair or reasonable basis for that assertion. This was not the normal cut-and-thrust of politics; it was an inappropriate and partisan reference to a horrendous case of child sex abuse. You tried to clarify your position today but, despite my urging, you did not apologise for the misleading impression you gave.” She went on: “Even now, I hope you find it in yourself to apologise for a grave error of judgment made under huge pressure. I appreciate that our political culture is not forgiving when people say sorry, but regardless, it is the right thing to do. It is not too late for you but, I’m sorry to say, it is too late for me.” That evening three more senior officials – Johnson’s chief of staff Dan Rosenfield, his principal private secretary Martin Reynolds, and director of communications, Jack Doyle, quit their posts, apparently having been told to go by Johnson as he tried to give the impression that the clearout was part of an organised restructuring of Downing Street to refresh his administration. That same evening the crisis for Johnson deepened. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak – the favourite to succeed him if he goes – deliberately distanced himself from the prime minister. Asked about the Savile slur, Sunak told a press conference: “With regard to the comments, being honest I wouldn’t have said it and I am glad the prime minister clarified what he meant.” On Friday night the health secretary Sajid Javid did the same saying Starmer had done a “good job” as DPP and “should be respected for it”. Just when Johnson needed unity most, his own choice of attack line had given his detractors and rivals at all levels a reason to desert him, that was nothing directly to do with parties. The cabinet had split, Downing Street was in turmoil with desks unoccupied, and local Tories were in revolt. But the biggest question this weekend, which only Sir Graham Brady can answer, is how many of the 54 letters he must receive from Conservative MPs before he triggers a vote of confidence have already landed on his desk or in his inbox. As ever, Brady was politely refusing to say yesterday. What is clear is that in the last few days support for Johnson has been ebbing away as the PM’s dwindling band of backers try in vain to lead his fightback. MPs who now want him to go come from all wings of the party. One Nation moderates from the Tory left like Peter Aldous and Gary Streeter have sent in their letters. As one party source said: “These are people who have spent their entire careers never saying boo to a goose. If they are on the warpath there’s a big problem.” From the pro-Brexit right, the likes of Andrew Bridgen and the former schools minister Nick Gibb have also put in letters. Even Johnson “loyalists” like Walker, a former vice chair of the 1922 executive who admires the prime minister, wants him to leave now for the sake of his legacy and because he says the public has made up its mind about the parties and wants to move on from the trauma of lockdowns. “It is in Boris’s hands at the moment,” Walker said, “but if he doesn’t act soon it will be taken out of his hands by the parliamentary party and then he is not in control of anything. It is an inevitable tragedy. He is a student of Greek and Roman tragedy. It is going to end in him going so I just want him to have some agency in that.” While Johnson’s critics say there is no co-ordinated plot to remove him there are plenty of MPs doing the sums. Some say they think the number of letters to Brady is now “in the mid-40s” while others believe it is in “the early 30s”. All agree, however, that the number will grow in the coming days and is edging towards 54. A week ago, the consensus was that nothing would happen until the final police report and Gray report into No 10 parties were out. Now there is a view that things could happen earlier than that. “I would not be entirely surprised if Sir Graham is calling a press conference on Monday or Tuesday, before the recess,” said a former minister who is wrestling with his own conscience about whether to put pen to paper. Johnson is still insisting he can go on and will make big changes to his Downing Street operation. But doing so could prove increasingly difficult as the leadership threat grows. Nick Faith, director of the political and economic consultancy WPI Strategy, who used to work at the centre-right thinktank Policy Exchange, said filling key posts would be a problem for Johnson. “The vast majority of political and communications professionals would currently think twice about working in what appears to be a highly dysfunctional workplace,” he said. Johnson’s suggestion that he was turning for advice once more to election guru Lynton Crosby in some advisory role was another problem. “The suggestion that the prime minister is taking strategic advice from external figures should serve as a warning to anyone thinking about applying for a full-time, senior role in No 10. It undermines their authority before they’ve even entered the building,” Faith added. With several key desks at No 10 unfilled after allies left, the cabinet fracturing, and more MPs moving against the prime minister by the day, there is now a broad consensus that Boris Johnson’s time is running out. “It is like all his layers of defence are being peeled away. And whatever he does makes things worse,” said a former minister. “This feels like the end of days.” If Johnson is forced out of office, it will be an ironic vindication of his woozy ideas. No other modern prime minister has been expelled in similar circumstances, writes Nick Cohen In his biography of Winston Churchill, Boris Johnson makes it clear he has no time for historians who claim that economic, cultural and social tides drive events. He tells the reader to believe instead the “great man” theory of history – to accept that “one man can make all the difference”. If Johnson is forced out of office, it will be an ironic vindication of his woozy ideas. He will have been destroyed by his own lies and hypocrisies. In the fall of the Johnson administration, Boris Johnson would indeed have made all the difference. No modern prime minister has been expelled from Downing Street in similar circumstances. They have resigned when they lost an election or have been forced out by colleagues. Margaret Thatcher alienated so many Tory MPs with her attitude to Europe – and with a poll tax that provoked something close to a popular uprising – that they replaced her. Political calculation mingled with ideological argument as MPs hoped that a new leader could win the next election – as her successor, John Major, did in 1992. The same mixture applied when Theresa May resigned in 2019 after failing to get her soft Brexit through the Commons. Johnson offered the Tory right a policy – a hard break with the EU – and the promise that his charisma would carry them to victory. Tony Blair’s toxic fight with Gordon Brown coupled with the legacy of his decision to take the UK to war with Iraq ended his premiership in 2007. The only resignations vaguely comparable to Johnson’s are those of Harold Wilson in 1976 and David Cameron in 2016. But Wilson, whose physical powers were failing, decided of his own volition that it was time to retire, while Cameron could not live with the enormous blunder of having taken the UK out of the EU by mistake. Johnson is not in failing health. He has not lost a referendum or fought an unpopular war. No issue of national policy is at stake here. If he goes, it will be because the public cannot abide being governed by a phoney who forced them into lockdown while partying behind the doors of Downing Street. Johnson can rest assured that the history books will remember him: not as a great man but as a great charlatan, whose fate was a salutary warning to all who came after him.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson on the brink: the week that led his premiership to unravel,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/06/boris-johnson-on-the-brink-the-week-that-led-his-premiership-to-unravel
2/6/2022,"Tenants in England whose rent includes council tax, or who live in homes in a council tax band above D, are among those who could miss out on the £150 grant announced by the government last week to reduce the sting of sharply rising energy bills. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, announced measures last Thursday after the regulator, Ofgem, lifted the maximum rate suppliers can charge for an average dual-fuel energy tariff by £693 to almost £2,000 a year.  Sunak said every household would get a one-off repayable £200 discount on their bills in October and a rebate on council tax. However, charities and thinktanks have raised concerns that using council tax as a means to reduce the rising cost of energy is inefficient and unfair, particularly for those who do not own their own homes. The Labour and Cooperative MP Dame Meg Hillier described the plan as policymaking “on the hoof”, saying that while using council tax to distribute money looked simple, the reality was a lot more complicated. “The housing situation isn’t as simple as Whitehall thinks it is,” said Hillier, the MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch in east London. “I have a lot of HMOs [houses in multiple occupation] in my constituency. If the landlord pays [the council tax], do they then take it off the tenants’ rent? “They’re using the council tax account as a way of getting money to people, so if you’re not paying council tax directly or don’t have an account, presumably you are not getting any money.” Hillier suggested the government package was not “going to touch the sides” for struggling households. “People will still be having to make hard choices.” They were already shopping around to save money on a pint of milk, she said: “If that is the margin you are working on, £150 off a near £700 rise in energy bills is not going to cut it.” The Resolution Foundation also criticised the plan to distribute money via the council tax system. It said 640,000 households in England in the bottom 30% based on income lived in properties rated E and above. It would also be hard to get the cash to the 25% of households who did not pay their council tax by direct debit, the thinktank suggested. About a quarter, or 4.4 million, of households in England live in private rented accommodation, according to the English Housing Survey. The figure for the UKas a whole is approximately 5 million. The Treasury says that 95% of renters are in band A to D properties. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said energy bills were a big area of uncertainty for private renters and nearly a fifth were already in arrears. “For renters or sharers whose bills are included in their rent, the benefit of the rebate and loans won’t come to them and some landlords may still increase rents to make up any shortfall,” said Darren Baxter, the charity’s housing policy and partnerships manager. Other groups, such as students, who are exempt from paying council tax, have also complained about being ignored. Hillary Gyebi-Ababio, the NUS vice-president, said Sunak had “ghosted” students. “Students are already under extreme financial pressure,” she said, adding that thousands of them were using food banks. The government is giving local authorities £150m to make discretionary payments to poorer families, such as those who live in properties that do not qualify for the council tax rebate. It is also expanding the number of households who can apply for the warm homes discount, which is worth £150 from October. It plans to consult on how to treat renters who do not pay council tax directly.",Lifestyle/Money,Thousands of tenants in England could miss out on council tax cut,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/06/thousands-of-tenants-in-england-could-miss-out-on-council-tax-cut
2/6/2022,"France’s presidential election is still two months away and the most likely winner, according to opinion polls, the incumbent, Emmanuel Macron, has yet to declare his candidacy. Yet one result already appears certain: the vote will be another, perhaps terminal, disaster for the once-dominant Socialist party and, more broadly, the French left. Important lessons may be drawn from this impending failure by other European progressive, social democratic parties and also by Labour in Britain. The re-election victory in Portugal last week of António Costa’s Socialists, who improved on their 2019 performance, demonstrated it is still possible for the centre-left to win, govern and win again.  One basic lesson concerns the willingness to rally loyally round a single standard-bearer, eschewing the factionalism so typical of the left in Europe (and the US). In France, voters are confronted by no fewer than seven leftwing Élysée hopefuls, including the Socialist, Anne Hidalgo, the Greens leader, Yannick Jadot, the hard-leftist Jean-Luc Mélenchon and the Communist, Fabien Roussel. Fears of an approaching train wreck intensified after an attempt to agree a “unity candidate” backfired spectacularly. A former minister, Christiane Taubira, won an informal vote, which was boycotted by the main contenders, rendering it meaningless. Of the magnificent seven, only Mélenchon is in double figures in the polls (10%). Hidalgo, heir to the former Socialist president François Hollande, who only left office in 2017, is on a risible 3%. Another key lesson for the left is the need to adapt to changing political formations. In Germany, the Social Democrats ended decades of centre-right rule last year by forming an unlikely coalition with the Greens and the neoliberal Free Democrats. In Norway, the Labour party regained power in September by allying with the agrarian Centre party. In order to win, the left (loosely defined) must also adapt to changing electorates. It is far from clear, in many countries, that a homogenous working-class vote still exists. The end of the communist era, the impact on communities and jobs of deindustrialisation, globalisation and post-2008 austerity, and fears stoked by far-right populists about immigration and identity have altered voting habits. France has its own equivalents of England’s red wall seats – decaying urban areas where well-paid manufacturing jobs have vanished and investment dried up. But instead of switching to a Tory-like party, voters there increasingly back Marine Le Pen or Éric Zemmour, the siren voices of far-right reaction and division. This is what can happen when the left fails in its responsibility to offer plausible, winning alternatives. Spain provides perhaps the best European example of how socialism in the 21st century can thrive. Pedro Sánchez’s Socialist Workers party took office in 2018, in coalition with the populist Podemos and other factions. From the start, Sánchez rejected austerity and prioritised fighting poverty and inequality. It hasn’t all gone swimmingly, by any means. But Sánchez’s supporters say that by increasing public funding for healthcare and education, boosting the minimum wage by 29%, helping small businesses and insisting that all government policies take account of environmental and climate crisis goals, he has succeeded in reconnecting with disaffected voters – the old “working class” – and in creating a progressive majority for change. It seems to be working. Recent polling by the newspaper El País suggests the Socialists would triumph afresh if an election were held today, albeit with some losses to the right and far-right. Spain offers no panaceas for the sickness of the left. But it does point to a way forward for those in Britain, France and elsewhere who wonder whether they will ever win again.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on the forthcoming French elections  | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/06/observer-view-on-forthcoming-french-elections
2/6/2022,"From buying exactly the same groceries every week to using the same beauty products forever, we are all guilty of sticking to what we know. I see the sense in this, but it doesn’t always serve us well. It can mean missing out on discovering something new and better – like great new products from niche brands. These are not household names but worth paying attention to as they deliver. Take masks, which are so relevant now seeing as winter is one of skin’s biggest enemies: while nothing beats an incredible facial, masks are financially less painful and if you are consistent with their use – the key to all good skincare routines – your skin will thank you for it. Hydrating masks from the likes of Verso are a no-brainer right now. Youth To the People’s clever combo of science and botanicals is the ultimate exfoliating, yet moisturising boost. Votary’s is similar, its key ingredients – lactic and mandelic acid – are great for shedding dead skin cells, but the formula is impressively gentle and hydrating. As is Farmacy’s. To refine skin texture without stripping the skin, Ameliorate’s is gamechanging. For decongesting, Olivanna, Zitsticka, Strivectin and Wildsmith are brilliant because unlike most clay based masks, they draw out impurities without upsetting your skin barrier. And if you are in the market for a brightening, anti-puff, under-eye treatment that is a little more sophisticated than cucumber slices or old teabags, Equilibrium has you covered. 1.

2/6/2022,"A top official from Sweden’s new “psychological defence” agency said the country had decided to bring back the cold war-era government body amid fears over Russian aggression against Ukraine. Magnus Hjort, deputy director of the agency, which was re-established last month to combat foreign disinformation, said concerns were especially heightened ahead of Sweden’s general election in September, against the backdrop of Europe’s “deteriorating security situation”.  Tensions are mounting in the region following Russia’s troop build-up near Ukraine’s border, prompting discussion over whether Sweden and Finland, which are not members of Nato, should join the military alliance. Last month Sweden strengthened its military presence on the strategically important island of Gotland, in the Baltic Sea. While Hjort said there was no immediate threat to Sweden, he warned: “We can’t rule out that Sweden can be attacked.” The previous iteration of the agency was closed down in 2008, but much of it was dismantled years earlier after the end of the cold war. While the new agency has been in the making since 2016, Hjort said the latest Russia/Ukraine crisis has put Sweden on alert ahead of its elections. “It could mean that security and defence will be more important in the election, and that could mean it could be more interesting for a foreign power to influence the way people are voting – to make sure that Sweden takes the ‘right measures’ in the way a foreign power sees it,” he said. “So there could be a bigger interest in affecting the general election. It’s possible because of the security situation in Europe right now.” The mission of the Swedish psychological defence agency, which has around 45 staff and is expected to grow, is to “safeguard our open and democratic society, the free formation of opinion, and Sweden’s freedom and independence.” Citing the 2016 US election and attempts to interfere with the 2017 election in France – which last year set up a similar agency to combat foreign disinformation and fake news – as examples, Hjort said: “Authoritarian states have for years been trying to influence elections. The difference today is that through social media you have better opportunities to influence people. That’s why we need to have the capacity to monitor for an interference in our democracy.” The 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea prompted Sweden to start rebuilding its “total defence”, combining military, civilian and psychological security, he said. “What we have seen lately is that the security situation has deteriorated in our part of the world. It has become more tense.” Worsening relations in Europe have shown how disinformation and interference are a “vital part of the toolbox that authoritarian states use to achieve their objectives,” he said. He added: “We have to have something to analyse, to identify this and to be able to counter it and that’s why we are now establishing a psychological defence agency in Sweden.” While the election will be one of its most important tasks this year, the agency is intended to show a long-term commitment to “strengthening the resilience within the population”, including across government agencies and municipalities to identify interference by foreign states in freedom of opinion and expression. “Conflict between states will be there after this year as well,” he said. But he added: “This year could become particularly nasty and difficult.” Social media, Hjort said, has dramatically changed the nature of psychological defence, making Sweden “more vulnerable”. While he said the social media companies could “always do more” to protect from foreign intervention, psychological defence also lies in individual citizens being aware that they could be exposed to influence from foreign powers. Mats Engström, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said other Swedish agencies were already working in the field, but the creation of the psychological defence agency was “a further step in light of increased threats”. He said that Russian propaganda has been referring to Sweden negatively in recent years, including on issues such as immigration, but that fears of influence affecting the 2018 election did not appear to materialise. There were, he said, fears about how the new agency could impact free speech. “It will have to tread very carefully on controversial issues not to create the impression of the state trying to stifle critical views. Even if it is stated in the instructions that the new agency shall promote free speech, the line is not easy to draw.”",News/World news,Sweden returns to cold war tactics to battle fake news,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/06/sweden-returns-to-cold-war-tactics-to-battle-fake-news
