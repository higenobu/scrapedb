5/20/2022,"(Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Thursday said Russian forces had ""completely destroyed"" the industrial Donbas region and accused Moscow of carrying out senseless bombardments as it intensified its offensive. Zelenskiy also accused Russian forces of attempting to kill as many Ukrainians and do as much damage as possible, repeating his charge that Russia was carrying out a genocide. Zelenskiy said that while Ukrainian forces were continuing to liberate the Kharkiv region to the east of Kyiv, Russia was trying to exert even more pressure in the Donbas, which lies in the southeastern part of Ukraine. ""It is hell there - and that is not an exaggeration,"" he said in a late night video address, adding that 12 people had been killed in the ""brutal and absolutely senseless bombardment"" of Severodonetsk on Thursday. ""(There are) constant strikes on the Odesa region, on the cities of central Ukraine. The Donbas is completely destroyed,"" he said. ""This is a deliberate and criminal attempt to kill as many Ukrainians as possible, to destroy as many houses, social facilities and enterprises as possible."" STORY: A Russian soldier asked a Ukrainian widow to forgive him for murdering her husband, as a Kyiv court heard the first war crimes trial arising from the Russian invasion.At the second hearing on Thursday (May 19), Kateryna Shelipova, asked 21-year-old tank commander Vadim Shishimarin if he repented. ‚ÄúYes. I admit guilt. I understand that you will not be able to forgive me. I ask for forgiveness.‚ÄùShishimarin had pleaded guilty a day before to killing the unarmed 62-year-old civilian. Oleksandr Shelipov died in the northeast Ukrainian village of Chupakhivka, a few days after Russia's invasion on February 24th.The widow told the court she heard shots fired from their yard and called out to her husband, who was wearing civilian clothes. He was already dead, she said. ""I screamed so much.""The Kremlin has said it has no information about the trial and that the absence of a diplomatic mission in Ukraine limits its ability to provide legal assistance. Elsewhere during the months of conflict, Ukraine has accused Russia of atrocities and brutality against civilians and has identified what it says are more than 10,000 possible war crimes. The International Criminal Court is leading a team of prosecutors investigating war crimes allegations in the country. Russia has denied targeting civilians or involvement in such crimes.Shishimarin is accused of firing several shots with an assault rifle at Shelipov's head from a car after being ordered to do so. Asked if he had been obliged to follow that order, he said ""no."" He could face up to life imprisonment if convicted.Ukraine is currently gripped by the fate of hundreds of its own soldiers who gave themselves up to Russia.Kyiv hopes Moscow will hand them over as part of a prisoner swap. But some Russian voices are calling for them to now be put on trial.

5/20/2022,"A Ukrainian medic smuggled footage of Mariupol's horrors to AP reporters before they left the city. Yuliia Paievska's footage showed her tending to wounded Ukrainians ‚Äî and even Russians. A day after she snuck out the video, Russian forces abducted her. Her whereabouts are unknown. A Ukrainian medic was captured by Russian forces in mid-March after sneaking out video evidence of the war's devastation. Yuliia Paievska ‚Äî known in Ukraine as Taira ‚Äî recorded 256 gigabytes of harrowing and graphic footage from a helmet camera in Mariupol over a two-week period during Russia's siege on the city, the Associated Press reported on Thursday. Taira, 53, handed off the camera card to an AP team. The team of journalists ‚Äî one of whom hid the evidence in a tampon ‚Äî made their way through over a dozen Russian checkpoints before they escaped the strategic southern port city in a humanitarian convoy, the report said. Taira was captured by Russian troops the next day, the report continued. Russian broadcasters aired a video of her and accused her of trying to flee the city in disguise. She hasn't been seen since. The footage, published in Thursday's report, documents the efforts of Taira's team to save the lives of wounded Ukrainians ‚Äî and even Russians. In one video, a team of medics could be seen trying to save a young boy's life. He didn't survive, and Taira turned away ‚Äî placing a bloodied hand on a wall. The helmet footage picked up sounds of her sobbing, as medical devices beeped in the background. She then shut the boy's eyes. Another video published by the AP showed Taira removing bloodied gloves from her hands, before moving to footage of her hustling down a hallway behind first responders as they pushed a stretcher. The following frame showed Taira tending to the wounded and bloodied face of a man ‚Äî opening his eyelid with extreme caution as he took deep breaths. More footage from Taira's helmet camera showed a soldier being carried away on a stretcher, before cutting to a shot of a soldier's bloodied face getting bandaged by medics. In the next frame, medics performed CPR on an unidentified person. Since her abduction, a website was published showing how long Taira has been in Russian captivity since March 16 ‚Äî 65 days and counting. Efforts between Ukraine and Russia to involve her in a prisoner swap have stalled. Her husband, Vadim Puzanov, told the AP that he had little to no knowledge of her whereabouts or condition. The website said Russian state media had tried to use Taira in disinformation and propaganda campaigns. ""Accusing a volunteer medic of all mortal sins, including organ trafficking, is already outrageous propaganda ‚Äî I don't even know who it's for,"" Puzanov said. Medics, hospitals, and other healthcare facilities have consistently been targeted by Russian forces throughout the three-month war. Editor's Note: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated how the camera footage was smuggled out of Mariupol, Ukraine. The camera card was handed off by the medic to a team of AP journalists, one of whom hid it in a tampon.

5/20/2022,"On Thursday, the three leaders of Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation addressed the controversy that has surrounded the organization over the last month. When it was revealed in April by New York Magazine that BLM founder Patrisse Cullors secretly purchased a $5.8 million mansion in Southern California, outraged quickly ensued. In an effort of transparency, the 990s were posted on the Black Lives Matter foundation website.
 Cicley Gay, D‚ÄôZhane Parker and Shalomyah Bowers held a media roundtable discussion to address the organizational finances. Bowers, whose consulting firm received $2 million, according to the tax documents, explained how that‚Äôs typical in businesses: ‚ÄúLess than 10% [of the $79 million raised] were dedicated to overhead and operational expenses, which is in stark contracts to the 30% in overhead costs from organizations that get A ratings from nonprofit watchdog organizations like GuideStar.‚Äù Read more &#39;You Got McDonald&#39;s Money?&#39; and Other Phrases We Remember From Childhood &lt;i&gt;Black in the Day&lt;/i&gt;: Barrettes, Blue Magic and Other Ways We Laid Our Hair Cheat Sheet: What is Critical Race Theory? Toasted: Jerk Chicken Empanadas and Mango Chili Sauce He went onto explain more of how BLM funds have been distributed. ‚ÄúOver $25 million has been reinvested into the Black community; that broken down represents over $10 million in grants to Black led frontline organizations, truly doing the work of abolition on the ground. Over $13 million in grants [has gone] to Black Lives Matter chapters. Nearly $3 million have gone out in grants to impacted family foundations. $3 million has gone out directly for relief to Black people who were struggling during COVID when the administration was providing stimulus checks.‚Äù The house purchased by Cullors was also addressed, though Gay clarified that her and Parker joined BLM after it was purchased. Bowers explained how the mansion serves as a house for the ‚ÄúBlack Joy Creators Fellowship.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe creator‚Äôs house was purchased as a space of our own with the intention of providing housing and studio space for recipients of the Black Joy Creators Fellowship in service to Black culture. The intention is that Black creatives will have an opportunity to launch online content,‚Äù Gay added. When asked if the house was currently occupied by anyone, the board members confirmed that it wasn‚Äôt. As far as Cullors‚Äô connection to Black Lives Matter goes: ‚ÄúPatrice is always honored as a movement founder and one of the co-founders of the Black Lives Matter movement and hashtag, she stepped down last year. She has no legal connection to the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation. We as the three board members are leading the foundation,‚Äù Gay explained. The filings also revealed that nearly $1 million that media production to Trap Heals LLC, a company founded by Damon Turner who has a child with Cullors. Nearly $840,000 went to Cullors‚Äô brother Paul for security, something BLM will continue to pay for. ‚ÄúHe still does currently serve as the organization‚Äôs head of security. The concept of having people you know and trust and have done work with in the past as employees or vendors and consultants within an organization or just on your team is not new,‚Äù Bowers shared. Cullors isn‚Äôt officially attached to BLM anymore, though Parker saying they‚Äôre using her legacy with the organization as a turning point. ‚ÄúWe are continuing to look over all of those...those learned lessons and figuring out how we could do it better in the future. We are planning to handle things differently moving forward.‚Äù",Business/The Root,Black Lives Matter Tries To Explain The Millions And That Mansion,https://news.yahoo.com/black-lives-matter-tries-explain-184100128.html
