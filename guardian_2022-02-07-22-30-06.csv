2/7/2022,"Exam boards have published advance information about some of the content due to come up in GCSEs and A-levels this summer, amid warnings that tens of thousands of pupils could lose out on top grades compared with last year’s results. This summer is a transition year when examiners will be asked to be more generous when setting grade boundaries to provide a safety net for students who might otherwise just miss out on a higher grade, but there will be significantly fewer top grades when results are published in August.  On Monday, pupils and teachers were given access to long-awaited details of topics, themes and skills likely to be assessed during the exams, intended to help focus revision in the run-up to the summer series. Advance information has been provided for the majority of GCSE and A-level subjects, including maths, biology, chemistry and languages. It does not provide exact questions that will appear in exams, however, and is one of a range of measures intended to recognise the impact of the pandemic on learning. Analysis by the Liberal Democrats suggests about 90,000 pupils could miss out on top grades in their GCSEs and A-levels because of the government’s planned changes. Summer exams are due to go ahead this year after two years of cancellations owing to the pandemic. The teacher-assessed grades that were used instead led to record results for students. The exams regulator Ofqual has said it wants to rein in grade inflation and get back to normal grading, but over a two-year period. According to Liberal Democrat analysis, planned changes for this summer could mean that almost 25,000 GCSE pupils miss out on grades 7, 8 or 9, and 66,000 A-level students miss out on As or A*s, compared with under the grading system last year. This year’s results are still expected to be higher than 2019. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, said: “Students taking exams this year have had their entire course affected by the pandemic, from the start through to the finish. Lowering grades this year is arbitrary, senseless and heartless when the pandemic is still ongoing. “Our children have worked as hard as they can in incredibly difficult circumstances and their grades should reflect their hard work, instead of being artificially reduced by a thoughtless government.” In addition to the advance information published by exam boards on Monday, the government has introduced adaptations include a choice of topics in some GCSEs such as English literature and history, and support materials such as formulae sheets in maths. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, said: “Exams are the best and fairest form of assessment, and we firmly intend for them to take place this summer, giving students a fair chance to show what they know. “We know students have faced challenges during the pandemic, which is why we’ve put fairness for them at the forefront of our plans. The information to help with their revision published today, as well as the range of other adaptations, will make sure they can do themselves justice in their exams this summer.” Ofqual’s chief regulator, Dr Jo Saxton, said: “Students have shown so much resilience during the pandemic and we know that they are seeking certainty. Advance information published today is one of the ways we are supporting students to have that certainty as they prepare to show what they know and can do. We are also ensuring there is a safety-net for students with a generous approach to grading.” Dr Mary Bousted, a joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “The release of this ‘advance’ information comes too late. There are grave concerns amongst teachers of exam groups that this will not be enough to fairly mitigate the disruption these students have experienced over two academic years.”",News/Education,Guidance on GCSE and A-level exams published amid grade concerns,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/07/guidance-on-gcse-and-a-level-exams-published-amid-grade-concerns
2/7/2022,"Gas is not just a source of energy, sometimes it is a political weapon. As western countries weigh possible sanctions against Russia for an invasion of Ukraine, the future of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline hangs in the balance. But it’s complicated. The EU gets 41% of its gas from Russia; Russia earns 60% of its import revenues from the bloc. The crisis over Ukraine comes as Europe is struggling to deal with soaring gas prices and internal divisions over how to wean itself off fossil fuels in response to the climate emergency.  Nord Stream 2 is a 1,200km pipeline connecting Russia and Germany, with the potential to supply 26m German homes. The pipeline has been completed but has not yet certified by Germany’s energy regulator. It’s much more than another engineering project. The Baltic Sea pipeline bypasses Ukraine and is seen as depriving Kyiv of lucrative transit fees. One former Polish foreign minister even likened it to the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop pact that carved up eastern Europe between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. The US has insisted the pipeline will not move forward if Russia invades Ukraine. Somewhat less emphatically, Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, has said the pipeline would be up for discussion as part of sanctions measures. The EU needs unanimity among 27 member states to impose sanctions. While Germany’s voice would probably be decisive, stopping Nord Stream 2 would need support from other member states, such as Austria and Bulgaria, that are highly dependent on Russian gas and nervous about antagonising Moscow. They are among 10 member states in central and eastern Europe that import more than 75% of their gas from their eastern neighbour. EU officials fear any move against Nord Stream 2 would trigger retaliation from Moscow. That’s impossible to answer without seeing inside the mind of Vladimir Putin, who likes to keep the world guessing. But the Kremlin has shown previously it is ready to use gas as a weapon, during the supply crises of 2006 and 2009, which had a severe impact on central and eastern Europe. Russia is heavily dependent on fossil fuel revenues, but has made efforts to increase supplies to China, a big and powerful customer, over the last 15 years Last week, Moscow agreed a 30-year contract to supply China with gas and build a new pipeline. But the EU remains a lucrative customer, for now. Gazprom already stands accused of market manipulation in Europe in an effort to pressure European regulators to grant a swift approval to Nord Stream 2, which needs to clear regulatory hurdles. The Russian state energy company has dismissed the charges as lies. With the support of the US, EU officials are searching the globe for alternative gas suppliers. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, and energy commissioner Kadri Simson are holding talks on energy security with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in Washington on Monday. The US is the biggest supplier of liquefied natural gas to the EU. Talks are under way on increasing LNG supplies to the EU from Norway, Qatar, Azerbaijan and Algeria. Analysts at the Brussels thinktank Bruegel argue that the EU could get by without Russian gas supplies until the summer with increased imports, a few logistical headaches and some effort to reduce demand. In the longer term, Bruegel writes, the EU would face more painful political choices, including costly action to reduce demand, such as emergency closures of industrial plants. Despite successive gas disputes with Russia and the huge diplomatic fallout over the annexation of Crimea and downing of flight MH17 in 2014, the EU has done little to wean itself off Russian gas. The EU had not done enough to “enhance our capacity to face potential gas supply cuts”, while Russia has been building up its foreign currency reserves, a measure to insulate itself from western sanctions, noted the EU foreign policy chief in a blogpost ahead of his Washington trip. The latest crisis could force a reckoning, as should the EU’s climate policy, which has a legally binding target of net zero emissions by 2050. The problem is many member states see gas as a bridge away from coal or nuclear power. The need for a “gas bridge” is disputed by environmentalists, but the policy choice has already been made in many European capitals. Europe’s thirst for gas, it seems, is not going to disappear anytime soon.

2/7/2022,"As she has laid waste to her rivals throughout an extraordinary first season as a senior while skating with deeper maturity and sophistication in each passing competition, it’s been increasingly apparent that only an act of God could prevent Russian prodigy Kamila Valieva from winning figure skating’s most prestigious title. On Monday, the 15-year-old Valieva offered the world a sneak peek of why next week’s Olympic women’s singles competition is little more than a formality, becoming the first woman to land a quadruple jump at the Olympics – then doing it again moments later – to punctuate the Russian Olympic Committee’s runaway gold in the team event at Capital Indoor Stadium.  Valieva, the newly minted Russian and European champion who has already broken the world records for the women’s short programme, free skate and combined total in a stunning debut campaign as an adult skater, opened her title-clinching long program on Monday with a gigantic quad salchow before following with a quad toe loop in combination with a triple toe loop. Her final score of 178.92 was more than enough to prevail in Monday’s free skate, nailing down a gold that was safely in hand even before Valieva’s first-place finish in the short on Sunday single-handedly wiped out the Americans’ day-one lead. “I had [the] burden of responsibility, but I came out a winner,” Valieva said. “It’s been quite overwhelming. I was very nervous, but I am just glad I was able to execute all of my elements well. To perform with a team like this means everything.” Valieva’s dominance on Monday, which followed her Russian team-mates Anastasia Mishina and Aleksandr Galliamov’s win in the pairs’ free skate, left the United States and Japan in a touch-and-go battle for silver. Ultimately, the Americans were able to lock down second place with 65 points through the ice dance pair of Madison Chock and Evan Bates, whose personal-best score of 129.07 in the free dance helped secure the United States’ best ever finish in the team event. The medal proved sorely needed on a Monday when three of Team USA’s warmest medal contenders finished off the podium entirely: Mikaela Shiffrin in the giant slalom, Red Gerard in the snowboard slopestyle and Brittany Bowe in the speed skating 1500m. Japan finished with 63 points to reach the team podium for the first time, safely ahead of fourth-place Canada (53), after Kaori Sakamoto took second to Valieva in the free skate and Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kiara followed suit in the pairs’ free. On a morning that almost entirely followed to form, the biggest wrinkle came off the ice when it was announced American skater Vincent Zhou tested positive for Covid-19 on the eve of the men’s singles competition, which begins on Tuesday with the short program. A spokesperson for US Figure Skating confirmed Zhou’s positive test on Monday afternoon, adding that he was undergoing additional testing to confirm his status. If the results are negative, Zhou will be allowed to compete. Zhou, the mercurial 2019 world bronze medalist whose free skate on Sunday helped secure the United States’ team silver, is one of the few entrants in the men’s contest with the technical repertoire of quadruple jumps necessary to challenge the likes of Nathan Chen, Yuzuru Hanyu and Shoma Uno for the gold.",Sport/Sport,Kamila Valieva’s historic quadruple jump seals team figure skating gold,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/07/kamila-valieva-historic-quadruple-woman-team-figure-skating-gold-roc-beijing-2022-olympics
2/7/2022,"Israel’s government has announced that it is setting up a state commission of inquiry after a newspaper alleged that police had used powerful Pegasus spyware against a wide range of public figures including politicians from the left and right, businessmen, officials and activists. Pegasus, a mobile phone hacking tool made by Israel’s NSO Group, was used to “phish for intelligence even before any investigation had been opened against the targets, and without judicial warrants”, Calcalist newspaper said in an unsourced report.  Among those allegedly identified as targets were former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s son Avner and other members of his inner circle, including figures who have given evidence against Netanyahu in police investigations into corruption. Commenting on the report on Army Radio, Avner Netanyahu said he was “in shock”. “Apparently it doesn’t matter whether or not I’m involved in politics – it will happen to you too,” he said. Lawyers for Benjamin Netanyahu – who denies wrongdoing – urged that proceedings against him be suspended. Calcalist set off a fierce political storm last month when it alleged that police had conducted warrantless phone intercepts of Israeli citizens, including politicians and activists, using Pegasus spyware. Prime minister Naftali Bennett, who unseated Netanyahu in June, deemed Calcalist’s latest findings “very serious, if true”. “This tool [Pegasus] and similar tools are important tools in the fight against terrorism and severe crime, but they were not intended to be used in phishing campaigns targeting the Israeli public or officials, which is why we need to understand exactly what happened,” he said. His internal security minister, Omer Barlev, said he was setting up a state commission of inquiry. “There won’t be such failings on my watch,” Barlev tweeted, remarks that cast Calcalist’s findings as predating the current government. The police commissioner, Kobi Shabtai, said any “irregularities and failures” should be “dealt with in accordance with the law”. Barlev said an inquiry would restore the public’s trust in the police and regulate the police’s use of spyware. Also named as targets by the paper were the heads of a number of government departments including the ministry of transport, the ministry of finance, and the ministry of justice, as well as West Bank settlers who were allegedly targeted before evacuations of illegal outposts by security forces. Calcalist said other targets included Rami Levy, who runs a chain of popular discount supermarkets, a senior union official at Israel Aerospace Industries, journalists including the former editor-in-chief of the Walla news site, and leaders of protest movements for Ethiopian and disability rights. Commenting on the latest report, the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, said: “This is not an easy day. The law enforcement system can not be careless when it comes to following the law. We must not lose our democracy. We must not lose our police. And certainly – we must not lose the public’s trust in them. This requires a thorough and foundational examination.” The country’s rightwing interior minister, Ayelet Shaked, was equally damning. “If these things are right then we are talking about an earthquake, acts that fit dark regimes from the previous century that we must not be like,” Shaked said. “Mass intrusion into the privacy of many people is lawlessness that must be stopped today. An external commission of inquiry is required … The Knesset and the entire public deserve answers, today.” On Monday morning, police spokesperson Eli Levy told the Kan public broadcaster that he would not be commenting on the latest reports and that the service was open “to a full transparent investigation”. The report suggested that among justifications for the bugging were allegations that officials at ministries were leaking material to journalists, cross-checking evidence in investigations and – in the case of protest organisers – needed to see which road junctions might be blocked. NSO has previously said that all its sales are government-authorised and that it does not itself run Pegasus.

2/7/2022,"Beer lovers are going to have to pay more for their pints because the drink industry faces a “vicious cycle” of surging costs, the founder of Cobra Beer has warned. Lord Bilimoria, who has turned Cobra into a household name since founding the brand in 1989, said soaring costs across the supply chain, from manufacturing and energy to freight and staffing, meant prices would have to rise.  “Our input costs in every way – bottling, energy – are up,” he told BBC Radio5 Live’s Wake Up To Money programme. “Freight costs have soared, sometimes 10 times. Wages are increasing and on top of that there are labour shortages. It does mean that businesses have to put up prices. But the consumer is already feeling the squeeze. It is a really challenging situation for everyone.” Bilimoria, who would not be drawn on how much more drinkers would have to pay for a bottle of beer, joins a chorus of business leaders warning that consumers will soon face another round of significant price rises. On Sunday, the Tesco chairman, John Allan, said the “worst is yet to come” on food price inflation as he predicted it would reach 5% by spring. The warnings come as households face a significant hit to finances with inflation at a 30-year high of 5.4%, with further increases predicted later this year, energy bills set to soar under new price cap rules from April, as well as an increase in tax. “Price rises are a necessity, there is no running away from that,” said Bilimoria, who reiterated his opposition to the government’s plan to increase national insurance in April. “This is completely the wrong time to do this,” he said. “It will stifle investment, it will stifle growth.” Late last year, hospitality bosses urged consumers not to desert their local pub during “dry January”, when many people make a new year pledge to abstain from alcohol, as venues struggled to recover from poor Christmas trading. Takings over the festive period, seen as crucial for pubs, bars and restaurants, slumped as much as 60% compared with pre-pandemic levels as the industry suffered for a second Christmas in a row. In November, members of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association warned of a potential Christmas alcohol shortage due to supply chain chaos caused by a lack of HGV drivers.",News/Business,"UK beer prices pushed up by ‘vicious cycle’ of costs, says Cobra founder",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/07/uk-beer-prices-costs-says-cobra-lord-bilimoria
2/7/2022,"Hong Kong has reported a record 614 new cases of Covid-19, the vast majority of them the highly transmissible Omicron variant, but authorities are sticking to their guns on the territory getting back down to zero. On Monday the authorities reported the city’s highest daily number of cases since the pandemic began, a doubling of the previous day’s total, with more than a third untraceable. Another 600 cases were recorded as preliminarily positive. The sharp rise was attributed to last week’s Lunar New Year festivities, although the overall outbreak began late last year.  But government officials said they remained optimistic that Hong Kong’s tracing and containment strategies, which include snap lockdowns of buildings and mandatory testing and quarantine, would bring the outbreak under control. They urged people to “minimise mixing and stay home”. “If you continue with such gatherings the epidemic will not stop, but if we all work together and minimise social gatherings hopefully from today we can actually suppress the spread of the disease,” said the controller of the Centre for Health Protection, Edwin Tsui. Much of Hong Kong has already been shut down. Entertainment and public venues – even open spaces such as playgrounds and beaches – have been closed or told to suspend operations. Restaurants are barred from serving after 6pm, and gatherings of more than four people are banned. Charlie, a 26-year-old Hongkonger from North Point, said he worried the outbreak was out of control and feared further restrictions. “It affects me a lot in my life. Like the increased restrictions and buildings lockdown, or the forced [isolation] in Penny’s Bay [despite] no symptoms: It makes me worried every time I go out,” he said. “I have taken the vaccine (including booster shots), but there is no exception for that. These measures and controls affect my mental health a lot, and I wish to leave Hong Kong one day if I get the opportunity. I have been trying to stay strong, as I know life has to go on.” The city’s government must be at zero-Covid before mainland China agrees to open borders with it, a step which the Hong Kong government has prioritised over reopening to the rest of the world. Polls suggest the public support this approach. It has maintained one of the world’s best Covid responses in terms of keeping case numbers low, but has also sparked widespread frustration and confusion among the population with frequently changing and sometimes illogical measures. Hong Kong’s policy of sending all positive cases to hospital has also put a strain on resources, with CPH officials on Monday admitting bed availability was “becoming really tight”. More than 1,600 cases were at the North Lantau hospital infection control centre, including two in critical condition. In response to the strain on hospitals, some mild, asymptomatic or vaccinated Covid-19 patients would now be moved to the Penny’s Bay quarantine centre to recover, officials said. Some close contacts would also be allowed to isolate at home instead of the centres. Lawrence, a Hong Kong resident originally from overseas, said most people he knew “wouldn’t dream of getting tested and coming forward” because of the strict requirements and possible lengthy separation from family, children and work, even if they weren’t ill. He said the government “singlemindedly obsesses with getting back to zero Covid” in order to please Beijing, despite advances with vaccines and treatments greatly reducing mortality rates. “It’s crushing, after two years,” said Lawrence, who did not want his surname to be published. “It [was] a wonderful safe place while the rest of the world figured out what to do … but [the fear of ] admitting we were wrong means they’ll probably lock us down and then realise Omicron can’t be controlled.” Hong Kong is also battling low vaccination rates among the elderly population, many of whom had heeded earlier advice that with no cases they were better off not risking side-effects. The authorities have renewed pleas that all eligible people get the shot. Hong Kong has now reached a rate of 80% double-dosed, but less than 32% of those aged 80 or above have received at least one. Speaking to the Guardian from a vaccination hub where he was receiving his booster, Lawrence said it appeared busy with people getting their first dose, suggesting some were now taking the advice. Prof Ben Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong, told the Guardian that Hong Kong was in the more challenging phase of its “dynamic zero” strategy, which allowed the city to relax when it was at zero but required an agile switch to containment when there were cases. “If you have cases in the community and don’t realise it, and you didn’t switch to the zero phase, then it’s going to be worse off,” he said last week. “In Hong Kong now it’s going to be challenging to get back down to zero.” Cowling said the number of cases in Hong Kong was likely to be far higher than what was being reported. Cowling noted the near daily detections of unknown cases via the sewage surveillance process, which randomly targets about 100 of Hong Kong’s numerous high-rise buildings each day.",News/World news,Hong Kong reports highest number of Covid cases since pandemic began,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/07/hong-kong-reports-highest-number-of-covid-cases-since-pandemic-began
2/7/2022,"Even Olivier Giroud was starting to wonder if he might have jinxed himself. The Frenchman had no hesitation in accepting Milan’s No 9 shirt after he joined last summer, shrugging off the fact that no player in a decade had hit double figures while wearing it in Serie A. Ten players had tried and failed – among them such talented goalscorers as Gonzalo Higuaín, Fernando Torres and André Silva – but Giroud insisted: “I’m not superstitious.” By the turn of the year, he was sounding a little less confident. “I don’t believe in the curse of the No 9 shirt,” he told Milan’s in-house TV station in January. “But I have thought about it a few times after all these physical issues I’ve been having.” Giroud had begun confidently, scoring twice in his home debut: a 4-1 win over Cagliari. Since then, though, his season had been a constant stop-start. He missed time due to Covid, then lower back pain, then a hamstring injury. Prior to Saturday’s derby against Inter, he had started seven league games in six months.  He had scored five times, yet Giroud’s most memorable involvement might have come during a 1-0 loss at home to Napoli in December, when he was ruled offside in the buildup to what would have been an equalising goal from Franck Kessié. That decision was contested, and the chance would never even have materialised without the striker’s smart knock-down, but since when have hexes been fair? Milan’s manager, Stefano Pioli, continued to show confidence in Giroud, naming him in the starting XI to face Inter and describing him as a player of “international character”. Then again, what choice did he have? Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Ante Rebic were both unavailable. Giroud was the only fit striker in the first-team squad. Inter planned to make him irrelevant. The Nerazzurri arrived for this fixture as Serie A leaders, four points clear of their neighbours at the top and holding a game in hand. This was their chance to deliver a knockout blow in the title race, and for 75 minutes on Saturday it appeared they would do exactly that. From the opening whistle they dominated Milan, dictating where the game would be played even while holding a smaller share of possession. Pioli had set out to claim the middle of the pitch, deploying Kessié as a muscular No 10 to shut down Marcelo Brozovic’s lines of distribution. Inter simply shuttled their attacks down the flanks instead, Ivan Perisic and Denzel Dumfries launching continuous assaults. Un Derby da brividi, brividi, brividi… 🎧🎶🔊 #InterMilan 🔊#SerieATIM 💎 #WeAreCalcio @acmilan @_OlivierGiroud_ pic.twitter.com/uSN6vNegWX It was the Croatian who broke the deadlock in the 38th minute, volleying home from a corner, but Inter ought to have scored sooner. Only a string of reflex stops from the Milan goalkeeper, Mike Maignan, prevented the champions from putting the game to bed within the opening half hour. He was called on less frequently after the interval, yet there was still no hint of an imminent Milan fightback. Giroud was doing the best he could as a target-man, playing with his back to goal and winning the high balls, but he was starved of support, Perisic and Dumfries pinning Milan’s full-backs, Davide Calabria and Theo Hernández, in their own half. Then, with 20 minutes to go, Inter began to retreat into a more defensive stance. Simone Inzaghi withdrew Perisic and Lautaro Martínez together in the 70th minute, and Hakan Calhanoglu in the 73rd. On came Alexis Sánchez, Federico Dimarco and Arturo Vidal. Each of these decisions could be justified. Perisic had asked to come off after feeling a calf muscle tighten. Calhanoglu had been brilliant against his former club, and set up Inter’s goal, but was on a yellow card at a point when the game was becoming more fractious. Lautaro was disappointingly anonymous. Collectively, though, those changes felt like a retreat. Giroud accepted the invitation to lead an immediate counter-charge. Sánchez was still getting his bearings when his former Arsenal teammate thundered in to steal the ball off him in the middle of the park. The pair collided violently, spilling to the floor, but Giroud was immediately back on his feet and chasing forward as Sandro Tonali seized possession and advanced to the edge of the Inter box before squaring a pass to Brahim Díaz. The Spaniard’s shot was blocked by Alessandro Bastoni but spun away to the left-hand corner of the six-yard box where Giroud, still running, arrived to slide it home. Against the run of play, Milan had equalised. Three minutes later, Giroud put them in front. If his first goal was a reward for single-minded commitment, then this was a reminder of the striker’s underappreciated technical craft. Closely-tracked by Stefan De Vrij as he ran on to a Calabria through-ball down the right channel, Giroud lost his man with a Cruyff turn before sweeping a shot across Samir Handanovic and into the bottom of the net. The keeper could have done better, but that should not take away from the quality of the goal. You could hardly call this a fluke for Giroud, who scored from an almost identical turn against Liverpool at Anfield six years before. Outplayed for so long, Milan nevertheless had little trouble defending the advantage once they had earned it. The 21-year-old Tonali set the tone, throwing himself into every challenge and fronting up to Inter players – at times more than he probably should – who tried to talk back to his teammates during breaks in play. Fiorentina 0-3 Lazio, Inter 1-2 Milan, Roma 0-0 Genoa, Juventus 2-0 Verona, Udinese 2-0 Torino, Venezia 0-2 Napoli, Sampdoria 4-0 Sassuolo, Bologna 0-0 Empoli, Atalanta 1-2 Cagliari  This is the Milan that Pioli wants: a group who cannot yet match Inter for squad depth and experience but who can bridge that gap with furious commitment. A young team – the average age of their starting XIs this season is 25.6 years old – learning what it takes to win a big game. Sometimes it takes an older head to help you take the first steps. Giroud still needs another three goals to become the first Milan No 9 since Inzaghi to hit double figures in Serie A. But he hardly looked cursed by the shirt that he wore on Saturday evening.",Sport/Football,Giroud shrugs off shirt curse to put Milan on cloud nine in derby victory | Nicky Bandini,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/07/giroud-shrugs-off-shirt-curse-to-put-milan-on-cloud-nine-in-derby-victory
2/7/2022,"Born Peter James Andrea in Harrow, London, in 1973, and raised in Sydney, Australia, Andre is one of the quintessential 90s pop stars. After winning the TV talent show New Faces in Australia aged 16, he signed to a record label and launched his career in the UK, finding fame with the breakout hit Mysterious Girl and the accompanying video in which Andre body-rolls in a pair of jeans in the tropical sea.  After two No 1 singles, Andre retreated from the limelight before appearing on I’m a Celebrity … in 2004. On the show he met model and entrepreneur Katie Price, whom he married in 2005 and divorced in 2009. After a decade of reality TV, with multiple fly-on-the-wall franchises, Peter now lives in Surrey with his wife, NHS doctor Emily MacDonagh, and children. He is the co-founder of the “no guilt” health and fitness app #itsfine, available via Apple App Store and Google Play. Back in 1996, I was under the impression that proper fashion came in the form of incredibly baggy clothes. Instead of wearing tight stuff that showed off all my hard work training, I’d wear things that made me look completely shapeless. Like this “sauna suit” – it was my outfit for the Top of the Pops Weekend festival at Wembley Arena. I couldn’t bear the heat of it on my skin, so it would inevitably come off mid-song. Growing up, I used to study live footage of Prince and Michael Jackson; when I did my own shows I made sure to use similar lighting as I loved how it contoured their faces. Ironically, the night I did this gig Michael Jackson was playing Wembley Stadium and some of his dancers later told me that to try to make him laugh they put posters up around the venue with his face stuck on to photos of my shirtless body. As for my wet-look hair, I used this gel called Dark and Lovely. I’d buy massive tubs of it from a shop in Fulham in London when I lived there in the 90s. My apartment was right above PJ and Duncan’s. They used to bang their brooms on the ceiling late at night because I had parties all the time. This was before they became Ant and Dec, before they were TV gods, and had just done Let’s Get Ready to Rhumble. We were in competition with each other. But how life changed! Years later I remember seeing them heading off to the afterparties while I was the one going back home because I was over it. At the start of my career I had noticed guys like Marky Mark and Jean-Claude Van Damme were taking their tops off, and I wanted to do the same thing for pop. It was already happening in places like the UK with Take That, but my label wasn’t into it – they thought Aussies wouldn’t get it. My parents weren’t too keen either. When I was offered a deal aged 16, my mum was absolutely petrified – she said: “No, no, no, please no!” And I see why: they’re Jehovah’s Witnesses and were concerned my life would be all sex, drugs and rock’n’roll. I never took drugs, but I liked to party, had lots of girlfriends and made taking my shirt off my trademark. Throughout my life I’ve been accepted and rejected for my appearance. As a kid, I felt isolated because I was Greek and a “greasy wog”, as the kids and teachers used to call me. I took a lot of beatings for looking different; some were with fists and some were with stones. The knife that was pulled on me never went all the way in, but it certainly scared me enough to know that things could be over very quickly. What happened when I became famous and started attracting girls was another problem. The 90s were very image-based and no one knew me as a person, so I used to walk down the street and get called a wanker. Men would shout at me: “Who the f- do you think you are? If you look at my girl, I’ll kill you.” I don’t hold any grudges because I understand how it must have looked at the time: who is this guy walking around with his shirt off? Thankfully, as the years have gone on I’ve become a family man and do more interviews; people can now see that I’m not actually a little shit. At the peak of my pop powers I was polite to people, but I think I had a sense of arrogance that I now regret. I can kind of see how it happened: I was No 1 and the hysteria from the fans was crazy. I went from being a shy kid to having this huge confidence, touring the world and travelling to incredible places. We shot the video for Mysterious Girl on the Phi Phi Islands in Thailand; we arrived, set up the speakers, blasted out the song and shot footage of the local people dancing. I ended up going out with the girl in the video – a Swiss Thai model called Champagne X, who was a big star at the time – for a year and a half. She was such a sweet person, and it was only distance that made us break up. I’ve definitely got a complex emotional attachment to food. I don’t know if I’d consider it a disorder, but from the age of 15 until I was nearly 30, I watched everything I ate. I used to eat egg whites, protein powders, creatine and amino acids. I would get up in the morning and do sit-ups and push-ups before I even went downstairs. These days if I don’t have my double espresso I can’t even talk, let alone do a sit-up! But when you’re so focused on your ambitions you’ll do whatever it takes, sometimes to your own detriment. Then I had a funny few years in my 30s when I came out of the I’m a Celebrity … jungle and put on 3st. I fell into ex-footballer syndrome: I had the attitude of: “I don’t care. I’ve been training all my life, I don’t want to be told what to eat.” I needed a break. But I didn’t like how that made me feel either. I tried every fad diet to lose the weight: Atkins, Keto, no fat, no carbs, and all of it did the same thing. All of it made me lose weight, put it back on and then some. When I hit 40, everything changed. I found a balance, the one we are always told about, but that seems so hard to achieve. I generally eat healthily, but some days I do want to have a doughnut with my coffee. Am I as ripped as I was? No, but I’m not in bad shape for my age. That doesn’t mean I’d have the confidence to take my shirt off now though. The problem with being so motivated to have such a ripped body when I was young was that I built a rod for my own back. Even though I am decades older, I still think: “Oh no, keep your clothes on, people will just compare your body to the body in your younger photos.” You’ll never see me walking around a beach with my top off. Or on stage. Maybe for a laugh, but it’s unlikely. During that first part of my career I was on top of the world, but I recognise how fragile fame can be, what a vulnerable position you’re put in. You can easily believe your own hype and go either of two ways: off the rails and completely lose the plot; or have the moment, step away from it, come back and enjoy it the second time. Or the third time.

Meanwhile, toast the almonds in a warm pan for a few minutes, then roughly chop. In a bowl, make the lemon-tahini yoghurt. Using a fork, beat the tahini with the remaining tablespoon of oil and the lemon zest and juice, then slowly combine with the yoghurt, and season. Warm the flatbreads in an oven or on a griddle. Spoon the yoghurt on to a platter, top with the sprouts, dot with dollops of the harissa mix and sprinkle over the almonds and sumac. Serve with the breads for scooping.

2/7/2022,"Boris Johnson is “not a complete clown”, his new communications director has said, as he revealed the prime minister initiated a defiant rendition of Gloria Gaynor’s I Will Survive when the pair met last week. Days after being appointed No 10’s chief spin doctor following a clearout of aides over the “partygate” scandal, Guto Harri said the government would be more “focused on delivery” with a beefed-up team of staff who were more experienced and less ideological.  Harri, a Welsh-speaking former aide to Johnson from Cardiff, said in an interview that Johnson was “aware of the appalling misery” that the string of gatherings being investigated by Scotland Yard for breaching Covid rules had caused. Speaking to Golwg.360, Harri said, in comments translated from Welsh to English, that the events had “shaken people’s trust in government and politics in general”. He said Johnson “has to persuade his party and people on the ground that he is still the man who got a comfortable majority as recently as two years ago”. Harri’s appointment has come under scrutiny after the Sun reported that in his previous post as a board director for Hawthorn Advisors, he lobbied the government on behalf of the Chinese tech giant Huawei. While it is rare for senior advisers to make public comments, Harri broke cover over the weekend to tackle Dominic Cummings – a former No 10 adviser who has been deeply critical of Johnson – on Twitter. In fresh comments published on Monday, Harri said that his “taking the knee” in support of the Black Lives Matter movement on GB News last July was chided by Johnson when they met face-to-face for the first time in years. Harri revealed he was called in to see Johnson at 5pm on Friday, 24 hours after it was announced Jack Doyle had resigned as communications director. Doyle is understood to have been at a Downing Street Christmas party on 18 December, and previously offered his resignation, though it was rejected. Recalling the conversation he had with Johnson, Harri said: “Although I haven’t seen him in person for years, we picked up where we left things, in terms of the tone of our friendship. “I walked in, I saluted to the PM and said: ‘Prime minister, Guto Harri reporting for duty.’ “He stood up from behind his desk and started to take the salute but he said: ‘What am I doing? I should take the knee for you.’ “The two of us laughed. Then I asked: ‘Are you going to survive, Boris?’ “And he said in his deep voice – slow and purposeful – starting to sing a little while finishing the sentence and saying: ‘I will survive.’ “I inevitably invited him to say: ‘You’ve got all your life to live,’ and he replied: ‘I’ve got all my love to give,’ so we had a little blast from Gloria Gaynor! “No one expects that, but that’s how it was.” Harri said there was “a lot of laughing” and the pair had “a serious conversation about how we get the government back on track and how we move forward”. He added: “Everyone’s focus has been on recent events that have caused a lot of hurt, but in the end, that’s nothing to do with the way people voted two years ago. “He’s not a complete clown, but he’s a very likable character … He is not a vicious man as some misrepresent him. ” On Sunday, Harri told the Guardian he was “proud to join a team of capable, grownup, professional and pragmatic people that will hopefully allow the PM and his cabinet to operate effectively and deliver what they promised to the people”. He added that there were big post-pandemic challenges that they would “really need to get on with”. Harri’s appointment follows the news that Steve Barclay – the Cabinet Office minister and chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster – will fill the No 10 chief of staff role vacated by Dan Rosenfield at the end of last week.",News/Politics,"Boris Johnson ‘not a complete clown’, says his new press chief",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/07/boris-johnson-not-a-complete-clown-says-guto-harri-new-press-chief
2/7/2022,"A Cornish fishing village familiar to fans of gentle comedy drama is facing a crisis because part of its sea defences are crumbling and there are no longer enough working boats to fund the repairs. Householders in Port Isaac, the setting for the long-running ITV show Doc Martin, are worried that if one of the breakwaters that protect the picturesque village are not repaired, homes could be inundated when Atlantic storms sweep in.  For a century, fishing boat owners have clubbed together to maintain the breakwaters, but there are only two full-time working vessels left in the harbour and they cannot afford to pay for the work. The Port Isaac harbour commissioners have launched an online appeal to try to raise £40,000 for the work. Dugald Sproull, the chair of the commissioners, said: “It’s very sad. When I was a lad the whole place was about fishing. The industry has died a death. The problem now is there are only two full-time commercial fishing boats left. We have lost half a dozen or more in the past few years, more by coincidence that anything else – people have got old or had an accident with a lobster pot or whatever. The fishing is going down the pan.” A chunk of the eastern breakwater, built in the 1920s to protect the exposed port on the rugged north coast, has collapsed. The final cost of repairs is not known yet but Sproull said it was is clear it would be “eye watering”. Sproull said homes and businesses would be at risk if the breakwater was further damaged. “The bottom of the village is really at risk,” he said. In their appeal, the commissioners say: “In recent years the commercial boats in Port Isaac have depleted from around 10 to just two. If there are no commercial boats left in the harbour, there will be no one around to look after the infrastructure, and it will be only a matter of time until the breakwaters fall in to disrepair and, with sea levels rising, the bottom of the village will be regularly flooded and become unsustainable and uninsurable.” They would also like to carry out repairs to the harbour’s 16th-century fishing cellars and a path that leads to the breakwaters. They conclude: “Your support would mean everything to this tiny corner of Cornwall and would benefit every local, holidaymaker, business owner and Port Isaac lover alike.” The commissioners do get paid by the people behind Doc Martin, which is filming this year for a new series. Some of the funds they receive for the right to film in the village are expected to go towards the cost of the breakwater. Each year tens of thousands of Doc Martin pilgrims throng to Port Isaac. There may also be help from the sea shanty and folk group Fisherman’s Friends, who are based in Port Isaac. Choirs helped raise money for the breakwaters 100 years ago, and it is a consoling thought that the group may come to the village’s aid in its hour of need now by holding charity events. The harbourmaster and fishing boat skipper Tom Brown said: “In years gone by we’d all get together to sort out the repairs, but the breakwater has been pretty badly damaged and it’s going to cost mega money to repair it.” Brown, a fifth-generation fisher, said: “If we get a 40ft or 50ft sea, without a breakwater there’s going to be big flooding problems. It’s feeling quite bleak at the moment.”",News/UK news,Cornish home to TV’s Doc Martin appeals for sea defence funds ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/07/cornwall-village-port-isaac-doc-martin-appeals-for-sea-defence-funds
2/7/2022,"Few will challenge Alcina’s claims to contain some of the finest vocal writing that even Handel ever penned. The problem is with staging it. Under the skin, Alcina engages with serious stuff – desire, betrayal, rejection and trust. But the plot – an island enchantress battles to retain power over her lovers – is wrapped in artifice and improbability. Many productions fall short. Tim Albery’s intelligent staging for Opera North – the first of several Alcinas in the UK over the coming months – is, ultimately, another of them. Albery’s achievement is to have cleared enough of Alcina’s clutter to ensure focus on the work’s emotional core. The score is heavily cut, reshaped into two acts, not three. Hannah Clark’s perky designs, stripped back and sustainable, consist of 1960s upholstered chairs and a bearskin rug. Costumes are contemporary, save the occasional sword and breastplate. Ian Galloway’s video backdrop initially suggests an island of dreams but morphs into an oppressive heart of darkness jungle.  The theatrical impact, however, is fitful. That’s partly the doing of Handel’s Ariosto-derived libretto. But it is also because the tensions between the principal emotional triangle – Alcina, her lover, Ruggiero, and his wife, Bradamante (disguised as a man), all remained here at too low a key. The subsidiary relationship between Alcina’s sister Morgana and her suitor Oronte, by contrast, was very effectively done. All this could be resolved, as it often is in Alcina, by standout singing. Here, however, vocal standards were satisfactory but unexceptional. Máire Flavin seems to possess the voice for the title role but, at least on the opening night, her outbursts of passion and anger against Ruggiero did not wring the withers as they should. The US countertenor Patrick Terry has the big role of Ruggiero well within his compass. He sang his famous farewell to the island impeccably, but the intonation wandered a little at other times. Mari Askvik’s tastefully sung Bradamante was too vocally discreet to seize the gender fluid opportunities in Albery’s direction. It was left to Fflur Wyn’s Morgana to bring a bit more life to the proceedings, and not just in her showpiece act one aria (which some Alcinas steal for themselves). She and Nick Pritchard’s Oronte provided the most touching performances of the evening. The excellent Laurence Cummings conducted with a good mix of Handelian vigour and langour.  Alcina is at Grand theatre, Leeds, on 8, 15 and 17 February, then touring until 24 March.

2/7/2022,"For a short period in the 1990s, it seemed that Labour would launch a communitarian counter-revolution to bring the curtain down on the Thatcher era. Listen to a youthful Tony Blair in 1996, addressing the Women’s Institute: “At the heart of my beliefs is the idea of community,” said Blair. “I don’t just mean the villages, towns and cities in which we live. I mean that our fulfilment as individuals lies in a decent society of others. My argument to you today is that the renewal of community is the answer to the challenges of a changing world.” That zeal for a politics which challenged the individualism of the age did not last. As the Labour MP Jon Cruddas ruefully noted in his recent book, The Dignity of Labour, in power Blair and his party swerved off in a different direction. Choice, individual aspiration and the imperative to adapt to the consequences of globalisation became New Labour’s guiding themes. The party lost its focus when it came to protecting the self-esteem and interests of places in its post-industrial heartlands, although it did its best to keep many of them financially afloat. Disillusionment and a sense of anomie grew, paving the way for the red wall Brexit vote in 2016. Damaging divisions – cultural as well as economic – emerged between more prosperous, younger cities and declining, ageing towns; between the highly educated and those without a degree, and between an asset-rich generation and those who would never own their own homes. Faith in a social contract that bound the nation together – and in Labour’s ability to secure it – faded.  Cruddas believes it could have gone differently. Last month, delivering a speech on the concept of the common good at St Mary’s Catholic university in Twickenham, he confessed to his audience: “To me with hindsight, 1996 is a story of paths not taken, of missed opportunities.” The result, he argued, “was a sense of powerlessness that people feel, of exclusion and estrangement, a lack of participation; a lack of virtue in our institutions and our politics”. Could the Labour party now resume the mission that Blair abandoned? Suddenly, the early 2020s have begun to feel a little like the mid-1990s. Like John Major’s government a quarter of a century ago, Boris Johnson’s is beset by scandal. The prime minister is a wounded, diminished figure. While Major suffered byelection humiliation in the safe Tory seat of Christchurch, Johnson has endured Chesham and Amersham, and North Shropshire. And, as last week’s underwhelming “levelling up” white paper laid bare, Johnson’s own version of a communitarian project – designed to consolidate the new red wall intake of Tory voters – is being starved of cash by a party that no longer trusts him. If he is replaced between now and the next election, none of his potential successors (other than possibly Michael Gove), have an authentic instinct for the concerns of the northern Labour voters who helped deliver an 80-seat majority. There is an opportunity here for Keir Starmer that goes beyond the outcome of the next election. Johnson’s essential unseriousness – and his party’s faithfulness to the Thatcher legacy – means that he is destined to squander the chance to forge a genuine Tory One Nation response to a divided country. But multiple signs of our times suggest that a yearning persists for a vision which recognises that “our fulfilment as individuals lies in a decent society of others”. In Labour’s tradition, this sense of the “we” being as important as the “I” used to be expressed in the collective solidarity and self-help movements that drove the working-class politics of the industrial age. It was found in the commitment to the idea of the common good which was taught from the pulpits of “Labour churches”. In our liberal, secular and more atomised age, it is the inner meaning – the overlapping DNA – of phenomena as apparently disparate as the rise of leftwing Scottish nationalism; towns that yearn for the restoration of civic pride; the desire for a dignified social care system; pride in the armed forces and the British flag; the consistently strong support for enhanced forms of public ownership, and the solidarity shown by communities towards key workers and vulnerable members during the Covid pandemic. The root intuition, sidelined for 40 years, is that as political, social animals we are about far more than the pursuit of self interest, and our mutual dependency defines us as much as our individual liberties. How can Labour open up this ethical seam in the landscape that was so vividly glimpsed by the early Blair? Some ideas are offered in Labour’s Covenant, an ambitious pamphlet released last month by the Labour Together group in which Cruddas is involved. The essay is a precis of two years’ worth of discussions with academics, policy experts and Labour MPs, mayors and councillors. Covering the piste from the future of the union to foreign policy, its scope is wide. But the essential spirit of Labour’s Covenant is local. Proposals range from the promotion of regional banks and vocational colleges to drive local economies – and to give young people options to stay in places where they grew up – to the need to invest in locations where people from different backgrounds meet, talk, argue and laugh – the “post offices, pubs, community centres, art galleries, parks, nurseries, hospitals and schools”. The abstract term for this kind of thing is “social infrastructure”. It requires far more investment in people and institutions than the Conservatives’ levelling up programme is offering. And if places and regions are truly to be empowered, Whitehall will have to give away revenue-raising powers and resources to an extent that no government has contemplated in the past. But as the Conservative party reverts to type, Labour should draw on its own rich heritage to do the job of “renewing community” properly and with conviction. In a society that knows itself to be fractured and divided, this task can unite red-wall and blue-wall aspirations and appeal across the generations. Seeking to claim one-nation politics for the left in 2012, Ed Miliband brought the philosopher Michael Sandel to the Labour party conference. In an address that proved startlingly prescient given the Brexit psychodrama that would soon unfold, Sandel told delegates: “Democracy does not require perfect equality. But it does require that citizens share a common life. What matters is that people of different social backgrounds … bump up against one another. Because this is how we come to negotiate and abide our differences.” This was true then and remains so now, and Sandel’s insights were heavily drawn upon by Germany’s new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, in the Social Democratic party’s election campaign. A radical politics of place can enable a renewed common life to flourish and prosper. The Tories will not deliver it. Labour could.

2/7/2022,"Julian Nagelsmann has missed this kind of competition and so, in recent months, has the Bundesliga. This felt just like a Saturday night Top-Spiel should, a meeting of minds, of wills, of guts. RB Leipzig have not shone this season like the upstarts they have been since promotion in 2016 – they have been “playing below their potential … it’s no secret”. as Thomas Müller put it at full-time – but they came to Bayern Munich with what a lot of teams leave at home. Hunger and bravery. On a weekend when Borussia Dortmund underlined that their nominal title challenge is barely even that, this was a ray of light tentatively pointing towards a more competitive future race at the top. Germany’s football critics relished it too. “The fact that [Domenico] Tedesco’s team had stood up to Bayern for so long with a courageous and attacking approach was remarkable,” wrote Süddeutsche Zeitung’s Philipp Schneider.  That’s right, Tedesco. His presence on the Leipzig bench is exactly why this was so keenly anticipated, with he and Nagelsmann coming face to face for the first time since the former’s Schalke visited the latter’s Hoffenheim in December 2019. The two were famously coursemates at the DFB’s coaching school, graduating from the same class in 2016 – and naturally the Bayern coach was asked yet again in the buildup to the game about Tedesco getting the higher mark on their course. If Nagelsmann recalled and regretted trying to be too cool on his first day, turning up late to find the only seats left were under full teacher scrutiny at the front – “the others could watch the Lord of the Rings trilogy 44 times while I couldn’t even Google anything” – he was clear about relishing the battle here. This was the pair locking horns at the top table for the first time which German football might well have anticipated, but the two protagonists themselves were looking forward to a heck of a lot more. Tedesco and Nagelsmann are competitive spirits as well as friends. Schalke’s time under Tedesco seems like decades ago because so much has happened there since. It had started brilliantly before going south in the second season and just as it is now clear that the slump was the tip of a much bigger iceberg at the club, we have seen since that with different players and in a different environment, the coach isn’t all about caution. Nagelsmann had warned in the days before the game that under his friend, Leipzig are “much more about possession”, and their refusal to be cowed made this a game to savour. Bayern took an early lead, so André Silva hit back after a Leipzig swarm in the home side’s box. They conceded the inevitable goal to Robert Lewandowski just before half-time, so they came back with a fine second equaliser from Christopher Nkunku. Only a Joško Gvardiol own goal, unfortunately flicked in when trying to block a Serge Gnabry cross, sealed the deal. This was a sign of hope, rather than a gauntlet laid – “think positive, stay realistic,” as Leipziger Volkszeitung’s Norbert Wehtstedt wrote – but set intentions. Bayern’s hunger is different, a combination of their potential to become something even greater under Nagelsmann and the possible upheaval to come, with a line of thorny contractual issues to sort out. The most immediate of those are Gnabry and Corentin Tolisso, who continued his run of fine form and was involved in the first two goals. Yet with Niklas Süle on the way out (which Manuel Neuer said had left the team “annoyed”), it is clear that some tough decisions will have to be made, and not everyone will get what they want. 📽️ A true tug of war this evening where @FCBayernEN ultimately came out on top, but not without having to put in a serious shift. 🪢#FCBRBL pic.twitter.com/47JmIYtB34 In the short-term Neuer’s meniscus operation, which will keep him out of the Champions League ties with Salzburg, gives the coach something extra to deal with. Even with that concern Nagelsmann would be forgiven a wry smile on Saturday night over what Tedesco is already doing with his old team – and, for the Bundesliga’s sake, over what might develop into a satisfying rivalry in the coming weeks, months and years. Hertha Berlin 1-1 Bochum, Bayern Munich 3-2 Leipzig, Stuttgart 2-3 Eintracht Frankfurt, Mainz 2-0 Hoffenheim, Augsburg 2-0 Union Berlin, Cologne 1-0 Freiburg, Arminia Bielefeld 1-1 Mönchengladbach, Wolfsburg 4-1 Greuther Furth, Borussia Dortmund 2-5 Bayer Leverkusen  Dortmund’s “disastrous day” (as per Marco Reus) followed as they slumped to a 5-2 home defeat against Leverkusen – with relatively little material consequence as nobody is expecting them to catch Bayern and they are still five points clear of Gerardo Seoane’s team in third – but spoke loudly of their inertia. This match, and performance, was a near-twin of the home defeat by Stuttgart, less than 14 months ago, which brought the end of the Lucien Favre reign. Every time Marco Rose’s team lost the ball, they looked like conceding, making one wonder what exactly they had done in the mini-hiatus. As Rose led his players to the Südtribune to applaud the fans, loud booing echoed around from the 10,000 fans present, and he was confronted by a supporter behind the dugout (“when children have to hear that stuff, it’s difficult”). The absence of the injured Erling Haaland was the last thing on minds, with BVB having plenty to ponder.  Borussia Mönchengladbach began the post-Max Eberl era with a strong indication of how much work they have ahead of them in a 1-1 draw at Arminia Bielefeld, salvaged by Alassane Pléa’s first goal since November. “What is encouraging,” wrote Bild’s Dirk Krümpelmann, “is that the team finally seem to have understood they are in a relegation battle,” and maybe the emotional shock of the popular Eberl’s is the impetus Gladbach required. “It was a step forward,” said Yann Sommer. “We wanted to play with courage despite our situation.” They now move on to to a crucial game with fellow strugglers (and current play-off place occupants) Augsburg, who are now just a point behind Gladbach after beating Union 2-0, with Michael Gregoritsch gifted an opener before André Hahn drove in a magnificent second from range.  Wolfsburg got the win they – and coach Florian Kohfeldt – desperately needed, beating Greuther Fürth 4-1. It wasn’t overwhelmingly impressive but a first win in two months was fired by a double from teenager Aster Vranckx, who showed signs of clicking with the newly returned Max Kruse. The sort of fun that might come with Kruse was flagged when his wife Dilara revealed the fee that Die Wölfe paid to bring him back from Union (€5m, since you ask) on an Instagram live Q&A.  With Köln coach Steffen Baumgart quarantining after a positive Covid test, his assistant André Pawlak took charge for the game with Freiburg (“I won’t wear a flat cap,” Pawlak had deadpanned before the game). He didn’t need to, with Baumgart doing his usual furious pacing in front of the television at home, giving WhatsApp voicenote instructions to the team analyst, all as shown on his daughter Emilia’s TikTok account, complete with the trademark cap on and his dog resting on his shoulders like an attentive member of backroom staff. Anthony Modeste’s stylish winner eventually ensured a happy afternoon at home for the Baumgarts. “My attitude on game day doesn’t change just because I’m at home,” he later admitted to Bild. “My wife knew what to expect.”",Sport/Football,Nagelsmann v Tedesco lives up to hype as Leipzig push Bayern all the way | Andy Brassell,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/07/nagelsmann-v-tedesco-does-not-disappoint-as-leipzig-push-bayern-all-way
2/7/2022,"From Laura Bush’s famous radio speech declaring that the invasion of Afghanistan would liberate its women, to the Trump administration’s invocation of women’s rights as it pulled out of the nuclear deal with Iran, war-making in the modern world is often linked to gender equality. Those who push the west to take a muscular approach to advancing its interests in distant places, through bombing, droning or economic warfare, like to weave sepia-tinted images of women in miniskirts into their advocacy. Whatever the actual motives, accompanying them with rhetoric about securing women’s freedom has become standard practice during western interventions.  These cynical moves are often what come to mind when we hear the words “ethical foreign policy”. But a whole realm of quiet work lies beyond them. As it stands, much of western foreign policy is concerned with shoring up peace and stability in areas of strategic interest to governments. That includes dispatching advisers to improve developing countries’ militaries, supporting healthcare and education through development aid, and doing diplomatic work to get disagreeing parties to negotiate before things deteriorate too far. For years now, various governments have woven gender equality into these efforts. When development aid sits formally in the same department as foreign policy, as it now does in Britain, those efforts can get serious political backing. The notion that feminism should inform foreign policy has deep roots. Activists from around the world, but especially in developing countries, have gathered for decades to demand that states listen to their needs and create foreign policies that actually address them. Those efforts took concrete shape at the United Nations, leading to successive resolutions concerning women, peace and security. Feminist movements in the west also clamoured for governments to help implement abroad the kinds of reforms they were enacting at home. Underpinning all of this was a hard-nosed calculation about the pay-offs: that improving the wellbeing of women and girls would make countries more successful and less likely to experience hellish civil strife or to attack others. So has it been effective? Apart from less contentious measures, such as an increase in female peacekeepers, the drive for clean cooking stoves for the world’s poor and the push to involve women in security decision-making and peace negotiations, the answer partly depends on the strain of feminism you support. The legal scholar Catharine MacKinnon, for instance, has written: “In the American war against the Taliban, for a brief moment women had a foreign policy, or briefly became part of a pretext for one.” Hillary Clinton, who made women the centrepiece of US foreign policy, claims some progress has been made, and calls for more women in higher office, arguing that female leadership “contributes to greater cooperation, equality and stability”. But as Rafia Zakaria writes in her book Against White Feminism, politicians pursuing “feminist” foreign policies may simultaneously be making other choices that badly harm women, fuelling the conflicts that lead to their rape and impoverishment. How useful and feminist is it, she asks, for governments to demand Yemeni women be included in stalled peace talks, while selling arms to Saudi Arabia to use in that war? Even the development aid that governments earmark to advance gender equality, Zakaria argues, often ends up sapping women’s grassroots activism, incentivising people to pursue the largesse of NGOs rather than mobilise politically. There are even more sinister consequences to the west’s tendency to package together the use of armed force with promotion of western feminism. In many battlegrounds, it has allowed insurgent groups from Isis to the Taliban to repeat the trick in reverse, bundling their rallying cries of “anti-imperialism” together with anti-feminist ones. So would governments be better off dropping gender equality as a pillar of foreign policy entirely? Some prominent voices have said just that. Professor David Wood recently argued in an article that the quest for gender equality is fundamentally a domestic struggle. Not all conflicts, he believes, are driven or shaped by gender imbalances. By demanding that gender empowerment be baked into every effort to end wars, governments and donors may be chasing unrelated problems, and getting in the way of their efforts to stop violence. But to veer in this direction, even with the aim of overcorrecting faulty interventions and harmful policies, would be a mistake. Neither feminism nor gender equality can truly sit apart from global politics, when the conduct of dominant states so intimately shapes the lives and security of women and girls around the world, and especially in the global south. While there is much to criticise in the double standards and hypocrisies of some policies that invoke feminism, women’s wellbeing as an indicator of a society’s economic and political health remains crucial and revelatory. In Afghanistan today, for example, either the lives of Afghan women and girls matter, or they do not. If states are serious about their commitment to justice, they must first slow their immiseration and bring about some kind of deal with the Taliban, at least in its capacity as the present custodian of the Afghan state. Some find this prospect unacceptable, and doubtless there are passionate advocates on both sides. But only one will result in the material protection of women and girls, keeping the lights on in maternity wards and preventing the sale of girls as child brides by hungry families. A truly feminist foreign policy should not be a call to arms, or a new cold war against states that disagree with western values. Empowerment means listening to what people want, and helping them to achieve it.

2/7/2022,"The Biden administration set out 70 recommendations to encourage union membership in the US on Monday, including making it easier for many federal employees to join unions and eliminating barriers for union organizers to talk with workers on federal property. The report, compiled by the White House Task Force on Worker Organizing and Empowerment, reiterates Biden’s robust backing of unions. “At its core,” the report says, “it is our administration’s belief that unions benefit all of us.”  It adds: “Researchers have found that today’s union households earn up to 20% more than non-union households, with an even greater union advantage for workers with less formal education and workers of color.” The report comes amid a surge in interest in unions in the US and follows a wave of high-profile industrial actions last year. The taskforce, which includes 13 members of Biden’s cabinet and is chaired by vice-president Kamala Harris, calls for stepping up enforcement to ensure that money going to federal contractors – whether manufacturers, food-processing companies or other contractors – is not spent on anti-union campaigns. The taskforce calls for requiring disclosure of any instances when federal contractors use anti-union consultants or lawyers to persuade employees working on a federal contract not to unionize. While corporations typically prohibit union organizers from setting foot on company property – as Amazon has done recently in Alabama – the taskforce recommends removing many barriers that block union organizers from being able to talk with employees on federal property about the benefits of unionizing. This applies not just to federal employees, but also to employees of private contractors on federal property, such as a grocery store on a military base or in a national park. Biden said the taskforce’s charge was to identify executive branch policies, practices and programs that could be used “to promote my administration’s policy of support for worker power, worker organizing, and collective bargaining”. The taskforce said the range of policies and programs “that can be leveraged is significant”. Its recommendations include making the federal government a model employer in terms of shaping jobs, ensuring that federal employees know their labor rights, and improving labor-management communications. The federal government is the nation’s largest employer, with more than 2.1 million non-postal employees. Of those, 1.2 million are represented by unions, but only 33% of those workers pay union dues – that small percentage limits the power of federal employee unions. Noting that screeners for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) are largely excluded from having the collective bargaining rights available to other non-military federal employees, the taskforce instructed the Department of Homeland Security to issue expanded bargaining rights for TSA’s screening workforce. The report is likely to strengthen the notion that Biden is the most pro-union president since Franklin Roosevelt – and perhaps the most pro-union president in US history. That might help Biden when he seeks to persuade and mobilize union members to vote for Democrats this November. At the same time, the report’s pro-union tone and substance might result in more opposition from business. In its first sentence, the report says: “The Biden-Harris administration believes that increasing worker organizing and empowerment is critical to growing the middle class, building an economy that puts workers first, and strengthening our democracy.” The report catalogues several executive orders and other pro-union steps by the president and his administration. It reads: “Unions have fought for and helped win many aspects of our work lives many of us take for granted today, like the 40-hour work week and the weekend, as well as landmark programs like Medicare.” The report adds that research has shown that increased economic inequality, growing pay gaps for women and workers of color, and the declining voice of working-class Americans in the nation’s politics “are all caused, in part, by the declining percentage of workers represented by unions”. The taskforce calls on the Department of Labor – whose secretary, Martin Walsh, is the taskforce’s vice-chair – to become a resource center that provides materials on the advantages of union representation and collective bargaining.",News/US news,‘Unions benefit all of us’: new Biden plan encourages federal workers to unionize,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/07/biden-union-labor-white-house-organizing
