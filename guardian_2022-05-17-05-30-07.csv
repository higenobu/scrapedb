5/17/2022,"The world of football has united to offer praise and support to Jake Daniels, after the 17-year-old Blackpool forward came out as gay. The Football Association said Daniels, the first male professional footballer in the UK to come out since Justin Fashanu in 1990, was “an inspiration to us all”. In a statement the FA said: “We fully support your decision to be open about this part of yourself. Football is a game for all, with diversity at its heart, and this is a hugely positive step as we strive to build an inclusive game that we can all be proud of. We are with you and hope your story will help to give people across the game the strength and encouragement to be their true self.” Daniels has also received support from several prominent former players and pundits, after making the announcement on Monday with the help of his club, Stonewall and Sky Sports. “It’s been a brilliant season for you on the pitch, and now through your bravery, off the pitch too,” the BBC Match of the Day host, Gary Lineker, wrote. “I’m sure you’ll receive huge love and support from the football community and many others will follow your path. Good luck to you.” The former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand tweeted: “Massive respect for this brave decision. Let’s all help create a safe and supportive environment for LGBTQ+ people in football and beyond!” Thomas Hitzlsperger, who came out as gay shortly after his retirement, wished Daniels a wonderful career and said he was glad to see he had the support of his club and Stonewall. Ferdinand’s former teammate at United, the ex-England defender Gary Neville, said on Sky’s Monday Night Football programme that Daniels’s announcement “will go down in history” and could change the dressing-room culture in men’s football. “What he has just done takes incredible courage,” Neville said. “In a dressing room, that would seem like the unthinkable to announce you are gay. I can’t imagine how difficult that has been. All I would say is it’s a day of great importance for Jake and his family, but also for English football. It is a big, big moment for football. “The game has not dealt with this issue well at all. We know that now it is something that is acceptable from a fan point of view, but it’s not yet got into the dressing room. A dressing room can be an evil place … you think about the peer pressure and vulnerability. The way in which Jake spoke was absolutely incredible.” Neville’s colleague, the former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher, said: “I know the [Blackpool] manager Neil Critchley, I had a relationship with him at Liverpool. Neil will be a huge support mechanism for Jake because he will need that going forward. It’s not just about Jake, it’s about the football club and their role within it and it’s an example going forward for other clubs.” ""It's a day of great importance for English football""Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher discuss Blackpool's Jake Daniels coming out as gay - the first UK professional footballer to do so publicly since 1990pic.twitter.com/bZDhTylCVp Elsewhere, the Professional Footballers’ Association said it was “extremely proud of Jake … he has the complete support of everyone at the PFA”. The EFL chief executive, Trevor Birch, said: “We hope this moment helps take us forward to a time where LGBTQ+ representation at all levels of the men’s game is the norm.” Tony Burnett, chair of the anti-discriminatory campaign group Kick it Out, said football has “a renewed responsibility to [Jake] and the LGBTQ+ community at large … to ensure that he receives the right support now, and can continue on his footballing journey like any other 17-year-old”. Burnett said: “This is a big story, and a historic day in English football, but we need to remember that there is a young man at the heart of it. A young man who should not have to be defined by this one moment, or this one part of his identity. We wish Jake a long and successful career in football.” Stonewall, which will continue to offer Daniels and Blackpool “ongoing support”, said: “We are proud that Jake has felt able to share his truth with the world. Football is ready for this moment and we believe it has been for some time. This is an opportunity for everyone to support Jake and show football is everybody’s game.” In their own statement, Blackpool FC said they were “incredibly proud [Jake] has reached a stage where he is empowered to express himself both on and off the pitch”. The club added: “It is vital that we all promote an environment where people feel comfortable to be themselves, and that football leads the way in removing any form of discrimination and prejudice.”",Sport/Football,World of football unites in support for Jake Daniels after he comes out as gay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/16/jake-daniels-support-reaction-fa-efl-kick-it-out
5/17/2022,"Vladimir Putin has become so personally involved in the Ukraine war that he is making operational and tactical decisions “at the level of a colonel or brigadier”, according to western military sources. The Russian president is helping determine the movement of forces in the Donbas, they added, where last week the invaders suffered a bloody defeat as they tried on multiple occasions to cross a strategic river in the east of Ukraine. The sources added that Putin is still working closely with Gen Valery Gerasimov, the commander of the Russian armed forces, in contrast to claims made by Ukraine last week that the military chief had been sidelined. “We think Putin and Gerasimov are involved in tactical decision making at a level we would normally expect to be taken by a colonel or a brigadier,” the military source said, referring to the ongoing battle in the east of Ukraine. Moscow’s armies have so far failed to achieve a breakthrough in the Donbas, where they have been mounting an offensive for a month that has failed several times encircle the smaller Ukrainian forces. No further detail to back up the statement was provided, although the it was implied the assessment about Putin’s close personal involvement was based on intelligence that had been received. Colonels in the US army and brigadiers in the British army typically command a brigade, units made up of a handful of battalions – the latter of which is equivalent to the smallest operating unit in the Russian army. Russia’s military operates in a more top down fashion compared to western counterparts, with instructions typically sent to generals in the field. But Moscow’s faltering invasion has meant that it has been forced to send generals closer to the front line, where up to 12 have been killed, according to the Ukrainian armed forces. Ben Barry, a former brigadier in the British army, and a land warfare expert at the International Institute of Strategic Studies, said: “A head of government should have better things to do than make military decisions. They should be setting the political strategy rather than getting bogged down in day to day activity”. Last week’s failed attempt to cross the Siverskyi Donets river at Bilohorivka led to the destruction of more than 70 Russian vehicles, and the loss of at least one batallion’s worth of equipment, according to estimates based on aerial photography of the battle site. The defeat was so serious it led some Russian military bloggers to comment “on the incompetence of the Russian military to their hundreds of thousands of followers”, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a rare sign of internal dissent. In the past 24 hours, Russian forces shelled frontline positions in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas area as fighting becomes increasingly focused on Severodonetsk, the easternmost city still held by Ukrainian forces after more than 11 weeks of war. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk region, said on Monday that Russian strikes had hit a hospital in the city over the weekend, killing two and injuring nine, including a child – and several other locations had been targeted. Ukrainian forces repelled 17 attacks on Sunday, he added, and destroyed 11 Russian armoured vehicles. The Russians are gradually mounting an assault on Severodonetsk, an industrial city that had a population of 100,000 before the war, as the effort to complete a wider encirclement of Ukraine’s defending forces in the Donbas appears to have failed. Ukrainian forces also continued to push Russian forces back from Kharkiv, the country’s second biggest city, with Volodomyr Zelenskiy congratulating soldiers who erected a new border post on Russia’s border north of the city. “I’m very grateful to you, on behalf of all Ukrainians, on my behalf and on behalf of my family,” he said in a video message. “I’m very grateful to all the fighters like you.” Russia’s withdrawal is a fighting retreat, however, with the outlying northern villages around Kharkiv being peppered with shelling on Monday, with one person confirmed killed in Tsyrkuny, 17 miles from the city centre and four injured in the districts of Shevchenkivskyi and Saltivka. Ukrainian officials said that Russian forces were concentrating on “maintaining positions and preventing the advance of our troops toward the border”. Britain’s chief of defence staff, Adm Sir Tony Radakin, said he believed that Ukraine was now winning the war because Putin had wanted to “subjugate the whole of Ukraine” and “impose his own rule on that country” and had failed. Giving a speech in to a parliamentary audience in Westminster, the head of the UK armed forces said Ukraine was winning because it had fought off “an existential threat” and that “its nation is going to survive,” he added. The Institute for the Study of War said it believed “Russian forces have likely abandoned the objective of completing a large-scale encirclement of Ukrainian units from Donetsk City to Izium” in favour of capturing the remainder of the Luhansk region, of which Severodonetsk is part. A second smaller-scale encirclement of Severodonetsk also failed last week after Russian forces were defeated with heavy losses in a series of unsuccessful attempts to cross the Siverskyi Donets River at Bilohorivka. The river is increasingly becoming a dividing line between the two sides in the Donbas – the name given collectively to the Donetsk and Luhansk regions – and around Kharkiv to the north. Haidai said battles were taking place on Sunday to the north and south of Severodonetsk, which is one of the few locations held by Ukraine on the east side of the river. Analysts believe there may be a long struggle for the city. Konrad Muzyka, the founder of Rochan Consulting, which specialises in open source intelligence, said he believed the capture of Severodonetsk was weeks away. “Moscow … does not have the appropriate manpower and equipment levels to take the city swiftly,” he said in a weekly review of the fighting.",News/World news,"Putin involved in war ‘at level of colonel or brigadier’, say western sources",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/putin-involved-russia-ukraine-war-western-sources

5/17/2022,"The noises coming out of No 10 ahead of the prime minister’s visit to Northern Ireland had been rather more conciliatory. Obviously, there was no admission from Boris Johnson that he had actually negotiated and signed the deal involving the NI protocol, but that was always going to be a step too far. There’s only so much reality the Convict can take at any one time. And the bigger the truth, the harder he finds it to accept. But at least Johnson had this time bothered to get someone with a working knowledge of some of the sensitivities endemic to Northern Ireland to write the 2,000-word opinion piece on his behalf for the Belfast Telegraph. Normally, he’d have just scribbled something off the top of his head in about 30 minutes. This time there was an awareness he needed to produce something that in some way acknowledged the presence of both the nationalists and the unionists. Not to mention the EU. Allowing Liz Truss to sound off about unilaterally deciding to trigger article 16 and torpedo the protocol – initiating legislation to break the law was a new level of idiocy even for a paid-up member of the wankocracy – hadn’t gone down well in mainland Europe or Ireland. So now the Convict had been sure to keep things vague. Let’s forget he’d ever mentioned article 16 and just hope that somehow a compromise fudge might emerge. After all, with the economy tanking and inflation predicted to rise above 10% by the end of the year, now was probably not the time to start a trade war with your biggest and nearest trading partner. Just how screwed the UK economy really was soon became apparent at a meeting of the Treasury select committee where Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, deputy governor Dave Ramsden, and Michael Saunders and Jonathan Haskel, two economist wonks on the monetary policy committee, were giving evidence. The committee chair, Mel Stride, got things rolling by asking why the Bank of England had got its inflation forecasts so hopelessly wrong and whether it should have taken more action on increasing interest rates to ease the pressure. Bailey is a man who epitomises dullness. Someone not even his close friends and family find it easy to stay awake for. He speaks with the golden voice of a man who chews half a dozen Mogadon before he leaves the house in the morning. So for him to sound even slightly panicky is enough to send alarm bells ringing. It was like this, he said. At least 80% of the underlying causes of inflation he had no control over. He could only sit back and let the rise in energy prices and the war in Ukraine do its worst. He was powerless. Accept the things he cannot change. Yes, but ... Stride was not happy with this at all. He needed more certainty. He needed to know that the Bank of England had a clue what it was doing. Bailey looked him in the eye before slowly replying. You could summon all the hindsight you wanted but even then you could drag in a couple of punters who knew nothing about economics from the street and they probably wouldn’t do any worse than the MPC. It wasn’t just that 80% of the economy was a lawless jungle, far removed from any pathetic monetary levers he might try to use. It was also that he didn’t really have much of a clue about the 20% he would normally have some chance of controlling in times of less magical thinking. There was Covid in China. He had no idea how that was going to play out. And he had no idea why so many people had left the labour force. It could be that they all had long Covid. Or it could just be that hundreds of thousands had reckoned everything was so shit under the Tories that once lockdown ended they couldn’t be arsed to go back to work. Far better to put their feet up and take their chances at home. Might as well die happy. “I don’t want to panic you,” Bailey said. But he clearly did, because he then went on to point out there would soon be a food crisis. Wheat prices had gone up 25% in a matter of months. We were all going to starve. And the least we could all do is to not ask for a pay rise. That way the least well-off would be the first to go. Call it natural selection. And all the more nosh for him. Though he was at pains to point out he too had taken a wage freeze. Somehow he’d struggle by on £575,000 a year. Labour’s Rushanara Ali wondered how the MPC felt about being scapegoated by Liam Fox and other rightwing Tories for not having done more to combat inflation. Bailey shrugged. He could live with it. If the Tories really wanted to undermine the Bank’s independence and let the chancellor have a go, then they could be his guest. Though nothing Rishi Sunak had done on the cost of living crisis should have given them any reason to think he had any answers. The man was even more useless than him. The session meandered on for the best part of two hours with everyone in a state of denial. No one really wanted to acknowledge just how fucked the economy was and that no one had a clue what to do about it. Just hope things would return to normal at some point in the future and hope that some of us would be alive to see it. Don’t talk about the 80%. Or the 20% for that matter. Try to think of a happy place. And definitely don’t mention Brexit. The Tory MP Kevin Hollinrake tried to get Bailey to quantify the Brexit effect. “La, la, la,” said Bailey, putting his fingers in his ears. He wasn’t going to talk about Brexit. It was too difficult to disentangle from Covid. But it might have had some effect? Yes, no, maybe. Ramsden, the deputy guv’nor, eventually put Bailey out of his misery. Brexit was going to cause a 3.75% hit to GDP in the long term. But they’d already said that a long time ago and it was too painful to repeat. There was an embarrassed silence. Ramsden looked around guiltily. As though he’d messed himself. One of the biggest acts of self-harm and even the Bank of England and the Treasury select committee can barely bring themselves to mention it. Truly, we are screwed.",News/Business,Bailey sets alarm bells ringing while barely mentioning the B-word,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/16/andrew-bailey-bank-of-england-economy-sketch
5/17/2022,"Babis Anagnostopoulos: clever; photogenic; charistmatic; successful – all traits that perhaps allowed him to think he could fool the world. On Monday the game was up. Justice caught up with the helicopter pilot who finally admitted it was he who had suffocated his British wife, Caroline Crouch, just over a year ago. And justice was unsparing. At the end of a dramatic trial, whose every twist and turn had gripped Greece, a mixed court of jurors and judges unanimously agreed that the 34-year-old should receive the toughest penalty possible under Greek law: a life sentence for the premeditated murder of his partner; a jail term of 11 years and six months for the brutal killing of the family’s pet dog; and a fine of €21,000. Anagnostopoulos, who for almost six weeks had sought to pin the murder in the couple’s dream Athenian home on a gang of ruthless foreign thieves, will likely remain behind bars for several decades. After sentencing was passed, even his lawyer appeared to justify the judgment, saying the verdict was “expected”. But in truth, the story of Crouch’s death has made waves precisely because it confounded expectation. At barely 20, the young mother’s tragic end struck a chord at a time when the Mediterranean nation has also been hit by a wave of femicides. When the UK-trained pilot emerged dishevelled and distraught from the very building in suburban Athens where Caroline had taken her last breath – telling reporters he hoped no family would endure the same fate that his had been forced to bear – there was no one in Greece, or abroad, who did not sympathise. Against a backdrop of rising crime in the capital’s suburbs, a visibly shocked civil protection minister announced a €300,000 bounty to help unearth the culprits. As the weeks passed, with no evident breakthroughs, the story intensified – along with the public’s interest. In the role of grieving widow, Anagnostopoulos pandered to Greek fears: he wasn’t sure where the thieves were from, but he was convinced they were foreigners. Potential suspects were pulled out of police line-ups with the aviator deliberately suggesting Georgians or Albanians were behind the murder. Other props would be used to maintain the fiction that he was a loving family man who had fallen victim to heinous crime. Attending Crouch’s funeral, he mourned by the side of her grave, clutching the couple’s baby daughter, Lydia, for more than four hours. Weeks later, when it became clear that the doting father had in fact been the perpetrator who had placed the 11-month-old child next to her dead mother’s body, the backlash was instant. Following his shock confession, sympathy turned into shock and then revulsion. Across the country, Greeks felt hoodwinked, not only by Anagnostopoulos’ lies and hypocrisy, but by the knowledge that, like the police, they had been fooled by a consummate actor who had played on their deepest fears.",News/World news,Babis Anagnostopoulos: how a murderer fooled the world for months,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/babis-anagnostopoulos-caroline-crouch-murderer-fooled-world
5/17/2022,"Culture wars are “not just an ugly political phenomenon … they’re deeply dangerous”, Sayeeda Warsi has told the fifth annual Jo Cox memorial lecture at the University of Cambridge. The lecture was set up to memorialise the Labour MP who was shot and stabbed in a politically motivated murder in 2016. Cox was struck while campaigning in her Yorkshire constituency during the European referendum campaign, in which she supported remain. Speaking to a capacity audience at Pembroke College on “culture wars” and societal fault-lines, the former chair of the Conservative party said: “I’m increasingly of the view that culture wars are sapping our energies and stopping us from solving the real issues of the day. “A divided country may help win elections but it doesn’t win a nation,” Lady Warsi added. She recalled when, some years ago, Cox had reached across the political divide and suggested an event together. Describing Cox’s philosophy as in “stark contrast” to culture wars, she said Cox “achieved in 13 months in parliament what so many do not [at all]”. Cox gained a place at Pembroke College in the 1990s, where she studied human, social and political studies. The memorial lecture was held in the Old Library, where a portrait of Cox by the artist Clara Drummond was later revealed in the hall by her sister and MP, Kim Leadbeater. Her husband, two children and parents were in attendance. Combining her academic achievement with political experience, Cox was considered a rising star within the Labour party. In the Commons, she had established herself as a critic of the policy in Syria. She believed there was a lack of “moral compass” in British policy and described the approach as a “masterclass in how not to do foreign policy”. She also argued in favour of allowing more refugees into the UK. “Culture wars in the end are a struggle to defend who we are,” said Warsi. The lecture arrived at a time when much of the so-called “culture wars” was being inflamed by politicians, commentators and social media. Boris Johnson has previously come under fire for inflaming culture wars from his former race adviser, Samuel Kasumu, who resigned because of the Conservatives pursuing a “politics steeped in division” and warned of another Cox tragedy should the government continue. “There are some people in the government who feel like the right way to win is to pick a fight on the culture war and to exploit division,” Kasumu previously told the Guardian in an interview. “I worry about that. It seems like people have very short memories, and they’ve already forgotten Jo Cox.” In the lecture, Warsi said what defines a nation is “deeper than flags and fanfare” and that the focus should not be on correcting past injustices or the toppling of statues such as in Bristol. “If you have a statue [of a person] who is controversial,” Warsi said, “leave them there but have a clear indication of who that person is. “Let it stay, but let it stay honestly.” Warsi added that while the UK had not hit as dark a phase as the US, which has recently experienced a capital riot and attempts to overturn elections, she added: “Sadly where the US goes on culture wars, the UK often follows.” Cox’s killer, Thomas Mair, uttered the words “Britain first” and “keep Britain independent” as he carried out the attack. He was later given a life sentence for murder, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an offence, possession of a dagger and grievous bodily harm to a second victim. The unemployed gardener, then 52, was alleged to have accessed online sites about Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, the Waffen-SS, Israel, matricide and serial killers in the days before she was killed. Nazi memorabilia and far-right books were later discovered in his home. Mair was charged with Cox’s murder‬, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an offence, possession of a dagger and grievous bodily harm to a second victim, the passerby Bernard Carter-Kenny. Cox was 41 and the MP for Batley and Spen when she died, and is survived by her two children and husband. In response to her death, Pembroke College alumni and students raised funds for a Jo Cox scholarship. Warsi, a daughter of Pakistani immigrants, defected from the leave campaign in 2016, accusing it of “hate and xenophobia” just days before the referendum. In a 2016 tribute to Cox, Warsi said: “It takes a certain kind of Labour politician to convince the ex-chairman of the Conservative party to share a platform with her weeks before the general election, and to praise her for the work that she was doing. But that was Jo; working above the fray, across the political divide.” In 2021, the lecture was delivered by the former home secretary and chair of The Jo Cox Foundation, Jacqui Smith.",News/Politics,"Culture wars ‘deeply dangerous’, Warsi warns at Jo Cox event",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/16/culture-wars-deeply-dangerous-warsi-warns-at-jo-cox-event
5/17/2022,"Doctors from overseas working in the NHS are more likely to be suspended or struck off when they have no lawyer to represent them at a disciplinary hearing, new figures show. The findings have raised fresh questions about whether the General Medical Council (GMC) displays “systemic racial bias” in its treatment of foreign-born medics accused of wrongdoing. When doctors who graduated abroad do not have legal representation upon attending a tribunal hearing, more than four out of five (83%) end up being suspended from work or struck off from the UK medical register, GMC figures show. That is significantly higher than the 55% of suspended or struck off overseas medical graduates who had representation . The hearings fall under the responsibility of the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS), the GMC’s disciplinary arm. Similarly, while the MPTS panel decided that only 8% of those without representation should face “no impairment” of their medical practice, the figure was much higher – 27% – among those who did have a lawyer with them. In addition, many in the latter group received nothing more than a warning, in which doctors are told that their behaviour was below the acceptable standard. A total of 37% of UK doctors who trained abroad do not have legal representation when they attend an MPTS hearing, compared to 25% of doctors who qualified in the UK. The GMC figures, which cover the years 2018–21, were obtained by the Medical Protection Society (MPS), which represents doctors whose conduct has drawn complaints from members of the public, using freedom of information laws. Dame Jane Dacre, the president of the MPS, said: “The fact that so many doctors coming to work in the UK have no one to defend their interests, provide legal advice and guide them through what is a lengthy, stressful and complex regulatory process, is worrying. I am deeply concerned for them. “The difference in outcomes when an overseas graduate has legal representation at their tribunal is stark and shows just how essential it is. Those without are clearly greatly disadvantaged, coming out of the process facing significantly harsher sanctions which can so often be career-ending.” Dr Ramesh Mehta, the president of the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin, said many overseas-trained doctors are unaware that they are only covered by the NHS’s collective insurance policy for alleged medical negligence, and not for complaints about their personal behaviour. “It’s very unfair that these doctors aren’t properly informed and therefore aren’t properly represented”, because they have not joined a medical defence organisation, he added. Dr Jenny Vaughan, the chair of the Doctors’ Association (DAUK), said: “This research by the MPS shows the injustice of what is happening to overseas graduates who come to this country and provide a vital service for our patients. “As a country we cannot have it both ways. We should not expect our health service to be propped up by overseas graduates and then just let them face such serious consequences without proper support.” The GMC has pledged to eradicate “disproportionate complaints from employers about ethnic minority doctors”, after complaints that the disciplinary system was racist. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the chair of council at the British Medical Association, said that the GMC’s bias against ethnic minority doctors had been proven last year when the regulator was found to have discriminated against Dr Omer Karim, a cancer surgeon, on the grounds of his race. “It’s a tragedy to think that the NHS might already have lost talented professionals” because of the large number of foreign-trained doctors who have been struck off when they faced an MPTS hearing alone, added Nagpaul. The GMC said that any doctor who faces a hearing without legal representation is at risk of a negative outcome, regardless of where they are from. A spokesperson said: “Our own published peer-reviewed research shows that any doctor who doesn’t attend their hearing or have legal representation is more likely to receive more serious outcomes at hearings. That same research shows that tribunal outcomes are unrelated to whether doctors qualified in the UK or not. Non-attendance or lack of legal representation puts any doctor at a disadvantage.”",News/Society,Overseas-trained NHS doctors more likely to be struck off without lawyer at a disciplinary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/16/overseas-trained-nhs-doctors-more-likely-to-be-struck-off-without-lawyer-at-a-disciplinary
5/17/2022,"In MI5’s London headquarters there is a top secret grid, on which is ranked the top terrorist plots absorbing the attention and resources of the security services and police. While 15 years ago it was dominated by Islamist plotters, in recent years the most severe threats to the country’s national security feature people planning atrocities linked to extreme rightwing ideology. The official figures are sobering. They reveal that the United Kingdom faces twin threats of terrorist violence, from Islamists such as adherents of Islamic State, and from a far more disparate extremist far right, trying to trigger a race war to further their ideology. Since March 2017, counter-terrorism police and the intelligence services have stopped 32 plots they assess as aiming to cause mass casualties on British soil. Of these they assess 18 were Islamist related, and 12 were triggered by extreme rightwing terrorist ideology. The other two were linked to category known as left, anarchist or single-issue terrorism (LASIT). The last one to get through and kill was Darren Osborne, who drove a van into worshippers outside Finsbury Park mosque in north London in 2017, leaving one person dead. In his van was a note setting out his grievances. The investigation by police and MI5 discovered that he radicalised himself in a month, starting with mainstream material. His note talked about grooming gangs, and police believe the catalyst for Osborne’s descent into hate was seeing a BBC drama about a sexual abuse scandal involving Muslim men, screened on a Sunday evening. That issue about grooming gangs was then used in online extremist propaganda against Islam. Osbourne read internet propaganda from Tommy Robinson, the founder of the English Defence League and material from Britain First, another extremist hate group. The ratio of counter-terrorism investigations is still roughly six Islamist for every one from the extreme right wing, covering everything from plots to financing to propaganda. In March, assistant commissioner Matt Jukes, head of counter-terrorism, said that 19 out of 20 children who were arrested in the previous 12 months for terrorism offences were linked to an extreme rightwing ideology. Those falling for rightwing hate and then breaking terrorism laws were younger than those falling for Islamist hate, with techniques including online content based on violent video games shaped to indoctrinate them. Jukes said that 41% of counter-terrorism arrests in 2021 were of extreme rightwing suspects. Although the death toll in the UK from the extreme right wing has numbered single victims so far, including the assassination of Jo Cox MP in 2016, mass murders in Christchurch and now Buffalo give the lie to any notion the ideology is any less effective at delivering carnage. The government review of Prevent was hoped to refresh and save it. The national security imperative was to find a way of diverting recruits to terrorism, before it was too late. William Shawcross’s appointment as chair of the review was greeted by a boycott from human rights group and Muslim organisations because of his past comments. But his appointment was also feared by some in counter-terrorism over concerns his findings would be so extreme they would kill what credibility Prevent had left, if they were enacted.",News/UK news,Terrorism in the UK: the rising threat of far right extremists,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/terrorism-in-the-uk-the-rising-threat-of-far-right-extremists
