2/24/2022,"Ukraine's top diplomat issued a grave warning to the United Nations on Wednesday. Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said full-blown war with Russia will be ""the end of the world order."" He urged the UN and the international community to impose ""swift, concrete, and resolute actions."" Ukraine's foreign minister told the United Nations on Wednesday that a full-blown war with Russia would spell the ""end of the world order."" ""The beginning of a large-scale war in Ukraine will be the end of the world order as we know it,"" Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told the UN General Assembly in New York and later shared on Ukraine's government website. He added: ""If Russia does not get a severe, swift and decisive response now, this will mean a total bankruptcy of the international security system and international institutions which are tasked with maintaining the global security order."" Kuleba urged both the UN and the international community at-large to impose ""swift, concrete, and resolute actions"" as a response to the latest Russian aggression. Russia on Monday recognized two regions in eastern Ukraine governed by Kremlin-backed separatists as independent states, shortly before President Vladimir Putin ordered troops across his borders and into Ukraine. The move has triggered expansive sanctions from the US, UK, European Union, and other nations, targeting banks, Russian lawmakers and elites, and the country's finances. Kuleba said the world is at a ""critical juncture"" in its history, and called the ongoing situation Europe's ""largest security crisis"" since World War II. He said the UN needs to take ""concrete actions to stop the Russian machine of war"" before a ""bloody"" conflict ensues. ""I do not want this,"" he said. ""Ukraine does not want this. The world does not want this."" President Joe Biden has previously said that US troops won't send to Ukraine — which is not a NATO ally — but that the US and its allies will ""defend every inch of NATO territory."" Earlier on Wednesday, Kuleba wrote on Twitter that countries should impose more sanctions on Russia and Putin. ""Hit more. Hit more. Hit now,"" he wrote. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky issued a similar plea on Wednesday, calling on the international community to deliver a ""harsh"" response to Russia's actions.

In fact, the entire universe could be a hologram. At least, that’s one part of the idea behind a recent study published in the journal PRX Quantum. The study is a deeper look at what’s inside a black hole. It’s also an attempt to better understand the idea of holographic duality. Holographic duality is a mathematical conjecture that attempts to connect theories of particles and their interactions and the theory of gravity. It’s an interesting idea, even if it sounds a little out there.

Essentially, holographic duality posits that the theory of gravity and the theory of particles are equivalent. At least, mathematically. Thus, what happens mathematically in the theory of gravity also happens in the theory of particles. For the most part, both of these theories describe different dimensions. However, gravity describes three dimensions, whereas particle theory consists of only two dimensions. The researchers hoped that probing this idea could help them understand what’s inside a black hole. Enrico Rinaldi, a research scientist at the University of Michigan, focused on these two theories in the new study. “In Einstein’s General Relativity theory, there are no particles—there’s just space-time. And in the Standard Model of particle physics, there’s no gravity, there’s just particles,” he says. “Connecting the two different theories is a longstanding issue in physics—something people have been trying to do since the last century.” By connecting these two theories, and using quantum matrix models, Rinaldi and the other members of the study were able to probe holographic duality. The idea was to combine what we know about particle theory and what we know about the theory of gravity. To start, they used simply matrix models made up of blocks of numbers. It’s a standard framework used in quantum computers where particle theory is represented by one-dimensional strings. These usually help researchers find the ground state, which Rinaldi says is important because it lets you create things from it. Using the models that they did, the researchers were able to describe what the gravity inside a black hole looks like. Yes and no. When you think hologram, you probably think of holographic communicators from science fiction movies like Star Wars. In this case, though, what Rinaldi and his co-authors are referring to is the way the inside of a black hole meets with the outside. Because the inside of a black hole works off the theory of gravity, it is represented in 3D space as space-time moves through it. However, on the surface, the black hole looks two-dimensional. This gives it a holographic look because we do not see it as a 3D object. This is because the theory of particles does not work in three dimensions. As such, some believe that the rest of the universe may work similarly. However, there is no current proof to suggest that is actually the case. Click here to read the full article.

2/24/2022,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas Gov. Greg Abbott lashed out Wednesday at the local prosecutor in his state's capital, floating the possibility of clemency to 19 Austin police officers indicted for tactics used during 2020 demonstrations against racial injustice. Abbott, a Republican, alluded to the local police union's assertion that charging the officers was a “political sham” in his first public statement on the indictments, including against two officers involved in injury cases that the city has offered to pay millions of dollars to settle. “In Austin, law enforcement officers defended the state Capitol from criminal assault, protected the Austin Police Department headquarters from being overrun, cleared the interstate from being shut down, and disrupted criminal activity in areas across the city,” Abbott said. “Many officers were physically attacked while protecting Austin. Those officers should be praised for their efforts, not prosecuted.” The governor's statement did not mention demonstrators who were hurt, including some critically. Nelson Linder, president of the Austin NAACP, said the governor’s announcement seemed premature and sent the wrong message on police brutality. “I think it shows an imbalance in the city when it comes to public safety,” Linder said. “As a Black person and Brown person and for everyone else as well, we ought to be very concerned about the politicization of police misconduct,” Linder said. Travis County District Attorney Jose Garza’s campaign promised to take a tougher stance on police accountability, but he has denied that the charges are driven by politics. In a statement Wednesday, Garza's office said ""no one is above the law"" and that the investigation into the matter continues. “In these cases, Austin police officers indiscriminately fired deadly weapons into crowds of people,” the statement said. ""Safety and accountability are our priority, not political talking points.” Austin, like many cities throughout the U.S., saw massive protests following the killing of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis. But 19 indictments ranks among the most charges on a single police department in the nation over officers actions during the widespread protests. Those methods led to the resignation or ouster of several police chiefs across the country. The indictments against the Austin officers were made public Tuesday by Garza's office after prosecutors announced last week  that a grand jury had decided the officers should face first-degree felonies. Grand juries do their work in private. All of the officers are charged with aggravated assault by a public servant over the injuries of a total of 10 people. That came days after Austin City Council members voted to approve a total of $10 million in settlements for two people injured by police in the protests. Two officers are charged in the shooting of Justin Howell, a then-20-year-old college student who police said was shot in the head with a bean bag round unintentionally, leading to a skull fracture and brain damage. One of those officers is also accused of shooting Anthony Evans, whose injuries required extensive surgery in his jaw. If both settlements are accepted, Howell will receive $8 million from the city of Austin — one of the largest settlements in cases connected to late May 2020 protests — while Evans will receive $2 million. Attorneys Douglas O’Connell and Ken Ervin, who represent eight of the indicted officers, said that the police department’s internal affairs division investigated their clients and cleared them of wrongdoing in the same actions for which they’re now criminally charged. ___ Coronado is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.
