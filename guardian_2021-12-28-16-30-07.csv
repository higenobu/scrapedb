12/28/2021,"The Indian government has blocked Mother Teresa’s charity from receiving funds from abroad, just days after it faced a police investigation for “hurting religious sentiments of Hindus” amid rising intolerance towards Christians in India. The Missionaries of Charity, which was started by Mother Teresa in 1950 and runs a network of shelters across India led by nuns to help the poor, was denied the licence to continue to receive funds from abroad, cutting the charity off from vital resources.  The home ministry, which made the decision on Christmas Day, said it had come across “adverse inputs” when considering the application. The rejection of the application comes less than two weeks after Hindu hardliners accused the charity of carrying out forced conversions of Hindus to Christianity in a home for girls it runs in Vadodara in the state of Gujarat. The accusations, which the charity fiercely denies, were that the charity was “luring” poor young Hindu women into becoming Christian by forcing them to read Christian texts and take part in Christian prayer. “The institution has been involved in activities to hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus intentionally and with bitterness,” a report filed to the police alleged. “The girls inside the Home for Girls are being lured to adopt Christianity by making them wear the cross around their neck and also placing the Bible on the table of the storeroom used by the girls, in order to compel them to read the Bible … It is an attempted crime to force religious conversion upon the girls.” A spokesperson for the Missionaries of Charity rejected all the allegations as unfounded. “We have not converted anyone or forced anyone to marry into Christian faith,” he said. The accusation come amid a wave of anti-Christian intolerance and violence that has been spreading across India, with rightwing Hindu nationalist groups accusing Christians of forcing Hindus to convert against their will, or through bribes. Christian pastors have been attacked and church services violently disrupted in recent months as anti-Christian hysteria has grown, and over Christmas there was an unprecedented spate of attacks against the Christian community, including the vandalising of a statue of Jesus Christ. The refusal by the government, which is ruled by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), to grant a new licence to Mother Teresa’s charity has been seen by many as indicative of a growing hostility towards Christian organisations operating in India. In recent years, the BJP government, led by the prime minister, Narendra Modi, has put a tight rein on NGOs receiving foreign funding, particularly those that have been critical of the government, and both Greenpeace and Amnesty International are among those who have had their accounts frozen by the government. In a statement on Monday, the Missionaries of Charity confirmed that its renewal application had been denied, and that it would not operate any foreign funding accounts “until the matter is resolved”.",News/News,India bans Mother Teresa charity from receiving funds from abroad,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/dec/28/india-bans-mother-teresa-charity-from-receiving-funds-from-abroad
12/28/2021,"From the moment Amanda Gorman started to speak at President Biden’s inauguration, on 20 January, the effect was spellbinding. A graceful young woman in a brilliant yellow suit, speaking to millions – she seemed like sunshine itself, bathing the audience in her light. That performance of her poem, The Hill We Climb, had star quality – and her words, pressing for national unity and reconciliation, soared. The sentiments might not have been out of the ordinary but their delivery was. “The new dawn blooms as we free it./For there is always light,/ If only we’re brave enough to see it./If only we’re brave enough to be it.” Gorman is brave enough to be it. And to be able to perform at a political gathering and at once lift up and move an audience in this way is rare – the legacy of Martin Luther King needs no labouring. She is now celebrated as a US national youth poet laureate and could even be described as the country’s dazzling new secular preacher. For, as her poem Cordage, or Atonement, puts it: “Poetry is its own prayer,/The closest words come to will.”  I found it difficult, reading Call Us What We Carry, to separate the poetry from the remembered image of that inauguration recital. Fending for themselves on the page, some of the poems appear incomplete – like unaccompanied minors, waiting for their guardian’s return. They ask to be read aloud. The collection is ardent, committed but uneven. Gorman’s hallmark is also, at times, her weakness: she cannot resist words that echo one another. “Shall this leave us bitter? Or better?” (The Shallows); or “As we become more akin/To kin,” (Back to the Past) or “This book is awake. This book is a wake.” (Ship’s Manifest). When she pulls it off, it is musical: there is a sense of exalted wordplay – sounds as soulmates. But as often, the echo is empty and does not deliver enough meaning. Having said this, she nails a political point in describing the US’s early Covid days, in At First, as “Unprecedented & unpresidented.” Gorman makes a virtue of telling rather than showing. The poems are emotionally primed and have an aphoristic momentum. And while some images do not quite come off (“Hope is the soft bird/We send across the sea”), the emotion always does (“We have lost too much to lose”) and one is grateful for her uncompromising take on the tragedy of the pandemic and the wrongness of living apart. Elsewhere, poems such as Fury & Faith are powerful reiterations of black lives mattering, peaceful rallying cries. She makes sure you know where she is coming from (sometimes in the most profound sense – as a descendant of slaves). History is her spur: she enterprisingly takes the testimony of Roy Underwood Plummer (1896-1966) and uses his soldier’s journal to perform historical ventriloquy. In her vigilant, truthful poems about Covid, it is as if she were taking the temperature of the times (feverish, often courageous, sometimes sadly lacking a pulse) while also not neglecting to plunder the past to reflect upon other viruses that might inform our experience (she alludes to the famous Aids quilt and has extensively researched Spanish flu). And it is striking how often the image of a ship appears (we were, after all, in our separate ships metaphorically during lockdown). On the Good Ship Gorman there is never any doubting the shining intentions of the skipper. She is, throughout, playfully experimental. One poem is shaped as a supine whale, another an American flag and there is a poem in the shape of a face mask that ends with the line: “Who were we beneath our mask./Who are we now that it is trashed.” In Fugue, she exults “Even now handshakes & hugs are like gifts”. But she is right in The Unordinary World to express uncertainty: “The worst is over/Depending on who you ask”. For the curious thing, beyond Gorman’s control, is that many poems already seem past their sell-by – or (to play her game) their celebrate-by – date. The masks have not, after all, been trashed and there will be much more for this extraordinary woman to write.  Call Us What We Carry by Amanda Gorman is published by Chatto (£14.99).

12/28/2021,"My first time at rock bottom came early. I was an infant when my mum fled with me and my brother to a refuge, to escape violence at home. This period of fear was brief, but it left an indelible mark. The chaos and trauma from these years manifested in my flailing limbs during desperate temper tantrums, in which my mum would hear every epithet I could think of while her whole bookcase crashed down our stairs. For as long as I can remember, I have been told that there is something wrong with me, that I am different, naughty, need help; and that chemicals would make me better, make me good. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is the medicalised term for my condition, which proved incompatible with mainstream schools, where pirouetting in maths class like a drunk gymnast was not appreciated.  Academia and I went together like shards of glass on toast. My maths teachers assumed I had dyscalculia, my English teachers dyslexia. One teacher – let’s call him Mr X – remarked that my grasp of grammar was “limp-wristed in the extreme”. (Mr X, if you are reading this, I started this sentence with a bracket, just for you – and now I am not going to close it. I thought getting expelled from every mainstream school was my rock bottom, but I continued to fall. I was thrown out of my foster home and went to a children’s home, where I got my first taste of a police cell. A few kids had decided we should disassemble our wardrobes and launch them down the stairs because the staff, trying to prise us away from the telly after curfew, had turned off the electricity. Kids’ homes in the 90s felt more like prepping units for prison. Bad behaviour meant being put “on basics”: no TV, stereo, sweets or pocket money. But those threats held no sway that evening. The staff, feeling they had lost control, dialled 999. We were twisted up and locked up. But our mischief nights only escalated. I visited the cells a few more times, earning a criminal record before I was 16. It is little surprise that children in care are far more likely to become criminalised than other children. But I still had further to fall. I spent most of my early adulthood unemployed. I was homeless before I turned 21. The library brought me a reprieve: I became an autodidact and eventually encountered real didacts when I made it to university at 23. Finally, I thought, I had escaped the turmoil of my past, but it caught up with me. I had lived on my own since I was 17, but I had never learned – or been taught – to look after myself properly. Over the three years at university, I racked up thousands of pounds of arrears, gained tens of pounds in weight and became a drink-sodden recluse. It ended with me graduating while living in an Emmaus community for homeless people. I have thought long and hard about how I bounced back from all this. If I am honest, I don’t know. In a way, it doesn’t matter. What matters more is that I am a walking, talking anomaly. How many people like me write for national newspapers, or write books? We all have a lowest point, but many people can latch on to loved ones and resurface. Others fall too far to return undamaged. Almost everyone I lived with through the care system has been in and out of prison, strung out, off the map; some are dead. We should judge a civilised society by how it treats its most vulnerable citizens – and the British state is an appalling parent. The children in its charge are more likely to be criminalised and exploited than other children; teenage pregnancies occur at a higher rate, as do substance dependency and mental illness. Then, when the state’s kids reach 18, they are expected to fend for themselves entirely. It should be no surprise that so many end up destitute, as I did. I could write about how picking up a pen and expressing myself gave me purpose – and it did. But, in reality, I was just lucky. And it shouldn’t be good fortune when a looked-after child makes it in our society. The kids I grew up with were damaged by difficult lives, but they were sharp, resilient and funny. Who knows what they could have become if the government had taken its parental role seriously? If we want the reason looked-after children can thrive to be down to more than chance, we must try harder – and care more. Only then will more people with stories like mine make it back from their rock bottom.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"How did I survive care and prison?

12/28/2021,"Every winter, thousands of grey seals give birth on the beaches near Winterton-on-Sea. By late November this year, the Friends of Horsey Seals had already counted 1,172 pups, with many more on the way. The Friends have looked after the growing colony since 2012, to make sure visitors can watch safely without disturbing the wildlife. I’m alarmed that one fluffy white pup seems to be bleeding, until a warden points out the red streak is the umbilical cord. The scene in front of me, teeming with life, is one of Britain’s great natural spectacles.  Winterton-on-Sea is a 45-minute ride on Coastal Clipper bus 1 from Great Yarmouth, which has smart, hourly trains through the marshy Broads from Norwich. I’ve spent much of the past decade exploring East Anglia and thought I knew what to expect from a minibreak on the coast near Yarmouth. Turns out there’s plenty I don’t know: about lichen, about the circus, and seals. I talk to several seal wardens, all devoted, knowledgable, and keen to emphasise that people should keep off the beach. A raised flipper, which looks like a cheerful wave, actually means stay away. I’m sleeping in an old red-brick barn at Mill Farm, which is 15 minutes’ walk from the beach. There are four big bedrooms round an even bigger living room with sofas, TV, log-burning stove and piles of boardgames. There’s a separate games barn with pool and ping pong tables. And several green features, from a biomass boiler to a guest allotment. The welcome hamper includes juice from the farm’s apples. Environmentalists Emma and Neil Punchard, who converted this Eco Barn, have created an orchard, wildlife pond and butterfly-magnet paddocks around it, and planted 1,800 native hedgerow shrubs to line the permissive path that keeps walkers safely off the road from the village and nearby bus stop. In April, they’re opening a new Grain Barn that sleeps four. The pink-footed geese first fly over while I’m having breakfast the next day. Their calls alert me, and I run to the door to see a classic spear-shaped line of geese. Attracted to Norfolk partly by sugar beet tops left in the fields after harvesting, overwintering pink-foots have become a local phenomenon. The nearby Berney Marshes sees as many as 15,000 of them gathering between October and March each year, migrating from their summer breeding grounds in Iceland and Greenland. One of the area’s most interesting car-free trips is to these remote, roadless marshes, which I explored with friends very soon after Berney Arms railway station reopened in February 2020. Accessible only by train, boat or on foot along the river (and bank) from Yarmouth, the black tower of the Berney Arms wind pump is the tallest in the Broads. Around it, miles of water and grass stretch out to a distant horizon, home to wild geese, galloping hares and muntjac deer. On Sundays, with buses from Winterton into Yarmouth and trains onward from there, you can follow an isolated loop through the windmill-studded landscape. You’ll need to keep an eye on train times and bring weatherproof kit and refreshments. I spend this morning exploring Winterton and the neighbouring dunes, marvelling at the patchwork of ferns, fungi and mosses. There are dozens of different types of lichen, including one that has pale branches like antlers and another that looks like lots of tiny green elfin goblets. I look them up later and find they are reindeer lichen and pixie cup lichen. There’s a tall white lighthouse above the dunes and colourful thatched roundhouses that are part of Hermanus holiday park. Three silver, 70s Airstream caravans nearby belong to Norfolk’s Edge, a new beach cafe that opened last July. Alex Clare, former head chef at the Ingham Swan, serves up seasonal brioches or tubs of shellfish bisque here by day, and provides fine dining in private houses in the evening. I stop for a bagel, then follow the coast path northwards. The seal colony stretches seven miles from Winterton to Waxham. Patches of bright red on distant sand are placentas, soon food for scavenging seagulls. There are seals surfing the waves, lolloping over the beach, or moaning to each other. It’s almost a relief to leave the unsettlingly human wailing and turn inland to loop back to Mill Farm. I combine routes 2 and 3 from the booklet of local walks supplied in the barn and relax to the sound of birdsong and rustling reeds. Marsh harriers fly silently over fields of squawking pheasants. The highlight is ruined St Mary’s church at East Somerton. Arched windows, curtained with ivy, surround a large oak growing out of the roofless nave. It’s raining steadily next morning, so I catch the bus into Yarmouth for some weatherproof sightseeing. I kick off with coffee and a lemony, sugar-crusted bolo de arroz (rice muffin) at Duarte’s cafe, where everyone else is drinking espresso and speaking Portuguese. The seafront is two minutes away, but it’s still drizzling, so I head for Time and Tide museum. Alongside a temporary exhibition of art from Ladybird books (until 23 January), this engaging museum celebrates the town’s history and herring industry in an old Victorian fish-curing factory (£6.70). Even through my face mask, I can smell the lingering woodsmoke in the well-worn wooden floors and old brick walls. The reconstruction of one of the town’s old rows (narrow streets) comes complete with a soundscape of babies crying, dogs barking and kipper-sellers shouting. Like any regional museum, it’s more interesting if you know the area a little. There are bronze buckles from the Roman fort at Caister-on-Sea, whose ruins I saw from the bus window on the way here, and an 1819 painting by George Vincent of the local seafront, complete with Dutch traders, bathing machines and Yarmouth’s towering monument to Norfolk-born Nelson. Round the corner on Yarmouth’s South Quay, a Georgian merchant’s house, which once housed a Nelson museum, reopened in May as the new Yare art gallery (free). The big, light-filled rooms are ideal for bold, colourful exhibitions, like the current celebration of the circus (until 13 January). There’s bunting above the stairs, distorting mirrors scattered through the galleries, and a giant inflatable pink elephant in the courtyard. Peter Jay, whose band toured with the Beatles, has owned Yarmouth’s Hippodrome Circus since 1979 and lent pictures and costumes from his collection. A film on the top floor narrated by Jay’s son Jack, the current ringmaster, shows how the 120-year-old building was restored; its round stage sinks to become a swimming pool for the water show. Intrigued, I walk 10 minutes to the art nouveau Hippodrome, where this year’s Christmas Spectacular runs until 9 January (from £13/£22 for kids/adults). The quirky 1903 cafe, full of mismatched furniture and circus memorabilia, opened earlier this year. The gold curtains are still drawn this morning, and I stroll along the sand for a bowl of clam chowder (£6.90) at the Beach Hut, my favourite Yarmouth cafe. The greyish-brown North Sea lies ahead, beyond young, grassy dunes. The Venetian Waterways, next door to the cafe, are a network of winding canals, bridges and little thatched shelters between neat borders of Russian sage and rosemary. The gardens were first laid out in the 1920s, part of a scheme to provide work for 300 unemployed men, and reopened in spring 2019 after a £1.7m restoration. The weather has cleared and scraps of rainbow float above the Britannia pier. After lunch, I hike past the airy Minster and five miles out of town to third-century Burgh (pronounced Burra) Castle, one of Britain’s best-preserved Roman ruins. Known to the Romans as Gariannonum, this was one of nine forts defending the estuaries of the Saxon Shore against seafaring raiders. Its flint walls stand up to 4½ metres high and Time and Tide has a Roman horseman’s helmet that was found there. I’m following the start of the Angles Way, a long-distance route that leads from Yarmouth, along the winding River Waveney and through the Broads, to wild Knettishall Heath in the Suffolk Breckland. Here, the route runs beside Breydon Water, a big, tidal stretch of water whose muddy banks attract thousands of waterbirds in winter. The tide is high now, leaving them little room to forage, but there are ducks and lapwings near the flood wall. This area was below sea level when the Romans arrived and built their coastal fort. The sun is already sinking as I reach a boardwalk between reedbeds and climb the steps to Burgh Castle. A chill wind ripples over the reeds and river. I walk past a round-towered church and along the lane to warm up in the Queens Head pub. Bus 5 goes back to Yarmouth every hour until teatime from the stop outside. As I wait, the pink-footed geese fly overhead again, calling to each other as they circle the ruins and head out across the twilit marsh.  Accommodation was provided by Mill Farm Eco Barn, which sleeps eight (three nights from £796 or from £325 for the two-person Hay Barn, millfarm-ecobarn.co.uk/).

12/28/2021,"Against the backdrop of Dunkirk’s busy port with its cranes and smoke, a collapsed, grey rubber dinghy lies on the shore, abandoned and washed in by the tide. It is one of the many haunting signs of the thousands of desperate people who have attempted to cross the Channel from northern France.  Nearby lies a red lifejacket and a shoe, half-filled with sand. The vessel bears the name MaRe Boote, a German firm based in the small western Rhineland town of Werne, about 400 miles from Calais. According to German police, at least 24 MaRe boats have been used by migrants to make the perilous journey. In a compound in Dover, where boats seized after being used to carry people from France are stored, there are dozens of dinghies of the same or similar model. According to British and French authorities, smugglers buy them in Germany, ship them to France, then transport them to the beach a few hours before departure. The Guardian has traced the journey of a number of different types of dinghies used by the people smugglers, most of which are produced thousands of miles from Dover in China, where they are generally ordered by smugglers over the internet to be delivered to the main migration routes to Europe. “Most of the dinghies, about 11 metres long, are designed to carry safely a maximum of 15 people. The smugglers push them into the vastness of the ocean even with 50 people on board,” said Salvatore Vella, chief prosecutor of Agrigento, Sicily, who has led the majority of investigations against smugglers operating in Libya. “The risk for passengers aboard these rafts is very high,” Vella added. “They are among the main causes of death at sea for asylum seekers, because it is difficult for these boats to reach their destination if they are not rescued. To cut costs, smugglers buy low-quality, inflatable boats, with prices ranging between $500 [£377] and $2,000.” A MaRe Boote dinghy, of the type found at Dunkirk, can be bought for about £2,000. There is no suggestion that the Mare Boats are substandard for normal use, or that they market their boats to people smugglers. In the past, crossings were attempted in old fishing boats, barges and wooden and glass fibre boats, which smugglers had bought from Libyan, Turkish, Tunisian and Egyptian fishers. However, since the peak of the migrant crisis in 2015, the European military missions to combat illegal immigration have begun to destroy these boats, with the aim of preventing them from being reused for people-smuggling. As a result, across the main sea routes, from the central Mediterranean to Turkey and from the Canaries to the coast of Dover, the inflatable dinghy has become the most-used type of vessel to reach Europe. Some dinghies, built with poor materials, are prone to deflate after just a few hours of navigation. Gradually, all their air chambers can collapse, even when the boat is stationary in a calm sea. Even the more expensive and better made German-sold models are unsuited to a Channel crossing when overloaded with dozens of people. Although the Channel route may seem more accessible than the Mediterranean, in reality it is one of the most lethal passages. At its narrowest point – about 21 miles across – the Channel is one of the busiest seaways in the world, with a constant traffic of cargo and fishing vessels, passenger ferries, yachts and coastguard boats. Carrying no lights and no technology to broadcast their own location or monitor the positions of other vessels, the rafts grope in the dark, virtually invisible to other ships. Onboard for emergencies, passengers only have a bike pump in case of deflation, and plastic bottles for bailing out water. Last month 27 people, most of them Iraqi Kurds, died when their boat sank in darkness in the Channel. The two survivors said the dinghy began to deflate about three-and-a-half hours after they set off from a beach near Dunkirk. Those onboard tried to keep the dinghy afloat but their pump broke, the survivors said, and the dinghy eventually flipped over. The survivors claim they had reached British waters by this point and rang the UK calling for help – unsuccessfully. Eleven hours later, French fishers spotted bodies in the water. “Costs for traffickers have dropped significantly with the use of rubber boats,” Vella said. “They can also be navigated by inexperienced men, chosen from among the migrants themselves. Plus, they’re easy to find. They can even be ordered on the web, in Asian markets.” For many years the Chinese online shopping platform Alibaba.com offered inflatable boats for sale under the tag “refugee boat” or “migrant boat”. A sales advert offered buyers a “high-quality refugee boat” for $800 to $1,100, for vessels made of plywood, aluminium and PVC that could carry up to 30 passengers and with lifejackets as “optional equipment”. “The boat has a good anti-sinking capacity. When it is loaded to capacity (even if the boat is fully filled with water), it can still float,” read one of the ads seen by the Guardian. After complaints from the EU, Alibaba.com said it would no longer “tolerate” sellers using its platform for this purpose. Since then, it says, most references to “refugee boats” and “migrant boats” have been removed from its platform. But a few weeks ago the Guardian found that links that contain “refugee boat”, “high quality refugee boat” and “inflatable migrant boat” were still valid on the e-commerce giant’s English-language website, even though most of the products listed under those pages no longer call themselves as such. There was at least one advertisement that reads: “GTS800 15 People, Inflatable Migrant Boat, 6.5 metres long, with a 60cm diameter tube”. The supplier is a Qingdao-based company called Goethe. A sales representative contacted by the Guardian said that 70% to 80% of the company’s sales had been to Europe this year – mostly to Germany and Greece. She said she was aware a Turkish customer had bought a boat for refugees a few years ago, but insisted this was “no longer happening” because of a Turkish government crackdown. “We manufacture thousands of boats every year, with some 100 different models,” she said. “Inside China, [these] boats are made mainly in the Shandong and Guangdong provinces.” But when asked about the “migrant boat” advertised on Alibaba.com, she said: “This is only a gimmick. It doesn’t mean very much.” She refused to disclose any details of Goethe’s clients, citing “corporate secret”. Alibaba has since removed the pages found by the Guardian. The Hangzhou-based company insists that it “will not tolerate those who seek to profit from this crisis”. “We are constantly engaged in efforts to ensure sellers on our platforms list products in an appropriate manner and in compliance with our policies,” it says in a statement to the Guardian. A leaked EU-restricted document, written in 2016 by the officers of Operation Sophia, the EU’s mission to crack down on illegal people-smuggling routes across the Mediterranean, confirmed that Libya-based smugglers were buying dinghies made in China and shipping them to north Africa via Malta. The document cited an interception of about 20 packaged rubber boats “imported from China and transported to Malta and Turkey, in a container destined for Misrata, Libya”. As there were no legal grounds for holding such shipments, the boats were released. Vella said vessels used to take people to Greece are delivered to Turkey. Those that set off from Libya are sent to Malta or Turkish ports, from where they are shipped as cargo to Libya. The inflatables that cross the Channel are delivered to the heart of Europe, he said. A report last month from the PAF border police (Police aux Frontières) found that “boats that come from China and are able to carry up to 60 migrants are stocked abroad, mainly in Germany”. Marvin Reuter, the owner of MaRe Boote, the German firm whose logo has repeatedly appeared on some rubber dinghies attempting to cross the Channel, agreed to speak to the Guardian. The firm’s website says: “We build exceptional inflatables. High quality, individual, sporty, fast and uncompromisingly good.” Reuter said he felt “frustrated” after German police informed him that his inflatable boats, which cost about £2,000 each, were used by migrants to attempt the crossing from France to the UK. “I feel horrible about what these bad guys do with my boats,” he said. Reuter said the customers who bought the inflatables, which are manufactured in China, did so “legally”, and took them away in a car, like everyone else. Like other dinghy firms in Europe, Reuter said he was not able to determine if customers intended to use the vessels to transport people. “The problem is that customers who bought these vessels may have sold them to the bad guys.” Some smuggling gangs appear to be continuing to buy direct from China. Olivier Cahn, professor of criminal law at CY Cergy Paris University, said these included a well-organised criminal gang made up of Iraqi Kurds and operating from Calais. The gang was partially dismantled in November, with several arrests, after 27 people drowned. The smugglers used dinghies ordered in China and shipped to Turkey, Cahn said. The vessels were then transported via the Balkans to Germany, where they were “unbundled” and handed over to teams of smugglers operating in Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Normandy. Refugees the Guardian spoke to last month in a freezing camp on the outskirts of Dunkirk said smugglers charged €3,000 (£2,500) per person for the Channel crossing. In 2019, crossings intercepted by law enforcement agencies included an average of 12 individuals per boat; in 2021, this number rose to 27. As the fees charged by criminal organisations are high, small “self-employed” groups are trying their luck, Cahn said. They expose themselves to the dangers of the sea on board makeshift dinghies, reinforced with sections of PVC attached with marine duct tape, or sheets of plywood fixed with screws. Several large distribution companies in northern France, such as the sport equipment retailer Decathlon, no longer sell dinghies or canoes, to prevent migrants from attempting to use them to cross to England. The rubber boats – after a journey of 6,000 miles, passing from the containers of cargo ships to the hubs of international airports, to the warehouses of European shops, from the hands of smugglers who fill them with people – end up on the beaches of northern France and southern England, along with shoes and clothing. The footwear and garments belong to men, women and children, whose fates, much of the time, remain unknown.",News/UK news,"‘Good anti-sinking capacity, lifejacket optional’: journey of a ‘refugee boat’",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/28/good-anti-sinking-capacity-lifejacket-optional-journey-of-a-refugee-boat
12/28/2021,"About 12,000 Afghan refugees will begin 2022 in UK hotels as the government struggles to persuade enough councils to find permanent homes for the new arrivals, the Guardian has learned. Of the 16,500 people airlifted from Afghanistan to the UK since August, “over 4,000 individuals have either moved into a settled home or are in the process of being moved or matched to a suitable home”, according to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).  The rest wait eagerly for news of where they will begin to rebuild their lives, though many say their hearts remain in Afghanistan, where they hope to return one day. They will not be evenly distributed across the UK after the government decided not to force local authorities to rehouse the refugees. More than 300 local authorities in the UK have stepped up to offer permanent accommodation, according to a Home Office spokesperson. According to the most recent figures, by the end of September, councils in Yorkshire and the Humber had welcomed 213 of the 770 Afghans resettled across the UK this year. Ninety-two of those were in Bradford, compared with just 24 across all the London councils. After Bradford, Edinburgh was the city to have resettled the most Afghans this year: 67. As of 7 December, about 7,500 people had been relocated to the UK under the Afghan relocations and assistance policy (Arap), which offered sanctuary to any current or former UK government employees who faced intimidation or a threat to their life. Operation Pitting, the Afghan airlift in August, brought 15,000 people to the UK. Since the evacuation, a further 1,500 people have followed. More than 12,000 Afghan evacuees remained in bridging accommodation as of 22 December, according to sources at both the DWP and Home Office. At least 4,000 of those are in London, according to London Councils, the local government association for Greater London. London council officials described the situation in hotels as “chaos” and expressed particular concern about the unsuitability of hotels in the long term to accommodate the large number of children currently living in them. Many now have community ties with London, children have started school and as time goes by it will be harder to uproot them and move them to a different part of the country where there is a greater supply of affordable accommodation. While the government made housing grants available for the new arrivals, none of the Afghans who arrived in the UK after 31 August are eligible for these grants. The vast majority of Afghan refugees stuck in hotels are not able to work yet because they do not have permanent addresses and cannot guarantee to an employer that they will not be shipped across the country with minimal notice. Benafsha Yaqoobi, a visually impaired commissioner at the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, who has been living in a four-star central London hotel since August, said the local council had advised some Afghans that they could not work while they were stuck in the hotels. Some guests were “very excited” to have found jobs, only to be told they could not take them, she said, because it was not known where they would be relocated, they could end up in Scotland. Living in a hotel for so long was hard, said Yaqoobi, who is sharing a room with her husband, Mehdi Salami, who is also visually impaired. “For me, for all Afghan people who are here, it’s very difficult, especially with Covid increasing these days. In a hotel and living like this, it’s not easy.” When the Guardian spoke to Yaqoobi in September, she pleaded for world leaders to help more disabled people flee Afghanistan. She continues to be very worried about the disabled children she used to help with her charity, the Rahyab Organisation, who she had to leave behind, and hopes to begin studying for a PhD. Three months on, she has struck up a friendship with Mozghan Shaban, a DWP employee originally from Afghanistan, who spent several weeks going from hotel to hotel in London helping the new arrivals apply for universal credit. The DWP had processed more than 3,000 claims for universal credit, as of 3 December, covering more than 4,700 people. The government legislated to exempt those arriving under the Afghan relocation and resettlement schemes from the usual residency tests which restrict access to certain benefits upon arrival in the UK. Shaban, whose family fled Afghanistan in the late 1990s, can speak Farsi, one of the main Afghan languages, and was well placed to help the new arrivals navigate British bureaucracy. She is well known around the hotels for her jokes, reassuring the guests that they do not need to fear their new country – “the worst you’ll get is rain”. She describes herself as a “therapist, mum, sister” who helps them understand British customs and culture and particularly gender roles. “Some of the families who have come here are very, very traditional,” she said. “It’s quite customary for a girl or woman to stand up and offer her seat to, say, her brother or her father. That’s just a thing that we do out of respect, because in Afghanistan men are treated as gods and women, not so much.” She preempts cultural misunderstandings too: “I had to explain to people that if they go out on the street, don’t stare too much at a woman. And to explain that the LGBTQ community is quite large here.” She has been amazed by the Afghans’ positivity: “The energy that they have for life is just so inspiring. They’ve been knocked out several times over decades and decades of war and they still get up and they’re still willing to rebuild the life in a completely different country, not knowing the language, not knowing the environment, not knowing anything.”",News/UK news,"12,000 Afghan refugees to start new year stuck in UK hotels",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/28/12000-afghan-refugees-to-start-new-year-stuck-in-uk-hotels
12/28/2021,"The construction of a €1bn (£850m) dam on the Vistula River is one step closer to getting the green light in Poland, despite warnings that it could devastate rare wildlife habitats. The Vistula runs more than 620 miles from the Carpathian mountains, passing through major cities before flowing into the Baltic sea. The state-owned company Polish Waters intends to build a dam over the river’s main channel at Siarzewo, north west of Warsaw, with the primary aim of creating hydroelectric power as well as flood protection, water management and navigation.  Discussions about building a dam at Siarzewo have been going on for several years. In August, the plans for the dam were rejected by the Polish environment ministry after a coalition of NGOs warned it would damage one of Europe’s largest rivers, with irreversible impacts for wildlife and people. However, in October that decision was reversed after a successful court appeal by Polish Waters. The provincial administrative court has given consent for “immediate implementation” of the dam. The Siarzewo dam is considered a key component of the E40, a 1,240-mile international waterway that will link the Baltic and Black seas, running through the Chernobyl exclusion zone where dredging started last year. The waterway would dissect Polesia, a large wild area of eastern Europe known as Europe’s Amazon. The dam would directly affect several EU designated wildlife sites downstream of the dam, including Włocławska Vistula valley, Nieszawska Vistula valley and lower Vistula valley, campaigners and scientists have warned. These reserves – which cover an area of 420 square kilometres – are Natura 2000 sites, meaning they protect the continent’s rarest and most threatened species, including the European fire-bellied toad, the large copper butterfly and European river lamprey. The little tern, for example, is listed as vulnerable in Poland and 83% of its population nests in the Vistula valley. Human interventions on river systems are a significant driver of its decline. The proposed site of the dam is also a key spawning ground for critically endangered Baltic sturgeon. “That translates into significant loss to populations of priority habitats and species under the Habitats Directive, including riverine forests,” said Dr Przemysław Chylarecki from the Polish Academy of Sciences. “In such a case the consent can be granted only if it is justified by reasons of overriding public interest. This is not the case for Siarzewo. None of the declared reasons for building the dam can be classified as having overriding public interest.” Legal analysis from WWF Poland has shown that building the dam would violate the EU’s Habitats Directive and the Water Framework Directive. In August, the European Commission said the project did not currently comply with EU law. “All independent environmental NGOs in Poland protested against the Siarzewo dam construction,” said Andrzej Mikulski, a hydrobiologist from Warsaw University. “Environmental consent for Siarzewo dam is highly flawed for the simple reason that the high negative impact of the planned dam on the environment is quite obvious and that this impact is not outweighed by the possible benefits. For several decades, the Polish scientific community has emphasised this many times.” The middle and lower parts of the Vistula are in a natural state – apart from one dam in Włocławek – with high levels of biodiversity thanks to a natural riverbed, floodplain and dynamic arrangement of banks and channels. The dam would turn “several dozen kilometres of the Vistula into a highly eutrophic lake”, degrading the river and valley below the dam, and also making the reintroduction of migratory fish “very difficult or impossible”, according to Mikulski. A 2019 report found that a new generation of hydroelectric dams are threatening Europe’s rivers, fuelling the steep decline of freshwater fish such as salmon, trout and eels, according to the first inventory of Europe’s hydropower plants by RiverWatch. The European Environment Agency has found dams and reservoirs are linked to increased coastal erosion and flooding elsewhere. A spokesperson for Poland’s Ministry of Climate and the Environment said it had not yet received the final judgment on the dam’s construction and that the files regarding the provincial administrative court decision have not yet been returned. “Until the proceedings are resolved, it would be all too soon to comment on the case,” the spokesperson said. A spokesperson for Polish Waters said the Siarzewo dam is necessary to protect human health, the health of the economy and is an important part of flood protection and infrastructure. They added that the project is in keeping and in accordance with Polish law and EU law, the Habitats Directive and Water Framework Directive, and nearly 100 specialists in various fields had worked on the development, including engineers and natural scientists. Polish Waters disputes that the construction will be bad for wildlife or the natural environment. “The results were collected and developed using the most modern methods and techniques available … We wish to add that it is untrue that all environmental organisations are against the implementation of the Siarzewo dam,” the spokesperson said.
