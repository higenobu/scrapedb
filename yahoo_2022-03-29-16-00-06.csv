3/29/2022,"KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) — A Malaysian man with a mental disability lost a final legal appeal Tuesday against his death sentence in Singapore and faces execution soon, a lawyer and rights activists said. Nagaenthran K. Dharmalingam has been on death row since 2010 for trying to smuggle less than 43 grams (1.5 ounces) of heroin into Singapore. At an earlier court hearing, his IQ was revealed to be 69 — a level internationally recognized as an intellectual disability, but the court ruled Nagaenthran knew what he was doing by violating Singapore's harsh anti-drug laws. M. Ravi, a lawyer assisting the case, wrote on Facebook that Singapore's top court ruled that Nagaenthran's appeal was “an abuse of process and that international law does not apply."" “Nagaenthran, who is mentally disabled, is due to be hanged possibly in the next few days,"" he said. U.K.-based rights group Reprieve said Nagaenthran faces imminent execution unless he receives a pardon from Singapore President Halimah Yacob. “The Singaporean government has made clear its commitment to champion the rights of persons with disabilities. Allowing this travesty of justice to take place would fly in the face of those promises,"" Reprieve director Maya Foa said. “ We urge President Halimah Yacob to listen to the cries for mercy within Singapore and around the world, from the United Nations to global business leaders, and spare the life of this vulnerable man."" Foa said in a statement. Anyone found with over 15 grams (0.5 ounces) of heroin faces the death sentence in Singapore, although judges can reduce this to life in prison at their discretion. Nagaenthran was sentenced to death in 2010 and other attempts to reduce his sentence to life in prison or receive a presidential pardon failed. Malaysia’s leader, European Union representatives and global figures such as British business magnate Richard Branson have called for Nagaenthran’s life to be spared and used the case to advocate for ending capital punishment. Singapore’s home affairs ministry has responded that the country has a “zero-tolerance stance against illicit drugs” and that the death penalty has been made clear at its borders.",World/Associated Press,"Disabled Malaysian loses appeal, will be hanged in Singapore",https://news.yahoo.com/disabled-malaysian-loses-appeal-hanged-035013003.html

3/29/2022,"Ezra Miller, who stars in the upcoming DC film “The Flash” and April’s “Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,” was arrested by law enforcement in Hilo, Hawaii on Monday morning. Miller was charged for disorderly conduct and harassment after an incident at a bar. According to a post by the Hawai’i County Police Department, South Hilo officers responded to a report of a disorderly bar patron on Sunday evening at 11:30 p.m. Police determined that the agitator had become unruly while other patrons sang karaoke and had begun “yelling obscenities.” Miller then “grabbed the microphone from a 23-year-old woman singing karaoke and later lunged at a 32-year-old man playing darts.” More from Variety 'All American,' 'Riverdale,' 'Flash,' 'Walker' Among Seven Early Renewals at CW 'Aquaman 2,' 'Flash' Delayed to 2023; 'Shazam 2' Moves to Christmas 2022 in Warner Bros.

Bail was set at $500, which Miller provided, with law enforcement subsequently releasing them from custody. Variety has reached out to Hilo law enforcement, as well as representatives for Miller and Warner Bros., though no parties could be immediately reached for comment. In 2020, footage that appeared to depict Miller choking a woman in a bar in Iceland surfaced online. Sources close to the situation described the situation as a serious altercation which led to Miller being escorted off the premises by staff. Miller’s arrest comes at an inopportune time for Warner Bros., as the performer plays a key role in its upcoming “Harry Potter” spin-off film, “Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,” which is set to begin its global theatrical rollout in April. Miller also plays Barry Allen, also known as the Flash, in the studio’s ongoing slate of DC films. After appearing in “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” “Justice League” and “Zack Snyder’s Justice League,” Miller will marquee their own DC film with “The Flash.” Principal photography has been completed on the solo film, which is set to hit theaters on June 23, 2023. Miller was recently featured during Sunday evening’s Academy Awards broadcast. “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” won in the newly introduced Oscars cheer moment category, which was determined by fan votes through online avenues. A sequence described as “The Flash Enters the Speed Force” was voted the most cheer-worthy moment through online polls ahead of the show, with footage from Miller’s showcase in the film being featured during the Oscars broadcast.

3/29/2022,"By Leika Kihara and Tetsushi Kajimoto TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese policymakers escalated their warning against sharp yen falls, with the country's top currency diplomat saying Tokyo and Washington agreed to ""communicate closely"" on currencies as the world's third-biggest economy struggled to regain its footing. Vice finance minister for international affairs Masato Kanda said ""excess volatility and disorderly"" currency moves were undesirable, signalling Tokyo's displeasure over the yen's steep slide to six-year lows versus the dollar. Aside from such verbal intervention, Japan has several options to stem excessive yen falls. Among them is to directly intervene in the currency market and buy up large amounts of yen. Below are details on how yen-buying intervention could work, the likelihood of this happening as well as challenges: WHEN DID JAPAN LAST CONDUCT YEN-BUYING INTERVENTION? Given the economy's heavy reliance on exports, Japan has historically focused on arresting sharp yen rises and taken a hands-off approach on yen falls. Yen-buying intervention has been very rare. The last time Japan intervened to support its currency was in 1998, when the Asian financial crisis triggered a yen sell-off and a rapid capital outflow from the region. Before that, Tokyo intervened to counter yen falls in 1991-1992. WHAT WOULD PROMPT TOKYO TO BUY YEN AGAIN? Currency intervention is costly and could easily fail given the difficulty of influencing its value in the huge global foreign exchange market. That is one key reason it is considered a last-resort move, which Tokyo would greenlight only when verbal intervention fails to prevent a free fall in the yen. The speed of yen declines, not just levels, would be crucial in authorities' decision on whether and when to step in. Former top currency diplomat Eisuke Sakakibara told Reuters a yen fall below 130 to the dollar could be the trigger for intervention. Some policymakers say intervention would only become an option if Japan faces a ""triple"" selling of yen, domestic stocks and bonds, in what would be similar to sharp capital outflows experienced in some emerging economies. HOW WOULD IT WORK? When Japan intervenes to stem yen rises, the Ministry of Finance issues short-term bills to raise yen which it can then sell in the market to weaken the Japanese currency's value. If it were to conduct intervention to stop yen falls, authorities must tap Japan's foreign reserves for dollars to sell in the market in exchange for yen. In both cases, the finance minister will issue the final order to intervene. The Bank of Japan will act as an agent and execute the order in the market. WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES? Yen-buying intervention is more difficult than yen-selling. To conduct dollar-selling, yen-buying intervention, Japan must tap its foreign reserves for dollars it can sell to markets in exchange for yen. That means there are limits to how long it can keep intervening, unlike for yen-selling intervention - where Tokyo can continue issuing bills to raise yen. Japan's foreign reserves stood at $1.38 trillion, which is the second largest after China's and likely consisted mostly of dollars. While abundant, the size could quickly dwindle if huge sums are required to influence rates each time Tokyo steps in. Currency intervention would also require informal consent by Japan's G7 counterparts, notably the United States if it were to be conducted against the dollar/yen. That is not easy with Washington traditionally opposed to the idea of currency intervention, except in cases of extreme market volatility.
