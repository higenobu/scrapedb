3/1/2022,"By Ron Bousso and Dmitry Zhdannikov LONDON (Reuters) - BP is abandoning its stake in Russian oil giant Rosneft in an abrupt and costly end to three decades of operating in the energy-rich country, marking the most significant move yet by a Western company in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Rosneft accounts for around half of BP's oil and gas reserves and a third of its production and divesting the 19.75% stake will result in charges of up to $25 billion, the British company said, without saying how it plans to extricate itself. ""I have been deeply shocked and saddened by the situation unfolding in Ukraine and my heart goes out to everyone affected. It has caused us to fundamentally rethink bp's position with Rosneft,"" BP Chief Executive Bernard Looney said. The rapid retreat represents a dramatic exit for BP, the biggest foreign investor in Russia, and puts the spotlight on other Western companies with operations in the country including France's TotalEnergies and Britain's Shell, amid an escalating crisis between the West and Moscow. It also underscores growing pressure from Western governments on their companies to curtail operations in Russia as they widen a net of economic sanctions against Moscow. British Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, who on Friday had expressed ""concern"" over BP's Rosneft, welcomed the decision. ""Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine must be a wake up call for British businesses with commercial interests in (President Vladimir) Putin's Russia,"" Kwarteng said on Twitter. Rosneft blamed BP's decision on ""unprecedented political pressure"", Russian news agencies reported, saying 30 years of successful cooperation had been ruined. Susannah Streeter, senior investment analyst at British retail stock broker Hargreaves Lansdown, said it will be ""highly difficult"" for BP ""to recover anywhere near what was considered to be the full value"" of Rosneft. Last week, Looney said that BP was sticking to its Russian business and would comply with any Western sanctions on Moscow. Earlier, Putin put Russia's nuclear deterrent on high alert in the face of Western reprisals for his invasion of Ukraine, which included blocking access to the SWIFT international payment system for some Russian banks. And Norway's $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, will divest its Russian assets after the Ukraine invasion, its prime minister said. DIVIDEND BLOW BP said its move and financial hit will not impact its short and long term financial targets within its strategy to shift away from oil and gas to low-carbon fuels and renewables energy. But Hargreaves Lansdown's Streeter said a write down of this magnitude is ""likely to limit the extent to which BP can continue to accelerate its transition towards renewables."" Looney and his predecessor as CEO Bob Dudley will both step down from the board of Rosneft, which BP acquired a shareholding in as part of its $12.5 billion TNK-BP stake sale in 2013. BP held a board meeting on Friday and another on Sunday where the decision to quit Rosneft, as well as two other joint ventures BP has with Rosneft in Russia, was taken, a spokesperson for the company said. It will take an $11 billion foreign exchange non-cash charge after the exit from Rosneft, which BP will no longer include in its accounts. BP said it also expects a second non-cash charge of up to $14 billion, for the ""carrying value"" of Rosneft. BP received revenue from Rosneft in the form of dividends which totalled around $640 million in 2021, roughly 3% of its overall cash flow from operations. The company currently has around 200 employees in Russia, most of whom are local staff, the BP spokesperson said. Many other Western energy companies have operations in Russia, including TotalEnergies which holds a 19.4% Novatek stake and 20% of the Yamal LNG project. ""In the current environment any European or American company with assets in Russia must be considering similar moves,"" Eurasia Group analyst Henning Gloystein told Reuters.

U.S. Bans Transactions With Russian Central Bank (1:55 p.m.) The U.S. on Monday banned people and companies from doing business with the Bank of Russia, the Russian National Wealth Fund and the Ministry of Finance. The Treasury Department said the actions effectively immobilize any Russian central bank assets held in the U.S. or by U.S. nationals.

The yield on Russia’s $7 billion dollar debt due in 2047 jumped to 8.3% on Monday, doubling from levels seen at the start of February. Despite an emergency rate hike, investors were focused on the sovereign’s credit-rating downgrade to junk from S&P Global Ratings, sanctions on the central bank and the exclusion of some Russian banks from SWIFT -- all of which raised concern that the banking system will get further choked up and the country’s access to sovereign-debt funding will dry up. France to Target Yachts, Luxury Goods Under EU Sanctions (1:17 p.m.) The government in Paris will scrutinize all financial assets – including real estate, yachts, luxury vehicles – that may belong to wealthy Russians targeted by EU sanctions, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said after a cabinet meeting in Paris.

More Than 500,000 Refugees Have Fled Ukraine, UN Official says (10:42 a.m.) The number of people fleeing Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began has crossed the half-million point, Filippo Grandi, the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, said on Twitter. UN agencies said last week the figure could climb to as many as 4 million. Most of those have crossed into the EU, where the four member states bordering Ukraine have registered a surge in arrivals. Poland recorded the most at 281,000 since Feb. 24, while Hungarian officials have counted 85,400. Romania puts the number of Ukrainian citizens crossing into the country at 70,000. Slovakia had taken in as many as 35,000 as of Sunday. Ukraine Asks EU to Accept its Membership Bid (10:51 a.m.) Zelenskiy asked the EU to immediately accept Ukraine into the bloc. “I am sure it is fair. I am sure we deserve this. I am sure that all this is possible,” he told reporters at a briefing at the presidential office. Accession to the EU is a long and arduous process, which requires the candidate country to adopt established EU law as well as to enact reforms -- including to its judicial and economic systems -- to meet the bloc’s criteria. The move also requires the unanimous approval of all EU members, the European Commission and the European Parliament as well as the representatives of all existing member states. Croatia was the last country to join the EU. It applied for membership in 2003 and was granted it in 2013.

3/1/2022,"By Tom Sims, Alexandra Schwarz-Goerlich and Daria Sito-Sucic FRANKFURT/VIENNA/SARAJEVO (Reuters) -The European arm of Sberbank, Russia's biggest lender, faces failure, the European Central Bank (ECB) warned on Monday, after a run on its deposits sparked by the backlash from Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Western allies have taken unprecedented steps to isolate Russia's economy and financial system, including sanctioning its central bank and excluding some of its lenders from the SWIFT messaging system, used for trillions' of dollars of transactions. Sberbank Europe and two other subsidiaries were set to fail, after ""significant deposit outflows"" linked to ""geopolitical tensions"", according to the ECB. Austria's Financial Market Authority imposed a moratorium on Sberbank Europe, which is based in the country. Separately, Deutsche Boerse, the German stock exchange operator, said that it was suspending from trading a number of securities from Russian issuers with immediate effect. The list includes Sberbank. ""We've triggered a run on this kind of bank,"" said Hans-Peter Burghof, a professor at the University of Hohenheim. Western banks and their lawyers are scrambling to assess the impact of the wave of sanctions, which prompted Russia's central bank to more than double its main interest rate on Monday and introduce some capital controls to try and stabilize the rouble. Russia's central bank stands ready to support the nation's banking sector following the high demand for cash, its governor Elvira Nabiullina said. Shares of leading European banks sank with the European banking sector down 5.4%, steeper than a 1.9% fall for the Euro Stoxx index. The market turmoil came as ceasefire talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials began on the Belarusian border on Monday and as Russia faced deepening economic isolation four days after invading Ukraine. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"". European banks with significant operations in Russia were hit the hardest on Monday. Austria's Raiffeisen Bank International fell 13.8% as it said it was working through the impact of sanctions. ""Our Russian subsidiary bank has a very strong liquidity position and is recording inflows,"" RBI's chief executive Johann Strobl said in a statement to Reuters. The ECB's warning extended to Sberbank subsidiaries in Croatia and Slovenia. Sberbank is majority owned by Russia. The lender said in a statement that several of its subsidiaries saw ""significant outflow of client deposits within a very short time"" and that it was in close contact with regulators. Sberbank's branches in Slovenia were closed until Wednesday and services temporarily limited to card transactions with a withdrawal limit of 400 euros a day, the Slovenian central bank said on Monday. The issue has disrupted government benefit payouts through Sberbank. Some 1,000 child welfare payments have been rejected, according to the nation's labour ministry. The Croatian central bank said depositors at Sberbank, which has about a 2% share of the country's banking market, would be allowed to withdraw just under 1000 euros a day. Sberbank Europe said in November it had reached a deal to sell its subsidiaries in Croatia, Slovenia, Hungary, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina to a group including Serbia's AIK bank and Slovenia's Gorenjska bank. Serbian regulators gave their consent on Monday, the only ones yet to do so. Gorenjska said it was no longer viable to proceed with the acquisition of Sberbank's Slovenian subsidiary in the current situation. Depository receipts of Sberbank on the London Stock Exchange were down 70%.

3/1/2022,"(Reuters) -The Russian central bank raised its key interest rate to 20% from 9.5% on Monday in an emergency move, and authorities told export-focused companies to sell foreign currency as the rouble tumbled to record lows. The rouble hit a low of 120 to the dollar on electronic currency trading platform EBS after President Vladimir Putin ordered his military command to put nuclear-armed forces on high alert on Sunday, while the West imposed harsh sanctions against Russia. In another attempt to support the rouble, Russian authorities told Russian exporting companies to sell 80% of their foreign currency revenues on the market, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said. Presenting the new emergency measures, Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said the central bank had stopped interventions on Monday due to the latest western sanctions, suggesting the rouble was supported by other unnamed market participants. The Bank of Russia sold around $1 billion from its reserves on Thursday, Feb. 24, the day when Russia started what it calls a ""special operation"" in Ukraine, and also carried out FX selling on Friday, Nabiullina said. ""Due to restriction on using gold-forex reserves in dollars and euros, interventions were not carried by us today,"" Nabiullina said. Nabiullina also said Russia had an internal replacement for the SWIFT international payments system, adding that foreign counterparts can join it. RATE HIKE The central bank, which says it targets inflation at 4% and will do all necessary to ensure financial stability, said the rate increase will bring deposit rates to levels ""needed to compensate for the increased depreciation and inflation risks"". ""This is needed to support financial and price stability and protect citizens' savings from depreciation,"" it said. The rate hike to levels above the 17% seen in 2014 when Russian annexed Crimea from Ukraine comes after Western countries moved to block certain Russian banks' access to the SWIFT international payment system to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. ""External conditions for the Russian economy have drastically changed,"" the central bank said in a statement. The recent moves add to a slew of measures announced since Thursday to support domestic markets, as the state scrambles to manage the broadening fallout from Western sanctions. Russian authorities have also ordered brokers to suspend short selling on the Russian market and stop executing orders by foreign legal entities and individuals to sell Russian securities. ""These measures may help calm down increased market nervousness, but at the same time they undermine the foundation of the monetary policy, focused on inflationary targeting and flexible exchange rate,"" BCS Global markets said in a note. ""Unfavourable external environment made Russia's monetary policy unsustainable and we do not rule out a possible rate hike going forward or further unexpected and non-market decisions.""

3/1/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Chinese electric-car maker Nio Inc. will start trading on the Hong Kong stock exchange next week, choosing a path to listing that doesn’t involve selling new shares or raising any money. Most Read from Bloomberg Belarus Preparing to Send Soldiers, Report Says: Ukraine Update U.S., Europe Cut Some Russian Banks From SWIFT: Ukraine Update Putin Races the Clock as Fast Military Advance ‘Frustrated’ Elon Musk Activates Starlink Satellites in Response to Ukraine Plea SWIFT Russian Ban Could Force Fed to Step In, Credit Suisse Says The Shanghai-based automaker has applied for a secondary listing of its Class A ordinary shares on the Hong Kong exchange by way of introduction, it said in a statement. Trading is expected to start March 10, subject to final approval from regulators. The company initially filed for a Hong Kong listing in March 2021, but that was delayed amid regulatory concerns about aspects of its structure, Bloomberg News reported last year. In 2019, Chief Executive Officer William Li transferred 50 million company shares to a Nio User Trust, though he retained voting rights over the shares. The move completes a homecoming of sorts by all three U.S.-traded Chinese EV manufacturers -- Nio, Xpeng Inc. and Li Auto Inc. -- after the latter pair listed on the Hong Kong exchange last year. A second listing in Hong Kong provides a hedge against the risk of being delisted from U.S. exchanges. However, unlike its rivals, Nio chose to list by way of introduction -- an easier way for a company already listed elsewhere to join the Hong Kong market. Nio won’t sell shares or raise new funding, so won’t incur additional listing expenses, according to the exchange’s website. Xpeng raised about $2 billion in its Hong Kong listing, while Li Auto raised around $1.7 billion. With its Hong Kong listing delayed, Nio in September raised $2 billion in American depositary receipts. Didi Global Inc., one of the highest-profile targets of a broad Beijing campaign to rein in the country’s giant tech sector, has been working with banks for a listing in Hong Kong that could be by way of introduction, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News last year. The arrangement requires little marketing and would allow U.S. investors to swap their shares for the new stock in Hong Kong. Listing by way of introduction “is an alternative option” for U.S.-listed Chinese companies in an environment of regulatory uncertainty, said Bruce Pang, head of macro and strategy research at China Renaissance Securities Hong Kong Ltd.

Separately, Nio said it has also applied for a secondary listing by way of introduction on the Singapore stock exchange, and the application is under review. Listing in Hong Kong and Singapore will widen Nio’s financing options, mitigate political risk and allow the company to connect more deeply with Asian investors, according to a Citigroup note. Founded in 2014, Nio has recovered from a near-death experience to gain a solid foothold in China’s burgeoning EV market, delivering 91,429 cars in 2021. Its American depositary receipts will continue to be primarily listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Nio’s U.S.-traded shares have slumped 34% this year.

3/1/2022,"(Bloomberg) — The decision to exclude various Russian lenders from the SWIFT messaging system could result in missed payments and giant overdrafts within the international banking system and spur monetary authorities to reactivate daily operations to supply the market with dollars, according to Credit Suisse Group AG strategist Zoltan Pozsar. Most Read from Bloomberg Belarus Preparing to Send Soldiers, Report Says: Ukraine Update U.S., Europe Cut Some Russian Banks From SWIFT: Ukraine Update Elon Musk Activates Starlink Satellites in Response to Ukraine Plea Putin Races the Clock as Fast Military Advance ‘Frustrated’ SWIFT Russian Ban Could Force Fed to Step In, Credit Suisse Says Pozsar published a note Sunday examining the consequences for money markets of the decision to take some lenders off SWIFT, which facilitates trillions of dollars of international payments between institutions. Drawing comparisons with the 2008 Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. failure and the pandemic-related market seizures of March 2020, Pozsar warns that “central banks should stand ready to make markets on Monday again.” “Exclusions from SWIFT will lead to missed payments and giant overdrafts similar to the missed payments and giant overdrafts that we saw in March 2020,” Pozsar wrote. “Banks’ inability to make payments due to their exclusion from SWIFT is the same as Lehman’s inability to make payments due to its clearing bank’s unwillingness to send payments on its behalf. History does not repeat itself, but it rhymes.” In Pozsar’s view, current excess reserves and reverse repurchase agreement facilities won’t be enough, and monetary authorities will need to act. And the upshot from that is that the Federal Reserve, which has been paving the way to start shrinking its balance sheet through so-called quantitative tightening, might actually expand it again first, according to Pozsar. Stepping up the pressure on Russia’s finacial system, European Union foreign affairs ministers approved banning all transactions with the Russian central bank, according to officials familiar with the decision. RUSSIA INSIGHT: Central Bank Sanctions May Light Fuse to Crisis The bank may be rendered “impotent” in defending the ruble if sanctions are successful, according to National Australia Bank Ltd. strategists. The intention of the sanctions is to deny the bank unfettered access to its $643 billion of FX reserves, Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy, wrote in a note. “If CBR can’t access reserves, it can’t defend the RUB from free-fall.” Greenback Surges The greenback is rising against every Group-of-10 peer as fallout from the worsening conflict in Ukraine fuels demand for the world’s reserve currency. Investors are seeking shelter as market volatility surges on the crisis that’s adding to existing global inflationary pressures. A gauge of the dollar climbed as much as 0.6% on Monday, extending last week’s 0.4% gain as Western nations ramped up sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. A key question is how the turmoil will affect the Federal Reserve’s plan for a series of interest-rate hikes starting March. The Russian ruble, which weakened 6.9% to 83 per dollar last week, will be in sharp focus when onshore trading starts Monday. Russian bonds were cut to junk by S&P Global Ratings on Friday. On the ground, citizens have lined up at cash machines around the country to withdraw foreign currency, fearful of a ruble collapse. Officials from Kyiv will meet Russian counterparts at the Belarus border, hours after President Vladimir Putin put Russia’s nuclear forces on higher alert and even as fighting continues inside Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy voiced skepticism that talks would yield results but said he was willing to try if it meant any chance of peace.
