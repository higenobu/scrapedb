12/19/2021,"World health leaders are warning that omicron, the new COVID variant discovered in November, could cause “severe consequences.” Researchers around the world are working tirelessly to learn everything they can about this newest iteration of the virus, which boasts a “Frankenstein mix” of mutations, including more than 30 on the all-important spike protein. Right now, there are still more questions than answers about the variant. We do know that there have been a surge of cases in recent days, and experts believe the variant is more transmissible. All of this bad news and uncertainty can definitely be unsettling for people who’ve spent the last two years coping with pandemic curveball after curveball. Are you wondering what the newest variant means for you and your family, and what symptoms you should be on the lookout for now? Here’s what we know so far. The first doctor to alert health authorities about omicron — who has treated about two dozen patients infected with the variant — told The Telegraph in late November that the symptoms in the patients she saw were surprising to her and relatively benign. “Their symptoms were so different and so mild from those I had treated before,” Dr. Angelique Coetze told the outlet. Coetze said then that her patients were just extremely tired, and one young child had an elevated heart rate. None lost their sense of taste or smell. Some experts are saying that the illness appears to be more mild, although mild symptoms can still be debilitating. There’s also a chance that a mild infection can still lead to long COVID. Overall, you should be on the lookout for the most common symptoms of COVID up to this point in the pandemic: fever or chills, cough, runny nose, headache or muscle aches, gastrointestinal issues and loss of taste or smell. “There’s still a lot we don’t know about this new variant,” Dr. Mahdee Sobhanie, an infectious disease physician at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, told HuffPost. Experts will be looking closely at how the virus affects people based on their age, their underlying immune status and whether or not they’re vaccinated, he said. People who have symptoms of COVID should absolutely get tested, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That includes those who are fully vaccinated, even those who got their boosters. Breakthrough cases are affecting people who have had all three doses. And you should also get tested if you’re not experiencing symptoms, but have come into close contact with someone who has COVID. (Fully vaccinated people should wait five to seven days; those who are not fully vaccinated should get tested immediately and then again several days later.) Keep in mind that we’re deep in respiratory virus season, and health officials have warned that the flu cases are on the rise right now, particularly among younger people. There have also been unusual spikes in respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. The symptoms of all of those illnesses can present quite similarly to COVID, so testing is critical. PCR tests continue to be the gold standard, while rapid antigen tests are less reliable. Still experts say they can be useful to give you a sense of whether you’re contagious on the day you take them, and at-home kits should become more readily available over the next month as the Biden administration has aimed to quadruple availability sometime December. We’ll continue to learn more about omicron in the coming weeks. Sobhanie acknowledged how difficult it can be to wait, particularly during the holiday season when many people were supposed to see loved ones. “There is going to be this stream of data that comes up — a little bit here, a little bit here, a little bit here. But you can’t make policy decisions, and you can’t make clinical decisions, on a little bit of data,” Sobhanie said. “You really need to have all the facts.” For now, experts say the most important thing people can do is stick with the preventive measures that have worked so far: wear a mask when you’re in public indoor settings with substantial or high transmission. Right now, that’s still pretty much the whole country. Also, get vaccinated if you haven’t already, and get boosted. The CDC has stepped up its recommendation in response to the threat of omicron to stave off serious illness, even if breakthrough infections become more common. “What do we know has worked before? We know the vaccines have been very effective against the delta variant. We know that masking works. And I know it’s very difficult, but we just have to wait now and see what the data shows,” Sobhanie said. This story has been updated. Experts are still learning about COVID-19.

12/19/2021,"Guests invited to a holiday party at the home of dedicated coronavirus vaccine opponent Robert Kennedy Jr. received invitations instructing them to get vaccinated or tested for COVID-19 before attending, sources told Politico. Kennedy appeared to confirm the report, explaining to Politico that he was unaware of the instructions in the invitations, which he said were handled by his wife, actor Cheryl Hines of “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” He noted that the party was for Hines’ Hollywood friends and fellow cast members, who apparently like to stay healthy. “I guess I’m not always the boss at my own house,” he griped to Politico. But not to worry, he assured reporter Daniel Lippman. There was no effort to verify guests’ vaccination or test status at the couple’s California home last week, Kennedy said. That information would likely stun guests who assumed others would follow the protocols set out in the invitations. Kennedy issued a statement to HuffPost Saturday emphasizing that he “did not” require his guests to be vaccinated to attend the party. “I believe that every person has the right to make health decisions free from coercion, threats or force by governments, employers, and fellow citizens,” the statement added. “I don’t always agree with the decisions of others, of course, but I always support their liberty to decide for themselves. I extend this respect to everyone including colleagues, friends, and family members.” Hines could not be reached for comment. Kennedy not only relentlessly peddles conspiracy theories about COVID-19 vaccinations; he profits from them. His anti-vaccine group, the Children’s Health Defense — a “major source of vaccine misinformation” — raked in $6.8 million last year, according to a major investigation this week by The Associated Press. Twitter exploded over the controversy, and many slammed Kennedy for throwing his wife under the bus. Mostly, scads of people were flabbergasted to discover Hines is married to Kennedy.

12/19/2021,"When Haley Parke gave birth to her second son on Dec. 2, she was able to meet him and give him a quick kiss before he was whisked away. In what Parke describes as a ""bittersweet"" circumstance, the newborn, named John Beeson Parke and nicknamed baby Jb, was taken to a hospital room two floors above the delivery room to meet his dad and namesake, John Brinton Parke, who went by the nickname Jb. Jb Parke, of Connecticut, was at the end of a nearly one-year battle with a rare type of kidney cancer when a nurse placed his newborn son on his chest. ""Our labor and delivery nurse was the one who brought [baby Jb] up, and she told us later that all of his vitals improved,"" Haley Parke, 28, told ""Good Morning America."" ""And from the time baby Jb was placed on my husband's chest, we had about 35 to 40 minutes together."" Jb Parke, 33, died on Dec. 2, leaving behind an 18-month-old son, Brinton, in addition to his wife and newborn son. ""He was a fighter,"" Haley Parke said of her husband of three years, whom she met through work in 2016. ""He was he wasn't really ever willing to give up. He wanted to keep fighting for his family."" Jb Parke, a former all-star baseball player who went on to work for an aviation company, was diagnosed with cancer in January 2021, when his oldest son Brinton was 6-months-old. Facing a very rare form of the disease, he underwent surgery in January to remove his left kidney, which had a tumor the size of a softball, according to Haley Parke. Around four months later, as Jb Parke was undergoing chemotherapy treatments and participating in clinical trials, the couple decided to move forward with having a second child. ""Since the diagnosis was terminal, we decided to make the choice to get pregnant 10 months postpartum from our first son,"" said Haley Parke. ""We wanted to make sure that our son had a sibling and that my husband would have, we were hoping, more time with our second son."" Haley Parke became pregnant in April using a frozen embryo the couple had stored after undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) to get pregnant with Brinton.

""Pretty much every scan showed continued growth and continued spread throughout his entire body, so nothing was really touching the cancer,"" she said, adding that she and Jb tried to stay positive and hopeful that doctors could extend his life further than expected. ""We just tried to stay positive and keep our heads up and keep looking forward."" Kate Parke, Jb Parke's younger sister, said she witnessed her brother and sister-in-law's strength firsthand through those hard months. ""I just watched Haley and my brother continuously show up for each other,"" she said. ""Even when he was very sick, he planned a surprise sprinkle for for her last month."" ""He always put his family first,"" Kate Parke continued. ""Even when he physically couldn't do things, he made sure that they knew they were appreciated and they were his first priority."" The Parkes faced another gut-wrenching decision on Dec. 1 when doctors told them that instead of an anticipated six months, Jb Parke had just days to live. At the time, Haley Parke was 37 weeks pregnant. She said when she and her husband were in the meeting with doctors, her first question was if she could deliver their baby early. MORE: Daughter donates part of her liver to save her critically ill dad ""I looked at the doctors and said, 'Is it crazy to ask for an induction?' and I looked at my husband and I said, 'Is that something we should do?' and he looked at me and he nodded,"" recalled Haley Parke. ""And one of the doctors responded, 'I was thinking the exact same thing.'"" Less than 24 hours later, it was Dec. 2, the day Haley Parke gave birth to her son and said a final goodbye to her husband. Just before she left her husband's bedside to be induced, Haley Parke told him she wanted to give their son his same name. ""I whispered to him, 'OK, I'm gonna go get induced and go have our baby and I'm going to name him John Beeson, Jb,'"" said Haley Parke. ""And he kind of gave me a little moan and nodded his head, as like reassurance that he kind of like agreed and was in favor of that name choice."" Emma McGlynn, a registered nurse at Hartford Hospital, in Hartford, Conn., was the postpartum nurse who took care of Haley Parke and baby Jb after the delivery. McGlynn told ""GMA"" she and the other healthcare workers present were ""in awe"" of how it all unfolded. ""The staff in the ICU made it so he was able to have the baby right on his chest without the medical equipment in the way, and he was okay for that moment,"" she said. ""I just kept my eyes on [baby Jb] so he could stay with his dad and he rocked it."" Speaking of Haley Parke's strength, McGlynn noted she was taken directly from the labor and delivery operating room to her husband's room in the ICU, skipping the typical postpartum recovery process. ""Haley was intending to have a home birth with a team of midwives and going from that plan to deciding to get medically induced to having a c-section in a matter of hours, it shows how amazing she is,"" said McGlynn. ""At the drop of a hat, she was like we’re doing this and my son is going to meet his dad."" And though he was born three weeks premature, baby Jb was born healthy and strong, weighing 7 pounds, 4 ounces, according to Haley Parke, who said she put her faith in God that her son would be born safely and able to meet his dad. ""With the induction process, one of the doctors had to make clear that there could be some NICU time involved and that if the baby needed support of any kind, you'd have to go straight to the NICU and wouldn't be able to be with my husband,"" he said. ""So it was kind of a pretty big risk and I had to put a lot of faith in God that he was going to pull us through and make sure my baby was healthy and able to get to his daddy in time."" Now two weeks into being a mother of two and still grieving her husband, Haley Parke said life feels ""like a blur."" A GoFundMe page has been set up to help the family. ""It doesn't really feel real yet,"" she said, describing ""complex emotions"" that happen ""sometimes within the same minute."" "" The grief comes and goes, but it's also accompanied with the greatest joy of my new son and my oldest obviously too."" Haley Park said her newborn, baby Jb, is easygoing and calm, ""just like his dad,"" whom she hopes is remembered as ""the most selfless person."" ""My favorite part about him was he deeply respected our relationship and he loved me and our kids on a whole other level that most people don't experience in a lifetime,"" she said. ""He was so pure with all of his intentions and was just a very respectful and an honorable husband.""

12/19/2021,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — The newly crowned Miss America has made history, becoming both the first Korean American and the first Alaskan to hold the title in the competition’s 100-year history. “I never could have imagined in a million years that I would be Miss America, let alone that I would be Miss Alaska,” a beaming Emma Broyles told The Associated Press on Friday in a Zoom call from Connecticut, where she won the competition about 12 hours earlier. In fact, she was sure they had it wrong. The final two contestants were Broyles and Lauren Bradford, Miss Alabama, and Broyles said she was thinking Bradford was going to make an amazing Miss America. “And then they said Alaska, and I said, ‘No way. Are you sure? Do you want to check that card again?” she said before the emotion overtook her and she began crying tears of joy. “I could not believe it,” Broyles said. “I am so, so grateful to everybody back at home who’s been supporting me for so long, and I’m so glad that I’m able to bring home the title of Miss America to the state of Alaska for the first time in history.” The very first Miss America program began in 1921 as a beauty pageant in Atlantic City, New Jersey. However, Broyles is only the 94th Miss America. The pageant, which has evolved away from the emphasis on looks to focusing on leadership, talent and communication skills, was not held last year because of the pandemic and it wasn’t held for several years in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Broyles, 20, said her grandparents immigrated from Korea to Anchorage about 50 years ago, before her mother was born. “Although my mom is full Korean, she was born and raised right in Anchorage, Alaska,” Broyles said. The Miss America Organization “believes Emma is the first Korean-American to win the crown,” spokesperson Matt Ciesluk said in a text message to the AP. Her mother is a special education teacher at Service High School in Anchorage, the same school Broyles attended. Broyles has chosen the Special Olympics for her social impact initiative. Besides her mother’s position, her older brother, Brendan, has Down syndrome and competes in athletic events with Special Olympics Alaska. “I’ve seen firsthand the impact that Special Olympics has on the families of people with intellectual disabilities. And I know how important Special Olympics is to our community here in Anchorage and here in Alaska, as well as the communities all over the country and all over the world,” she said. Broyles said she looks forward to working with Special Olympics to promote inclusion, compassion and open-mindedness through sports. “Getting to have this platform to speak about why inclusion is important during a time like this when our country is so divided, and to speak about why it’s important to be compassionate, why it’s important to be empathetic, why it’s important to keep an open mind and to be willing to listen to those who aren’t like you or maybe have different opinions than you, I think that this is a time where we need that more than ever,” she said. Broyles winning the Miss America title wasn’t the first barrier broken by an Alaska woman this year. Last summer, teenager Lydia Jacoby of Seward, Alaska, came from out of nowhere to win the women’s 100-meter breaststroke at the Tokyo Olympic Games. She became the first Alaskan to ever qualify for the Olympics in swimming, let alone win gold. “I think it’s incredibly cool that Alaskan women are representing Alaska, representing our home state so well and getting the recognition I think we deserve,” Broyles said. Along with her title, Broyles earned just over $100,000 in college scholarships, which she calls a “life changing amount of money.” She’s currently a junior at Arizona State University studying biomedical sciences and voice performance and said the scholarship money will allow her to attend medical school. But for the next year, she will travel about 20,000 miles (32,187 kilometers) every month serving as a role model and advocate for young women, the Miss America Organization said in a statement. Broyles’ future plans include becoming a dermatologist and returning to Alaska to practice her profession. “There's just something special about Anchorage, which is why I know that I want to spend the rest of my life in Anchorage, even despite this little hiatus I’m taking,” she said.",U.S./Associated Press,"New Miss America first Alaskan, Korean American title holder",https://news.yahoo.com/miss-america-first-alaskan-korean-215204041.html
12/19/2021,"By Philip Pullella VATICAN CITY (Reuters) -The Vatican on Saturday warned conservative Roman Catholics who have balked at Pope Francis' decision to restrict the old traditionalist Latin Mass that they were sowing division and engaging in ""sterile polemics"". The Vatican department overseeing sacraments and liturgy issued a directive in response to bishops' requests for clarification following a document in July in which Francis overturned decisions by his two predecessors and tightened access to the Mass. Since July some conservatives, including bishops, have openly defied the pope, resulting in the latest chapter of what some have dubbed the Church's ""liturgy wars"". Religious conservatives in the United States in particular have used the Latin Mass debate to align with politically conservative media outlets to criticise the pope over a host of other issues such as climate change, immigration and social justice. ""As pastors we must not lend ourselves to sterile polemics, capable only of creating division, in which the ritual (the Mass) itself is often exploited by ideological viewpoints,"" Archbishop Arthur Roche, head of the department, wrote in an introductory letter to the responses to 11 questions. Saturday's document said conservatives who favour the Latin Mass cannot use such a sacred part of Catholicism to deny the ""validity and legitimacy"" of the reforms of the 1962-1965 Second Vatican Council, which included an opening to the modern world and dialogue with other religions, particularly Judaism. It also made clear that pre-Vatican II Latin rites should not be used for other sacraments, such as confirmation. Joseph Shaw, chairman of the Latin Mass Society in Britain said in a tweet that the document ""will have serious negative consequences"" and drive Catholics who want to remain in unity with their bishop to join extremist groups. Before the Council, Catholic Mass was an elaborate ritual led in Latin by a priest facing east with his back to the congregation. Vatican II modernised the liturgy, including more active participation by the congregation, and had the priest face the faithful to pray in their local language. Traditionalists, who are a small but very vocal minority in the 1.3 billion-member Church, have rejected the new Mass, which is known as the Novus Ordo and entered into general use in the early 1970s. Many missed the Latin rite’s sense of mystery and awe and the centuries-old sacred music that went with it. Both former Pope Benedict and Pope John Paul II had relaxed restrictions on the Latin Mass in an olive branch to conservatives. In re-introducing the restrictions in July, Francis said his predecessors' leniency, while well-intentioned, had been ""exploited"" for ideological reasons.
