1/20/2022,"Boris Johnson’s fall is not yet a fact. But it grows more likely by the hour. The hue and cry resumed at full throttle on Wednesday morning. Then Christian Wakeford, Conservative MP for the “red wall” marginal of Bury South, who had been the regional chief of the Back Boris campaign in 2019, defected to Labour. Thirty minutes later, David Davis quoted Leo Amery (who was quoting Oliver Cromwell) telling Neville Chamberlain in 1940: “In the name of God, go.” No leader can indefinitely survive these levels of assault. Assuming it now takes place, there are two important things to keep in mind about the 2022 Conservative leadership election. The first is that the many twists in this extraordinary story may not have all been exhausted. Experience of recent Tory leadership contests suggests that we should expect the unexpected.  There are many possibilities. Johnson could pre-empt a confidence vote by the uncharacteristic act of resigning. He may decide to walk away from No 10 immediately, presumably leaving Dominic Raab as temporary prime minister and boosting the justice secretary’s otherwise slim chances. One or more leadership candidates may also pull out unexpectedly, as Johnson and Andrea Leadsom did in 2016, opening the way for Theresa May’s win. Improbably, the Tory party could unite behind Rishi Sunak without a vote, as it did behind Michael Howard in opposition in 2003. The second, if the election process runs its full course, is that this will produce the first change of leader of its kind in British political history. Never before would a prime minister have been forced out by his or her party’s own MPs and then been replaced by a new prime minister chosen by the party’s members. That scenario is stuffed with political dynamite. It could be a brilliant, gamechanging success – but it could just as well be an absolute disaster. There are no precedents. One thing is sure. If Johnson loses the vote of confidence for which MPs are now sending in letters, he would certainly be out. He cannot contest the leadership election that would follow. Not even Johnson can break that rule. This is what happened to Iain Duncan Smith as leader of the opposition in 2003. But it has never happened to a serving Tory prime minister. The last three Tory prime ministers who lost power midterm all did so by resigning. Each quit because the writing was on the wall. Margaret Thatcher decided not to contest the second round of the 1990 contest in order to open the way for someone else – John Major, as it turned out – to stop Michael Heseltine. David Cameron stepped down after losing the vote to leave the European Union in 2016. Although May had survived a confidence vote the previous December, she was forced to quit in May 2019 as the Tory party fell apart over her Brexit strategy. To kick a prime minister out in a vote of no confidence is a very big call indeed. It would be a damning verdict on Johnson personally and on his “great man” view of history and himself. He might not hang around in the Commons, triggering a very losable byelection in Uxbridge. His rejection could cause him to become bitter in his old age, as Ted Heath’s did in 1975. Even more significantly, it could entrench lasting political divisions in the Tory ranks, as the fall of Robert Peel did in 1846. There would be implications for party political realignment here. The immediate political question that most matters is whether the ousting of Johnson will outrage the party membership. There is every reason to expect this, and MPs need to be prepared for it. Judging by the Tories’ recent leadership contests – this would be the third in six years – there will again be lots of candidates: not surprising, with the premiership as the prize. Eight tried to enter the race in 2016. Thirteen tried in 2019. With no overwhelming favourite this time, expect another crowded field as MPs seek to winnow the contest to the final two, from whom the membership will choose. Conventionally, political parties in revolt against themselves tend to choose the opposite kind of leader to the one they have just got rid of. Johnson rather than May is a classic example. Further back, Major rather than Thatcher is another. That might point to Rishi Sunak this time as the candidate with most of the skills Johnson lacks, or suggest Jeremy Hunt would be in with a chance. This doesn’t take into account the cultural and ideological differences between the largely southern, largely old, largely white membership and many of the parliamentarians. For that reason, the candidates who claim to be picking up the populist standard from Johnson may do best. Liz Truss is the initial frontrunner, judging by membership surveys, but Priti Patel will see this contest as her best shot too. Watch out for Steve Baker, who may decide he has the organisation skills to beat Truss among the MPs. Baker will then offer himself to the membership as the only candidate who can be guaranteed to save Brexit and prevent Nigel Farage from mounting a comeback. Much will also rest on the contest’s length and timing. The 2019 contest took nearly two months before Johnson was confirmed winner. If this one does the same, the candidates may have to juggle their responses to anything from a new Covid variant to the energy price rise, trying to sort the Northern Ireland protocol before the May elections, or a Russian invasion of Ukraine. Sunak is still probably the best bet in this race. But do not believe anyone who claims they know for certain where all this is leading. They don’t.

1/20/2022,"Xavi Hernández has delivered Ousmane Dembélé a public ultimatum: extend your contract or leave now. The Barcelona manager said the 24-year-old, whose deal expires at the end of the season, had told him that he wanted to continue at the club but no agreement has been reached. With little prospect of a solution and Dembélé’s agent Moussa Sissoko accusing the club of mishandling negotiations, patience has run out. “We’re in a position in which we have to stop this right now,” Xavi said. “Either he renews or we will look for an exit for him.”  Whether Barcelona are able to impose that ultimatum is another matter, with Xavi admitting that Dembélé has the “upper hand”. He can leave for free at the end of the season and has been allowed to talk to other clubs since 1 January. The coach was inclined to continue playing him even if he admitted that he intends to depart, but the club are considering leaving him out of the squad for the remaining six months if he does not renew – not least as a means of forcing a solution. It is a threat that Sissoko accused them of having already made: “That will not work with us,” he said. Asked about the prospect of leaving Dembélé in the stands for six months, Xavi said: “That’s not something I’m contemplating.” “I too ask myself why he says he wants to renew but hasn’t,” Xavi said, hinting at the apparently different positions held by Sissoko and his client, as well as the possibility that Dembélé has not been honest with Barcelona, seeming instead to avoid a commitment. The coach was speaking before Barcelona’s Copa del Rey meeting on Thursday with Athletic Club and he admitted that a decision must be made on whether or not to leave Dembélé out of the squad. He and Mateu Alemany, the director of football, were due to meet for further discussions on Wednesday. When Xavi was presented as Barcelona’s manager, he insisted that Dembélé could be “the best in the world” in his position, describing his renewal as a “priority”. Alongside him the president, Joan Laporta, smiled and said: “Understood.” His renewal was also a means to free up salary mass and enable them to sign other players, the dependence on Dembélé’s deal deepening. But no agreement has been reached, the player’s camp reportedly asking for a salary of about €40m a year. “If Barcelona had wanted to negotiate they could have sat down with us to discuss it,” Sissoko said. Alemany insisted during the presentation of Ferran Torres: “We have been very patient. They knew we want him to stay and he has our offer. We can’t delay much longer.” Now, with 12 days remaining in this transfer window, they have decided that they cannot delay any more. Xavi also revealed the extent to which he has had to adopt the position of the club. With pessimism growing to the point where Barcelona no longer believe Dembélé intends to sign a new deal, they have sought to force the issue and break the deadlock. “In the end, the club has decided that if he doesn’t renew, we have to seek a solution,” Xavi said. “We have to do what’s best for the club. It’s five months now that Mateu Alemany has been talking to him and his representatives. “I have been very honest with him. It’s not an easy situation. It doesn’t feel good but the club’s interests have to come first. This case is very complex and we have reached a point where we have to decide. The player has to think about the club a bit. He knows what the project is; I couldn’t have put more trust in him.”",Sport/Football,"Ousmane Dembélé must sign new Barcelona contract or leave, says Xavi",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/19/ousmane-dembele-sign-new-barcelona-contract-or-leave-xavi
1/20/2022,"They were once among Boris Johnson’s most loyal defenders. Many of the army of more than 100 MPs who sat in Westminster for the first time in December 2019 felt they owed the prime minister their seat. So they were initially on their best behaviour, keen in a much-expanded parliamentary party to stand out from their peers and secure early promotion to the lowest rungs of the ministerial ladder. And most still feel that way.  But a small and growing number have been turned off Johnson and feel enough is enough. They bit their tongues through a slew of crises and have now concluded that Johnson will not be the same electoral asset at the next general election as he was at the last. Among their number was Christian Wakeford, the MP for Bury South perhaps best known for calling the disgraced former cabinet minister Owen Paterson a “cunt” as MPs voted on changing the standards system to save his skin. Wakeford was a longtime agitator of the government, unafraid to make his feelings known in public. He admitted on Tuesday to having put in a letter calling for a no-confidence vote in Johnson the week before. Then, minutes before prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, he defected to Labour. However, Wakeford had not been invited to join the group of about two dozen Tory MPs who met twice this week to discuss whether to submit letters. The first took place on Monday in the office of Chris Loder, the MP for West Dorset. He has made clear his unhappiness at the rule-breaking Downing Street parties, telling constituents: “I’d like you to know that I and most of my colleagues feel deeply embarrassed and humiliated by such revelations.” The second was on Tuesday afternoon in an office shared by Alicia Kearns, another 2019er who represents Rutland and Melton, and Lee Anderson, the bombastic “red wall” MP for Ashfield. This became known as the “pork pie plot” – a name bestowed by detractors in a reference to the savoury snack that originated in Kearns’s constituency. Among those also at the 2019ers’ meeting were Gary Sambrook, the MP for Birmingham Northfield, Aaron Bell, the MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme, and Tom Randall, the MP for Gedling in Nottinghamshire. But the newer MPs are not acting alone. After the second meeting, some debriefed more experienced colleagues who are also trying to engineer Johnson’s deposition. And before PMQs was over, the role of longstanding MPs among the rebels was underlined as David Davis, the former leadership contender first elected to parliament in 1987, told Johnson: “In the name of God, go.” It is understood junior colleagues had been pressing Davis to make a statement publicly calling for Johnson to go, saying the situation needed a “big figure” to intervene. Kearns is on the 1922 Committee executive, some of whom met at the members-only Carlton Club in London on Tuesday night as speculation reached fever pitch that the number of no-confidence letters was approaching the 54 needed to trigger a vote. Allies of the former senior Ministry of Defence civil servant, who was dropped as a parliamentary private secretary last year, denied she was leading a rebellion. Such is the level of mistrust that briefing and counter-briefing in Westminster turned to misinformation. A Tory MP wrongly proclaimed that Johnson had personally arrived at the Carlton Club at about 11pm in “a last-ditch desperate attempt to persuade people to support him”. Rumours also abounded that a special adviser to the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, had been sent to spy on the group – though she said they were there to speak at a club dinner. Some older MPs look down their noses at the latest intake, whom they view as too big for their boots. “We’ve got enough problems with kids running No 10 without promoting more 2019 [MPs] with no experience,” one said. Another talked about them condescendingly as “boys and girls”. Some of the “old guard” of one nation Tories are fearful their fresh-faced colleagues will trigger a confidence vote before the report into Downing Street parties being written by the civil servant Sue Gray is completed. “It boosts his chance of survival if he can say he hasn’t had a fair hearing yet,” one said. But the new intake feel they have just as much right to make their views known as other colleagues. “Every MP is entitled to their own view no matter how long they’ve been here,” said one. “I don’t think trying to pull rank based on seniority is a good idea.” There are also still plenty in the new intake who still support Johnson and have not given up on hopes he will lead the party into the next election. A frontbencher said that beyond a few dozen malcontents, the rest backed the prime minister and were “absolutely furious” at their colleagues’ actions. Given the magnitude of Johnson’s success in the 2019 election, they believe he deserves at least one more chance. Johnson’s supporters come from different pools – red wall MPs, those in Lib Dem marginals, safe seats that became vacant at the last election, and others with complex psephological factors. But his critics are from equally disparate pools. Having not been present for the last regicide that took place less than three years ago, the 2019ers trying to force Johnson out have no experience at engineering a revolt from the backbenches. Neither they, nor angry older colleagues biding their time until Gray’s findings are released, have won yet.",News/Politics,The 2019ers: Tory unease as some of party’s newest MPs turn on Boris Johnson,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/19/tory-party-unease-2019-intake-newest-mps-turn-on-boris-johnson
1/20/2022,"The EU must open its own talks with Russia rather than rely on Washington, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has said as he warned of the prospect of the “most tragic thing of all – war”. In a wide-ranging speech in Strasbourg, Macron said it was not sufficient for the US to negotiate with the Kremlin over its threats to peace but that Europe needed to have its voice heard.  Macron said he hoped to revitalise four-way talks between Russia, Germany, France and Ukraine, known as the Normandy format, to find a solution to the escalating crisis. The French president, who was speaking to mark the start of his country’s six-month presidency of the EU, told MEPs: “I think our credibility vis-a-vis Russia lies primarily in entering into demanding dialogue. “And we see that looking at the dialogue that the US and Russia are currently undertaking. I think that it is good for there to be coordination between Europe and the US but it is vital that Europe has its own dialogue with Russia.” Officials in Brussels insist that Russia has not been able to divide the west in recent months as it has amassed more than 100,000 troops on its border with Ukraine. But for all the protests of a unified approach, the EU was sidelined from talks held last week between Russia and the US, Nato and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. The Normandy format is a legacy of a meeting of the leaders of Germany, France, Ukraine and Russia during the 2014 D-day celebrations. It subsequently became a vehicle for implementation of the 2015 Minsk agreements designed to end the separatist war in Ukraine’s Donbas region that followed Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea. Macron said, however, that the EU had to work out a coordinated approach in its future talks with Russia and address its vulnerabilities with regard to the Kremlin, including energy supply. The EU has threatened severe economic and diplomatic consequences should there be a further military incursion. But the 27 member states are divided as to what should trigger sanctions, with some arguing that cyber-attacks or false-flag operations should be dealt with in the same way as a full-on occupation. Macron said: “We’ve seen migration movements being manipulated. We’ve seen cyber-attacks. We’ve seen hikes in gas prices. And on this front we need to build in collective resilience together. “The security of our continent requires strategic rethinking, strategic rearming of Europe as an area of balance and peace. And when it comes to dialogue with Russia in particular. “This dialogue is something I’ve been standing up for for many years. It’s not just a vague idea … We need this dialogue we need in Europe collectively to set out our own requirements and make certain that they are respected, and we need to be in a position to make that happen.” Beyond the escalating security threat to the east, Macron touched on a range of EU priorities for the French government, including strengthening the rule of law within the bloc, reducing the gender wage gap and giving rights to people who are commissioned with piecemeal work through web platforms. He also proposed including the right to abortion in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. Citing the issues of Northern Ireland and fishing rights in UK waters, he warned the British government that in order to “remain friends” it “needs to commit to itself in good faith respecting the agreements already concluded with the union”. Macron told critical MEPs that he would not use the EU presidency as a “springboard” for his reelection as French president in three months’ time. However, he challenged those who equated his belief in stronger powers at an EU level with a lack of patriotism. He said: “I will distinguish between those that love their country and culture … and those that want to destroy Europe. I think actually there is a majority here, for example, who believe in Europe but also the cultures and identities of each country but still fight against the barbaric acts of nationalism.” Ahead of the first round of the French presidential election in April, Macron’s political opponents, including on the European parliament benches, sought to use his appearance to criticise his record. Yannick Jadot, the Green MEP and presidential candidate, told Macron he had “sacrificed” Europe’s ambitions on the climate crisis. “You will go down in history as the president of climate inaction.” Jordan Bardella, an MEP from Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally, told the parliament that European immigration policy meant member states and their people could no longer decide “who enters or leaves their territory” so Europe risked “no longer being Europe”. Meanwhile, the far-right TV pundit and presidential challenger Éric Zemmour headed to Calais in northern France to deliver a speech on the site of a former makeshift camp where thousands of migrants had once slept rough as they hoped to stow away on lorries to reach England. He said France should immediately deport any migrant entering its territory who hoped to reach the UK. He said that, because of immigration, Macron’s idea of Europe was “a Europe without mind, body or soul, pulling up its own roots, erasing its own history”.",News/World news,Macron says EU must start own dialogue with Russia over Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/macron-says-eu-must-start-own-dialogue-with-russia-over-ukraine

1/20/2022,"The mystery shrouding Amazon’s new JRR Tolkien adaptation has lifted slightly, as the show has revealed its title. The multi-series epic will be known as Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, setting viewers up for an on-screen representation of a new Middle-earth story. “The Rings of Power unites all the major stories of Middle-earth’s Second Age: the forging of the rings, the rise of the Dark Lord, Sauron, the epic tale of Númenor and the Last Alliance of Elves and Men,” said showrunners, JD Payne and Patrick McKay, in a statement accompanying a video that shows the programme’s title being forged in a blacksmith’s foundry.  “Until now, audiences have only seen on-screen the story of the One Ring – but before there was one, there were many … and we’re excited to share the epic story of them all.” Filming of the first season took place in New Zealand, with the second series due to begin shooting in the UK after a surprise decision to move countries. It is widely believed to be the most expensive TV show of all time, with Amazon beating Netflix to a $250m (£207m) deal with the Tolkien estate, HarperCollins and Warner Bros to acquire the rights to the fantasy story. It is reportedly spending around $1bn on the adaptation, over a multi-series deal expected to run to at least five series. In 2017, a Tolkien expert working on the Lord of the Rings adaptation confirmed that Amazon didn’t have permission from the author’s estate to use the bulk of the material from his novel – and, so, the plot would not cross over with the Peter Jackson movies. As a result, the series will be a prequel, set thousands of years before the novel and the book that precedes it, The Hobbit. Details of the plot are scarce, but Tolkien’s the Second Age begins after the banishment of the dark lord Morgoth. It ends with the first demise of Sauron, Morgoth’s servant and the primary villain in The Lord of the Rings, at the hands of an alliance of elves and men. Amazon’s synopsis describes the show as, “beginning in a time of relative peace”, stating that it will “follow an ensemble cast of characters, both familiar and new, as they confront the long-feared reemergence of evil to Middle-earth.” The teaser video features a speech known as the “Ring Verse”. Given that it references 20 separate rings, it seems likely that the Prime series will feature 20 rings of power, unlike the one featured in previous adaptations. Its first episode is scheduled to premiere on Amazon Prime Video on 2 September, as well as being simulcast in 240 countries.",Arts/Television & radio,"‘Until now, audiences have only seen the story of the One Ring’: details announced for Lord of The Rings TV show",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/19/until-now-audiences-have-only-seen-the-one-ring-details-announced-for-lord-of-the-rings-tv-show
1/20/2022,"Greece showcased its newly acquired defence capabilities on Tuesday as six Rafale fighter jets, recently arrived from France, flew over the Acropolis. The jets roared over the symbolic monument en route to the Tanagra airbase, highlighting the Greek government’s decision to press ahead with a major military overhaul amid tensions with Turkey.  “These new warplanes make our air force one of the strongest in Europe and the Mediterranean,” said Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, attending a reception ceremony at the airbase north of Athens. While deterrence was the ultimate goal the acquisitions would bolster “the flexibility of our national diplomacy”, he said. The centre-right administration has announced a seven-fold increase in defence spending on last year. Greek combat pilots are frequently forced to engage in mock dogfights in Aegean airspace disputed by Turkey with Mitsotakis describing the need to upgrade the air force as urgent. In addition to 24 Rafales, both old and new, Athens will take stock of warships, helicopters and 84 modernised US-made F-16s aircraft as part of a procurement programme that will include the purchase of Meteor air-to-air missiles. The acquisition of F-35 stealth combat aircraft – seen as a gamechanger by the Hellenic armed forces – is also being discussed, according to defence experts in Washington and Athens. The purchase of the French-made Rafales comes amid a military overhaul that is projected to cost Greece €11.5bn by 2025 and is not without controversy. The leftwing opposition party Syriza has called the spending “excessive” at a time when the pandemic and cost of living crisis weigh ever more heavily on Greece. The overhaul is aimed as much at strengthening the nation’s war readiness against Turkey as reinforcing its security role on Nato’s southeastern flank. Analysts described the acquisition of the Rafales as a turning point in the Hellenic air force’s long-range missile capacity. “Their arrival marks the first in a series of defence deals that are currently in motion,” said Ioannis Michaletos at the Institute for Security and Defence Analysis. “Greece has not bought weapons in such quantities for more than a decade. It’s going to be a very eventful year in terms of European contractors coming to Athens to try and seal deals.” Tensions over rival claims to offshore gas reserves in the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean brought Greece and Turkey to the brink of war in 2020. Ankara’s recent economic woes, in the wake of the country’s currency crisis, has also caused nervousness in Athens. “Aside from the perennial antagonism between Greece and Turkey, both also want to upgrade their role within Nato because of the diplomatic and political consequences that will bring,” said Michaletos. The sight of the French fighter jets in Greek skies came barely four months after Mitsotakis signed an historic, multi-billion euro military accord with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in Paris. Under the deal France will deliver three state-of-the art Belharra frigates to Greece by 2025. France’s deteriorating ties with Turkey has been echoed by an enhancement in bilateral relations between Athens and Paris cemented by the nations’ shared common interests in the Mediterranean.",News/World news,Greece receives six French fighter jets as part of €11.5bn military overhaul,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/greece-receives-six-french-fighter-jets-as-part-of-115bn-military-overhaul
1/20/2022,"Ireland is to get a bank holiday as a national commemoration of those who have lost their lives to Covid and to recognise those who worked on the frontline of the pandemic, the government has announced. Frontline healthcare workers in hospitals and nursing homes are also to receive a €1,000 (£830) tax-free bonus for their contribution to the national pandemic effort as part of a package of measures agreed by the cabinet on Wednesday.  The government has estimated the cost of the giveaway at €100m, but questions remain as to who will qualify for the handouts. Leo Varadkar, the tánaiste and minister for enterprise, trade and employment, said the bank holiday was “to recognise all of those workers, volunteers and members of the general public, who helped us in this fight against the pandemic, and especially frontline healthcare workers”. It will be on Friday 18 March this year, creating a four-day weekend because it falls immediately after the bank holiday for St Patrick’s Day. From next year, however, the government will establish a new bank holiday on 1 February, St Brigid’s Day, which marks the Celtic festival of Imbolc, or rebirth and the coming of spring. The day is also seen as a way to celebrate women, with the government’s website describing the Celtic goddess’s heritage as a “symbol of feminine energy”. A range of prominent Irish figures including the singer Imelda May have suggested a new bank holiday for a while as a way of encompassing both the pandemic frontline effort and women. Melanie Lynch, the head of Herstory.ie, the group that started the St Brigid’s Day campaign, wrote to the taoiseach to argue that Brigid’s “healing powers and compassion for the sick and poor” was a reason to mark the day publicly. Another individual wrote anonymously to say that making St Brigid’s Day a bank holiday would recognise “that so many on the frontline are female”. The decision to give €1,000 to health workers will go some way to addressing concern that a bank holiday would not be a valuable reward for those work every day to keep hospitals and hospices operational. The Irish Nurse and Midwives Organisation said it was very happy with the bonus decision. “It’s a small thank you but it’s very welcome … it’s something that we sought last November and it’s the right thing to do,” its general secretary, Phil Ní Sheaghdha, said. Those who work in private healthcare settings will be included, the health minister, Stephen Donnelly, has said. The St Brigid’s Day holiday will bring the number of bank and public holidays in Ireland to 10, two more than England, but in line with Northern Ireland.",News/World news,Ireland announces annual bank holiday to honour Covid victims and workers,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/ireland-announces-annual-bank-holiday-to-honour-covid-victims-and-workers
1/20/2022,"The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said Russia could take “further aggressive action” against Ukraine “at any moment”, adding that Vladimir Putin’s military intentions were still unclear as he prepared for talks with his Russian counterpart at the end of the week. Speaking after meeting Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in Kyiv, Blinken said Russia had amassed “very significant forces” on Ukraine’s borders, including in Belarus where major exercises are due to begin next month. It could double them in “relatively short order”, he said.  Before talks on Friday in Geneva with Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, Blinken said he was relentlessly pursuing a peaceful solution to the crisis. But there seem few signs that Moscow and Washington can reach diplomatic agreement in Switzerland. The Kremlin wants Nato forces to withdraw from eastern Europe and to return to 1997 levels of deployment. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Sergei Rybakov, said on Wednesday that Moscow would be satisfied with a unilateral US commitment to vote against Nato membership for Ukraine. Blinken said he did not have a “piece of paper” by way of answer to Russia’s latest security demands, but he appeared to rule out a veto promise over Ukraine’s future, saying closing Nato’s doors to new members was an “absolute non-starter”. US officials have described the Kremlin military buildup as extremely dangerous, with the White House spokesperson Jen Psaki saying an onslaught could happen at any time. Asked what Russia might do next, Blinken said: “I can’t read Vladimir Putin’s mind.” But he pointed out that Russia’s president had a long history of aggressive behaviour. This included attacking Georgia in 2008 and annexing Crimea in 2014, and “training, arming and leading” a separatist rebellion in eastern Ukraine. Blinken added: “We have to base our actions on the facts.” After Kyiv, Blinken is due to travel to Berlin for talks with German and European allies. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said relations with the US were advancing at “Formula One speed”. He acknowledged Russia was refusing to negotiate with his government directly, saying: “Mr Lavrov is avoiding me.” Russia has brushed off calls to withdraw its troops from the Ukrainian border by saying it has a right to deploy its forces wherever it likes on its own territory. It also has rejected US allegations that it is preparing a pretext to invade Ukraine. Lavrov dismissed the US claim of a Russian “false-flag operation” as “total disinformation”. Speaking at a meeting of the Valdai discussion club, Ryabkov repeated Moscow’s denials it had plans to attack Ukraine. “I am confident that there is no risk of a large-scale war that could break out in Europe or somewhere else. We do not intend to take any aggressive steps,” he said. “We have no intention of attacking, staging an offensive on or invading Ukraine.” Ryabkov said Moscow would not consider an informal moratorium on Ukraine’s entrance into Nato sufficient. “If the US assumes a unilateral legally binding commitment that it will never vote in favour of admitting Ukraine and other countries to Nato, we will be ready to consider this option. It would be an easier path for the US,” he added. Meanwhile, Russia continued its deployment of military assets from its far east to the borders of Ukraine. Open source researchers said on Wednesday they had identified elements of a BM-27 Uragan rocket artillery launcher in Belarus about 200km (125 miles) from Kyiv. The deployment of heavy rocket artillery so close to the Ukrainian capital could further increase fears that the plans for joint exercises could provide cover for a Russian-led advance that could quickly engulf Kyiv and its government. On Wednesday Russia’s defence ministry released fresh details of the joint exercises, which are set to begin next month and continue until 20 February. Russia was planning to deploy 12 Sukhoi Su-35 air defence fighters to Belarus for the exercises, along with S-400 and Pantsir anti-air defence systems, the ministry said in a statement. The Biden administration has promised to boost military assistance to Ukraine in the event of a Russian operation, but has ruled out sending troops. On Wednesday Blinken said military support was continuing, with deliveries last year at their highest level since 2014. The US has also been supplying Ukraine with classified intelligence. The CIA director, William Burns, visited Kyiv last week and shared its risk assessment with Zelenskiy’s cabinet, a US official said. Ended negotiations with @SecBlinken.

1/20/2022,"Prof Julia Sinclair is one of the most thoughtful doctors I have ever known (Millions in UK drinking harmful levels of alcohol at home, experts warn, 17 January). She reports a change to longer sessions of drinking in many more people during the pandemic. That is a sobering judgment. An alarm really rang for me, in relation to hospital care, when Sinclair said that there have been more patients going into “delirium tremens”, because that is an indication of alcohol dependence. For vulnerable people who are now drinking too much, introducing changes to the alcohol culture, such as Scotland’s minimum unit price, would pull some back from the cliff of addiction. But for those who have became dependent, clinical care and community support are essential for recovery. In the past 50 years, I have seen too many lives distorted by alcohol-related diseases to accept an extra 2m cases in the next decades as inevitable.  The new integrated care systems will need to plan and mobilise services for this vulnerable section of the population and offer better support to their families and employers.Prof Woody CaanFormer chair, special interest group for alcohol, Faculty of Public Health  Zoe Williams is right to point out that the tolerance of alcohol consumption at work has declined, if not disappeared, in recent times (Office drinking culture slowed down in the 90s. But not for journalists – and now they are running the country, 18 January). But even in the days of employees routinely going to the pub at lunchtime, they would have been paying for their drinks. One has to assume that Boris Johnson’s “wine-time Fridays” and other boozy shindigs were not all BYOB events, but were paid for out of expenses – in other words, by you and me.Isabella StoneSheffield  I must dispute Zoe Williams’s statement that “a couple of pints at lunchtime, even in reputable careers such as teaching, was still commonplace in the 80s”. My husband and I began teaching in 1968 and, in our 40 years of working in a variety of schools, never saw workplace drinking. In the 1980s, my husband was deputy head of one of the largest comprehensive schools in the country. If anyone had been drinking he would have known, but it did not happen. Most teachers could not find time for a decent lunch and a cup of tea.Catherine KingPalau-del-Vidre, France  It was not only journalists who enjoyed a workplace drinking culture during the 1990s. As a civil servant in London in the 1980s, I often felt obliged to partake in long working lunches. And I would swear on oath that this way of doing business persisted into the 1990s after I moved to Cardiff. But things gradually sobered up as more enlightened management in Wales brought staff to their senses and alcohol-free ways of working were adopted.Mike PenderCardiff  How fascinating that as a town councillor we have a rule that there must be no alcohol at meetings and even that “meetings shall not take place in premises which at the time of the meeting are used for the supply of alcohol”.

1/20/2022,"I am a composer of classical music. My pieces have featured on Radio 3 since about 1971, have been performed by BBC orchestras and have appeared in many BBC Proms. My initial reaction to Nadine Dorries’s assault on the corporation (Report, 17 January) was a sinking feeling that this was the end of the line for British music. On reflection, I realise it is worse than that. It is an attack on culture itself – an attempt to categorise as elitist anything except the most trivial commercial pap, and to brand as leftist any journalism that holds the government to account. It is a race to the bottom. The founding principles of Lord Reith were precisely the opposite: entertain the public and elevate them by treating them as equals and giving them the best of human thought and endeavour.  Even more important than the destruction of British music and the devastation of the livelihoods of many hundreds of musicians, it is the BBC’s tradition of fearless, impartial reporting that is at stake. The government hates its actions being scrutinised. It hates noisy demonstrations – even when they are addressing environmental issues that have been ignored by governments – and is doing what narrow-minded, authoritarian governments have always tried to do: move against any organisation that speaks truth to power. If we allow this government to destroy the BBC (as we allowed it to cast us adrift from Europe on a raft of populist lies), we shall have no one to blame but ourselves.Giles SwaynePreston on Wye, Herefordshire  Your editorial (17 January) is spot-on.

1/20/2022,"Ghislaine Maxwell’s legal team was poised on Wednesday to file detailed documents requesting a new trial following revelations that a juror may not have disclosed childhood sexual abuse during jury selection. Maxwell, the daughter of the late British publishing baron Robert Maxwell, was convicted on 29 December of five counts for facilitating the late financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of girls, some as young as 14.  After last year’s trial, one panelist, juror No 50, said in an interview that he was a victim of childhood sexual abuse. This juror, Scotty David, reportedly said he told fellow jurors about his experience – and that this helped other panelists understand things from a victim’s point of view. David’s statements about prior abuse spurred questions, given that potential jurors completed questionnaires during the selection process which included: “Have you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” The questionnaire also asked: “Witnesses in this case may testify claiming sexual abuse or sexual assault. Would you have any difficulty assessing the credibility of a witness claiming sexual assault or abuse just like you would any other witness?” David reportedly said that he did not recall the question about abuse but had answered every query honestly. Following David’s comments, prosecutors asked judge Alison Nathan to investigate his remarks. “While the court instructed jurors that they were free to discuss their jury service with anyone of their choosing, some of the statements, as related in the media, merit attention by the court. In particular, the juror has described being a victim of sexual abuse,” prosecutors wrote in a 5 January letter. “Assuming the accuracy of the reporting, the juror asserted that he ‘flew through’ the prospective juror questionnaire and does not recall being asked whether he had been a victim of sexual abuse, but stated that ‘he would have answered honestly’. “Based on the foregoing, the government believes the court should conduct an inquiry,” they wrote to Nathan. Maxwell’s legal team, in turn, said the juror’s published comments necessitated a retrial. Epstein, who counted Prince Andrew and former US presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump among his many high-profile acquaintances, was arrested in July 2019 for sex trafficking girls as young as 14. He killed himself in a Manhattan jail about one month later, while awaiting trial. Prince Andrew has faced increasing scrutiny over his relationship with Epstein and Maxwell following her high-profile trial. He is also being sued by Virginia Giuffre, who claims that Epstein and Maxwell forced her into sex with the royal in London at age 17. He has denied the allegations. Despite his denials, fallout has been intense. Buckingham Palace said in a statement last week: “With the Queen’s approval and agreement, the Duke of York’s military affiliations and royal patronages have been returned to the Queen. The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen.”",News/US news,Ghislaine Maxwell to file request for retrial over juror’s revelation,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/19/ghislaine-maxwell-request-retrial-juror-revelation
1/20/2022,"Two weeks ago the Fiver had never heard of Comoros, which we’ve since learned is the fourth-smallest nation in Africa. And while our ignorance might seem kinda condescending, the world’s most daily football email would like to assure the 850,000 or so inhabitants of this four-island archipelago our ignorance is entirely down to a school geography syllabus that was more focused on the excruciating minutiae of what constitutes a truncated spur, than anything so useful as the names and whereabouts of all the countries in the world.  Nicknamed “Cloud Coup Coup Land” in some quarters, due to the 20 or so heads of state who have been ousted from office since its declaration of independence from France in 1975, Comoros staged one of the most seismic and audacious bloodless coups in international football history on Tuesday, knocking the star-studded four-times champions Ghana out of the Africa Cup of Nations. The Roumdé Adjia Stadium in Garoua was the venue for a thriller that ended with the plucky Coelacanths – a team of minnows who take their nickname from a comparatively massive fish that can unhinge its mouth to devour very large prey – performing an impressive giant-killing of their own. Boasting big name stars such as Thomas Partey, Daniel Amartey and the Ayew brothers in their line-up, Ghana had been expected to breeze into the last 16 despite a slow start in Group C. In a game that started badly for them and went quickly downhill, they were hamstrung by the early double whammy of going a goal down and losing André Ayew to what looked a slightly harsh red card. Shortly after the hour mark, Comoros increased the deficit to two. Despite Ghana rallying gamely to level the scores with 13 minutes to go, the team ranked 132nd in the world by Fifa delivered the knockout blow on 85 minutes, leading to scenes of delight in the Comoros dressing room. This jubilation was nothing compared to that on show in the home of Mikel Arteta and assorted Arsenal fans, who can now look forward to having Partey back in their side at the weekend, having not missed a single Premier League game while he was away. “This is something special – this victory is historic,” said Ahmed Mogni, who chipped in with two goals for Comoros. “When we open the history books in the next couple of years, it will be all these players who will be inside. It’s very important for me and for my team because we showed that we have the quality to compete with the big nations in Africa. Also this victory is very important for us because we continue to believe and hope that we can pass this group stage for the next round.” While Comoros’s hopes of advancing to the Afcon knockout stages as one of the best third-placed group sides are extremely slim with three groups still to be decided, anyone with a passing interest in world football will be praying they make it.

He’ll be badly missed.” Brighton have warned supporters they face indefinite bans and further police action if they enter the pitch, following incidents at the club’s recent home games against Crystal Palace and Chelsea.

Everton have asked Duncan Ferguson to step in as caretaker manager. The Toffees will take their sweet time to appoint a new permanent head coach after the apparently unforeseeable sacking of Rafa Benítez. Ralf Rangnick has further endeared himself to Manchester United fans by suggesting Paul Pogba might play better now there are potential suitors to impress. “He will be highly motivated,” Rangnick cheered, “and why should I then not play him?” Newcastle continue to carry the January transfer window, and are currently waving £30m under the noses of Sevilla in a bid to buy Brazilian centre-back Diego Carlos. Dani Alves has a simple solution for solving Barcelona’s malaise: buy Lionel Messi. “Messi is the best player in the history of football,” Alves drooled. “It would be very good if he finishes his career here … the club could take care of it.” Allow him to be Frank: Brentford manager Thomas is open to a potential move for Christian Eriksen. “If players fit the criteria of no d!ckheads, they can play for us,” said the Dane, a motto that has served the Bees well since 2019.

1/20/2022,"Jimmy Kimmel lamented the egregiously low vaccination rate in the US on Tuesday evening, citing a study that found it had the second lowest rate (66%) of the 15 countries tracked. “It’s almost like people here are getting bad information from someplace, you know?” Kimmel said. “The only country below us is Russia (49%), which is kinda nice – our countries haven’t been on the same page since like Rocky fought Drago.”  The survey also found that 6% of Americans say they’re “planning” to get the vaccine. “OK, when?” Kimmel wondered. “The vaccine’s been out for more than a year! How busy could you be, really?” Meanwhile, as part of its evolving Covid strategy at home, the Biden administration on Tuesday unveiled its website for free Covid tests, promising four free tests per household, “which is great news for people who live alone and literally no one else,” Kimmel mused. “What if you have a family of five? Do you start ranking your children?” “Free Covid tests by mail, what a great idea – if this was a year ago,” he added. The site, CovidTests.gov, claims to ship requested tests within seven to 12 days. “Biden’s original plan was you send in a bunch of cereal box tops, but that didn’t work, and now he’s on to this.” We’re all now able to receive at-home Covid tests from the government immediat…in 7-12 days! pic.twitter.com/ojuNNNQRn7 On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah also reacted to the launch of the White House’s free Covid tests website: “just as soon as the Omicron wave is over.” “I mean, it’s great that tests are finally going to be available for everyone, but seven to 12 days? You don’t think that’s a little too long? In a pandemic? I mean, every day is precious. Every single day is precious in a pandemic – if anyone should know that, it’s Joe Biden. “I can’t help but think that if America just took a military approach to Covid, this testing thing would be solved [snaps fingers] like that,” Noah continued. “Because there’s no delays when it comes to the American military. America doesn’t need bombs, and then starts building them. America always has bombs ready to go! “If America wants to drone someone, no one is like ‘OK, we can place the order now and then we wait seven to 12 days, unless there’s a holiday, then in that case …’” he added. “It’s just boom! That terrorist is gone, baby. What? It was just a family? Well boom, they’re still gone! I stand by my boom.” “If America was that proactive when it comes to pandemics, we would’ve all gotten these tests months before Omicron even got here,” he concluded. Not that you could trust Americans to know how to handle the tests well. “We’re just going to test ourselves for antigens?” he joked. “Is that before or after we mess up the directions on an Easy Mac?” And on the Late Show, Stephen Colbert checked in on Democrats’ voting rights legislation, mired by a GOP filibuster in the Senate. The chamber’s Democrats plan to press ahead this week with an effort to pass the legislation, even though it appears, according to the New York Times, “all but dead”. “Come on, guys, don’t give up the fight! Do not get discouraged – in the Senate, there are a lot of things that appear all but dead,” Colbert said, cutting to a photo of Mitch McConnell, Chuck Grassley and other elderly senators. Democrats plan to push ahead with a vote anyway to put on record who’s for and against voting rights. “That’s right, because once you know which politicians are keeping you from being able to vote, you can vote them out – and, I see the problem. That’s a toughie,” Colbert quipped. The GOP filibuster of critical voting rights protection has drawn the ire of even musician Stevie Wonder, who this week released a scathing YouTube video calling on Republicans senators to “cut the bull-tish.” “I want to thank Stevie Wonder for standing up for democracy and swearing in a way I can air on my CBS television show,” Colbert saluted. “You, sir, are one bad mother-trucker.” “Senators, you know how hard it is to make Stevie Wonder that angry?” he added. “The meanest thing he’s ever said up till now is ‘you’re just my part-time lover.’”",Arts/Culture,"Jimmy Kimmel on White House’s free Covid tests: ‘Great idea, if this was a year ago’",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/19/jimmy-kimmel-white-house-free-covid-tests
1/20/2022,"As the number of Covid cases in Australia has become impossible to accurately determine using test and case numbers alone, epidemiologists say it is crucial to undertake population-wide surveys to understand both current levels of infection and cumulative past infections. John Kaldor, a professor of epidemiology at UNSW’s Kirby Institute, and his colleagues at other organisations conducted seroprevalence surveys in 2020 and 2021. They are hoping to conduct repeat surveys this year to better understand the spread of the Omicron outbreak. “Antibodies can fade, but people probably have some detectable antibodies at least six months after infection,” he said.  “We are hoping to conduct some repeat surveys during the course of this year, but there are a range of approvals we need first.” Serology testing involves taking a sample of a person’s blood to look for antibodies against the Covid virus. The presence of the antibodies indicates a person has been previously infected, vaccinated or both. By taking a large enough number of blood samples from a diverse cross-section of people, this data can be extrapolated to provide a snapshot of the percentage of a population who have been infected and have some immunity. Kaldor said it would also be important to follow the UK and conduct regular random household surveys to ask people about their recent symptoms, and to undertake home swab testing. This would also detect asymptomatic cases and provide a clearer understanding of current infections. Fiona Russell, a professor of paediatrics and epidemiology at the University of Melbourne, said seroprevalence studies cannot be done “overnight” and there were particular challenges in collecting a representative sample in Australia. “There’s practical, logistical and feasibility issues around having a representative sample. For example, making sure you include people who live in regional areas, and then getting consent, collecting their blood … To do all of that you need funding,” she said. “It takes time, but it can and must be done.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In the meantime, Russell believes states with widespread Covid cases, including Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales should conduct mini “rapid” seroprevalence surveys. “It would involve examining blood that has already been taken and stored, for example from people who might have come into hospital for an operation, or had their blood taken for another reason,” Russell said. “You could do it by postcode, or by age, to get a quick look at what is happening in a certain age group or area.” Seroprevalence surveys can help estimate the level of immunity in a population, but are different to determining the incidence of the virus – that is, the rate of new cases of the virus being detected each day or week. When Australia had low case numbers and widely available and accessible testing with fast results, it was easier to estimate with higher confidence the number of people with an active case of the virus at any one time. While cases are always underestimated – even during small outbreaks – the sheer number of people now unable to be tested, asymptomatic people, or tests never being analysed in the laboratory due to lengthy delays from the time of collection means overall test numbers and positive cases from those tests are less accurate in understanding incidence in the population. Nonetheless, Kaldor said efforts were being made to provide estimates of incidence by using a mixture of data, surveys of testing behaviour, and modelling tools. Key pieces of information will be the proportion of people undertaking rapid antigen tests and actually reporting their results. “The epidemiological and modelling community is working on methods to make adjustments to correct for levels of testing in different parts of the population, and how to do that is still an area of discussion,” he said.",News/Australia news,"Blood test surveys crucial to estimate Covid spread in Australia, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/20/blood-test-surveys-crucial-to-estimate-covid-spread-in-australia-experts-say
1/20/2022,"It’s not easy to quantify the cost of the Omicron wave to Carolyn Campbell-McLean, but here’s a good starting point: $1,300. That is how much she says she has spent on rapid antigen tests since Australia’s PCR testing system began to falter.  There have been other costs too: Campbell-McLean paid the price for the December PCR testing debacle when she couldn’t find a Covid-negative carer to help her get into bed on New Year’s Eve; and she has not left the home she shares with her husband, who also has a physical disability, since 15 December due to the spike in cases. But the cost to Campbell-McLean just to keep herself safe is perhaps neatly summed up in that figure of $1,300. “I’ve spent $1,300 of my own money on Rat tests so I can make sure my carers do them before they come in,” Campbell-McLean said. “The NDIS has not allowed me to claim that money. If I was living in a group home, the staff at the group home and their agencies that runs those homes are … able to claim this money. “People who support ourselves in our own home … are not able to claim that. I think that’s really unfair.” Campbell-McLean, 47, lives in western Sydney with spinal muscular atrophy, a form of muscular dystrophy, and sleeps with a Bipap machine, which is a type of ventilator. She cannot blow her nose by herself, nor cough. Last month, when Scott Morrison pushed back against calls for universal rapid antigen tests because Australia was at “another stage of this pandemic … where we can’t just go round and make everything free”, it’s unclear whether he meant people like Campbell-McLean were expected to spend hundreds of dollars on the tests. But, according to Campbell-McLean, the current policy settings means that is her reality. Campbell-McLean said she needed the tests to safely allow her support workers into her home. And without those workers, she cannot get out of bed in the morning, get dressed, have a shower or go to the toilet. The prime minister has also differentiated between aged care and health settings, where free tests are available, and so-called “casual” uses of rapid antigen tests, which he’s argued are “what the private market is for”. Where people with disability like Campbell-McLean are supposed to fit into that picture is unclear, though a department spokesperson indicated increased access to rapid antigen tests for the disability sector was being worked on. Campbell-McLean is not alone. Guardian Australia is aware of another family who has already spent about $1,000 on rapid tests to provide to staff caring for a man with motor-neurone disease. “I’ve taken what I think is personal responsibility,” Campbell-McLean said. “I’ve stopped going out to things, and not putting myself at risk. But I can’t survive without support workers coming in and helping me go to the toilet. “Everyday they report numbers and they say, ‘That person had an underlying medical condition.’ That doesn’t make it OK that they died.” Campbell-McLean’s team of seven support workers take a rapid tests before most, though not all, shifts. She will normally have three to four care visits a day from different workers. Campbell-McLean noted she was lucky to have obtained as many rapid tests as she did, and that she had the savings to buy them. Some she bought online, though they haven’t all arrived, while a local chemist also provided what Campbell-McLean called “his personal supply”. She said she expected this supply to be used up by the end of the month. Before PCR testing was overwhelmed, Campbell-McLean’s support workers underwent those tests regularly, but the long wait times – both to get tested and to receive the results – have made this unworkable. April Purdon, 19, is one of Campbell-McLean’s support workers and considers her a friend. “It’s been hard, we’ve gotten very close over the time,” Purdon said of the past two years. Ideally, Purdon said, rapid tests would easily accessible, or even free, so the support workers wouldn’t have to ration them. “I’d take one before every shift, so I wouldn’t have to worry about the stress or the guilt,” Purdon said. “[Campbell-McLean and her husband] are worried about it, and that makes me worried … That’s the thing, home support: you’re really bringing it into their home, their safe place.” The chief executive of Muscular Dystrophy NSW, Charlotte Sangster, who employs Campbell-McLean, warned people with muscular dystrophy had a restricted lung capacity and were “particularly vulnerable” to a “really poor outcome” if they caught Covid. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Campbell-McLean summed up the situation this way: “[The doctors have] said don’t get it. My lungs are a third the capacity of an average person. “That’s why I am on a ventilator at night. I can’t independently blow my nose, I need assistance to cough. I don’t want to get the virus, I don’t feel I would do well with it.” Advocates argued Campbell-McLean’s situation was emblematic of frustrations within the disability community that too often it had been forgotten in the pandemic response. Campbell-McLean is among the estimated 18% of NDIS participants excluded from the government’s scheme to provide 10 free rapid tests over three months. That’s because she does not hold an eligible concession card. “There is a subset of people here that don’t necessarily fit the pension group, who need to have enough rapid antigen tests to keep themselves alive and healthy and don’t necessarily have the funds to do it,” said Serena Ovens, the chief executive of the Physical Disability Council of NSW, who described the situation as “mind-boggling”. “I think the government needs to stump up.” The national disability insurance agency has limited its offering of rapid antigen tests to participants and providers in supported independent living, often called group homes. Of the 480,000 NDIS participants in the scheme, about 25,000 participants are able to claim the costs of those tests. Meanwhile, the peak body for disability providers has had its calls to gain access to the national stockpile of rapid tests, as occurs in aged care, rebuffed. The opposition NDIS spokesperson, Bill Shorten, said rapid tests should be free. He described Carolyn’s story as “heartbreaking”. A department of social services spokesperson said the department was “working with the department of health to support access to rapid antigen tests for the disability sector, as the supply increases”. A spokesperson for the NDIS minister, Linda Reynolds, pointed to recent announcements in NSW and Victoria to “supply rapid antigen tests to disability settings”. The Victorian government announcement referred broadly to “essential workers” in disability services, but the NSW statement referred only to those in supported independent living, which is separate to Campbell-McLean’s situation. The spokesperson added there were free PCR tests in state and territory clinics “with significant reductions in testing times across all jurisdictions”. An NDIA spokesperson said the agency continued to “review measures relating to Covid-19 on an ongoing basis to determine what changes are needed to safely deliver supports and services”, in accordance with “advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee”.",News/Australia news,"Woman living with muscular dystrophy forced to spend $1,300 on rapid antigen tests for in-home carers",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/20/woman-living-with-muscular-dystrophy-forced-to-spend-1300-on-rapid-antigen-tests-for-in-home-carers
1/20/2022,"It’s hard to know the moment Australia’s response to Covid turned from purposeful to a parody, but it was probably when economics trumped health advice. First there was the mid-December declaration by Dominic Perrottet to leave mask use to “personal responsibility” and discourage curbs on the movement of the unvaccinated just as the Omicron variant took off.  Then there was Wednesday’s sirenic call by prime minister Scott Morrison to the 150,000 international students with visas. Not because we want them to be here studying courses they pay over the odds for. Rather, it would be “incredibly helpful” if they filled “critical workforce shortages”, not least in “healthcare, aged care, those types of sectors”, the PM said. Now the NSW government is considering waiving “responsible service of alcohol” certificates as a priority because what we lack most right now is sufficient booze flowing in our pubs. Any humour, though, would probably be viewed darkly by Sydney paramedics who recently picked up a 93-year-old woman with a broken hip who had been waiting 13 hours for an ambulance. Or the surgeons at the city’s Liverpool hospital who cancelled cancer operations this week because there wasn’t a spare ICU bed if patients suddenly required one. With economics in the ascendancy, policymakers are relying on the health sector bending but not breaking. Draconian threats of retribution against those who speak out may help to cauterise the public debate, leaving empty supermarket shelves or deported tennis stars to dominate headlines rather than the images or appeals of patients or carers in distress. Our political leaders may also take heart from early signs that the hit to consumer and business sentiment from what independent economist Saul Eslake calls Australia’s “voluntary lockdown” will be short lived. True, confidence in January may be the lowest in 15 months – and at a nadir not seen in this typically cheery month since 1992 – according a ANZ-Roy Morgan survey. But another reading of sentiment by the Westpac-Melbourne Institute, released on Wednesday, points to only a modest retreat so far, although anxiety gathered pace during the period covered by the survey last week. Eslake says there’s few hard numbers since Omicron really took off. Still, Google and Apple mobility data signal people are sharply reducing their movements, presumably as they try to avoid being infected or because they or close contacts have been, and they are restricted from venturing to work or to shop. That’s bad news for the hospitality and tourism trade. “The economic impact to the extent that it’s going to get measured is probably bigger on the supply side than on demand side,” he says. “The economic consequences of people not being able to go to work are probably greater than the impact of people being afraid of going out and spending.” Households have become adept at finding ways to work and spend from home, which should provide some economic ballast. So, too, will their hoard of some $220bn in savings accumulated during the past two years. Those supply impacts are not to be sniffed at. According to the US Federal Reserve, that nation’s central bank, Omicron varies from previous Covid waves in its rattling of supply chains, stoking inflationary rather than deflationary pressures. Similar effects are playing out in Australia, Eslake says. Moves to fill our staff shortages by cutting Covid-positive isolation times from 14 days to seven and soon – if comments from the Morrison government are any guide – to five will increase the risk of further spreading the virus. “I don’t have the [epidemiological] expertise to know whether that’s the optimal trade off or not, but it obviously is a trade off,” he said. Richard Denniss, chief economist at The Australia Institute, is more blunt. “Letting people that are at high risk of having or spreading the infection return to work quickly helps the labour supply this week, and harms the labour supply in the coming weeks when it spreads,” Denniss said. “So this is the definition of short-termism.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It’s also reverse of the health advice that governed Australia’s pandemic response for the first 18 months. “We are so desperate at the moment, that we are willing to trade off an extra nurse today or an extra truck driver today at the cost of three or more absent in a week or two’s time,” he says. “So, we now have a Covid-induced labour supply problem.” The Doherty Institute modelling presented to national cabinet in late 2021 warned of 200,000 cases a day in a worst-case scenario, according to reports last month. The modelling assumed only baseline public health safety measures and partial contract tracing, the Sydney Morning Herald reported at the time. The institute is now mulling whether to formally release their assessment.Doctors warn privately the return to school of children from the end of next week – although Queensland has delayed the restart for two weeks – will contribute to another wave of patients. Not many will be children – although most remain unvaccinated – but rather infected parents, grandparents or teachers.

When governments ditched health advice, the public might have assumed they had readied carefully honed policies to accommodate the surge in hospital cases, or had fallback measures to flatten that famous infections curve if need. Instead, what’s being revealed “is the opposite of planning”, Denniss bemoans. “Hope is not a strategy.”",News/Australia news,‘The opposite of planning’: how Australia put the economy before health of the nation | Peter Hannam,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/20/the-opposite-of-planning-how-australia-put-the-economy-before-health-of-the-nation
1/20/2022,"Since its debut in 1993, the Triple J Hottest 100 has become a minor national obsession: the subject of intense scrutiny, widespread coverage and constant social media chatter. This year’s countdown – which will air on Australia’s youth broadcaster this Saturday – is no different: with a Justin Bieber and Kid Laroi collaboration tipped as a favourite to win, along with Olivia Rodrigo and Billie Eilish, conversations about Triple J’s playlisting of mainstream pop music have been reignited – while last year’s firestorm over an allegedly ageist tweet from the station still looms in the minds of many.  If you haven’t been paying much attention over the past 12 months, or need a refresher before tuning in, here’s a form guide to help you through Saturday’s countdown. There’s a pleasing – or, depending on who you ask, galling – consistency to the habits of Hottest 100 voters, despite the music that gets released each year. For example, Eilish, winner of the 2019 Hottest 100 with Bad Guy, put out an album last year, so you can expect its biggest single, title track Happier Than Ever, to appear somewhere in the upper echelons of the countdown. Transformative and vaguely novelty Like A Version covers tend to do well too – for instance, DMA’s cover of Cher’s Believe (No 6 in 2016), and Alex Lahey’s cover of My Chemical Romance’s Welcome to the Black Parade (No 83 in 2020) – so it won’t be a surprise if the Wiggles’ cover of Tame Impala’s Elephant works its way up there. The website 100 Warm Tunas, which analyses Hottest 100 voting data from social media posts, actually has the kids’ group tipped for No 1. And perennial Hottest 100 favourites like Gang of Youths, Rüfüs Du Sol, Ball Park Music and Dope Lemon each released a swag of singles in 2021 – so keep an ear out for each of them. Nearly a decade after Taylor Swift’s Shake It Off was banned from entry into the countdown, it would seem that Triple J’s purview has changed – a lot. This year, the Hottest 100 is expected to feature an onslaught of Swift-level pop megastars of the kind you’d ordinarily hear on commercial radio. Laroi and Bieber’s collaboration Stay is tipped to take out the countdown, with tracks by behemoth Rodrigo, e-girl queen Doja Cat, and Eilish not far behind. 100 Warm Tunas also includes tracks by Halsey, Peach PRC, Lil Nas X, Bruno Mars and Lizzo on its prediction list. It’s easy to balk at this pop invasion, but you could argue that the countdown has always favoured mainstream stars: many past winners – including Glass Animals, Eilish, Kendrick Lamar, Angus & Julia Stone, Mumford & Sons, Kings of Leon and Muse – were all already major-label stars with huge international fanbases when they topped their respective countdowns. Despite the alternative veneer, their cheques were still being drawn from the same well as Swift’s. There’s plenty to be said about whether Triple J’s centrist shift is a good or a bad thing but at the very least it’s sure to be an interesting countdown. And if Laroi, a Kamilaroi rapper, does take out the top spot, it’ll be a historic one, too: he’ll be the first First Nations musician to ever reach No 1. Lorde, who made the top 10 in 2013 and 2017, likely won’t crack it this year, after her long-awaited third album Solar Power arrived to an overwhelmingly tepid response. Hottest 100 staples Hilltop Hoods didn’t release anything last year, so they’ll be a notable absence too – as will Flume for the same reason, after featuring in the last two consecutive top fives, he won’t be going for the hat-trick; he didn’t drop last year either. The absence of these heavy hitters, though, means that there could be some room for someone who had a massive 2021 to sneak into the top 20 – like, say, Genesis Owusu or Amyl and the Sniffers, who each released superlative records in the past 12 months. In September last year, Triple J’s Twitter account – which posts in a meme-y, ironic tone – tweeted “did it hurt? when you aged out of the youth radio station”. Backlash ensued from a number of listeners and musicians, including Ainslie Wills, who said that she stopped receiving rotation on Triple J once she turned 30; music journalist and editor Poppy Reid, who pointed out that there was a broader systemic and gendered issue at play; and Jack Colwell, who said that he was once told by the station he was “too old” to be played. did it hurt? when you aged out of the youth radio station Although an undeniably bad look, it might not have been an altogether bad move for the station: it’s no secret that, while its national mandate is to serve 18- to 24-year-olds, its audience tends to skew a little older, and there’s a chance that this mildly scorched-earth post signalled a shift. Still, perhaps the countdown’s winner will be the true judge of where Triple J sits in 2022: with Laroi-stanning Gen Z, or Wiggles-nostalgist millennials.

1/20/2022,"I was initially anxious about kayaking around Australia’s busiest waterway. I cycle to work and Sydney’s roads can be hateful – why would the harbour be any different? While I have kayaked before, I still consider myself a beginner. It takes me back to memories of paddling till my arms fell off at school camp, or capsizing friends on a lazy river as cub scouts. Kayaking as an adult was more of a “fake it till you make it” proposition.  Fortunately, I am in good hands with Sophie Morgan, whose company OzPaddle runs kayaking tours around the city. Morgan says that, in many ways, kayaking is a lot like cycling. With one key difference: less traffic. “There are very few places I wouldn’t recommend to kayak,” she says, adding that in Sydney anywhere east of the Harbour Bridge is ideal, as beyond there the waters do get busier and narrower. As we set out from the Andrew (Boy) Charlton pool, on the eastern side of the Botanic Gardens, the crowded city seems to disappear behind a canopy of trees. Then, as we paddle our way around the bend at Mrs Macquarie’s Chair, the Harbour Bridge and Opera House make a slow, dramatic reveal – framed by towering skyscrapers and blue water. The waters around here, even all the way up to the Opera House, are relatively empty, with only the occasional ferry pushing a small wave from afar. Morgan has been taking kayaking tours out on to Sydney harbour for 12 years now, and she is still energised by the view. “I go to the same place every time and I do not get bored.” The former Iron Woman is a good advertisement for her chosen sport’s fitness benefits. “You’ll get a six-pack,” she jokes as she corrects my paddling technique. The key is to hold the paddle with your arms at 90 degree angles, reaching forward as you paddle so you dip only the fin into the water. By holding the paddle properly, and avoiding pulling past your own body, you get maximal propulsion for minimal effort. Not no effort though. Kayaking is great resistance training for surfers and swimmers, Morgan says. It is also good exercise for those with bad knees – she knows kayakers who keep paddling into their 80s. For beginners, a class like hers, which runs for two hours and is priced at $125 per person, is a good way to learn the ropes. But once you’ve got a handle on the right way to paddle, you can hire a kayak on plenty of large, flat bodies of water around Australia, often for as little as $20 an hour. Morgan does warn beginners off double kayaks though. Even if you plan to paddle alongside someone else, “the divorce rate is lower in singles”. When it comes to buying equipment, Morgan says you get what you pay for. “A good paddle is going to make a lot of difference.” Longer, lighter and stronger gear helps conserve energy, but it comes at a cost. If you are looking to get your own kit, a kayak can cost you as little as $200, or as much as $5,000. Meanwhile paddles can go for as low as $15 and as high as $400; with life jackets as an added expense. Cheaper equipment tends to be shorter and heavier, Morgan says, forcing kayakers to put in more work. As for the best time of day to set out, she says “early morning – it’s always better”. While the middle of the day is both hotter and windier, at dawn it tends to be “more peaceful”. At the end of our paddle together, I’m surprised to find no trace of that school camp feeling. My arms aren’t falling off – instead I’m energised and ready to take on the day. Timing is important, but technique is everything.

1/20/2022,"Australia should build its own network of Earth observation satellites to reduce reliance on foreign satellite data that could be compromised by environmental or geopolitical stressors, scientists say. The recommendation is included in a national 10-year plan for Australian space science, launched on Thursday by the Australian Academy of Science.  Prof Stuart Phinn, director of the Remote Sensing Research Centre at the University of Queensland, said Earth observation satellites were important for weather forecasting and predicting and responding to natural disasters such as the recent volcano eruption in Tonga. “All of our crop production, our food production and grazing also depends on information from satellites for a range of purposes. Our defence forces in their operational planning and responses … depend on information from satellite systems,” Phinn said at a media briefing. The field of space science also has applications in environmental management and GPS navigation and timing technologies. Presently, Australia relies on Japanese geostationary satellites for weather information, as well as data from US and European Space Agency satellites, Phinn said. According to the national plan, “there is no guarantee all necessary data sources will always be freely available … This imposes a sovereign risk, especially if Australia is regarded as an unequal contributor to the global [Earth observation] community.” Building and operating satellites locally would ensure Australia’s independence, Phinn said, adding: “We can contribute back globally as well.” The decadal plan also recommends establishing a national program of space weather research. It warns that Australia’s current capacity “provides around a one-hour warning of major space weather events” that could knock out global aviation and communication. Solar flares – intense explosions in the sun’s atmosphere – can trigger magnetic storms and disrupt satellites, radio communications and radar operations. Emeritus Prof Fred Menk, chair of the AAS’s national committee for space and radio science, said: “I can guarantee that at some point, there’ll be a catastrophic space weather event that will fundamentally damage our infrastructure. “I can’t tell you if that’s going to be next week or in 100 years, and that is because we don’t have the science which allows us to make those sort of predictions accurately.” “What we can do is we can grow our science capability in Australia,” Menk said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The plan also recommends establishing space science as a national research priority, and investment in an ongoing national space program. Menk predicted there would be about 100 missions to the moon in the next decade, as well as other planetary bodies, calling it “a really exciting time to get into interplanetary science, and to see what we can learn about the solar system”.",News/Science,"Building Australian network of satellites would reduce reliance on foreign data, scientists say",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/20/building-australian-network-of-satellites-would-reduce-reliance-on-foreign-data-scientists-say
1/20/2022,"Unprecedented Covid cases in Australia have coincided with surging demand for pulse oximeters, as hundreds of thousands of people manage their infections at home. At-home care guidelines for Covid-19 suggest using pulse oximeters – portable devices worn on the finger – to provide a measurement of oxygen in the bloodstream.  Low oxygen saturation levels may be a warning sign of worsening Covid, and people at higher risk of having their condition deteriorate – such as those who are over 65, pregnant, immunocompromised or Indigenous – may be provided with an oximeter by a local health service. But a run on pulse oximeters has made buying them difficult, with experts saying they aren’t a necessary device for everyone who is Covid positive. President of the Australian Society of Anaesthetists, Dr Andrew Miller, said pulse oximeters were reliable devices often used during anaesthesia and in intensive care. “It’s a bit like a thermometer in that … it’s something that can be used at home by a layperson and get a meaningful result out of it.” The device, which clips painlessly over a fingertip, measures blood oxygen saturation and pulse rate. It works using lights and a sensor that measures the colour of blood, which is brighter red when there is more oxygen in it. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Cheaper oximeters display the measurements as figures, while more expensive models also display a waveform of the pulse in the finger. Some phones and smart watches have a pulse oximeter function, but the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has warned that these “are not accurate and should not be used”. Oximeters can be a useful addition to proper medical care, but not a replacement, Miller said. “We would encourage that they only be used in the context of someone who’s getting clinical support to be at home by either a state hospital-in-the-home service or a general practitioner.” In the absence of an oximeter, breathing rate can be a good proxy, Miller said. “We’re normally breathing about 12 [breaths a minute]. People who are breathing over about 15 to 20 respirations a minute … we start to get concerned.” Dr Suzi Nou, an anaesthetist in Melbourne who has been managing Covid patients in the community said: “If you’re having trouble breathing, if it’s an effort to do things like walk up the stairs, if you’re having trouble talking in a complete sentence and that makes you breathless, if you’ve noticed your lips or fingernail beds are going a little bit blue – they would be very strong signs that there’s not enough oxygen in their body.” For those who are able to source a pulse oximeter: an oxygen saturation of 95% or above is the typical baseline for a healthy person breathing at rest. According to Australian guidelines for people with Covid a saturation level between 92% and 94% at rest is a sign of moderate disease. “In a non-pandemic world, if I had a patient who is otherwise fit and healthy and a bad chest or viral chest infection with saturations of 93%, I’d want to be looking into that,” Nou said, adding that people with lung conditions such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis may have a baseline level lower than 94%. “Less than 92%, that is concerning: call an ambulance. Definitely seek medical attention,” she said. There are certain factors that will help to improve the accuracy of a reading. The devices are affected by movement – such as coughing fits, as well as poor circulation in the fingers. People with acrylic or gel nail polish should rotate the oximeter on their fingertip – so that it clips over the skin instead of the nail. Concerns have also been raised about the accuracy of the devices in people with darker skin pigmentation. Earlier this month, the Therapeutic Goods Administration warned that pulse oximeters could overestimate oxygen levels in people with darker skin tones – meaning that low oxygen levels had the potential to be missed in these populations. “If a state health system was rolling these things out, they need to make sure that they’re using one that’s been validated across ethnicities,” Miller said. Nou said the jury was still out on how significant an effect skin tone had on oximeter accuracy. “I do a lot of work in developing countries with people with darker skin pigment, and I haven’t been too concerned about the accuracy of them,” she said. “The monitoring is there to assist your … observation of the patient. So if I think someone is looking like they’re having trouble breathing and the monitor tells me it’s a great number, I’m always more likely to believe the patient.” Nou said anecdotally people had been struggling to source them for personal use. “I’ve had some patients who have been able to get hold of them, so it is variable,” she said. A spokesperson for the Pharmacy Guild of Australia said members had not reported any noticeable uptick in demand for oximeters since the start of the pandemic. But only one of 10 chemists Guardian Australia contacted in Victoria and New South Wales said they had any in stock. One pharmacy worker at a major chain in Melbourne said they had been out of stock for two weeks and were not sure when a resupply would occur. Another said the products were “quite popular at the moment” and that they hadn’t had any available since Christmas. “Everyone’s been trying to get them,” said a third, while a fourth said their usual wholesale supplier was out of stock.",News/Australia news,What is a pulse oximeter and can I still buy one in Australia?

1/20/2022,"On Thursday the December labour force figures will come out, quite likely showing good news. The latest payroll job index released on Wednesday covers the same period – up to the week ending 18 December – and it revealed better numbers than in November:  If the graph does not display please click here While the range of numbers from the best performing state or territory (WA), to the worst (ACT), remains relatively large, overall things looked to be returning to normal after the lockdowns in the second half of 2021 in NSW, Victoria and the ACT. And to be honest, even with those lockdowns, the job market in 2021 was generally much better than the annus horribilis of 2020: If the graph does not display please click here And so it is quite likely that the December unemployment rate will stay nicely below 5% and we can take a deep breath and relax, realising the worst is behind us. Or maybe not. You see the December labour force figures, like the latest job index numbers, will come from a survey done in the first two weeks of December. So let us check what the Covid case numbers were like then compared with now: If the graph does not display please click here In those first two weeks of December Omicron was decidedly on people’s minds, but the numbers were yet to takeoff. It is a reminder that whatever you may hear about pushing through the virus, things remain so fluid that nearly two years into this pandemic the bureau of statistics is yet to attempt to provide trend numbers for its data because numbers are subject to changes from week to week. The bureau does not even bother to provide seasonally adjusted figures for our international arrivals and departures because even that measure no longer makes sense. And perhaps there is no greater data point for showing just how far we are from normal than the number of people visiting Australia. In November last year the number of people who had arrived in Australia for a short-term stay surged to 20,860, up from just 4,310 people in October. And while a 383% rise may sound big: If the graph does not display please click here In November 2019, when no one had any worries about pandemics and travel was easy, 815,910 people came here for a short-term stay, so we are 98% below that level. Little wonder that yesterday prime minister Scott Morrison and treasurer Josh Frydenberg announced they would be providing a rebate on travel visas for students arriving here over the next eight weeks. And Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced that international travellers to that state will no longer need to isolate so long as they are double vaccinated. But the problem is that both announcements came on the day that the US government advised its citizens “Do not travel to Australia due to Covid-19-related travel restrictions”. That is certainly going to make the latest campaign by Tourism Australia that the Morrison government is allocating an extra $3m to, a tad more tricky. The need for travellers is of course vital. The lack of international tourists is horrendous for the hospitality industry: If the graph does not display please click here In December – and remember that was when things looked better – there were still 10% fewer jobs in accommodation than there were when the pandemic hit in March 2020. While air transport jobs, the worst hit sector in the entire economy, were down a full third. But on the other side of the ledger is the damage the lack of backpackers and international students does to the supply of workers. The halt of international university students especially has seen the number of people in the labour force aged 20-24 fall by approximately 5% – or about 90,000 people: If the graph does not display please click here It’s not that there is no work for those in their early 20s – in fact a higher percentage of those in their early 20s are working now than in the past decade: If the graph does not display please click here But what the government is after is labour that will work in the regions and in jobs with little prospects and often fewer protections. Morrison announced the government will also rebate the visa application fee for backpackers. “My message to them is ‘come on down, come on down now …’,” he said. He suggested that they “join our workforce and help us in our agricultural sector, in our hospitality sector, and so many of the other parts of the economy”. But while it is clear there are regions across the country suffering labour shortages given there are also about 105,000 unemployed people in their early 20s, the concern is not about the push to get more backpackers working here, but that the push is for workers who are more likely to be exploited. While the labour force figures and other economic data are yet to return to normal, what must not return is the plethora of wage theft and abuse directed to those here on short-term visas, all done in the name of curing labour shortages.

1/20/2022,"Though their relationship on the international calendar means the two have always had a connection, the 2023 Women’s World Cup looms particularly large over this year’s AFC Women’s Asian Cup, which kicksoff on Thursday evening when China take on Taiwan at the Mumbai Football Arena. The tournament serves both as the forum to crown a continental champion and for World Cup qualification. Expansion from 24 to 32 nations at next year’s global showpiece event means that five of the 12 competitors in India this month will secure direct qualification, while another two will be able to book places in a 10-team intercontinental play-off for one of three more berths.  While the likes of Japan or South Korea are virtually assured of qualification under the new format, the expansion – along with the withdrawal of North Korea from this year’s cycle – serves to open the door to others. Nations such as Taiwan can dream of a first World Cup appearance since the inaugural event in 1991 or young stars such as Indonesia’s 20-year-old attacker Zahra Muzdalifah targeting a grander stage. Automatic qualification for 2023 as one of its two co-hosts means Australian stakes in the coming tournament, superficially, have been removed; the Matildas have effectively been given a free hit at continental success. Yet in place of this short-term jeopardy looms a need to address a growing sense of unease surrounding the trajectory of the squad. “Off the back of our Olympic campaign, coming fourth, I think there’s a little bit of expectation for us to win this Asian Cup,” said Matildas defender Ellie Carpenter. “We should win this Asian Cup. That expectation is there and it’s good for us, we want to win tournaments, we want to win trophies.” After earning some respite from the cynicism that had marked the early stages of Tony Gustavsson’s tenure thanks to their Olympic run, a lack of progress in addressing the side’s ongoing issues in subsequent friendlies has prompted fresh concern. The US’s visit to Australia in November for a series Gustavsson labelled a “dress rehearsal” for the 2023 World Cup final was, off the field, a fine showcase of the excitement surrounding the Matildas and a demonstration of why international women’s football is the hottest ticket in town; the 36,109 fans that packed into a sodden Stadium Australia for the first game of the series set a new standalone record in Australia. Yet on the pitch, the reigning world champions – despite fielding an understrength side itself undergoing a generational transition – underlined that the defensive and midfield problems first exposed by Germany and the Netherlands in April remained frustratingly present at year’s end. A 3-0 defeat and 1-1 draw in the two games marked the conclusion of a 2021 calendar in which the Matildas won just three of their 16 games and had shipped 37 goals, at 2.31 a game. It must be acknowledged that 24 of those 37 goals were conceded in friendlies in which the coaching staff expressly prioritised the pursuit of experimentation in approach, the blooding of young talent and the development of a mindset that comes with regularly taking one’s lumps against the world’s best sides. Gustavsson reiterated that, though his sides would always play to win, results were a secondary consideration during this nuanced period and that, while not ideal, the short-term pain would pay off in the long run. Moves such as the deployment of 17-year-old Jessika Nash in the centre of defence against the US in the absence of first-choices Alanna Kennedy and Clare Polkinghorne were deemed necessary in the face of a potentially catastrophic lack of depth in youth exposed by a Football Australia study delivered just before Gustavsson’s tenure commenced. This approach lessened the stakes associated with poor friendly performances, but it also significantly raised them for the Asian Cup. When results are placed low on a side’s hierarchy of needs, it can become difficult to determine if a side is going through the necessary pain of finding a bedrock of future success or attempting to erect a foundation on shifting sands of mistaken assumptions and misplaced confidence. To glean reassurances that it’s the former, a noticeable uptick needs to be demonstrated when, to adopt the parlance of the Swedish coach, the side flicks the switch to transition from “preparation mode” to “performance mode”. “When we’re in preparation mode I want to make sure that as many players as possible get the opportunity to experience the Matildas’ environment,” Gustavsson said in announcing his squad for the tournament. “We’ve had 58 players and 13 debutants and that’s what we need to do when we’re in preparation mode. When we go into performance mode it’s all about what’s the best team possible to go and create results in a tournament.” In a practical sense, the indication of this ideological transition has no better example than the return of Aivi Luik to the 23-player squad. The ever-dependable 36-year-old, who had previously retired from international football, is not a pick for the future but should help deliver results now. Gustavsson hinted when announcing his squad that India 2022 has transitioned from being a part of a broader strategy to something approaching a must-win for Football Australia. The Matildas begin their campaign on Friday evening against Indonesia, before facing off against the Philippines on Monday and concluding group play against Thailand late on Thursday. The presence of former coach Alen Stajčić at the helm of the Philippines will add a layer of intrigue, but comfortable progression to the knockout stages should be straightforward. From there, the spotlight will intensify as the Matildas seek to prove they are on a path that can deliver on the grandest stage.",Sport/Football,Focus shifts from performance to results as Matildas eye Asian Cup success | Joey Lynch,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/20/focus-shifts-from-performance-to-results-as-matildas-eye-asian-cup-success
1/20/2022,"We’re all on a never-ending pursuit to perfect the art of good shuteye. Theories abound, so it is easy to find yourself in a maze of advice, mindfulness techniques and mum’s advice about the magic of a cup of warm milk at night.  But one tactic I found ticked all my boxes: reading for just six minutes before you go to sleep. Relaxing your brain in a way that Netflix before bed just can’t, this simple trick has both improved my sleep and put an end to my reading slump. Back in 2009 the University of Sussex conducted research that found reading a book reduced stress levels by 68%, outperforming other activities like going for a walk or having a cup of tea. Researcher and cognitive neuropsychologist Dr David Lewis explained that this is because sustained reading is more than a distraction and instead offers the chance to be engrossed in the author’s imagination and enter an altered state of consciousness that relaxes the brain. Six minutes sounds easy- and it is - so I’ve employed it as my pre-sleep routine. Not only has the theory proved itself for me, but nine times out of 10, I read for much longer, steadily making a dent in the toppling pile of books on my bedside table. In the time I’ve taken up this habit, waking up on the wrong side of the bed has been easily attributed to nights when I have not turned just a few pages. With so many of us glued to a screen before bed out of habit, bingeing a TV show or scrolling through social media, the best thing about this strategy is that anyone can do six minutes. Fighting off the feeling of being too tired, the reward is rediscovering the escapism and inspiration reading gives us. When we hit a reading roadblock, maybe we don’t always need a page-turner to get back into books. Maybe all we need is a routine.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Easy wins: better than a warm cup of milk, read for six minutes before bed for good sleep",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/20/easy-wins-better-than-a-warm-cup-of-milk-read-for-six-minutes-before-bed-for-good-sleep
