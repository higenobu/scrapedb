3/20/2022,"When Parasite won the Oscar for best picture in 2020, it was seen as long-overdue recognition of the mastery of South Korean cinema. Bong Joon-ho’s dark comedy about two families at opposite ends of the country’s social spectrum was the first non-English language production in the 94-year history of the Academy Awards to win in the category. Having watched its neighbour soak up much of the critical acclaim reserved for east-Asian cinema – and TV series – Japan’s moment could come this month with an understated drama from a director many in Hollywood would have struggled to name until recently. Drive My Car, Ryûsuke Hamaguchi’s absorbing epic of grief, connection and art, is the first Japanese film in Oscar history to be nominated for best picture. His adaptation of a short story of the same name by Haruki Murakami – a perennial, but so far unsuccessful, candidate for the Nobel literature prize – was also nominated for best director, best adapted screenplay and best international feature. To put Hamaguchi’s achievement into historical context, the last Japanese film-maker to be nominated for best director was the revered Akira Kurosawa, for Ran, 36 years ago. Hamaguchi’s demanding, protracted work – whose opening credits arrive a full 40 minutes into the three hours – follows Yûsuke Kafuku (Hidetoshi Nishijima), an actor and theatre director who finds solace in female chauffeur Misaki Watari (Tôko Miura) after the sudden death of his wife, Oto. The industry’s awards calendar has augured well for the 43-year-old Hamaguchi, who made his debut as a commercial director just four years ago, having won acclaim for his Tohoku documentary trilogy – co-directed with Ko Sakai – about the human tragedy unleashed by the triple disaster on Japan’s north-east coast in March 2011. Drive My Car won the Golden Globe for best non-English language film in January and best screenplay at Cannes last year. Earlier this month, it secured a Bafta for best film not in the English language. “The more I think about this, the less sure I am,” Hamaguchi said in a recent interview in attempting to explain how his film now stands on the brink of making cinematic history. “But one thing I can say is that this is a very normal movie. It’s about people who have all these different flaws, each trying to have a better life for themselves. Loving someone or something is one way to do that. But when we love someone, one day you lose or separate from that person. “It’s almost like an oxymoron. That’s sort of the normal aspect of this film, that it’s about the loss and gain of love.” Since its release last year, a consensus has formed around Drive My Car as a film for our times. Some of it was filmed during the coronavirus pandemic – it ends with its characters in face masks – and, months after the roaring success of Squid Game, it has surely settled the argument over subtitles. As Phil Hoad wrote in explaining why Drive My Car should win later this month: “This powerful work is the perfect post-pandemic best picture winner, emerging from introspection and trauma with a calm realisation. It steps over Twitter-false dichotomies about blockbusters-v-arthouse with a total sense of absorption in its own purpose. In times like these, it’s art that keeps the motor running.” Hamaguchi is reportedly looking forward to meeting Steven Spielberg and Denzel Washington in Los Angeles, where Drive My Car will vie for best picture with, among others, Jane Campion’s gothic western The Power of the Dog and Kenneth Branagh’s autobiographical Belfast. But he has been quick to recognise Bong’s role as a flagbearer for what is turning out to be a golden age for east-Asian film-makers and actors. A year after Parasite won four Academy Awards in major categories, Nomadland, directed by Chloe Zhao, the Chinese-born film-maker, won three Oscars – including best director – and the South Korean actor, Youn Yuh-jung, won the best supporting actress Oscar for her role in Minari. “I feel that the reason that this film has been accepted around the world is that the actors’ performances and voices are credible,” Hamaguchi said shortly after Drive My Car’s nomination, adding that Bong’s film had smashed through the psychological resistance – and petty preconceptions – that once acted as a barrier to Asian films. “We, the next generation of Asian films, are going through the door that Parasite has opened,” he said.",Arts/Film,"‘It’s just a film about grief and love’, says director of Japan’s first Oscar contender",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/20/drive-my-car-oscar-japan-ryusuke-hamaguchi
3/20/2022,"A London-based anti-Putin campaigner has called on Boris Johnson to freeze the assets of thousands of Russian citizens in the UK in a bid to root out those with ties to the Kremlin. Andrei Sidelnikov said he told the prime minister to impound the property and bank accounts of emigrants with unexplained wealth, connections with the Russian embassy in London, ties to pro-Putin oligarchs, and of those involved in organising cultural events linked to the Russian state. Sidelnikov, a former associate of the former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko who was murdered in London in 2006, said their assets should be confiscated while corruption investigations were conducted, adding that he was compiling a list of suspected Putin supporters that would be shared with the UK government. The opposition activist said his campaign group, Speak Up!, had founded a new project called Revenge, aimed at gathering the names of Russian emigrants who support Vladimir Putin. “From this moment, all the people who supported this criminal regime must answer for this,” said Sidelnikov, who received political asylum in Britain in 2008 after telling officials his life would be in danger if he remained in Russia. “[If we] don’t close such doors for supporters of criminal Putin’s regime then the war will come to our homes.” In a letter sent to Johnson after Russia invaded Ukraine last month, Sidelnikov also called on the UK government to cancel diplomatic relations with Russia, stop granting visas to Russian citizens until stricter immigration checks were put in place, and to push Nato to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. He added that British lawyers and financiers who helped corrupt Russian emigrants should face tougher legal penalties. “In the future, it must be a criminal offence to have relations with Russians who are supporting the fascist regime.” Although the campaigner admitted there was a danger that such action could fuel Russophobia in the UK, he added: “The problem is that there are so [many] Russian citizens who supported Putin’s criminal regime. It’s very difficult to find them because it’s thousands, not 10 or 100, or 700. “The Russian community is very angry about what I’m saying because so many of them have some links with Putin’s regime.” Sidelnikov said that before the invasion of Ukraine he had sent the prime minister a list of 99 Russian citizens living in the UK who supported Putin. Since the invasion, he said, more than 100 names had been added to this database, adding that his organisation would continue to gather information on allegedly corrupt Russian emigrants for the duration of the war. “The plan is to give this not only to UK authorities, but to give this to the authorities in other countries, including the European Union and the US,” he said. The activist said the names included people who had not been publicly identified as Putin supporters. “We know those people who are living here and there are no sanctions on them,” he added. “They are trying to corrupt British society.” He said a task force, consisting of the police, security services, government officials and MPs, should be established to investigate those accused of corruption. Sidelnikov, 46, added that some emigrants in the UK were now pretending that they had never supported the Russian president. “Some people are turning around after all the years they supported his regime, and now they’re putting on their Facebook, oh, we don’t want war, we’re not for war.” The campaigner predicted that Russia would lose the war with Ukraine. But he expected that Putin would retain the presidency for the foreseeable future. “There is no opposition,” Sidelnikov said. “Some of them were killed like my friend Litvinenko. A lot of my friends are in prison now. Some of them escaped from Russia.”",News/Politics,Campaigner urges Johnson to freeze assets of thousands of Russians in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/20/campaigner-urges-johnson-to-freeze-assets-of-thousands-of-russians-in-uk
3/20/2022,"Boris Johnson was not comparing Brexit to the fight by Ukrainians against the Russian invasion when he named the two as examples of people deciding to “choose freedom”, Rishi Sunak has said, calling them “obviously not analogous”. Johnson prompted fury among political leaders in Europe, and opponents in the UK, when he made the comparison on Saturday in a speech to the Conservative spring conference in Blackpool. Saying the world faced a choice “between freedom and oppression”, the prime minister said: “And I know that it’s the instinct of the people of this country, like the people of Ukraine, to choose freedom, every time. “I can give you a couple of famous recent examples. When the British people voted for Brexit, in such large, large numbers, I don’t believe it was because they were remotely hostile to foreigners. It’s because they wanted to be free to do things differently and for this country to be able to run itself.” Asked about the comments, on Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show, Sunak said: “I don’t think those two situations are directly analogous. Clearly, they’re not directly analogous. I don’t think the prime minister was saying they were directly analogous either. “One is a democratic referendum in a country where they were able to debate ideas in peace.” Pressed on why Johnson used the words, the chancellor declined to elaborate, saying: “I don’t think the prime minister did either. Look, people will make up their own minds. I certainly don’t think those two situations are directly analogous, and I don’t think he does either.” Asked if he agreed that the people of the UK, like those in Ukraine, would “choose freedom, every time”, Sunak replied: “I do think people in this country prize their freedom. Of course they do. And there’s lots of different ways they express that, whether it’s through elections, through referendums, and other democratic means.” The Conservative MP Robert Halfon also played down Boris Johnson’s comparison of Brexit to Ukraine’s fight against Russian invasion. Halfon, the MP for Harlow who chairs the education select committee, told BBC Breakfast: “I don’t think it is as big a deal as some people are making out. “The way I see it is the prime minister was saying we’re a vibrant democracy. We’re such a vibrant democracy, we’ve had a referendum. Ukraine wants to be a vibrant democracy and the Russians are trying to stop that.” Asked if he thought the comments were “an insult to every Ukrainian”, he said: “Absolutely not. No, I think the Ukrainians will be looking at what has been done in practice – £200m of aid, as I’ve said, providing them with military support.” Speaking on Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Labour’s Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, called on Johnson to apologise: “It is utterly distasteful and insulting to compare the fight for freedom and the aggression of the Russia state to the decision to leave the European Union. “It is insulting to the Ukrainian people, who are fighting for their very freedom and their very lives, and it is insulting to the British people as well. If the prime minister didn’t mean that analogy he shouldn’t have made it.” Johnson’s remarks caused particular astonishment given that Ukraine has sought EU membership, and because of the suggestion that the EU is a form of tyranny to be escaped from. Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister who led the European parliament in Brexit negotiations, described the comments as “insane”. “Brexit was about undoing freedoms and leaving the EU,” he said. “Ukrainians want more freedom and to join the EU.”",News/Politics,Rishi Sunak defends Boris Johnson from fury over remarks on Brexit and Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/20/rishi-sunak-defends-boris-johnsons-remarks-about-brexit-and-ukraine
3/20/2022,"It started with Christmas. Sarah* was behind on rent and her money wouldn’t stretch, but she didn’t want her children to miss out. She turned to a local lender – “a friend of a friend” – and borrowed £700. She would repay £1,200 in total, broken down into £200-a-month chunks. The interest was steep but with a bad credit score and no relatives she could turn to, she didn’t have many options. “I was desperate,” Sarah, 39, said. “Everything had piled up – rent, bills – and we were living hand to mouth. It was leading up to Christmas and I just knew I couldn’t do it.” At first it went smoothly: the lender would come to her house and collect his £200 each month, scraped together from Sarah’s job in hospitality and universal credit. But when the third repayment was due, he turned. The lender was with two men she hadn’t met before and was demanding all the money. “I said, ‘I can’t pay that. We’ll have nothing left’,” she said. “But he said, ‘That’s not my fucking problem. Do you think I care?’ My heart was on the floor. I didn’t know what to do.” The mother of four is one of thousands across the UK turning to loan sharks – illegal lenders who offer informal loans without paperwork, often at high interest rates. In some cases, they use threats and coercion to get their money back, sending harassing texts, taking bank cards to intercept benefit payments or visiting late at night to demand cash on the spot. Events often turn violent. When Sarah said she couldn’t pay, she was attacked on her doorstep in front of her children. “He started getting aggressive,” she said. “I knew I couldn’t fight him; I had no chance. I ended up screaming, ‘OK, OK’.” She managed to pay the debt - raised to £2,000 due to the “delays” – after handing over her universal credit, selling some possessions and going to the community centre for support. But, two months on, she is traumatised. “Mentally, it has destroyed me,” she said. “The children are scared in their own home. I feel like a terrible mother for what I brought to my door.” The true scale of illegal money lending is not known. While before the pandemic, 310,000 households were thought to be affected, many cases go unreported, according to Cath Williams of the Illegal Money Lending Team. But it is a growing national concern. In recent months, charities and community centres have seen a surge in people asking for help, some of whom turned to loan sharks to pay for school uniforms and food as well as rent and bills. Last month, the Chartered Trading Standards Institute warned that the challenging economic environment had created a “perfect storm” for loan sharks and scammers. And data from Citizens Advice shows a surge in people needing support from food banks, with the charity making 25,441 referrals in January and February 2022 – up 26% on the year before. Referrals for grants for other essentials, such as clothes, are also up 46%, while requests for help with energy debt were up 33%. Esther Iyobebe, a money mentor with the charity Money A+E, which runs community education programmes, said she had heard growing reports of loan sharks in London. “It used to be Wonga. Now it’s an underground movement. They say, ‘Oh, I heard from a friend that you might need help,’” she said. It’s not always cash. In one case, a woman bought a washing machine from an informal dealer on hire purchase and is now being harassed for repayments. “You pay three times over,” she said. “It’s entrapment.” Gerard Woodhouse, chief executive of L6 Community Centre in Everton, said illegal lending was “rife” in Liverpool. “It’s worse here than drug dealing,” he said. “People aren’t borrowing money for drugs, except the odd one. People are borrowing money to survive. It’s electricity, gas, nappies, people needing school uniforms.” The centre has supported 15 people in trouble with loan sharks since the start of the year, he said – compared with 12 for the whole of 2021. Now Woodhouse fears that the rising costs of living – with surging food and fuel prices, energy bills and a national insurance increase coming into effect next month – mean things could be about to get much worse. “People can contact the council for help, but you only get one bite of the cherry,” he said. “They can’t get standard loans and they’re getting bills in by the minute. God help us when April comes.” * Name has been changed",Lifestyle/Money,Violent loan sharks circle as UK families are pushed into debt,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/20/debt-loan-sharks-circle-uk-families
3/20/2022,"The government’s controversial urban congestion fund is pumping tens of millions of dollars more into marginal and safe Coalition seats than strong Labor electorates, a new report has found. The Grattan Institute on Sunday released a damning report examining the way successive governments have used transport spending promises to further their political interests. The report found due diligence was overwhelmingly lacking in transport promises made during election campaigns. At the last election, just one of the 71 Coalition transport promises worth $100m or more was based on a business case approved by Infrastructure Australia. Labor had business cases for just two of the 61 transport funding announcements it made during the same campaign. The report found a “long and bipartisan history” of pork-barrelling transport funding. Since 2004, under two Labor and four Coalition terms of government, the report said there had been a “persistent pattern” of sending more transport dollars to New South Wales and Queensland, states which often decide federal elections. It also found the urban congestion fund – the government’s much-criticised discretionary funding program for roads and carparks – overwhelmingly went to marginal seats. On average, a marginal urban seat received $83m from the fund and a safe Coalition seat received $64m. Safe Labor seats received just $34m on average, the report found. Report author Marion Terrill described pork-barrelling in transport funding as an “arms race”. The quantum being promised by both parties jumped significantly between the last two elections. In 2016, the Coalition promised $5.4bn in transport spending, compared to Labor’s $6.7bn. By 2019, that had jumped to $42bn for the Coalition and $49bn for Labor. Terrill said the federal government should concentrate its efforts on nationally-significant infrastructure, rather than hyper-local projects – roundabouts, overpasses, and carparks, for example. The government should also only fund such nationally significant projects after proper due diligence, she said. “What’s important about transport is that the dollars involved are really big, so when politicians engage in pork-barrelling with transport funding, there’s an awful lot at stake,” Terrill said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “[It also means] infrastructure gets built in places and of types without any real regard to what’s needed, what the priorities should be and whether it’s even worth it to build this stuff in the first place.” The report found there was no effective sanction for pork-barrelling. Ministerial standards can be used, but only at the prime minister’s discretion. Australia’s electoral laws – while prohibiting someone providing, receiving, or offering benefit to influence a vote – do nothing to stop a party promising to spend public money to advance its own political advantage. Criminal sanctions exist for abuse or misconduct of public office, but they are rarely pursued, the report says. “On the other hand, there is plenty of political upside. The louder the media and public criticism of pork-barrelling, the stronger the ‘evidence’ that ministers are delivering for their communities. Indeed, the criticism arguably is the communications strategy: what’s the point of spending millions on a local project if the locals don’t know about it?”",News/Australia news,"Urban congestion funding for Coalition and marginal seats far outstrips safe Labor seats, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/20/urban-congestion-funding-for-coalition-and-marginal-seats-far-outstrips-safe-labor-seats-report-finds
3/20/2022,"Employers across the US have been dealing with a historic shift in labor thanks to the pandemic. We know it as the Great Resignation, and the pundits have been falling over themselves to explain to us why employers are at fault. Now it looks like the Great Resignation may be followed by the Great Regret. There’s no doubt employers have a lot to learn from the unprecedented rate of job turnover. Researchers at the consulting firm McKinsey, for example, say that employees are tired, and many are grieving. “They want a renewed and revised sense of purpose in their work,” write its authors. “They want social and interpersonal connections with their colleagues and managers. They want to feel a sense of shared identity. They want meaningful – though not necessarily in-person – interactions, not just transactions.” Unfortunately, some of us are not sympathetic enough to these needs. So our employees leave. Research firm Gartner says this week that more than 70% of information technology workers are looking to change jobs this year and urges employers to adopt a more “human-centric” work model that includes better working hours, more productive meetings and greater flexibility to reduce this turnover. Then there’s the “low pay, a lack of opportunities for advancement and feeling disrespected at work”, which are the top reasons why Americans quit their jobs last year according to Pew Research in a new study. The study also found “those who quit and are now employed elsewhere are more likely than not to say their current job has better pay, more opportunities for advancement and more work-life balance and flexibility”. But are they? Are all these workers leaving their jobs for new jobs finding that the new jobs are that much better than their old jobs? That their new employers are that much better than their existing employers? Or is it possible that Joe is taking a new job that’s replacing Susan, who left that job for the same reason that Joe is leaving his job? Yes, there’s lots of turnover and lots of people changing jobs. But given the fact that most are likely just swapping these jobs, maybe the problem isn’t all with the employer. Perhaps employees are being a bit naive too. That theory has been given credence by another study released this week by the job search site the Daily Muse. Its study of more than 2,500 workers found that almost three-quarters of them (72%) experienced either “surprise or regret” that the new position or new company they quit their job for turned out to be “very different” from what they were led to believe. Nearly half (48%) of these workers said they would try to get their old job back thanks to a phenomenon that The Daily Muse is calling “shift shock”. “They’ll join a new company thinking it’s their dream job and then there’s a reality check,” the company’s CEO, Kathryn Minshew told FOX Business. “It’s this really damaging phenomenon where people are brand new in our role, and they suddenly realize it’s not at all as advertised.” It’s a cliche but ask anyone who’s been in the workforce for a number of years and they’ll tell you that the grass is often the same color at the new job (and the coffee is just as bad). Much of this confusion is being driven by Gen Z, those generally born after 1995 who make up more than a quarter of the workforce. According to a recent study by career counseling provider Zety, those workers report that the factors that are most appealing in a new job include, of course, a good benefits package (67%). But just as important to them is a company with “values that match their own” (62%), that has a purpose for being that “goes beyond merely making a profit” (61%), offers “plentiful career development and progression opportunities” (59%) and has a “strong brand reputation” (49%). All of these are worthy goals. But right now how many businesses, particularly smaller firms, really offer this? The reality is that unless you’re working for a global giant like Amazon or Google – who, as we all know, have their own drawbacks – most businesses will struggle to meet all these demands. Working for a small business can be rewarding, fun and more flexible than at a larger organization. But in the end, we’re just a business. Let’s admit that our products and services may be vital to the economy, but they’re not that exciting. Our brands are not very well known. Our advancement opportunities are usually limited. We’re offering a job with a paycheck at (hopefully) a nice place to work with (hopefully) nice owners and (hopefully) a good group of fellow workers. It’s quite likely that what we’re offering isn’t too far different from what a worker is getting at their current job. Maybe we as employers aren’t transparent enough about this. Or maybe employees are a little delusional about what to expect from a new employer. Regardless, if this reality isn’t discussed, upfront, then it could lead to unhappiness and regret a few months down the line. And that’s going to be costly both for the worker and their employer.",News/Business,Turns out the Great Resignation may be followed by the Great Regret | Gene Marks,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/20/great-resignation-great-regret-employees-quitting
3/20/2022,"In the 1970s, Hank Balfour, a virologist at the University of Minnesota Medical School, was studying the long-term survival prospects of kidney transplant patients when he noticed that a small proportion of them went on to develop a rare form of cancer known as post-transplant proliferative disorder. He was particularly intrigued when he discovered that almost all of these patients had been infected with a virus called Epstein-Barr or EBV, a curious pathogen that has captivated and puzzled virus-hunters for decades. “EBV can maintain latency within human cells,” says Balfour. “When we began studying it, it seemed that certain people were more prone to difficulties managing the virus immunologically, perhaps due to their genetic makeup, which allows the virus to put a damaging footprint on the immune system, causing long-term problems.” For while “hit-and-run” viruses such as Ebola or Sars-CoV-2 – which invade organs, wreaking havoc in their wake, before leaving the body – tend to make headlines in the virology world, EBV is a classic example of a “hit-and-stay” virus. These infections silently assimilate within the body’s tissues, in such a way that it is nigh on impossible for the immune system to get rid of them; they remain with us for the rest of our lives. Exactly what they do and how they affect our health has long been a mystery, but over the past 40 years, there has been mounting evidence that EBV is not as benign as it may seem. EBV has evolved to coexist with humanity for millions of years, long before the advent of modern humans. It has become adept in hiding in a type of immune cell called B cells, where it stays for decades. Because most of us catch EBV in childhood – more than half of children in England have contracted EBV by the age of 12 – we do not even realise we have it. The only noticeable time when EBV rears its head is when teenagers or young adults become infected or immune-suppressed and develop mononucleosis or glandular fever, an illness associated with extreme fatigue and swollen glands. However, the presence of the virus in our bodies has also been associated with about 200,000 cases of cancer worldwide every year, which develop years after infection. Associations have been made between EBV and Hodgkin lymphoma, as well as cancers of the head, neck and stomach. In particular, it is estimated that about 40% of Hodgkin lymphoma cases in the UK are related to EBV infection, with those who have previously had glandular fever being at a higher risk. EBV has also been associated with a range of autoimmune disorders, from lupus to chronic fatigue syndrome. But while the medical world has known about these links for some time, most doctors have been nonplussed as to what to do about it. The main problem is that EBV infection is ubiquitous – most estimates suggest that the virus is inside 95% of the world’s population. And because EBV-related cancers are relatively rare – fewer than one in 300 cancer cases in the UK, and about 1.5% of cancers globally, are connected to the virus – modern medicine has largely taken the approach of pretending that the problem does not exist. “The problem with EBV is that clinicians don’t want to deal with it, because they don’t really know what to do with it,” says Balfour. “And academic researchers, for some reason, have shied away from EBV, perhaps because of its complexity.” However, this may be about to change. In January, Science published a landmark study that showed overwhelmingly that EBV is implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS), an incurable autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. Scientists, led by Alberto Ascherio from the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health, examined more than 10m blood samples from US military personnel collected over 20 years and identified that those who became infected with EBV were 32 times more likely to later develop MS. Perhaps tellingly, the levels of a protein called neurofilament light chain – a marker in the blood that indicates nerve degeneration is occurring – increased only after EBV infection. Ascherio explains that it was possible to prove this association for the first time only because of the sheer number of people involved in the study. “The high prevalence of EBV in the general population has been a huge obstacle in demonstrating a causal link in the past,” he says. “This study shows that EBV is the leading cause of MS, but there are clearly other factors involved such as genetics and vitamin D deficiency among EBV-positive individuals. To provide an analogy, most smokers will never develop lung cancer, and similarly, most EBV-infected individuals will not develop MS.” So why is it that most of us can coexist unknowingly with EBV and never develop either EBV-related cancers or MS, but yet for some, the infection becomes a pathway to chronic illness? The answer lies in the delicate balance between the virus and the body’s immune system. Hiding out in the body’s B-cells, EBV emerges now and then to replicate and avoid getting eradicated altogether by immune defenders called T-cells. But if it is allowed to replicate too much because the host’s T-cells are not functioning properly or they are immune-suppressed in some way, the virus can move into other tissues, causing damage. A recent example of this is in some cases of long Covid where the symptoms have been linked to reactivation of EBV, a mechanism that has also been proposed as a cause of chronic fatigue syndrome. “It seems clear that EBV reactivation could play a role in long-term consequences of Sars-CoV-2 infection,” says Jeff Gold, a researcher at the World Organisation, which studies long Covid. “The family of symptoms for some long Covid patients is identical to those we would expect from the virus reactivating.” In the case of MS, Ascherio suggests the inability of the body to keep the virus in check means that EBV ends up in nerve cells. “EBV-infected B-cells could be more prone to invade the central nervous system and cause damage,” says Ascherio. He believes that the presence of the virus within the central nervous system induces an autoimmune reaction, because of coincidental similarities between EBV proteins and the myelin sheaths that form a protective layer around nerves in the brain and spinal cords. This causes the body to attack its own cells, leading to progressive degeneration. The factors that cause EBV-infected individuals to develop various forms of cancer are an even more complex mixture of genetics and immune dysfunction. It appears that EBV can suppress the normal dying process of infected cells, and if these cells happen to possess other aberrant mutations, they can then grow and develop into a tumour. But it is thought that the chances of this happening can be heightened by certain lifestyle factors. For example, chemicals such as tobacco smoke, pesticides and food additives might be able to interact with EBV and either amplify its genome within B cells, or alter the way it interacts with the immune system in some malignant fashion. “The chances of an EBV-infected person developing an EBV-positive tumour are very, very low,” says Alan Rickinson, a cancer researcher at the University of Birmingham, who has studied EBV for the past 50 years. “But of course there are predisposing factors that can increase the risk.” Rickinson points to the example of nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC), one of the cancers that has been linked to EBV. While people of southern Chinese ethnicity have been shown to be more genetically prone to getting NPC, this is not the whole story. In reality, the likelihood of someone developing NPC or not comes down to a combination of genetic susceptibility, EBV exposure and lifestyle factors. “Studies from Hong Kong in particular have highlighted the practice of weaning infants on salted fish, a concoction known to contain potential carcinogens,” Rickinson says. “This is one example of a lifestyle factor that may increase the chances of NPC developing later in life.” When the connection between EBV and certain cancers began to emerge in the 1980s, Balfour set his sights on developing a vaccine to prevent people from becoming infected with the virus. Over the next 30 years, his efforts would repeatedly be knocked back as pharmaceutical companies stalled and mulled over whether such a jab would be economical. But the advent of cheaper messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology over the past two years, and the discovery that EBV appears to be the main cause of MS, has added new impetus for bringing such a vaccine to market. As Balfour puts it: “I think the evidence is now very, very strong that EBV is necessary for MS. And if you take EBV away, you don’t get MS.” After years of little progress, there are now three EBV vaccines in the pipeline. Moderna has turned its attention towards the virus, and is conducting phase 1 clinical trials of an mRNA vaccine for EBV at 15 centres across the US, while research teams at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Balfour’s own lab are working on their own jabs. Moderna’s clinical trial is targeting people in the 18-30 age range, but given that so many people contract EBV as children, the ultimate aim is to administer the vaccine to infants. However, there remain many challenges and questions ahead. “One obstacle is that it will take a very large study of long duration to demonstrate that an EBV vaccine prevents MS, so most likely experimental studies will need to rely on intermediate outcomes, such as whether the vaccine prevents EBV infection and mononucleosis,” says Ascherio. The other question is whether the vaccine will need to provide what scientists call sterilising immunity – preventing the virus from binding at all to human cells – in order to prevent cancers and MS, or whether simply limiting the severity of the infection will be sufficient. “There are few vaccines that induce sterilising immunity,” says Katherine Luzuriaga, a professor of molecular medicine at UMass Chan Medical School, who is leading Moderna’s clinical trial. “However, it is possible that an effective EBV vaccine could limit the dissemination of the virus, prevent aberrant immune reactivity, and reduce viral load at the initiation of infection, all factors that may play a role in downstream disease pathogenesis not only in MS but EBV-related cancers as well.” Researchers are also interested in whether antiviral drugs that directly target EBV could provide ways of halting the progression of the disease in patients who already have MS. But while scientists have identified a number of candidates that can stop EBV replicating in a test tube, finding a drug that can clear the virus from the body remains a challenge. But for Balfour, there is a sense of encouragement that progress is finally being made in an area that has been greatly neglected for so long. “The Science paper has been a gamechanger and a sort of vindication of something that I believed in,” he says. “For a long time, there’s been this known association between EBV and MS, but when I would apply for grants, people would still say that EBV has little if anything to do with MS. But now people are rethinking the value of an EBV vaccine, as we’ve seen that it’s much better not to get infected at all.”",News/Science,"Can we vaccinate against Epstein-Barr, the virus you didn’t know you had?",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/20/can-we-vaccinate-against-epstein-barr-virus-multiple-sclerosis-cancer
3/20/2022,"There is delicious Congolese food to be had in Brussels – a legacy of Belgium’s colonial history. For a lot of choice, I would go to Matongé, a buzzy, very multicultural area close to the city centre. I have two favourite restaurants there. Chez Malou Bomboka, at 104 Chausée de Wavre is very popular, yet the service is relaxed. Malou, who runs it, came to Belgium with nothing 40 years ago and now has a number of restaurants in Brussels. Its chicken wings are popular, but you shouldn’t miss out on the goat, which is street food in Kinshasa, capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. I also enjoy Malou’s pondu, a cassava-leaf stew. The other good Congolese restaurant in Matongé is Inzia: it does a €20 buffet, with grilled goat, beans, plantains and peanut chicken stew. In Ganshoren, the Brussels district where I was mayor until last month, we have fine-dining restaurants such as San Daniele and Bruneau by Maxime Maziers, but also good spots for smaller budgets. Brasserie The Spoon is good for moules. When a footballer wins a match in England they usually run over to celebrate with their supporters, but when my son Vincent captained Manchester City to win the League Cup final in 2016, he stopped and went back to try to console the Liverpool players. Because of this a Belgian organisation called Panathlon Wallonie-Bruxelles gave Vincent one of its fair play awards (he couldn’t make it to the ceremony, so I accepted it for him). We erected a fair play monument at a crossroads in Ganshoren close to football and basketball pitches, and to the tennis courts where Kim Clijsters won her first trophy, when she was 15. The statue is of four hands linked together. There are three main attractions in Brussels: the Grand-Place, the Atomium, which was built for the Brussels World Fair in 1958, and the Basilica of the Sacred Heart in my district, Ganshoren. This is one of the biggest churches in the world. The Mannekin Pis, the statue of a little boy in the centre of Brussels, was recently dressed in the red-and-gold colours of Ganshoren, so I have to put in a word for that too. I also like Jette, a leafy district a little further north, which is good for strolling. Near the station is a great-value meze and spare-ribs restaurant called Les P’tits Os, with bare-brick walls, wooden floors and menus written on a chalkboard. One of the nicest woods in Brussels, the Bois du Laerbeek, is in between Ganshoren and Jette. There is a protected nature area, a pond and a river. My children used to be in the scouts, and every Sunday afternoon, their mother and I would drop them off and then go for a walk in the Bois du Laerbeek, and have a drink at its Norman-style chalet, which is a restaurant today. It is a very peaceful spot, with lots of birdlife to enjoy. I am not the best person to ask about drinking as I stick to Coca-Cola or sparkling water. But two good places for an evening out in Ganshoren are the Grand Duc, close to the Basilica, and the Brochette du Chalet, just around the corner. Jacques Brel, the Belgian singer and actor, used to play on the first floor of the Brochette. It has a very 1950s atmosphere. The Moeder Lambic Original in Saint Gilles, south of the city centre, is famous for Belgian beers. And for a perfect plate of Belgian frites, try Maison Antoine on Place Jourdan, near the EU quarter. There is only one hotel in Ganshoren, the Frederiksborg (doubles from €75 room-only), which is by the Basilica. The Bois du Laerbeek is a short walk away. When I became mayor, I said I would turn the area around the Basilica into more of a tourist attraction, and we are on our way to making it happen. Born in the DCR when it was still under Belgian control, Pierre Kompany, 74, was elected Belgium’s first black mayor in 2018.

3/20/2022,"The emergence of the expression “get a handle on” as a more modern version of “get to grips with” is an apt linguistic reflection of the history of technology. Putting handles on things is more modern than gripping them – 2.1 million years more modern, apparently. That sounds like a dizzying amount more modern to those of us living in this era of fast technological change. Can you imagine something 2.1 million years more modern than the latest iPhone? What would it be like? Some lights in a cloud of semi-opaque gas that follows you around sending all your data to the giant gas god in space that feeds on it and defecates long seasons of high-budget quality drama that trail down on to the Earth like goldfish poos on to gravel? I feel like it would be even weirder than that and any future-people who read this, maybe as part of some internet archaeology module, will laugh scornfully at my temporal parochialism through special new mouths they’ve swiftly evolved so they don’t have to endure even a momentary pause in their ingestion of delicious morphine pistachios. But most ages aren’t as fraught with science as ours. 2.1 million years more modern than a hand axe is just an axe with a handle. That’s how much later the first tools with handles were than the first tools without them. That seems fairly slow going and makes me feel better about having taken several years to think of putting a shoe rack by the front door. Handles, according to a Liverpool University study published last week in Royal Society Open Science, were a massive breakthrough for humanity, arguably more significant than the wheel, which didn’t trundle into existence for another 500,000 years. Tools with handles were much handier than those without – though the word should surely be handlier. You could apply more force to objects without expending more energy. Not every human invention has the resilience of handles, though handles aren’t always resilient. They often break but, in doing so, only reinforce the soundness of the concept. Does anyone fully appreciate the handles on a plastic bag until they snap? You don’t think: “There must be a better way!” You just want a new handle. Not so CDs. Their annoying unreliability, their propensity to get scratched and skip, to become grubby and then get further scratched when you wipe them, their maddening, clattery, self-disassembling boxes and, worst of all, the blood of the cassette tape that they have on their metaphorical hands, have all contributed to their decline. Some analysts were predicting that the CD market was about to be overtaken by vinyl. What a humiliation for the younger format! It would be like Steve Davis beating Ronnie O’Sullivan. It didn’t happen. It was announced last week that CD sales rallied in 2021, spearheaded by the new Adele and Abba albums, reaching £117.2m, a rise of 1.4% and the first increase in four years. Meanwhile, vinyl only reached £116m, though that represented growth of 34% and happened despite a global shortage of PVC (one of the few global shortages I hadn’t previously heard of, thanks to my unimpeachable private life). The bigger picture here, according to the British Phonographic Industry, which released the figures, is that physical music sales grew faster than streaming revenue. That’s a bit of a blow for the current economic orthodoxy. People still want the old breakable objects, not just weightless data. They’re bored with playing on their computers. What is behind this crazy new spending pattern? Is NHS prioritisation of physical over mental health to blame for this irrational Luddism, this spurning of our wondrous devices? It can’t be, because it’s happening in America as well. CD sales up, ebook sales down – it’s hard to get a handle on it. I reckon the explanation lies in a human invention even more powerful than either the handle or the wheel – an innovation that has enormously magnified our capacity for economic growth. It’s the gift. The gift, the present, is the thought that counts financially. It has supercharged capitalism. On top of the other reasons to spend money – because you need something, because you want something, because it’s cheap so you’ll get lots of it, because it’s expensive so you have to pay lots to get one of it – there’s this extra element: buying something you don’t want for someone else who probably doesn’t either. The social conventions surrounding gift-giving are strict. Aside from occasions when you might genuinely want to give someone something and have a reasonable idea of what they’d like, there are many many others – Christmas, birthdays, weddings, etc – where you have no idea what they want, other than the dozens or hundreds of things they already possess, but nevertheless absolutely have to give them something. When you can’t think of anything, books, tunes and films are perfect. There’s no limit to the number that it’s deemed appropriate to own and it’s easy, by your choice of title, to demonstrate the obligatory level of thought. “You’ve got a dog – here’s a book about dogs!” Ask any publisher and they’ll tell you how vital this is. The printing and selling of books exclusively to those who want to read them doesn’t constitute a viable industry. It relies on the giving of vast numbers of the things to people who may not even open them. And the same principle used to apply to films and music until the internet, in its diabolical folly, developed an unwrappable delivery mechanism: streaming. That was never going to work. It risked restricting album and video purchases just to the people who actually wanted to consume those albums and videos. Some will fall for a lame sort of emailed token, perhaps with an animation of a present on it, but normal people know that’s like a drinks party on Zoom – it doesn’t count. The invisible hand of the market is at work and it’s only taken 20 years, not 2.1 million. If a commodity can’t be gift-wrapped and put under a tree, people will only buy as much as they need. That won’t keep the lights on at Amazon, let alone Westfield.",Opinion/Opinion,Physical media is a gift that keeps being given | David Mitchell,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/20/physical-media-is-a-gift-that-keeps-being-given
3/20/2022,"There used to be a time when shopping was so straightforward. Into your shop of choice you went, selected what you wanted or asked for help, took your purchase to the till and paid for it. But not any longer, it seems. Consider the following breathless press release. “The number of customers who want digital-only contact methods doubled between 2019 and 2020, highlighting the effectiveness of digital channels and their importance over physical-only interactions. “An omnichannel experience is important to consumers, especially given that older consumers and those on low incomes are more likely to be digitally excluded, but a digital-first strategy will allow you to meet growing customer demand.” Given that I fall into the older consumer demographic, it’s probably no wonder that I feel bewildered. Do I really want an omnichannel experience? I think the answer is certainly no and that, wherever possible, I’ll stick to bricks-and-mortar establishments. Seems so much easier. A couple of interesting coinages recently. During the Wales v France rugby match, I’m sure I heard one commentator talk of a player’s skillability. What is wrong with “skill” is beyond me. And what on earth is a “sunshine sandwich”, as offered by a weather forecaster last week? I wrote a couple of weeks ago about the insidious creep of emojis, so was gratified to read a piece in the papers about their baleful influence. Research from the Coller School of Management at Tel Aviv University included the following finding: “A separate body of research shows that less powerful people desire social proximity more than powerful people do. Consequently, signalling that you’d like social proximity by using pictures is essentially signalling that you’re less powerful.” So it seems that emojis are for wimps. So, emoji users, desist unless you want the world to know that you’re twerps of the first water.

3/20/2022,"Top Boy | NetflixHolding (ITV) | ITV HubWeCrashed | AppleTV+Ukraine: Should We Do More? (Channel 4) | All 4 Like all great shows about drug-dealing, Top Boy – set on an east London housing estate – couldn’t care less about drugs. Returning for the pandemic-delayed Netflix second series, the fourth if you count the first two on Channel 4 (and you must), still largely written by creator Ronan Bennett and directed by, among others, Brady Hood, there’s a pointed lack of vicarious Scarface-style thrills. Titular “Top Boy” Dushane (Ashley Walters) doesn’t shove his face into a mound of cocaine. Drugs – coded as “food” – could be cornflakes for all the ceremony they’re afforded. In truth, Top Boy isn’t about drugs, it’s about love, death, loyalty, money, power, rivalry, betrayal. If it glamorises anything, it’s the concept of found-family – of belonging – until, shockingly, it doesn’t even glamorise that any more. Arriving in eight parts (available as a box set), the new series kicks off with Jamie (Micheal Ward) leaving prison, and, in spite of his attempted coup, going back to work with Dushane. “It’s just bad we’re here again, innit,” says Dushane, softly smiling with all the warmth of a slowly surfacing shark. Completing our trio of crack-cocaine musketeers, there’s Sully (Kane – Kano – Robinson), living on a barge (just go with it) and nursing grudges that throb like malignant tumours. From there, it’s a dizzying whirl around a multifaceted hell: with themes including Windrush, Spanish-Moroccan drug-runs, dumped bodies, and an ending so stark you almost feel like ordering them back to re-do it. Female characters push through stronger: sphinx-like Jaq (Emmy-nominated Jasmine Jobson) finds a lesbian lover, and grapples with a terrifying Liverpool-based subplot; Shelley (Simbi – Little Simz – Ajikawo) has secrets oozing up from the London mud. Just as there are plans to gentrify the Summerhouse estate, Dushane – trying to go “legit” – seems a little refurbished himself: he keeps reminding people to remove their shoes before entering his palatial new pad. While such scenes echo Idris Elba as Stringer Bell sweating over his drug baron business plans, Top Boy continues to transcend its “British-Wire” roots. It isn’t perfect – the Windrush/gentrification themes feel tacked-on – but it’s not tired either. It remains a wild and terrible concrete western, blessed with note-perfect performances. On ITV, a new four-part Irish mystery drama Holding arrives brandishing robust credentials: it stars Conleth Hill (Game of Thrones; Dublin Murders), is written by Dominic Treadwell-Collins and Karen Cogan (adapting Graham Norton’s well received 2016 novel) and directed by Kathy Burke, an actor who knows plenty about unshowy human truths. Hill plays PJ, a self-doubting police garda, still considered a “blow-in” to his remote area of West Cork after nearly four years, and whose helpless binge-eating speaks of entrenched miseries. When human bones are unearthed, he and brash city-detective (Clinton Liberty) must solve a 20-year-old murder, with suspects including the dead man’s jilted bride, portrayed by Siobhán McSweeney (Sister Michael in Derry Girls), and his not-so-secret lover (Charlene McKenna). I enjoyed the opener, even if, at points, its depiction of the small community did veer dangerously towards “Irish theme park”, full of drunken/cavorting/gossiping stereotypes all but clad in leprechaun hats. Elsewhere, racial/LGBTQ elements (lesbian couples; gay, black police detectives) barely seem to register, which feels odd considering the otherwise heavily signposted “smalltown/small-minds” setting. Peeking ahead, the denouement could have been lifted from a slow episode of Vera. Still, there’s genuine sweetness, humour and pathos here, and lovely moments. Hill manages to convey PJ’s mid-life anxiety with the simple act of furtively unbuttoning his trousers to eat. And there’s the strangest, tenderest sex scene you’re ever likely to see. Watch out for Oscar-winner Brenda Fricker (My Left Foot), whose role as PJ’s abrasive housekeeper segues into more haunting powerful territory. Apple TV+’s eight-part WeCrashed, adapted from the Wondery podcast of the same name tells the real-life story of WeWork (the company behind the shared workspace/lifestyle concept), and how its stock-market value boomed and then plummeted. It focuses on WeWork cofounder Adam Neumann and his wife, Rebekah, played by Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway, with a strong supporting cast, including America Ferrera (Ugly Betty). Leto and Hathaway are almost too convincing as the global New Age entrepreneurs. “I don’t want to be a billionaire, I want to be a trillionaire,” says Adam, his eyes gleaming like a hipster Willy Wonka. “I’m a serious vegan” drones zombie-voiced Rebekah (incidentally, the real-life cousin of Gwyneth Paltrow). In the three available episodes, a tedious amount of time is wasted on how the couple met (who cares?). Nor did I completely grasp the WeWork “revolution”, but don’t mind me, I’m clearly too past-it to grasp the corporate-community magic of table-football, beanbags, and Hustle Harder neon signs. Things vastly improve in episode three, with the unfolding of a hilariously disastrous WeWork festival, and the millennial workforce twigging that they’re getting paid in free beer while the bosses arrive in helicopters. I’m not sure that corporate-downfall sagas are always so flat-out telegenic – see also, Disney+’s recent The DropOut starring Amanda Seyfried – but let’s hope that WeCrashed keeps aiming for the darker underbelly of the American Dream. A special edition of Channel 4 News introduced the live debate Ukraine: Should We Do More?, hosted by Matt Frei, who has recently returned from a month’s reporting in Ukraine. Filmed in front of a studio audience, some of whom had family trapped in the country, it featured a guest panel including Lord Richard Harrington, the new minister for refugees, and Emily Thornberry, shadow attorney general. This was a fast-paced, intense hour dealing with issues such as the (belated) plans for refugees, the cost of sanctions for Britain – as well as for Russia – and whether more should be done militarily. Dr Olenka Pevny, from the University of Cambridge, argued that genocide was unfolding before our eyes. Others expressed concern that introducing a no-fly zone over Ukraine would trigger a third world war. This was a brave choice for a live discussion, and, although occasionally hectic, it was handled well. However useless “just talking” might feel, the conversation must continue.

3/20/2022,"The net zero transition is really a big invest-to-save plan. Saving the planet is obviously the main goal, but there are purely financial savings too if you take the long view: we pay upfront in the next few decades for the infrastructure for lower carbon travel, heating and production, which saves us money over time because it’s cheaper to run. Electric vehicles (EVs) are where the big savings come from. A year’s petrol or diesel typically costs well over £1,000, but if you can charge an electric car at your home overnight the annual fuel cost can be under £150. Making the EV switch is a big job – we’ve got 32m cars to replace. But the turnover has recently gone up several gears, with EV sales outpacing all forecasts: they now account for one in five new car purchases. Interesting new research digs into how sensitive are drivers pondering the switch to the savings that come from moving from petrol to electric vehicles. Using data from California, it shows the obvious: EV sales respond both to electricity prices (falling as they rise) and to petrol prices (rising as pump prices increase). The interesting bit is that sales respond to petrol prices at around four to six times the rate of electricity prices. Why? Consumers are just less aware of electricity prices than petrol prices. I definitely am, having watched petrol pump prices rise by 40p a litre over the past year. So if you want a (small) silver lining to today’s catastrophic energy price surge, it’s that bonkers pump prices should encourage more people to buy electric vehicles while nuts electricity prices won’t put them off much.
