3/31/2022,"A manufactured boyband has two objectives. In the short term, it is to sell as much “product” – from albums to dolls – as possible. The longer-term aim is to achieve the kind of fame where the wider public can put names to the members’ faces, thus smoothing the way for post-band careers. The Wanted, a British-Irish quintet who had helped revive the stagnant boyband sector in the early 2010s, did not quite reach that point. Despite having two UK No 1 singles with All Time Low and Glad You Came, and their own dolls, they were overshadowed by the juggernaut of One Direction and in 2014 announced a hiatus. In the singer Tom Parker’s judgment, their time at the top had been “like Beatlemania”, but that was a considerable overestimate. When the hiatus turned out to be permanent, each of the band was left to find his own solo path, without much in the way of mass support. If it had been up to Parker, who has died aged 33 of a brain tumour, they would not have disbanded, and he made it clear he was open to a reunion, but there was a plus side to no longer being one of five laddish heartthrobs. Life in the Wanted, whom he joined after beating 1,000 other hopefuls at an audition in 2009, had been constrictive. The low-key, witty one of the troupe, Parker was proud of their relative singularity – “We established a great brand as boybands go; we were the catalyst, we were the first boyband not to dance, we weren’t clean” – but had chafed at being “a product … a machine … in pop, the artist control is very limited”. Once clear of the Wanted, he spent a year in recording studios, learning the nuts and bolts of making records, and emerged as a dance music producer specialising in EDM and house. During that year, he kept his hand in by appearing as featured vocalist on the track Fireflies by the former N-Dubz rapper Richard Rawson, but by the time he was ready to fully relaunch, he had missed the golden hour when being an ex-member of the Wanted might have ignited interest. Parker released half a dozen tracks between 2015 and 2019, both under his own name and as half of Lost + Found – an EDM production duo in which he was partnered by the former X Factor contestant Ollie Marland – but never hit the charts again. That was something of an injustice, as the 2019 L+F song Ghosted was a fine piece of club-pop. Between track releases, Parker took the route perennially open to former boy- and girlbanders – reality TV. He appeared on the 2015 edition of Celebrity MasterChef, impressing the judges with his tarragon sauce but ending up in hospital after putting his hand in a blender. In 2016, he finished third in the winter-sports competition The Jump. Much of 2017 was consumed by playing Danny Zuko in a touring version of Grease: The Musical, for which he won some warm reviews; during the 2018 panto season, Parker was Prince Charming in Cinderella in Llandudno. In the last four years he also appeared with his wife, the actor Kelsey Hardwick, in a vlog series called Meet the Parkers. His primary role was acting the wry foil to the exuberant Hardwick as she documented their lives before and after their 2018 wedding. Tom was born in Bolton, the younger son of Noreen (nee Roche) and Nigel Parker. An ardent fan of Oasis and Stereophonics, he learned the guitar at 16, and auditioned for the TV series The X Factor the same year. Being rejected was so confidence-sapping that he gave up hope of being a musician, and returned to school. Despite receiving three Us at A-level, he got on to a geography course at Manchester Metropolitan University. Parker later claimed that when he joined the Wanted, “pop music wasn’t even on my radar”, but in reality it had been for several years. He had left university after a year to be “Mark Owen” (and occasionally “Howard Donald”) in a local Take That tribute act, and so was practised enough to win a place in the Wanted in the first round of auditions. Managed by Jayne Collins, who had also assembled the successful girl group the Saturdays, the Wanted reached No 1 with their debut song, All Time Low, and Parker thrived as the lineup’s likable joker. “We were happiest when we were on stage, [but] it was all this shit with politics, the record label and too many opinions that caused friction,” he said in 2018. In 2020, while Hardwick was pregnant with their second child, Parker was diagnosed with a stage four glioblastoma. His memoir, Hope, will be published in July. He described it as “about finding hope in whatever situation you’re dealt, and living your best life no matter what”. He is survived by Kelsey, their daughter, Aurelia, and son, Bodhi, and his parents.

3/31/2022,"“I’m very saddened but not at all shocked by what I’ve read of Donna Ockenden’s report. I’m sad about the treatment that the women received and that they were never listened to or had their complaints investigated properly. Unfortunately, though, I’m not surprised by any of it. I feel like the same things that were revealed in Shrewsbury and Telford could be occurring in the majority of maternity units in the UK. I say that because we are chronically understaffed. Every time you come on shift you don’t have enough people to deliver a safe service. That understaffing is widespread across the NHS. And that lack of maternity staff is risky for mothers and babies. We don’t have enough bodies on the ground. It’s not just midwives, though. We’re also short of obstetricians, maternity support workers and admin staff, too. That means that midwives end up getting stretched doing lots of things that could easily be done by someone else, like filling in paperwork so that a mother can go home with her baby. As a result their skills, especially to monitor women and babies, aren’t used. And that’s how things can get missed, such as a baby’s heartbeat becoming irregular or the mother developing a problem. Delaying monitoring someone means you’re going to miss opportunities to intervene earlier in a situation. Monitoring is vital. But if midwives don’t have the time to do it then problems can occur. That could be the monitoring of foetal growth in the antenatal period, which Ockenden found was a problem at Shrewsbury and Telford. Or it could be monitoring a baby’s heartbeat during labour and delivery. Or it could be monitoring women’s mental health after they’ve given birth. If you don’t have the time to sit and actually be with women and understand what they’re experiencing, and listen to their concerns, then you miss a lot of the clinical picture. But there aren’t enough staff to monitor women and babies reliably all the time. And the impact of that on mothers and babies is enormous. Mistakes also happen because we don’t listen to women effectively, which again is closely linked to the time pressures midwives are under, because maternity services are full most of the time. We know best. When women raise a concern we can say ‘Oh no, this is OK because of X, Y or Z.’ But then when you review their notes later you see there were missed opportunities to improve their care. Ockenden also found that there was a culture of reluctance to perform caesarean sections at Shrewsbury and Telford, which led to babies dying during birth or shortly after. And I recall that the report in 2015 of the Morecambe Bay maternity care inquiry found the same thing there, too. I’ve not seen that reluctance in any of the delivery suites that I’ve worked in. But I do recognise that the Royal College of Midwives had a whole campaign around what they call ‘normal birth’ and are now backtracking from that quite rapidly. Childbirth is inherently risky. However, midwives and obstetricians have a different standpoint on what constitutes risk and that leads to some of the problems in communication between them. I think we midwives struggle to work alongside obstetricians and anaesthetists too as part of the multi-professional team that women need during their care. And as a result we miss things, not just when there’s an emergency but throughout the whole pathway of maternity care. The saddest bit of the Ockenden review for me is seeing how rude NHS staff were to mothers. When you start to get this chronic understaffing you also start to lack civility to your colleagues and compassion to those that you’re caring for. And those are the things that stay with mothers, that they weren’t listened to and weren’t treated with proper compassion. Midwives feel beaten-up at the moment and exhausted – absolutely exhausted – after two years of Covid, the review of maternity care, all the media focus on that and staffing pressures. I don’t want this to be a situation where we say ‘midwives are not doing a great job’. Midwives working within well-supported structures help save women’s and babies’ lives. But we are not well supported. And that’s when the failings come. We need to be well supported and that’s not happening.”",News/Society,"‘As an NHS midwife, the Shrewsbury baby deaths report didn’t surprise me’",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/30/as-an-nhs-midwife-the-shrewsbury-baby-deaths-report-didnt-surprise-me
3/31/2022,"It has been five years in the making. The independent inquiry into the largest maternity scandal in the history of the NHS began with one grieving mother looking for answers and ended up involving 1,486 families and 1,592 clinical incidents. The deeply distressing story of Shrewsbury and Telford hospital NHS trust, where hundreds of babies needlessly died or suffered life-changing injuries, is well known. Even so, when the final 234-page report by Donna Ockenden was published at 10am on Wednesday, the details shocked many of those reading it. Among them was the former health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who commissioned the inquiry after being approached by Rhiannon Davies and others affected by poor care at Shrewsbury. The findings of Wednesday’s report were “far worse” than he could ever have imagined, he said. The report is harrowing. It describes in detail for the first time how 201 babies and nine mothers could have or would have survived if the trust had provided better care. Ockenden found the trust presided over catastrophic failings for two decades – and did not learn from its own woefully inadequate investigations – which led to more babies being stillborn, dying shortly after birth or being left severely brain damaged. Much has been made of how some women were forced to have “natural births” despite the fact they should have been offered a caesarean. Indeed, Ockenden found that for 20 years the caesarean section rate at the trust was consistently 8% to 12% below the English average. Incredibly, this was held up locally and nationally as a good thing. However, the suggestion by some that the focus on “natural births” was the main cause of the scandal is misplaced. Indeed, the final report makes this clear. Instead, the deadly tragedy at Shrewsbury was the result of a toxic cocktail of issues. Staff were “overly confident” in their ability to manage complex pregnancies, and there was a culture of “them and us” between midwives and obstetricians, which meant some midwives were scared to involve consultants. Investigators found “repeated failures” to escalate concerns, delays in women being admitted to labour wards, and delays to women being assessed for emergency intervention. NHS staff also repeatedly failed to adequately monitor babies’ heart rates, with catastrophic results, alongside not using drugs properly in labour. A lack of staff, a lack of training, and a lack of oversight or sufficient concern from trust leaders were also to blame. Tragically, many of these issues remain a persistent problem in maternity services across England. Shrewsbury is not alone. Morecambe Bay, East Kent and Nottingham hospitals have all had poor maternity care exposed in recent years. Naturally, this prompts the question of what needs to change if these scandals are to be avoided elsewhere. Ockenden has raised 15 areas for “immediate and essential action” to improve care and safety in maternity services across England. Areas such as accountability, clinical governance and robust support for families have all been included as “must dos”. One of the key areas that needs to improve is staffing levels. The report said maternity and neonatal services in England required a multi-year settlement from NHS England “to ensure the workforce is enable to deliver consistently safe” care. However, health leaders have told the Guardian that the current shortage of more than 2,000 midwives means that women and babies will, for now, remain at risk of unsafe care. More widely, the NHS must demonstrate an ability to admit to mistakes and learn from them, and promote a culture of openness. Five years ago, this journalist was in Shrewsbury investigating the baby deaths when a board meeting of the trust was held in the town. Simon Wright, then the chief executive, told those present he was “committed to being candid and open about any incident” while refusing to answer any questions about the emerging scandal. One woman told Wright his behaviour was “utterly disgraceful”. And when demands for the board’s non-executive directors to question Wright were met with silence, members of the public chanted “Shame on you, shame on you”. But that wasn’t the worst of it. The board arrived at the meeting accompanied by two security men. Afterwards, a mother whose baby girl died after failures at the trust said: “Isn’t it a shame our babies weren’t offered the same level of safety?”",News/Society,Baby deaths inquiry points to issues across England’s maternity services,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/30/baby-deaths-inquiry-reveals-issues-across-englands-maternity-services

A joint statement was posted on his family’s social media accounts, explaining that Willis had been “experiencing some health issues and has recently been diagnosed with aphasia, which is impacting his cognitive abilities. “As a result of this and with much consideration Bruce is stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him.” The statement continued: “This is a really challenging time for our family and we are so appreciative of your continued love, compassion and support. We are moving through this as a strong family unit, and wanted to bring his fans in because we know how much he means to you, as you do to him. “As Bruce always says, ‘Live it up’ and together we plan to do just that.” Willis, 67, rose to fame on the TV show Moonlighting, before establishing himself as prolific action star known for his wry delivery. Aside from the Die Hard films, he also won plaudits for his roles in films such as Pulp Fiction, The Fifth Element, Twelve Monkeys, The Sixth Sense and Moonrise Kingdom. One of the most bankable stars of the 1980s and 1990s, Willis also carved out a substantial niche in family comedies, most notably voicing a baby on Look Who’s Talking and its sequel. He has also made three albums as a singer – his cover of Under the Boardwalk got to No 2 in the UK singles chart – and starred in multiple stage productions, making his Broadway debut in 2015 with a revival of Misery. Willis was married to the actor Demi Moore for 23 years; they share three daughters.

3/31/2022,"Much of the UK will go the polls on 5 May for local and regional elections that will be seen as a key test for Boris Johnson after months of negative headlines over allegedly lockdown-breaking parties. Local elections can be hard to decode, so here is what is up for grabs, and what we might learn. In England, there is a fair bit: 33 metropolitan borough councils, covering 904 seats; 21 unitary authorities, with 627 seats; 60 district councils (1,011 seats); 32 London boroughs (1,817 seats); plus mayors in six London local authorities, and a South Yorkshire combined authority mayor. In Scotland, there are 1,219 seats up for grabs in 32 councils, while for Wales it is 1,234 seats in 22 councils. Northern Ireland will vote for the 90 members of its devolved assembly. For the Conservatives, they are confident of some gains, including taking control of Sunderland council from Labour for the first time, despite worries over “partygate” and the cost of living, which would be a boost for Johnson. Labour will be looking to show progress in councils such as Dudley in the West Midlands, which the Conservatives took control of last year. Labour will also hope for strong results in London, with key boroughs including Barnet, Westminster and Wandsworth, all of which are Tory-held. In Wales, Labour will be hoping to keep control of Cardiff, and in Scotland, the Conservatives will be defending seats won in 2017, when the party performed relatively well. Elections for the assembly could be crucial, not least because polling currently predicts that Sinn Féin will overtake the DUP as the largest party in Stormont, which would mark a notable shift in political fortunes. There are concerns that, if relegated to being the second-largest party, the DUP could refuse to take part in the power-sharing system unless the UK government meets its Brexit protocol demands. This could mean a return to rules from London, just two years after power sharing was restored after a three-year political standoff. It is very hard to call. Local elections are always tricky to forecast, not least because many councils are returning just some councillors in wards, while this year many boundaries have also changed. In England these were seats last fought in 2018, when both Labour and the Lib Dems made gains, especially in London, while the Conservatives saw a net reduction in councillors. Labour have been consistently above the Tories in national polls for the past few months, but that might not translate into gains, given the 2018 results and the mix of councils. Polling shows his personal favourability with the public remains notably low, and opposition parties have said they hear from a lot of “soft” Tory voters who are disillusioned with him. The Conservatives had hoped the war in Ukraine had diverted attention away from the headlines over parties, but the decision by police this week to fine 20 people involved in illicit gatherings in or around Downing Street during lockdowns has refocused attention on the issue. A key factor could be if Johnson is fined before 5 May, or if the full report into the parties compiled by senior civil servant Sue Gray is released by then, and what it says. It varies. Some councils, including some in London, and certain metropolitan and unity councils, will count overnight on the Thursday, but even then the results might not come before Friday morning. Counts for other councils, and for the Northern Ireland assembly, will happen on Friday. With local elections, it is always worth reckoning on about 24 to 36 hours before you get a proper picture of who has done well or not.",News/Politics,"UK local elections: what is up for grabs, and what might we learn?",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/30/uk-local-elections-2022-what-is-up-for-grabs-and-what-might-we-learn
3/31/2022,"Tom Parker, a singer with the Wanted, has died aged 33 from brain cancer. His wife, Kelsey, said on Instagram: “It is with the heaviest of hearts that we confirm Tom passed away peacefully earlier today with all of his family by his side. Our hearts are broken, Tom was the centre of our world and we can’t imagine life without his infectious smile and energetic presence.” She said she and Parker’s family were “truly thankful for the outpouring of love and support” he had received after the diagnosis of an inoperable brain tumour in October 2020. He is also survived by the couple’s two children, Aurelia, two, and Bodhi, one. Parker was one of five endearingly high-energy members of the Wanted, who became one of the most popular British boybands in a generation. Their debut 2010 single, the anthemic All Time Low, reached No 1, as did Glad You Came in 2012. Before going on hiatus in 2014, they had six other UK Top Five songs, including the dance-pop hits Walks Like Rihanna, Chasing the Sun and Lightning, all of which brought a boisterous British personality to the EDM-laced pop of the era. His four bandmates paid tribute to Parker, calling him “our brother” and saying: “Words can’t express the loss and sadness we feel. Always and forever in our hearts.” In 2021, Parker fronted a documentary for Channel 4’s Stand Up to Cancer strand, following his life with his family as he underwent treatment. He announced in November that his tumour was stable, and he was able to perform on select nights of the Wanted’s tour of UK arenas earlier this month after the group’s reunion in 2021, but his condition suddenly deteriorated. His memoir, Hope, will be published in July after its announcement earlier this month. He described it as “about finding hope in whatever situation you’re dealt, and living your best life no matter what”. Outside the band, he played Danny Zuko in a touring production of the musical Grease, and also appeared on talent shows The Jump and Celebrity MasterChef. Among those also paying tribute to Parker was Martin Kemp, who said “your bravery, your fight and your spirit will never be forgotten”.",Arts/Music,The Wanted singer Tom Parker dies from brain cancer aged 33,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/30/the-wanted-singer-tom-parker-dies-from-brain-cancer-aged-33
3/31/2022,"When Edwin Hubble demonstrated that the universe was expanding, he couldn’t have known that a century later the Marvel Cinematic Universe would be expanding even faster. But it is: there are a dozen planned MCU movies, including Spider-Man 4, Deadpool 3, Captain America 4 and Guardians of the Leatherette Spacesuits 5, only one of which I made up. Prof Brian Cox tells me that, at the current rate of expansion, if there aren’t already more Guardians of the Galaxy than there are galaxies, there will be before you have finished reading this article. In fact, the situation is even more worrying than his calculations suggest: the next Benedict Cumberbatch vehicle, which will be released this spring, is called Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. It posits not one but many universes, all growing faster than the retail prices index. Into this inflationary gallimaufry of intergalactic flapdoodle comes Moon Knight (Disney+), a TV spin-off developed by the Marvel boss, Kevin Feige. Since 2018, Feige has been astutely plundering the Marvel database for obscure characters whose backstories can be fluffed for TV series. The results, such as WandaVision and What If …?, have been more rewarding than anyone who sat through Avengers: Age of Ultron might have imagined possible. Moon Knight is as witty and philosophically interesting as the first two. We may not need another hero, but, if we did, better Moon Knight than Dark Knight. Moon Knight made his first appearance in the comic Werewolf by Night in 1975. His backstory is uncannily similar to mine. The son of a rabbi, Marc Spector was a CIA-agent-cum-mercenary who was mortally wounded, then brought back to life by Khonshu to battle the bird-skulled Egyptian moon god’s no less freaky nemesis, Ammit. She, as you may recall from your primary school ancient Egypt project, has a hippo’s hindquarters, a lion’s forequarters and the head of a crocodile, making her, if not a looker in the conventional sense, quite the formidable foe. So that is Moon Knight, a nocturnal warrior battling evil for us schmoes, while sporting impressive abs and a cape so voluminous he would get it caught in his bicycle spokes if he didn’t tuck it into his posing pouch. (Just one of the reasons why he doesn’t cycle to work.) In Jeremy Slater’s TV retool, though, there is a twist. Every morning, Moon Knight wakes up in the body of a mild-mannered museum gift shop assistant called Steven Grant. Each night, before retiring, Grant chains one ankle to his bedframe and puts tape across his front door so he can check later if he managed to slip his restraints during the night. Why such precautions? He doesn’t know, because he has dissociative identity disorder. He has no memory of being a mercenary, nor of his role in the historic struggle between ancient Egyptian deities. Each day, before his first coffee, he wakes up to an existential crisis akin to those of The Metamorphosis’s Gregor Samsa, Phil Connors in Groundhog Day and Leonard Shelby in Memento. Oscar Isaac has great fun with the role, playing Grant as if Indiana Jones were tragicomically trapped in the body of Some Mothers do ’Ave ’Em’s Frank Spencer. His accent and bodily tics were reportedly inspired by Karl Pilkington of An Idiot Abroad. He ends phone calls to his mum with “Laters, gators” and so is temperamentally unsuited to the demands of the first episode, namely holding on to a mechanical flying scarab beetle that Ammit’s lickspittles covet, not to mention eluding parkouring CGI dogs in the museum and gun-toting men in black bent on shoving him and his cupcake van over the precipice of a corniche. That said, Grant’s veganism, presented here as typifying his wimpishness, is a misstep: every vegan I know would go fist of Khonshu on the ass of any barista who put cow milk in their cortado. One night, during a museum inventory check, Ethan Hawke appears to Grant, sucking in his cheeks and doing that thing where he stares implacably. Hawke has even more fun with role – Arthur Harrow, Moon Knight’s leading foe and the top Ammit lickspittle – than Isaac does with his. “Consider this,” says Harrow, staring through every-day-is-a-bad-hair-day locks. “If Ammit had been freed, she would have prevented Hitler, the destruction of Europe, the Armenian genocide, Pol Pot.” Whatevs, say the eyes of Grant. But the very suggestion that the liberation of Ammit would bring justice to a world overrun by little men overcompensating for big problems seems, as Guardian leader writers tell us, far-fetched. While it remains to be seen whether Konshu’s righteous warriors will defeat Ammit’s and whether Grant will realise his supposed destiny by the finale, one thing seems certain. The Marvel Cinematic Universe will continue to expand. Only She-Hulk, coming later this year on Disney+, may be able to halt it – and I bet even she won’t have the upper-body strength.",Arts/Television & radio,Moon Knight review – Oscar Isaac is a crime-fighting Frank Spencer,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/30/moon-knight-review-oscar-isaac-is-a-crime-fighting-frank-spencer

Guardian Australia understands that the ABC managing director, David Anderson, will announce the appointment of Stevens as director of news, analysis and investigations on Thursday morning. Stevens, who has been the boss of 7.30 with its host Leigh Sales since 2018, is a surprise appointment as, at 37, he is relatively young and has only led one major news program. Fang has been acting in the role since the departure of Gaven Morris in October, who left the national broadcaster after six years in the role. The executive editor of ABC news and head of investigative journalism, Lyons, 60, was also passed over for the role.

The news director position is a highly political one. The director must manage staff expectations as well as front Senate estimates and defend programs, like Four Corners, from criticism. When he announced his departure in October, Morris, 50, urged the broadcaster’s 1,200 journalists to focus on the needs of the audience. “One of the things that I’ve encouraged staff to do constantly is not to look at small media mouthpieces that have an agenda; and look at the impact that we have with our audience,” Morris told Raf Epstein on ABC Melbourne, hours after announcing his resignation. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “And what I would say to our staff and our teams: look at the broader impact we have on the Australian public,” Morris, 49, said. “The Australian public often don’t think in the way that Sky News might think.

3/31/2022,"With a relentless storm circling the region bringing shrieking winds and the sky low and grey, the mood in Lismore on Wednesday was “bleak”, says the former mayor Jenny Dowell. The night before had been terrifying. “I never want to go through that again,” says Ellen Kronen, the president of the local chamber of commerce. “I can be pretty robust and don’t scare easily but the wind was intense, the rain was intense, it was loud. I have never been in a storm like it. I was a bit shaky when I woke up.” There was frustration, too, when an evacuation order was rescinded at 5pm on Tuesday and then reinstated at 3am on Wednesday. “There were no updates on evacuation orders even though we were pretty much in the middle of a cyclone,” says Noami Moran, the general manager of the Koori Mail. “There was a massive gap in communication with the SES, which is where the Lismore city council gets their feed. So yeah, people are not happy. I’ll tell you that much.” As Wednesday wore on, she says, you could “feel the heaviness all around”. At 11.30am on Wednesday, the 10.6 metre levee at the Wilson River was breached, with the water expected to reach 12 meters, higher than the 2017 flood. By Wednesday evening it was still rising, yet to peak, the basin spilling into the CBD and spreading out to north and south Lismore and the industrial estate. There was no electricity. It was steadier and slower than the torrent that hit the town four weeks ago, but it was, says the current mayor, Steve Kreig, “a major, major weather event”. “This would be one of the top three floods in Lismore’s history if it wasn’t for four weeks ago. It’s sort of a surreal situation after what we have lived through,” he says. Many residents of Lismore had nothing left to lose in Wednesday’s flood. The sound of rain on the roof will never be pleasant again. Kreig, who lost his house and cafe in the last floods, describes himself as “numb.” “We went through all the emotions, our sadness and our grieving four weeks ago. Really it’s like picking the bones off a carcass at the moment. “I haven’t lost my house because I lost it four weeks ago. All my belongings have already gone. What emotions are you supposed to feel other than exhaustion?” There is just disbelief, says Dowell. “I have been at the evacuation centre and some of the same people who were there four weeks ago are back again. The look on their faces is shock, trauma. ‘I can’t do this again, it’s too hard.’ “It’s very distressing. And people are tired, they haven’t slept well for five weeks. There’s stoicism in some people. But I think under that brave face, there’s a cracking, a splintering of confidence and will.” Until Wednesday, Lismore was taking the first tentative steps towards recovery. Chris Trew, who also lost his house four weeks ago, had started fixing it. “We’ve just bought a load of tools, insulation, we’ve spent a fair bit of money, but now it will all be wet and buggered,” he says. “No one is insured because it is too expensive. Our mortgage company told us they don’t want to do any mortgage or any finance whatsoever in Lismore. It’s too unpredictable.” Trew was staying at a friend’s house in Bangalow where water came through the walls on Tuesday night. “Before last night, I think people were quite positive and were quite keen on getting stuff fixed and trying to get back to normal,” he says, speaking to the Guardian on Wednesday. “But I think after last night and today there will be an awful lot of people that will decide maybe enough’s enough. People that have started to re-collect their belongings and try and re-establish themselves – I think a lot of people will sort of be very unstable after this because it’s just another blow. “People have already shelled out money to fix their places. And now they’re stuck in the position of having spent the money and stuff getting ruined again. Where do you get the next bit of money from to fix stuff?” One business owner in the CBD was too emotional to even speak. He had repaired his building, replaced everything, rewired it, and now it had gone under. Again. Others have no choice but to stay, Krieg says. “They have mortgages and different things that they have to pay. They have to reset and restart.” The ground is so waterlogged now that trees are falling over in the slightest wind. “It’s the same with homes and foundations,” Trew says. “Houses will start to move because the ground is so unbelievably wet.” The financial impact for a town that was trying to recover is enormous. “I haven’t had an income for six weeks,” says Kronen, who owns a craft business in the CBD. “I am living on savings and money I had committed to building a house. We are not completely back to square one – but pretty close.” When the businesses went under, so did many jobs. The federal MP for Richmond, Justine Elliot, supports having “a form of jobkeeper in Lismore for people who are unable to work because of the impact of the floods”. “They need to have some sort of income. We just need them to step up – both the federal and state governments. We really do. There’s a lot of people in really dire need,” Elliott says. The MP says there was no help for the devastated region in the budget. “It’s just frustrating and disappointing for the community because of the extent of it not to see a significant amount of money going into it. They’ve got that $4.8bn emergency fund and they’re just not using a huge amount of that to help us out at this time.” Elliott believes there should be a “full, independent, transparent inquiry into all the elements of the lack of preparation and lack of funding and capacity to deliver resources”. Naomi Moran is waiting for the water to recede to get back to the relief and food hub in the Koori Mail building. “The support that the community is going to need … because literally people have just dried their walls and now they’ve got to do it all over again.” There is still rubbish in the streets that hasn’t been picked up from the late February inundation. People were still cleaning up when this week arrived. But, says Trew, “there’s no point in crying – you have just got to keep going”.",News/Australia news,‘There’s a cracking’: Residents are broken in Lismore after the NSW town is flooded again,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/31/theres-a-cracking-residents-are-broken-in-lismore-after-the-nsw-town-is-flooded-again
3/31/2022,"This week the people of Lismore are again evacuating what’s left of their already flood-wrecked houses, as their levee was breached by flood waters and the rain continued to come down. Make no mistake, this disaster is fuelled by global warming which in turn is driven by carbon dioxide emissions from gas oil and coal, fossil fuels which are supported in the Morrison government budget. Along with other communities on the northern New South Wales coast, they face an extremely uncertain future with no insurance and no idea how they are expected to rebuild – or indeed relocate – their communities. Josh Frydenberg’s budget has an increased disaster resilience fund that he’s promised to raid more often in the face of these events, but without action to address the root cause of these escalating climate disasters this is just a palliative. If Morrison and Frydenberg were serious about climate resilience they would address the root cause of the problem, not fuel it. The cash the government has come up with in the budget is for past floods but ignores the likely costs of future storm surges, rising sea levels, and beach erosion along the eastern coasts. Also, the more floods and bushfires likely to occur as the climate continues to warm in the face of inaction from the likes of Frydenberg’s government. While he’s promised more cash for marine science programs that will continue to confirm the Great Barrier Reef is under threat and will suffer increased bleaching events as the world warms, he is again turning a blind eye to the root cause of the problem – the climate crisis and fossil fuel emissions, which this budget promotes. His government has lobbied against classifying the reef as being in danger from the heating climate. Yet as we speak another catastrophic bleaching event is overtaking this global icon, the great barrier reef. There is nothing in the budget that would address and arrest the threats to this reef and instead its different elements will support the growth in greenhouse gas emissions. Meanwhile, Frydenberg’s fossil fuel-fired federal ambulance at the bottom of the climate cliff will continue funding a gas-led future, pouring $50m into new infrastructure across seven different gas projects. We already know that Woodside’s Scarborough extension will add just under 1.4bn tonnes of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, equivalent to 27 years of Australia’s coal power generation emissions at 2018-19 levels. These projects will continue to pump carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, continuing to add to the very global warming that is contributing to the east coast flooding, the demise of the reef, the bushfires that have this year raged across Western Australia and will no doubt return to the east coast during the next record hot summer. The government, if re-elected is also set to cut climate spending by 35% over the next five years for its key climate change agencies – the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) and the Australian Renewable Energy (Arena) – both of which are tasked with investing in renewable or low emissions technologies. Luckily, it failed this week to force ARENA to start paying for unproven and hugely expensive carbon capture and storage ventures, which have spectacularly failed. Instead, the government is investing just under $250m over five years to support private sector investment in low emissions technologies including hydrogen. But creating the hydrogen to use as a fuel source produces emissions, and while projects are being proposed and at various stages, it’s still unclear how long it’ll take to reach the scale needed for it to be a viable alternative to fossil fuels. Out there in the real world, outside of the Morrison gas bubble, the big money and smart interest is going for green hydrogen at massive scale. Despite all the bluster from Angus Taylor and other Morrison ministers about the Russian invasion of Ukraine spurring a move the gas for energy security reasons the reality is otherwise. Meanwhile, over in Berlin, Andrew Forrest strikes a $50bn investment in green hydrogen with German energy giant E.ON. Essentially, the government has left investment, particularly in innovation and supply chain productivity, almost entirely up to the private sector. This is a budget of missed opportunity. Where are the measures to encourage the production and uptake of electric vehicles? While states are rushing to encourage the uptake of EV’s and set up charging networks, the federal government is MIA, with the country’s industry body, the Electric Vehicle Council, this week pointing out the market is so skewed that second hand Teslas are costing more than brand new ones. Yet the government, unlike so many of its global counterparts, still hasn’t put an end date to the sale of combustion vehicles, nor introduced fuel efficiency standards. It hasn’t lifted a finger to help this obvious new technological step that would cut emissions and reduce our reliance on oil. Cutting the fuel excise tax this year is a last-resort measure, when getting the transport sector off oil would build resilience and help the climate. Meanwhile at the global level, the International Energy Agency’s net zero scenario shows us that gas must be phased out by 2040’s at the latest, globally. And as other countries begin tackling the climate crisis, their use of gas is going to diminish, reducing the need for Australian gas – or any other gas for that matter. And this week the UN’s science body is finalising its report on what countries need to do to tackle climate change. While this has yet to be released, it’s clear that the top priority will be a 100% electrified energy system that doesn’t include fossil fuels, and that areas like transport and buildings Earlier this month the UN secretary general António Guterres singled out Australia as being a G20 laggard on climate change action, which it is. While other countries increased their 2030 targets, Australia has not, and it is nowhere near the Paris Agreement’s 1.5˚C warming limit. The Morrison government has failed to act on this and many other warnings. This budget digs Australia climate policy hole deeper, fuels increases of greenhouse gas emissions which will drive more climate catastrophe and fundamentally misses the turn to green solutions which would provide a much brighter economic future for the country and its regions.

3/31/2022,"The arts sector is facing a significant drop in federal government funding as pandemic support measures come to an abrupt end despite some industries struggling to recover. The arts minister, Paul Fletcher, said the inclusion in the budget of an additional $20m in Covid-19 relief under the Restart Investment to Sustain and Expand (Rise) scheme in 2022-23, first announced last week, was an “unprecedented injection” of art stimulus funding. The $20m was on top of the original $200m originally allocated to the Rise scheme, which had enabled festivals such as Bluesfest and shows such as Come from Away to go ahead. The extra money was part of a $38.3m increase over the next two years announced in Tuesday’s federal budget for the arts sector, including $9m for the National Museum of Australia. But the Fund the Arts coalition said the budget papers revealed a $190m drop in funding to the sector, the equivalent of a 19% cut, in 2022-23 compared to the previous year. The organisation described the funding reduction as “horrific and highly disappointing” for an industry still recovering from Covid restrictions. The Monash University cultural and creative industries academic Dr Ben Eltham, who advises the Fund the Arts coalition, said the funding continued to fall over the forward estimates to 2025-26. The sudden drop is largely due to the winding down of the Covid-19 stimulus program for the arts, he conceded. “But the sector is still on its knees, with venues only just reopening and audiences still well below 2019 levels.” According to the budget’s forward estimates, funding to most of Australia’s national collecting institutions will drop by between 4% and 21% over the next five years. Funding to the National Library of Australia, for example, will drop from $61m to $47m by 2026. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Some cultural institutions will see small rises over the same period. Australia Council funding will rise by almost 4% to $230.8m in 2025-26; The National Film and Sound Archive budget will experience a 5% increase in funding to $31m in 2026. While Screen Australia appears to take a huge cut in 2023-24 – from $28m to $12m – the sudden drop is due to a two-year period of additional funding announced in the 2020 budget coming to an end. “This won’t impact our ongoing funding programs,” a Screen Australia spokesperson said.

But in 2023-24, federal funding to Australian music, for example, will face a 20% cut. The industry’s peak body, Live Performance Australia, said the budget fell well short of supporting a post-Covid rebuild. “We were disappointed the budget does not provide more targeted support for those industries trying to rebuild after being disproportionately impacted by Covid,” the Live Performance Australia chief executive, Evelyn Richardson, said. “Targeted support to rebuild skills, and to underwrite and attract investment will enable us to create jobs, get our people back to work, more shows back on stage, our touring networks re-established, and our audiences back to live events.” Richardson said the live performance sector lost $1.4bn in revenue in 2020, and further significant losses were recorded in 2021 due to major lockdowns in Sydney and Melbourne. “We’ve also lost thousands of people across the industry and now face a severe skill and labour shortage, the worst ever experienced by the industry in living memory,” she said. “We’re grateful for the significant support the government has provided during the depths of the pandemic through programs such as Rise, but we now face a new set of challenges as we rebuild.” On Wednesday, Live Performance Australia repeated its call for the Morrison government to set up a temporary live entertainment events insurance scheme, similar to one the government set up for the screen industry. The $50m Temporary Interruption Fund, which has not been accessed by a single film or television production because it is only triggered when a production is forced to halt work due to Covid-19 infection, will be extended for a further six months to 30 June 2022.",Arts/Culture,Australian arts sector says budget cuts during pandemic recovery ‘highly disappointing’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/31/australian-arts-sector-says-budget-cuts-during-pandemic-recovery-highly-disappointing
3/31/2022,"Australia’s lowest-paid workers should get a 5% pay rise – or $2,000 more a year, according to a submission from unions to the industrial umpire. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has called for the minimum wage to increase from $20.33 an hour to $21.35, to boost the wages of 2.67m employees who rely on the annual wage review for a pay rise. The submission comes as the Morrison government fends off criticism that Tuesday’s budget provided only temporary cost of living relief to combat structural problems including high inflation and low wage growth. Last year inflation grew by 3.8%, compared with just 1.7% for wages, and the decline in real wages has continued this year, with inflation growing 1.25 percentage points faster than wages. The ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, said the claim for a 5% increase, to lift the annual minimum wage to $42,184, is “what is needed for Australian workers to keep their heads above water, with inflation and the cost of living rapidly rising”. “The Morrison government has projected real wage cuts this year, following on from the $800 cut last year,” she said. “This can be avoided if they support this wage claim.” Submissions to the minimum wage review are not due until Friday. The largest employer groups are expected to request rises of 2% to 3%. The Coalition government has tended to take a back seat in minimum wage cases before the Fair Work Commission, making technical submissions about the state of the economy but declining to endorse a pay rise of a particular size. McManus said “there are practical things this government can do to lift wages, but so far they have sat on their hands or pretended it’s someone else’s job”. In January Guardian Australia revealed aged care providers and unions had struck a deal to jointly call for pay rises in a separate work value case in that sector – but the Morrison government refused to participate in consultation, despite a recommendation from the aged care royal commission to do so. The budget predicted real wages will grow from 2022-23, but Labor has accused the government of presiding over a period of shrinking pay packets. The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said the government had a “pretty notorious record of overpromising and underdelivering on wages”, with 52 of the last 55 wage forecasts proving wrong. In question time on Wednesday, Scott Morrison said “in the budget year and over the forward estimates” real wages will increase. “And the reason that is occurring is that under this government we’ve got unemployment under 4%,” the prime minister said. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, told the National Press Club’s post-budget lunch that the wage price index is “expected to reach 3.25% next year – the strongest in almost a decade”.“Broader measures of wages are picking up even more quickly,” he said. “The national accounts measure of wages growth is expected to increase by 5% over the year to June 2022.”",News/Australia news,"Australia’s minimum wage should be raised by 5% to counter inflation and living costs, unions say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/31/australias-minimum-wage-should-be-raised-by-5-to-counter-inflation-and-living-costs-unions-say
3/31/2022,"Federal police blamed an “administrative oversight” for huge delays in reviewing war crime allegations against a Sri Lankan man as he travelled to and from Australia, documents show. In 2019, human rights groups wrote to the Australian federal police warning that Jagath Jayasuriya, a retired Sri Lankan general, “has entered Australia and may still be in the jurisdiction”. Jayasuriya is accused in multiple lawsuits of overseeing war crimes against separatist Tamils in the last stages of the country’s bloody civil war in 2009 – allegations which the Sri Lankan military rejects. The war crimes lawsuits, based on evidence gathered by the International Truth and Justice Project (ITJP), said he was in charge of troops in Sri Lanka’s north-east who allegedly abducted, tortured and killed civilians, attacked hospitals and committed acts of sexual violence. The AFP received detailed evidence from the Australian Centre for International Justice (ACIJ) in 2019 and told the group it took “such matters seriously” but would require the consent of then attorney general Christian Porter to investigate. Porter’s office later told the ACIJ it was not appropriate for the attorney general to get involved in a decision on whether a prosecution should take place. In August last year, the two human rights groups wrote to the AFP, seeking an update and pointing to a recent UN report which found Sri Lanka was allowing impunity for those suspected of atrocities in the civil war. In reply, the AFP said there had been an “administrative oversight” that meant the matter was “not allocated to an investigations team for review”. The AFP said it had not been aware of the oversight “until receipt of your recent letter”. “I can advise, however, that … your original report has been assigned for review by the special investigations team, counter-terrorism and special investigations command,” the AFP said. Last month, the AFP wrote to the two human rights groups to tell them it had decided not to commence an investigation, partly because “general Jagath Jayasuriya is not in Australia”. The AFP said the Sri Lankan government had set up internal investigations into the war crimes allegations and that the Australian government had previously endorsed that process. The human rights groups, along with the Tamil Refugee Council, are calling for an inquiry into the AFP’s handling of the complaint. “The AFP must answer for their abject failure in the handling of a serious criminal referral and our warning that an accused war criminal was roaming freely in Australia,” the ACIJ executive director, Rawan Arraf, said. The groups have also called for Australia to use the new Magnitsky-style sanctions against Jayasuriya. The ITJP executive director, Yasmin Sooka, said Australia must not allow itself to become a “haven for alleged war criminals from Sri Lanka” given its large Tamil community. “Magnitsky sanctions are an important tool for the international community to assert the truth for victims in situations when the country itself is unwilling to act,” Sooka said. The Guardian sought a response from Jayasuriya, via the Sri Lankan government through the country’s boxing selection committee – which he has served on – and via his Facebook page. No response was received. But both the Sri Lankan military and former Sri Lankan president Maithripala Sirisena have strongly denied the allegations. After the lawsuits in South America, Sirisena told a convention of his Sri Lanka Freedom party that he would protect Jayasuriya. “I state very clearly that I will not allow anyone in the world to touch Jagath Jayasuriya or any other military chief or any war hero in this country,” he said. Also speaking after the lawsuits, brigadier Roshan Seneviratne, a military spokesperson, said the accusations against Jayasuriya were false. “We maintain that these allegations are false,” Seneviratne said. “Although the LTTE [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam] was defeated by the military, their ideology is still alive and that is what we see in these allegations.” The UN estimates up to 70,000 people died in the final phase of the 30-year civil war, when the LTTE were defeated. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Last year, the UN Human Rights Council agreed to set up a team of investigators to collect evidence of atrocities and abuses. That followed a report from the UN office of the high commissioner for human rights, which found impunity for perpetrators of human rights violations was “more entrenched than ever”, more than a decade after the civil war ended. “While the criminal justice system in Sri Lanka has long been the subject of interference, the current government has proactively obstructed or sought to stop ongoing investigations and criminal trials to prevent accountability for past crimes,” the UN report said. An AFP spokesperson said it “conducted a comprehensive assessment of the report from the ACIJ”. “AFP inquiries determined there were more appropriate investigative mechanisms than the Australian judicial system to address the allegations in this particular matter,” the spokesperson said. “These include Sri Lanka’s current domestic commission of inquiry into war crimes allegations that was announced in January 2021 and legal action filed by a non-government organisation with the international criminal court.” The Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, was approached for comment.",News/Australia news,Federal police blame ‘oversight’ for delay in Australian review of Sri Lankan war crime allegations,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/31/federal-police-blame-oversight-for-delay-in-australian-review-of-sri-lankan-war-allegations
3/31/2022,"New cases of melanoma are set to increase by 50% globally by 2040, with a 68% increase in deaths, according to new research. An international team of researchers have analysed the global burden of melanoma, which accounts for approximately one in five skin cancers. Data from the International Agency for Research on Cancer estimated that there were 325,000 new melanoma cases and 57,000 deaths in 2020. The study, published in the journal JAMA Dermatology, found the cumulative risk of developing melanoma was highest in Australia and New Zealand, where one in 20 men and one in 30 women were affected by 75 years of age. The estimated incidence – the number of new cases in a given period – was 36 times greater in Australia than in many African and Asian countries, while the highest death rates from the skin cancer were seen in New Zealand. “Essentially that is because of our largely fair-skinned populations living in countries where we have very high ultraviolet radiation,” said study co-author, Prof Anne Cust, of Melanoma Institute Australia. Cust, also deputy director of the Daffodil Centre, said the paper “highlights how important it is to make some changes so that we can reduce the impact of melanoma.” Melanoma Institute Australia last month released a report calling for long-term investment in a national melanoma prevention and awareness campaign. Based on the incidence of melanoma in 2020, the study’s authors estimated that the health burden of cancer will increase to 510,000 new cases and 96,000 deaths globally by 2040. The projected rise in the number of people dying from melanoma in coming decades was largely driven by ageing populations, said study co-author Prof David Whiteman, an epidemiologist at the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In Australia, rates of melanoma have plateaued in recent years, but differ starkly among age groups, Whiteman said. Rates of melanoma were continuing to rise in people in their 50s and older, he said, while for “people in their 20s, 30s and 40s, rates are actually declining quite steeply”. “The most likely explanation is that the older people are still paying the price for sun exposure they incurred maybe decades ago, before Slip-Slop-Slap,” Whiteman said. Researchers are still learning more about skin cancer differences between men and woman. “Women have high rates of melanoma … before age of 50, in most countries in the world,” Whiteman said. “Then after 50, men’s rates tend to really take off.” While women are more likely to get melanomas on theirs leg, men tend to get them on their back, head and neck, said Whiteman. “That is a consistent observation around populations around the world.” The discrepancies were most likely due to differing patterns of sun exposure, he said. Chair of Cancer Council’s national skin cancer committee, Heather Walker, who was not involved in the study, said the findings were not surprising but highlighted the need for sustained awareness and prevention campaigns. “Given melanoma is such a preventable cancer, we could do more globally to improve prevention messages,” she said. “We’re spending $1.7bn a year on treating all types of skin cancer in Australia. That’s the highest amount of spend on any cancer type,” Walker said. “Investment in prevention is very modest by comparison.” “Not only are there health gains but there are also financial gains to be made in investing in prevention.” Cust agreed. “We do have a new campaign that’s just starting with two years of funding, but we’re really looking for more ongoing sustained funding.” “When you introduce a new prevention campaign, you don’t see the results of that the next year. Cancers take a long time to develop – you see the impact of that in 10 years’ time, 20 years’ time.” “It’s really important that people do take preventive actions. We know, for example, that wearing sunscreen reduces risk even at older ages. Even if you’ve had sun damage in the past, it’s important to use preventive behaviours.”",News/Science,"Global melanoma rate to increase by 50% by 2040, researchers predict",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/31/global-melanoma-rate-to-increase-by-50-by-2040-researchers-predict
3/31/2022,"The budget is always more political than economic – revealing what is the underlying philosophy of a government, why it is in power and what it wants to do. The amazing thing is just how obvious this budget was about its purpose, and just how clearly it revealed the death throes of this government. The answer from Tuesday’s budget was essentially: “Gee, I dunno … to give out some money … I guess … probably should have thought about those questions at some stage … oh well.” Rare has been the budget that is forgotten by the time the treasurer finishes his speech, but so it was on Tuesday night. The backbench mostly reached the conclusion of the speech with a realisation that, given he has stopped talking, I guess that means we applaud. When the best you can get from the Australian – is the headline “The cost of winning”, you have to know you failed even to meet your very low standards. What was perhaps most surprising, but also to an extent quite pleasing, was just how little anyone cared about the budget balance. In previous years it would have been headline news that the treasurer announced the budget balance had improved $20.9bn since the latest estimate just three months ago. Now, meh! The deficit remains massive and, even though the reduction is a larger one-year cut than previously experienced, so what? If the graph does not display, click here The pandemic has revealed that, when the manure hits the fan, people have realised you don’t eat a budget surplus. The budget surplus does not deliver healthcare or aid after a fire or flood, or keep you with an income when businesses around the nation are forced to close. It also has revealed that we have worried far too much about the debt. Even with the reduction in the budget deficit, our interest payments are set to remain below the level they were in the year before the pandemic until 2025-26: If the graph does not displace, click here None this is to suggest that the government can spend what it likes. The cost-of-living measures including the halving of the fuel excise and the addition to the low to middle income tax offset are just panicked spending that does nothing to improve productivity or enlarge the capacity of the economy. And as my colleague at the Centre for Future Work, Alison Pennington, noted: “If real wages had been growing, you would not need these one-off boosts to deal with rising petrol prices.” But when you spend your time in office actively working to keep wages growth down, that tends to come back to bite you when you are trying to convince voters that their standard of living is better than it was the last time they voted. Vote buying of course is not new but the slapdash nature of this is such that you almost wonder if they even bothered with the back of an envelope. Consider the $420 addition to the low and middle income tax offset – a figure transparently picked to get the overall LMITO maximum to a nice round $1,500. But the original offset maximum of $1,080 was tapered from those earning $90,000 down to zero for those earning $126,000. This is how most tax offset and government payments work. It means someone on $125,900 would have originally received an offset of just $3. This ensures you don’t actually lose out by earning more money. But the bonus to the LMITO is a flat $420 for everyone right up until $125,999. You earn that much – you get the $420 offset; earn $1 more and you get $0! It means every accountant this year will first and foremost be ensuring they get the taxable income of their high-paid clients below $126,000: If the graph does not display, click here It also means that people earning from $112,000 to $125,999 will receive a bigger tax cut from the extra offset than from the original LMITO. That’s some special level of “targeted” assistance! Of course, those on low incomes didn’t miss out. People on welfare payments are to receives a one-off $250, helpfully timed to arrive just as the election campaign is in full swing. And yet it really only serves to highlight how meagre the assistance is to those on jobseeker, for example. During the pandemic, the government boosted jobseeker because the politics of an extra million people suddenly realising what it is like to live in poverty was unpalatable. But such concerns are now gone and so too is the hope of getting through the week if you are on jobseeker. The extra $4.80 a week of this $250 effectively takes the jobseeker rate from being about 43.9% below the poverty line to being just 43.1% below – and only for this financial year: If the graph does not display, click here But someone on $120,000 will be getting an extra $420 a year, and because of the political impossibility of removing the LMITO, that will continue on – or at least until the stage three tax cuts kick in, bringing another $1,875 tax cut. But then perhaps this budget really has answered the question of who the government is – one that rushes to put a Band-Aid over long-term problems like real wage stagnation and when it thinks about providing relief to low-middle income earners it favours people earning $120,000 rather than someone on a payment of just $16,710.

3/31/2022,"Deliveroo’s chief executive, Will Shu, was handed a near 16% basic pay rise this year after taking home a £519,200 salary and £5.2m share payout last year. The takeaway courier boss will receive basic pay of £600,000 this year and is set to receive another near £5m of shares in April 2023, as part of a £30m package over the next six years, according to the group’s annual report published on Wednesday. Alex Marshall, the president of gig-workers union IWGB, criticised the large payouts, which came, he said, at a time when couriers – forced by Deliveroo to pay their own fuel and vehicle expenses – were facing an unprecedented increase in the cost of living and fuel. “These couriers put in a huge shift, working all through the pandemic to get food out to isolating families, but like many workers, they are paying for the price of the pandemic while bosses line their pockets,” he said. Deliveroo claims, based on a rider survey, that 85% of its riders globally are satisfied or very satisfied working for the company, adding that recruitment and retention rates had “remained robust” last year despite rising job vacancies in the UK and elsewhere. Shu’s latest rise in basic pay comes after a hefty 47% jump in basic pay between 2020 and last year as well as 33.3m of shares he received before the company listed on the stock market a year ago. That stock is worth almost £40m at today’s share price. The £5.2m in shares Shu received in December, and those positioned for April next year, are part of an additional 27.1m shares package lined up at the time of the initial public offering, and which is gradually being handed to him over the next six years. Those shares were worth £105.6m when first awarded but have dived in value since Deliveroo’s flotation in March to just over £30m at today’s share price. Shares have been hit by concerns about new EU rules on rights for gig economy workers that could increase costs for Deliveroo, as well as a general fall in tech stocks and concerns about the company’s ability to make a profit. The drop in Deliveroo’s share price has hit bonus payouts for Deliveroo’s chief financial officer Adam Miller as well as for Shu. Miller’s basic pay for this year has risen just over 14% to £500,000. He was also due an annual bonus worth 144% of his salary by the end of the year, half of which – £360,000 – has been paid in cash but half of which is paid in shares. However, Deliveroo’s board trimmed back the share bonuses by calculating the number of shares he should receive based on the 390p price at which the delivery company launched on the stock market rather than the 234p price at the time the bonus was awarded, effectively reducing the payout by 40%. Miller is also lined up for long term awards equivalent to up to 600% of his salary, but again the shares set aside, for the award which will vest based on performance over the next few years, have been cut by 40%.",News/Business,"Deliveroo CEO pay rises by 16% to £600,000 – plus £5m in shares",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/30/deliveroo-ceo-will-shu-pay-rises
3/31/2022,"This doesn’t usually happen: I’ve turned up to interview two people, and neither of them are here. Ed MacArthur, co-creator of String v Spitta, a hit comedy show about rival kids’ party hosts, has Covid, and is beaming into a Soho theatre meeting room via Zoom. Kiell Smith-Bynoe, his partner in crime, is wrapping up a 10-week shoot on series four of the sitcom Ghosts, and is running late. “I get the sense,” MacArthur says as we wait, “that Kiell was pretty elite.” We’re talking about their work in children’s entertainment. “He had his magic tricks and great costumes. Whereas I was just playing classical music and telling stories to babies.” That was back in the day, when MacArthur supported his fledgling performance career with “about 27 sidelines,” glorified childcare included. “It was usually just me and loads of au pairs who didn’t speak English. I found myself making jokes to a room of only children and people who didn’t understand what I was saying. Whereas Kiell was doing all the bells and whistles.” As if on cue, the Ghosts actor bustles in and says his hellos. Is it true, Kiell, that you were once the bells-and-whistles king of children’s entertainment? “I was getting kicked a lot,” he replies, flatly. “Let’s not forget that. I got kicked all the time.” String v Spitta launched at Soho theatre, London, just before Christmas, and was an instant hit – albeit after a long gestation period. MacArthur and Smith-Bynoe were introduced at the Edinburgh festival fringe in 2016, the latter pre-Ghosts and not long free of his side hustle with the kids’-party outfit Simply Smiley. Standout memories? “Bank of England governors day,” he recalls with a grimace, “when all the important people from the Bank of England are like, ‘do something with my kids!’ and then they get absolutely smashed.” When the duo discovered this shared history, they began plotting a comic two-hander about that under-explored world, one that drew on the lessons they learned while performing to infant audiences. “If you turn your back, their attention goes elsewhere,” says MacArthur. “So every moment has to be entertaining – and if not, why not? That’s quite a useful rule.” MacArthur and Smith-Bynoe are musicians, and soon they were cheerfully reworking children’s party songs for comic effect. “Which was cool,” says MacArthur, “because so many children’s songs are absolute bangers.” Characters emerged: Sylvester String, old-school kids’ entertainer and disciplinarian; and TikTok rapper Spitta, the new kid on the block, whose improvised grime stylings – not to mention the balloon animals (“I only remember how to do a dog,” says Smith-Bynoe, “or a giraffe, which is a dog with a long neck”) – the tots adore. As if channelling Sylvester String, MacArthur cites Peter Shaffer’s Amadeus as an influence. “I’m the posh Salieri establishment artist who takes the traditions of the art form incredibly seriously, and has great relationships with all these parents. Then in comes this absolute maverick who does not play by the rules, and disrupts everything.” Their December gigs (the run was curtailed by Omicron) told the story of the pair’s fractious relationship in flashback while they delivered their double-act to the offspring of Russian oligarchs – AKA, the audience. “When we realised we could treat an adult audience like children,” says MacArthur, “that was the big theatrical discovery.” Alongside the improvised rap battles, the repurposed Twinkle Twinkle Little Star and Heads, Shoulders, Knees and Toes, and the droll commentary on class rivalries in the capital, much of the considerable fun in String v Spitta is in reliving the children’s party experience as grownups. “Most of our audience and peers wouldn’t have been involved in a children’s party for 25 years,” says Smith-Bynoe. “It’s about nostalgia, and the excitement that this time around, we can do it with drink, be a bit naughty and shout back.” By popular demand, and assuming the pair ever get themselves back into the same room, the show returns next week for a short run. “We’ve got big plans for how we can make it step up,” says MacArthur. Smith-Bynoe raises an eyebrow. “Well, I’ve got big plans,” says MacArthur: “I just haven’t shared them with you yet.” One unavoidable tweak will be to the Russians-in-Kensington backdrop. “That world of the super-rich outdoing each other with the grandest children’s parties is going to feel way more red-hot than it did at Christmas.” “We’ve got two weeks to rewrite the whole show,” says Smith-Bynoe. “We’re thinking of writing a song called Londongrad Is Burning Down,” says MacArthur. Beyond that, the dream is the small screen: String v Spitta is already a few drafts into its TV treatment. “We’re really hoping we get to make it,” says Smith-Bynoe. “I adore doing the live show. It makes me laugh every night – seeing the responses from the audience, and the feeling of being kept on my feet. I’m having the time of my life doing it. But at the same time, I’d love to get some money for it, do you know what I mean?”  String v Spitta is at Soho theatre, London, 6-16 April.",Arts/Stage,‘A lot of kids’ songs are absolute bangers’: the comedy show about warring children’s entertainers,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/30/ed-macarthur-kiell-smith-bynoe-interview-string-v-spitta-childrens-entertainers
3/31/2022,"For more than a week after Russia invaded Ukraine, there was almost nothing else in the news. It was all we talked about on the radio, which felt right. Then I was on holiday for a week and off with Covid for a further week. When I was back presenting my programme on BBC Radio 5 live after this fortnight away, subjects other than Ukraine were in our running order. This was inevitable, I suppose, even though the situation in Ukraine was by then considerably more dire than it had been. Our coverage still dominated airtime, but, somehow, Ukraine could no longer have our undivided attention, because the story was no longer new. One atrocity followed another and steadily, appallingly, they lost the power to shock. The less new a story is, the less it counts as news. The clue, after all, is in the word itself. If you are in a cellar in Mariupol, you can’t move on; you can probably never move on. But the media have to move on; the “new” in news demands it. This is a real problem. It has always troubled me and I have no clue what the answer is. This week, riding from west London to Yorkshire on my motorbike, I did a long, not especially enjoyable, stretch on the M1. I love riding my bike – no telephone or radio, just you and the need to be hyperaware of the dangers around you. It’s mindful for me; a time to think. I got to thinking about Ukraine and the new in news and my mind turned, naturally enough, given what I was doing, to road accidents. Last year was a relatively light one for casualties, thanks to Covid restrictions and so on. Nevertheless, there were 580 deaths and 10,730 serious injuries. That is more than 11 deaths and 200 serious injuries a week. Unless they happen to be grouped together in an awful pile-up, or some other unusual factor is in play, these tragedies merit next to no mention beyond traffic reports lamenting the hold-ups caused. Road deaths aren’t new, ergo road deaths aren’t news. While this is startlingly obvious, the issue of what does and doesn’t make news could hardly be more serious. When the same awful thing happens often enough, it ceases to be unusual enough to merit mention. In this deafening silence surrounding the mundanity of tragedy, all manner of evil is able to proliferate. Domestic violence perpetrated by men against women is an obvious example. So much of it goes on that, for day-to-day reporting of it, you have to check your local press – if you still have any local press to refer to – and read as far as the “news in brief”. If a woman has harmed a man, of course, we will doubtless get to hear more about it. There is sexism in this, but what we might call “newism” is the critical factor. For a check on the history of the word “news”, I went, as I always do, to the etymologist Susie Dent. (My, how she must regret giving me her number.) She pointed me to etymonline.com: news (n) late 14c, “new things”, plural of new (n) “new thing” … after French nouvelles, which was used in Bible translations to render medieval Latin nova “news”, literally “new things”. So, news has always been about what is new or newsworthy – a word for which, Susie points out, the Oxford English Dictionary has citations dating back to 1596. This carries at least the implication that news should consist of what is worthy of mention, not merely what happens to be topical. Modern dictionary definitions of news and newsworthy tend to refer to them being about what is “interesting” to people, rather than what is “important”. There is a difference: the former generates more engagement, and therefore sales and clicks, than the latter. Many news organisations do everything they can to mitigate this, but the fight against human nature and our dwindling attention spans is a tough one. Domestic violence, knife crime and life-endangering waits for ambulances are three among many examples of stories that are not new enough to get anywhere near the coverage they need to bring about change. When this is pointed out, we tend to say something like: “God, yes, that’s true.” There is a worse category than this, though: the stories that elicit only a shrug, because, awful though they are, someone will merely say: “’Twas ever thus.” I promise you, pick your personal gripe about the state of the world and you will have yourself a good example of this. Access to legal justice is mine. We have this hard-wired notion in the UK that, if accused of something, we all deserve and would get a fair trial. Yet everyone in the business, by choice or otherwise, knows that justice is only open for all in the sense that the Ritz is open for all – it’s available to you only if you can afford it. An inner-city kid standing trial might not even meet his barrister until the first day in court. A kid whose family has plenty of dosh will have a team of lawyers working on his defence for months on end. Something is plainly wrong here, I might holler in despair. “’Twas ever thus,” someone will holler back. As long as we can focus on or care about only what is new, the ’twas-ever-thuses will grow. This is where newism, the fetishisation of the new in news, inevitably takes us.
