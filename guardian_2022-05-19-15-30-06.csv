5/19/2022,"Over two years into a global pandemic that’s killed more than 6 million people, infected over 500 million others and irrevocably changed the way we all live, work and interact, while some mourn and some continue to constantly readapt, for others, an investigation continues. How did we get here? What mistakes were made? And what can we learn? For those who survived another global health crisis decades prior, one with a far higher mortality rate but drastically lower visibility, many of these questions still remain. In the summer of 1981, a quietly alarming new illness started to afflict gay men, initially reported in localised gay media but soon covered in the New York Times with the still rather unforgettably chilling headline “Rare Cancer Seen in 41 Homosexuals”. In that year 234 people in the US died. In 1982, the CDC used the term Aids for the first time. By the end of the decade, over 100,000 Americans had died. “I think fear was the overwhelming feeling,” journalist Leon Neyfakkh said to the Guardian, having interviewed many who survived the era for the most recent season of his Fiasco podcast. “Just knowing that you might have it but you don’t know for sure and you might not know for months or years because for a long time there was no way to check while at the same time, all your friends were dying.” While there are many, still-to-be-unpacked problems with how the US and many other countries mishandled and continue to mishandle Covid-19, there has been at least some sense that it was being handled. But under Ronald Reagan’s administration, at a time when the majority of US states still upheld sodomy laws, dealing with a condition that mostly affected gay men, and then eventually needle-sharing drug users, was not seen as a priority. “Any time you’re talking about sex or drugs, it’s a moral issue, not a public health issue,” says Bill Clinton’s former surgeon general Joycelyn Elders on the podcast. Years later, Elders was one of many still sounding the alarm (before being abruptly and cruelly fired after insisting on more open and honest forms of sex education) but back then, it was left up to gay men, and then their devoted allies, to militarise, searching for the solutions that no one else was. They’re the heroes of the fifth season of Audible’s Fiasco, a dense and often devastating podcast docuseries devoted to clarifying the day-to-day realities of a particular historical event. Previous seasons have explored the Bush-Gore election of 2000 and the battle to desegregate Boston schools. “I don’t think we’ve ever made a season of our show that had a message with a capital M,” Neyfakh said over Zoom, eager not to position the show as a form of public service. “We’re always much more inclined to air out the complexities of these issues and let people present their point of view and explain where they’re coming from and let listeners take away what they will. We’re always trying to find the human beings who populated these stories and we want to defamiliarise them from the abstractions in which they generally come to us.” At the beginning, and for far too long after, a diagnosis was essentially a death sentence (it took until 1985 for an official test to even be available), and with little to no awareness of what it was and the specifics of how it was transmitted, gay men were forced into action even as their friends were disappearing around them. Neyfakh called it “a dichotomy of dread and mourning but paired with an irrepressible drive to survive and find a way out” and it’s something we see in both those that he speaks with and those who are no longer here with us but whose stories are shared. There was Michael Callen, a New York singer turned activist who worked alongside self-proclaimed “S&M hustler” Richard Berkowitz, to spread awareness amongst the dangerously uninformed gay community. Callen was diagnosed in 1982 at the age of 27 but alongside Berkowitz and with the directive help of doctor turned HIV/Aids researcher Joseph Sonnabend, spent the next decade, before his death at the age of 38, working on hugely important, and at the time unprecedented, pieces of work such as the foundational manual How to Have Sex in an Epidemic. But what Fiasco details is that trying to police the sex lives of gay men was an uphill battle and for understandable, often too easily simplified or harshly judged, reasons. “One thing I didn’t appreciate until we started working on this was the fact that this period followed an explosion of gay life,” Neyfakh said. “In New York and San Francisco and LA, gay liberation was in full swing when this began and there was a lot of resistance when Berkowitz and Callen started advocating for safe sex because it felt like turning the clock back, it wasn’t just about being told you had to stop your party, it felt for many that it was like being told that people had to conform to mainstream society in a way that was anathema to gay liberation.” One of the most interesting, and difficult, episodes zeroes in on the war over bathhouses in San Francisco. Once seen as a liberating space where gay men could express their sexual freedom, the rise of HIV quickly turned them into a potentially dangerous source of infection. While some, including many gay men, wanted them shut down, others insisted they remain open, viewing their closure as a dangerous step on the road toward recriminalising sodomy nationwide. For Neyfakh, “this debate of freedom vs public health obviously resonated” in the era of Covid and it also shone light on the complicated fissures that cracked open within the gay community. “There was just a total vacuum of knowledge and so it’s unsurprising that people had what turned out to be incorrect theories,” he said. For many, the broad strokes of what the Reagan administration did and most notably didn’t do will not be particularly revelatory but the quite literally lethal apathy from the first couple and those who worked alongside them remains shocking. Horrifying, recently unearthed audio footage is played from the very first time a journalist asked Reagan’s press secretary about the virus and is met with a quip before a dissolve into laughter. It took four years and the death of actor Rock Hudson to jolt them awake with Reagan finally saying Aids for the first time in late 1985. At the same time, the far-right were using the moment to continue pushing a homophobic agenda, led by televangelist Jerry Falwell’s Moral Majority, using words like “punishment” and “sin” to further isolate an already isolated community. “I think I didn’t quite appreciate until I started working on the series how perfectly Aids fit into the pre-existing prejudices that people had against gays and lesbians,” Neyfakh said. “It just triggered every specific hateful prejudice that people had about these people who were seen as so separate from the mainstream world.” What might be more revelatory to some is an episode that delves into the so-called “hemophilia holocaust” that saw the blood industry’s failure to take action result in 10,000 hemophiliacs infected through transfusions, more than half of their entire population in the US. “I think what shocked me maybe even more than the mere fact of the numbers was just how powerful the inertia was on the blood industry,” Neyfakh said. “Not changing practices and refusing to accept that their product, whether it was blood that was donated or plasma that was paid for, was suddenly essentially deadly and there were people trying to warn them and people trying to make proposals for how the product could be made safer. It felt like a story about more than just hemophilia or blood donation, it felt like a story about how institutions and industries close ranks and are resistant to change even in the face of emergency.” While great strides have been made, especially with regards to the life-saving “triple cocktail” of antiretroviral meds (which took until 1996 to be created), what’s most striking about the eight-episode season, is just how little so much has changed. In 2020, about 680,000 people died from Aids-related illnesses worldwide. There’s still no vaccine for HIV. Needle exchange programs remain effective but vilified. Sexual health and sex education are both still treated like moral issues. Communities of colour are still overwhelmingly more at risk. Anti-LGBTQ+ legislation is on the rise. If something like HIV were to strike again, would things be any different? “I think there’s just little reason to be optimistic,” Neyfakh said. “How easy it is for people, if it’s not in front of them, to just not think about it. I think that, paired with the homophobia it triggered, explains a lot of why there was so little public urgency around this disease and I think that would occur now, if you can put something out of sight, it’s very easy to not care.” All episodes of Fiasco are now available on Audible",Arts/Television & radio,‘All your friends were dying’: revisiting the horrors of the Aids crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/19/fiasco-audible-podcast-docuseries-aids-crisis
5/19/2022,"Football fans convicted of selling or taking class A drugs such as cocaine at matches could face five-year bans, the government has announced, in a bid to tackle rising violence and disruption. The new rules, announced on Thursday by the policing minister, Kit Malthouse, could also see anyone convicted ordered to surrender their passports when their team is playing abroad. Boris Johnson claimed the drug habits of “middle-class cokeheads” are driving crime across the UK, adding: “Their habit is feeding a war on our streets driving misery and crime across our country and beyond. “That’s why we are stepping up our efforts to make sure those who break the law face the full consequences – because taking illegal drugs is never a victimless crime.” The move is backed by the National Police Chiefs’ Council amid concerns that drug abuse is fuelling the rise in violence and disorder at matches. Statistics released by the UK football policing unit (UKFPU) in January reported an increase in arrests of 47% on the same period in the 2019-20 season, and a 36% increase in reports of disorder at matches. Almost a year ago, thousands of people without tickets tried to storm Wembley Stadium to watch England play Italy in the Euro 2020 final, and tens of thousands more created scenes of anarchic disorder on Olympic Way. According to bystanders, copious consumption of alcohol and cocaine was readily apparent. Malthouse said some football games have seen shocking “ugly violence”. “It’s been a thrilling football season, but at some games we’ve seen ugly violence that that has shocked all the leagues,” he said. “More and more the police are finding class A drugs at the heart of that disorder, and so we must act. The football family wants every ground to be a safe space for fans, especially children, and so do we.” He added that such bans have been successful in the past. “Football banning orders have been a gamechanger in rooting out racism and violence at football, and now we want them to do the same for drug-related disorder,” he said. “The government is determined to drive down drug use and bring home to all who take them that drugs bring consequences.”",Sport/Football,Football fans taking cocaine at matches face five-year bans,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/19/five-year-ban-fans-cocaine-football-matches
5/19/2022,"Several major UK fossil fuel projects have been approved since Cop26 concluded, an analysis has found, while about 50 schemes are thought to be in the pipeline between now and 2025. Three separate schemes have received some form of approval from government bodies during the six-month period since Boris Johnson’s administration hosted the UN climate summit in Glasgow. Campaigners say his government is reaching a crunch point, with three major onshore schemes currently being appealed and the levelling up minister, Michael Gove, set to rule on a number of such applications over the next six weeks. In January, ministers gave the green light to the Abigail oil and gas field off the east coast of Scotland, while a coal licence extension was granted in south Wales later that month. Plans to continue and expand oil production at West Newton, east Yorkshire, were then approved by local government in March. It is thought a large number of new North Sea oil and gas developments that hold a licence but have not yet received final consents could soon go ahead without undergoing the “climate compatibility” checks announced by the UK government last year, when other countries had ruled out issuing new oil and gas licences altogether. Analysis carried out by the climate campaigners Uplift suggests up to 46 such projects could be approved between 2022 and 2025. A new licensing round has been announced this autumn for offshore oil and gas, while ministers have spoken of “fast-tracking” fields amid escalating pressure within the cabinet and from backbench Conservative MPs over the government’s net zero plans. “In just six months the UK has gone from touting itself as a climate leader to championing fossil fuels, the very thing that is driving the climate emergency,” said Tessa Khan, director of Uplift. “It beggars belief. Expanding North Sea oil and gas means the UK – which still holds the Cop presidency – is now a dangerous climate wrecker.” Several major new fossil fuel infrastructure projects – two of them in Co Antrim, Northern Ireland – are also under consideration. Proposals for a gas storage facility under Larne Lough that could hold more than 25% of the UK’s gas supply and a new oil distribution terminal at Cloghan Point, near the village of Whitehead are facing grassroots opposition and a court challenge. Meanwhile, the Swiss energy company Trafigura is reportedly considering plans to reopen a gas terminal site in Middlesbrough. Meanwhile, a number of outstanding decisions on major new projects onshore and offshore are expected over the coming months. The west Cumbria coalmine and Jackdaw gas field applications are widely viewed as crucial tests signalling Whitehall’s direction of travel on new fossil fuel developments in view of its Cop26 pledges, with campaigners warning that a rush of new applications and licence approvals could be triggered if either goes ahead. The head of the International Energy Agency said last year that no new fossil fuel developments should go ahead if net zero global targets are to be reached by 2050. A new scientific study this week also found that nearly half of existing fossil fuel sites would need to be shut down early if global heating is to stay within the 1.5C global heating limit set by governments internationally. Competing pressures within Boris Johnson’s government that have intensified since the February invasion of Ukraine, placing ministers directly at odds with each other on energy policy. Citing the findings of the latest IPCC report, the cabinet minister and current Cop president, Alok Sharma, warned on Sunday that reneging on the agreements reached at Cop26 would be a “monstrous act of self-harm”. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, however, tweeted two days beforehand to vent his frustrations at young climate campaigners who had gatecrashed a Conservative party branch meeting he had attended in Folkestone. He wrote: “Shout and scream all you like, but I’m not going to put Britain’s energy security at risk by shutting off domestic oil and gas production. “We will need oil and gas for decades to come. Either we source more of what we need from the North Sea, or import more from abroad.” Lauren McDonald, 21, one of the campaigners who confronted Kwarteng last week, said: “Kwasi Kwarteng is arguably the most powerful figure within the government when it comes to pushing forward on the UK’s climate goals. “He has the power to stop new fossil fuels, to act with the science and to put his foot down – many of these decisions ultimately lie with him.” A government spokesperson said: “As Putin continues to use gas as a geopolitical weapon, we make no apology whatsoever for sourcing more of the oil and gas Britain needs from within our own territorial waters. “We have clearly outlined our transition from hydrocarbons to clean energy and the British energy security strategy sets out how we will accelerate this through cheap renewables, betting big on new nuclear and maximising domestic production of gas in the North Sea.”",News/Environment,"UK has approved several fossil fuel projects since Cop26, analysis finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/19/uk-has-approved-several-fossil-fuel-projects-since-cop26-analysis-finds
5/19/2022,"What were they thinking? That’s what customers, restaurants, and delivery workers want to know after a surprise promotion by food delivery platform Grubhub went badly awry – and proved there’s really no such thing as a free lunch. Grubhub’s plan was ambitious: to feed everyone in New York City and the surrounding Tri-State area for free, during lunch hours on Tuesday. The platform cited a survey it had conducted that found that 69% of working New Yorkers said they had skipped lunch. But that’s exactly what the stunt ended up doing, after Grubhub’s platform crashed as New Yorkers rushed to place orders. The fiasco left restaurants overwhelmed, delivery workers frustrated, and many customers with empty stomachs. Christopher Krautler, a spokesperson for Grubhub, said the platform was averaging up to 6,000 orders a minute, which “absolutely blew away all expectations”. Krautler acknowledged that the demand “initially caused a temporary delay in our system and some users experienced an error message with their code, but that was quickly rectified”, adding the platform fulfilled more than 450,000 lunch orders connected to the promotion. But many users never saw their food after spending money, with some kept hungry and waiting for hours by the app’s promises that the food would soon arrive. The app was offering $15 off of any order made in the New York City area between 11am and 2pm. Restaurants across the city were inundated. Fee Bakhtiar, a general manager at Jajaja Mexicana in West Village, called it a “shitshow”. When she opened the restaurant at 11.30am, she was stunned to find 40 orders from Grubhub already waiting in the queue. “I was like, wait, this can’t be real. And then all of a sudden, it was just kind of like, ‘Oh well, I guess it is real.’” Bakhtiar said Jajaja West Village, which focuses on takeout, was able to fulfill all of its Grubhub orders – which suddenly disappeared at 2pm. “But it would’ve just been nice if we had a heads up.” She told the Guardian that neither she nor the managers at Jajaja’s other locations in New York received an email or a mobile notification from the platform warning that the promotion would happen. @Grubhub you didn’t communicate with businesses. In fact you didn’t even ask if we wanted to participate in this. Today you threatened our reputation and violated our boundaries. Pay us the money you stole from us today. #dontbuyongrubhub But many restaurants were unable to cope. Megan Benson, a worker at a fast casual chicken restaurant in Brooklyn, said that the flood of lunch orders created shortages that spilled over into dinnertime, turning the kitchen into a “war zone”. The restaurant is “typically busy from the moment we open the door, and nobody told us about this this free lunch thing”, she said. “Normally it’s a tight ship in there, but we couldn’t keep up. We had no time to restock anything, so half the stuff was missing or sold out.” “The phone wouldn’t stop ringing because people were calling mad as hell to tell us that they were missing items, or they just never got their food picked up, so the Grubhub delivery guys would have to keep coming back. “Eventually my co-workers just just got irate with phones constantly being shoved in their faces. Believe me when I say fights almost broke out.” Toward the end of the shift, the kitchen was down to just Benson and another co-worker, who struggled to stay afloat. “It was just too much, and I had to keep reminding myself out loud, ‘I’m just one person,’ because I had to take the orders and make the orders while my co-worker did all the overflowing Grubhub orders. There was nowhere to put them, either.” What Grubhub’s free lunch campaign actually looks like pic.twitter.com/Jfw4u2dRvi The delays meant Benson had to stay well past midnight to clean up, and she finally got home at 3.30am. “I just hope we get overtime pay this week,” she said. Krautler said that Grubhub “gave advance notice to all restaurants in our network, which included multiple forms of communications across email and in-platform …even with that preparation, no one could anticipate the level of demand and unfortunately that caused strain on some restaurants”. It wasn’t much better for customers some of whom still ended up out of pocket from the “free” promotion. Chloe Brailsford, a comic artist who moved to Brooklyn last year, was quarantining at home with Covid and decided to use Grubhub for the first time after learning about the promotion from a friend. By the time she logged on shortly after 1pm, she noticed that many of the restaurants on the app had marked themselves as “closed”. At first, she tried Taco Bell, but a notification popped up as she was ordering, saying the restaurant was no longer available. Then she managed to find an Ihop that was still taking orders, with a delivery estimate of 45 to 55 minutes. It took two tries to put through her request for a Belgian waffle combo and hash browns – which, even after the discount, still cost $22.26 including delivery fees. “(The app) said it would arrive between 2.59pm and 3.09pm. And I was like, that’s a lot longer than 45 minutes.” By 5pm, Brailsford still didn’t have any food. She watched the estimated arrival change to 8pm: “I was like, what the fuck is happening?” She tried calling Grubhub’s customer support, but sat on hold for more than half an hour before giving up and going to the grocery store to buy her dinner: a can of Progresso soup. Krautler did not respond to a question about whether customers such as Brailsford would receive their money back. I tried to pick up my regular lunch order at sweetgreen today and it was absolute insanity. The workers shouldn't have to suffer this nonsense, shame on GrubHub. pic.twitter.com/3uB5j0DQRO For delivery workers, the promotion was a mixed bag. According to Krautler, Grubhub increased its incentives to workers to support the demand, and drivers “generally made two to three times more than usual during the promotion”. Two delivery workers told the Guardian they made higher than usual earnings as Grubhub spammed their phones begging them to come online: one worker, Artemiy Isakov, said the bonuses helped him make about $500 over six hours of work. Another worker, Maurice Jamison, said he pulled in $300 across breakfast, lunch, and dinner. But other workers – including some thousands of miles away from New York – reported not being able to log on at all as the app strained under demand. One Grubhub worker in California told the Guardian that his app “froze multiple times and completely stopped working” during the time of the New York free lunch promo; he was only able to complete three deliveries during eight hours online, netting him just $28 for the day. Grubhub: we’re offering free lunch in the the most over populated cityThe app 5 minutes into the promo: pic.twitter.com/kGR0nSGu3L As Grubhub’s systems heaved, it outsourced some orders to third-party delivery platforms, which quickly became affected as well. A worker for Relay, a New York City-based delivery platform, told the Guardian that soon after using the promotion as a customer to get a free sandwich, he noticed orders began to pile up in his courier app. The worker, who asked not to be identified, said one order he was assigned to pick up was missing. Relay’s app requires workers to contact their support line to report order issues, but nobody picked up after more than 30 minutes of waiting. After unassigning himself from the order, he received another order, which the restaurant had no record of on their system. “Again after waiting 30 minutes for help from Relay, I got nothing. The app rates your performance, and unassigning yourself affects your rating, so I’m very hesitant to do it. I’ve gotten a warning already. “I better not get punished for this,” the worker said. “Relay was absolutely not prepared.” Relay did not respond to a request for comment. Hildalyn Colon-Hernandez, the policy director at Los Deliveristas Unidos, a labor group representing New York City delivery workers, said that as Grubhub’s app sputtered out yesterday, many workers were left holding orders in their hands, unable to deliver. “Sometimes the workers show up to the restaurant, and the restaurants have not even received the order from the app,” she said. “That leads to a confrontation, because the workers are like, ‘I’m already on the clock, I need to get there on time, but the restaurant is already packed.’ And when they deliver to the customers, they’re saying, ‘I’ve been waiting for this for two hours.’” Brailsford, who is still waiting for reimbursement for her failed Ihop order, doesn’t blame New Yorkers for the chaos: “People saw a deal, and they wanted it, because who the fuck in this goddamn economy doesn’t want to save some money on food?” But she has harsher words for Grubhub. “You could’ve thought about this for any longer than half a second, and you might’ve realized what kind of terrible idea you were doing.”",News/US news,‘This can’t be real’: Grubhub promotion turns New York City restaurants into a ‘war zone’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/18/this-cant-be-real-grubhub-promotion-turns-new-york-city-restaurants-into-a-war-zone
5/19/2022,"For the past few years, scientists have been frantically sounding an alarm that governments refuse to hear: the global food system is beginning to look like the global financial system in the run-up to 2008. While financial collapse would have been devastating to human welfare, food system collapse doesn’t bear thinking about. Yet the evidence that something is going badly wrong has been escalating rapidly. The current surge in food prices looks like the latest sign of systemic instability. Many people assume that the food crisis was caused by a combination of the pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine. While these are important factors, they aggravate an underlying problem. For years, it looked as if hunger was heading for extinction. The number of undernourished people fell from 811 million in 2005 to 607 million in 2014. But in 2015, the trend began to turn. Hunger has been rising ever since: to 650 million in 2019, and back to 811 million in 2020. This year is likely to be much worse. Now brace yourself for the really bad news: this has happened at a time of great abundance. Global food production has been rising steadily for more than half a century, comfortably beating population growth. Last year, the global wheat harvest was bigger than ever. Astoundingly, the number of undernourished people began to rise just as world food prices began to fall. In 2014, when fewer people were hungry than at any time since, the global food price index stood at 115 points. In 2015, it fell to 93, and remained below 100 until 2021. Only in the past two years has it surged. The rise in food prices is now a major driver of inflation, which reached 9% in the UK last month. Food is becoming unaffordable even to many people in rich nations. The impact in poorer countries is much worse. So what has been going on? Well, global food, like global finance, is a complex system, that develops spontaneously from billions of interactions. Complex systems have counterintuitive properties. They are resilient under certain conditions, as their self-organising properties stabilise them. But as stress escalates, these same properties start transmitting shocks through the network. Beyond a certain point, a small disturbance can tip the entire system over its critical threshold, whereupon it collapses, suddenly and unstoppably. We now know enough about systems to predict whether they might be resilient or fragile. Scientists represent complex systems as a mesh of nodes and links. The nodes are like the knots in an old-fashioned net; the links are the strings that connect them. In the food system, the nodes include the corporations trading grain, seed and farm chemicals, the major exporters and importers and the ports through which food passes. The links are their commercial and institutional relationships. If the nodes behave in a variety of ways, and their links to each other are weak, the system is likely to be resilient. If certain nodes become dominant, start to behave in similar ways and are strongly connected, the system is likely to be fragile. In the approach to the 2008 crisis, the big banks developed similar strategies and similar ways of managing risk, as they pursued the same sources of profit. They became strongly linked to each other in ways that regulators scarcely understood. When Lehman Brothers failed, it threatened to pull everyone down. So here’s what sends cold fear through those who study the global food system. In recent years, just as in finance during the 2000s, key nodes in the food system have swollen, their links have become stronger, business strategies have converged and synchronised, and the features that might impede systemic collapse (“redundancy”, “modularity”, “circuit breakers” and “backup systems”) have been stripped away, exposing the system to “globally contagious” shocks. On one estimate, just four corporations control 90% of the global grain trade. The same corporations have been buying into seed, chemicals, processing, packing, distribution and retail. In the course of 18 years, the number of trade connections between the exporters and importers of wheat and rice doubled. Nations are now polarising into super-importers and super-exporters. Much of this trade passes through vulnerable chokepoints, such as the Turkish Straits (now obstructed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine), the Suez and Panama canals and the Straits of Hormuz, Bab-el-Mandeb and Malacca. One of the fastest cultural shifts in human history is the convergence towards a “Global Standard Diet”. While our food has become locally more diverse, globally it has become less diverse. Just four crops – wheat, rice, maize and soy – account for almost 60% of the calories grown by farmers. Their production is now highly concentrated in a handful of nations, including Russia and Ukraine. The Global Standard Diet is grown by the Global Standard Farm, supplied by the same corporations with the same packages of seed, chemicals and machinery, and vulnerable to the same environmental shocks. The food industry is becoming tightly coupled to the financial sector, increasing what scientists call the “network density” of the system, making it more susceptible to cascading failure. Around the world, trade barriers have come down and roads and ports upgraded, streamlining the global network. You might imagine that this smooth system would enhance food security. But it has allowed companies to shed the costs of warehousing and inventories, switching from stocks to flows. Mostly, this just-in-time strategy works. But if deliveries are interrupted or there’s a rapid surge in demand, shelves can suddenly empty. A paper in Nature Sustainability reports that in the food system, “shock frequency has increased through time on land and sea at a global scale”. In researching my book Regenesis, I came to realise that it’s this escalating series of contagious shocks, exacerbated by financial speculation, that has been driving global hunger. Now the global food system must survive not only its internal frailties, but also environmental and political disruptions that might interact with each other. To give a current example, in mid-April, the Indian government suggested that it could make up the shortfall in global food exports caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Just a month later, it banned exports of wheat, after crops shrivelled in a devastating heatwave. We urgently need to diversify global food production, both geographically and in terms of crops and farming techniques. We need to break the grip of massive corporations and financial speculators. We need to create backup systems, producing food by entirely different means. We need to introduce spare capacity into a system threatened by its own efficiencies. If so many can go hungry at a time of unprecedented bounty, the consequences of the major crop failure that environmental breakdown could cause defy imagination. The system has to change.

5/19/2022,"In the aftermath of the racist shooting that killed 10 on Saturday in Buffalo, the director of the New York State Council of Churches, the Rev Peter Cook, has been a constant presence at prayer gatherings and public memorials. The organization he leads represents eight denominations to New York state government; and he has the ear of political leaders, including Governor Kathy Hochul, in shaping the political response to a massacre that targeted the Black community of East Buffalo – one that has been met with expressions of faith alongside anger and distress. Cook’s message is that it’s the responsibility of white Christian denominations to challenge white America’s relationship with God and guns that is intertwined with white supremacy. According to online postings, the alleged shooter, Payton Gendron, wanted to fashion America as a white-dominated, Christian nation. Such extreme conservative views developed over time from President Nixon’s “southern strategy” to increase political support among white voters in the south by appealing to racism against Black people, tough-on-crime policies and anti-abortion sentiments. According to Cook, guns became ensnared in the strategy. “It really gave tacit cultural permission to people of faith to own guns, so they conveniently worked their way into this religious freedom argument and conflated it with Christianity itself,” Cook said on Wednesday. “It doesn’t have any theological integrity to it at all, but we use the language of faith to acquire power and to further white supremacist notions.” Drawing attention to the marriage between faith and guns comes with political risk, as the then Democratic party presidential hopeful Barack Obama found in 2008 when, in an unscripted moment, he took aim at white working-class voters in old industrial towns decimated by job losses. “They get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren’t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations,” Obama said in remarks that his rivals pounced on. How to detach gun ownership from being a marker of Christian faithfulness, and the accompanying politicization, concerns Cook. Without knowing Gendron’s faith background, he said the accused shooter “really stepped into that political slew of white nationalists, another derivation of the southern strategy, advanced also in … looking to preserve the sense of a white, Christian nation and of the original founders being white, Christian men, being representative of what America is”. Some Black churches, Cook said, have had to accommodate the language of things like “tough on crime”, and the increase in mass incarceration under Bill Clinton, in order to maintain their own political influence and power. East Buffalo has suffered from discriminatory lending practices, poor health outcomes, high rates of maternal death, lesser investment in schools, food deserts and highways driven through Black neighborhoods to connect white people from one place to another. In the Buffalo massacre’s aftermath, most denominations have come out with strong statements against violence and are advocating for federal legislation to require a universal gun background check, prohibit purchasing firearms at gun shows and ban semi-automatic weapons. In New York, they are pushing for legislation to stop guns from being imported from states with laxer gun laws. “I think for the church, with a number of exceptions because gun culture infuses Christianity, we need the strongest gun laws we can think of,” Cooks says. “We don’t think much of the second amendment.” Attempts to forge stronger relationships between churches and gun control advocates have proceeded slowly. Two years ago, Everytown for Gun Safety began an interfaith effort with more than a dozen religious leaders to boost election turnout in support of candidates who support anti-gun violence measures. The group’s partners include representatives from Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu and Sikh backgrounds. “Churches, especially white evangelical churches, have largely ignored this question – I think, much to their own detriment and to the detriment of the people they’re called to serve,” said the Rev Rob Schenck at the time. Schenck, a former evangelical anti-abortion activist who shifted to support abortion rights, described gun violence as a “life-or-death issue”, making it essential to include gun control in “pro-life” agendas. Others who have taken up that call include the Rev Traci Blackmon, who became prominent after police fatally shot Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. Blackmon is expected in Buffalo this weekend as the funerals of the Tops Friendly Market shooting victims begin. Cook said he was appalled when a church in his region held a fundraising raffle for an AK-47. The effort to detach guns from faith within church leadership and congregations may need an assertive voice which links pastoral care to larger structural questions while being resilient to inevitable political pushback. Cook alluded to Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the German Lutheran pastor and theologian who opposed the Nazis. “It’s going to come from a lot of conversation and teaching within the church and really getting people within the faith to act on their faith and really weigh in on these policy questions,” Cook said. “That’s a really hard thing to do, but I think if there were more people within our congregations who paid attention to this stuff and really put the pressure on Congress and their legislators to pass tough gun laws that could be really important.” But Cook concedes that could be tough. “It starts with straight-up, honest conversations within our churches and getting people to get out of their pews, get out here, and show up at rallies, be present and listen to people, listen to their pain,” Cook said. “A lot of times churches can be a little insular. “We’re debating what color we should have for the carpet and what kind of coffee we’re going to serve at coffee hour. We’ll preach about loving thy neighbor and non-violence, but how that really translates to people’s personal and collective lives is complicated.”",News/US news,The Christian leader trying to break America’s link between faith and guns,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/19/buffalo-shooting-peter-cook-christians-guns
5/19/2022,"When Leon Martin asked for his parents’ advice on how to pursue his dream of becoming a UX designer, they were flummoxed. “I literally didn’t have the first idea what he was talking about,” said Anne, his mother. “I didn’t know whether he was talking about designing clothes, computer programmes or a fancy new brand of mountain bike.” Even when 18-year-old Leon explained that the role was to do with “behind the scenes” online design, his mother floundered. “I felt like I’d totally failed as a parent,” she said. “My job as a parent is to open doors so my children can achieve their potential, but how can I do that when I don’t even understand what their ambitions are?” Anne isn’t alone. Research has found that more than two-thirds of parents of 11- to 18-year-olds in England are lost in a “job fog”, feeling overwhelmed as their children express interest in careers they know nothing about. The situation isn’t helped by the number of new career and education options available to young people. More than 75% of parents felt that giving relevant career advice to their children was almost impossible in such a fast-changing jobs market. Michelle Rea, from Talking Futures, which carried out the survey of more than 2,000 parents of secondary school pupils in England, said parents were concerned that their lack of knowledge could hinder career conversations. “All the evidence points to the pivotal role parents’ attitudes and opinions play in shaping and influencing their children’s education and career choices,” she said. “The temptation is to stick with what we feel most confident talking about, and that’s usually what we know and have experienced ourselves. But things have changed since most of us were at school.” Bryony Mathew, a neuroscientist, British ambassador and author of Qubits and Quiver Trees: Awesome Careers of the Future, said the world was changing so rapidly that parents should not try to identify specific careers for their children. “Children in primary school today will one day take on careers that don’t yet exist, and each child won’t have just one career but lots of different careers,” she said. “This means that parents should be encouraging their children to learn a wide mixture of art, science, computing and coding, so that they can find or create their own niches. Parent can’t possibly teach a child what their niche is in such a fast-moving world; it’s something the young person has to discover themselves.” Shamajul Motin, an educational consultant for The Prospects Group, an education, employment, training service, said he spent most of his time talking to parents who did not understand their children’s career choices. “For example, we have loads of young people who want to be streamers, and the parents are like: ‘How is that a real job when all they do is play computer games all day? How are they going to make a living out of that?’” he said. “But the parent doesn’t realise that the child actually can not only make a lot of money from doing exactly that – but go on to gain the attention of a big gaming company and then be employed by them. The world of work has changed and it’s taking parents time to realise that.” UX designer User experience design is the process of creating evidence-based designs for products or websites.

5/19/2022,"Conflict and violence forced people from their homes a record number of times last year, a report has found, with sub-Saharan Africa bearing the brunt of mass internal displacement caused by “huge spikes” in fighting. People fleeing violence were internally displaced 14.4m times in 2021, an increase of 4.6m on 2020, according to figures published by the Norwegian Refugee Council’s Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC). Most of those displacements – 11.6m, or 80% of the total – took place in sub-Saharan African countries, with the war in northern Ethiopia dwarfing other conflicts in terms of the number of times people were forced from their homes. Alexandra Bilak, IDMC director, said the geographic concentration of the conflict-related displacement across sub-Saharan Africa, from the Sahel to east Africa, was a huge concern. “These are, of course, countries that have experienced long histories of conflict, but what these numbers show is that the conflicts are far from having been resolved,” she said. “So on top of protracted crises, you get new waves of violence every year. In Ethiopia and Burkina Faso, we’re talking huge spikes of new violence that have led to incredibly large numbers being displaced and, at least for now, very little prospect for returns.” New flare-ups of violence often collided with climate pressures such as drought or flooding, and resulting food insecurity, making it even harder for countries to give internally displaced people (IDPs) the help they needed, she said. “There’s absolutely no window during which some kind of stabilisation could happen, and some degree of return or sustainable local integration. These constant shocks to the system mean that the numbers keep increasing.” According to the report, there were 59.1 million IDPs globally in 2021, a cumulative figure, which has grown steadily since the IDMC began documenting in 2003. Every year more displacement is caused by natural disasters than conflict, but last year the number of forced movements due to disasters such as such as storms, floods and volcanic eruptions – 23.7 million – was down considerably on 2020. The number of times people were forced from their homes by violence was of particular concern to the IDMC. As the report deals with 2021, the figures do not include the huge humanitarian fallout from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where more than 7 million people are thought to be internally displaced. The only place to rival that scale of displacement was Ethiopia, where conflict – chiefly war between government forces and Tigrayan rebels in the north of the country – triggered 5.1m internal displacements. Until the invasion of Ukraine, that was the highest annual figure ever recorded for a single country. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which saw 2.7m displacements due to conflict, and Afghanistan, where the Taliban toppled Ashraf Ghani’s government, also registered all-time highs. The volatile situation in Myanmar, where the military staged a bloody coup, helped triple the overall figure for east Asia compared with the previous year. With more than half the global IDP population under 25, and about 25 million under 18, the IDMC called for more targeted interventions to protect children and young people from the particular dangers they face. “The financial difficulties IDPs tend to face may force children to engage in dangerous income-generating activities, including crime, transactional sex or joining armed groups,” the report notes. “Strengthening child protection systems that consider these risks is essential.” Displaced girls and boys, it adds, confront different risks, with girls at greater risk of sexual violence and child marriage, and boys of recruitment by fighters. Bilak hoped the report would raise awareness of the worsening plight of IDPs, which historically had received “much less attention” from governments and policymakers than that of refugees or migrants. “This is, first and foremost, a call for acknowledgment of the scale … and the urgency of the issue,” she said. Faced with the stark increase in conflict-related displacement, she added, the IDMC urged greater investment in peace-building, “and in preventing those conflicts from happening in the first place”.",News/Global development,‘Huge spike’ in global conflict caused record number of displacements in 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/may/19/huge-spike-in-global-conflict-caused-record-number-of-displacements-in-2021
5/19/2022,"My sister-in-law has had a prepayment electricity meter for more than 20 years. Late last year, her supplier, E.ON, started sending letters claiming she was more than £1,000 in debt. She spent hours on the phone arguing that was impossible, until a call-centre agent worked out that when a new meter was installed in 2018, the serial number had been incorrectly recorded by the engineer. As a result, her payment top-ups were not registering. The agent advised her to top up the meter with £1 on three consecutive days to “reset” it and remove the debt. She also sent £25 in compensation. But the debt letters still rained down, culminating in a demand that she pay £5 per week to pay off a debt that it now put at £1,103. We remonstrated with E.ON, which again admitted the error, but since then we’ve heard nothing.AR, Cumbria Mistakes happen, but outrageously in this case, E.ON identified the error, then failed to do anything about it.

5/19/2022,"Lying back on the grass, I exhaled for what seemed like the first time in 18 months. I was miles away from civilisation and a world away from the long days of solo lockdown in my London flat. Now I was alone again, but in happier circumstances. I could hear faraway sheep and feel a gentle breeze as I gazed at the Lake District countryside and sky. I was a few days into walking from Cumbria’s Irish Sea shores to the North Sea on the Coast to Coast, a network of paths created by Alfred Wainwright, and it was absolute bliss. It was September 2021 and while the world was slowly getting back to “normal”, mine had imploded four months earlier when my mum died after a short illness. At her funeral the vicar and my uncle talked about my mum’s gritty determination and resilience. It was entrenched in me, too, but the past 18 months had taken its toll: was the fight still there? Time to find out. The Coast to Coast wasn’t my first long-distance trail – but it’s not to be underestimated. Over 12 days I crawled up formidable mountains, scrambled down rockfaces, scaled drystone walls, soaked my tired feet in ice-cold streams, negotiated bogs and mires, and tried to face my fear of cows (they’ve been known to kill hikers, you know). I kept walking. The Coast to Coast is officially 192 miles long, and my itinerary was ambitious, averaging about 16 miles a day, with no rest days. Admittedly, I wasn’t carrying all my gear, or camping – my suitcase was on its own journey from hotel to hotel. All I had to do was put one foot in front of the other and keep going. While at times my hike was solo, contemplative and a chance to think about my mum; at others it was a riotous jolly jaunt of English eccentricity, the comradeship of fellow hikers and the kindness of strangers. I was halfway between St Bees and Ennerdale Bridge on the first day when I spotted a plastic bag with my name on, hanging on a gate: “For Emma Lunn and bear. Have a great trip.” The bear was my trusty travelling companion, Arnie, a teddy my nephew had given me a decade earlier. The bag contained a variety of sugary snacks and had been left by a kind local in response to an introductory post I’d written on the Coast to Coast Facebook group the previous night. My gratitude was captured on film by the Stockton Ramblers – a vivacious trio of fellow hikers I regularly fell into pace with along the way, who were making a video blog of their adventure. I needed the sugar hit the following day when I opted for the “high route” from Ennerdale Bridge to Seatoller. My calves were on fire during the relentless climb to the 755-metre Red Pike, during which I entered a semi-meditative state where I’d count 100 painful steps before allowing myself to stop for a breather, check my GPS, then repeat. With sheep paths crossing my uphill route and the summit shrouded in mist, the going was tough and navigation difficult. Red Pike was phenomenal and worth the exertion. The clouds cleared moments after I collapsed, dog-tired, yet exhilarated, at the summit. It was the first time I’d reached a spot that gave me a sense of the sheer scale of the Lake District, with Derwentwater, Crummock Water and Ennerdale Water, and others, all in view. From the top of Red Pike begins something of a classic Lake District ridge ramble to the summits of High Stile and Haystacks. My GPS failed as I scrambled up and over rocks and slid down scree-covered slopes, aimlessly trying to get back on anything resembling a path while my water supplies ran low in the soaring heat. The Coast to Coast delivered regular doses of euphoria, each time I conquered a summit, survived a dangerous ascent, passed through a field of cows without incident, or simply survived another day. Despite a decent level of fitness, sometimes I could barely stand by the time I reached my B&B or hotel. I got lucky with the weather. It only rained for about 30 minutes during my entire trip. But while I lamented not packing enough summer clothes, some walkers dispensed of clothes altogether. I was at the summit of Kidsty Pike, at 780 metres, when my fellow hikers and I collectively averted our eyes as a middle-aged man wearing nothing but hiking boots and a backpack strolled up to the summit. The jury was out on whether it was the infamous Naked Rambler (former marine Stephen Gough), or just a random hiker who found the heat too much. Despite being the most popular long-distance trail in the UK, the Coast to Coast is neither a designated national trail nor signposted. The traditional route mapped out by fellwalker and writer Alfred Wainwright winds through three of England’s most stunning national parks. Traditionally walked west to east, it starts at St Bees, near Whitehaven, before traversing the dramatic mountains and valleys of the Lake District, the rolling fields of the Yorkshire Dales, and the bleak yet remarkable North York Moors. It ends at the picturesque fishing village of Robin Hood’s Bay. Some hikers carry all their gear, and camp; a mad minority run it in record-breaking attempts. Others pootle happily from pub to pub over 15 or 16 days, taking several rest days. I paid Mac’s Adventures to take care of the logistics, with night stops varying from the swanky Glaramara House Hotel in Borrowdale and walkers’ retreat New Ing Lodge in Shap, to a room above the Arncliffe Arms in Glaisdale. Tradition dictates that anyone embarking on the Coast to Coast walk starts by dipping a toe in the Irish Sea at St Bees and choosing a pebble to throw in the North Sea at Robin Hood’s Bay. I dispensed of my pebble before I checked in to Lee-Side, a charming B&B in Robin Hood’s Bay with just four rooms (from £60 single). A woman about my age and her mum checked in at the same time as me, and the B&B owners greeted us with coffee and cake. I couldn’t help but feel envious that the other woman’s mum was still with her – then I remembered that my mum had been with me too, every step of the way. TrainingDepending on your itinerary, you’ll be walking 13 to 16 miles a day, for up to 10 hours, often uphill. To train you should practise walking this distance on consecutive days. If you plan to carry all your gear, you should take it on your training walks too. Hiking poles are advisable – your knees will thank you. ProvisionsWalkers should take sufficient food and water each day. Some days you’ll pass through villages with shops and pubs, but on others you might be dependent on “honesty boxes” at farms and churches where you are expected to leave the right money in exchange for snacks and drinks. PackagesMacs Adventures can design tailor-made self-guided trips for solo walkers, couples and groups, with rest days as required. Prices start from £1,149 a person for 12 nights, and include accommodation, GPS routes, luggage transfer and taxis, if accommodation is off the route. Other firms offering self-guided Coast to Coast itineraries include Mickledore and Contours Holidays. If you want to book your own accommodation, Sherpavan and Packhorse both offer daily luggage transfers. Campers will need to book at designated campsites – wild camping isn’t allowed. Public transportBecause the route takes you from one side of England to the other, the best way to travel is by public transport. You can get a train to St Bees from London, via Carlisle. Robin Hood’s Bay doesn’t have a train station, so you’ll need to get a bus to Whitby or Scarborough for rail connections. If you drive, Packhorse offers secure car parking in Kirkby Stephen (about halfway) and offers transfers to St Bees and back from Robin Hood’s Bay. SafetySolo walkers should always let a friend or family member know the route they intend to take each day and roughly how long it will take. GPS navigation is easy to follow but reliant on your phone – take a map and compass for back-up and make sure you know how to use it. Stop and chat to any other hikers you meet. Not only is it nice to be sociable, but if you go missing people you’ve spoken to are more likely to remember what time and where they saw you. Pack an emergency foil blanket – these are cheap and lightweight and can keep you warm if you have to spend the night outside. Finally, know your limits. If you’ve never climbed a mountain before, it’s best to do it with someone else before you attempt a summit alone.",Lifestyle/Travel,‘I was dog-tired but exhilarated’: hiking the UK’s Coast to Coast route,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/may/19/walking-the-coast-to-coast-solo-female-lake-district-north-yorkshire
5/19/2022,"Novels. Why do I read them? My reading was at its most voracious when I was a kid. I suspect this was because my only purpose was enjoyment and escapism. From all 21 Famous Five stories – in order, naturally – to Anna Karenina, stuffed into a pannier on a cycling holiday, I was transported. Then, for A-levels and a degree, I read to pass exams. Slowly, tellingly, the joy faded. And I was no good at the exams either. When those last exams were done, more than 30 years ago, I was done with novels. I had fallen out of love. Gradually, it has come back, but it’s all different now. I find I’m reading whole novels mainly to unearth little jewels of wisdom to shed light on what I’ve been feeling; feelings that I’ve been unable to articulate myself. For some reason I picked up The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. A bit flabby in the middle, if I may say so, but generally I was transfixed by what started to seem like the greatest love story ever told. The plot soon starts to fade, and all you are left with is how it made you feel. This is nice, but what makes it all worthwhile is those specific insights that I make sure to harvest and go back to. For instance, Helen says of her new life in the big city: “At first, I was delighted with the novelty and excitement of our London life; but soon I began to weary of its mingled turbulence and constraint.” A few months later, I chanced upon Anne Brontë’s resting place in Scarborough. Standing over her grave, I looked up this little passage and appreciated anew how intensely it resonated with my own feelings about London. And there the poor young woman lay, gone 173 years and still making new friends. That’s quite something.

5/19/2022,"Good morning, and here’s a riddle to start your day: what needs fuel in its tank, but also has to be balanced? What will turn into a black hole if we don’t fix its roof when the sun is shining? What will max out its credit card if we don’t live within our means? The answer, of course, is not a motorhome floating through space and brandishing a Visa, but the economy – or, more accurately, the economy as Conservatives think about it. From Margaret Thatcher to Boris Johnson via David Cameron and George Osborne, all of those visions of the limits on the state’s financial firepower are framed by the right. All of them rely on a “common sense” idea so intuitive as to seem like a truism: the amount you have available to spend is strictly constrained by the amount you pay. Why am I ruining your morning with overworked Tory metaphors? Because inflation hit 9% yesterday, and the accompanying cost of living crisis will most painfully impact the poorest. Almost every one of today’s front pages covers the situation. Today’s newsletter is about some of the ways to reduce the pain – and the heretical suggestion that a truism might not actually be true. That mindblowing idea, and several others, are right after the headlines. Conservatives | Tory party officials came under increasing pressure to remove the whip from an MP arrested over claims of rape and sexual assault, as it emerged one alleged offence is connected to someone under 18. Cost of living | Police officers should use their “discretion” when deciding whether to prosecute people who steal in order to eat, the new chief inspector of constabulary told the Guardian. Ukraine | The UN warned that the war in Ukraine has helped to stoke a global food crisis that could last years if it goes unchecked, as the World Bank announced an additional $12bn in funding to mitigate its “devastating effects”. Deportation | A Home Office deportation flight to Jamaica took off with seven people on board. The government reportedly had a list of 100 people it hoped to remove on the flight. Health | More than 42 million adults in the UK will be overweight or obese by 2040 and at higher risk of cancer, an “alarming” new report reveals. Some 71% of people are expected to be overweight by 2040, against 64% today. For a sense of the government’s approach to the cost of living crisis, consider the two measures that the Treasury took out for a test drive in briefings yesterday: a “warm home discount” on energy bills in England and Wales, and a 1p cut to the basic income tax rate, brought forward from next year. The former would benefit the poorest 3m, and will cost about £1bn. The latter will be spread out across everybody, including those who have barely noticed the spike in their bills – and is worth five times as much. Meanwhile, many Conservatives are blaming the Bank of England for not raising interest rates early enough to keep inflation under control – but as the bank’s governor Andrew Bailey said on Monday, “we can’t predict things like wars – that’s not in anybody’s power.” Randeep Ramesh, the Guardian’s chief leader writer, says that it’s time to think bigger, and quotes John Maynard Keynes’ view that trying to beat a recession with monetary policy – the measures available to a central bank to control the supply of money – is like “pushing a piece of string”. Instead, he argues, we need to let go of the idea that big fiscal interventions – spending more money – are irresponsible. “There have long been injunctions that you can’t run big deficits or you go bankrupt,” he said. “Throughout coronavirus, central banks showed that there didn’t have to be this artificial limit to spending. But these ideologies take a long time to disappear.” So how did we get here? The status quo That pervasive idea that the country’s finances are analogous to a household budget – you have to balance the books – was popularised by Margaret Thatcher, and reinforced by David Cameron’s government during the austerity years. “In the mid-80s, the left didn’t accept that,” Randeep said. “But it was dragged to that position. The Tories cemented the analogy in people’s minds.” The reality of using monetary policy as your primary weapon against inflation and a cost of living crisis is that you wind up arguing, as Andrew Bailey has, that people should not ask for pay rises even as their expenses rocket. In the end, even when they succeed in keeping inflation down, those policies “shift disposable income from poorer families to richer ones, and they help people who invest in the pound – which is basically the city,” Randeep said. When the government does consider big interventions, it much prefers tax cuts to new spending. Rishi Sunak’s speech yesterday promising to cut taxes for business makes the front of the Daily Mail, while cabinet ministers Liz Truss and Alister Jack are on the front page of the Daily Telegraph with calls for more of the same. The alternative Another view of the way the economy works accepts that there are hard limits on our spending in the shape of finite resources and responsible stewardship of the planet – but adds that “when we say we’ve ‘spent all the money’ – the truth is there is no finite amount of money we can spend,” Randeep said. “Otherwise we wouldn’t have gone through £400bn during the pandemic without breaking a sweat.” This is a crisis “created by a spike in the price of fuel, by coronavirus, by supply chain disruption,” he added. “If that’s what’s causing inflation, the Bank of England isn’t going to tame it. You have to deal with those issues differently.” One measure popular with those who are sympathetic to this view – laid out by economist Torsten Bell in First Edition last week – is to bring forward an increase in benefits slated for next year. Other ideas might include a freeze in student loan repayments, greater subsidy for public transport or home insulation, and rent control. If these ideas sound revolutionary, Randeep points out versions in place in Austria, Italy, and France. In the US, Joe Biden paused federal student loan repayments, subsidised healthcare, and sent $1,400 in Covid relief to more than 100 million people. Despite those examples, in the UK, such policies remain beyond the pale. So why aren’t we talking about it? When Labour’s shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves was asked what she would do to deal with the effects of inflation on the Today programme yesterday, she talked about tax cuts and repeated Labour’s policy of a windfall tax on North Sea oil revenues – a crowdpleasing measure that had Boris Johnson on the back foot at yesterday’s Prime Minister’s Questions, but one which fundamentally accepts the narrative of balancing the books. The £2bn or more Labour estimates it would raise is a relatively small sum, but No 10 is still reported in The Times to view it as “ideologically unconservative”. The problem for Labour is that it has made a commitment that new day-to-day spending will be covered by taxation. “They are hamstrung because they don’t have an answer to the question ‘Where do you get the money from?’,” Randeep said. “Let’s be honest – the economy is worth two trillion. These sums are a rounding error.” It’s not like the Tories won’t bend the rules when it suits them. As today’s Guardian editorial says: “If the Conservatives can argue that taxes must come down to deal with inflation, even at the cost of a higher deficit, then surely Labour can argue that public spending could be increased for the same reason.” Nonetheless, the right’s framing of the issue has become so pervasive as to be unnoticeable, the air that we breathe. To overcome that, Randeep argues, you need to talk about “[wanting to] make sure everyone has a home, can eat properly, has a good standard of living. You need to fight on different political terrain.” That may still sound like a radical idea. “I don’t think it’s radical,” said Randeep. “What is radical is this unwillingness to see beyond our self-imposed limits. We’ve become an outpost for an ideology that has run its course. Through our strange political theatre, we have kept it alive.” Even the coldest heart (mine) was melted by Eurovision on Saturday - and second place for Sam Ryder was a pretty fun subplot to Ukraine’s victory.

Before this seismic agreement the winnings were deeply uneven: for the men’s World Cup in Qatar later this year, the prize money stood at $400m, but for women’s cup in 2023 it was only $60m.

5/19/2022,"Here is everything you need to know about the voting process in the 2022 Australia election. The 2022 Australian federal election day is Saturday, 21 May. The Australian Electoral Commission, the independent body that runs elections, says there are 17 million people enrolled to vote in the 2022 federal election – 96.3% of the eligible voting population. The deadline for enrolment was Monday 18 April. If you are not sure of the status of your enrolment, you can check here. You can also call the AEC on 13 23 26. You can find your electorate by entering your address on this page on the AEC website. The results of the 2019 election in each electorate are on the commission’s Tally Room site, but bear in mind that boundaries of some seats in Victoria and Western Australia have changed since then. You can read about what those changes mean on the election blog of the ABC’s Antony Green. If you are unable to cast a ballot in person at a polling station on election day, there are several other ways to vote. At this election extra provision has been made to ensure those affected by the recent floods in Queensland and NSW, and people affected by Covid, are not disenfranchised. If you can’t make it on the day, you can vote in advance at a pre-polling station. A list of these will be published on the AEC website. Mobile polling facilities are also set up in some hospitals, nursing homes, prisons and remote areas in advance of polling day, although at this election that service will be limited by Covid considerations (see below). You can apply via the AEC website to have your ballot papers sent to you in the mail. These must be completed by close of polling on election day and returned to the AEC, which allows 13 days after that for the ballots to arrive. In some countries you may be able to access an overseas voting centre – a list will be posted on the AEC website. Otherwise you need to apply for a postal vote, allowing enough time for the papers to be mailed to you. The AEC has expanded the provision of voting by phone (traditionally used for blind or low-vision Australians) to accommodate people who may be required to isolate because they have Covid or they are a close contact of someone who does. However, it has warned the process may not be entirely flawless. People who expect to be in isolation on polling day may apply for a postal vote. Those who test positive or who are close contacts of someone who tests positive between Wednesday and Saturday should contact the AEC to arrange a vote by phone. Close contacts who return a negative rapid test should check with their state or territory whether they are entitled to leave isolation to vote in person. At the ballot box, you will be handed two pieces of paper. The smaller is for the House of Representatives, which is elected using preferential voting. You must number every box in order of your preference for your vote to be valid. The larger is for the Senate, which consists of 76 members, 12 for each state, and two for each territory. On the Senate ballot paper, you can vote in one of two ways. First, you can number at least six boxes above the line, indicating the parties or groups you prefer in the order of your choice. Or you can vote below the line, meaning you are voting individually for the candidates nominated by each party or group. In this case you must number at least 12 boxes to cast a valid vote. There are 151 members of the House of Representatives, so one party needs to win at least 76 seats to form a majority government. Going into the election, the Liberal-National Coalition holds 76 seats, Labor holds 69 and the six others are held by minor parties and independents. To reach 76, Labor would need to retain their current number of seats and gain another seven. However, picking up an extra four seats from Liberal or Nationals would be enough for them to overtake the Coalition. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It may well be tight. According to analysis by Green: “Labor needs a uniform swing of 3.1% to gain four seats and 3.3% to gain seven. Yet Labor is defending 13 seats on a margin of up to 3%.” If the Coalition loses even one seat, but Labor fails to gain seven, Australia would have a hung parliament. In that case one or other of the major parties would have to secure the support of enough minor party or independent MPs to form government. A new wave of independents is running in Coalition-held seats at this election, which may increase the chances of a hung parliament.",News/Australia news,"Australian election 2022 voters’ guide: everything you need to know, including how to vote if you have Covid",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/19/australian-election-2022-voters-guide-how-to-vote-when-who-how-do-i-vote-if-i-have-covid-everything-you-need-to-know-australia-federal-poll-day
5/19/2022,"On 13 May, the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified of two confirmed cases and one probable case of monkeypox in the UK. The number of cases has now risen to nine. This has raised some alarm, because historically only eight cases have been detected in the UK, the first of those in 2018. Cases have also been detected in Spain (more than 20 cases) and Portugal in recent days, resulting in the largest monkeypox outbreak in Europe to date. So should Australia be worried? According to Peter Collignon, professor of infectious disease with the Australian National University, there is no cause for alarm in Australia. Even if a case were to be identified, “it’s not highly transmissible from person to person” he said. Animals are the reservoir for the virus, with rodents believed to be the main source. It seems it is mostly spread to humans through interaction with infected animals. Risk factors associated with human-to-human transmission include sleeping in the same room or bed, living in the same household, or drinking or eating from the same dish as an infected person. “People need to remember we actually have other pox viruses in Australia already, such as Orf, a highly contagious virus among sheep that occasionally spreads to humans, mostly the farmers who work with them,” Collignon said. “But we don’t see significant outbreaks of that in humans who become infected. Pox viruses are not new. And monkeypox is not like Covid, with a high transmission rate.” The first case of monkeypox anywhere was recorded in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in central Africa, during intense efforts to find and eliminate smallpox. The cases in the UK are unusual because monkeypox is an extremely rare virus outside parts of Africa, and does not spread easily between people. Since the recent UK cases were identified, 23 suspected cases have been identified in Spain, and five in Portugal, where at least 20 further cases are suspected. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning When the virus appears outside Africa, it is because someone travelled to an endemic region, became infected, and returned home. But in the UK, no source of infection has been confirmed for eight of the cases, despite contact-tracing efforts. The first of the recent cases found in the UK, detected on 7 May, had recently travelled to Nigeria where they are believed to have contracted the illness. But two other clusters of cases have emerged in the UK since, with no link established with that first case. “Based on currently available information, infection seems to have been locally acquired in the United Kingdom,” the WHO said in a statement issued on Thursday. “The extent of local transmission is unclear at this stage and there is the possibility of identification of further cases.” The virus leads to flu-like symptoms including fever, body aches and chills, and causes a distinctive rash in the form of lesions that often start on the face. There are two strains of monkeypox; a Central African strain with a fatality rate of 10.6%, and a West African strain with a much lower mortality rate of between 1-to-3.6%. The latter is the strain identified in the UK. But there have been warnings that countries outside Africa have become too complacent about the virus due to its rarity. A study published in the journal PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases in February found monkeypox cases, though rare, are rising. The study authors reviewed monkeypox data from many countries and studies, and found “an escalation of monkeypox cases, especially in the highly endemic DRC, a spread to other countries, and a growing median age from young children to young adults”. “These findings may be related to the cessation of smallpox vaccination, which provided some cross-protection against monkeypox, leading to increased human-to-human transmission,” the study found. “The appearance of outbreaks beyond Africa highlights the global relevance of the disease.” The authors urged for increased worldwide surveillance and detection of monkeypox cases to understand its changing epidemiology, and described it as a “resurging disease”. One of the clusters in the UK has been among men who have sex with men, but experts have warned against labelling it a sexually transmitted disease. Dr Michael Skinner, with the Imperial College London, said, “Although this is the first time we have seen monkeypox in this group, that may just be because previously the numbers of cases have been low and so specific groups are less likely to have been captured in the statistics.” “By nature, sexual activity involves intimate contact, which one would expect to increase the likelihood of transmission, whatever a person’s sexual orientation and irrespective of the mode of transmission,” he said.",News/Australia news,Monkeypox: what are the symptoms and should Australia be worried?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/19/monkeypox-virus-what-are-the-symptoms-should-australia-be-worried-virus-disease-outbreak-2022
