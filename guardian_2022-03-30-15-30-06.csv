3/30/2022,"The long anticipated third season of Atlanta begins with a lesson on whiteness. In the premiere, Three Slaps, a white man tells his Black companion that the remnants of an all-Black city, flooded by the government, lies beneath the lake where they are fishing so late at night. Barely a glimmer of skepticism crosses the Black man’s face; such horror falls quite believably within the realm of possibility (this lake is almost certainly based on Lake Lanier in Georgia, to say nothing of countless other razed Black enclaves across the country). “The thing about being white is it blinds you,” the white man muses, before he turns to the camera with his eyes sealed shut. Atlanta boasts some of the most sophisticated storytelling in recent years, a genre-defying venture to trace the intricacies of its particularly compelling characters and inevitably Black life. The show’s individuality coalesces under the sleek vision of its heavyweight creative team: namely, creator and star Donald Glover, his screenwriter brother Stephen Glover, director Hiro Murai and executive producer Stefani Robinson (also behind FX’s What We Do in the Shadows). The series so successfully evaded the “sophomore slump” that its lengthy hiatus – initially to accommodate the meteoric rise of its cast (a superhero film for Brian Tyree Henry, two for Zazie Beetz, and an Oscar nomination for LaKeith Stanfield) – was met, understandably, with a widespread groan. The premiere marks a triumphant, if somewhat unusual return: the principal characters – Al, the rapper better known as Paper Boi (Henry), his manager-cousin Earn (Glover), Al’s best friend Darius (Stanfield), and Earn’s ex-girlfriend Van (Beetz), with whom he shares a toddler – are largely absent. But the episode remains true to the show’s fundamental architecture: a series of oneiric forays into the surreal. Whiteness as blindness has the ring of a certain Du Boisian concept, which, put crudely, argues that if Black people are preternaturally perceptive – necessarily so, for survival reasons – then white people are woefully, dangerously myopic. But this is only the prologue (admittedly a better horror film than the bulk on offer of late). The episode centrally pivots around middle-schooler Loquareeous (Christopher Farrar). In a mischievous outburst, he jumps up on his desk and starts dancing in class. His mother and grandfather are summoned by school administrators, and their abrasive response – including the grandfather’s eponymous three slaps – alarms the white guidance counselor, a villain merely blind to her own noxious condescension. She interrupts the Black female principal, suggests that Loquareeous be placed in remedial classes, and finally, the tragic coup de gras: makes good on her promise to have the child removed from his home. Social services place Loquareeous with a hippie white lesbian couple, Amber (Laura Dreyfuss) and Gayle (Jamie Neumann), who already have three Black foster kids and immediately rename him “Larry”. They torment the children, feeding them raw chicken and avocado – when they feed them at all – and forcing them to sing field songs while they toil in the garden. It might strike as some kind of hyperbolic modern fable were it not so squarely based on blood-chilling true events, here given an antidotal rewrite, right before Earn, lying in bed, sleepily opens his eyes, seemingly to establish all that preceded a dream. The shot becomes rather illustrative of what yokes this episode to the second Sinterklaas is Coming to Town (if not the implicit project of the series altogether): reframing the world through the weary lens of its Black characters recasts – on those occasions they must directly confront it – “white culture” as exotic and frequently grotesque. In the episode, we finally reunite with the foursome in Amsterdam where Al is preparing for a concert; only it’s December, the season of Sinterklaas and his helper Zwarte Piet, popularly depicted in blackface. The tradition emerges in tension with the otherwise friendly and polite interactions Earn and Al in particular have with Dutch people. Meanwhile, Van and a very high Darius end up on an excursion to a mysterious residence where they witness the presumably assisted death of a Black man, whom Darius speculates may actually be Tupac. In a sea of tranquil, largely white mourners, Van and Darius exchange horrified glances as they man suffocates. Later, Al refuses to perform to a concert full of Dutch people in blackface, much to the unhinged ire of the white event organizer. It does give rise to one of the episode’s best lines as delivered by Henry: “Turn the clogs around, bruh. We ain’t doing this shit.” (Closely tied with, at least nominally, his late night text to Earn: “I need 300 pieces of fried chicken. All legs.”) Sinterklaas will naturally garner comparisons to last season’s Helen where Van dragged a reluctant Earn to predominantly white Fasnacht celebrations. But we have been primed for a consideration on the politics of looking. Indeed, the origin of Loquareeous’s troubles was the instinctive understanding that he might in some way be rewarded for turning himself into a racialized spectacle; harmless or not, it certainly underpins what his mother and grandfather fear so gravely. In that way, these episodes also gesture back to the much-discussed Teddy Perkins, where Darius happens upon the ghoulish Michael Jackson-esque figure wrought by devastating child abuse and alienating fame. It seems from Atlanta, the encounter with whiteness can be at best an absurd and eerie daydream, and at worst a nightmare.",Arts/Television & radio,Atlanta is back and taking bigger swings than ever before,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/30/atlanta-season-three-donald-glover
3/30/2022,"A former Australian soldier has objected on the grounds of self-incrimination to answer questions about whether he shot a prisoner on the orders of his patrol commander, Ben Roberts-Smith, in Afghanistan in 2012. Federal court judge Anthony Besanko on Wednesday ruled he would not compel the former SAS soldier, anonymised before the court as Person 66, to answer questions about a mission in the village of Syahchow in October 2012. “I am not satisfied that the interest of justice require that Person 66 give the evidence,” Besanko said. Person 66 was subpoenaed to give evidence in court by three newspapers defending a defamation action brought by Roberts-Smith, his former comrade and Victoria Cross recipient. Roberts-Smith alleges the newspapers’ reports portrayed him as committing war crimes, including murder, as well as acts of bullying. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. The court heard that it was alleged Person 66, a former member of Australia’s SAS, had undertaken a single operation under Roberts-Smith’s command to the village of Syahchow, in Uruzgan province, in October 2012. The newspapers allege in their defence that on the mission Person 66 was “blooded” on the orders of Roberts-Smith after they removed two unarmed prisoners from a compound where the men had been detained and took them to a nearby field. The defence alleges Roberts-Smith ordered Person 66 to shoot one of the men, and claim that he complied with the order. The practice of “blooding” new soldiers – essentially an experienced senior soldier ordering a new subordinate to kill an unarmed person – occurred among Australian SAS soldiers in Afghanistan, the newspapers allege. “‘Blooding’ refers to initiating a person in the practice of killing, or giving them the taste for killing,” the newspapers’ defence states. Person 66 began giving evidence briefly on Monday and told the court he was temporarily attached to the SAS patrol commanded by Roberts-Smith. But when asked how many missions he’d undertaken under the command of Roberts-Smith, Person 66 objected to answering on the grounds of self-incrimination. Barrister Jack Tracey, representing Person 66, told the court that the evidence the former soldier was expected to give could tend to incriminate him in an alleged murder. Besanko said there were reasonable grounds for Person 66’s objection, and told the witness that the court would grant him a certificate under section 128 of the Evidence Act preventing his evidence being used against him in Australian courts. But Person 66 still objected to giving the evidence – notwithstanding the certificate – requiring the court to consider whether it should require him to do so. On Wednesday, Besanko ruled Person 66 would not be compelled to answer questions on the Syahchow mission, ruling it did not serve the interests of justice. Following Besanko’s ruling, Nick Owens SC, acting for the newspapers, put the questions directly to Person 66 on Wednesday afternoon. “On a mission in October 2012 when you were a member of Mr Roberts-Smith’s patrol, did you shoot a Puc [person under control]?” the barrister asked. “I object your honour,” Person 66 said. Asked by the judge whether he was willing to give the evidence under the protection of a certificate, Person 66 told the judge: “I am not willing.” Owens then asked: “On a mission in October 2012 when you were a member of Mr Roberts-Smith’s patrol, did Mr Roberts-Smith order you to shoot a Puc.” “I object to answer that your honour,” Person 66 said. Roberts-Smith has denied the Syahchow allegation. Asked directly during his evidence last year if he had ordered Person 66 to execute a prisoner, Roberts-Smith said: “I did not.” He told the court that during the mission the bodies of two insurgents were found in a wooded area after a skirmish outside a compound which ended when an Australian soldier threw a grenade into the area where the insurgents were. “We threw the grenade to ascertain whether or not the insurgents were dead,” Roberts-Smith told the court during his evidence. “We got no response after the grenade went in, and then cleared into the trees or into the vegetation, and there were two insurgents that had been engaged.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Roberts-Smith’s barrister, Bruce McClintock SC, told the court in 2021 that “the incident in question never happened”. “The respondents [the newspapers] have proffered no detail of the supposed crime, such as the identity of the victim, the time during the mission when it took place other than – or the place other than – a nearby field; nor, for that matter, is any motive identified,” McClintock said. Person 66 is the second former SAS soldier who has objected on the grounds of self-incrimination to giving evidence about an alleged blooding incident. A soldier known as Person 4 also refused to answer questions about an operation at a compound called Whiskey 108, in the village of Kakarak, in 2009. The trial resumes on Thursday morning and is expected to run for several more weeks.",News/Australia news,Witness at defamation trial refuses to answer questions about whether Ben Roberts-Smith ordered him to shoot Afghan prisoner,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/30/witness-at-defamation-trial-refuses-to-answer-questions-about-whether-ben-roberts-smith-ordered-him-to-shoot-afghan-prisoner

3/30/2022,"With the return to the office in full swing and fuel prices rocketing, smart thermostats offer one relatively easy way to help reduce your energy use without big changes to your central heating system. These are direct replacements for traditional timers and thermostats that give your boiler a hi-tech upgrade without cancelling out any of its features. Most work with a large range of gas, LPG, oil or electric boilers, including those with hot water tanks, and many will work with biomass or heat pumps, too. The majority consist of a control unit that is wired to your boiler and a wired or wireless thermostat that you place in the centre of your home. Many also require a hub that is wired into your router for online or phone-based functions. Smart thermostats come in all shapes, sizes, prices and capabilities from a range of different manufacturers. While features vary depending on the model and manufacturer, most give you more control over your heating, hot water and boiler than comes with a standard system. You can adjust their temperature setting, set timings and turn the heating on and off via an app on your phone or using Amazon’s Alexa or Google’s Assistant smart speakers. It is a lot easier to create a detailed schedule of when you want the heating to go on and off in an app than it is on the pokey display of a traditional timer but most smart models will also allow you to adjust their schedules directly on the thermostat’s screen. Some, such as Google’s Nest thermostats, can learn your habits and automatically adjust your heating schedule to save energy when you don’t need it. Many learn how fast your home heats up, too, so they can turn on at the right moment to hit a certain temperature at a set time. The best models also take into account the outside temperature and the impact of the sun on your building, so you don’t end up paying to heat your home when you don’t need to. One of the best features of a smart thermostat is the ability to automatically turn off the heating if you are not home. Most can use your phone to track where you are, if you opt in, and can turn the heating off automatically or send you a prompt to do so when you leave home and back on when you return. Some also offer presence-sensing directly on the thermostat – it will detect if anyone walks past it, which helps to avoid the heating turning off if someone is still home even if you are not. Others can be linked to smart door and window sensors, so the heating is turned off if a window is open or you have exited through a door. Another useful feature is the ability to see a history of your heating use during the day, week or month, and to view it in charts comparing your use with the outside temperature. Some allow you to tell it your energy tariff, which allows it to show roughly how much money you have used on heating to help budgeting. However, some manufacturers, such as Hive, charge a monthly or yearly subscription for access to view your data. Some of the smart thermostats can be linked up with smart thermostatic radiator valves to let you control the temperature of individual rooms. They turn each radiator up and down as required and can fire up the boiler when needed. They promise to increase comfort but also energy efficiency by heating only the rooms that need it. But these smart TRVs are not cheap at £40-60 each and need to be fitted to every radiator, meaning the costs quickly add up. There are lots of smart thermostats to choose from, and most cost between £100 and £200 without professional installation. Hive’s latest Thermostat Mini is one of the cheapest, at £119, including the hub that connects to your router. Installation by Hive costs £100. Google’s DIY Nest Thermostat E costs £199 or less from third-party retailers for only heating, or the main Nest thermostat for hot water tank control, too, costs £219. Installation costs under £100. Tado’s wireless Smart Thermostat V3 costs £200, with installation costing under £100. Make sure to check the compatibility with your central heating system on the thermostat manufacturer’s site if buying for DIY installation. Most models can be bought direct from the manufacturer, from online retailers such as Amazon or through DIY shops such as Screwfix and Toolstation. But for people requiring installation, too, many small local and large national heating firms offer the service. In theory, yes. Google’s Nest estimates that UK customers can save between 8.4 and 16.5% of their heating’s energy use, Tado estimates up to 31%, while Hive says up to £110 worth at pre-crisis prices. However, in practice it depends on what it replaces, how you use it and how much energy you currently use. Being able to automatically pause a heating schedule when you leave your home can save considerable amounts of energy if your schedule is unpredictable. Systems that identify when you can turn down the heat and save money without affecting comfort too much can also help. Simply being aware of the current temperature and heating history can help you save the most money, as turning down the thermostat is still the most effective way of reducing fuel use without modifying your home.",Lifestyle/Money,How smart thermostats can save you fuel and money,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/30/how-smart-thermostats-can-save-you-fuel-and-money
3/30/2022,"Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it’s Ivanka Trump swooping in to save Ukraine. Nato may not be giving Volodymyr Zelenskiy the no-fly zone he wants, but he can at least take solace in the fact that he has the full force of Saint Ivanka by his side. If you haven’t heard about the former first daughter’s latest selfless humanitarian exertions, it’s not because she has been modest about them. Ivanka has kept a low profile since her father lost the 2020 election, but has recently stepped back into the spotlight to ensure her good deeds don’t go unnoticed. On Friday, Ivanka updated her Instagram account for the first time since January with a post trumpeting the fact that she has helped deliver more than a million meals to Ukrainian refugees in Poland. Fox News also published a long puff piece full of adoring quotes from anonymous sources and a Florida pastor she is working with about how a plane full of food destined for refugees would never have got off the ground “if it weren’t for [Ivanka’s] immediate involvement”. Don’t get me wrong, helping refugees should always be applauded. Hurrah Ivanka! But it’s easy to be cynical about a Trump’s charity; quid pro quo seems to be the family motto. Donald Trump withheld congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine in 2019, 90 minutes after a phone call with Zelenskiy in which Trump seems to have pressured him for a favour – the subject of Trump’s first impeachment. Weirdly, I don’t recall Ivanka being quite so concerned about the Ukrainian people back then. She was, after all, busy palling around with oligarchs in Vladmir Putin’s inner circle, such as Roman Abramovich. People change, of course. I’ll be the first to admit that Ivanka is a very different person now to how she was when Dad was in power. She’s in the middle of fighting a fraud case for one thing and, very embarrassingly and inconveniently, Trump can’t prevent himself from calling Putin “smart”.

3/30/2022,"In December, my neighbour was notified by HM Revenue and Customs that she was entitled to a rebate of £324 for the tax year 2020/2021, and that a cheque was being sent to a firm called Calculate My PPI, a claims company she used several years ago. Calculate My PPI denies receiving the cheque and HMRC is saying that it can’t, or won’t, do anything to help. She can’t even ascertain whether the cheque has been cashed or not. She had initially approached the claims firm to see if she was entitled to compensation for mis-sold PPI, since she struggles to use a computer. It now appears the company has, unbeknownst to her, retained a control over her tax affairs. There must be many others who have used third-party PPI claims firms, potentially in the same boat.CHY, Bristol In January, I warned about online firms that offer to reclaim overpaid tax on behalf of customers for an enormous fee, and trap them in an ongoing contract. Some customers who made a PPI claim through a third party have found their signature and national insurance number transposed on to a deed, so that a company can cash in on any pending tax refunds. It seems unlikely this happened in your neighbour’s case since the deadline for applying for PPI compensation was August 2019, a year before Calculate My PPI (CMPPI) was set up by a 34-year-old, self-described teacher in Slough. Its website declares that those who have made a successful claim for mis-sold PPI in the last four years could be due rebates worth thousands from HMRC. This is potentially true, because many claimants were not liable for the tax automatically deducted from compensation payments, and are therefore entitled to reclaim it. The company uses a news cutting featuring MoneySavingExpert.com founder, Martin Lewis, urging readers to claim their PPI tax rebate before the deadline. The cutting is cropped to remove the fact that such rebates can be claimed for free. Claimants who study CMPPI’s small print will notice it deducts 35% of any payout plus VAT for the service. It would seem your neighbour filled out the company’s claim form which, at the point of signature, displays, in minute print, a page of terms and conditions. This is, in fact, a deed of assignment to HMRC, and by signing it the customer authorises CMPPI to act on their behalf on a “continuing basis”. That includes having it named as their agent on their HMRC account, and receiving any tax repayments due. CMPPI then, in theory, deducts its hefty fee and remits the rest to the customer. It’s possible that your neighbour’s rebate was due to the exertions of this firm. However, two months after the cheque should have reached CMPPI, she was still empty-handed. HMRC refused to confirm to me, or to your neighbour, whether the cheque had been cashed, citing “strict rules on confidentiality”. However, it did agree to phone your neighbour and promised a resolution. Within the week Calculate My PPI had sent her the full rebate via two postal orders. The government has announced a consultation on the high cost of claiming tax refunds, including the fees charged by claims firms, but has declined to disclose a date. Nor would it comment on whether the number of claims made by third-party agents was increasing. As it stands, once an agent is appointed to act on behalf of a customer, they are legally entitled to any tax rebate, and the customer can only get them removed from HMRC records if the firm sends a contract waiver. This means there’s no escape for those in the clutches of unscrupulous operators for, according to HMRC, anyone who was signed up to an agent without their knowledge must take it up with the company. It says: “We take firm action against any agents who are not complying with the law. We encourage customers to come to HMRC directly to make their claims. “The same information is needed whether you apply via an agent, or directly yourself. It only takes a few minutes to complete HMRC’s online application and you get to keep all of what you are due. “We urge anyone thinking of using a tax refund company to actively read the company’s terms and conditions on documents and websites, so they understand, in advance, the fees they will pay, the service they’re signing up for, and any legal contract they may be entering into.” Martin Lewis says: “I personally wouldn’t touch CMPPI with a bargepole – especially as it is using my name on its website without notifying me – and it knows I suggest people DIY these tax claims for free.” Calculate My PPI advertises a London number on its website and, reassuringly, encourages potential claimants to ring for advice and support. However, a voicemail declares that the company has closed its office in response to the pandemic and requests overtures by email.

3/30/2022,"There is a whoop of delight from our four-year-old, Jemima, as we slow down the car to let a flock of baby red-legged partridges, with their bold, black-striped flanks and chestnut tails, scuttle across our path. As an opening scene for our stay at The Farm at Avebury, this set the tone – our children taking great delight each day in trying to “say hello” to the darting partridges as they zigzagged through the grounds. This working farm is set within gently rolling green mounds at the foot of the mysterious Silbury Hill, and we have wellies at the ready during our short break here. They rear Hereford and Angus cattle, rugged sheep, and the newest residents: a litter of Oxford Sandy and Black piglets. We are staying in one of six newly converted stables. They are clustered around a landscaped courtyard with bronzed planters and borders crafted out of Dutch corten steel, enveloping colourful bursts of cosmos, verbena and “Purrsian Blue” catmint. Eight thousand bulbs planted in and among these planters will see a riot of snowdrops, muscari and anemones giving way to daffodils, fritillaria and alliums. This courtyard becomes the focus of endless hours of play, as Seb, eight, and Jemima whiz around at breakneck speed on bicycles and scooters (provided by the farm) as we watch from the safety of the picture window inside Long Barrow – our retreat for the next few days. There is a well-thought-out welcome pack, including sourdough bread, butter, milk, eggs and juice, all sourced locally. The interior is compact but cosy, with a vaulted ceiling; there are two bedrooms, both with en suites, and one is situated on an open mezzanine floor accessed via a built-in wooden ladder. Original artwork sits alongside contemporary pieces, and the colour scheme is muted and calming, with flourishes of blush pink. For those in need of extra provisions there is the option to order from the farm, or there are shops and pubs aplenty in nearby Avebury. Shortly after we settle in, the children are whisked off by Jamie King from the outdoor adventure company Mud and Guts. King, who bills himself as the pied piper of the natural surroundings in Wiltshire, gets children to explore the nooks and crannies of local forests, farms and mounds. That night the conversation during dinner is animated. King has led Seb and Jemima around the estate and they have been building dens, lighting fires, whittling wood and learning about the geology of the local, ancient stones. Weeks later we are still finding bits of flint in coat pockets and bedroom drawers. While the children are off embracing nature, we are treated to a yoga session with Maura Barber-Oosterhuis, who holds regular sessions in the barn – a beautiful, calming space available for hire, and for now our very own private sanctuary. As we stretch and bend and offer our salutations to the sun, our exhaustion at being full-time working parents begins to drift away. The Farm at Avebury, or Galteemore Farm as it has been known since the 1890s, has been worked by the same family, the Hues, since 1922. Its newest custodians are Rob and Alice, both 38. They are the fourth generation to take it on and have reimagined it for the future of their three daughters. Farming has undergone the biggest change in a generation, explains Rob, with the devastating impact of the pandemic, the removal of subsidies, the fallout from Brexit and the focus on climate crisis. Though the last is a positive and much-needed step, Rob says it has required farmers across the country to radically alter how they live and work in order to survive. Brexit means the UK has left the EU’s common agricultural policy, under which farmers received about £3.5bn a year in payments based on the amount of land they farmed. In future, there will be payments of “public money for public goods” – that is, farmers taking measures to restore nature, nurture the soil, improve air and water quality, and provide habitats for wildlife, in return for taxpayer-funded support under a system of Environmental Land Management schemes, or ELMs. “So we had to do something to protect ourselves for the future, and hopefully the income that we will lose from subsidies will be replaced by the income we will now get from the self-catering business. It’s the same for most farmers: if we want to carry on farming, we also have to do something else,” Rob says. And with a quarter of a million tourists passing through historic Avebury – with its Unesco World Heritage stone circle site – every year, combined with a shortfall of accommodation in the area, it feels like Rob is hitting the right notes. Wiltshire isn’t somewhere we had visited before, or even really considered (sincerest apologies to all “Moonrakers”), but it is the perfect getaway for a family with children, having so many fascinating sites in the vicinity to bring primary-school history lessons alive. There are visits to Stonehenge (a definite bucket list moment for me), but possibly the more interesting monument, and within walking distance of the farm, is the Avebury stone circle, a prehistoric wonder of epic proportions – and one where the children can actually pause, study and ask questions, without the tourist circus of its more famous cousin 30 minutes’ drive away. Time on the farm in between the sightseeing was restorative. With what seems like the entire UK family holidaying population crammed into every square metre of Devon and Cornwall, give the farm, Avebury and Wiltshire a look instead.

3/30/2022,"The year was 2000, and some regulars from Soho’s legendary lesbian venue Candy Bar were planning a trip to Lesbos, which they advertised with a flyer titled “wet pussy pool party”, which somehow got on to the desk of the island’s mayor. In translation to the Greek, it became a bit more formal – a Greek friend translated it back to English for me as “suppurating vagina swimming event” – and the mayor of Lesbos banned the lesbians from the island. It turned out he didn’t have the authority to do that, and they went anyway. This is why local government is harder than it looks. I went over to cover the event for London’s Evening Standard. Frankly, it would have been better to send a gay woman. I meant well, but I had only the very sketchiest notion of inclusive language, as in, I didn’t know whether I should call it a “lesbian bar” or just say “gay bar” and then indicate later that it was full of women. Anyway, I arrived in Lesbos a wreck. I’d gone to bed at 3am the night before a 6am flight; the photographer had to wake both my downstairs neighbours to get me up. I left my flat with only a passport and the clothes I’d fallen asleep in. I definitely didn’t have any swimwear, I don’t think I owned any. But, by lunchtime, there I was, on Lesbos, at the pool. It was idyllic. When I try to conjure the image, it’s like remembering a dream of a perfect holiday, or an advert. Baking sunshine, piña coladas, men beetling about everywhere trying to bring things, languid laughter erupting from different loungers, like a Mexican wave. Everyone knew I was a journalist, obviously, since we’d all been on the same flight, and there was an element of suspicion, as there would be, right? Would you, if news of your planned holiday had made it into the papers, leading the mayor of the town to try to ban you, want a random person standing about, next to a photographer, surveying the scene, waiting to craft your beano into a narrative for a newspaper that didn’t have a clue? Not really. It’s amazing, looking back, that I wasn’t more embarrassed. I thought I was Martha bloody Gellhorn. The problem with this kind of journalism is that it’s bullshit. Most people are not bigots. With Lesbos’s economy reliant on tourism, most people were really happy about the visitors, and would no more think of being rude or disrespectful to them than they would deliberately give them food poisoning. So I’m trying to “cover” a clash of cultures – rigidity meeting modernity, prejudice versus humanity, old hatreds facing down new love, yikyak yikyak – but that doesn’t really exist, except in the mind of the mayor; if I managed to find any conflict, it would have been by looking so hard that I basically created it. And that would be really ugly, and not at all funny. And while we’re here, are we absolutely sure that the mayor really said that? Because he’s unavailable for comment, so realistically, he can’t be that upset. Anyway, I pulled it together, interviewing waiters and naked deck chair vendors and such, filed the Evening Standard piece down the phone on day two and it came out on day three. The internet existed then, we also had phones, but nobody had any reliable means of reading a British paper. Thanks to the vagaries of the flights in and out, we were all there for the week. Someone called home to ask what the piece was like, and her friend said, “Oh, it was fine. There was something about you being ugly, but otherwise it just sounded like you were all having a great time.” All hell broke loose. “We’re ugly?” one woman shouted from the deep end, as I traversed the poolside without a care in the world. “Do you want to know what you look like?” “You’ve been wearing the same shirt for three days!”, someone else pointed out, not unjustly. There was some really loud speculation about whether or not I’d ever heard of sunscreen. It was true, I wasn’t looking my best. But the actual quote had been something like – it was a young waiter, with exquisite, rather purple English – “People say lesbians are ugly, but these are all beautiful women and it is an honour to serve them.” It was fine, I got the piece faxed to the hotel, everyone read it, agreed that neither I nor any Lesbos residents thought they were ugly. A question mark remained over why I couldn’t perform basic self-care, but after that, I was part of the group and ended up duetting Moon River at 2am with a woman I then tried to get off with as a gesture of goodwill, and she told me to sod off, but in a nice way. I didn’t learn anything about my sexuality, by the way. I learned something about work: that there is no such thing as a subject and an observer in journalism. Every interaction has two equal humans in it, and if, in your mad hubris, you’ve arrogated the power to tell the story, you have to use that power with complete humility, because otherwise you are an idiot.

3/30/2022,"Peak bodies representing doctors and nurses say the federal budget does little to address a health system fatigued from responding to Covid-19, and that a failure to provide enough money for workforce shortages in areas like aged care and disability will further exacerbate the strain. The budget, handed down on Tuesday night, allocated $4.2bn in 2022-23 for the ongoing pandemic response, including $1bn for further rollout of vaccines, and $2.6bn to replenish the stockpile of personal protective equipment and rapid antigen tests in high-risk settings. The budget papers predicted a fresh winter Omicron wave, with a combined spike in Covid and influenza infections expected to see increased rates of absenteeism and put pressure on supply chains. However, Royal Australian College of General Practitioners president, Dr Karen Price, said the budget will not do enough to address long-term issues. “General practice is under enormous pressure delivering Covid-19 vaccines and soon we will be doing the same for influenza vaccines,” Price said. “We are helping patients who have delayed or avoided care during the pandemic, including those with mental health issues amidst a looming mental health crisis in Australia. To give general practice a helping hand we need to fix workforce gaps, particularly in rural and remote areas, and increase Medicare rebates to reflect the cost of providing high-quality general practice care for all patients no matter their postcode.” Price is also concerned that key components of the Primary Health Care 10 Year Plan remain unfunded, including voluntary patient registration which would encourage patients with chronic health conditions in particular to enrol with a general practice and nominate a regular GP. In return, GP clinics would receive block funding to improve the health of specific patient cohorts, such as those with diabetes. The RACGP says voluntary patient registration would encourage continuity of care and provide greater support to patients with complex conditions. “The budget provides $0.5m over four years to establish and maintain a governance and advisory group for the implementation of the 10 Year Plan,” Price said. “But we’ve already had three years of discussions and roundtables. We don’t need more of the same, we need action.” Peak advisory body Catholic Health Australia (CHA), which represents not-for-profit Catholic aged care providers, said there was nothing substantial in the budget to address the workforce crisis in aged care. CHA chief executive, Pat Garcia, said the failure to increase workforce remuneration meant attracting new people to the understaffed and fatigued sector and retaining staff would be difficult, and would increase pressures on the health and aged care systems. The $49.5m allocated for aged care training places and clinical placements for nurses was not enough to address the extent of these workforce pressures, Garcia said. “Additional training places are all very well, but the sector is struggling to attract and retain aged care workers because they are simply not paid enough for the essential and demanding caring role they perform for the Australian community,” she said. “The government has previously announced that minimum staffing levels will be mandatory in residential aged care, but it is far from certain whether there will be the workforce available to meet these standards, let alone the additional workforce required for the significant increase in the number of home care packages and the needs of the ageing cohort.” The Australian Primary Health Care Nurses Association president, Karen Booth, also welcomed the inclusion of nursing placements in the budget but agreed the funding would not address an ageing nurse workforce, overwhelming workloads, and a lack of available nurses available to carry out preventive healthcare checks. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Booth added that thousands of nursing students were unable to graduate because they had been unable to secure the necessary clinical placement time in medical settings due to restrictions implemented during the pandemic. “Australia is already struggling to meet the demand for healthcare in settings such as residential aged care homes due to a desperately short supply of primary healthcare nurses,” Booth said. “The Morrison government’s decision to splash cash in a short-term sugar hit for aged care workers fails to address the issues that threaten Australia’s ability to meet the health needs of its citizens in years to come. “One in four primary healthcare nurses already tell us they are leaving their jobs in the next couple of years, meaning we will have even less ability to keep Australia healthy in future decades. “As a result, Australia is at risk of not having enough suitably trained primary healthcare nurses to staff aged care homes, general practices, and other primary healthcare settings in coming years.”",News/Australia news,"Budget does not do enough for Covid fatigued health system and aged care workforce crisis, peak bodies say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/30/budget-does-not-do-enough-for-covid-fatigued-health-system-and-aged-care-workforce-crisis-peak-bodies-say
3/30/2022,"Scott Morrison and the New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, have urged the high court to preserve their power to handpick candidates for the federal election. With just days before the expected start of the federal election campaign, the NSW Liberal party’s preselection saga has become a full-blown crisis, and is heading either to the high court or the NSW court of appeal for an urgent hearing. Morrison and Perrotet have asked a challenge against the preselection of sitting MPs Alex Hawke, Trent Zimmerman and Sussan Ley to be sent straight to the high court to prevent sore losers appealing a lower court decision closer to the May election. Ongoing factional warfare has left the Liberals without candidates in five potentially winnable federal seats in NSW, where the party had hoped to pick up seats. So how did we get here, what’s the latest, and what might happen next? The NSW Liberal party’s preselection crisis has been running for months and basically comes down to whether factional leaders should determine who is the candidate for parliament or the grassroots members of the party. The seeds of the turmoil go back to 2018 when the NSW division agreed to adopt new rules in its constitution, known as the Warringah rules, championed by the former prime minister Tony Abbott and the right wing of the party. They give branches the right to hold plebiscites involving all eligible branch members to choose local, state and federal candidates. The NSW Liberal party’s governing bodies, the NSW state executive and the state council, still get 25% of the votes, giving them a say. The right faction pushed hard for the more democratic process because it believes the members are more conservative than the governing bodies of the party, which are controlled by the moderates. The plebiscites certainly reduced the power of factional powerbrokers. Many of the nominations for seats closed in May last year, but the nominations committee, which vets prospective candidates, failed to meet. Hawke, the prime minister’s representative, who runs the centre-right faction and is the PM’s numbers man in the party, was not available for months. This meant plebiscites were not held. Time has been running out, and the election, which must be held by May, is looming. The factional leaders tried to carve up the remaining nine winnable seats among the factions. This required the NSW state executive to override the constitutional requirements for plebiscites with special powers. But it needed 90% support to achieve this, and despite several tries, there was always a few members, including the Sydney businessman Matthew Camenzuli, who wanted a democratic process. By late February, the NSW Liberal party was dancing on the edge of a cliff. The federal executive of the party, at the urging of Morrison and Hawke, considered intervention, but the body, made up of key officials and state presidents, was reluctant. It eventually agreed to step in and appoint the sitting members as the candidates, meaning their jobs were saved. It gave the NSW party a 25 March deadline to resolve preselections. The limited intervention was achieved by appointing a committee of three, including the prime minister and the former president, who took over the NSW branch for three days, but handed control back to the division. The NSW state executive then agreed to resolve a couple of seats such as Dobell, where only one candidate was left standing, and Bennelong, which had a preselection, and to proceed with plebiscites in Hughes, Parramatta and Eden Monaro where there was more than one nominee. The votes were due to be held this week. But last Sunday, the federal executive intervened again – this time for a week. In an application, seen on Wednesday by Guardian Australia, the Liberal applicants including Morrison and Perrottet have asked for the entire case to be removed from the NSW supreme court to the high court. They asked for the proceeding to be expedited, with a hearing to be listed on Thursday, to answer questions including whether courts have jurisdiction to hear intra-party disputes, which the applicants argued were “important points of law” that needed to be settled. The application notes that on 6 March the committee endorsed Hawke in Mitchell, Ley in Farrer and Zimmerman in North Sydney, but Camenzuli sought to challenge the preselections in the supreme court. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The validity of a large number of additional party preselections depends upon the outcome of the present dispute,” they said. The applicants noted the matter is listed before NSW court of appeal Justice John Basten on Thursday, but said the hearing is “unlikely to go ahead” due to constitutional issues in the case. The applicants warned if the high court doesn’t hear the case, the unsuccessful parties in any NSW court of appeal case would likely appeal to the high court anyway.

Camenzuli alleges that the committee, appointed by the federal party to run the affairs of the NSW party, and which included Morrison, Perrottet and the former party president Chris McDiven, acted beyond its powers. Robertson told Basten that as federal parliament could be dissolved by the weekend and an election called, the case needed to be resolved as a matter of urgency. Basten said the NSW court of appeal stood ready to hear the case on Thursday. This offer of a court of appeal hearing would remove one level of appeal and would involve three judges hearing the issue. Counsel for the federal Liberal party and Morrison, Guy Reynolds SC, indicated his client was seeking to have the case removed to the high court. He argued that hearing in the NSW court of appeal “would not achieve finality” because an appeal to the high court was available. But access to the high court is not automatic and would require an application and hearing for leave. Basten said he was not inclined for the supreme court of NSW to “wash its hands of the case”, but acknowledged that “the jurisprudential meat” in the case was large. He has now set it down for Friday, pending the outcome of the application in the High court.",News/Australia news,NSW Liberal preselection crisis: why Morrison and Perrottet want to rush case to high court,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/30/nsw-liberal-preselection-crisis-why-morrison-and-perrottet-want-to-rush-case-to-high-court
3/30/2022,"Good morning, Warren Murray here to help you get up to speed quickly. Boris Johnson has been left facing a renewed threat to his position over the partygate scandal as the police decision to fine 20 people is seen as clearcut confirmation of lawbreaking at the heart of government – shattering the prime minister’s claim that Covid rules were followed. Downing Street has provoked fury and derision by still refusing to accept that the fixed-penalty notices meant definitively that the rules had been broken. There is still a possibility Johnson will be among those fined – the Met has made clear these were only the first tickets and interviews with key figures are likely in the coming weeks. Rebel Tory MPs have said they will renew efforts to convince colleagues that the prime minister lied to parliament. Johnson attempted to shore up his leadership on Tuesday night with a dinner for Tory MPs, but a number declined to attend, and those who did were heckled by bereaved families of Covid victims as they arrived. Shouts of “shame on you” and “off to another party are we?” were directed at Michael Gove and Jacob Rees-Mogg as they turned up to the Park Plaza near Westminster Bridge. Senior Tory MPs such as the former attorney general Jeremy Wright have said it should mean resignation or removal from office if Johnson is found to have knowingly attended rule-breaking parties. Some MPs are reserving their judgment until the full report on the parties by senior civil servant Sue Gray is released, which will not happen until the police investigation is over. Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, renewed calls for Johnson to resign: “The buck stops with the prime minister, who spent months lying to the British public, which is why he has got to go.” ‘Not naive people’ – Volodymyr Zelenskiy has dismissed Russia’s pledge to cut back its invasion effort, saying “Ukrainians are not naive people” and vowing to continue defensive military efforts. “Ukrainians have already learned during these 34 days of invasion and over the past eight years of the war in Donbas that only a concrete result can be trusted.” Russia’s deputy defence minister, Alexander Fomin, said after talks in Istanbul on Tuesday that Moscow wanted to “increase mutual trust” to help secure a peace deal, and therefore it would “radically reduce military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv”. Ukraine’s armed forces responded that the Russian withdrawals were merely “a rotation of individual units” and the Kremlin claims were intended to “mislead the military leadership” of Ukraine. Zelenskiy said the “positive” signals “do not drown out the explosions of Russian shells … Mariupol is blocked. Missile and airstrikes do not stop. This is the reality. These are the facts.” Keep up with developments at our live blog.

Disposable income squeeze – The UK’s poorest families will see spare cash at their disposal drop by a fifth or £850 this year, according to figures from market analysts Kantar. Grocery price inflation reached 5.2% in March, the highest level since April 2012. Price rises are being fuelled by the rising cost of labour and basic commodities such as wheat and cooking oil – as well as the cost of energy and packaging driven by a combination of Brexit, resurgence in demand post-lockdown and the war in Ukraine. Rising energy bills, food prices and transport costs are set to plunge many into the red with 13% of households saying they are only just about managing to cover minimum payments on credit card bills and a further 6% already unable to, according to other analysis. No authority at all – It turns out that Jackie Weaver really did have “no authority here, no authority at all” to remove parish councillors from a chaotic online meeting during lockdown. Video from the Handforth council Zoom meeting of December 2020 was shared by millions across the world. An independent investigation found participants’ complaints were correct: the muting of microphones and removal of individual councillors “was without authority”, though Weaver was only trying to do her best. Weaver, employed by the Cheshire Association of Local Councils, had been brought in to help run the meeting amid accusations of poor councillor behaviour. The fallout from the meeting has included six independent investigation reports and costs of more than £85,000. Reacting to the findings, Weaver told the BBC that she felt the jury was still out on precise meeting procedure: “I welcome the findings of the report but am deeply saddened that it took so long and cost so much to get there.” Ramzan Kadyrov, the feared Chechen leader and staunch Putin ally, has claimed to be in Ukraine commanding a unit alongside Russian forces.

The prospect of Tiger Woods making an incredible comeback at the Masters next week has increased after the 15-time major winner arrived on Tuesday at Augusta National for a practice round. Nick Kyrgios once again lost his cool as he succumbed to defeat in an extraordinary match at the Miami Open, during which he abused the umpire, posed for a selfie and was docked a game. Plans to allow teams to qualify for the Champions League based on historical performance have received the backing of Europe’s top clubs as the best way to ensure the competition remains “premium” and “inclusive”.

The Guardian’s lead story today is “Law-breaking in No 10: police issue first 20 Partygate fines”. The front-page picture is Prince Andrew alongside the Queen at a thanksgiving service for the Duke of Edinburgh. There’s much discussion of Andrew being front and centre with his mother. “Royals’ ‘dismay’ at Andrew role in Philip service” says the Daily Mail. The Queen was photographed looking teary-eyed during the service for her late husband, and the Mirror turns that into “The pain … & the stain”, the latter a clear reference to the hovering Duke of York. A more measured take in the Sun which calls Her Majesty “The Queen of broken hearts” and says it was a “public show of support” for Andrew. The Express has “Royal fallout over Queen’s ultimate act of love”. On to other matters: the i says “PM in denial over No 10 party fines”; the Telegraph has “Russians give up on conquest of Kyiv” and the Times says much the same. The Metro calls this “Russian roulette”, presumably referring to the risk of taking the Kremlin at its word. And lastly the top story in the Financial Times is “Russia and EU in stand-off as Putin digs in on rouble payments for gas”.
