3/2/2022,"A Russian billionaire named in EU sanctions “as one of Vladimir Putin’s closest oligarchs” stepped down on Tuesday as a trustee of the Royal Academy, which has also returned a donation he made towards a Francis Bacon exhibition. The RA – which had had been among UK cultural institutions and bodies facing calls to sever ties with Russian oligarchs after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – said that the billionaire banker Petr Aven would be stepping down with immediate effect. Aven, the head of Russia’s largest commercial bank and a member Russia’s business elite, was pictured at the Kremlin listening to Putin discuss how to cope with western sanctions. In Britain, where he has resided, Aven is an avid art collector and donor to British cultural institutions including Tate and the Royal Academy, whose president is the Prince of Wales. He and his business partner, the London-based businessman Mikhail Fridman, responded to the EU sanctions by describing them as “spurious and unfounded”. Aven took issue with how he was described in the EU sanctions notice, rejecting the claims that he had benefited from government connections and that he and Fridman were “unofficial emissaries for the Russian government”. Asked about Aven’s position at the RA, a spokesperson said: “Petr Aven has stepped down as a trustee of the Royal Academy Trust with immediate effect and the Royal Academy has returned his donation towards the Francis Bacon: Man and Beast exhibition.” Masha Batsii, a Ukrainian artist based in London, said of Aven’s role at the RA: “It is absolutely inappropriate for any art institution to associate with a Russian oligarch, no matter their background. There’s no art in the face of death and human suffering – and I strongly believe that we need to unite all our strength and resources to target Putin’s autocracy and to weaken it – oligarchs being an important part of Putin’s strength.” Tate is also facing pressure to sever its ties to another Kremlin-linked Russian oligarch who has already been the target of US sanctions since 2018. Viktor Vekselberg, the founder of a Russian energy conglomerate and an associate of Vladimir Putin, is an honorary member of the prestigious Tate Foundation in recognition of past donations, the gallery has confirmed. Chris Bryant, the Labour MP chair of the all-party parliamentary group on Russia, told the Guardian : “We need to use every single sanction available to us: financial, cultural and sporting. We can’t be the generation that stood by while naked aggression stalked Europe. “Of course Putin supporters should be removed from our cultural institutions and galleries and museums should run a mile from blood-drenched Russian money.” A Tate spokesperson said there are no UK sanctions on any of Tate’s supporters. As well as targeting Fridman and Aven, another oligarch with British ties who was caught up in the latest EU sanctions is Alisher Usmanov, an Uzbek-born billionaire whose holding company, USM, own the naming rights to Everton football club’s Finch Farm training ground. “Alisher Usmanov has already been sanctioned by the EU, but not yet by the UK. But I suspect he’ll be pretty soon on a UK list and Everton should soon be cutting ties with him,” Bryant told MPs during a debate on sanctions in parliament. Usmanov has responded to EU sanctions a statement: “I believe that such a decision is unfair, and the reasons employed to justify the sanctions are a set of false and defamatory allegations damaging my honour, dignity and business reputation.”",Arts/Art and design,Russian billionaire on EU sanctions list quits as Royal Academy trustee,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/01/russian-billionaire-banker-petr-aven-royal-academy-trustee-eu-sanctions
3/2/2022,"Formula One’s governing body the FIA has defied the prevailing opinion across sporting bodies in allowing Russian and Belarusian drivers to continue to compete under a neutral flag. The decision is in direct contradiction to the IOC and Fifa opting to ban their participation after the invasion of Ukraine. The FIA has decided drivers will still be allowed to compete under an FIA flag. The decision was made at an extraordinary meeting of the World Motor Sport Council on Tuesday, called at short notice to address the Russian invasion and how the sport should react, but rather than an expected ban the FIA’s resolution flies in the face of a clearly prevailing belief that sporting sanctions must be made to be felt. A statement from the newly appointed FIA president, Mohammed Ben Sulayem, condemned the Russian invasion and his sadness at events in Ukraine but stopped short of taking genuinely punitive action. He added: “We stand in solidarity with Leonid Kostyuchenko, the President of the Federation Automobile d’Ukraine (FAU) and the wider FIA family in the country. The measures taken today recognise the authority of the FAU in Ukraine and are also aligned with the recommendations recently made by the International Olympic Committee.” Russian and Belarusian flags, symbols or colours will not be allowed to be displayed or anthems played at events. Nor will Russia or Belarus be allowed to hold FIA events. F1 has one Russian driver Nikita Mazepin, who competes for Haas and whose father’s Russian chemical company Uralkali, is the title sponsor of the team. Mazepin will now be allowed to race this season alongside Michael Schumacher’s son Mick. Haas have yet to comment. Last week F1 acted with unusual alacrity to cancel the scheduled Russian Grand Prix the day after the invasion occurred. The FIA did not make a statement at the time and today rather opaquely referred to the event being cancelled for reasons of “Force Majeure”. However last week Sulayem did write to Kostyuchenko, whose response was swift and unequivocal as he called for a ban on Russian and Belarusian competitors from FIA events. The FIA’s response will be interpreted as weak and rightly draw criticism as the majority of the sporting world comes together, united against the aggression. On Monday the International Olympic Committee (IOC) recommended that Russian and Belarusian competitors and officials be excluded from competition. The FIA has been a recognised federation of the IOC since 2012. Fifa and Uefa reacted to the IOC’s stance later on Monday by suspending all Russian national and club teams from competing in their events.

3/2/2022,"The children’s minister has told MPs he “probably wouldn’t be overly happy” for his daughters to share a school boarding house with a pupil identifying as transgender. Will Quince was giving evidence before the Commons education select committee, which heard that schools in England were seeing an increase in the number of children identifying as trans. He was responding to questioning by Caroline Johnson, a consultant paediatrician and Conservative MP for Sleaford and North Hykeham, who said she had been contacted by parents who were concerned about an 18-year-old trans woman sharing a boarding house with their daughters. Johnson said: “The number of children who identify as transgender is increasing and schools need to strike a balance of ensuring that these children can be cared for properly and that their needs are properly met,” while also meeting the needs of the wider school population. She added: “I’ve been contacted as a member of this committee in the last week by parents who are concerned about the presence of an 18-year-old trans woman in the boarding house of their teenage daughters.” She asked Quince what guidance the Department for Education could give to schools to manage these situations “in a sensitive way that provides for the privacy and dignity and wellbeing of all the students”. The minister said the issue was a “bit of a minefield” and told MPs the DfE was working with the Government Equalities Office to create guidance. “I think there are two competing priorities here,” he said. “The first is the 2010 Equalities Act and the importance that all children and young people must be treated equally and where there are protected characteristics, that they’re recognised. But at the same time any school also has legal obligations, a duty to safeguard and protect and promote the welfare of all children.” Quince went on: “On the face of what you just said, as a parent – and in particular a parent of two young girls – I probably wouldn’t be overly happy with the situation you describe.” He said it was made slightly more complex because the case Johnson referred to involved an independent school and suggested parents should speak with the headteacher, the governors – and if necessary the Independent Schools Inspectorate. Pressed on the need for detailed government guidance, the minister said he would talk to the schools minister, Robin Walker, but urged schools to use common sense. “You can give all the guidance in the world that sets out the legal position, but we need schools to first use their common sense and to follow the law as it stands at the moment. I would suggest that the duty to protect and to safeguard should probably override anything else.” A spokesperson for the transgender children’s charity Mermaids said: “The small number of schools that are using financial resources and staff time to organise a blanket ban on trans pupils attending single sex schools is really sad and perplexing – can we think of another marginalised population of young people where this happens? “At the heart of this is a young person who wants to learn, as themselves – it’s actually very simple when you think of it like that. “We look back in history and can recall gender being a reason access was denied to girls and now we have that institution denying access to another marginalised group of learners. When will we learn?”",News/UK news,Schools minister ‘wouldn’t be overly happy’ if his daughters boarded with trans pupil,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/01/schools-minister-wouldnt-be-overly-happy-if-his-daughters-boarded-with-trans-pupil

3/2/2022,"David Mamet’s odd if intriguing two-hander from 1977 is probably one of his lesser-known plays for good reason. The Woods features a young couple arguing out their differences at a remote cabin. This “battle of the sexes” drama is of its own time and place, too generic to be provocative now, but Russell Bolam’s revival offers a meditation on how far sexual politics have progressed. The relationship unravels over the course of a single night, ending in – typically for Mamet – a violent confrontation. Ruth (Francesca Carpanini) and Nick (Sam Frenchum) look like a wholesome 1970s American couple in jeans and plaid shirts. They speak, often in coded ways, about their fears and desires around love. She is initially grating with a plainly stated yearning for commitment; he is a picture of coiled masculinity, cornered by her heavy hints of a shared future together. The play contains Mamet’s hallmarks in dialogue and his preoccupation with sex, power and control but the language has a poetic, dreamy and non-naturalistic edge, the couple telling each other stories about falling into holes, seeing martians and getting lost in the woods. There is a strong undertow of the unsaid and of double meanings. The production does not feel static even though its three acts comprise little more than conversations on the porch, with occasional interludes of physicality, artfully orchestrated here. It begins with woozy talk about nature, desire and the earth, and seems like a joint stream of consciousness, as if the pair are talking in half-sleep or drunkenness. But it hits spikier ground as the couple quibble, make up, get tetchy again. As their conflicts grow we hit Mamet’s recognisable rat-a-tat exchanges of staccato dialogue, with the occasional flip back to wooziness. She seems slightly cliched in her initial pleading, and he in his withholding, but Ruth grows in strength and complexity over the course of the drama. Nick, however, seems forever trapped in a reductive straitjacket of masculinity that, while excellently performed, seems like a cardboard incarnation of manhood. He takes the stereotype of the commitment-phobic male to ludicrous heights, almost deranged by his fear of settling down alongside his romanticising of it. Even in the play’s weaker moments, the performances keep us gripped. Carpanini and Frenchum capture the tonal ambiguities between the couple and walk the line between aggression and sexual attraction well. Anthony Lamble’s set is a porch with a tree trunk almost nestling among the audience, and extended pauses between scenes heighten the tension. Ali Taie’s sound design and Bethany Gupwell’s lighting are jagged, suggesting a potential for this romance to sour into horror before the night is out, even if the play, ultimately, does not supply a satisfactory enough end.

3/2/2022,"The Russian state-backed television channel RT is set to disappear from Sky TV in the UK within the next 24 hours, irrespective of the outcome of an investigation by the media regulator Ofcom into its coverage of the war in Ukraine. The plug will be pulled as a result of European Union sanctions, which will target the company used to broadcast RT across the continent. Sky receives its RT broadcast from a satellite operator based in Luxembourg, which will be instructed to remove the news channel formerly known as Russia Today, as soon as the European Union sanctions are officially approved on Tuesday night. RT’s broadcast slot on Sky will initially be blank but the channel will eventually be removed from its programme guide altogether. Representatives of British broadcast platforms Freesat and Freeview were initially unclear as to whether the decision to block the satellite signal would also result in RT vanishing from their platforms. Ofcom is currently investigating RT for 15 potential breaches of the broadcasting code on impartiality in relation to its Ukraine coverage. However, there is unlikely to be an update on this process for several days and any decision on potentially revoking RT’s licence could take longer. Despite substantial political pressure to ban the channel in the UK, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has warned of the risk of banning RT, which has a small audience in Britain. She told the House of Commons: “The reality is that if we ban RT in the United Kingdom, that is likely to lead to channels like the BBC being banned in Russia. What we want is the Russian population to hear the truth about what Vladimir Putin is doing, so there’s a very careful judgment to be made.” In a separate decision, YouTube has already blocked RT’s streams from being accessed across Europe, including in the UK, cutting one of its main routes to the western public. RT has lost several members of staff from its English-language service in recent days, following intense criticism of its coverage. The channel initially framed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a “special military operation” but on Tuesday it began referring to it as a “war”, with sources suggesting this was due to staff discomfort. An spokesperson for SES, which operates the satellite, said: “We have been working very closely with the [Luxembourg] government on a European-coordinated approach that would enable the European Union to swiftly adopt a regulation that would allow global operators like ourselves to suspend specific Russian channels promptly and with certainty.”",News/Media,Russian-backed RT channel to lose Sky TV slot in UK within 24 hours,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/01/russian-backed-rt-channel-to-lose-sky-tv-slot-in-uk-within-24-hours
