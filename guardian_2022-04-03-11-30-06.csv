4/3/2022,"Labor has no plans to increase taxes on Australians and will look to lift foreign aid if elected in May, the shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has said. The senior frontbencher said on Sunday that federal Labor’s only tax proposal was to crack down on multinational tax avoidance. Chalmers’ clear statement was an attempt to clarify the Labor party’s position after the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, failed to rule out new taxes last week. Labor is also under pressure from the Coalition to cost its promise to fund pay increases in aged care as the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, revealed on Sunday the government may only part-fund increases in the private sector. On Friday, Albanese said Labor would announce a policy on “multinational tax evasion” but would not take forward any tax measures proposed before the 2019 election – which the Coalition argued didn’t rule out other potential tax increases. Chalmers told Sky News on Sunday that Labor didn’t “have any proposals for tax increases beyond working with other countries to make multinational tax fairer” – labelling any claims to the contrary a “scare campaign”. Chalmers confirmed Labor would not propose to increase taxes on trusts, a 2019 election policy that he had reportedly privately proposed to pursue as recently as 2021. “The government wants to re-prosecute the last election campaigns because they have no ideas for the future,” he said. Asked about the fact Australia spends $1 on foreign aid for every $12 on defence, down from a ratio of one to six, Chalmers said people could “see the consequences” of the reduction. This includes aid to Solomon Islands which is down 21% since 2018-19. On Thursday, China and Solomon Islands initialled elements of their proposed security agreement, pushing ahead with a deal that could allow Chinese naval vessels to dock just 2,000 km from Australia with the Pacific nation’s consent. “We need to do much better than that, obviously, when you consider the challenges in our region amongst our nearest neighbours,” Chalmers said on Sunday. “We will have a policy on the Pacific which goes beyond the government slogan of a ‘Pacific step-up’ – foreign aid will be part of that, but so will climate change, so will better-quality defence spending. “Our obligation to our neighbours and Australians … is to do a much better job managing those relationships – because the consequences of mismanaging is dire.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On the ABC’s Insiders, Frydenberg took aim at Labor for its promise to absorb the cost of the Fair Work Commission’s ruling in a work value case in which unions are seeking pay rises of $5 an hour for aged care workers. Frydenberg said Albanese had been “all at sea” with “the costings of his open-ended promises”. He said the Coalition would “take responsibility” for pay increases in government-run aged care, but when it comes to the private sector its contribution would be determined by the independent pricing authority. “We’re saying that there’s an independent pricing authority that determines based on all of the input costs what that increase in subsidy will be,” the treasurer said. “You’ve got to wait to see what actually that decision is and therefore, how much that will cost.” The comments suggest that despite Scott Morrison promising to “honour” the FWC decision, the Coalition may not fully fund the pay increase in the private sector – despite unions and the aged care sector insisting they should. Frydenberg was also forced to explain comments from the assistant treasurer, Michael Sukkar, in parliament which suggested the cost of medicines on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) would be reduced from $42.50 to $32.50 from May. Frydenberg claimed that Sukkar was referring to a $525m budget measure to reduce the threshold for the PBS safety net for patients with multiple scripts. “What Michael was talking about was the 2.4 million people who will benefit with the reduction in getting multiple scripts.”",News/Australia news,"Labor has no plans to increase taxes on Australians if elected, Jim Chalmers says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/03/labor-has-no-plans-to-increase-taxes-on-australians-if-elected-jim-chalmers-says
4/3/2022,"Ukrainian troops have retaken the entire Kyiv region, but they have discovered widespread evidence of what the Kyiv government says are war crimes committed by Russian forces. This includes bodies found in the streets, evidence of killings of civilians, mass graves and murdered children. One woman, Halyna Tovkach, says her husband was killed by Russians along with two children and their mother while they were trying to flee the fighting in Bucha. Also allegedly among the civilians killed by the Russians was Olha Sukhenko, the head of the village Motyzhin east of Kyiv, and her entire family. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and a number of other authorities have accused Russian troops of leaving behind mines and other explosives in their retreat of the Kyiv region. In Irpin, crews have found 643 explosive objects. Russia has specifically been accused by Ukraine’s attorney general of using children as “human shields” while regrouping its forces, as the first witness accounts from the newly liberated town of Bucha, north-west of Kyiv, emerge. Coaches of children were said to have been placed in front of tanks in the village of Novyi Bykiv, close to the encircled city of Chernihiv, 100 miles north of Kyiv. Zelenskiy repeated his warning that Russian troops want to capture the Donbas and the south of Ukraine. In his nightly video address, the Ukraine president said “we are aware that the enemy has reserves to increase pressure in the east” but complained that western allies had not sent enough anti-missile systems. Ukraine’s peace negotiator reportedly said that Russia ‘“verbally” accepts the Ukrainian position on peace talks, AFP reported, except for the issue of Crimea. Moscow had also agreed that a referendum on the neutral status of Ukraine “will be the only way out of this situation.” Turkey is the likeliest venue for peace talks between Zelenskiy and Vladimir Putin, Interfax Ukraine has reported. A Red Cross convoy heading to Mariupol will try again to evacuate civilians from the besieged port as Russian forces ​appeared to be regrouping for new attacks in the south-east. A spokesperson for the Red Cross said: “Our team is on the move this morning from Zaporizhzhia to Mariupol. I’m not able to give further information at this stage.” Maksim Levin, a Ukrainian photographer, was also found dead near Kyiv. The defence ministry said Levin, whose work appeared in reports from the BBC and Reuters, had been shot twice by Russian soldiers. The UK said authorities were working to collect evidence of Russian war crimes. Liz Truss, Britain’s foreign secretary, tweeted that she was looking at new information coming out of the Kyiv region. The Baltic states have halted all Russian oil imports, and are encouraging the rest of the European Union to follow suit. UK military intelligence says Russia has still not been able to destroy Ukraine’s air force and air defences. This failure has “seriously hampered their efforts to gain broad control of the air, which in turn has significantly affected their ability to support the advance of their ground forces on a number of fronts”. Pope Francis has come the closest he has yet to implicitly criticising Vladimir Putin over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, by saying a “potentate” was fomenting conflicts for nationalist interests.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 39 of the Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/03/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-39-of-the-russian-invasion
