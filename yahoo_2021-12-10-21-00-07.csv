Subscribe Thursday, December 10, 2021 Last Sunday, after nearly suffering a heart-attack watching Pittsburgh play Baltimore in a classic Steelers-Ravens thriller, I attended my first concert of the pandemic era: Genesis, which played to a packed-to-the-rafters crowd at Madison Square Garden. Tomorrow afternoon, I’ll be indulging in yet-another COVID-era first that’s also been on my personal bucket list for years. I’ll be watching the Black Knights play the Midshipmen in the annual Army-Navy game. I’m also an entertainment junkie who’s in the movie theater at least once a week, and I’m known to dine indoors — a LOT. And it bears mentioning that all of the above, at least in New York City, require full vaccination (in the interest of full disclosure, I am). Believe it or not, my reason for sharing this information is not to boast about my social life, or virtue signal about vaccinations. It's meant to illustrate an important point about the virus and human behavior, which have played an integral part in propelling the economy for the better part of the last two years. The appearance of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 rocked markets, which up until Thursday’s retreat that squashed a 3-day rally, had recouped nearly all of its gains — a reversal so dramatic investors had begun dismissing it as “Omi-whatever.” It's still very early days and caution is advised. Yet signs, including price action in major markets, are pointing to the variant being less fatal, even if it's significantly more communicable than Delta. Case counts are already jumping everywhere — even among highly vaccinated populations — so more restrictions on public life (or the unlikely but still non-zero probability of full-on lockdowns) can’t be entirely ruled out. But with all that being said… Amid the battles breaking out over vaccine mandates and the impact on those who have chosen not to be inoculated against COVID, there’s strong evidence to suggest that people are “over it,” as the kids say these days. None of this is meant to dismiss the toll the virus continues to take on the globe, where the death toll has spiraled inexorably higher (over 5 million worldwide and counting), even with the presence of vaccines. To be sure, there are many with underlying conditions, or loved ones considered high risk, who are still cautious or outright paranoid, and with good reason. Yet evidence everywhere suggests that vast numbers of people — and not just the mostly maskless hordes gathered to watch Phil Collins and Company at the Garden — are moving beyond living in self-imposed exile to a strategy of risk assessment and mitigation. Holiday gatherings, including office parties, are starting to look a lot like they did pre-COVID. To wit: Just before Thanksgiving, air travel hit the highest levels of the pandemic era; In the metropolitan New York/New Jersey area, ridership on public transportation has rebounded sharply as workers slowly return to offices and make their way to events, (although still below pre-COVID levels). 2/2If there is one metric that summarizes New York City's rebound from COVID, it might be subway usage.As the next chart shows, they have a long way to go. pic.twitter.com/ULansD9cqV — Jim Bianco biancoresearch.eth (@biancoresearch) December 6, 2021 And all over the world, more people are getting out and about. Global mobility data from Deutsche Bank “suggests that on a population-weighted basis, most of the world is back close to pre-pandemic levels of mobility,” the bank said in a research note this week. “As the winter COVID wave and Omicron hit us, in aggregate mobility hasn’t yet dipped,” chief economist Jim Reid wrote. “This either shows people are learning to live with the virus more or that it’s too early to tell as travel and domestic restrictions, only very recently imposed, have yet to fully take their toll, with more possibly to come.” Perhaps, but the “learning to live” aspect is what is most important to understanding why stocks have recouped their losses from the “Black Friday” sell-off. In fact, Matt Roberts, newly publicly-traded Vacasa's (VCSA) CEO, told Yahoo Finance's Alexis Christoforous this week that bookings continue to outperform, even with Omicron swirling. ""We posted amazing Q3 results when the Delta variant was spiking. It's partly because we're domestic focused and whole homed. So, if anything, we are quite insulated from any new variants,"" Roberts said. The rise of new variants is a very real risk. Yet all the high frequency data that continue to defy expectations, especially those showing how hot the labor market remains, suggest that demand is sky high. That means even people fearful of COVID are still coming out of their bubbles. “The response to Omicron may dampen the economic outlook in the near term,” wrote Thomas Torgerson, co-head of sovereign ratings at DBRS Morningstar, in research this week. “At present, we view these risks as contained and unlikely to derail the global economic recovery as consumers and businesses continue to adapt and learn to live with the risks,” he added. For many (but certainly not all), ""learning to live"" with COVID has become something of a credo. So whether vaccinated, unvaccinated, or just plain over it (I count myself firmly in the latter camp), people are weighing the risks, but seem to be erring on the side of enjoying life’s creature comforts.

12/10/2021,"A woman who pleaded guilty to partaking in the Capitol riot is preparing for prison. Jenna Ryan told Insider she's been researching what life is like behind bars. Ryan said she's watching YouTube videos, learning slang, and speaking to prison consultants. A Capitol rioter who flew to Washington, DC, on a private jet said she's preparing for her 60 days behind bars by learning prison slang and speaking to prison consultants. Jenna Ryan was last month sentenced to 60 days in a Texas prison after pleading guilty to a single federal misdemeanor charge of parading in the Capitol, according to court documents seen by Insider. Ryan, a realtor who lives in Dallas, Texas, is due to go to a minimum-security federal prison in north Texas sometime after January 3, she told Insider. She said she hasn't been designated a specific facility yet. To prepare herself for life behind bars, Ryan said she's been reading books, doing online research, and watching YouTube videos about prison. ""I've been doing a lot of reading and research lately ... I now know that the general rules are, you don't talk to anybody. You watch out who you talk to. You don't ask anybody what they did. It's just a totally different world,"" she said. ""But since I'm also a life coach, I can imagine that I'll end up making some pretty genuine connections while I'm there."" Ryan said she plans on losing weight in prison because she thinks she will be served ""the worst food imaginable."" In a TikTok posted over the weekend, she said she wants to practice yoga and detox from alcohol. She told Insider she mostly wants to ""hunker down"" and ""keep to herself"" while she's there, and if possible, ""borrow books from the library."" ""I'm going to keep my mouth shut. I'm going to be probably in a little lockdown area with what I would assume will be a 'bunkie' — I'm learning all this new terminology,"" she said. (A ""bunkie"" is prison slang for a roommate.) On top of her own research, Ryan said she's also been speaking to prison consultants, who she said have reassured her that her sentence will go by quickly. Despite all her preparations, Ryan told Insider she still worries about the condition of the prison and her safety. ""I've watched all these videos about minimum-security prison, and the main concern is not the other inmates but that you're treated very, very cruelly by the guards,"" she said. ""I'm going to be treated poorly for 48 days. I may have people that try to run hustles on me, try to trick me."" Ryan is among a small number of Capitol riot defendants who have pleaded guilty and has previously expressed remorse for her actions on January 6. She told Insider she doesn't regret attending the ""Stop the Steal"" rally that preceded the insurrection, but said she ""shouldn't have gone"" into the Capitol. More than anything, she said she hopes to move past January 6 and get on with her life. ""I cannot wait to go [to prison], really. Because the sooner I can get in, the sooner I can get out,"" she said.

12/10/2021,"The problem with being a president who promises to clean things up after a villainous predecessor is that the press corps treats you like a superhero—which sounds like a good thing until you realize that just means you get blamed for things you can’t control. That’s what happened to Jimmy Carter, and it’s what’s happening to Joe Biden now thanks to what Dartmouth political scientist Brendan Nyhad has called “the Green Lantern Theory” in which voters believe a president can do anything through sheer willpower, like the DC superhero. That mistaken belief, says Nyhad, leads to the belief that legislative failures result from a lack of will. Nyhad cites the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Biden signed into law earlier this year, “the most significant piece of legislation passed for working families in many, many decades.” When one of Biden’s core promises, the $15-an-hour wage, failed to make the final bill, progressives argued that Biden didn’t fight hard enough. An analysis of media coverage using algorithms focused on adjectives and where they’re placed in reporting found that Biden got treated as badly or worse in his first year as president than his predecessor, who routinely lied to the American people, delighted in violating democratic norms, and used a fascistic term for reporters, calling them “enemies of the people.” History, the GOP, and Green Lantern-Thinking: The Panama Canal Treaty The study used artificial intelligence to scan the coverage in a “sentiment analysis” that bears out what the White House is up against. Simply put, Biden can’t catch a break. He’s signed two consequential pieces of legislation into law with a third possible by the end of the year, and that’s with razor-thin margins in Congress. Biden has done a better job containing COVID than his predecessor, whose flagrant refusal to self-isolate after he was secretly found to test positive put hundreds of people at risk unnecessarily. White House Chief of staff Ron Klain tweeted out Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank calling on the media to be “partisans for democracy” instead of being as adversarial with a president trying to pass a bill as they were with the guy who is still trying to overthrow the election. “We expected Biden to return us to normality and it hasn’t happened. It’s not necessarily his fault, but people aren’t grading on a curve,” says Jack Pitney, a professor of American politics at Claremont McKenna College. Trump benefited from low expectations, says Pitney, recounting how in early 2017, after watching Trump deliver pretty standard remarks honoring a fallen Navy SEAL, CNN commentator Van Jones enthused that was the moment Trump became president. There were other moments early on, but none endured. “Trump briefly exceeded a low baseline while Biden after a year hasn’t returned us to normalcy.” A similar phenomenon occurred after Richard Nixon resigned from the presidency in disgrace. After a brief interregnum with Gerald Ford, who was appointed and not elected, there was an expectation that the next president, Jimmy Carter, who promised “a government as good as its people” and that he would never lie, would receive more favorable treatment from the media compared to what Nixon had gotten for committing criminal acts in covering up the break-in of Democratic headquarters at the Watergate hotel. But when Carter on his first full day in office in 1977 pardoned Vietnam draft dodgers, the Democratic left was unhappy because he did not pardon draft deserters. The Republican right was furious that he pardoned anyone, and Carter didn’t get much credit for a bold move fulfilling a campaign promise—a pattern that we see repeated in Biden’s presidency. Jimmy Carter Took Me to Sunday School — Literally Carter quickly became a punching bag and an object of some ridicule epitomized in the killer rabbit episode that’s funny in retrospect but was enormously politically damaging in 1979, portraying Carter as weak and hapless as he was preparing to run for re-election. After what seemed like relentless battering from the press, Jody Powell, Carter’s press secretary, said he had begun to wonder if Richard Nixon had gotten a raw deal. He was only half-joking. Jonathan Alter, a Daily Beast columnist and author of a new biography of Carter, His Very Best, argues that Carter was made and unmade by Watergate—that he never would have become president without the contrast with Nixon’s scandal, and that his presidency was partly destroyed by the standards of a post-Watergate press corps driven by a finely honed cynicism. Alter recalled in a conversation that Jody Powell famously said, “We didn’t have a honeymoon. We didn’t even have a one-night stand.” Yet in his first year, Carter never went below 50 percent. He didn’t sink as low as Biden, though he would later go down to 28 percent in the summer of 1979. His early speeches warning of an energy crisis and calling it “the moral equivalent of war” were duds according to New York Times columnist William Safire, who trumpeted the acronym MEOW. Formerly a press counselor in the Nixon White House, Safire wanted to affix a “gate” on every Carter flap. “The entire press corps took their lead from Safire, who was a Nixon hit man,” says Alter. After President Reagan was inaugurated, there was a collective sense of stepping back and examining the media’s role. Initially, Reagan held press conferences in the afternoon, and the networks would use their evening broadcasts to point out whatever mistakes he made. The White House retaliated by holding press conferences in the evening in primetime. The public loved it, the mistakes didn’t matter. None of the petty stuff stuck to Reagan, who was dubbed “Teflon” by then Democratic Rep. Pat Schroeder. With the exception of the purely partisan press, no reporter wants to be seen as “in the tank” for any political figure. Biden’s experience is similar to Carter’s—a more conventional president taking office with a press corps accustomed to a diet of headline-making stories. “The press corps wants to prove they’re not one-sided and the little miscues that wouldn’t have made the list of a thousand Trump outrages, they beat up on Biden for in the same way they beat up on Carter for things that wouldn’t have made the cut under Nixon,” says Alter. In the course of writing his book on Carter, Alter says he spoke to a number of reporters from the Carter-Reagan era “who agreed they were too tough on him” and “questioned his motives too much.” The late Jack Germond, a fabled political columnist, wrote in his memoir, Fat Man in a Middle Seat, that Carter was a good man who got a bum rap. Both Carter and Biden were treated pretty well by the press for the first six months, says Kai Bird, author of the new Carter biography The Outlier. Then reporters began to pound on stories that would fit an editorial theme, he says. For Carter, it was “a bumbling Southern hick who didn’t know the ways of Washington, a guy who paid too much attention to detail and couldn’t see the big picture.” For Biden, the tipping point was the exit from Afghanistan, a policy Biden had telegraphed for months, even years. “That it was messy was inevitable—but clearly not as messy as staying there for another four years,” says Bird. “But now the press is ignoring these fundamentals and focusing entirely on the theme of incompetence. Very unfair.” Biden is being subjected to the same charges of incompetence, and not being up to the job, despite having a more consequential first year than any of his recent predecessors. “And while the press had fun with Carter’s Southern culture,” says Bird, “with Biden it is his age.” It’s something Biden can’t change anymore than Carter could have changed his Southern accent—not that he wanted to—but it is a reminder that the media seeks out larger-than-life inspirational figures, and so do the American people.
