4/15/2022,"The UN this week issued a stark warning on Somalia, projecting that 350,000 children could starve to death without urgent action. The country is in the middle of a drought that is already killing people. Some regions in the Horn of Africa are the hottest they have been since satellites started recording data 40 years ago, according to an analysis by the World Food Programme. Humanitarian aid organisations have spent billions over the years in this east African nation yet few Somalis have felt any real impact. “They spend all their money on overhead and salaries and we are left with pennies,” said Hodan Ali, director of the durable solutions unit for the Benadir regional authority, which contains Mogadishu, the capital. Among a multitude of other costs, money has been spent on security and salaries – in dollars, in the lower six figures for non-Somali UN staff – and logistics, everything from fuel for cars and generators, to laptops, to secure conference rooms. Cash chunks have also gone to the Somali government for “statebuilding”. The government has yet to mount a coherent response to the drought, establishing a committee only in February. All this before money reaches the bare necessities for civilians: food, water and medical supplies. Even the much-lauded direct cash transfer schemes, which many organisations now use as a better, more nimble way of getting help to those in need, come with huge costs for measuring their effectiveness. Consultants are paid in the range of $600 (£450) a day. These processes are considered necessary to prove to donors that money is not going to al-Shabaab, the insurgent group that controls swaths of Somalia and is embedded with much of the population. Abdulahi Abdishakur (who goes by Nadeef) is one of a few Somalis mobilising direct aid. Like many, he feels bewilderment and anger with the UN and international aid agencies, which are seen as wasting time and money, complicit with the Somali government, and prone to misallocating resources and getting waylaid by politics. Nadeef raises money from the diaspora to buy water from private companies that have drilled wells, and then to get it on to trucks. He does his planning from Iowa, where he settled with his immediate family in 2005, spending between $100 and $400 to organise water trucks to supply a remote village. He has relatives across Somalia and visits nearly every year. “You can bring water for very little, but the politicians are focusing on elections,” said one Somali, referring to the protracted political crisis. They asked to remain anonymous but said they knew of water trucks that could be obtained for as little as $150, although it is now getting more expensive. Adam Abdelmoula, UN humanitarian coordinator for Somalia, does not deny the problem. “The absence of a functioning government for so many decades allowed humanitarian actors – including within the UN and among non-government organisations – to devise whatever interventions they deemed fit and implement them without any government oversight,” he said. “This led to what could be described as a culture of ‘humanitarian impunity’. Given how long those practices prevailed in Somalia and the weak coordination capacities of the newly reconstituted government, some of that culture still lingers on and at times makes it difficult to bring the humanitarian and development actors to work together along the nexus lines to achieve collective outcomes for the benefit of Somalis in need.” The Gedo drought relief committee (GDRC), a group that supports people in the west of Jubaland – in southern Somalia – has raised nearly $200,000 and funded nearly 600 water trucks, as well as distributing food, according to a member who requested anonymity for security reasons. The GDRC has been able to get the water to areas controlled by al-Shabaab, places where neither the government nor international groups can safely go. “We the committee can raise funds for the affected,” the member said. “When we have enough cash we contact well-known clan elders and they convince al-Shabaab they [the civilians] need assistance the most. So we send them the money and they buy water and report back.” According to the GDRC, no international aid group has been near the people it has supported, although a member does recall that one assessment was conducted last year. “They come just in time to gauge the mortality rate,” said Adam Aw Hirsi, a former senior government official who is now on the national drought relief committee, set up in February. It is difficult to show the GDRC at work because al-Shabaab does not allow the use of smartphones. A few photos have been smuggled out, one published here, of a child in the Balanbaal area, controlled by al-Shabaab. International organisations are helping only the few who reach camps for internally displaced people (IDPs) in government-controlled areas, said the GDRC member. “They are helping, but the question is, who do they have access to help? The plight caused by this drought is far greater than some few families gathered in an IDP camp. The people that really need assistance are those that are in hard-to-reach areas whose livestock have been depleted and have nothing left,” they said. A failure to consult with people does not help, said Aw Hirsi. “The aid organisations failed to closely coordinate with the local actors on the ground and elsewhere. Close coordination will prevent a gap in aid allocation and delivery, and overlap in resources. Our committee has raised an alarm on both government and aid organisations’ shortcomings.” Drought relief money needs to go straight to “local hands-on actors” to have any impact, he said. Politics also hampers relief efforts. The country is mired in an electoral struggle and there’s deep distrust between regions. Mursal Khalif, minister of international cooperation in Jubaland, has claimed that at least one plane loaded with humanitarian aid has not been allowed to leave Mogadishu. Meanwhile Nadeef’s GoFundMe campaign in the US has raised more than $20,000. He has spent half on sending 70 water trucks across Jubaland, and half on food distribution. The UN agency Unicef has not given a figure for how many water trucks it has sent out but says 110,000 of the 1.2 million people it has targeted have been reached. About 6.4 million people are in need of water and sanitation assistance. The agency says it needs $18m to meet its trucking target, and other support such as water supply systems and boreholes.

Drawing on research from paleontologist Robert DePalma, we follow DePalma’s dig over the course of three years at a new site in North Dakota, unearthing remarkably well-preserved fossilised creatures. Using immersive visual effects, we see how the fossils may explain the dinosaurs’ destruction. Ammar Kalia The pilgrimage reaches Derry, where the gang are joined by table tennis star Will Bayley.

4/15/2022,"There could not have been a more fitting time for Anatomy of a Scandal (Netflix) to arrive. This splashy, trashy drama, a starry adaptation of the novel by Sarah Vaughan, deals with politicians who believe themselves to be above the law, and the blind privilege of the ultra-wealthy. It is a twisty, slippery thing, so the specifics are difficult to discuss without spoiling it. But Sienna Miller is Sophie Whitehouse, happily married to Britain’s “most fanciable” minister, James (a brilliantly oily Rupert Friend), until they find their lives swept up in the scandal of the title. None of these characters speak like human beings. “My darling man, where the fuck are you?” coos Sophie down the phone when her husband fails to turn up to a party. “If the future doesn’t include you, Sophie Whitehouse, then the future is shite,” he coos back, later on. Bleurgh. Maybe this is how posh people woo each other. “You think like a poet … politics could always use more poetry,” says James, but not to Sophie, which is where his most recent troubles begin. He deserves to be put in the dock for that line alone. It unfolds at a pace, half in the present day, half in flashback to Sophie and James’s time at Oxford, where he rowed and was a member of the Bullingdon-esque Libertine club. There is boorish behaviour. People say “boys will be boys” on more than one occasion. People meet in dark corridors to discuss dastardly deals. It is part political thriller, part courtroom drama, and it attempts to wear many hats. On the one hand, it is a twisty thriller that knows it is silly and hams that up. On the other, it attempts a serious exploration of consent and power, which sits uneasily with all the fireworks, and barely begins to unravel the knots it makes for itself. And there are many fireworks. There is a cartoonish bastard of a spin doctor (“Fun on the side with a filly?”) and a feckless prime minister with his own skeletons in the closet. Music swells at a volume not heard since Love Is Blind, with the lyrics similarly explaining what is happening on screen: “How the mighty faaaaalll!” There are surreal flashes of people suddenly appearing in memories of scenes when they were not there, or of the emotional impact becoming literal, and dropping characters from a great height. The cameras appear to have been supping from the subsidised bars in the Commons. Rarely is a scene shot from an angle that isn’t tilted, twisted or upside down. Some scenes start on a wonk and end with the floor on the ceiling. I understand that there is chaos going on, but I felt nauseated after six episodes of it. Anatomy of a Scandal comes from the stable of David E Kelley, who has form with this kind of thing – stoic rich women with slippery handsome husbands – having executive-produced Big Little Lies and The Undoing, among many other shows. (His co-creator here is Melissa James Gibson, who wrote for The Americans and House of Cards.) Considering this deals with the upper echelons of the British class system, it has a distinctly American feel. “The behaviour of entitled toffs is no longer something the public finds cute,” says the spin doctor, though my theory is that in Britain, we only ever did, or do, indulge it from the safe distance of a period drama. Even so, for the first half, I was happily bingeing along, in the same mood as if gobbling up an airport potboiler on the beach. Miller, Friend and Michelle Dockery, who plays a stern barrister called Kate, a woman with a personality best described as “workaholic wearing glasses”, are all clearly trying their best with what they have been given. Although in the end it doesn’t quite land, there are attempts to pick at complex themes of sex, power and manipulation. Later in the series, there is a moment that appears to nod to Brett Kavanaugh’s rage before the US Senate judiciary committee, following Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony. In the stoic rich wife role, Sophie hints at discovering her own privilege and ruthlessness, a curious thread that isn’t taken far enough. Unfortunately, and this is a big unfortunately, there is a twist. I hope this doesn’t count as a spoiler, and I suspect it won’t, because at the moment Netflix’s main selling point is “trashy thriller with a twist” so it feels inevitable that there would be one. When that twist comes, it is so ridiculous and far-fetched that I had spent the previous episodes certain that it could not be the twist, because even this show wouldn’t be so daft. It’s a scandal that it is.

4/15/2022,"Easter is the best holiday, hands down, no debate. In October, when the first Christmas decorations start to appear, it triggers deep dread in all right-thinking people. I’m in the US, where Thanksgiving doesn’t land for me, ditto the Fourth of July. There’s no day off for Halloween, but in any case that’s an occasion just for the kids. Like everything else, Easter has become more commercial – the shops are full of wicker baskets stuffed with shredded paper that once spilled, will never fully be expunged from your home. But relative to other holidays, it feels like the one grownup break in the year. Truly, who can be miserable about the advent of spring? For non-believers raised in a roughly Christian tradition, part of the joy of Easter has to do with it being uncoupled from religion without an attendant secular mythology springing up in its place. “The Easter bunny isn’t real,” said one of my children this week, and after giving it a moment’s thought, I realised she was right. No one sells the Easter bunny as real to their kids, even as we shill desperately for Santa and the Tooth Fairy. I’m not sure why this is; on paper, a giant bunny isn’t any more ludicrous than a fat man flying on a sleigh. But no one cares enough about Easter to put in the ground work and the resulting low pressure of the event is sublime. In fact, it’s barely an event at all. There are no Easter rules, no expense or outlay, and only the most minimal forethought and planning required. Swing by the shops for some Cadbury Mini Eggs and a large chicken and you’re set for the weekend. You can see family if you want, but don’t have to. There’s no Easter equivalent of Friendsgiving, or Friendsmas, at least not one that requires its own word. Being alone at Easter isn’t a thing. You can spend the entire long weekend watching all five seasons of Breaking Bad and eating out of your kettle without fighting off messaging that you’re doing it wrong. Perhaps things feel particularly jolly this year because, unusually, Ramadan, Passover and Easter all align. Like an eclipse, this only happens once every few decades and puts millions of us on the same page. In the US, the public schools shut for a week, so it’s not the two-week juggernaut of the Easter holiday in England. But we get Friday off, the sun has finally come out, and the daffodils at the roadside are blooming. It can be hard to enjoy summer in the knowledge that summer is passing. But at Easter, everything good is to come. And with low expectations, it’s hard for things to derail too disastrously, or for the Easter weekend to be held up against too-vivid memories. As a child, my entire Easter drama consisted of making the chocolate bunny last, starting at the ears and nibbling half an inch a day so that the greying carcass of its feet were still in the fridge in late May. In my 20s, my presiding memory of Easter is of the bus replacement service; track work that always seemed to be scheduled for that weekend I went home. It didn’t matter. There was no hurry. No one’s in a hurry at Easter. You have days and days to get there; it’s not like the mad Christmas Eve dash. If you faff about on Good Friday and miss your train, you still have the whole of Saturday to get home, and if you miss Easter Sunday, there’s still Easter Monday. I’m not saying there aren’t bad memories of Easter in among the good: Harry Secombe singing the Old Rugged Cross on ITV; simnel cake; off-brand chocolate that turned to watery paste in your mouth. In 2002, the Queen Mother died on Easter weekend and I trudged back to London to work. This year, I know a lot of hacks glancing very nervously in the direction of the Queen. It’s only Easter; if anything happens you can’t really say no. But the blossom is out in New York, we’re heading into a chunky break with no commitments, and the summer is yet to come. It has taken a long time to get here. Recognising the superiority of this weekend is something that only comes with maturity, like understanding dark is better than milk chocolate, and cheese is better than any chocolate. Happy Easter.

4/15/2022,"Suffolk folk have long memories, passed down through generations. So the recollections of the late Sidney Rampling of the village of Brettenham, passed on through another local man, Alan Scrivenor, still inform the residents of nearby Lower Road, Rattlesden, about flooding. Scrivenor thought Rampling would not have let farmers use excuses about climate breakdown and heavier bursts of rain. He believed the pub, the Brewers Arms, and other properties along the stream known as the River Rat, would have no need of sandbags to keep out the flash floods if farmers had kept up what Rampling regarded as the proper maintenance of their land. Rampling had lived in Brettenham all his life, except while serving in the second world war, and remembered that farmers once edged all their fields with deep ditches. When the winter rains came the ditches filled with water removing the excess rain. The water level gradually sank in during the spring, keeping the fields moist for the wheat and sugar beet to thrive. Gradually the farmers, with ever heavier machinery and using every inch of land to grow crops, filled in the ditches and ploughed to the edge of the fields. The result is compacted soil and nowhere for the water to run but downhill, causing the flash flooding along Lower Road.",News/News,Memories of bygone era could stop flash flooding in Suffolk village,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/apr/15/memories-of-bygone-era-could-stop-flash-flooding-in-suffolk-village
4/15/2022,"When BBC Three relaunched as a live television channel earlier this year, the corporation hoped its counterintuitive punt on a youth-focused broadcast outlet would help it reach new audiences. Instead, the channel’s shows are consistently being beaten in the ratings by repeats of old history programmes featuring the deceased steeplejack Fred Dibnah on BBC Four. Most of BBC Three’s programmes have so far failed to attract more than 100,000 viewers on live television, according to official viewing figures, while some shows are lucky to get a tenth of that. Even the programmes that do perform relatively well – such as episodes of MasterChef Australia – are rarely the original distinctive in-house shows that the channel exists to provide. As a result, despite years of work to return the channel to air, BBC Three is now being beaten in the ratings by the vintage film channel Talking Pictures and the rightwing current affairs station GB News. Sophia Vahdati, of the analytics firm Digital-i, said BBC Three’s total television audience had halved in its first two months on air, despite an extensive advertising campaign to promote its return. The average daily time spent watching the channel collapsed from 57 seconds to just 17 seconds over the same period. Vahdati said it was a tough market for all traditional broadcast channels aimed at teenagers and 20-somethings: “Young viewers were the first audiences to stop watching traditional TV and instead move to Netflix and Amazon. We expect to see that trend continue with younger generations.” BBC Three was originally taken off air in 2016 as a cost-saving measure, with the BBC arguing that its target audience preferred to watch content on iPlayer. The online-only channel eventually found its feet as the virtual home for some of the BBC’s most acclaimed commissions such as Fleabag and Sally Rooney’s Normal People. However, BBC bosses decided that bringing back BBC Three as traditional linear television outlet could help them reach poorer and more diverse audiences – who are increasingly drifting away from the BBC altogether. A BBC spokesperson said the viewing figures did not fully reflect the popularity of the shows, with many people still choosing to watch them on iPlayer. “Audiences value the option to choose when and where they watch and the channel provides additional visibility and another route to find BBC Three programmes,” they said. There have been some ratings successes, with new episodes of RuPaul’s Drag Race and African Cup of Nations football matches bringing in healthy live audiences. According to Enders Analysis, a media consultancy, the total youth audience for all British television channels has collapsed by 70% over the last decade. The average teenager’s consumption of live television has fallen from almost three hours a day to just 50 minute during this period. The trend has severe implications for other youth-focused broadcasters, such as Channel 4. The short-lived television ratings boom caused by pandemic-related lockdowns has already gone into reverse, with channels increasingly reliant on older audiences, live sport and soap operas. BBC Three’s relaunch – and its subsequent struggle to attract viewers – came at a tricky time for BBC management. Bosses are working out which broadcast services to close or cut in order to meet the latest government-enforced spending cuts. A key decision will be whether to axe some traditional BBC outlets that remain popular with older viewers in order to reallocate their budget in an effort to attract younger audiences.",News/Media,BBC Three: relaunched live TV channel struggles to win viewers,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/15/bbc-three-relaunched-live-tv-channel-struggles-to-win-viewers
4/15/2022,"How do you describe a dark-edged bee-fly (Bombylius major)? I asked a colleague whether I could get away with “flying mole”. She suggested “flying teddy bear” instead. And then there is the unmistakable similarity to a hummingbird. Go into a garden, or anywhere flowery, during a sunny interlude, and you can decide for yourself. Here in our village, bee-flies are easy to see in numerous sheltered spots at the moment, to-ing and fro-ing between the ranks of grape hyacinths and primroses. They are diminutive bee mimics, with rotund bodies covered in fuzz, making them look like effervescent fluffy balls of nervous energy. Each bee-fly uses the delicate hovering skills that you expect from the famous glinting birds, and carefully slots its long proboscis into the tubular flowers, one by one, drinking nectar or extracting pollen. The wings are smart black in front, with transparent trailing edges, and are held open at 45 degrees when their owners finally come to rest in the sun. They are little characters with great charisma, and if a PR company were hired to make much-maligned flies (Diptera) acceptable to the general public, they would come up with Bombylius and make cuddly toys out of them. There would have to be a general hush about their lifestyles, though. Attractive though bee-flies are, they all have something of a past. Every individual comes into this world at the expense of a brood of solitary bees. You can occasionally see adult female bee-flies furtively hovering near the small entrance holes made by the burrowing bees, and if very fortunate you might notice an odd flicking action of the abdomen as they do so. Amazingly, the bee-flies are literally hurling their eggs, which they have covered with sand granules to avoid desiccation, towards the hole. The lucky ones hatch adjacent to the entrance and the larvae then enter and feed on the pollen provided by the solitary bee for its grubs. After this act of food vandalism (kleptoparasitism), the bee-fly larva metamorphoses and turns its voracious appetite to the sweet flesh of the grubs themselves, causing parasitoid carnage. It’s the stuff of horror that is routine in the insect world. But it still feels detached from the sheer charm of the hovering beauties at the spring blooms.
