12/13/2021,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California’s 26-year-old program to get more people to put solar panels on their homes has been wildly successful, but state regulators may lower the incentives for people to go solar in a bid to reduce electricity bills for the rest of residents in the most populous U.S. state. Current incentives allow residential solar customers to sell whatever energy they don’t use back to power companies at the retail rate for power, usually resulting in a big discount on their energy bills. But power companies say the savings are now so great that solar customers are no longer paying their fair share for the operation of the overall energy grid. The future of the program, known as “net energy metering,” has prompted a fierce debate between the state's major utilities and the solar industry. Regulators at the California Public Utilities Commission, which oversees the state's major utilities and the rates they can set, are expected to issue proposed reforms on Monday. It comes as California strives to achieve its ambitious clean energy goals. California’s net metering program launched in 1995 with the goal of boosting solar adoption in the famously sunny state. California now has more than 1.3 million residential solar installations, more than any other state, according to the solar industry. That number will only grow because since 2020 all newly constructed homes in California must have solar panels. But as solar panels proliferated, criticism about the program grew. The major utility companies — Pacific Gas & Electric, San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison — say the current setup allows solar customers to sell their energy back into the grid for more than it's worth. They say more needs to be done to make sure solar customers — most of whom still rely on power from utilities at nighttime — are paying for all the parts of the energy grid they use. Power rates include many costs unrelated to energy generation, like transmission, distribution and even wildfire prevention work. When solar households pay significantly lower electricity bills — or no bills at all — they’re contributing less to those things. That means more of the cost is shouldered by other customers. The utilities peg that cost at $3 billion, though the solar industry disputes that number. The California Public Utilities Commission began a process for reforming the program last year with an eye toward ensuring energy grid maintenance costs are spread equitably and making it easier for residents of all backgrounds to purchase solar panels. Currently, higher-income households are more likely to have solar panels than lower-income households because solar costs a lot of money up front. There are a wide array of opinions on potential reforms — 18 groups including the solar industry, the utilities, ratepayer advocates and environmental groups submitted proposals to state regulators. A five-member commission will vote on the final PUC reform proposal, likely in January. The solar industry warns a dramatic decrease in financial incentives would entice fewer people to add solar panels to their homes, jeopardizing the market and hurting the state's ability to reach its clean energy goals. California is working to power all retail electricity with renewable or zero-carbon energy by 2045. Solar panels on average cost between $20,000 and $25,000 to install on a California home, said Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director at the California Solar and Storage Association, which represents 700 businesses involved in the solar market. It now takes about three to four years for homeowners to recoup installation costs by selling extra energy to the utilities, according to the companies. The utilities have proposed lowering the amount of money solar customers get back, meaning it would take longer — 11 to 15 years — for homeowners to recover their costs. All residential solar customers would also have a “grid benefits charge” and a “customer charge” added to their bills that could be upwards of $70 per month. The utilities' desired changes wouldn't apply to people who already have solar panels on their homes, only those who choose to install solar panels going forward. Low-income customers who install them within three years would pay lower fees. The Utility Reform Network, a consumer advocacy group that’s often fighting with the utilities over rates, also wants to lower what households with solar panels are paid back for excess energy. The group has suggested locking in a 10-year price so homeowners know what they’ll be paid for excess energy before they install solar. They also want to increase the financial incentives for low-income households to participate. “We are focused on affordability for everyone,” said Matt Freedman, staff attorney for the group. The solar industry and its allies, including some environmental justice and clean energy organizations, say regulators should be looking for ways to boost incentives for California residents to buy solar panels, not decrease them. Del Chiaro said the state should also be making it easier for people to buy solar storage systems alongside the panels. Such systems, which cost about $15,000 to install, allow people with solar panels to store their own energy for use when it gets dark, making them less reliant on the energy grid. As more people build storage systems, the utilities will need to spend less on new power plants or transmission lines, she said. But it also means they'll have fewer customers relying on them for energy. “Utilities are really threatened now by batteries,” Del Chiaro said. “They’re really putting up a big fight to try to slow this market down.”",U.S./Associated Press,California may cut rooftop solar incentives as market booms,https://news.yahoo.com/california-may-cut-rooftop-solar-050556906.html
12/13/2021,"An early morning stroll in the Singapore Botanic Gardens turned surreal and nightmarish for one man last month when he was attacked by a pack of smooth-coated otters in an incident that left him with 26 wounds and needing stitches. “I actually thought I was going to die — they were going to kill me,” Graham George Spencer, a British man in his 60s who lives in Singapore, told The Straits Times. In the wake of the Nov. 30, incident, local otter enthusiasts have stressed that otter attacks are rare and typically only occur when the animals feel threatened. In this case, Spencer told Reuters that a jogger had run past him and stepped on one of the otters. The animals sprang into action, but when the jogger moved on, past Spencer, the otters seemed to think he was the man who had stepped on one of their pack. “These otters got attacked, if you will, by being stepped on — and in a moment of confusion they attacked the wrong guy,” Bernard Seah, a photographer who tracks and documents the otters, told the BBC. The case of mistaken identity made it no less harrowing for Spencer, though. He fell to the ground as the otters overtook him and bit him repeatedly for 10 to 12 seconds before his friend was able to rescue him by yelling at the otters and pulling Spencer to safety. The otters involved are a group known as the Zouk family, which currently is made up of nine adults and six pups. The Zouks are a frequent sight at the Singapore Botanic Gardens and Seah told The Straits Times that they are very “human-tolerant” and he had never heard of them behaving aggressively like this before. Dr. Tan Puay Yok, group director of the botanic gardens, said that any park visitors should give wildlife ample space, especially when there are young involved. The Zouks, which get their name from a local nightclub, made headlines in 2020 when COVID-19 lockdowns and the lack of people out in public emboldened them to do things like take a dip in a condo pool and frolic in a children’s hospital lobby. Some Singaporeans derided the otters after they snacked on expensive ornamental fish in a private pond. But as the Los Angeles Times noted, the incident just made some of their fans love them more, as people empathized more with the otters than the ultra-wealthy who have fancy fish ponds.

12/13/2021,"SHARJAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Over a dozen unmarried women huddled in a jail cell south of Dubai last year, locked up for the crime of giving birth, when a guard entered and declared them free. The incident, described by one of the women, was among the first concrete signs that the United Arab Emirates had decriminalized premarital sex in an overhaul of its Islamic penal code. But a year later, these unwed mothers remain trapped in limbo, fighting to obtain birth certificates for babies born in the shadows. A new law that comes into effect in two weeks still does not offer unmarried women a clear path to acquiring birth certificates for their babies. At the same time, the law criminalizes women lacking such documents. Although unwed mothers no longer face jail after the UAE legalized premarital sex in November 2020, they now face a maze of red tape. Obtaining birth certificates for their babies is a costly process that the country's poorest residents — foreign workers who clean offices, serve food and care for the children of other mothers — cannot afford. Expats outnumber locals by nearly nine to one in the Emirates. “We were so full of hope,” said Star, one of those released from Sharjah Central Jail in December 2020 with her 3-month-old daughter. “Then came trouble I didn’t think I’d have the strength to get through.” Star gave only her first name for fear of reprisals. She and six other unmarried women, most of them Filipinas, described their legal battles to The Associated Press. Before last year's law change, several had given birth at hospitals, where health authorities denied them birth certificates and called the police. Others withdrew to their shared apartments, scared and alone, to have their babies. In the UAE, hospitals issue birth certificates only to married parents. Without the certificates, children are unable to receive medical care, attend school or travel. Their mothers, who lost work and residency during prosecution under the old law, become stranded. The number of undocumented children in the UAE is not known. Lawyers say the obstacles stem from an enduring conservative mindset and lack of government coordination. Some women even yearn for the previous punishment, typically one-year detention and deportation. While terrifying, it at least guaranteed a flight home and identity documents for their children. “It has only gotten harder since the law changed,"" said 25-year-old mother Sitte Honey. “They won’t take you to jail and they don't want you to give birth,"" she added, noting abortion is also forbidden. “We're stuck.” Dirar Belhoul Al Falasi, a member of the UAE's advisory Federal National Council, argued last year's decriminalization had an impact. “Prior to this, there was nothing in my hand to legalize what they have,” he told the AP. “But now, there is a law … that we can help them with.” Under a new law that comes into force on Jan. 2, parents who fail to document their children face a minimum of two years in prison. It makes no reference to health authorities issuing birth certificates to single mothers. The law demands that parents marry or acquire travel documents and other paperwork to prove their children’s identities, without detailing how. That has stoked panic among unmarried mothers who fear further punishment. Last year, as lawyers scrambled to understand the opaque legal code, women like Star walked out of jail across the country. Conditions at the facilities varied and in some, mothers were separated from their children. Star said her daughter was taken from her during detention. She said 15 women shared a single bathroom, subsisted on only rice and bread and were let out 30 minutes each day for fresh air. Other women described police interrogations about their sexual history as deeply humiliating. But after these women were freed, they still couldn't get the one thing they wanted most: identity documents. Maya, a 36-year-old mother, turned herself into authorities in November 2020 when she heard it would help her get a birth certificate for her 1-year-old. After several torturous weeks in Dubai’s Al Qusais Police Station, authorities became alerted to the law change and freed her. But they never granted legal status to her daughter, forcing her to ricochet from one government office to another in her quest. “These massive fundamental changes are highly welcome, but so much still needs to catch up,” said Ludmila Yamalova, managing partner of LYLAW, a firm taking on cases of unwed mothers. “Emotionally and mentally, people are not prepared to accept the law as reality,"" she added, referring to health and law enforcement agencies. Women continue to raise undocumented children in secret. Noraida Gamama, desperate to document her 3-year-old daughter, has plastered the door of her Sharjah apartment with signs warning her half-dozen roommates to check the peephole before answering to ensure it's not a government official. Living on expired visas and struggling to feed infants on wisps of income, many can't afford court fees and lawyers’ bills. It costs over $350 to open a birth certificate petition case independently at Dubai’s Family Court. Ann, 36, works multiple part-time jobs, sleeping a few hours a night, to feed her undocumented 2-year-old girl. She recounted the agony of delivering her on the floor of a rented Dubai room. “All I want is to give her a name, to bring her back to the Philippines where she could live a better life,” Ann said. Still, a growing number of women are taking their cases to court, with mixed success. A clerk at one Dubai court said the system handled over 50 “baby cases” daily. When Honey discovered she was pregnant with her boyfriend’s child two years ago, she appealed to the Philippine Consulate to send her home. But while waiting for help that never came, baby Naya was born in her tiny apartment. Lacking legal status after fleeing abusive employers who confiscated her passport, Honey has grown desperate to get out of Dubai. But authorities cannot repatriate her until Naya gets papers. “This is a nightmare. No money, no visa, no rent, no plan,"" Honey said. To hasten her return, Honey's 47-year-old mother moved to Qatar as a housemaid, pulling together the money needed to open a case in Dubai last month. She’s still waiting for her first hearing and trying to get a written acknowledgement of paternity from her ex-boyfriend. The process requires an unwed mother to provide a ream of personal documents, take a DNA test and testify before a judge. If the judge approves, the mother may request her child's birth certificate. Some, like Star, have persevered and made it through. “That kind of joy is overwhelming, to know your daughter is not illegal anymore,” Star said from her family's home in Davao City, Philippines. “It's like I'm breathing for the first time.”",World/Associated Press,"After UAE law change, out-of-wedlock babies still in shadows",https://news.yahoo.com/uae-law-change-wedlock-babies-060921259.html
