4/28/2022,"Jodie Comer’s West End stage debut is a baptism of fire by any standards. A one-woman play about a lawyer who specialises in defending men accused of sexual assault, until she is assaulted herself, it demands frenetic, non-stop physical and emotional engagement from its lead. Comer delivers. She roars through Suzie Miller’s script. The play roars, too, sometimes too loudly in its polemic, but Comer works overtime to elevate these moments. Directed by Justin Martin, Comer’s Tessa Ensler is a ruthlessly competitive young barrister with a sly wit. A state-educated bright spark who survives the gladiatorial contests of Cambridge law school, she is a very different woman before she finds herself on the other side of the witness stand as a rape victim. There is a touch of Killing Eve’s Villanelle in Comer’s darkly comic – almost camp – performance in the opening scene, which finds her shooting down a witness in court and describing it in the style of a saloon-bar showdown. Her character treats the law as a bloodsport and justifies tearing down the testimonies of women who claim assault by citing the legitimacy of “legal truth” (whatever can be proved beyond doubt) above actual truth. Comer has a lot to carry, playing every character, and is even tasked with moving tables around in a production whose stagecraft is filled with oddities, though its has a strong central set (design by Miriam Buether): a barrister’s chambers that is all leather chairs and oak tables, with floor-to-ceiling case files. It becomes stripped down to blackness as it progresses, with chairs tipped over and pelting rain. A musical heartbeat effectively accompanies tense moments (sound design by Ben and Max Ringham) but other compositions (by Rebecca Lucy Taylor AKA Self Esteem) conjure the ambient electronic sounds of an Ibiza beach bar, while the lighting design (by Natasha Chivers) is full of manic flashes. Comer is in almost constant motion, and we wait for her energy to falter but at no point does it sag. Though entirely different in subject matter, her performance matches that of Rafe Spall’s in the monologue Death of England. She swaggers, too, like a female version of David Mamet’s adrenalised men, jumping up on a table to enact a scene at court, sliding out of her wig and suit into a slinky dress, throwing a packet of half-eaten crisps at the audience and swivelling in a chair as she speaks of having office sex. She masterfully manages the dramatic shift to the assault, holding us rapt and horrified, though Tessa’s decision to take to the witness stand herself is not entirely convincing, story-wise, for a woman who knows that “the law on sexual assault spins on the wrong axis” and that women are so often doomed to lose. The professional strategist and cynic of the start seems too far removed from the believer in true justice she later becomes. Comer’s performance compensates for the clompy-footed parts of Miller’s script, which falls into a loudly lecturing tone at the end. But Prima Facie’s final messages are urgent in highlighting who our laws fail to protect. If they are delivered in hammer blows, there is power in hearing them spoken on a West End stage, and Comer manages to infuse breath-taking emotional drama in every last word.

4/28/2022,"Ministers will formally start the process of privatising Channel 4 on Thursday – despite widespread opposition from the British media industry, the broadcaster’s current management, and a large number of Conservative MPs. The government insists that the publicly owned channel needs to be sold off, but there are doubts over whether they have the political support required to pass the necessary legislation. Ministers will also finally publish the conclusions of a 60,000-strong public consultation on the sale, with most comments expected to be against privatisation. The announcement will be made as part of a range of legislative measures that will change the British media industry, including proposals to require broadcasters to make “distinctively British” programmes rather than show set in “non-specific locations, with an international cast, communicating in US English”. Among the new media policies due to be confirmed in parliament on Thursday are a series of reforms designed to boost the UK’s public service broadcasters – which consist of the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and S4C. The law on televising “crown jewel” sporting events could also be changed to cover streaming platforms. This could ensure Britons can watch all Olympics events for free, potentially undoing the recent rights deal with US media company Discovery, which reduced the BBC’s coverage and forced viewers to pay if they wanted to watch streams of all the events. Other measures, which will be detailed in full in a white paper on Thursday, include: Regulating the content on streaming services such as Netflix or Amazon Prime Video, giving the public the ability complain about offensive or inaccurate programmes in the same way they can already complain about programmes on broadcast television. Failure to comply could result in a service being fined up to 5% of its revenue. Legally requiring television manufacturers to prominently feature British public service broadcasters on the homescreens of smart TVs. Relaxing the rules on how broadcasters can meet their public service obligations, enabling them to fulfil the requirements by putting shows on more obscure channels. Although public service television broadcasters broadly welcomed the proposals, the British radio industry complained that the government had ignored their pleas to force smart speaker devices such as Amazon’s Alexa to be required to carry their services. By far the biggest announcement is the decision to push ahead with the privatisation of Channel 4. It operates as a publicly owned outlet that carries advertising, and is required to reinvest its profits into new programming rather than hand over the money to shareholders. At the moment the broadcaster has an unusual business model devised by Margaret Thatcher’s government, which requires it to commission all of its shows from independent businesses – something the government proposes to rip up as part of its reforms. On Wednesday the culture minister Julia Lopez told the House of Commons that the government has concluded Channel 4 needs private ownership in order to survive, even though almost the entire British media industry is publicly opposed to the plan. She also faced strong opposition from her own MPs over the proposal, with many concerned about potential job losses in their constituencies if a new owner prioritises profits over giving shows to small, independent producers. Sir Peter Bottomley, the father of the house, told the House of Commons on Wednesday: “Channel 4 is in the best state it’s been creatively and financially for decades.” The Tory MP suggested that ministers may have been offended by some of its news coverage – such as replacing Boris Johnson with a melting ice sculpture in a climate breakdown debate – and added that the “government could do best by leaving it alone”. Damian Green, another former Tory minister, expressed “profound scepticism” about the government’s privatisation plans and said the media industry was united in “saying Channel 4 isn’t broke and doesn’t need fixing in this way”.",News/Media,Channel 4 privatisation to begin amid criticism from MPs and industry,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/27/channel-4-privatisation-to-begin-amid-criticism-from-mps-and-industry
4/28/2022,"Presidents and dignitaries gathered in Washington on Wednesday to remember Madeleine Albright, the first woman to serve as US secretary of state, while drawing upon her life’s work to warn of the increasing precariousness of freedom and democracy. Family members and colleagues of Albright shared loving and affectionate memories of her during the funeral service at Washington National Cathedral, while US leaders reflected on her legacy. “Freedom endures against all odds in the face of every aggressor because there are always those who will fight for that freedom,” US president Joe Biden said in his eulogy of Albright, who died of cancer last month at the age of 84. “In the 20th and 21st century, freedom had no greater champion than Madeleine Korbel Albright.” Russia’s war in Ukraine hung heavily over the service, as those who eulogized Albright remembered her denunciation of Russian president Vladimir Putin’s invasion during her final days. In her last opinion piece, for the New York Times, which was published just weeks before her death, Albright wrote: “Ukraine is entitled to its sovereignty, no matter who its neighbors happen to be. In the modern era, great countries accept that, and so must Mr. Putin.” For Albright, the right of a country to determine its own destiny was personal. Born in Czechoslovakia in 1937, Albright’s family fled the country in the face of the Nazi occupation. After enduring the Blitz bombing in London, Albright’s family returned to Czechoslovakia once second world war ended, only to be driven out again amid the rise of communism. Her family then emigrated to the United States aboard a ship called the SS America. Former US president Bill Clinton, who nominated Albright first as US ambassador to the United Nations and then as secretary of state, noted on Wednesday at the funeral that her life was “sort of a microcosm of the late 20th century in Europe and the United States”. “Today we see in Ukraine all too tragically what Madeleine always knew – that the advance of freedom is neither inevitable or permanent. And that in politics, where the lure of power is strong and the temptation to abuse it is often irresistible, there are no permanent victories or defeats,” Clinton said. Albright’s funeral service came two months after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, and the war is now poised to enter a new, potentially more dangerous phase. A series of explosions in the neighboring country of Moldova has raised the threat of a larger regional conflict in eastern Europe. Multiple speakers at the Wednesday’s service, which was attended by more than 1,400 people, referenced Albright’s 2018 book on fascism as they addressed the devastation in Ukraine. In her book Fascism: A Warning, Albright sounded the alarm about the rise of autocratic leaders and the need to protect democratic governments. “She knew better than most – and she warned us in her book on fascism – that yes, it can happen here. And time and courage are of the essence,” said Hillary Clinton, who followed in Albright’s footsteps to become secretary of state, in the Obama administration. “If Madeleine were here with us today, she would also remind us this must be a season of action,” Clinton added. While the US and its allies work frantically to help Ukraine fend off Russian attacks, Biden took a moment to commend Albright’s commitment to the US-led Nato military alliance, saying she had played a key role in ensuring the partnership remained “strong and galvanized, as it is today”. The president said he learned of Albright’s death as he traveled to the Belgian capital Brussels last month to meet with European leaders and discuss their ongoing aid to Ukraine. When he delivered remarks in the Polish capital of Warsaw, days later, there was a “deafening cheer” at the mention of Albright’s name, Biden said. “Her name is still synonymous with America as a force for good in the world,” Biden said on Wednesday. “She always had a knack for explaining to the American people why it mattered to them that people everywhere in the world were struggling to breathe free.” As the world now braces for a potentially lengthy and even bloodier war in Ukraine, Biden is counting on that message of shared democratic values to resonate with the American people. Reflecting upon the loss of his former adviser and longtime friend, Bill Clinton lamented that Albright was not here to continue preaching the importance of freedom across the globe. Clinton said he last spoke to Albright two weeks before she died. Brushing aside questions about her failing health, Albright instead wanted to talk about building a better future for the next generation. “What kind of world are we going to leave to our grandchildren? That question’s kind of up in the air. But not because of Madeleine Albright,” Bill Clinton said, adding: “We love you, Madeleine. We miss you, but I pray to God we never stop hearing you. Just sit on our shoulder and nag us to death until we do the right thing.”",News/US news,Presidents eulogize Madeleine Albright at funeral: ‘Freedom had no greater champion’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/27/madeleine-albright-funeral-service
4/28/2022,"Thomas Tuchel accepts Chelsea are in for a “very, very demanding summer” regardless of how the club’s ownership situation plays out, but says he is committed to staying at the club and putting them back on the front foot. It has been nigh-on impossible for Tuchel to make active moves in the transfer market while Chelsea remain up for sale and, even if a deal was concluded imminently, there would be ground to make up in pursuing targets. That is doubly inconvenient given the key defender Antonio Rüdiger has announced he will leave and another centre-back, Andreas Christensen, is also likely to depart. Tuchel was asked, with reference to Ralf Rangnick’s recent remark that Manchester United require “open-heart surgery”, about the kind of work his side must undergo and said he faced a complicated task. “Cosmetic surgery,” he said, with a laugh. “I would be less concerned if we still had the same ownership, if we could rely on our structure. As this is in question we are aware of the danger that the situation is maybe a bit more complex. And it can be complex enough if you lose a player like Toni, and maybe lose another like Andreas, both of them free. It is demanding nowadays in football to lose this kind of quality, even if everything else stays in place. So with this in question it can be a very, very demanding summer.” Tuchel, whose side face United on Thursday and hope for Chelsea’s first win at Old Trafford since May 2013, admitted he was behind schedule in lining up recruits for next season. “You’re never fully sure, but we would have some targets and we would for sure have contacted some players and found out about their situations,” he said. “Now our hands are tied: we can still have the talks inside the building but we cannot act. “The situation is not ideal. It would be challenging enough with a stable situation. We don’t have that so everyone is doing it for the first time. And we try to show our commitment, our passion, for it and maybe it is very important for me to give this message: I’m committed, I’m looking forward to it and I’m passionate about it. And as soon as we can act we will try to turn things around and make it, from a disadvantage, maybe an advantage.” Rüdiger and Reece James have returned to training before the visit to United, where Tuchel will face an old mentor in Rangnick, and Chelsea hope Christensen will have recovered from a sickness issue. All three players missed Sunday’s win over West Ham.",Sport/Football,Tuchel commits his future to Chelsea but says club face demanding summer,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/27/thomas-tuchel-commits-his-future-to-chelsea-but-says-club-face-demanding-summer
4/28/2022,"Ralf Rangnick has admitted that if Manchester United fail to qualify for Europe this could be an advantage for Erik ten Hag in his first season as manager. United are sixth, five points ahead of Wolves, who have a game in hand and are eighth – almost certainly the highest position United would have to finish in for there to be no continental competition next season. Rangnick was asked whether there could be any advantage for Ten Hag should this occur. “It could be an advantage but that does not mean we will give away any of the remaining four games,” the interim manager said. “For us it’s clear and our obligation. This is our job, my job, the job of the players that we try to get the best possible results and then see at the end of the season in which position we will finish. “Now to speak about if that would be an advantage or not does not make sense because if I did that then this would be interpreted again. For me it’s important we get results, that we play as good as we possibly can, because this will also affect the atmosphere and mood for the new season.” United host Chelsea on Thursday with six players ruled out and Aaron Wan-Bissaka a doubt. “Fred is unfortunately not yet available,” Rangnick said. “He tried to train yesterday [on Tuesday] and afterwards I had a conversation with him and with a player like Fred it doesn’t make sense with a muscular injury to play him too early as we would take the risk of re-injury. “Apart from that, Harry Magure is not available; he has some issues with his knee – a niggle. He didn’t train yesterday and today. Paul [Pogba] obviously still out, Luke Shaw still, Jadon [Sancho] is ill – he has had tonsillitis since yesterday, couldn’t train today and won’t be available tomorrow. Edinson Cavani should be back in training on Friday.” Rangnick said he had 14 senior players available and that three or four younger players would be part of the squad. Hannibal Mejbri, Alejandro Garnacho and Álvaro Fernández are expected to be included. Rangnick stated he would definitely continue at the club next year as a consultant. “Yeah I will be,” he said. “I’m looking forward to working in that advisory role and obviously helping Erik as much as he wants it himself. So far we haven’t been able to speak with each other and we have had no contact. “He has his focus on Ajax, I have my focus on Manchester United here. Obviously I’m more than willing and prepared to help both Erik and whomever in the club in order to change everything for the better.”",Sport/Football,"Manchester United not being in Europe may help Ten Hag, says Ralf Rangnick",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/27/manchester-united-not-being-in-europe-may-help-ten-hag-says-ralf-rangnick
4/28/2022,"It is one thing to be the red-hot favourites; another to make it count. Liverpool took a significant stride towards their 10th European Cup final on a night when they refused to lose sight of their plan, what has got them to the point where an unprecedented quadruple is a possibility. Villarreal came to frustrate. It is an approach that had worked in the previous rounds, helping them to stage stunning heists that got them past Juventus and Bayern Munich. With the scoreline blank at the interval, Unai Emery had to feel that he was a part of the way to further plunder. Liverpool stayed cool. They continued to press on to the front foot, to manipulate the ball, only with more pace, more feeling. And they blew the doors off with two blasts in quick succession, the first when a Jordan Henderson cross deflected off the unfortunate Pervis Estupiñán to float into the far corner. Villarreal were reeling and they were floored when Sadio Mané raced on to a Mohamed Salah ball to beat Gerónimo Rulli. The visitors did not threaten at any point and it is difficult to see how they will be able to turn things around in the second leg next Tuesday. The banners had fluttered in the Kop before kick-off, reminding everybody why Liverpool are European royalty and highlighting how this was one of the great David versus Goliath stories at this stage of the competition. Villarreal did not play top-flight football in Spain until 1998-99 and they have won only one major trophy – the Europa League last season. The population of their town is 50,000; in other words, less than the capacity of Anfield. This Liverpool team carry a fear factor and their pre-match calling card featured one devastating statistic. Since 2 January, they had dropped only one result that mattered – in the 2-2 Premier League draw at Manchester City. Villarreal were compact in their 4-4-2 system. They were always going to be. It was the game of their lives and full-blooded commitment was the minimum requirement from Unai Emery, who previously had only bad memories of this stadium. During his spell at Arsenal, he had been here three times and lost all three. Liverpool wanted to bring their usual aggression, with and without the ball, and it was a little worrying for them when Rulli took his time over the first goal-kick of the tie. With two minutes on the clock. The Kop howled. Rulli would go through the same routine whenever he could while his teammates were pretty quick to go down and slow to get up. It was all about fracturing Liverpool’s rhythm. Jürgen Klopp’s team had to show patience after the early goal did not materialise. It might have done. Mané had failed to control after Ibrahima Konaté headed down from a corner – the ball came to the forward quickly – but the big chance of the first quarter came when Salah collected a Mané pass up the right and looked up. Mané made his move, Salah’s cross was perfect but the header was all wrong. Villarreal showed composure on the ball in the first half; they played out intelligently, which is no easy task in the face of the Liverpool press. They were caught at times but there was never any sense of panic as they ticked off the minutes to half-time. Emery’s team barely crossed halfway before the break but it was about the blocks and the tackles, maintaining the shape. Liverpool did have other flickers. Salah curled off target, Mané spun and saw a shot deflect wide while Salah lifted a volley high. He had been picked out by Trent Alexander-Arnold’s sumptuous volleyed cut-back following an Andy Robertson diagonal. Thiago Alcântara also rattled the upright from 30 yards. Villarreal are spiritually bound to Liverpool as a city. Their Yellow Submarine nickname derives from the colour of their shirts and the tune by Liverpool’s most famous band. The Beatles released it in 1966 and, in the 1967-68 season, a band of Villarreal fans started to play it at their club’s games on a battery-powered record player. The Anfield crowd did not feel much of a connection but football is a game of styles and Liverpool had to overcome this one. They found a way in the second half. Fabinho had seen a goal ruled out following a corner, Virgil van Dijk having headed to him from an offside position, and there was good luck about the breakthrough goal. Liverpool will argue that they drove it themselves after a left to right move saw Henderson swap passes with Alexander-Arnold and work the first real overlap of the night. His cross flicked off Estupiñán and sailed over Rulli. Mané’s finish was lethal, unloaded quickly under pressure after Villarreal had allowed Salah to turn – their first real error – and, at the point, it felt over, Liverpool sensing blood and a killer third goal. It did not come, despite the best efforts of Andy Robertson, Van Dijk and Luis Díaz. Two felt like enough.",Sport/Football,Mané helps to give dominant Liverpool first-leg advantage over Villarreal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/27/liverpool-villarreal-champions-league-semi-final-first-leg-match-report
4/28/2022,"Britain is pressing with its allies for Vladimir Putin to be so weakened militarily by the war in Ukraine that he can never pose a threat to European security and his forces to entirely leave Ukraine’s territory, with the country reverting to its pre-2014 borders. The G7 group of industrialised nations is also examining whether it could reimpose the current punitive economic sanctions if Russia tries to renege on the hypothetical future peace deal imposed by western allies. Britain has long said the war must end with Putin being seen to fail, but the containment terms being proposed by western officials include a permanent weakening of the Russian military forces so they can no longer pose a threat to eastern Europe, as well as Russia pulling out of all territory it has occupied, including Crimea, which it annexed in 2014. Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, this week in Germany hinted at the thinking by saying the US wanted the war to end with Russia so weakened it could not repeat its attack on Ukraine. There has been speculation that Ukraine would settle for a return to the pre-invasion status quo where territory was ceded to de facto Russian-backed separatists. On Wednesday night, Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, indicated British thinking on settlement terms in her Lord Mayor’s Banquet speech, saying: “We are doubling down. We are going to keep going further and faster to push Russia out of the whole of Ukraine.” She also warned Putin – who she described in her speech as “a desperate rogue operator with no interest in international mores” – that the west will come to the defence of Moldova in the same way as it is defending Ukraine if Russia mounts an attack there, as seems possible. She said the UK was digging deep into its inventories, including heavy weapons, tanks and aeroplanes, to defend Ukraine and other countries threatened by Russia. She also said future Russian access to the global economy “will depend on playing by the rules. There can be no more free passes”. British thinking reflects a growing confidence that the political, economic and military forces ranged against Putin can, in the long term, lead to his complete defeat. London also detects a change of mood in Washington – and to a lesser extent, Berlin – including a greater willingness to supply weaponry to Nato standards rather than hand-downs from old Warsaw Pact armoury. Britain envisages the security guarantees to Kyiv would largely consist of a commitment to arm Ukraine enough that Russia would not mount an attack. Britain does not favour a Nato-style commitment that Ukraine’s allies would intervene to protect Ukraine if it was threatened by Russia. Critics will say very tough settlement demands run the risk of forcing Putin into a corner so that he threatens the use of tactical weapons. But the Russian leader has already threatened to use nuclear weapons if red lines were crossed. In her speech, Truss also set out a warning to China claiming its rise will not be inevitable if it ignores the rules. Explaining that China is not impervious to western economic pressure, she said China needs to trade with the G7 since it represents around half of the global economy.",News/World news,UK leading G7 allies to weaken Putin’s military arsenal,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/27/uk-leading-g7-allies-to-weaken-putins-military-arsenal
