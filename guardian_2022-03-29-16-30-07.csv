3/29/2022,"Being told you have cancer is one of the biggest shocks you can go through. The coronavirus pandemic and cancer are a nasty combination. All the normal support, even if it’s just a big hug, is something you need but are deprived of. But the main thing is catching breast cancer early and I was lucky enough to do that. We have had it drummed into us that we should “CoppaFeel”, so that whatever your age or gender you are aware of the symptoms of breast cancer, feel for lumps and look for changes in your breasts. But what happens if none of that applies and you still have cancer? That’s what happened to me. The truth is a routine mammogram saved my life. I had no symptoms whatsoever but because of a mammogram in November last year, doctors discovered my cancer early. This early diagnosis means that I’ll make a full recovery. Sadly there are many women whose cancer will go undetected, or only be detected too late. The charity Breast Cancer Now estimates that about one million women in the UK missed appointments for mammogram screenings due to Covid-19. And about 8,600 women could be living with undiagnosed breast cancer after missing out on the screening. The NHS Breast Screening Programme invites all women from the age of 50 to 70 for screening every three years. But all screening was effectively paused in March 2020 because of the pandemic, and now women have sadly fallen through the cracks. Although it’s since resumed, there are big delays as the NHS works through a backlog of people who weren’t able to get an appointment. When breast cancer is only detected at a later stage, it can be harder to treat. I’m deeply concerned about this, and I urge anyone who has symptoms to contact their GP straight away. But also, those of you who do not have symptoms: please don’t leave it too late. Book a routine appointment and get checked now. I would also like to make a specific appeal to other women of colour to please take it up, as we know that uptake of cancer screening is lower among this group. Research by Cancer Research UK and Public Health England found that black women are almost twice as likely to be diagnosed with advanced breast cancer as white women, in part because of lower screening uptake. The incredible NHS doctors, nurses and staff will be there to help, as they were with me. I am telling my story to raise awareness and so that other women can be alert and take up their mammogram whether they have symptoms or not. Hopefully the more we talk about it, the less of a struggle it will be for some people to cope. I’m hoping that by talking about this publicly, I can make a dent in the million women who have missed appointments and help save lives.

3/29/2022,"I am a 30-year-old woman, and I mostly have sex with men (now one man). Over the past year I have gradually found myself more and more averse to certain elements of sex. I still enjoy emotional and physical intimacy with my partner, but feel put off, in particular, by body fluids – his and mine. These things didn’t bother me before – in fact, I enjoyed them – but now I find myself inhibited in the bedroom, and not enjoying sexual encounters (or even thinking about them) as much as I used to. I overcame sexual-assault-related trauma in early adulthood, and have since had an exciting, varied and very enjoyable sex life. I don’t know why this has happened, now, in such a specific, disgust-related way. I would love to explore my full potential for joy, creativity and pleasure again. We are highly complex beings. New aversions, compulsions, obsessions or phobias can develop, as we experience changes in brain chemistry due to precipitating events, such as trauma, extreme fear and overwhelmingly stressful occurrences. Sometimes – on the surface – the specific object, situation or substance seems only distantly related to what caused us to eschew it.

3/29/2022,"Nobody ever beats England. England only ever lose of their own accord, by their own hand, from their own failings. This is doubly true if England are playing a team they generally expect to beat and, from the outbreak of ritual bloodletting that has followed the narrow 1-0 defeat in the recent Test series, West Indies certainly seem to have fallen into that category. Why this might be the case is less easily explained. England have not won a Test series in the Caribbean since 2004. Four members of that touring party were commentating on this series. Three are current members of the backroom setup. Two were recently sacked from that setup. One is now the host of Top Gear. Before that, you have go back to Colin Cowdrey’s side of 1967-68 and an ill-advised declaration by Garfield Sobers in Trinidad. One series win in 54 years. And yet somehow England keep returning to these islands with the same blind optimism, embarking on this assignment with the same baseless expectation, leaving with the same sense of prickled outrage. So Kyle Mayers doesn’t take seven wickets in Grenada. Instead, England throw their wickets away, in the same way that Joshua Da Silva doesn’t hit a match-winning century but simply watches his total increase as a result of England’s bowlers losing the plot. And despite what Jayden Seales, Jason Holder or Alzarri Joseph might tell you, no bowler in the history of cricket has ever dismissed Zak Crawley. Crawley, like James Vince and Jos Buttler before him, only ever gets himself out. Perhaps it should not be overly surprising that England’s latest defeat has inspired another round of gloomy introspection and screaming psychodrama, of grown men on the internet grumbling about pitches and pathways, of ex-pros in the media glowering in funereal tones. “Honestly Butch, this is the worst England team I’ve seen in 40 years of watching cricket.” We got high on this kind of performative indignation during the Ashes, and some of us remain addicted to it. But many of the analyses to have emerged over recent days lapse beyond simple partisanship, into a kind of self-obsession. One series review from a respected English cricket correspondent this week somehow managed to name-check eight of the England side, two players not involved in the series, two former captains (Nasser Hussain and Andrew Strauss) and a former coach (Duncan Fletcher), without mentioning a single West Indian. This is not simply an editorial focus. It’s a worldview, and a particularly shrunken one at that: underpinned by the basic idea that England, even at their lowest ebb against skilled opponents in foreign conditions, should be the sole masters of their own destiny. West Indies, of course, were forced to shake themselves free of that delusion some time ago. For years they have been forced to pick teams not remotely representative of their collective talent, but based solely on who is still available after politics, emigration and franchise Twenty20 have taken their toll. In another world, the likes of Nicholas Pooran, Sherfane Rutherford and Romario Shepherd might have been the backbone of a thriving West Indies Test side. Instead they are all at the Indian Premier League, cut adrift from the national team by the great flood of market forces. That West Indies even have a Test team worthy of the name is an impressive feat in itself; that they can still thrive occasionally – in the past 14 months they have won in Bangladesh and drawn with Sri Lanka and Pakistan – is a testament to their enduring talent and skill, the hunger and selflessness to submit to a common goal in an age when even to play red-ball cricket is often an act of self-denial. This is a team with stars but no celebrities; with journeymen but no passengers; whose limited circumstances have forced them to embrace the very qualities – patience, discipline, culture and long-term vision – that English cricket has so stunningly mislaid. Four years ago Nkrumah Bonner was a construction worker in Houston. Five years ago Da Silva had no professional deal and was playing Surrey league cricket. Veerasammy Permaul grew up without a television and had to sneak out of the house to play soft-ball games in the street. Kraigg Brathwaite has survived for 77 Tests in one of the hardest eras ever to open the batting. When his team are rolled over, it is seen as a sad indictment of the game. When they resist, people moan about dead pitches and boring cricket. The point is not that these people need your love or esteem. The point is that England didn’t simply lose a Test series; West Indies won it. And perhaps a genuine red‑ball reset in this country would involve recognising that England do not have an automatic entitlement to win games of cricket, that losing 1-0 against West Indies need not necessarily be a source of soul-searching and national disgrace, that victorious opponents deserve better than to be cast as extras in a Joe Root captaincy saga. This is an exceptionalism that runs through the blood of English cricket. We saw it in the scandalously late decision to cancel the tour of Pakistan, the reluctance to embrace white-ball innovation in the 2000s and 2010s, the reduction of so many Test series to “Ashes warmup” status. Perhaps, instead of another round of sackings and another wave of self-hatred, what this moment really needs is a little air, a little perspective, a little credit where it’s due.",Sport/Sport,West Indies deserve better than supporting role in England melodrama | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/29/west-indies-deserve-better-than-supporting-role-in-england-melodrama
3/29/2022,"It can be hard to remember what work at the office was like before the pandemic forced millions of Americans to start working from home. That shift was monumental and seemingly implausible, until it happened. But people soon adapted to saying “sorry, you’re on mute” on Zoom calls and wearing sweatpants all day. This spring, workers are finally heading back to the office en masse and into another untested and ambitious experiment in work life: hybrid working. “This is a brave new world – we’re doing something we’ve never done before, which is we’re going to go, en masse, hybrid,” said Nicholas Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford. Many companies that are bringing their workers back to the office are doing so on this basis, meaning they are allowing employees to do a mix of in-person and virtual work during the week. Some workers will be expected to work a set number of days in the office; others will get to choose which days they want to come in. The great experiment is already under way. During the week of 9 March, the average office occupancy rate across 10 large US metro areas was 40.5% – the highest percentage since December, according to Kastle Systems. Companies that once told employees that they would be working from home indefinitely have set dates to return to the office. Microsoft was the first big tech company to announce that it wanted its employees back in the office, by the end of February. Other companies, including Google and Apple, soon followed suit. Twitter, which at the beginning of the pandemic told employees they could work from home “for ever”, said it would reopen its offices in mid-March. But these companies are telling staff that the era of the five-day office week is over. Some of employees’ time can be spent working from home. Whether this new structure of office work will last is unclear, largely because this is the first wide-scale adoption of hybrid work. Bloom, who has studied remote work for nearly two decades, has been consulting with hundreds of companies and managers on their return to office plans. Managers, it seems, want their workers back in the office. A survey from Slack found that executives were three times more likely than non-executive employees to want to return to the office full-time. Employees, on the other hand, want to keep working remotely – at least some of the work week. With today’s tight labor market, Bloom said, the worst thing a company can do is expect workers to come in five days a week. Multiple surveys have shown that workers have liked the perks of working from home so much that many are willing to switch jobs to keep that option. “That is the fastest way to destroy your company,” Bloom said. “Hybrid work-from-home, it’s become completely a standard.” Bloom points out that before the pandemic, many people were already doing some type of hybrid work. “Most of us probably did some work on the weekend, some work in the evenings. So it isn’t actually such a radical shift to say ‘we’re going to formalize this’,” he said. The best hybrid mix right now, according to Bloom, is the “boring and predictable” hybrid model of three days in the office and two days working from home. The number of days in this model are not random. Research has shown that people want to work from home on average 2.5 days a week, making the three-two model the closest compromise. The plans of companies like Citigroup, Apple and Google will allow most workers to follow this model. Other companies, such as Twitter, are leaving it up to employees to work out with their teams how often they will work in the office. Some companies that have been testing hybrid models have noticed that employees seem to appreciate this flexibility. Joanne Wright, vice-president of enterprise operations and services at IBM, said the company had been working on opening its 100 office locations scattered across the country for employees and teams to use as much as they want. “We know that there’s going to be days when they’re going to work from home and continue to be productive, and there’s days where it makes sense for them to be with a team or clients, collaborating and innovating,” Wright said. “We were flexible before the pandemic, and that’s what we’ve been trying to drive in this new world, is maybe we need to even think more flexibility than before.” Management experts stress that return-to-office plans should work toward accommodating balance between employees’ work and non-work lives, and employers need to communicate to their employees that hybrid models are still experimental. Surveys and discussions with employees will be crucial in understanding how return-to-office plans are affecting their lives. “We’ve never actually been in this place before,” said Heidi Brooks, a lecturer at the Yale School of Management. She said employers needed to be especially aware of how the nature of productivity has changed during the pandemic, when people built their work lives outside the office. “The question that’s now up is: can we transition back and hold on to what works … and all of the gains that were possible when people didn’t have to commute and transition [to the office]?” Brooks emphasizes the importance of fairness in return-to-office plans and says executives must consider the pandemic’s “differential impacts”, particularly around race and gender. For example, women with young children have to figure out childcare to go into work. Johnny C Taylor, president and chief executive of the Society for Human Resource Management, said that employers would need to see how return-to-office plans affect morale and a company’s culture, not just worker productivity. “[A plan] may prove to be incredibly effective, but you may not be creating an environment where people enjoy their work and are engaged,” Taylor said. Employers also have to be clear about how return-to-office plans balance the needs of employees and the company. “We have to bring more balance into the discussion that this is good for you, but it also has to be good for us too,” Taylor said, adding that employers needed to be transparent about how they are still figuring out what will work best for the company. “It is important for employers to be honest about the fact that we don’t really know how this is all going to work out.”",News/US news,America is entering the great experiment of hybrid work,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/29/hybrid-work-experiment-post-pandemic
3/29/2022,"When Jamaica’s prime minister, Andrew Holness, announced to Prince William last week that Jamaica was “moving on”, the irony of his statement was lost on most. Visiting the country in 2015, Britain’s then PM, David Cameron, told Jamaican politicians making the case for reparations to “move on”. Republican ideology has been given renewed energy since 2021 when Barbados, led by Mia Mottley, became the latest Caribbean island to remove the Queen as head of state, replacing her with a female president. Mottley had strongly opined that the Caribbean had won political independence but was denied any developmental compact. Outlining the strides the Caribbean had made in reversing legal inequalities, she made the case that only reparations could help tackle the psychological, sociological and economic inequalities that still exist within Caribbean countries and between them and their former colonisers. Reparation seems a dirty word whenever Caribbean leaders utter it, and talks have taken on a farcical narrative. In 1834, reparations of over £20m were paid, not to the slaves but to the plantation owners, in compensation for their loss of free labour after emancipation. Talks over the last 60 years or so, since independence began, have offered no cause for celebration. Britain has been remorseful in words but not emphatic in action. In August 2020, the UK government’s response was: “The UK deplores the human suffering caused by slavery and the slave trade. They are among the most abhorrent chapters in the history of humanity.” Sound familiar? Prince William reiterated this in Jamaica. The statement went on: “While reparations are not part of the government’s approach, we feel deep sorrow for the transatlantic slave trade, and fully recognise the strong sense of injustice and the legacy of slavery in the most affected parts of the world. We also believe that we have much to do today and in the future to address the reality of slavery in the UK and around the world.” But hey, let’s move on! Reparations are not part of our approach and neither is a formal apology or, worse yet, making things economically right. I wonder if William knew he was making his statement on the eve of the International Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade, which passed almost unnoticed on 25 March. The day honours the more than 12 million men, women and children brutalised under a slavery system that endured for more than 400 years. The large population of people of African descent in the Caribbean remains the legacy of the inhuman enforced migration which broke the ladder of generational wealth of these displaced people. In June 2020, the UK prime minister pledged to establish a new commission on ethnic disparities to “examine all aspects of continuing racial and ethnic inequalities in Britain”. This will have no meaningful impact for the ordinary person on the streets of Kingston, Port of Spain or Bridgetown. Voicing “sorrow and regret” is indeed a start but money talks far more than platitudes. One has only to look at how the Windrush generation has been treated to understanding the Caribbean’s plight, how much it has given and how little it has had in return. Today, black and minority ethnic (BME) politics seems to be only about scholarships for black students to British universities and, in the workplace, painting the diversity picture and checking that box. Admittedly, this is important and a step in the right direction, but not enough. Former British colonies should not be treated like the French have treated Haiti. In 1791, after the world’s largest slave revolt, Haiti became the first nation to dismantle slavery. However, it was held to political ransom, forced to succumb to France’s reparation demands in order to secure independence in 1804. The terms were cruel, as the infant nation entered into debt with exorbitant interest rates imposed by the French. Haiti paid French slaveholders and their descendants the equivalent today of $30bn, taking 122 years to pay it off, and severely damaging the newly independent country’s ability to prosper. Citizens of Belize and Jamaica protested during the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s visit. A petition proclaimed that there was absolutely nothing to rejoice over for the last 70 years of the Queen’s role in Jamaica. As part of the Queen’s platinum jubilee, other tours are planned. In April, Edward and Sophie, the Earl and Countess of Wessex, will travel to Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, St Lucia, and St Vincent and the Grenadines. Some of the last significant bastions of the British empire lie in Caribbean waters. These tiny island paradises, thousands of miles away yet still tied to the British empire, have been plagued by natural disasters which have impacted infrastructure and economies. Two years of the pandemic have severed any hope of a quick recovery. In addition, there is political corruption by captured states, and the inertia of successive governments that seem hellbent on destroying their economies and enriching themselves, moving their ill-gotten gains through British tax-haven territories, with the final destination being London, to be hidden in real estate and other investments. Caribbean politicians and officials continue to be naive towards what reparations would mean to Britain. They fool themselves that they possess leverage if they remain in the Commonwealth. Maybe a clue lies in recent articles and interviews on reparation issues between Namibia and its German ex-colonisers, which reveal exactly how the west views reparations. Namibia was known as “German South West Africa” from 1884 to 1915. Between 1904 and 1908, German colonial forces brutally suppressed anti-colonial uprisings by the Herero and Nama people, forcing many into the desert to starve. They killed tens of thousands, confiscating land and livestock. In 1988, the South African government finally agreed to give up control of Namibia and it was granted independence in 1990. The German government has acknowledged responsibility for genocide in Namibia but “reparation” is feared as a legal term by German negotiators concerned at setting any expensive precedent. Reparations therefore become masked as “developmental aid”, suggesting a handout, and a means by which the west can appear as saviours. It is not restorative justice. Reparations to bring real, impactful development initiatives in infrastructure, education, health and transportation could change the destiny of the descendants of slavery in the Caribbean. The fight for reparations must continue and must unite the ethnic majority of the Americas, the Caribbean and Africa. In addition, the Caribbean countries, having taken their destiny into their own hands, must break the chains of political corruption and corporate capture which continue to smother and retard their economic and social development.
