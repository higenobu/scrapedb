3/26/2022,"Despite all the restrictions and uncertainty caused by the pandemic, Croatia’s tourism industry made a decent show of bouncing back last year – to about two-thirds of its 2019 levels. And the perennial hotspots of Dubrovnik, Hvar, Brač and Korčula have been as popular as ever. But while millions of people spent last year beating a well-trodden path, there are still regions, islands and beaches where the tourist footprint is lighter, the crowds fewer and the atmosphere more mellow. If you’re looking for an escape and a new discovery this year – but not the crowds – you’ll find it in these places. There’s a pleasingly laid-back feel to this small town on the Adriatic’s Šibenik Riviera, north-east of Split. The new D-Marin marina hasn’t really affected the slow pace of life in this part of northern Dalmatia, but has added a pleasant hum to the harbour-front cafes. At the mouth of the harbour is Tribunj’s tiny old town, on an islet connected to the coast by a stone bridge. At one tumultuous point in its history, the town’s population crammed into its fortified castle to protect itself from Ottoman attacks. Ringed by moored boats, the compact islet is home to no fewer than nine bars and restaurants, and is the place to be on a balmy summer evening. A waterside table at the convivial Konoba Dida Toni is a great place to savour a platter of grilled fish or slow-cooked octopus. The town’s indented coastline harbours several pebbly and rocky beaches, including pine-backed Zamalin just the other side of the stubby Saint Nicholas peninsula. Saint Nicholas church, the town’s emblem, sits on top of the hill, and beyond a bigger peninsula further west is beautifully wild but sheltered Sovlje beach. East of the marina is Tribunj’s main beach, Bristak, with sun loungers and jetskis for hire. Those who prefer more strenuous activities can rent a bike (details from the tourist office) and tackle one of the cycling trails that lead through olive groves and up towards spectacular views of the Adriatic. The hiking is just as good, with paths leading to an old Turkish fort and hillside chapels. With the Adriatic surrounding the town, it’s not surprising that Tribunj likes to celebrate its seafood. The summer season kicks off in mid-June, with a giant Fishermen’s Night feast, a traditional Croatian festival. In late July and late August there are more seafood festivals, as well as a rather comical annual donkey race on the first Sunday in August. Where to stayPlavi Val (from €40 a night for two) has five apartments overlooking Sovlje beach. They each come with a double bedroom, a sofa bed and a terrace, and there’s a restaurant of the same name on the ground floor. The forested peaks of Papuk nature park in Slavonia – the rectangular eastern region of Croatia bordered by Hungary, Serbia and Bosnia – were once an island in the ancient Pannonian Sea, and now sit in the middle of the vast Pannonian plain, which stretches from the Alps to the Carpathians. For an exhilarating introduction to this Unesco geopark start at its heart, in the Jankovac forest park. Educational trails wind through centuries-old beech woods, along raised wooden walkways, past lakes and towards the 35-metre-high Skakavac waterfall. At the Jankovac visitors’ centre, there are canoes to hire for a gentle paddle on Jankovac lake, or bikes for a scoot along the park’s hiking and biking trails. Bicycles are also available at the main ticket office in the village of Velika, on the southern edge of the park. Just south of Jankovac is Duboka Adrenaline Park, with a zipline and climbing trails for children and adults. The Adriatic is miles away, but there are waterside views on the park’s north-eastern edge, towards the village of Orahovica, where the ruins of medieval Ružica castle tower over the blue-green waters of Hercegovac lake. For swimming, there’s the human-made Orahovačko lake, where there’s also a children’s play area and bike park. Where to stayB&B Winery Sontacchi (doubles from £50, on booking.com) in the village of Kutjevo, just south of the nature park, offers simple en suite rooms, a small spa pool and a garden. It’s one of a fair number of wineries in the village and its surrounding area, so there is plenty of opportunity for tastings. Galić Winery, just 500 metres up the road from Sontacchi, produces one of the loveliest rosés in Croatia. With no cars, motorbikes or hotels, Silba certainly qualifies for the overused “unspoilt” tag. This small, mainly flat island (the highest point is 80 metres above sea level) in the Zadar archipelago is as relaxed as they come. It’s only five miles long and barely half a mile wide at its narrowest point, which happens to be where Silba town stretches from east to west. It is the perfect place to kick back and relax on the beach, swim, eat fresh seafood and perhaps go hiking along rocky paths through oak woods. Parts of the island are served by footpaths smooth enough to double as cycling trails. Silba may be small but it packs in plenty of beaches. Pernastica on the north coast has vivid turquoise waters that are worth the hour’s trek through woods. At the other end of the scale, Sotorišće is right by the town centre, and may get a little busy in high season. For water-borne exploring, Rent a Boat Silba in Silba town hires out canoes, paddleboards and – for those with a licence – small motorised boats and dinghies. It also offers a boat taxi service and private tours. Even slower-paced is Silba’s neighbour Olib, where cars are also banned. Boat services also run from Silba to another tiny neighbour, Premuda, as well as Lošinj in the Kvarner Gulf. Zadar is only about 90 minutes away on the fast catamaran. Where to staySilbaBlu Bed and Breakfast (sleeps two from £39) has one-bedroom apartments with kitchens, balconies and sea views on Silba Town’s western beachfront. The shared garden includes a barbecue, and there’s a minimum five-night stay. The famous waterfalls and lakes of Plitvice Lakes national park get very busy, but a 90-minute drive north, no fewer than 93 waterfalls ripple along the Mrežnica River. Its clear waters meander through gorgeous karst landscape for 39 miles from Slunj towards Karlovac. It offers tranquil swimming spots, riverside restaurants and campsites, wooded islands and a huge number of places to go rafting and kayaking. Mrežnica’s waterfalls are on a smaller, more human scale, making them safer to navigate and swim in. Closer to Plitvice is the tiny village of Primišlje, from where Huck Finn Adventure runs one-day kayak and rafting tours of the river. Guests get to jump from the river’s second-highest waterfall, stop for waterside picnics and swim from secluded beaches. Where to stayCamp Slapić (cabin for two from £38) offers simple wooden “tents” right on the river, with decks and tables from which to enjoy the view. About a 20-minute drive from Karlovac, the site also has tent pitches and mobile homes as well as a pool, a children’s playground and a restaurant. Just 90 minutes’ drive north of Dubrovnik is a world completely different from Croatia’s most-visited tourist destination. Beyond Bosnia’s narrow slice of the Adriatic coast lies the patchwork of orchards, lakes, bird-rich wetlands and waterways that makes up the Neretva delta and valley. (Sometime this summer it should be possible to avoid customs queues when the new Pelješac Bridge opens, linking two swaths of the Croatian coast that are currently split by a small stretch of Bosnia and Herzegovina, shaving a fair bit of time off the journey.) A few miles past the border is Blace, a village on a small bay wedged in between the Mala Neretva river and the Adriatic. Here, the Chill Beach Bar, on a sandy spit, is the place for a cold drink and a game of beach volleyball. A short way north across a bridge is sandy Delta Beach, where kitesurfing lessons are offered by Neretva Kiteboarding. The road inland towards the Bosnian border follows the Neretva river as it winds past fruit stalls selling produce grown in these valley fields. Close to the border is the ancient market town of Metković, where Neretva Bike rents out cycles. Places nearby to explore on two wheels include the village of Vid, whose Narona Archaeological Museum displays ancient Roman and Illyrian finds. But the most satisfying and often the only way to get to know this delta region is on a boat. Many of the rural restaurants offer boat safaris that meander through the waterways and lakes – including one of the most beautiful, Lake Kuti, with herons, cormorants and hoopoes to spot. Where to stayMidway between Opuzen – another appealing stop along the Neretva – and Metković is Hotel Restaurant Villa Neretva (doubles from £38 B&B). The hotel also offers boat safaris and trips to Lake Kuti as well as boat trips to its sister restaurant, Konoba Neretvanska Kuća, in a peaceful waterside spot a few miles south. Croatia’s newest nature park, Dinara is home to Croatia’s highest mountain (the 1,831-metre Planina Dinara) and some fantastic hiking. This massif actually has an even higher peak, the Troglav, but that’s just across the border in Bosnia. This vast karst landscape in the northern Dalmatia hinterland is smothered in wild flowers in spring and summer. Eagles and griffon vultures soar overhead, and herds of goats munch on sweet summer grass. A trek to the top of Dinara is best done with a local guide– they can be booked at Dinaric Guides, in the town of Sinj, to the south of the nature park. There are several mountain huts to overnight in for those planning a multi-day hike, as well as some easier, shorter trails that can be completed in a few hours. The city of Knin is another starting point for hikes, and for gentler walks to the Krčić waterfall on the Krka river and swims in Šarena lake. Knin was the royal capital of Croatia in the Middle Ages, and its forbidding fortress, which dates from the ninth century and is the second largest in Croatia, is worth a visit. One of the park’s most extraordinary sights is the source of the Cetina river, which eventually flows into the Adriatic at Omiš . It’s easy to see why this beauty spot is called the eye of Dalmatia: the centre of the deep pool is deep blue, with its shallower edges bright turquoise. It’s surrounded by scrubby limestone slopes and overlooked by a neo-Byzantine Serbian Orthodox church. The source’s temperature never rises above 8C, and while fans of cold-water swimming might be tempted to dive in, it’s not recommended. Where to stayApartments Budiša (sleeps two from £41) is in the village of Vrlika overlooking Peruća Lake, a tranquil spot about eight miles south of the Cetina spring. About 18 miles inland from Zadar, on the Dalmatian coast, is Karinsko More, an inland sea connected to the Adriatic by a narrow channel. Anyone who has tried bungee jumping off the Maslenica Bridge, which spans that channel, will have spotted this beach-fringed body of water, with the smaller Karin sea off to its south, and the Zrmanja river canyon on its northern side. Around it, a sleepy collection of small waterside villages – including Maslenica, Posedarje, Pridraga and Kruševo – are interspersed with pebbly and rocky beaches. It is a dream spot for kayakers, who can paddle from beach to beach in these protected waters before setting off into the Zrmanja canyon – all against the backdrop of the Velebit mountains. On Karinsko More’s southern shore, at the foot of a zigzagging bay, is the historic town of Novigrad, whose hulking hilltop medieval fortress, reached by many stone steps,offers superb views. The town is a handy base for bike rides along trails stretching for 20 miles, and lunches of local mussels at Konoba Mika on the waterfront. The mussels are so highly regarded that they get their own festival every June. And the first Saturday in August brings another fish feast, when the town’s fishermen cook their catches in the harbour. Zrmanja River Tours, based in Novigrad, organises activities including group rafting adventures in Zrmanja canyon as well as more sedate boat safaris along the river. There are kayaks, canoes and rafts to hire for independent trips, or private excursions on a small skippered boat. Where to stayApartments Mali Dvor (sleep four from £33, on booking.com) are near the mouth of the Z-shaped bay that leads to Novigrad. There are two flats to choose from, both with two bedrooms and a balcony, and there’s a shared garden with a barbecue and sea views.

3/26/2022,"The Biden administration is facing a delicate balancing act between relaxing US Covid-19 precautions during the current lull in case numbers in the US and conveying the urgency of the possible next surge, experts say. Cases and hospitalizations have fallen sharply in recent weeks. The US is nearing the lowest Covid hospitalization rate of the entire pandemic, and case numbers are now at the lowest they have been in eight months, since July 2021. Precautions such as mask mandates and proof of vaccination requirements have dropped in many of the states and cities that instituted them. But thousands of Americans are still dying every week, and the recent spike in Europe has officials watching for a possible surge, either from the new Omicron sublineage BA.2 or another variant. The US has typically followed UK surges by a few weeks. It’s difficult to understand how much of Europe’s wave can be attributed to relaxed precautions, waning immunity or intrinsic properties of BA.2, like its increased transmissibility. But many of these countries have higher vaccination rates, especially higher booster rates in older adults, than the US. “We’re playing with infectious disease fire right now,” said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. The US has not reached the endemic phase yet, but even endemic viruses need careful management and steady funding, said Gregg Gonsalves, an epidemiologist at Yale School of Public Health. “We spend billions of dollars to keep things modestly in check. We’re not even doing that” with Covid. Officials have discussed what actions to take if cases in the US begin to tick back up – including recommending masks, distributing tests, strengthening hospital capacity, and improving vaccination rates. The administration’s plan for moving forward, unveiled in early March, included protecting against and treating Covid cases, preparing for new variants, keeping the economy and schools open, and vaccinating the world. But actions like these could be hampered by lack of funding, which risks undoing the progress the US has made. “We will see, within the next month, really severe challenges with regards to funding for vaccines, drugs, and testing, and that’s going to be a real challenge if we don’t get this funding,” Osterholm said. Congress unexpectedly cut $15bn in pandemic funds from an omnibus spending bill earlier this month. The funds for testing and treating uninsured patients already expired on Tuesday, which could be a significant roadblock in suppressing a surge from BA.2 or another variant. Widespread domestic testing could end by June, the White House said in a memo on the sweeping effects of funding shortfalls. Money for booster shots and treatments is expected to run out by the end of the month. The US has been unable to complete the purchases of more monoclonal antibody treatments planned for 25 March and preventive treatments for the immune-compromised planned for 30 March. Purchases of the antiviral treatment Paxlovid may also be halted. Pfizer plans to deliver 10m courses of Paxlovid, its highly effective antiviral treatment, by the end of June, with another 10m before the end of the year. So far, however, only 1m doses of the treatment have been allocated to states. Treatments represent an important turning point of managing the pandemic, and they are a core element of the administration’s “test to treat” strategy, where those at high risk of severe illness or death are prescribed medications immediately for free. Because treatments like these take months to manufacture, falling behind on purchasing deadlines means there could be shortages through the end of the year. Even the $22.5bn the White House requested may have been too low to address the fallout of the pandemic. US Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi recommended that the White House double its request to $54bn. The efforts to prepare for the next wave could also be undermined by recent actions from the administration, including changes to the CDC’s community risk guidelines that seem more driven by politics than public health. “That did not come from public health recommendations; that came from governors reading the tea leaves saying the public is tired of this,” Osterholm said. Democrats were advised to “take credit” for ending the crisis phase of the pandemic because Americans are tired of restrictions, according to a memo from the polling firm Joe Biden used in 2020. Politicians and officials feel a “political imperative,” Gonsalves said, to “take the win” in order to sway voters in the midterm elections. This relaxed approach to the pandemic is “not laissez-faire, it’s basically surrender – and I think we’re in trouble,” Gonsalves said. “The pandemic is not over, the virus is not over, and I think we’re doing policy based on wishful thinking and policy paralysis born of fear and cowardice.” As a result, the American public’s assessment of risk has been distorted, Gonsalves said. “If we see another surge that increases hospitalizations and deaths in the next few weeks, we’re not going to be prepared.” Incoming coronavirus response coordinator Ashish Jha wrote recently that “relying entirely on cases to dictate risk no longer makes sense,” urging instead a shift to hospitalizations. But other public health experts worry that by the time hospitalizations have increased, rising infections will be much harder to control. Physicians are warning that health systems are not strong enough to contend with surges every few months. “It’s not a sustainable future,” Gonsalves said. If cases, hospitalizations, and deaths start to increase again, “we need to be ready, if necessary, to pivot back” to taking precautions like wearing masks, Anthony Fauci, the president’s chief medical adviser, said recently, adding that “if we want to continue this, as I call it, tiptoeing back to normality, we want to make sure that we do everything within our power to prevent the kinds of things that will set us back.” The pandemic is not like a sporting event with a beginning, middle, and end, Osterholm said. “What we haven’t done is help the public understand that this is a continuum – there isn’t a start and a stop with this right now.” It’s more like the weather, he said. “It never ends, it’s just some days are better than others.” Above all, officials need to stay flexible and understand that the virus will continue to evolve and surge, experts said. “Be careful how you describe the end of the pandemic, because we may be a ways from it from actually occurring,” Osterholm said. “What we’re learning about this virus every day is very humbling.”",News/World news,"As Covid precautions fall away across US, some experts advise against ‘wishful thinking’",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/26/covid-precautions-fall-away-experts-advise-against-wishful-thinking
3/26/2022,"Genetically modified male mosquitoes may soon be buzzing across areas of California, in an experiment to stop the spread of invasive species in a warming climate. Earlier this month, the EPA cleared the UK-based biotech company Oxitec to release a maximum of roughly 2.4bn of its genetically modified mosquitoes through 2024, expand its existing trial in Florida and start a new pilot project in California’s Central Valley, where mosquito numbers are on the rise. Oxitec’s modified mosquitoes are male, and therefore don’t bite. They were developed with a special protein so that when they pair with a female mosquito the only viable offspring they produce are also non-biting males. The project specifically targets the Aedes aegypti mosquito, one of more than 3,500 mosquito species and a dangerous invasive insect that has spread diseases like dengue, Zika, Chikungunya, and yellow fever in other countries. The company hopes that releasing its engineered bugs will help control the Aedes aegypti in California, where numbers have risen in recent years. The species is already on the move across the state, and has been found in 21 counties according to the California department of public health. The state’s devastating drought conditions – with low water levels in pipes and ponds, slowed stagnating streams, and less rain to flush out water systems – have helped mosquito populations flourish, and they love to lurk near houses and communities. The dangerous diseases aren’t yet spreading in California, but the invasive insect has been highlighted by officials as a growing risk. “It does not belong here and it is environmentally disruptive,” said Rajeev Vaidyanathan, irector of US programs at Oxitec, of the Aedes aegypti. He added that female Aedes aegypti prefer to feed and breed in and around people’s homes, and are out biting during the day – making them much more difficult to eradicate with pesticides. “Butterflies and bees are out during the day,” Vaidyanathan said. “That makes it very incompatible with traditional mosquito control.” The company’s so-called “friendly” male mosquitoes are delivered as eggs, ready to deploy in a “just-add-water” device, which could help curb the high cost typically associated with eradicating the species. The project, which will be carried out in partnership with the Delta Mosquito and Vector Control district in Tulare county, still needs to be reviewed by California’s department of pesticide regulation. But Oxitec has already introduced this particular strain of genetically modified mosquitoes in Brazil and is fresh from a first-year trial in the Florida Keys. The company claims to have encouraging results. “Every single larva that carried our gene emerged as an adult male,” Vaidyanathan said. “We didn’t have any female emergence.” Oxitec is now eager to test the technology in a new and changing climate. “There are some fundamental questions we need to answer before we can say this is a viable tool for mosquito control,” Vaidyanathan said. “How is that going to affect our boys’ ability to fly? How is it going to affect our boys’ ability to mate?” he said, noting that the Central Valley is a “goldilocks” test location due to its arid agricultural landscapes with temperatures that climb past 100F during the summer. “We cannot extrapolate with what we have done in Florida.” The EPA earlier this month concluded that the test was safe to humans and the environment, but stipulated that the mosquitoes cannot be released near any potential tetracycline sources, an antibiotic that acts as an antidote. The regulations include within 500 meters of wastewater treatment facilities, commercial citrus, apple, pear, nectarine, peach growing areas, or commercial cattle, poultry and pig livestock producers. All the modified insects are equipped with a marker gene that scientists can use to tell them apart from wild ones and regular monitoring will be put in place to ensure the experiment is going to plan. Still, the pilot has encountered some resistance. Citing concerns about possibly unforeseen consequences and a lack of transparency, critics are calling on California regulators to pull the plug. “The science was incomplete before the first rollout,” said Dana Perls, the food and technology program manager with Friends of the Earth of the trial in Florida. She said California and Florida should not be taking risks with experimental biotechnology, and said a lack of publicly released data from the field trials in Florida made it hard to gauge the project’s success. Close to 13,000 comments were issued to the EPA in opposition to the project’s expansion this year, the bulk of them signatures collected by the advocacy organizations Friends of the Earth, the Institute for Responsible Tech and the Center for Food Safety. “There’s no such thing as 100% effective in science,” Perls said. “Yet the public is being asked to trust that Oxitec’s experiment will work and no GE female mosquitoes will survive. But how do we know that?” Opponents have also raised questions about the modified mosquitoes’ interaction with Tetracycline, an antibiotic used in agriculture, which can be found in wastewater and works as an antidote, enabling female mosquitoes to develop. They fear the complicated interplay could lead to hybrid mosquitoes that are even more difficult to control. “That’s why there needs to be transparency. We need unbiased independent review, transparency and public participation,” Perls said. Vaidyanathan said the data has been reviewed by regulators and that company officials had presented findings at conferences across the country. There are plans to release the data to the public after the regulatory process at the federal and state level concludes. “We are following the EPA’s strict guidelines,” he said. “Once we get the permits,” he added, “we can talk about it publicly.”",News/Environment,US poised to release 2.4bn genetically modified male mosquitoes to battle deadly diseases,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/26/us-release-genetically-modified-mosquitoes-diseases
3/26/2022,"“Idon’t really believe in evil, as such,” says Bertie Carvel. “I think there are evil actions. Evil stuff happens, and people cause it. But I don’t believe in good people and bad people. I think people are a composite of their character’s circumstances or decisions. And your job as an actor is to sort of … walk in those shoes.” Carvel seems attracted to a certain moral murkiness. His résumé includes roles as Rupert Murdoch in James Graham’s play Ink; Miss Trunchbull, the monstrous headmistress in Roald Dahl’s Matilda the Musical, whom he played on stage in both London and New York; and Simon Foster, the sociopathic, financially reckless love rat from BBC One’s Doctor Foster. In the past, he has said that he likes portraying questionable characters and having “a damn good try making you like them”. His interest in politics and power led to him portraying that Faustian antihero Nick Clegg in the Channel 4 drama Coalition; he is about to play Tony Blair in The Crown. But on the morning we meet, he is deep into rehearsals for a role that fuses politics with ethics – or the lack of them – and marks his most daring career move to date. Carvel’s portrayal of Donald Trump is at the heart of a new play titled The 47th – as in the 47th president of the United States, the shorthand Trump is already using for his imagined victory over Joe Biden (number 46) in the US election that will take place in 2024. Written by Doctor Foster’s creator, Mike Bartlett, and staged at London’s Old Vic, it is an inventive imagining of the buildup to that contest – which puts Trump at the centre of a cast of characters that also includes Biden, his vice-president, Kamala Harris, and Trump’s elder children Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr – against a backdrop of the kind of civil unrest that broke out when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building on 6 January 2021. As with Bartlett’s play King Charles III, about the arrival on the throne of the next monarch, most of the script for The 47th is written in iambic pentameter. The device is imposed on Trump’s singular style of speech to wondrously comic effect. But the play also has a serious, frequently terrifying undertow – because however absurd its principal character’s antics are, everything feels as if it could actually happen. “I get a chill reading this script because it’s completely credible,” says Carvel. “It’s so hard to write Trump because he does stuff you literally can’t make up.” It is, I suggest, quite a role to tackle. Even taking into account the baddies Carvel has played in the past, he may initially face a wall of unprecedented loathing. “Well, I don’t think it’s that different,” he says. “You’re right: people will come to it with a predisposition to think certain things about him. But a big part of theatre is meeting people’s expectations and challenging them. Not necessarily because you want to change people’s minds, but as an advocate for the character, you’ve got to say: ‘Look at me as a human being.’ That could include megalomania, narcissism or sadism. But you have to present someone who is complete. Coherent.” I have been sent a work-in-progress version of the script, and within 10 minutes of starting it, I got a sharp sense of what Bartlett and Carvel want to dig into. Underneath this Trump’s bombast and nastiness, there is someone isolated, scared and endlessly in need of validation. “You don’t have a single friend,” Harris tells him at one point. “Your wife lives separately, your kids despise / Your guts, and so you need a place to go / Where you can simply talk / The lonely loser hates the world and so / Resentful, turns his tantrums on us all.” “That’s someone psychoanalysing him, so it’s not necessarily the truth of the character,” says Carvel. “But it’s triggering for him to hear that stuff, I think. Loneliness is there. Mortality is a big theme. There’s a sense of being motivated by his legacy. And audience is a big subject. Who are they, and what is his relationship with them?” What Carvel says next is full of the anticipation felt by someone who has not appeared in front of a theatre audience since 2019: “That’s one of the things I’m going to have a lot of fun with when we get one.” We talk in one of the Old Vic’s upstairs rooms. Carvel, who turned 44 last year, is about to go into another day of rehearsals. His regular digressions into the granular detail of acting highlight both his famous levels of dedication to his craft (one associate has talked about his talent being partly based on “obsessive worrying” about his roles), and the fact that, with only a fortnight until The 47th begins its first run, he is deeply immersed in his latest job. Carvel looks about as different from Trump as anyone conceivably could: rake-slim (when he had a beard, an interviewer once compared him to “an extremely thin Rasputin”), and dressed in a grey sweatshirt and slim-fit jeans, though he carries a somewhat Trumpian blue baseball cap with him. Whether he will play the former president with any special physical adornments is currently undecided, he says: he might take the “Brechtian” option of spurning makeup and costumery, or, alternatively, try to look as close to Trump as he can. “I would love it – to walk out on stage, and for people to go [gasps], ‘It’s him!’ But there’s something just as satisfying about people saying, ‘How’s this guy going to do Donald Trump?’ and then thinking, ‘I’m convinced.’” As well as Trump’s personal foibles, the play also explores what convinces millions of people to support him – not just base prejudice, but resentment about America’s deep economic inequalities, and the gaps that separate well-intentioned, affluent liberals from the kind of people who now form Trump’s electoral base. The basic point is made when Trump turns on Harris and accuses her and her allies of snobbery and condescension towards his voters: “You speak to them like kids, and not just kids but poorer, less good-looking / Trashy kids, that you and your celebrities / All constant lecture, from your raised pile / They stay on lowest wage while you reserve / Your fight for theory built in Ivy League.” Here, I suggest, is something very close to Trump’s authentic point of view. “It would be a turkey shoot if you didn’t give Trump a voice to make his argument,” says Carvel. He then talks about something that was obvious when Trump first ran for the Republican nomination: that his candidacy was tapping into not only some of people’s worst instincts, but a lot of undeniable economic and social inequalities as well. “At the time, we were laughing at the idea that he could become the Republican nominee, let alone the president but, actually, he was giving voice to the anxieties and stark inequalities which mean that people who want to stoke division and splinter democracy are able to do – because of something underlying it all: something real, which is worth thinking about.” In many liberal and leftwing circles, I remind him, as Trump’s time in the White House went on and his rule became grimmer and grimmer, that way of looking at his success was quickly deemed unacceptable. The done thing is still to blame his rise to power simply on the politics of hate, so painting even a slightly more nuanced picture will probably unsettle and even enrage many of the people who come to see the play. “It’s … challenging, yeah,” Carvel says. “But that’s what theatre should do: provocation, making an audience uncomfortable. Inviting them to think.” When he first read it, did the script make him uncomfortable? There’s a very long pause, before his face assumes an expression of camped-up guilt. “To be honest, I was thinking about how to do it. And I was like, ‘Oooh-hoo!’” He rubs his hands with theatrical glee. As well as King Lear, one of the other obvious Shakespearean influences on The 47th is Macbeth, which brings us to another of Carvel’s recent roles. The end of last year saw the release of The Tragedy of Macbeth, Joel Coen’s monochrome reimagining with Denzel Washington in the titular role, alongside Frances McDormand as Lady Macbeth. Carvel played Banquo, the close friend and confidant of Macbeth, whose murder decisively marks the latter’s descent into evil and madness. Carvel ensured his character had a truly remarkable set of fake eyebrows. “Joel kept using the words ‘architectural’ and ‘sculptural’. And I said: ‘I’d love him to look like an Easter Island statue.’ I was like, ‘There needs to be something about his eyes, because I feel that he’s a seer; he’s a clairvoyant.’” A six-week shoot in Los Angeles was planned, which was preceded by three weeks of rehearsals. “That’s unheard of,” Carvel enthuses. “Fran McDormand, who produced it as well as playing Lady Macbeth, was very keen that we should rehearse like a theatre company. So we did read throughs, and rehearsed the scenes in situ. She and Denzel were there every day.” What did he learn from acting in scenes alongside Washington? “One of the things that strikes me about great movie actors is that you often find that there’s a lot more captured by the camera than is visible to the naked eye. That’s just something they instinctively understand.” Due to the pandemic, production was paused in March 2020 – whereupon Carvel and his wife, the actor Sally Scott, legged it back to the UK. She was eight months pregnant, and their son Ernest was born just over a month later; Carvel credits his son’s arrival with dampening down some of those more intense actorly instincts of his. Then, in August, he was summoned back to California. “I went back to LA for a few days on a very glamorous private jet, with two other actors. The first lockdown had just about ended, but we had to stand by for days to have all our entry papers cleared to get to the US. It was a proper Learjet. I’m afraid my carbon footprint has never recovered.” And so to another character defined by ambition and power. Carvel has just filmed the first part of his portrayal of Tony Blair for The Crown. Blair’s first election victory arrives towards the end of season five, which will go out in November. Imelda Staunton has taken over from Olivia Colman as the Queen, with Jonathan Pryce as Prince Philip; Dominic West is Prince Charles, with the Australian actor Elizabeth Debicki at the heart of the drama as Princess Diana. (Jonny Lee Miller, who starred alongside Carvel in James Graham’s play Ink, will play Blair’s predecessor, John Major.) Carvel cannot say much about his role, but tells me he has been channelling the feelings of hope and excitement he himself felt back in the summer of 1997. “That’s been very important: to remember that feeling,” he says. “The bit we’ve shot so far is just the beginning of that new dawn.” He was 20 then. What does he recall of the period he has just recreated? “Just being a young person, it felt to me like hope was alive again. And to be honest, I think that what they achieved … well, I don’t remember in my lifetime Britain feeling better looked after. The thing I always remember is those Sure Start centres. I’m sure I was in my echo chamber, and I’m aware of the critiques of that government, but I think what they achieved was extraordinary. Before things went sour, I feel like that was a great moment.” He is playing Blair at the exact same age the former Labour leader was when he became prime minister – which must make the part less daunting than becoming Trump. “Oh, I think Tony Blair is just as much of a dress-up act,” he says. “It’s a contract: people know you’re not who you say you are, but there’s a sensation you get when people believe you anyway. The biggest fear is not being believed. And that can be just as loud when you’re playing a character who is superficially incredibly similar to you.” Carvel’s habit of playing politicians is partly traceable to his family. He is the son, grandson and great-grandson of journalists; his father, John, was the Guardian’s social affairs editor. But just as relevant is the career of his late mother, Patricia, who died in 2019. She studied psychology and philosophy before becoming a senior civil servant, and developing an admirable expertise in the skills and qualities of leadership. “I believe in leadership,” Carvel says at one point, but he goes on to lament what is now often missing from politics and power. “The substance is often buried. Trying to locate the substance in a lot of Donald Trump’s speeches can be difficult. He’s not bothered by the detail of where he’s going to go. That’s the great challenge of our age, isn’t it? And it’s what this play is thinking about: how moderates restore a politics that’s rooted in policies, and measured outcomes, not in …” He pauses, and, knowing he is about to be called back to rehearsals, I fill the silence. The roar of the crowd? “Yeah, that’s nice,” he says. “The roar of the crowd.” The 47th is at the Old Vic theatre, London (oldvictheatre.com), from 29 March until 28 May.",Arts/Stage,‘I get a chill’: Bertie Carvel on exploring the human side of Donald Trump,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/26/i-get-a-chill-bertie-carvel-on-exploring-the-human-side-of-donald-trump
3/26/2022,"According to Isabela Eseverri, Caracas has a very specific morning soundtrack. Wake early enough in Venezuela’s capital and you’ll hear the transition from crickets to birds, most notably the loud chachalacas. The bark from a neighbourhood dog sets off the rest, then, later, the macaws join in. “Growing up, you didn’t see them much, but in the last decade their population has grown exponentially,” Eseverri says. “Because they’re an invasive species there are worries that they threaten our local bird population, but the locals adore them and feed them. You’ll be on the freeway and you’ll see 10 of these incredibly colourful birds fly by. It’s in keeping with the Latin American magical realism I love so much.” Eseverri was staying at her parents’ hillside house for holiday celebrations in November 2021 when she took this photo; everyone was up early to make celebratory hallacas, a traditional dish similar to Mexican tamales. While the coconut tree in their garden usually attracts one or two macaws every few days – they tend to fly in pairs – that morning Eseverri spotted six. She scrambled upstairs with her phone in hand, just as one settled on a palm tree at eye level with her first-floor bedroom window. “I had seconds to set up my shot, so you could see the whole of Avila mountain in the background and the city below, rather than zooming right in on the palm tree.” A few seconds later a second bird entered the frame, followed by two more close behind. “Five seconds later they were gone,” Eseverri says. “It was serendipity mixed with incredible timing.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,"‘Seconds later, the macaws were gone’: Isabela Eseverri’s best phone picture",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/26/seconds-later-macaws-were-gone-isabela-eseverri-best-phone-picture
3/26/2022,"Jannina Campos walks up a sandy hillside in Arica, a port city on the edge of the Atacama desert, the driest place on the planet. The slope is dotted with dozens of orange markers placed in December. Each indicates skeletal remains recently uncovered by unusually strong winds and increased rainfall. “Every time a body appears we place a flag, and we bury it again,” said Campos, an archaeologist. “They’ve been preserved there for 7,000 years.” The sprawling cemetery belongs to the Chinchorro, an ancient culture of hunters and fishers who painstakingly mummified their dead. After stripping their loved ones of their skin and organs, they swaddled their skeletons in elaborate confections of reeds, sea lion skins, clay, alpaca wool, and wigs of human hair, trusting in the arid desert climate to preserve them for eternity. But their gravesites, dotted around Chile’s far north, are increasingly being disturbed by abnormal weather linked to the climate crisis, and their remains left exposed to the elements. This presents cash-strapped archaeologists with a dilemma: try to rescue everything they can, or simply cover up the cadavers and focus on conserving and studying already-excavated mummies. “The museums are a bit overwhelmed with all this material,” said Bernardo Arriaza, a leading expert on the Chinchorro at the University of Tarapacá in Arica. Increasing humidity in the Atacama is damaging the mummies already in collections. Some are sprouting with mould; others are succumbing to dry rot or being nibbled by insects. Their eclectic mix of materials makes it hard to get storage conditions exactly right, he added. “There’s no magic solution.” At a museum a short walk down the hill, Campos pointed through a glass floor to dozens of skeletal Chinchorro bodies below, the sand around them speckled with white fragments. “That’s the bones turning to dust,” she said. A ray of hope came last July, when the Chinchorro mummies were inscribed on the Unesco World Heritage list after a laborious, 20-year application process. Many anticipate that growing appreciation for the mummies – and the beginning of construction this year of a new, climate-controlled £14m ($19m) museum near Arica – could help arrest the disappearance of what Arriaza calls “a wonder of world prehistory”. The Chinchorro mummies are the earliest examples of deliberate mummification anywhere in the world, say scholars. They date back to 5,000BC – more than two millennia before Egyptian pharaohs were first embalmed and entombed in pyramids. They also possess a striking aesthetic value – and a poignant human resonance. The semi-nomadic coastal dwellers cast no pottery nor built any monuments. Instead, “the body becomes a kind of canvas where they express their emotions,” said Arriaza. “The Chinchorro transform their dead into genuine works of pre-Hispanic art.” A clue as to why this remarkable outpouring of feeling may have first emerged lies in Caleta Camarones, 60 miles south of Arica. Sitting at the mouth of a green, fertile river valley gouged through barren desert, the spot is an Eden-like oasis – and its fresh drinking water and teeming animal life probably enticed the first Chinchorro to settle here. But it had hidden dangers, said Arriaza. The Camarones River carries 1000 micrograms per litre of arsenic: a hundred times the safe human limit. With every drink of water, the Chinchorro were unknowingly poisoning themselves, analysis of hair samples shows – and they suffered high rates of miscarriages and infant deaths as a result. The earliest Chinchorro mummies come from here: tiny babies and stillborn foetuses, their fragile forms bolstered by sticks and adorned by sparingly carved masks of black manganese. Over 3,500 years, Chinchorro mummification spread to adults and evolved – via ochre-daubed corpses stuffed with feathers to bandages of pelican skin. Today, residents of Caleta Camarones feel a strong affinity with the Chinchorro, said Jorge Ardiles, part of a group of artisanal fishing families who settled here 30 years ago. “It’s not a genetic link, but a natural connection,” he said. “They were fishermen; so are we.” Ardiles drove his battered truck along the shoreline, and pointed out deep excavations lined with dense banks of discarded mollusc shells. “Right there is where they found the oldest mummies in the world,” he said proudly. “All this hillside is full of bodies.” A few metres above the track, resting on ancient reed mats, several skeletons jutted out of the scree, uncovered by wind and rain and now at the mercy of grave robbers and the elements. “The authorities don’t care,” Ardiles lamented. “We’re the ones looking after the area.” The fisher argued that a basic site museum should display Chinchorro artefacts found by locals: quartz arrowheads, fish hooks, combs made of cactus spines. But efforts to get small-scale tourism initiatives off the ground have stalled, partly because the community is the subject of a decades-long land dispute. Visitors are often disappointed not to find pristine cadavers in Inca-style palaces, said Cristian Zavala, the local mayor. “If you go to Machu Picchu, it’s obvious,” he said. “But here, the history is below the ground.” Zavala expressed hope that UNESCO status, and Chile’s current redrafting of its dictatorship-era constitution, could force the government to better protect and promote the mummies. “Look how many bodies are turning up,” the mayor added, gesturing at the bone-studded slope. “If we don’t look after the Chinchorro, they’ll vanish because of climate change.” The living are also suffering the effects of ecological upheaval. The nearby ocean is emptying of marine life, warned Ardiles, blaming overfishing by trawlers and warming waters. The younger generation are abandoning fishing and entering the Atacama’s mining industry – itself increasingly under fire for exhausting water resources and contaminating the desert. “I can’t see the fishermen continuing here,” Ardiles reflected. “We’re going to disappear, like the Chinchorro.”",News/Science,Chile’s archaeologists fight to save the world’s oldest mummies from climate change,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/26/mummies-chile-archaeologists-save-climate-change
