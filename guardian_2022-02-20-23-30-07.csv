2/20/2022,"The country is “in a different world” from when the Covid pandemic started, Boris Johnson has said, meaning the last remaining restrictions can begin to be lifted from next week. Ahead of an announcement on Monday about the government’s “living with Covid” strategy, the prime minister signalled free mass testing would end imminently and told people to return to the office and “get their confidence back”.  “We’ve reached a stage where we think you can shift the balance away from state mandation – away from banning certain courses of action, compelling certain courses of action – in favour of encouraging personal responsibility,” he said on Sunday. Concerns have been raised by some scientists and health experts about the mooted plans to drop the legal requirement for people to self-isolate, scrap the majority of free lateral flow tests and end most contact tracing. Labour has also argued the move is premature, and accused ministers of wanting to “declare victory before the war is over”. But Johnson was bullish about the prospects of returning most freedoms to their pre-Covid frontiers. Speaking to the BBC’s Sunday Morning programme, he said “now is the time” to press ahead with reining in public spending and ending restrictions. “I think it’s very important we should remain careful,” Johnson said. “We’re certainly not asking people to throw caution to the winds. Covid remains a dangerous disease, particularly if you haven’t been vaccinated and if you’re vulnerable. “There are still people who haven’t been properly vaccinated, there are still people who haven’t had their booster. Huge numbers have, but there are still people who haven’t, so there is no case for complacency about this.” Johnson said testing would happen “at a much lower level” as it was unsustainable to continue spending £2bn a month on the scheme. He added: “We’re in a different world. I think it is it is important that people should feel confident again and people should feel able to go back to work in the normal way. I do want to see our country really getting back on its feet … Now’s the moment for everybody to get their confidence back.” Johnson did not rule out restrictions being imposed. He said: “I don’t want to go back to that kind of non-pharmaceutical intervention. I want to be able to address the problems of the pandemic with a vaccine-led approach … but I’m afraid you’ve got to be humble in the face of nature.” Wes Streeting, Labour’s shadow health secretary, told the same programme that the move “seems very premature” and used the analogy of a football team being one goal ahead and then taking off their best defender in the closing minutes of the game. “I’m not clear that the scientific advice supports this,” he said, adding that he stood with those groups who have raised concerns, such as the NHS Confederation, World Health Organization and British Medical Association, “any day of the week and twice on Sunday”. “At this stage, it’s not the right thing to do,” Streeting added. He accused the government of “glaring inconsistencies” in its approach to relaxing restrictions and trying to distract attention from Scotland Yard’s investigation into a dozen alleged parties in breach of Covid rules, some of which were attended by Johnson. Streeting said it did not make sense for the prime minister to still be advising people to stay at home – even if it was not mandated – without continuing the support payments for low-income workers and free testing. “It does seem to me that the whole decision making process in No 10 at the moment is being driven by the prime minister’s political weakness, not by public health, and that should concern all of us,” he added. Johnson is expected to call a cabinet meeting on Monday, where the plan for lifting Covid rules will be signed off before a likely announcement in the House of Commons.",News/World news,‘We’re in a different world’: PM defends end of Covid rules in England,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/20/uk-different-world-pandemic-johnson-covid-restrictions-eased-england
2/20/2022,"As if from nowhere a title race has appeared. Manchester City’s 12-point lead is down to six which means that if Liverpool win their game in hand and if Liverpool win at the Etihad Stadium in April, they will be level on points. City are still in the better position, particularly given they have not lost a league game at home to Liverpool under Pep Guardiola but what had started to look like a procession, quite unexpectedly, has regained a sense of intrigue. It is an indication of how dominant City had come to appear that this feels surprising. Liverpool, after all, have won 11 of their past 14 Premier League matches. In any previous era, that would have been obvious title-winning form. Drawing at Tottenham and Chelsea and losing by a single goal at Leicester should not be a wobble from which there is no coming back.  That is a wider concern: it is always tempting for English football to congratulate itself because it has not gone the way of some many European leagues and become a monopoly, but it is still troubling if winning the title means having to pick up at least 95 points. That is not the sign of a league that is providing healthy competition on a regular basis. That those are the standards is down in part to the genius of Jürgen Klopp and Guardiola, but also to a broken financial structure. More immediately, though, what is striking is that the expectation had been that Liverpool would wobble in January and February as Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané went to the Cup of Nations – not just for the two league games they would miss but because there is always a risk after any tournament of emotional hangover. That the pair faced each other in the final could have heightened that; it took a lot of England’s players until late autumn to begin to find their rhythm again after the Euros. So far, though, there has been no indication at all that either is suffering any kind of reaction. In that, it helps that the great front three now has back-up. Diogo Jota had already given one extra option, but Luis Díaz has settled remarkably quickly. Playing for Klopp looks complicated; it must take players time to learn the pressing schema and assimilate the patterns but, as Klopp has said, Díaz looked a Liverpool player from the moment he first stepped on the pitch for them. The famous front three have scored four goals between them in the past two games without all being on the field together at any point. Jordan Henderson and Thiago Alcântara have also both made significant contributions from the bench in the past week: little wonder Klopp speaks of this squad as the greatest he has had. The danger for those hoping for a proper title race is that this becomes a two-team procession in the way 2018-19 was. Then a run of four draws in six games from the end of January to the beginning of March was enough for Liverpool to cede their advantage to City; Liverpool won their last nine league games of the season but could not get past City as they won their final 14. It was all very impressive, a great demonstration both of ability and nerve, but it was also, for the neutral, rather lacking in drama. A great title race, like 1971-72 or 2011-12, demands fallibility. City had looked remorseless. The title race had seemed over less because it was inconceivable that Liverpool should embark on a winning run than because it seemed implausible City would drop enough points to let them back in. When a side wins 14 out of 16 games, it feels absurd to identify flaws, but perhaps in retrospect there have been hints that they were not quite so impermeable as they appeared. Leicester, in losing 6-3 to them, showed in the second half that City could still be vulnerable to counter-attacks, that those balls played in behind the defensive line that have always been a potential vulnerability could still cause problems. Spurs were ruthless in exploiting that, largely because City struggled to deal with Harry Kane as he dropped off the front line. He was a danger both with balls played on the turn to runners outside him and with his late runs. The attacking nature of City’s full-backs means the sort of run from Son Heung-min that led to Tottenham’s opening goal is always a potential danger, but where City have been able to neutralise that is in the form of Rodri blocking the space Kane exploited to spring Son. Kane, for all the complaints that he should spend more time in the box, is exceptionally good at that. His relationship with Son is very close, but other sides may look at that, and the way James Maddison played against City, and see an opportunity. Still, perspective is required. City still had the better expected goals (xG) against Tottenham. Not since the defeat to Brighton in the penultimate game of last season, by which point City’s focus had firmly switched to the Champions League, have City had a lower xG than their opponents in a league game. They remain an awesome force. But there is, perhaps, at last, just a glitch in their relentlessness and, if Liverpool maintain their exceptional form, there may yet be some life in this season. At the very least a neutral can hope there is enough doubt that that game on 9 April feels meaningful.",Sport/Football,Premier League title race has finally regained its intrigue as Man City falter | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/20/premier-league-title-race-has-finally-regained-its-intrigue

2/20/2022,"London lawyers who help the global super-rich apply for “golden visas” to enter the UK have called on the government to reconsider its decision to abolish the Tier 1 investor visa scheme, warning that it would be “enormously damaging” to the economy. Kyra Motley, a partner at the law firm Boodle Hatfield, said the UK was jeopardising billions of pounds in overseas investment “because of a popular myth that foreign money is dirty money”.  “On a conservative calculation, the investor visa scheme has brought in over £17bn of investment into the UK over the last decade,” she said. “That is a substantial success.” The home secretary, Priti Patel, announced the immediate closure of the scheme last week to stop “corrupt elites who threaten our national security and push dirty money around our cities”. More than 12,000 golden visas have been granted since the scheme was launched in 2008, including more than 2,500 to Russians. The programme allowed people with at least £2m in investment funds and a UK bank account to apply for residency rights, along with their family. The speed with which applicants were allowed to get indefinite leave to remain was hastened by how much money they planned to invest in the UK: £2m took five years, while £10m shortened the wait to just two. Chetal Patel, a partner at law firm Bates Wells, said scrapping the investor visa because of increased tensions over Russia’s threat to Ukraine would be “unfair” to other rich people wishing to come to the UK. “A blanket ban would be cutting off one’s nose to spite their face. “Since the introduction of golden visas in 2008, the UK has benefited from billions of pounds of investment. It would be enormously damaging to the UK economy if this was to be cut off.” After the 2018 Salisbury poisonings of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, a former Russian military officer and his daughter, the government launched a review into the investors awarded visas from 2008-15. The review has yet to be published. The scheme remained open, despite parliament’s joint intelligence and security committee saying in 2020 that it was “welcoming oligarchs with open arms”.",News/News,‘Golden visa’ lawyers call for UK to rethink blanket ban,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/20/golden-visa-lawyers-call-for-uk-to-rethink-blanket-ban
2/20/2022,"Stravinsky formed the focus of Iván Fischer and the Budapest Festival Orchestra’s Festival Hall visit, a pair of remarkable concerts exploring his output early and late. Both were structured around one of the ballets written for Diaghilev – Petrushka in the first concert, The Rite of Spring the next evening – preceded in each case by a work for soloist and orchestra (the Violin Concerto, the Capriccio for piano and orchestra) and a neoclassical piece from the 1930s or 40s (Jeu de Cartes, the Concerto in D for strings). The Diaghilev ballets were both magnificently done, Petrushka in particular: this was one of the finest performances I’ve heard of it in London for some time. The central narrative, tragic yet ironic, was thrown into sharp relief by the cacophony of the Shrovetide fair, vivid in its whirling detail and verve. Petrushka’s shrieks of desire and despair combined pathos with grotesquerie, nowhere more so than at the close when his ghost confronts the Magician who has created and abused him. The Moor’s music had a heady sensuality, while the Ballerina’s flute and cornet solos were all flirtatious impertinence. The Rite of Spring was comparably powerful, edge-of-your-seat stuff, with great beauty amid the violence (the Mystic Circles of the Young Girls were simply ravishing) gradually accumulating tension as it went, rather than eruptive and seething from the outset.  The soloists in the concertante works differed sharply in their approaches. Patricia Kopatchinskaja, for whom theatricality is integral to performance, seemed not so much to play the Violin Concerto as to live it, acting and even dancing to the music, none of which detracted from her dazzling technique and expressive brilliance. Nicolas Namoradze, in the altogether cooler Capriccio, was ideally laconic and debonair, weighty yet exquisite, and exactingly precise in tone and touch. Fischer, who conducts with boundless energy, did wonders with Jeu de Cartes, a comic yet austere work that can be tricky to get right. Larger than usual forces elevated sinewy neoclassicism to mock-baroque loftiness, while the ironic allusions to Rossini and parodic yet affectionate gestures towards the divertissements of imperial Russian ballet bristled with brilliance and wit. The Concerto for strings, effectively a concerto grosso, sounded gracious, svelte and consummately elegant. “This is an outstanding orchestra,” Kopatchinskaja declared before launching into two of Bartók’s Duets for Two Violins, as an encore, with István Kádár, one of the orchestral violinists. She is indeed right, and their playing was sensational throughout.",Arts/Music,BFO/Fischer review – Stravinsky dazzles and thrills in two sensational concerts ,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/20/bfo-budapest-festival-orchestra-ivan-fischer-kopatchinskaja-namoradze-review-royal-festival-hall-london
