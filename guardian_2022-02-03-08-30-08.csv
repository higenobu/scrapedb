2/3/2022,"Authorities have warned regional water utilities that the severing of the rail link between Western Australia and eastern states posed an “escalating risk” of shortages of a critical chemical used in water treatment. The New South Wales water directorate on Wednesday said a major supplier of aluminium sulphate – or alum – had warned eastern customers that disruptions of the east-west railway due to flooding had halted deliveries of a key ingredient, aluminium trihydrate.  “At the same time as this potential supply shortage, recent widespread heavy rainfall across regional NSW is likely to create water quality challenges,” the directorate said. “Water utilities must carefully operate and monitor their critical control points, especially when raw water conditions change.” The shortage does not affect Sydney Water, which uses iron-based ferric chloride. While the chemical can be substituted, “it’s not something that you would want to have to switch over too suddenly”, Prof Stuart Khan of the University of NSW school of civil and environmental engineering said. While there was nothing to be alarmed about, the sudden shortfall showed “it’s a game of dominoes”, Khan said. “It takes one weak link in the chain to not be in place and you have all these various unexpected consequences.” Many inland rivers were already muddy after heavy rains, meaning utilities would typically need more alum for treatment. “There would be a high demand for good coagulation and you need to get that coagulation right in order to have the right conditions for chlorine disinfection [to treat pathogens],” Khan said. “If you are struggling to remove colour and turbidity from water because you haven’t gotten your alum dosing right, then you potentially risk your disinfection performance.” Ixom, the Melbourne-based supplier of alum, was approached for comment, as was Alcoa WA, the maker of aluminium trihydrate. “The NSW government takes the issue of safe and secure water very seriously,” a spokesperson for the planning and environment department said.

The water directorate noted that NSW Health had written to all water utilities in regional NSW “to review, update and enact their business continuity plans in response to operational disruptions caused by supply chain interruptions or staff shortages”. Utilities were asked to activate contingency plans if alum stocks were at risk of running out. These include substituting alternative agents, conserving supplies or sharing chemicals with other plants or partners.",News/Australia news,Water treatment chemical shortage looms in eastern states after floods cut WA rail link,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/03/water-treatment-chemical-shortage-looms-in-eastern-states-after-floods-cut-wa-rail-link
2/3/2022,"Boosting exposure to bright light during the daytime and dimming the lights in the evening could help to improve blood sugar control in people with pre-diabetes, data suggests. Light plays a key role in synchronising the body’s internal or circadian clock – which controls the timing of multiple biological processes – to the 24-hour day-night cycle.  Previous research has suggested exposure to light at night can disrupt these rhythms, while working night shifts has been associated with a greater risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. There is also evidence that being exposed to too little light during the daytime may disrupt the rhythms, resulting in poorer sleep. To investigate how light exposure affects people’s metabolism, Jan-Frieder Harmsen and Prof Patrick Schrauwen, of Maastricht University Medical Centre in the Netherlands, and colleagues brought 14 overweight individuals with pre-diabetes into specially designed respiration chambers – airtight cabins that can measure people’s energy expenditure using various sensors – for two 40-hour sessions. During one session they were exposed to bright light – roughly equivalent to the lighting in a supermarket freezer aisle – between 8am and 6pm, followed by dim light during the evening and darkness after 11pm. During the other session, the lights were kept dimmed – though bright enough to see – during the daytime, followed by bright light during the evening and darkness after 11pm. Meal content and timing was kept constant between the two sessions. Pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes are characterised by high blood sugar levels, which gradually damage blood vessels and vital organs. Exposure to bright daytime lighting was associated with better blood sugar control. Participants also burned more calories after the evening meal and overnight, compared with when daytime lighting was dim. In the long-term, burning slightly more calories after each meal could help prevent weight gain, Schrauwen said. The scientists also noticed a greater difference in body temperature between day and night when participants were exposed to more naturalistic light patterns. Not only does a drop in body temperature at night help to initiate sleep, it is closely tied to blood pressure control. “Pre-diabetes is often also associated with higher blood pressure, and so potentially a brighter day and dimmer evening can contribute to better blood pressure regulation,” Harmsen said. The results were published in Diabetologia, the journal of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes. “Many people live under suboptimal light conditions; often the light in their houses or offices isn’t bright enough, and they are exposed to light at night from their computers, and so on,” said Schrauwen. “We are quite convinced that all these factors contribute to the development of diabetes. It’s not only eating too much or exercising too little, we think that this 24-hour culture is a major factor.” Based on these results, he said, people should try to boost their daytime light exposure and keep the lights dim during the evening. “We know that a disturbed metabolism is so important in the development of diabetes, so if we have ways to improve that, we should do them,” he said. Frank Scheer, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School’s sleep medicine division, said: “This research highlights the influence of our daily light exposure on our bodily functions; not only in the regulation of melatonin – a hormone typically released at night, and which is associated with sleepiness – which has been known for decades, but also for metabolism. “Melatonin was recently discovered to play an important role in glucose regulation and other aspects of metabolism, so future studies are needed to test to what degree the effects of light are dependent on its suppression, and if some individuals are genetically more susceptible.”",News/Society,Pre-diabetes study finds benefit in brighter days and dimmer evenings,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/02/pre-diabetes-study-finds-benefit-in-brighter-days-and-dimmer-evenings
2/3/2022,"Player wages rose across Europe in 2021 even as club revenues continued to fall, a Uefa report has found. Top-flight clubs made a combined €4bn (£3.4bn) loss in the Covid-hit 2020-21 season, according to the report, while wages rose by an average of 2%. In total, wage costs – and agents’ fees – accounted for spending that equalled 91% of revenue. This led to an increase in outside lending, with clubs taking on more than €750m in new debt.  Uefa’s Club Licensing Benchmarking Report is an authoritative study of 724 clubs who compete in the 54 top divisions of its member countries. It paints a picture of a sport broadsided by Covid and riven by structural inequalities, posting numbers that underline calls for reform of the game’s finances. Andrea Traverso, Uefa’s director of financial sustainability and research, said the report “clearly demonstrates” the need for change. “There are really only two things that can protect football and prepare it for future shocks,” he says in an introduction to the report. “The first is a meaningful move towards better cost control, in particular in relation to wages and transfers, and greater emphasis on long-term investments in infrastructure and youth development. The second … is to rebuild the equity buffer. Cash reserves shored up over the past decade have been an important first line of defence against revenue shortfalls.” The majority of losses accrued by clubs came from the effect of playing behind closed doors, with revenues from ticket sales falling by 88% in 2020-21. Clubs were also hit by a fall in transfer revenues, with money generated by sales dropping by 40%. These two factors, Traverso argues, helped to drive up wages as clubs tied down players to extended contracts. “Clubs throughout the top 20 leagues have had to choose between limiting new salary deals, even if that means putting player assets valued on their balance sheets at €13bn at risk, or protecting those assets by extending player contracts,” he says. There are qualifications in the report, with some of the 2020-21 figures based on the accounts of 95 “early reporting” clubs. The delayed end to the 2019-20 season also deferred revenues for some clubs. The report suggests reasons to be hopeful, with a rise in the value of key sponsorship and kit deals and good prospects for future international TV rights. Most importantly, 2021-22 saw the return of fans to stadiums and the passion that local communities continue to have for their clubs. The Uefa president, Aleksander Ceferin, said: “The Covid crisis has highlighted to what extent football is part of the fabric of European life. Football was a true lifeline for many. I will make no bold predictions for the year ahead, except to say that, whether the pandemic stays or goes, European football will remain strong, stable and united in 2022.”",Sport/Football,"Europe’s top clubs lost €4bn last season as player wages rose, claims Uefa report",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/02/europe-top-clubs-lost-4bn-uefa-report-finances-wages
2/3/2022,"A US intelligence report by a panel of expert scientists has named pulsed electromagnetic energy and ultrasound as plausible causes for the mystery Havana Syndrome symptoms suffered by US diplomats and spies in recent years. The report found that a group of cases could not be explained by health or environmental factors or by psychosomatic illness. It also said that devices exist with “modest energy requirements” which were concealable and could produce the observed symptoms and be effective over hundreds of meters or through walls.  The panel, established last year by the director of national security, Avril Haines, and the CIA director, William Burns, said the investigation was not tasked to identify a culprit, but in a statement accompanying the report, Haines and Burns said it would help sharpen the search for the origins of they mysterious ailments. “We will stay at it, with continued rigor, for however long it takes,” they said. In a redacted executive summary of its report published on Wednesday, the panel of experts said that the signs and symptoms of the syndrome were “diverse and may be caused by multiple mechanisms” but that a subset of them “cannot be easily explained by known environmental or medical conditions”. The expert panel report clashed in tone to a briefing given by the CIA last month which said that in the majority of cases, there was no sign of a malignant campaign by a foreign power. That briefing, possibly aimed at limiting the further spread of psychosocial illness among US officials, did caution that in some two dozen cases the symptoms could not be easily explained. The latest panel narrowed its review of the hundreds of reported cases by defining four “core characteristics”: the sudden onset of sound or pressure in one ear or one side of the head; near simultaneous symptoms like vertigo, loss of balance and ear pain; a “strong sense of locality or directionality” – the feeling of being assailed from a particular direction; and the absence of known environmental or medical conditions that might otherwise explain the symptoms. The summary did not go into details of cases, but the description of symptoms matched the earliest cases in 2016 reported among US and Canadian diplomats stationed in Havana, from which the syndrome got its name. The expert panel found “the combination of the four core characteristics is distinctly unusual and unreported elsewhere in the medical literature, and so far have not been associated with a specific neurological abnormality.” When looking at probable causes, the panel – which includes experts on medicine and engineering – pointed towards some form of external energy source. The report found that: “Pulsed electromagnetic energy, particularly in the radio frequency range, plausibly explains the core characteristics, although information gaps exist.” It added that “sources exist that could generate the required stimulus, are concealable, and have moderate power requirements.” Using what the report described as “nonstandard antennas and techniques”, electromagnetic pulsed energy could be directed at a target “through air for tens to hundreds of meters, and with some loss, through most building materials”. Pulsed electromagnetic energy had been “credibly demonstrated” to cause the observed symptoms, the panel found, and that “persons accidentally exposed to radio frequency signals described sensations similar to the core characteristics”. However, the report said there was a “dearth of research” on the effects of such pulsed electromagnetic energy on humans. Engineers who had been working on a potential weapon for the US marines two decades ago, known as Medusa, said that one of the reasons it was discontinued was that it was ethically impossible to conduct human tests on the prototype. A large part of the section on pulsed electromagnetic energy was redacted in the published expert panel report. The executive summary said that ultrasound energy was also a plausible explanation for the symptoms but only in situations where the source was close to the target. “The required energy can be generated by ultrasonic arrays that are portable, and produce a tight beam,” it found, but noted that “ultrasound propagates poorly through air and building materials”. The report said that psychosocial factors could not explain the cases exhibiting the four core characteristics of Havana Syndrome but could have made them worse. Such factors could also explain other incidents which “could be due to hypervigilance and normal human reactions to stress and ambiguity, particularly among a workforce attuned to its surroundings and trained to think about security”. A victims group issued a statement on Wednesday arguing the new report “reinforces the need for the intelligence community and the broader US government to redouble their efforts to fully understand the causes of … Havana Syndrome”. Mark Zaid, a Washington attorney representing victims from multiple federal agencies, said: “These piecemeal agency reviews at times reveal inconsistent and even contradictory results that undermine the effort to resolve this controversy.”",News/US news,Havana Syndrome could be caused by pulsed energy devices – US expert report,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/02/havana-syndrome-concealable-devices-cia-report
2/3/2022,"Britain risks becoming trapped in a vicious cycle of low growth and high taxation unless the government takes radical steps to boost investment, raise skills, cut red tape and exploit the opportunities of the green economy, a leading business lobby group is warning. Tony Danker, the director general of the CBI, will use a speech on Thursday to criticise ministers for a lack of ambition as he outlines a five-point plan to restore the UK’s underlying growth rate to the levels seen before the financial crisis of 2007-09.  In an echo of arguments made by the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday, Danker will say ministers need to be bolder if the UK is to cope with rising spending pressures generated by an ageing population. “The current settlement isn’t working. There are rising spending pressures; too much tax; and too little growth,” he will say. “We’re caught in a trap.” Speaking at an event jointly organised by the CBI and a rightwing thinktank, the Centre for Policy Studies, Danker will point to forecasts by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility showing the economy growing at an annual rate of between 1.3-1.7% once it had recovered from the pandemic. “For a country that is used to growth at 2-2.5% it is simply not good enough,” the organisation’s chief will say. “And what’s truly worrying is that the government has accepted the forecast as the target. Everything the government is currently trying to get growth going merely achieves a new normal of low growth. “But to government I say now is not a time to lowball our ambitions, to settle for a new normal of low growth. After a disappointing economic decade past, this is our second chance.” Danker will stress he is not talking about growth at all costs but sustainable long-term growth resulting from higher investment, innovation and productivity. The CBI’s five-point plan for faster growth involves: A permanent 100% tax deduction for capital spending to boost investment when the Treasury’s 130% “super deduction” ends in March 2023. Replacing the apprenticeship levy with a skills challenge fund so the UK matches European average skills investment. Doubling-down on green growth by closing the public investment gap with competitor countries on the transition to a net-zero model. The CBI says an extra £3bn a year is needed to retrofit homes to make them more energy efficient. Establishing an Office for Future Regulation to support a post-Brexit regulatory framework that is agile and dynamic and focused on future needs. Creating an independent Council for Future Skills to match training towards future economic demand and recommend where visas for international skills are needed to overcome shortages in homegrown talent. Danker will say he accepts the government is in a tough spot after amassing a record peacetime budget deficit during the pandemic. “They say we can’t afford to spend more on growth. But I say we can’t afford not to. Simply put, we will not pay down today’s debt, extend public services and reduce taxes on 1.6%.” On current plans, taxes as a share of the economy will return to levels last seen when Clement Attlee was the postwar Labour prime minister in the early 1950s. “Today’s high spending, high taxes and low growth is a vicious cycle that’s hard to break,” Danker will say. “Meeting the needs of an ageing population in the years ahead will put even more pressure on the public purse. By our calculations, by 2030 we may need to find an additional £40bn-£50bn a year to cover the costs of an ageing society, and more than double that by the middle of the next decade.”",News/Business,CBI says Britain risks cycle of low growth without higher investment,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/02/cbi-says-britain-risks-cycle-of-low-growth-without-higher-investment
