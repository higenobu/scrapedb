4/25/2022,"Five thousand miles away from Ukraine, Russia’s invasion is bringing long-term questions into close and urgent focus. Concerns about Taiwan’s future have been mounting for years; in January, Beijing’s ambassador to the US said the issue could bring China and America into military conflict. China’s Communist party has regarded the self-ruled democracy as a renegade province since Chiang Kai-shek’s defeated forces fled there at the end of the civil war in 1949; Taiwan has never declared independence for fear of the reaction, but says it is already a sovereign state. China’s leader, Xi Jinping, appears to see unification as part of a personal mission of national rejuvenation. The sight of a small democracy fighting off a major military power (or, from the Sino-Russian perspective, of the west exploiting others to undermine their legitimate interests) is sharpening everyone’s thinking. Mr Xi vowed to realise unification through peaceful means in an important speech last October. Though China is Taiwan’s largest economic partner, the island’s 24 million people have never wanted a “one country, two systems” deal, and events in Hong Kong have shown this to be a non-starter. Building up a clear military advantage – forcing Taipei and Washington to eventually bow to the inevitable, without a clash – would still serve Beijing best. China’s massive expansion of military power, increasingly forceful rhetoric and a record number of fighter jet flights close to the island have rattled nerves. Beijing has also wooed away eight of the 22 countries that still recognised Taiwan diplomatically when Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive party first won the presidency in 2016. Yet the International Institute for Strategic Studies says that last year saw the highest level of support for Taiwan since 1971, when it lost its UN seat. Nancy Pelosi was reportedly due to visit this month, before testing positive for Covid. At stake is not only the future of a vibrant democracy but the risk of global economic fallout (the world is heavily dependent on Taiwan for semiconductors), Japan’s potential vulnerability (Tokyo wants to nearly double its defence spending over the next five years), future control over shipping lanes, and ultimately America’s Pacific power status. Taiwan’s armed forces cannot match Mr Xi’s. The island would be harder to invade and easier to isolate than Ukraine, but the latter’s lessons appear clear: bolster preparations and push for training and arms from elsewhere, with the hope of fending off any invasion for as long as possible. The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 says Washington will provide the arms needed for self-defence. Despite growing doubts over whether the US can be counted on, a switch from “strategic ambiguity” to clarity – as some advocate – over whether it would come to Taiwan’s defence would prompt a major reaction from Beijing and might not enhance deterrence. But Washington and others should increase support for Taiwan in other ways, carefully assessing the best options. Some in Beijing had anticipated that it could easily be seized and cowed, with limited international reaction – assumptions shaken by Ukraine. But the western backlash against Moscow may embolden those who believe that waiting will only allow Taiwan to improve readiness and build support. They will also note that backing for the war is strong in Russia, and that China is far better equipped to withstand economic pressure. The risks of sleepwalking into conflict may well be growing – and Ukraine has demonstrated its terrible cost.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Ukraine and Taiwan: looking for lessons | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/24/the-guardian-view-on-ukraine-and-taiwan-looking-for-lessons
4/25/2022,"Two polar research ship crew members are to become the first same-sex couple to get married in the British Antarctic Territory. Eric Bourne and Stephen Carpenter hope to tie the knot on Monday, although it may be pushed back because of the weather. Bourne and Carpenter have been together for 20 years. They both work on the Royal Research Ship Sir David Attenborough, one of the most advanced polar research ships in the world and one which that came perilously and unforgettably close to being called RSS Boaty McBoatface. The wedding will be performed by the boat’s captain, Will Whatley, at the British Antarctic Survey’s main research station at Rothera on Adelaide Island, a place shared with numerous Adélie penguins and Weddell seals. The pair are experienced seafarers and have travelled the world together on a variety of ships. Carpenter said: “Antarctica is such an incredible place. We have been together for 20 years but now we’ve both been to Antarctica together, it felt like the perfect place for us to finally tie the knot! We’ve even had the coordinates of the wedding location engraved into our rings.” Bourne said they were both very proud to be the first. “BAS is such a welcoming and accepting employer, and we feel very lucky to be able to live and work in such an incredible community and place together.” The BAS said the couple’s big day “will mark a historic step for diversity and inclusion in polar science”. We’re delighted to wish BAS’ Eric Bourne and Stephen Carpenter luck on their upcoming wedding which will be the first same-sex marriage in British Antarctic Territory. Their big day will mark a historic step for diversity and inclusion in polar science ❄️🏳️‍🌈https://t.co/eeFJ9cGK6w pic.twitter.com/qOr7Jn9lOR The marriage will be registered with the British Antarctic Territory (BAT) government, based in the Foreign Office, and the marriage will be valid in the UK. It is the second marriage to take place between BAS staff since BAT law was changed in 2016 to make such events easier. The ceremony is due to be attended by the 30 crew of the RRS Sir David Attenborough, followed by a reception with about 100 staff from the research station. Food will be prepared by the station’s chef and the facility’s resident band will provide the music. The RRS Sir David Attenborough is a £200m research ship that is part of a mission investigating whether warm waters are melting the glaciers and ice shelves of the Antarctic from below. It has a unique “moon pool”, a 4 sq metre vertical shaft that goes right through the ship. The boat was launched on the Mersey, at Birkenhead, in 2018 by Attenborough himself, who said the naming was the “greatest of honours”. Before the boat’s launch a public poll was held to decide a name. More than 32,000 names were put forward including “It’s Bloody Cold Here”, “I Like Big Boats & I Cannot Lie” and “What Iceberg?”. Particularly striking was the name Boaty McBoatface, suggested by the former BBC radio presenter James Hand. It gained 124,109 votes and 33% of the total vote, the biggest number by far. But given the boat is “a serious science ship that required the name of a serious scientist”, the vote was overruled. Instead, a small but very advanced yellow submarine on the Sir David Attenborough carries the name Boaty McBoatface. The weather forecast for Rothera on Monday is a bracing -2C (28F), although it will feel like -7C, the Met Office said. The couple said they were planning a second celebration for family and friends.

4/25/2022,"A British man who was held captive in Yemen without charge or trial for five years has been released from jail. In 2017, Luke Symons, 30, was detained by Houthi rebels at a security checkpoint on suspicion of espionage. On Sunday, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, confirmed Symons “would shortly be reunited with his family”. She thanked Omani and Saudi negotiators as well as UK Foreign Office staff as he was released alongside 13 other foreign nationals in Yemen. Symons, from Cardiff, has longstanding connections to the war-torn country and travelled there in 2012, where he met his wife, Tagreed, a Yemeni national. The couple, who have a young son, attempted to flee the country during the conflict but Symons was stopped at a checkpoint where he was found with a British passport and accused of being a spy, a claim his family strong denies. Amnesty International has long campaigned for his release and was told by his family that he had been beaten by his captors in an attempt to extract a confession and his arm had been broken. The Briton was being held in solitary confinement in a prison in Sana’a, the capital, and told family members the conditions were affecting his physical and mental health. Kevin Brennan, Labour MP for Cardiff West, tweeted that it was “terrific news” that his constituent had finally been released. He added: “Thanks to all at the FCDO [Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office] and most of all to Luke’s family for their tireless campaigning.” Brennan said Symons’ wife and son had left Yemen with him. Truss said: “I am pleased that Luke Symons, who was unlawfully detained, without charge or trial since 2017 in Yemen, has been released. “Luke was 25 when he was unlawfully detained by the Houthis. His son was only a few months old at the time. He was allegedly mistreated, in solitary confinement, and refused visits by his family. “He has been flown to Muscat and soon he will be reunited with his family in the UK. “We thank our Omani and Saudi partners for their support in securing his release. “I pay tribute to our excellent staff for their hard work in returning Luke home.” Symons’ release comes after a two-month truce was implemented in Yemen on 2 April. It is the first nationwide ceasefire in the past six years in the Middle Eastern country’s deadly civil war, which erupted in 2014. That year, Iranian-backed Houthis seized Sana’a and forced the internationally recognised government into exile. A Saudi-led coalition entered the war in early 2015 to try to restore the government to power.",News/World news,British man held for five years in Yemen without charge is freed,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/24/british-man-held-for-five-years-in-yemen-without-charge-is-freed
4/25/2022,"Who is advising Scotland Yard on the political implications of releasing – or not releasing – information on new fixed-penalty notices issued in the period prior to the local elections on 5 May (Police delay Partygate fine updates until after May local elections, 21 April)? There is no requirement in electoral law that prohibits the publication of such information. If the reason for not releasing it is to avoid involvement in the electoral process, this decision will achieve the precise opposite. If Scotland Yard has completed a full investigation and is ready to issue notices, then not do so is to make a political judgment about what information should be available to the electorate. None of this would have arisen but for the dilatory approach of the Metropolitan police in dealing with breaches of lockdown regulations.Gerald CrawleySt Briavels, Gloucestershire  I am disturbed by the Metropolitan police’s decision not to disclose whether further fines have been issued to the prime minister or others until after the local elections. This seems to be depriving the electorate of vital information at exactly the time they need it. I understand the principle of withholding from a jury a defendant’s previous criminal record lest it should influence the verdict, but we aren’t being asked to decide whether the PM is guilty – we are being asked whether we want to vote for the party he leads and for candidates who either support him or can be challenged to denounce him. We don’t get asked for our opinion very frequently; when we do, we need every available fact to enable us to make an informed decision.Kevin NaghtenLondon  It is blindingly obvious to all but, it seems, the acting Metropolitan police commissioner that withholding further information about possible breaches of Covid laws at No 10 until after the forthcoming elections is a blatantly political act. It seems the Met wishes the public to vote in ignorance of possibly criminal behaviour by senior members of this government. At a moment when the Met’s reputation stands at an all-time low, its withholding of truth is an act of self-harm as well as of harm to the body politic. Such apparent political bias is as disturbing as the other more conspicuous offences against democracy by this government referred to by Jonathan Freedland (Every day Boris Johnson clings on, our democracy rots a little bit more, 21 April).Geoffrey LangLondon  In his column (Boris Johnson’s guilt is beyond doubt. There is no way back from this, 21 April), Simon Jenkins asserts that the home secretary, Priti Patel, “should have ordered the police to resolve this matter [the Metropolitan police investigation into Partygate] immediately months ago. It is suspicious that she did not.” The operational independence of the police from government, and police and crime commissioners (PCCs), is a longstanding convention of policing in the UK. It derives from legal judgments and legislation that make chief constables responsible for the “direction and control” of their forces. For the home secretary – or any minister or PCC – to seek to “order” the police to prioritise any investigation would represent gross political interference; it would be unenforceable, and be refused by any self-respecting senior police officer.Tim HigginsonClifton, Bedfordshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

4/25/2022,"I read Keren Levy’s article (Dentists would not treat my toothache – now my health has been wrecked for ever, 20 April) with great interest. I sympathise, having experienced the serious inadequacies of British dental practice for nearly 20 years and the constant excruciating pain that can result from it – not to mention the ongoing systemic issues that completely impact life. To a great extent, British dentistry is taught to pass on the most serious of conditions, especially jawbone infections, which are usually caused by its own practices. This places patients in a cycle of misdiagnosis, unlimited excuses and pitiful nonsense to support this stance. I have experienced this for nearly two decades, and but for the help from two dental surgeons and my GP, who were willing to act where most wouldn’t, it is doubtful that I would be alive today. I still suffer the consequences of this self-protection policy, which condemns so many people to a life of constant pain and ill health. The problem goes right to the heart and to the top of the dental establishment, where the default position is to never treat anything out of the ordinary – or risk being struck off. This risk-aversion policy can be found from the everyday high-street dentist to the bodies that represent practitioners. Such a policy is contrary to all true ethics that should guide our health practitioners, where the overriding policy must be the wellbeing of the patient, not the fear of litigation or being struck off. One unfortunate result of this is that most dental surgeons have little or no experience in treating jawbone infections, and as such readily refer the patient to other practices or institutions, where the merry-go-round of passing the buck can go on for years. The sad thing is that jaw infections are not uncommon and many patients are left in a void of pain and inaction.

It has been getting worse at music gigs for years. After 50 years, and hundreds of gigs, we have decided to retire from gig-going. We are tired of people spoiling what should be an enjoyable experience by using camera phones. You pay good money to see an artist on stage, only for it to be ruined by selfish people raising their screens in your line of vision. Why watch something on a tiny screen when you can live in the moment? Some venues make an effort to stop this selfish behaviour, but many don’t. More musicians should make a stand to stop so-called music fans recording their performances.Barry and Joy NormanDrighlington, West Yorkshire  Several reports recently have mentioned the bad behaviour of audiences at comedy, theatre and so on. As a musician, I have had the opposite experience at the few concerts I have been able to play since lockdown: there has been a deep and concentrated silence from the audience and a notable absence of coughing (hooray), and afterwards I’ve had heartfelt messages from people saying how much they had missed live music.

4/25/2022,"“My mother was in Auschwitz so I couldn’t possibly go for Le Pen,” said Christian Eskenazi after casting his vote at the Lycée Charles de Gaulle in South Kensington. The retired former chief sommelier at the Garrick Club said he had no choice but to back Emmanuel Macron for a second term. “I find him too arrogant, but I’m pro-European and anti-Le Pen so I had to go for him. It was not a vote for a politician, it was a vote against an idea.” Eskenazi added: “My mother survived Auschwitz but she saw her mother and father die there. She spent her life visiting schools as a witness against racism and xenophobia. She warned of the dangers of voting for the far right and the danger is still there.” Eskenazi, one of 116,595 French voters registered in the UK, is hoping that his fellow citizens will put up an electoral “barrage to stop Le Pen”. There was no sign of any support for Le Pen among London voters. After speaking to dozens of voters for three hours, the Guardian could not find a single voter for the far-right candidate. Jada Odero, a politics and history student at Manchester University, was affronted to be asked how she voted. “Of course there are no Le Pen supporters,” she said, “we’re in multicultural London and she’s just against that.” In 2017, Macron won 95% of the London French vote against Le Pen, after winning 51.4% in the first round. This time he could do even better here after winning 55% of first round preferences. Meanwhile, Le Pen came a distant seventh in the first round with only 2.63% across the UK. But Odero is anxious that in France, Le Pen’s popularity is on the rise. She said: “It won’t happen this time, but her stats are getting higher – people seem to be getting more and more ignorant.” Benjamin Fourmond, a London IT worker from Blois, agreed. “If anybody voted Le Pen here they probably wouldn’t tell you. I’m more worried about Le Pen winning in five years’ time, because Macron won’t be able to run then and she’ll still be around and that’s really scary.” Fourmond voted for the Green candidate, Yannick Jadot, in the first round. He said: “I don’t think Macron has done much for the environment. But he chose not to do anything about nuclear power stations, which in retrospect was probably a good move.” In the first round more than one in five UK-based French expats voted for the left-wing candidate, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who only narrowly missed making it to the final two. Among them was marketing director Michel Lieke, who said he was drawn to Mélenchon’s promise to write off debts owed by African nations to France. On Sunday he voted for Macron to block Le Pen. “Working and paying taxes for anyone from an immigrant background is not going to be as straightforward if Le Pen wins.” Dual national sisters Manon, 21, and Léa Kilvington, 18, from Chertsey in Surrey were excited to be voting for the first time. Manon said: “I’ve been hearing that a lot of young people support Le Pen in France. There’s no way that we can let Le Pen get to power, so we wanted to make the effort to come out and vote.” Fatmire Bega-Shala, a French teacher in Feltham, also turned out to block Le Pen after troubling memories of her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen. She said: “My family is originally from Kosovo and growing up in France in the late 70s and 80s it was quite frightening to hear about Le Pen and the National Front. We were trying to be part of the society and he wasn’t welcoming. It is now important to stop his daughter.” Some of the voters emerging from the Lycée polling station were more positive about Macron. French teacher Michelle Pickard said: “The first priority is to block Le Pen, but I quite approve of Macron’s policy, and he is a true European and I am too. If he wins it will be a small victory, and he will have to take on board all these voters who are not happy with him.” Francesca Beausang, a City economist, closely allied herself with Macron. Peering from behind Chanel sunglasses she said: “Macron fits with my personal values. In 2017 I bought into the whole centrist argument he presented. And he did quite well in terms of managing Covid. He also did well in the debate whereas Le Pen struck me as absolutely venomous.” “No one in their right mind buys that she’s any different from her father.” Laurence Bemsafi, who also works in finance in the City, said Macron is popular in London because he is both pro-business and for social justice. She said: “I think he’ll be fine and I try not to think about the worst.”",News/World news,French in London feel they have little choice but to choose Macron,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/24/french-in-london-feel-they-have-little-choice-but-to-choose-macron
4/25/2022,"My aunt, Audrey Enstone, who has died aged 91, survived a series of horrifying “treatments” in her 20s aimed at curing her obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Described by her as the “lost years”, for almost a decade she was detained in a psychiatric hospital, where she was subjected first to electro-convulsive therapy then deep insulin-induced coma treatment, followed by a lobotomy. Eventually, however, she took part in talking therapy trials, which are psychological treatments for mental and emotional problems. With support she was able to devise a series of strategies for living with OCD, and once discharged from hospital she worked for the Royal National Institute for the Blind (RNIB) for many years. Trained as a braillist, she could read braille by eye, and was engaged in proofreading German, French and Russian books for translation. Audrey was born in Wimbledon, south-west London, to Ethel (nee Mathieson) and Herbert Harris, who worked in the foreign correspondence department of Midland bank. Academically driven at Rosebery grammar school for girls in Epsom, Surrey, had it not been for the OCD and hospitalisation, she would doubtless have gone to university. During a short first marriage in 1959 to Paul Curtiss, Audrey gave birth to a daughter, Ruth, but the baby was put up for adoption as social services considered Audrey would be unable to care for her. It brought Audrey huge joy when, as an adult, Ruth got in touch and she was welcomed back into the family. Audrey once told me that although the lobotomy had no effect on her OCD, it did cure her extreme shyness. At the RNIB she met David Hardy, a fellow braille proofer, and they married in 1968, enjoying a social life filled with music and dancing until their divorce in 1979. She wrote plays and poems for family and friends, plus a yearly panto for staff at the RNIB before it moved her section from London to Peterborough and she took early retirement in 1989. Remarkably, Audrey rarely expressed bitterness for the brutal treatments she had received as a young woman. For her nieces she was the lively, idiosyncratic and engaging soul of every family celebration. A third marriage, to Eric Enstone in 1980, ended in divorce in 1989. She is survived by Ruth and her nieces, Sally, Helen, Jill and me.",News/Society,Audrey Enstone obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/24/audrey-enstone-obituary
