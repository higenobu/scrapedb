4/20/2022,"A US congressman has urged the Biden administration to ban six British lawyers from entering the US amid accusations that the lawyers have “enabled” “Putin’s” oligarchs by engaging in “abusive” lawsuits against journalists as part of an alleged effort to silence them. Steve Cohen, a Democratic congressman from Tennessee, said in a letter to US secretary of state Antony Blinken that the US needed to begin establishing “deterrents” against lawyers who he accused of performing “unscrupulous work” that ultimately undermined democratic values. “Despite our close ties with the United Kingdom, the nature of its libel laws and the vast amount of blood money in its financial system make it an ideal place for oligarchs to abuse the law to harass and intimidate,” Cohen wrote. He also cc’ed US attorney general Merrick Garland. Most of the six lawyers named by Cohen have represented Russian interests who have pursued legal action against journalists, publishers and authors in the UK in connection to their reporting on Russia-related matters. Four lawyers named in the letter were involved in legal action against Catherine Belton, a former journalist at the Financial Times, and her publisher HarperCollins, who were sued following the publication of her book, Putin’s People. The lawyers include: Nigel Tait of Carter-Ruck, John Kelly of Harbottle & Lewis, Hugh Tomlinson, and Geraldine Proudler of CMS. A letter published by 19 free press organisations last November expressed “serious concern” at the legal proceedings, which were brought at the time by the now-sanctioned Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, Rosneft, the Russian energy company, and three other Russian billionaires. The organisations said they believed the cases against Belton and HarperCollins were so-called Slapps, a “form of legal harassment used by wealthy and powerful entities to silence journalists”. Belton’s publishers HarperCollins settled the claims, agreeing to make a number of changes to the text. Keith Schilling of Schillings was accused in Cohen’s letter of being “well known for bringing abusive suits against journalists” and working “tirelessly” to protect the Malaysian fugitive Jho Low, who has been accused by US prosecutors of running a money laundering scheme in connection to the Malaysian state investment fund 1MDB. Another lawyer, Shlomo Rechtschaffen, who is representing Walter Soriano – who was accused by Cohen of being an “enabler” of Oleg Deripaska, Abramovich and Dmitry Rybolovlev - has according to Cohen filed an allegedly “abusive “ lawsuit against American journalist Scott Stedman. Cohen said the visa denials could be implemented under a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act which calls for “anti-kleptocracy and human rights bans”, and that ideally the bans would be made public. All of the lawyers named in Cohen’s letter responded to the Guardian’s request for comment on the allegations set out by the congressman. A spokesperson for Carter-Ruck said the claims by Cohen against the firm were “misconceived and are rejected entirely”. “In addition to other matters, we are not working for any Russian individuals, companies or entities seeking to challenge, overturn, frustrate or minimise sanctions. We have never acted for Russian individuals, companies or entities seeking to challenge sanctions,” the spokesperson said, adding that Carter-Ruck condemned the Russian government’s decision to invade Ukraine and said the firm would not be acting for any individual or company associated with the Putin regime. A spokesperson for Harbottle & Lewis, where Kelly is a litigator specialised in “reputation protection, privacy and defamation”, said in a statement that the firm has acted at all times in accordance with its professional and legal obligations and takes these matters very seriously. Harbottle & Lewis added in connection to litigation involving Belton’s Putin’s People: “The firm has not engaged in an abusive lawsuit as alleged, and there was no such suggestion made when the proceedings were considered by a high court judge who reviewed the book and ruled that it contained a number of defamatory allegations. As such there is no basis for any such steps to be taken.” A representative for Tomlinson said: “Regulatory rules for lawyers are very strict and work to ensure equal entitlement to independent legal advice. Mr Tomlinson acted properly and in accordance with those rules throughout and has never acted as Mr Cohen suggests. There is therefore no proper basis for Mr Cohen’s request.” A spokesperson for Proudler’s firm, CMS, said it “strongly rejected” allegations of impropriety against CMS and Proudler. “We have reviewed the steps taken in our media litigation practice and are confident that these were compliant with all professional regulations as well as our wider responsibilities at the time.” The spokesperson added that CMS has, since the invasion of Ukraine, not accepted new instructions from Russia-based entities or individuals with connections to the Russian government. Proudler resigned last month from both the board of the Guardian Foundation, the charitable arm of the media group’s parent company, as well as from the Scott Trust review panel, which adjudicates editorial complaints. A spokesperson for Schilling said the firm was not acting for any “sanctioned entities” and that it hoped sanctions would foreshorten the war in Ukraine. “We do not comment on client matters and indeed are not permitted to do so, but we fail to see how any representation of the Malaysian national named by Congressman Cohen could in any circumstances support the (in any event wholly misplaced) allegations that we are acting in the manner alleged in relation to Russian ‘oligarchs’,” the spokesperson said, adding that there was “no basis for any allegations that we have in any way behaved other than in the highest traditions of the legal profession in upholding the rule of law”. Rechtschaffen, who is representing Soriano in a case against Stedman, claimed he did not work for an oligarch or an enabler of an oligarch, and claimed that his case against Stedman was not abusive and not a case of “libel tourism” or any other abuse of process. In an letter published in February 2022, 15 free press organisations, including Index on Censorship, the Daphne Caruana Galizia Foundation, English PEN, and Reporters without Borders, argued that the case against Stedman “has many of the hallmarks of a Slapp”. The letter said Stedman’s website, Forensic News, had published six articles and a podcast about Soriano, a British-Israeli security consultant, after he had been summoned by the US Senate intelligence committee. The letter said all the defendants in the case were based in the US, but that the lawsuit had been brought in London. Soriano was born in Argentina, and immigrated to Israel before moving to London. The US letter comes as British MPs are engaged in a similar debate about “intimidation lawsuits”, with some arguing that expunging London’s alleged “dirty money” problem would require that oligarchs of any nation were not allowed to use the English legal system to silence free speech. Last month, MPs in the UK accused three of the lawyers named in Cohen’s letter – Proudler, Tait and Kelly – of deliberately filing oppressive legal actions against an investigative journalist in an attempt to intimidate her. Similar allegations were also made against Tomlinson. They all denied the allegations. Arabella Pike, HarperCollins’ publishing director, said in a tweet that she applauded the Cohen letter. Belton declined to comment on the Cohen letter but in recent testimony before the House of Commons said it was clear that a lot of journalists had faced “a barrage of threats and intimidation, and our democracy has been so much poorer for it” because the public had not been able to learn properly about the background of oligarchs until recently. “The entire population should have known the story about how Roman Abramovich won his fortune, but they had been deprived of that until now,” she said.",News/US news,US congressman urges Biden to ban six UK lawyers for ‘enabling’ oligarchs,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/19/us-congressman-urges-biden-to-ban-six-uk-lawyers-for-enabling-oligarchs
4/20/2022,"On any other day, the sight of Theresa May telling Priti Patel that her Rwanda immigration environment was too hostile even for her would have been parliamentary box office. But, as it was, most eyes were on the prime minister’s Partygate apology that followed the home secretary’s statement. It was certainly a three-line whip for the cabinet. Patel was joined by Liz Truss, Dominic Raab and Nadine Dorries nice and early in an enforced show of support. And just after 5pm, Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak filed in to take centre stage. They could have been mistaken for defendants in a court were it not for the fact they had both already been found guilty. The Convict began by saying he wanted to make a full apology. Which would have sounded more convincing if he hadn’t already made several apologies to the Commons on previous outings. Each time hoping to draw a line under whatever he had done wrong – or more importantly been found out to have done wrong. But if practice doesn’t make perfect, it certainly makes Johnson a slightly better apologiser. In the past he has never really sounded that sorry for anything – rather just irritable that he had got himself into yet another situation where he was obliged to apologise. Now though, he did sound a little bit sorry. Mostly for having been caught. But that was a start. He at least managed to cut out the trademark smirks. Baby steps towards true repentance and all that. And given that he’s likely to have to come to the house several more times in the future to apologise for more egregious breaches of the law, he’s still got plenty of time to sharpen up his act. Who knows, come the end he might even sound almost sincere. It’s a thought. Not that anyone is holding their breath. Mainly because the basis of his apology is so flimsy. Saying you’re sorry for not knowing a law that you’ve been on TV countless times telling people they will be in deep shit if they break, is too feeble even for a recidivist up on a shoplifting charge at Snaresbrook crown court. It’s not about the cake. It’s not even about the booze. Though they sure as hell make it look a whole lot worse. It’s about the fact that the Convict never thought for a minute that the rules limiting social gatherings applied to him or his crew. He understood how angry and disappointed people were, he said. And the country had deserved better from him. Nearly there, Boris. What he should have said was that the country deserved better than him. But he wanted to make it up to everyone. So much so that he wished he’d done far worse, as then there would be more to repay. At least that was the implication. No worries there then. There’s worse coming down the track and the Convict knows it. Much worse. But hopefully if he looked busy in Ukraine then the country would forgive him. Some hope. Keir Starmer was not in the mood to forgive or forget. This was his strongest and most powerful Commons performance in months. The Tory MPs who had turned up to boost Johnson by interrupting and causing trouble fell silent. They could sense they were outclassed and outgunned. It always helps when you have the force of Good on your side. The Convict was a joke. No one could believe a word he said. Worst of all, Johnson knew he was dishonest. Starmer was so forceful it took the Speaker a few seconds to remember to ask him to withdraw the word dishonest. Which he did. But the damage was done. For a second the Convict had allowed himself a rare glimpse into his own soul and been revolted by what he had seen. He turned pale, not even bothering to look around in a fake display of bravado. It was a moment once seen, that could not be unseen. Deep down Johnson knows he’s a liar and a fraud. He won’t resign because that’s not his style. But something inside him has been broken. He’s no longer funny. No longer clever. Just a pathetic nobody, desperately clinging to power. The Labour leader then turned his attention to Sunak. The chancellor’s career was in flames. Burnt, as so many before, by flying too close to Johnson. If anything, Sunak looked even more pathetic than Johnson. The minister rendered into a glove puppet. He knows the game is up. The sooner he gets out of parliament and back to his tax haven the happier he will be. Starmer then talked of others who had obeyed the law. Even in death. So if it was all the same to Johnson, now was not the time to be deflected by Ukraine. Just resign, prime minister. Even so, almost all Tory MPs managed to come out in the Convict’s support. But their words were meaningless. These weren’t the Tory A-listers who you would want on your side, they were the nodding donkeys. The vain and the stupid who will say almost anything that’s put in front of them. Fools like Edward Leigh and Michael Fabricant. Imagine the shame of having them on your side. Only Mark Haper had the guts to say it was time for the prime minister to take a hike. Meanwhile opposition MPs queued up to tell Johnson enough was enough. How come he had understood the rules enough to accept Allegra Stratton’s resignation when her only crime was joking about covering up the parties? If that wasn’t an admission that even now, in the face of multiple apologies, he was still lying through his teeth. Not the Lion of Kyiv so much as the Lying of Kyiv. And what was he planning to do about the other more serious offences that were in the pipeline? Would he be coming back with yet more apologies. Thirty-one minutes in and the Convict briefly lost it, allowing his anger to the fore. Anger at his humiliation. Then he retreated back into mumbled “sorries” and then silence. Judgment was uncomfortably close to hand.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson’s flimsy and feeble Partygate apology to MPs | John Crace,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2022/apr/19/boris-johnsons-flimsy-and-feeble-partygate-apology-to-mps
4/20/2022,"Relatives of a British man who was taken prisoner while serving with the Ukrainian marines have spoken of their distress at seeing him paraded in front of cameras by his Russian captors. Aiden Aslin’s family said he had been a legitimate combatant with the Ukrainian armed forces, and was speaking under duress during an interview posted online this week that was described as a breach of the Geneva conventions. “Aiden is a much-loved young man with a strong network of friends around him and a loving wife-to-be. In this difficult time, we urge you to respect the privacy of our family,” his relatives said. Images of Aslin in handcuffs appeared last week shortly after he had indicated via his social media accounts, which are controlled by a third party, that he had no choice but to surrender because the unit he was serving with inside the besieged city of Mariupol had run out of food and ammunition. This week, a 45-minute film was released online, during which he was questioned by Graham William Phillips, a British man who has previously worked for the Kremlin-backed television channel RT and been accused of spreading Moscow’s propaganda. During the film, Aslin answers no when asked several times if he is speaking under duress. Questioned by Phillips, he recounts his time with the Ukrainian military and, at his interviewer’s prompting, repeats several of Moscow’s propaganda lines, including that he is a mercenary and not, therefore, a legitimate combatant. “The video of Aiden speaking under duress and having clearly suffered physical injuries is deeply distressing,” a statement from his family released on Tuesday said. “Using images and videos of prisoners of war is in contravention of the Geneva convention and must stop. “Together with the family of Shaun Pinner, we are in contact with the Foreign Office to ensure the Russian authorities meet their obligations to prisoners of war under international law and, ultimately, to secure the release of Aiden and Sean,” they said, referring to a second British soldier captured in Ukraine. The statement added: “In 2018, Aiden moved to Ukraine, where he met his girlfriend and eventually settled down in Mykolaiv. Aiden decided to join the Ukrainian marines and has served in his unit for nearly four years. He is not, contrary to the Kremlin’s propaganda, a volunteer, a mercenary or a spy. Aiden was making plans for his future outside the military but, like all Ukrainians, his life was turned upside down by Putin’s barbarous invasion. He has played his part in defending Ukraine’s right to self-determination.” Boris Johnson’s official spokesperson said on Tuesday the government would “provide whatever support we can”, when asked about the fates of British nationals held by Moscow’s forces. “We would call on Russia and Putin to treat any prisoners of war properly, in line with all war conventions and laws.” Asked about attempts to use the captured men for propaganda purposes, the spokesperson said: “We’ve seen Putin’s regime use captured prisoners and soldiers in this way, but we must not be swayed by any attempt to spread disinformation or to distract from who is responsible.” Aslin’s local MP, Robert Jenrick, added: “The misuse of Aiden Aslin by the Russian government for propaganda purposes, including featuring him in videos clearly filmed under duress, is a disgraceful and flagrant breach of the Geneva convention. Russia must desist from this illegal behaviour immediately and treat Aiden appropriately.” He also called on online platforms to live up to their “responsibility to take down prisoner of war-related content from their sites”. He said: “I urge YouTube to remove the grotesque video of Aiden Aslin immediately. Aiden’s family and I are working with the Foreign Office to ensure his swift and safe release.”",News/World news,Family of captive Briton tell of distress at seeing him on Russian TV,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/19/family-captive-briton-aiden-aslin-distress-russian-tv
4/20/2022,"Theresa May has questioned the “legality, practicality and efficacy” of ministers’ plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda amid demands from MPs that the government should disclose the cost of the scheme. The former prime minister, who devised the “hostile environment” policy, warned on Tuesday that the plan to fly those who arrive by unauthorised means to the African country could lead to an increase in the trafficking of women and children. The claim came as Priti Patel, the home secretary, came under repeated demands in the Commons to explain how much the scheme, announced last week while parliament was in recess, would cost. The UK government has said it will pay an initial £120m to the Rwandan government, but will have to pay additional costs for housing, food and travel. May, who has been blamed in part for the Windrush scandal while home secretary, questioned whether the policy was within the law. “I do not support the removal to Rwanda policy on the grounds of legality, practicality and efficacy,” she said. The former Conservative party leader asked whether reports were correct in claiming that families will not be broken up by the government as it seeks to send people to Rwanda. “Where is her evidence that this will not simply lead to an increase in the trafficking of women and children?” May said. Patel did not clarify whether women and children would be sent to Rwanda but insisted the policy was legal and was needed to tackle smuggling gangs who “effectively exploit various loopholes in our existing laws”. Andrew Mitchell, the former Tory international development secretary, was one of a series of backbenchers who joined opposition MPs in expressing concerns at the policy, saying it “will simply not work”. Patel refused to directly answer MPs’ questions on whether there was a cap on the cost of each person forcibly deported, on top of the £120m economic deal with Rwanda. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, told MPs that the government was looking for help from Rwanda because Home Office decision-making had “totally collapsed”. “On [Patel’s] watch, the Home Office are only taking 14,000 initial asylum decisions a year. That is half what they were doing five years ago. “So, the costs of the UK taxpayer have soared by hundreds of millions of pounds because she isn’t capable of taking the basic asylum decisions. And because she’s not capable of taking those decisions, she is trying to pay Rwanda to take those decisions instead,” she said. The Scottish National party’s home affairs spokesperson Stuart McDonald, said Patel’s policy would not hurt smugglers but would harm people who had fled persecution. “Her government has completely failed to stop abuses in UK detention centres, never mind centres that are 5,000 miles away. “In short, this disastrous policy has nothing to do with the global migration crisis, it is everything to do with distracting from the PM’s political crises,” he told MPs. Patel said the final comment was “absolutely unacceptable” and accused opposition MPs of “playing party political games”. She urged the House of Lords, which has rejected the nationality and borders bill twice, to accept it. “Once again [I] urge the ‘other place’ to follow this elected House in backing the bill,” she said. Labour’s Dame Diana Johnson, who chairs the home affairs select committee, asked: “Who would actually be eligible to be sent to Rwanda? Is it going to be single young men, is it going to be women and children?” Patel replied: “Everyone considered for relocation will be screened, interviewed and have the right access to legal advice and services.” Patel told the Commons that a reported objection from Matthew Rycroft, her permanent secretary, was not evidence that he opposed her plans. “He stated, in his role as accounting officer, that the policy is regular, proper and feasible, but that there is not currently sufficient evidence to demonstrate value for money,” she claimed. In an exchange of letters with Patel, Rycroft wrote: “I do not believe sufficient evidence can be obtained to demonstrate that the policy will have a deterrent effect significant enough to make the policy value for money.” Last year, more than 28,000 migrants and refugees made the crossing from mainland Europe to Britain, a fraction of the number arriving in other European countries.",News/Politics,Theresa May questions ‘legality and practicality’ of Rwanda asylum plan,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/19/theresa-may-questions-legality-and-practicality-of-rwanda-asylum-plan
