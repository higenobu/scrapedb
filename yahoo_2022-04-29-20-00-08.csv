4/29/2022,"Elon Musk bought his first private jet, the Dassault Falcon 900B, in 2004. Musk bought the jet before he became a billionaire in 2012. The French-made jet typically costs around $26 million. The Falcon 900 is a business jet first produced by French aviation company Dassault in the 1980s. The Falcon 900B, a version of the jet with Honeywell TFE731-5BR-1C engines, was delivered to Musk in 2004. Musk bought the jet before he became a billionaire in 2012. Musk's jet was previously registered to other companies including MLM company Amway, per registration records compiled by online database PlaneLogger. This indicates that Musk likely bought a pre-owned jet. Musk's Falcon 900B is under the registration N900SX. Musk's jet was last seen in active use in 2016, according to PlaneLogger's database. In an interview with Chris Anderson at the TED Conference in April, Musk said he doesn't own a home, a yacht, or take vacations. ""I mean, the one exception is the plane, but if I don't use the plane then I have less hours to work,"" Musk said. The plane he's referring to is his Gulfstream G650ER, in which he flew more than 150,000 miles in 2018 alone, per flight records obtained by The Washington Post. Only four jets have been registered to Musk and Tesla in addition to the Falcon 900B: a Gulfstream G650ER (N628TS) and two Gulfstream G550 (N272BG and N502SX). Musk and Tesla did not immediately reply to Insider's requests for comment. A new Dassault Falcon costs $26 million, while a pre-owned jet costs $5 million. The Falcon 900B was last manufactured in 2000 and has a fleet size of 156. The jet costs $26 million when deliveries first began in 1985, and costs $5 million if bought pre-owned in recent years. While the 900B is no longer being manufactured, the latest variant of the original Falcon 900 — the 900LX — is still in production. The jet costs around $2 million to operate if flown for 450 hours a year. The interior has remained the same since it was first produced in the 1980s, according to Business Jet Traveler. Although the jet is much older than popular business jets like the Gulfstream G650, the Falcon 900's design has been described as ""way ahead of its time."" The variants, especially the 900B, are a popular choice in the pre-owned jet market. They are much easier to refurbish and maintain than other older aircraft, per Business Jet News. The 33-foot-long jet can accommodate up to 14 passengers and three crew, per Business Jet Traveler. A traditional cabin layout has a galley, four large executive seats, and four narrower seats, per the publication. A virtual tour of the 900LX shows a small galley with metal and wooden accents. There are 24 windows on the jet. The leather seats recline and feature adjustable footrests. Wooden tables are stowed at the sides of the plane, with seats typically facing each other. Adjustable screens provide entertainment onboard. The cabin has multiple storage compartments beside the seats. The plane has a shared dining space. The jet can be customized to accommodate four seats facing each other in pairs. The rear end of the plane can be converted into a private stateroom, per Business Jet Traveler. The jet's rear end can be customized into a private cabin with a bed (pictured above). The bed is usually converted from a divan-style sofa, per Business Jet Traveler. The stateroom is outfitted with a television screen, the virtual tour of the 900LX shows. Towards the back of the plane is a heated luggage compartment.

4/29/2022,"TOKYO (AP) — The head of the company that operated a tourist boat that sank off northern Japan with 26 people aboard said Wednesday he approved the trip despite a broken communication device and forecasts of rough weather, as officials investigated previous accidents involving the company. The sightseeing boat Kazu 1 with two crew was taking 24 passengers, including two children, on a scenic tour of Shiretoko National Park on the northeastern side of Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost main island, when it sent a distress call Saturday afternoon saying it was sinking. The area, near Kashuni Waterfall, is a difficult place to maneuver because of its rocky coastline and strong tide. Rescuers on Sunday located 11 bodies, including that of a 3-year-old girl, but have not found the boat. Experts say the missing people may have been trapped inside the vessel. Seiichi Katsurada, president of the tour boat company, knelt on the floor at a news conference to apologize. “We caused a disastrous accident, and I’m very sorry,” he said. He said he approved the captain’s plan to proceed with the tour despite predictions of 3-meter (10-foot) waves in the afternoon, because waters at their home port were calm in the morning. He said the tour plan could be changed by the captain if the weather worsened. “Looking back, it was the wrong decision,” he said. Katsurada said a wireless device at the company’s office was broken and the boat lacked a satellite phone, making communications between the vessel and the company difficult. But he said he thought the captain could use his cellphone and that staff of other boat operators could help with communications. However, the boat was alone on Saturday afternoon because local fishermen canceled their operations because of the high wind and wave warnings, while the three other cruise companies hadn't started their season yet. The Transport Ministry said the boat’s operator, Shiretoko Pleasure Cruiser, had two accidents last year, including one that involved the captain of the sunken boat, Noriyuki Toyoda. The ministry said it is looking into the company's safety standards and its decision to go ahead with the tour despite the expected rough weather. The coast guard said it is gathering evidence of suspected professional negligence in the accident. Witnesses say ownership of the company changed and most of its veteran crewmembers resigned. Katsurada said he took over the company from a relative five years ago and used to have up to a dozen crew, but now has only a few captains and deck crew including Toyoda, who was previously an amphibious vehicle driver and was still new to the tricky Shiretoko coast. Koya Sugawara, head of Dolphin, another tour boat operator, said the Shiretoko waters require a difficult maneuver by boats as they approach the rocky coastline while avoiding salmon fish nets. He told NHK public television that Katsurada's company often ignored a cooperation agreement among the four local tour companies for safety and operated alone. An employee of another tour boat company who communicated from his office by radio with the Kazu 1 as it began having trouble described growing panic. At first, the captain, Toyoda, calmly said his boat was near the waterfall and his return to port would be delayed, the employee told the Asahi newspaper. About 10 minutes later, the captain desperately ordered the other crewmember to ""Get everyone to put on a life jacket!” Toyoda then said the boat was taking on water and might sink and its engine had stalled, and the employee said he made an emergency call to the coast guard to request a rescue.",World/Associated Press,Operator of sunken Japanese tour boat had previous accidents,https://news.yahoo.com/operator-sunken-japanese-tour-boat-135907857.html
4/29/2022,"China has slammed Australia for opposing its security pact with Solomon Islands, calling it a colonialist myth-driven violation of sovereignty and saying Canberra had no right to lay down any ""red line"". This came as Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said a Chinese military base in the South Pacific nation would be a ""red line"" for his government, days after Beijing and Honiara confirmed the signing of the deal without revealing details. Talk of China building a naval base on Solomon Islands was ""purely fake news"", Chinese defence ministry spokesman Tan Kefei said on Thursday, accusing the Australian government and media of intentionally distorting facts and creating tension. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Cooperation under the new security pact would involve ""maintaining social order, protecting people's lives and property, humanitarian assistance [and] natural disaster responses"", Tan reiterated. Addressing an online event with Pacific Island nations the same day, China's vice foreign minister Xie Feng said negotiating and signing a framework security cooperation agreement was ""the sacred right of two sovereign countries"" in line with international laws and norms, and no one had the right to point fingers at China. ""On what grounds can Australia draw a 'red line' for Solomon Islands, 2,000km [1,200 miles] away, and China, 10,000km away? If not an infringement of another country's sovereignty, interference in another country's internal affairs and a breach of international rules, what is this?"" Xie said Australia's stance amounted to ""disinformation, defamation, coercion and intimidation"", and proof that it was still ""obsessed with colonialist myths, exercising coercive diplomacy, trying hard to control the Pacific islands to maintain a so-called sphere of influence"". ""The Pacific is the common home of regional countries, not someone's 'backyard' or 'turf', and should be a stage for international cooperation, not a chessboard for geopolitical games,"" he declared. The China-Solomon security agreement is ""open and transparent [and] not targeted at third parties,"" Xie told a virtual event launching a cooperation centre on climate change for China and Pacific Island countries, in the eastern Chinese province of Shandong. He said China understood the climate change challenges facing the island nations and was willing to provide help ""as a good friend, partner and brother."" Attending the event virtually were officials from Solomon Islands, Kiribati, Niue, Samoa, Tonga, Micronesia, Kiribati, Fiji and Vanuatu.

Photo: AFP> ""China has no selfish interest in developing relations and cooperation with Pacific Island countries,"" Xie asserted. ""[It] does not seek 'spheres of influence' or engage in bullying and coercion but is always a constructive force for peace and development."" Since being announced last week, the China-Solomon Islands security pact has sparked strong concerns from the United States and its Pacific allies. The White House sent a high-level delegation to Honiara to warn Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare of unspecified action against his country. US ally Japan on Monday also dispatched a foreign vice-minister, saying the deal with Beijing could affect the security of the entire Asia-Pacific region, while fellow Pacific nation New Zealand has also questioned whether it will destabilise the region. Australia, which is the Solomons' biggest aid donor and has security ties with it, reacted even more strongly. It had tried to pressure Sogavare into not signing the deal when the news first broke in March. And while Morrison has reiterated his opposition to a Chinese naval base, other politicians have presented even stronger rhetoric on the impact of the deal on Australia's national security. Sogavare has sought to reassure all that a Chinese base was not in the offing, urging critics to respect his country's sovereign interests and said that traditional partners, such as Australia and New Zealand, remained important.

4/29/2022,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Solomon Islands signed a security pact with China because a similar deal with Australia was inadequate, Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said, adding his country knew the cost of war and would not be part of any militarisation of the Pacific. Addressing parliament on Friday, Sogavare made his first public comments since talks with White House Indo-Pacific coordinator Kurt Campbell, who visited Hoinara days after the security pact with China was announced. China's attempts to extend its military influence in the Pacific have put Western allies on guard, and the security pact with the Solomons has roiled the Australian election campaign. While details of the pact with China have not been disclosed, Sogavare has ruled out a military base and said it covers domestic policing. Sogavare said on Friday the security agreement with China was needed because an agreement with traditional partner Australia was ""inadequate"". Opposition parties have criticised the government's secrecy over the terms of the pact with Beijing, and Western allies are concerned that it could provide a gateway for a Chinese military presence. Australia and New Zealand have warned the pact could upset long standing regional security cooperation. Sogavare said Campbell and a separate Japanese delegation had warned him against allowing China to build a naval base because it was not in the region's interests. Sogavare, who has previously said that there were no such plans, said he agreed with the delegations. ""We don't need to be reminded of the cost of war,"" Sogavare told parliament. He said the Solomon Islands would never accept the militarisation of the Pacific after what it experienced in World War Two, and criticised the United States for failing to include the islands in funding for post-war reconstruction. Campbell had agreed to speed up the removal of unexploded World War Two ordnance, Sogavare said. Echoing comments made by China's foreign ministry, Sogavare also criticised Australia's signing of the AUKUS defence alliance with the United States and Britain last year without consulting Pacific island nations. ""The AUKUS treaty will see nuclear submarines in Pacific waters. I learnt of the AUKUS treaty in the media. One would expect that as a member of the Pacific family, Solomon Islands... would have been consulted."" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters on Friday he spoke to Sogavare the day after the announcement of AUKUS and he had not raised any objections.
