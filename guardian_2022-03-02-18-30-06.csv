3/2/2022,"The UK defence secretary has once again ruled out a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying it would be counterproductive. However he warned there was a risk Vladimir Putin would start to “ruthlessly pummel” cities from the air. Ben Wallace rejected calls from Ukraine for a no-fly zone because it would “lead to a war against Russia across the whole of Europe”. He also said it would stop Ukrainian pilots being able to target Russia from the air, giving an advantage to Moscow, which has stronger ground troops and tanks. “If you had a no-fly zone in Ukraine, the overwhelming scale of the Russian army would be able to drive around with impunity, which it can’t at the moment,” the defence secretary told Sky News. Wallace said a convoy of Russian tanks heading towards Kyiv was moving so slowly because of logistical problems and low morale. However, he said the faltering progress of troops could lead to more aerial bombardment from Russia, and there was a risk of Putin’s “brutality increasing” as his efforts were stalling. “The Russians are considerably behind their schedule by days not hours, and that leads to stresses on their logistical supply chains,” he told BBC Breakfast. “That’s why you have seen some of these columns fairly grind to a halt. They have also been surprised by the strength of the Ukrainian resistance.” He said “none of the major cities have been taken control of”, adding that there was “huge amounts of low morale in the Russian forces, we’ve seen lots of surrenders”. “But that doesn’t take away from the fact you have a very ruthless Russian armed forces leadership and a president who seems to know no limit to how much violence they will use to achieve their aims.” Wallace said that meant a plan to “carpet-bomb cities, indiscriminately in some cases” and that siege tactics were in the Russian military doctrine, with forces surrounding a city before they “bombard it indiscriminately and then eventually close in on a population that they hope to have broken, and indeed take over what’s left of the city”. Wallace later told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “What you have seen is the Russian pause on the outskirts and then ruthlessly pummel these cities with artillery and then hope to break the city.” But he said Russia would face “years of resistance” if it sought to occupy Ukraine. Russian troops have entered Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, after days of intensive bombardment, but Wallace said Putin’s forces did not yet control it. The Ministry of Defence said the latest intelligence suggested Russian forces appeared to have moved into the centre of Kherson in south Ukraine. Airstrikes have targeted parts of Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mariupol and Chernihiv. The west has repeatedly rebuffed calls for a no-fly-zone across Ukraine. Boris Johnson on Tuesday told a Ukrainian campaigner in Poland that it was not an option as it could lead to escalation between Russia and Nato. Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, told the prime minister: “Ukrainian people are desperately asking for the rights to protect our sky, we are asking for a no-fly zone. “What’s the alternative for the no-fly zone? Nato is not willing to defend because Nato is afraid of world war three, but it’s already started and it’s Ukrainian children who are there taking the hit.”",News/Politics,UK defence secretary rejects calls from Ukraine for no-fly zone,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/02/uk-defence-secretary-ukraine-russia-no-fly-zone-ben-wallace
3/2/2022,"For Richmond local Rob Buchanan, the only winners from the downpour hitting his already drenched lowland property north-west of Sydney are “ducks and grass”. During the devastating floods in 2021, the water was 4 metres high in surrounding paddocks, and Buchanan and his partner, Sam Magnusson, were taking their tinnie to the pub for dinner. This year, though, he fears it will be worse. At about 4pm on Wednesday, a flood evacuation order was issued for parts of North Richmond in Sydney’s west, with anyone downstream of Redbank Dam ordered to leave the area. NSW State Emergency Services sent a text notification warning “major flooding similar to March 2021” was expected along the Hawkesbury and Nepean Rivers, urging communities to prepare and evacuate when asked. Buchanan – a lawyer and engineer specialising in construction – says the management of the current floods has been last-minute at best, and absent at worst. “All of the low-lying areas here are places where the government has encouraged development to occur, thousands of households,” he says. “If you get a rain event like this – you get a week out and know the rain is going to fall. You know the catchment is saturated. You can pretty much predict what’s going to happen to the dam.” Buchanan says Warragamba Dam has been at 98% capacity for weeks and he believes it could have been better managed. “They know we’re in a La Niña event,” he says. “They know the water’s coming up and now they’ve hit the level of the spillway and they’re having to open the gates. “We’re dealing with a situation where there is a massive amount of water coming down the river all of a sudden – instantly. It’s an avoidable scenario.” The Warragamba Dam began spilling at about 3am on Wednesday, coming with a warning for “significant river level rises” along the Nepean, Hawkesbury and Lower Nepean rivers. The Bureau of Meteorology warned “major flooding” was possible from Wednesday evening at Penrith, North Richmond, Windsor and downstream. Buchanan says he made repeated inquiries to WaterNSW as to whether they would spill the dam before the rains hit and hadn’t heard back. In the past 24 hours, the BoM changed its “minor” flood warning for the Richmond region to “major”, with river levels above 1954, 1974 and 2017 peaks at Coraki and downstream. “The last time this happened, I spent two days in a tinnie saving horses and cattle,” Buchanan says. “This is all happening again. You can say ‘it’s the weather, that’s what you get’, absolutely. But the government has done nothing since last year.” Buchanan and Magnusson plan to wait out the evening on their horse breeding property eating noodles. They’ll be looking at the floorboards they are yet to repair from the last flooding event in 2021. To date, neither has received commonwealth disaster assistance, despite applying for multiple grants. Geraldine lives down the road from Buchanan and says her biggest fear is the unknown. But she’s sure “a lot could be done better that hasn’t been since last time”. Geraldine says there have been “so many disappointments” from governments who, she says, haven’t adequately cleaned up the mess from 2021 or delivered promised flood mitigation strategies. “The last floods there was a lot of damage, including the riverbank being washed out and a big hole they only started to attempt to fix recently,” she says. “It’s complete incompetence [and] it’s going to be a bigger flood than last year.” She says despite promises, there’s been no improvement for flood preparedness from the events that unfolded in March 2021. “We haven’t even got sandbags,” she says. “I had to ring the SES and nobody could give us a number. Apparently they’re making them now, but it’s too late when we’re busy packing our homes.” Geraldine has moved everything to the second story of her house and says “that’s all we can do”. “We know what it’s like living on a flood plain but … the flood relief packages the government proudly announced? … It took me three weeks and every single day, hours on the phone, to get $1,000. “It reduced me to tears from pure frustration … it’s impossible.” Fiona Fagan has lived in Richmond for seven years. She was doing last minute shopping at the packed Richmond Coles on Wednesday afternoon, where shoppers were rushing to purchase essential supplies for the hours ahead, with lines of trolleys packed with toilet paper, flour and nappies. Fagan is used to flooding and wild weather, but she says there’s an anxiety and a frustration in the air this year that’s unique. “There’s been so much hype because of what’s been happening in Lismore and Brisbane, everyone’s been talking about this ‘weather bomb’,” she says. “I know the dam’s full … it’s just a case of wait and see.” Fagan’s house has never flooded – it’s about 25 metres above sea level and more than 100 years old – but she says everything at the moment is “unprecedented”. “We’re a little bit jumpy,” she says. “But we should be OK.”",News/Australia news,"A year on from devastating floods, Richmond residents are again facing disaster",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/02/a-year-on-from-devastating-floods-richmond-residents-are-again-facing-disaster
3/2/2022,"What is it like to navigate not only a stage but the entire theatre industry as a blind person? From the practicalities of performing to harmful preconceptions about the roles visually impaired actors can play – and how blindness itself is portrayed – there is a lot to deal with. Actors Chloë Clarke and Douglas Walker recognise scenarios such as audition scripts printed in a font size that is too small – but they also tell me about the good practice they have experienced. Speaking over Zoom from her home in Cardiff, her guide dog resting by her feet, Clarke explains how technology helps. The 38-year-old performer, who is also an audio description consultant, uses bone-conduction headphones in rehearsals to be line-fed by a colleague, rather than struggling to sight read. She also tells me enthusiastically how her iPad is useful, “in terms of enlarging text and using the camera to zoom in on action happening in the room that I can’t otherwise see”. Walker, a 36-year-old, Bristol-based actor, comedian and writer, says that seeing a model of the set up close during rehearsals familiarises him with the stage layout. When he is performing, bits of glow-in-the-dark tape (which the audience can’t see) are placed on the back of pieces of the set so that he can orientate himself. There aren’t just practical implications for blind actors but questions about the roles they go for as well. How do they approach playing a fully sighted character? Maybe we should stop assuming that a character is non-disabled just because the script doesn’t specify whether they have a disability, suggests Walker. “I usually do imagine that I’m playing a fully sighted character,” he says, “but I have also had points where I have realised that it doesn’t matter, I can leave that ambiguous.” Both have auditioned for roles as visually impaired characters. “I often audition for blind roles where they expect you to turn up looking completely blind, and the issue there is that people’s preconceptions about what a blind person looks like, of course, don’t marry with reality,” says Clarke. In these situations, she has a conversation with the creative team about how they portray blindness on stage. Clarke explains how, early in her career, she didn’t want to be described as a visually impaired actor. But her perspective has shifted. “I’m proud to call myself a disabled person, and I’m a proud disability rights activist,” she says resolutely. She cites learning about the social model of disability in her 20s as vital to this. The social model emphasises that it is barriers in society, from unmarked steps to discriminatory attitudes, that disable people, rather than their impairment. For Clarke, the social model doesn’t just influence her disabled identity, but also her thoughts on the controversial topic of non-disabled actors “cripping up” to play disabled characters. These actors, Clarke argues, can’t understand the societal barriers disabled people face every day. “Until you have that lived experience of being ostracised, and othered, and feared and pitied all at once, you can’t possibly represent that authentically and fairly,” she says. Walker takes a different approach. “Acting is always about representing someone that you are not,” he says. It’s important, Walker tells me, that it’s done sensitively, with a non-disabled actor seeking out the lived experience of people they are portraying. But both Walker and Clarke highlight that in such cases, roles are being taken away from disabled actors. Getting involved with visually impaired theatre organisation Extant was integral to Walker’s career. In 2018, he joined their artist development initiative, Pathways, which included workshops on different types of dramatic work, including Shakespeare, physical theatre and film. Other sessions focused on how to pitch yourself to casting directors and preparing for auditions. Through Pathways, he met the head casting director for the National Theatre, who invited him to – successfully – audition for a part in The Visit in 2020. “It’s undeniable that it made a difference,” says Walker of Pathways. “It wasn’t just how do you go about being an actor, but how do you go about being a visually impaired actor.” Walker learned how to advocate for himself in the industry. In her work on Equity’s Deaf and Disabled Members’ Committee, Clarke helps support actors who have faced discrimination. Her company, Elbow Room, aims to make space in the industry for disabled performers. With Elbow Room, Clarke produced the comedy The Importance of Being Described … Earnestly?, which playfully interrogates the idea of audio description in theatre and raises questions about the challenge of getting the industry to take accessibility seriously. It’s important, Clarke says, for theatre to move away from tropes about disabled lives – that they are always tragic or about “overcoming” – and instead recognise the diversity of experiences. “Until disabled writers, directors and casting directors become more prevalent, and disabled people can tell their own stories, we are always going to be stereotypes,” says Clarke. “The industry has got such a huge responsibility in how society perceives disabled people. I really want to see the industry starting to live up to that responsibility.”",Arts/Stage,"Blindness on stage: ‘Until disabled people can tell their own stories, we’ll always be stereotypes’",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/02/blindness-on-stage-until-disabled-people-can-tell-their-own-stories-well-always-be-stereotypes
3/2/2022,"Meta has rejected a demand from United Australia party leader Craig Kelly to suspend its community standards enforcement and factchecking on politicians’ posts on Facebook during the upcoming federal election campaign. Kelly, who had his Facebook and Instagram accounts banned last year for allegedly breaching the company’s misinformation policy over posts promoting unproven Covid-19 treatments ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, described the practice as “foreign interference”. Kelly has previously denied his social media posts contained “misinformation”, claiming they were backed up and their removal amounted to censorship. At a hearing of the parliamentary committee examining social media and online safety, Kelly asked officials from Meta to guarantee “there will be no foreign interference by Meta in the Australian election” by blocking, shadow-banning, or deplatforming political candidates or parties. Facebook’s head of public policy in Australia, Josh Machin, said the company would continue to apply its community standards policy. Kelly asked whether that meant posts would be factchecked and their reach reduced or posts removed, and Machin said the current rules would continue to apply. “If a piece of content violates our community standards then yes, we’ll be removing it,” he said. “And that’s a really important protection that we have in place in order to protect the safety and the integrity of the election campaign. Kelly argued the policy was potentially a breach of the implied freedom of political speech. Machin said the policy is applied evenly for politicians and the rest of the public. Although Kelly is banned from the platform, his party is not, and according to Facebook’s transparency report, the United Australia party has spent over $513,000 on ads in the last 90 days alone on Facebook – the largest political ad spend in Australia on the platform. Party founder Clive Palmer has separately spent over $161,000 in the same period. The Liberal party spent over $44,000 in the same period. Separately, Meta has come under pressure from the Labor party in particular to crack down on misinformation on its platform ahead of the federal election expected in May. The party has concerns of a repeat of the 2019 election where Facebook refused to remove content, unrelated to Kelly and the UAP, during the campaign that falsely claimed Labor would institute a death tax if it won the election. Machin said Facebook did factcheck and demote the original posts and similar ones making the claim at the time, but would not remove politicians debating about what a potential government might do, or people expressing their opinions about it. “We’ve discussed at the committee previously the importance of ensuring that we’re able to have proper democratic debate and that platforms such as ourselves, [are] only taking steps in relation to limiting what political parties say when there is a real-world harm element,” he said. “And so that category of material wasn’t subject to factchecking.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labor’s shadow assistant minister for communications, Tim Watts, asked the company to put a timeline on how long fact checks would take in the context of a four-week election campaign, however the company would not state how long such checks would take. Meta also rejected Reset Australia research claiming five ads designed by the researchers and containing obvious election misinformation were approved by Facebook. The ads included claims the poll had been cancelled due to Covid, and people who weren’t vaccinated could not vote. They were deleted by the researchers before they could go live. Machin said none of the ads went live on Facebook, and would have been picked up by other methods as they all violated the company’s policies on political advertising and misinformation. “I think it’s important just to confirm that these ads did not go live, but was only the initial point of our enforcement approach which would have applied and so it’s not correct to look at the exercise undertaken by this lobby group as an indication of whether our systems are able to adequately detect or enforce potential misinformation,” he said.",News/Technology,Meta rejects Craig Kelly’s demand to suspend factchecking on Facebook during election campaign,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/02/meta-rejects-craig-kellys-demand-to-suspend-factchecking-on-facebook-during-election-campaign
3/2/2022,"Winter is here and Young Country Diary is once again open for submissions. Every three months we ask you to send us a piece about the natural world, written by a child aged 8-14. The article can be about anything to do with nature – whether it’s cliff-top birdwatching, a worm in the garden or a wintry walk in the park. It doesn’t matter if the child is a nature expert or has never picked up a pair of binoculars. We are especially keen to reach teachers who might like to get their class outside and noticing nature. We will pick six winning entries to be published in the Guardian newspaper and online – two in January, two in February and two in March. Then we will do another callout for pieces in spring. First of all, we’re looking for children age 8 to 14, so we will need your permission, as parent or guardian. Then here’s what the child needs to do: Step 1 – Go out one day to where there is some nature. It could be their local woods or beach, their nearest park, a farm, or it could simply be a garden. Step 2 – Write an article telling us where they were and what happened. The article needs to be between 200 and 250 words. Photos are helpful (especially landscape rather than portrait) but they are not a condition of entry. (NB, photos cannot be attached to the form below, but please do state if you have one.) Step 3 – We ask that you fill in the form rather than the child, pasting their piece below and filling in all other details. If they get stuck and don’t know what to write about, here are a few hints and tips to pass on to them:  Good nature writing starts with the senses – so what did you see and hear? What about smell and touch? Take notes when you’re out and about so you don’t forget  How would you describe what happened? Did it remind you of anything?  It’s great to look up some extra information about what you saw, and tell us about that too. For example, if you saw some blue tits feeding – what do they eat? Do they eat a lot? What are blue tits normally doing at this time of year?  You can think big, and describe the whole scene – the sky, the horizon, the landscape. Or you can think small, and tell us some details about the butterfly’s wings or the beetle’s markings.  What did your encounter with nature make you think about? How did it make you feel? Submissions are open for four weeks – the deadline for entry is Thursday 13 January. Anyone can enter their child who is aged between 8 and 14 and based in the UK. You the parent/guardian will be contacted if your child’s piece is selected for publication, and you will be paid on behalf of the child. The selected pieces will be published in January, February and March, and you will be informed of the precise dates.

3/2/2022,"Governments talk of green jobs, green industrial revolutions and creating green new deals. The aim of these efforts is to tackle runaway climate change, biodiversity loss and inequality by remoulding our political and economic systems. But where is the blue in all of this? As Chris Armstrong writes, there can be no green transformation without a blue one alongside it. For most of us, ocean ecosystems are out of sight, out of mind. We refer to tropical rainforests as the “lungs of the Earth” but tiny organisms called phytoplankton release 70% of the planet’s oxygen – much more than trees. In total, the oceans store 50 times more carbon than our atmosphere. The Gulf Stream alone transports 550tn calories of heat across the North Atlantic every second. Without this, the tropics would be unbearably hot and more temperate regions extremely cold. It helps make Earth the Goldilocks planet, perfect for life to thrive. Unfortunately, the way our ocean economies work at the moment is driving widespread environmental destruction. The familiar problem of floating plastic pollution is just a tiny part of the story. Under the surface, the ocean is being emptied of wild marine life and filled with a few species of farmed fish. Marine dead zones are growing as ocean acidification and warming gets worse. People don’t know the extent of it because we can’t see it. Armstrong takes us through humanity’s changing relationship with the ocean, starting with how it enriched sailors, whalers and early explorers. “Exploitation and abuse at sea are probably as old as sailing itself,” he writes. During the 17th century, people believed that the sea was inexhaustible, but this changed as whalers had to move to more dangerous hunting waters in polar regions as catches became more scarce. By the mid 20th century, many whale species were on the verge of extinction. For every 100 blue whales that swam in our oceans before the advent of commercial whaling, just one exists now. “An ocean that once resounded with their calls has become a place of ghostly silence,” Armstrong writes. The exciting thing about ocean restoration is that marine ecosystems recover much faster than terrestrial ones, so marine life could rebound significantly in a single human generation. Whale populations are starting to increase following catastrophic declines from commercial whaling, and this small success needs to be repeated across the board. To do this, Armstrong suggests putting 80% of the ocean under protection as marine reserves, which would lead to surprisingly rapid regeneration. Other priorities for a successful blue new deal include promoting seaweed farming, shellfish aquaculture, greening ports and planting mangroves. We must also outlaw harmful fishing subsidies and destructive fishing practices such as using cyanide and dynamite, and create better legal protections for whales and dolphins. The book provides a persuasive guide to recovery, and is an inspiring and invigorating read. There needs to be more blue amid all this talk of green recoveries, because if the oceans fail – and with the slowing of the Gulf Stream there are early indications tipping points might not be far off – then the whole planet will.

3/2/2022,"Only a few days have passed since Vladimir Putin’s troops invaded Ukraine, but it is already clear the consequences will be profound and generational. The striking design on the Guardian Weekly’s cover this week is by Sergiy Maidukov, a Kyiv-based illustrator. His depiction of plumes of smoke rising from a Ukrainian horizon was one of several images he created on his iPad while under curfew in the city. “We are sharing an apartment with four friends and doing some volunteering – delivering food and stuff,” Maidukov wrote on Monday. “I live now at the swing of extreme feelings, from dark fear to bright optimism. In days like these, it is impossible to be on one’s own.” He and his friends have also been donating blood. But, amid the bleak scenes, he also feels hope for the future: “I feel that this time, historically, we have the best chances ever to fight Russia back. We are already discussing how we should rebuild our country after the victory. Glory to Ukraine!” Our special edition of the magazine this week contains 16 pages of dedicated news coverage, kicking off with Russian author Vladimir Sorokin’s scathing essay on the rot at the heart of Moscow’s power pyramid that has created a monster. Shaun Walker, Emma Graham-Harrison and Peter Beaumont lead our coverage on the ground in Ukraine, while there’s brilliant analysis and context from the rest of the Guardian and Observer’s international reporting team, including Timothy Garton Ash and Daniel Boffey. Then, on the Opinion pages, with hundreds of thousands now fleeing Ukraine and the west facing up to a new existential threat, Jonathan Freedland offers the stark reminder that while Putin’s appalling worldview took full shape, it was our leaders who wilfully looked the other way. The nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the US supreme court last week may understandably have passed below many people’s radar. Lauren Gambino explains why Jackson’s rise is a timely boost for Joe Biden, while in Opinion Moira Donegan argues that the president’s groundbreaking choice was born to the role.

3/2/2022,"It is only a screengrab, a capture of a fleeting expression that did not reflect the overall tone of his address to the media on Tuesday. But it might prove to be the image Rob Manfred is remembered for, on the day that may well define his tenure as Major League Baseball commissioner. the man who called the world series trophy “a piece of metal” smiling on a day when mlb cancels games pic.twitter.com/UpVgC74yyH A smile. A toothy grin as he announced that the league and the players’ union have not reached a deal on a new collective bargaining agreement and so the first two series of the regular season, which was due to start on 31 March, are cancelled. Spring training delayed, Opening Day postponed: this is jarring for a sport that derives much of its appeal from the comfort of rhythms and rituals, its metronomic on-field tempo and its daily presence in the calendar and America’s popular consciousness from spring to fall every year, since always. Manfred had warned less than three weeks ago that this would be a “disastrous outcome”. It is doubtful that the team owners agree, since they locked out the players last December yet waited for 43 days before starting meaningful dialogue. The players are resolute and the owners are not in a rush – the latter are very rich individuals who can afford to take the hit. It is not a recipe for smooth and swift discussions. FANS…this man doesn’t care about any of y’all. Don’t get it twisted. The players are ready to perform, compete, and interact with all of you! However, Manfred has been ruining our game while playing puppet boy to the owners. That’s a fact. We remain ready and anxious to play! 🗣 https://t.co/M9x6LBdBlv Players resorted to gallows humour on social media on Monday. Joey Gallo of the New York Yankees joined LinkedIn. The Philadelphia Phillies’ Bryce Harper offered his services to the Yomiuri Giants in Japan. By Tuesday the mood had turned to anger. “Manfred has been ruining our game while playing puppet boy to the owners,” Chicago Cubs pitcher Marcus Stroman vented on Twitter. “Manfred gotta go.” The players’ union issued a statement claiming the lockout is “the culmination of a decades-long attempt by owners to break our player fraternity” adding that “players and fans around the world who love baseball are disgusted, but sadly not surprised.” You might say that a sport with a 162-game regular season can afford to skip a few fixtures. But if the clubs’ billionaire owners apparently care little about missing a week or more of games, why should the general public react with anything but apathy whenever baseball does return after the first work stoppage since the strike that cancelled the 1994 World Series? “I think it’s a big deal because of the fans more than anything,” says Eduardo Perez, a former player for six MLB teams who is now an ESPN analyst. He was a young infielder with the California (now Los Angeles) Angels during the 94-95 strike. “It definitely did leave a dent on a lot of fans,” he recalls. While uncertainty grips the sport, the players are sure about one thing: they deserve better. “The average baseball player plays less than five years in the big leagues. It’s true that 63% of the players in 2019 had less than three years service time,” Perez says. “The players have a point when you look at the data and they didn’t come out too good in the last collective bargaining agreement [in 2016], there’s no hiding that fact.” There is no formal salary cap in MLB, but nor is there a minimum spend per team, unlike the NFL, NHL and NBA. “Major League Baseball is a significantly worse deal probably at this point for the players than any of the other big leagues in the US,” says Victor Matheson, an economics professor at College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts. Average ages have dropped as teams prefer younger – cheaper – players to costlier veterans. Hot prospects are sometimes held in the minor leagues to save money and delay their eventual free-agency eligibility, when they can either demand a huge pay rise or leave for another team. The union wants its members to be eligible for salary arbitration more quickly, which would lead to higher wages for young players. It is calling for a raise in the minimum wage, which was $570,500 in 2021. It is agitating for a raise in the luxury tax threshold to reduce the financial penalties levied on the biggest spenders. And it is asking for a draft lottery to discourage teams from tanking to secure high draft picks. That strategy was infamously embraced by the Houston Astros. Four years before they won the 2017 World Series they lost 111 games with a squad paid about $25m. That was $4m less than the wage of Alex Rodriguez, then of the Yankees. In a country where the federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, the optics are tricky when a representative such as the pitcher Max Scherzer, who agreed a three-year, $130m contract with the New York Mets last November, is one of the faces of a union complaining that an annual salary of $570,500 is stingy. But the issue is how revenue is distributed, not whether income levels are grotesquely inflated in comparison to the wages earned by ordinary mortals doing ordinary jobs. (Or minor-leaguers, for that matter.) Elite baseball players may inhabit a different economic planet to the rest of us, and there’s something apt about these negotiations taking place in a Florida town named Jupiter. All the same, they’re entitled to fair and proportionate treatment – and many of them do not enjoy long careers, so need to maximise their earnings while they can. In a non-pandemic year, the NHL is estimated to garner total league revenue of $5bn. That’s about half MLB’s gross. Yet the NHL’s minimum wage is $750,000, albeit with smaller rosters. Manfred said on Tuesday that the league offered $700,000 and an annual bonus pool for young players worth $30m. “It’s weird to be rooting for the underdog when the underdog is a guy who might be making $30m a year, but that $30m a year player is still at a huge disadvantage to that billionaire owner,” Matheson says. “The owners are always going to have way more power than the unions because the owners can be around for 50 years; a player has a pretty limited career so it’s pretty hard for a player to say, ‘I’m going to sit around for one year here to try and get more money in the future’.” Though a handful of stars collect staggering amounts, overall, salaries are stagnating, and even sinking. Baseball’s payrolls for 40-man rosters in 2021 were down 4.6% from 2017’s record high of nearly $4.25bn, according to information obtained by the Associated Press. On Opening Day last year the mean salary was about $4.17m, down by 6.4% from 2017, while the median was $1.15m - a tumble of 30% from its record high in 2015. Rising revenues and falling salaries are a recipe for workforce unrest in any sphere. At heart, this is a familiar tale of the middle class being hollowed out by very rich tycoons who want to be even richer. These days, baseball might only be “America’s pastime” to nostalgics, but its income inequality is a perfect emblem of American capitalism today. Any concessions to the players when a deal is eventually struck will likely be offset by new revenue streams that promise to be quick windfalls for owners but detrimental to the product, such as expanded playoffs that further undermine the relevance of the regular season, and advertising on uniforms, a shattering of one of the last taboos. Gambling promises to be a fruitful source of income in the coming years. And with traditional broadcasters scrambling to retain customers in a fracturing and volatile media landscape, sports are still at a point where media rights deals increase, boosting franchise values, even as ratings decline. Nearly a quarter of the US population watched Game Six of the 1980 World Series. Last year’s Game Six was viewed by 4.3% of the country. “For a lot of people, baseball is the perfect sport for radio, it’s the perfect sport for a bygone era, it’s everyone’s grandfather’s favourite sport, but it’s not the favourite sport of people who are 18,” Matheson says. The fanbase is old, with an average age of 57 in 2016 according to a Sports Business Journal study, versus 50 for the NFL, 42 for the NBA and 40 for MLS. And there are flaws in the on-field product. Despite efforts to speed up play, nine-inning games last year lasted a record three hours and 10 minutes on average. Game One of the World Series, a 6-2 win for the Atlanta Braves, finished in nine innings yet dragged on for four hours and six minutes, ending after midnight on the east coast. Fans might be less fidgety if there was an abundance of on-field action and mesmerising battles between famous starting pitchers and sluggers – as was the case in the captivating (albeit dubiously performance-enhanced) years after the 1994-95 strike. But the league-wide batting average in 2021 dipped to .244, the lowest since 1968, as teams become ever better at deploying sophisticated data, such as individually-tailored defensive fielding shifts. The spectacle of ace starting pitchers duelling deep into games is becoming an anachronism. Managers chop and change, stalling momentum and subjugating human-interest narratives to the colourless imperatives of statistical probability. A sport long stained by cheating scandals – whether steroids, sign-stealing or sticky substances – can ill afford to have its waning charm further tempered by tactics that sterilise the drama. Last May, the Miami Marlins manager, Don Mattingly, described baseball as “unwatchable” at times. Tuesday’s news means that for now, that’s the literal truth. And every day disputing dollars is a day not spent addressing baseball’s structural problems. Together, the lockout and the entertainment level do not represent an existential threat but a danger that the sport could further lose its totemic status in American life, enduring a cultural relegation as it fades into a form of background noise: still important for many, but inessential for most. It’s nothing to smile about.",Sport/Sport,MLB becomes literally unwatchable as baseball self-sabotages again,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/02/mlb-opening-day-lost-lockout-baseball-talks-players-owners
3/2/2022,"Just for fun, suppose you are a pro football fan from, say, Philadelphia. That would mean you probably like/love/fixate on the Eagles. It would probably mean that you’d root for any other pro football team attaching “Philadelphia” to its nickname, as long as it did not play in the fall. Philadelphia and seven other cities, states or regions are getting new pro football teams next month, when the second version of the United States Football League makes its debut. The Philadelphia team will be called the Stars, after the team in the first iteration of the USFL. Although the Philadelphia Stars last played a USFL game in 1984 before spending their final season in Baltimore, the team’s name seems logical, perhaps until you find out that they won’t be playing any games in Philadelphia for at least this season and maybe in 2023. All USFL teams, bar one, won’t play any “home” games this year, because the 10-game regular season will be played at two stadiums in Birmingham, Alabama (home of the Stallions), with the USFL playoffs scheduled to be played in Canton, Ohio. Birmingham was booked. So it goes for the newest NFL rival. Perhaps the new USFL – which league officials stress is not associated with the old USFL or its owners – will draw plenty of fans tuning into Fox, FS1, NBC, USA and Peacock thirsting for out-of-NFL-season pro football action. The first version of the USFL, which also had a spring schedule, lasted three seasons in the 1980s, and it was somewhat successful before a notorious USFL team owner aiming to use the team to elbow his way into the NFL ran the league into the ground. That owner was Donald J Trump, a relatively obscure New York real-estate developer at the time who, you may have heard, went on to find other work. That USFL included several future NFL stars – Steve Young, Jim Kelly, Reggie White, Herschel Walker – but Trump became the name most synonymous with that USFL, and not in a good way. This USFL is a new entity controlled by Fox Sports, the sports programming division of the Fox Corporation, which owns the news channel closely associated with the ex-president. The first game in the eight-team league, pitting New Jersey and Birmingham, will be televised by Fox and NBC. Yes, the New Jersey Generals and Birmingham Stallions. There were two teams with those names in the old USFL; Trump owned the Generals. The other six teams are named after old USFL teams, with the same logos and colors, and similar helmets and uniforms. By filing a lawsuit Monday, some owners and executives from the old USFL made it clear they don’t like the idea of reusing those names. Fox is “claiming the legacy of something it didn’t build,” says Nicholas Matich of the McKool Smith law firm, which represents the group called Real USFL LLC. Larry Csonka, the Hall of Fame Miami Dolphins fullback who was the general manager of the USFL’s Jacksonville Bulls and is the initial manager of the group, said in a news release: “It boils down to this: If the USFL doesn’t have any value, why did Fox want it?” It is, to say the least, an unusual branding approach, since the last USFL game was played 37 years ago. The league was killed off after Trump, seeking to move the USFL to the fall, won an antitrust suit against the NFL but was awarded all of $3 in damages. Meet the old gang: Houston Gamblers, Michigan Panthers, New Orleans Breakers, Pittsburgh Maulers and Tampa Bay Bandits, plus the Stars, Generals and Stallions. (The Bulls, Los Angeles Express and Memphis Showboats were among those who did not make the cut.) To resurrect team and league names is not unheard of in pro sports. The American Football League that fully merged with the NFL in 1970 was actually the fourth AFL, following versions in 1926, 1936-37 and 1940-41. There was also an All-American Football Conference. The New York Yankees were in the first three versions of the AFL, and teams known as the Cincinnati Bengals were members of the last three AFLs. (A team from AFL II, the Cleveland Rams, jumped to the NFL in 1937 and still exist as the Los Angeles Rams.) But this is the first time an entire league is using nicknames and colors from an old league by the same name. The league won’t say why. Jeff Pearlman, who wrote the entertaining 2018 book about the old USFL, Football for a Buck: The Crazy Rise and Crazier Demise of the USFL, was asked by the Guardian recently what he thought about this arrangement. “I truly have no idea,” Pearlman replied. “I’ve been trying to get my head around it, but I can’t. Also, they’re not even making it about the old league. At all. So they have the helmets, unis and team names, but no nostalgia. I’m befuddled.” Most of the old trademarks were picked up by the co-founder of the new USFL, Brian Woods, from something called the A-11 Football League, which folded in 2014 before it played a game. Woods had run a showcase league called The Spring League from 2017 to 2021. Woods seems to have no illusions that this USFL, some or all of it, will merge with the NFL. That was the downfall of the first USFL. Trump bought the Generals after their first season and spent the next two years trying to convince the other owners to move the league to the fall, at which point, Trump believed, the NFL would take in some USFL teams, namely, his. Myles Tanenbaum, the Stars’ owner, did not want to move the USFL to the fall. The Stars, coached by Jim Mora, were built to win, playing in all three USFL title games, winning in 1984 while playing in Philadelphia, then in 1985 when it practiced at several places, including Pimlico Race Track, and played its home games in College Park, Maryland, 30 miles from Baltimore. And, at least for now, the Stars are back, although they are not the same people, and they are not literally back in town. The Philadelphia Inquirer ran a short story last week on the Stars’ likely new quarterback, just in case people might be interested. ",Sport/Sport,Donald Trump helped kill the first USFL.

3/2/2022,"Russia’s bombardment of the city of Kharkiv marked the start of a new phase in its campaign against Ukraine – and one that appeared timed to reinforce Moscow’s demands at the negotiations between Ukraine and Russia taking place at the same moment in Belarus. The failure to achieve the swift victory in Ukraine that Vladimir Putin seems to have been expecting will mean the country finds itself facing Russia’s capacity to win wars not through adroit use of modern equipment and motivated, professional troops, but through bludgeoning its opponents into submission at a distance. Russia’s way of war has remained consistent because it consistently brings success. And that involves targeting populated areas, to cause the maximum suffering among civilians and force its victims to submit in order to bring that suffering to an end. The attack on Kharkiv may just be the first instance of medieval levels of brutality and viciousness inflicted on Ukraine’s civilian population – just made all the more devastating by Russia’s 21st-century weapons of destruction. Russia is likely to repeat what it sees as a war-winning tactic of besieging cities and exploiting the destruction of their infrastructure to leave their inhabitants facing intolerable conditions. The question may soon be how long the millions of Ukrainians who have remained in major cities can survive in underground shelters while Russia does its best to deny them access to food, water and medical supplies. The only restraining factor on Russia’s campaign of destruction is likely to be the knowledge that cities that have been reduced to rubble are harder to fight into and capture than ones that can be seized intact. To think Russia would not resort to terror campaigns to achieve its war aims is to ignore the example of Chechnya and also of Russia’s intervention in Syria. There, many at first thought that Russian bomb and missile strikes on civilian infrastructure including hospitals, schools and water treatment plants were the result of incompetence or error. They only gradually realised that this was in fact deliberate policy – bringing the conflict to an end as rapidly as possible by ensuring that civilian support for resistance was crushed. In Ukraine, Russia does not appear yet to have employed chemical weapons. But again, following the experience of Syria, Moscow is in no doubt as to their devastating effect as a terror weapon, and nobody should be surprised if and when they do make an appearance. There’s little to constrain Russia, which has always been impervious to western horror and condemnation. There’s little likelihood that Russia will be deterred by the prospect of outrage at home either, even if knowledge of what its military is doing abroad filters through to domestic audiences. Moscow has taken steps in advance to ensure the truth does not reach its population. The ban on the Russian media using the words “war” or “invasion” to describe the conflict with Ukraine builds on decades of preparation to secure Russia’s “national information space” against inconvenient facts. And even as sanctions start to bite ordinary people hard and the Russian government scrambles to contain the damage to its economy, the scope for public discontent or protest to change anything has also been pre-empted. Russia has not only already shown its willingness to crush protest by its own people brutally, but has substantial capabilities in reserve for inflicting mass casualties on them should the situation require it. On the frontlines too, we may have seen video of disoriented and demotivated Russian soldiers taken captive, but the continuing bombardments of Ukraine’s cities shows that there are many more who are willing to obey orders to commit war crimes. One of the many tragedies of this war is that the only thing the west supplied to Ukraine in abundance before it started was missed opportunities. Now, Russia will want to win quickly, before the massively increased aid to Ukraine announced by its western partners has time to be absorbed into its armed forces and build resilience and capacity to withstand the Russian onslaught. The startling reversal in Europe’s approach to Moscow seen in recent days will provide much-needed support to Ukraine’s capacity to resist – as long as it’s not too little, too late. But alongside military supplies such as arms, ammunition and body armour, Ukraine will be desperately in need of medical aid and humanitarian support for vast numbers of displaced people. And this is not just an urgent challenge for Ukraine. The potential for Russian military success or failure is still, at this point, an open question. But one thing that is beyond doubt is that if current Russian tactics continue, it will create a humanitarian disaster on a scale Europe has not seen in decades. Together with rapidly rebuilding their conventional military defences, EU states and the UK must brace themselves for the social impact this will inevitably bring. The movements of population westwards will be comparable with those at the end of the second world war, as Russia reasserted its grip on the countries of eastern Europe. There’s little doubt that Russia will then be eager to exploit the flows of refugees to harm the west – building on its test runs in 2015-16 against Norway and Finland, when Russian organised crime was allowed to capitalise on the situation, and last year against Poland, when flows of migrants were manipulated and brutalised by Putin’s close allies in Belarus. But in Ukraine itself, Russia will soon want to present President Zelensky with a terrible choice: to continue to resist, and fight for freedom and independence at an appalling cost in deaths of civilians and destruction of Ukraine’s cities; or to accept Russia’s terms to preserve life even at the cost of submitting once again to Moscow’s rule. It is not the first time the people of Ukraine have faced this choice. It will be to the eternal shame of Europe if they are left to face it again today.

3/2/2022,"Svetlana Golub’s phone had not stopped ringing since Thursday. At the other end of the line, tearful family members across Russia frantically tried to figure out the fate of their sons, brothers and husbands fighting in Russia’s bloody war in Ukraine. “It is crazy,” said Golub, pointing to her glowing phone. “We are getting hundreds and hundreds of calls. It’s just a sea of tears.” Golub is the head of the Soldiers’ Mothers Committee, an NGO advocating for soldiers’ rights that has become the main contact point for the worried relatives of Russian soldiers. “See, I told you,” Golub shrugged, picking up another call during a conversation in her office in a residential area in north-east Moscow. “This just keeps going and going. Everyone is very busy, we constantly receive people, get requests. We represent the interests of families in court and bring their concerns to the authorities,” Golub said. Families of those fighting the war have received practically no information about the involvement of their loved ones in the conflict. As the fighting enters its fifth day, more relatives of the tens of thousands of soldiers deployed are turning to groups like the one run by Golub. “The families are being completely left in the dark. They had no idea that a military special operation was about to happen,” Golub said. In one of the calls received by the organization and heard by the Guardian, a tearful mother begged Golub to find her son who the mother said she hadn’t heard of since the beginning of February. “I know the situation is really bad when the families tell me they can’t reach the soldiers any more,” Golub said. In peacetime, the group usually stands up for the rights of soldiers. But now its efforts are completely focused on the war in Ukraine. Golub said her organisation uses its own database to locate soldiers,sending requests to officials as to their whereabouts and status. Throughout the morning, Golub received calls from relatives saying their loved ones were unwilling to fight in Ukraine. In one, a mother from the southern region of Dagestan said her son, who was on the frontline, had told his officers that he didn’t want to participate in the conflict. They told him he had no choice. “This really shouldn’t be going on,” Golub said. Despite predictions from western intelligence, Russian troops have so far failed to quickly take Kyiv, and questions are being raised about the troops’ morale and preparedness. Rob Lee, a Russian military expert and former US marine, said the situation on the ground indicated many soldiers seem insufficiently prepared for the war. “It’s becoming clear that Putin only told very senior officers about the invasion. Soldiers look to be completely unaware of what their mission is in Ukraine,” Lee said. According to Lee, this unpreparedness could have a “massive impact” on the morale of the soldiers, as Russia is set to intensify its fighting while facing strong and wide Ukrainian resistance. “You need to psychologically train your soldiers to fight an insurgency war. Emotionally, it is very hard to fight against a country whose people don’t want you to be there. The Russian military has already committed some very basic mistakes from strategic to tactical levels. “The morale problem is set to grow if we see fighting going into cities with all the deadly consequences that sort of warfare brings,” he added. Apart from assisting families who were trying to locate their relatives, Soldiers’ Mothers Committee is also hoping to bring back the bodies of the soldiers who have already been killed. Golub said they decided to take the matter into their own hands after realising the ministry of defence “were dragging their feet” over returning the bodies. Russia has so far released little information about the damage Ukraine has inflicted on its troops. On Sunday, Russia’s ministry of defence for the first time admitted that there were “dead and wounded soldiers among our comrade[s]”, but added that “the number of destroyed [Ukrainian] nationalists by far outweigh” the number of Russian casualties. Three Russian regions have announced that their soldiers have been killed in the conflict. But Golub and independent military experts like Lee believe the country could be underplaying the real death toll. “Wars always lead to deaths. From the many conversations I have been sent between soldiers and their families, I believe many Russians have already died,” Golub said. Other information too points to the possibility that Russia could be facing heavy losses. Ukrainian officials have been posting graphic photographs on Telegram, showing what were said to be the bodies of Russian troops killed in action. Ukraine claims more than 5,000 Russian soldiers have been killed in the first four days of fighting. The Guardian has heard a telephone conversation between a Russian soldier and his wife, in which the soldier described “many” deaths among his group. “Sunshine, I am safe fighting in Ukraine. Sunshine, please don’t cry … Many of our soldiers have died … Our group only has 12 soldiers left. I am so sorry I’ve got to go. Tell Mum I said hi. I’ve got to go,” the man says, as his wife can be heard weeping. Golub just hoped the fighting would end soon. “Conflicts always mean lots of suffering. Please, both sides have to stop,” she said, adding she wished she could “lock Putin and Zelenskiy in a room and not let them out until they found a solution”. “I wouldn’t even give them water or bread to speed up the process,” Golub said. Despite receiving hundreds of calls and messages since the start of the war, she still looked visibly shaken after yet another call with one especially distressed mother. “You never get used to this suffering – it’s impossible.”",News/World news,‘Just a sea of tears’: the group helping anxious mothers of Russian soldiers,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/02/russian-soldiers-mothers-committee-ukraine
3/2/2022,"London commuters faced another challenging journey into work as most tube lines stayed closed following strike action. The majority of London Underground lines remained suspended on Wednesday morning after a 24-hour strike action by tube workers on Tuesday, with a further 24-hour walkout planned for Thursday. Shortly before 8am, only the Victoria and Central lines were running a good service. Eight others lines were suspended, part-suspended or showing delays, and the Northern Line was part-closed. The Docklands Light Railway was running a good service but the London Overground was operating a reduced service. The RMT union called the strikes in a dispute over pensions, jobs and working conditions following a breakdown in talks last week. An estimated 10,000 tube workers took part in the strike on Tuesday. The walkout forced the entire suspension of the network during the Tuesday morning rush-hour, although limited services returned later on a few lines. People tried to get to work on buses or in taxis but huge queues formed, forcing many to give up and go home. The Transport for London (TfL) chief operating officer, Andy Lord, was uncertain of the level of service that would be running on Wednesday. Speaking to BBC London, he said: “I’m hopeful that we’ll be able to provide slightly better service but unfortunately, I would still advise customers to check in advance and allow more time for their journey. He added: “There will be disruption on Thursday, and [Wednesday] morning until eight o’clock, or thereabouts, and again on Friday. I would please ask everybody to go to the TfL website, look at the TfL Go app, and check before they travel.” Meanwhile, unions have reacted with anger after a comment piece in the Daily Telegraph portrayed the RMT’s assistant general secretary, Eddie Dempsey, as a “apologist” for the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin because he met pro-Russian separatists in 2015. The Communication Workers Union described the article as a “disgrace”. In a tweet, it added: “RMT members are protecting their pensions and jobs. Instead of pathetic attacks like this let’s see a bit more about the Russian-funded Tory government that is trying to do these workers over.” The RMT’s former leader, Mick Cash, tweeted: “Shameful journalism. It would seem some are quite happy to follow in the dishonourable footsteps of those involved in the Zinoviev letter.

3/2/2022,"The New South Wales transport minister, David Elliott, personally intervened to reverse a departmental proposal to name a new underground metro station in the heart of Sydney after the traditional Aboriginal custodians of the land, despite it being signed off by a previous minister. Elliott has reportedly instead proposed the station be named after Australia’s first Aboriginal commissioned army officer. In August last year the Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council in Sydney floated a proposal with the NSW transport department to name a new metro station after the traditional owners of the land, the Gadigal people. The transport department accepted the idea, and received ministerial sign-off before sending a proposal to the Geographical Names Board of NSW (GNB) “to name a railway station located underground running parallel to Pitt Street, as Gadigal Railway Station”. The GNB is a statutory authority responsible for assigning names to places in NSW. In October, it called for submissions on the proposal and said the name “acknowledges the local Aboriginal custodians of the area”. “The proposed name Gadigal Railway Station is supported by the Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council and a number of other local key Aboriginal stakeholders,” the GNB chair, Narelle Underwood, said at the time. Suggestions for “alternative names” were “not being sought at this time”, she said. During the GNB’s one-month consultation period it received 120 submissions on the proposal, the majority of which supported naming the new station “Gadigal Railway Station”. However, under the GNB’s policies, if it receives any objections they are forwarded to the relevant government agency, in this case transport, for comment. In November the GNB provided the 120 submissions back to the transport department for its “consideration and comment” before making a decision. But despite transport submitting the proposal to name the station after the Gadigal people only a few months earlier, the GNB says it never heard back from the department on the consultation. Instead, two months after Elliott was sworn in as the new transport minister the GNB received a new proposal. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A spokesperson for the GNB told Guardian Australia it received a separate proposal from transport on 21 February putting forward a new name and requesting it “defer” the Gadigal Railway Station suggestion. “This request, along with the alternative name proposed by TfNSW will be considered by the GNB at its meeting on 8 March 2022,” the GNB spokesperson said. “If TfNSW chooses to proceed with the proposed name Gadigal Railway Station all submissions will be reviewed ahead of the name either being rejected, altered or endorsed by the NSW government.” Neither the transport department nor the minister’s office responded directly to questions about the decision. In a statement, a spokesperson for the new Sydney Metro did not say what the alternative name for the station was, or what had changed between August and February. “Sydney Metro consults with a number of stakeholders including local communities and cultural groups,” the spokesperson said. “The GNB is a statutory authority and is the sole authority for determining station names.” Elliott’s office did not respond to specific questions from Guardian Australia about his role in the decision, but hours later a story on the change appeared in Sydney’s tabloid newspaper the Daily Telegraph.

Captain Reginald Saunders, who served in Korea and the second world war, was a “hero”, Elliott told the Telegraph. He did not respond to the Guardian’s questions about why he considered the new proposal preferable to the Gadigal name. However, sources within the transport department told Guardian Australia that Elliott was directly involved in the decision to propose an alternate name for the station. On 18 February, three days before transport proposed a different name for the new station, Elliott met with officials from the department and Sydney Metro. During the meeting the Guardian understands the minister expressed his dislike of the original proposal, and instructed officials to change the name of the new station. Nathan Moran, the chief executive of the Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council, had not been told about the department’s backflip on the station’s name. He said staff from the department had been “supportive” of the idea when it was floated last year. “In talking to the project staff at transport about the concept of the new station we as the body responsible for the cultural heritage of the place where it will be constructed put forward the name of Gadigal to acknowledge the original custodians of the land where it will be built,” he said. “That’s where it started and we were pleased to see that transport progressed that suggestion. But of course there are differences between the administrative arm and the elected arm of the government. But it’s very sad to hear.” Due to open in 2024, the second stage of the Sydney Metro rail network will run from Chatswood in the city’s north, under Sydney Harbour to the CBD and onto Sydenham and Bankstown. The new station will be located underground, running parallel to Pitt Street, and have entries from Park Street and Bathurst Street. Elliott was appointed transport minister in December following a reshuffle under new premier Dominic Perrottet.

3/2/2022,"Astronomers who thought they had discovered a black hole on our cosmic doorstep have said they were mistaken, instead revealing they have found a two-star system involving a stellar “vampire”. The system, known as HR 6819 in the constellation Telescopium, was in the headlines in 2020 when researchers announced it contained a black hole. At just 1,000 light years from Earth, it was the closest yet found to our planet. At the time the team behind the work said the presence of a black hole was necessary to make sense of the movement of two stars in the system, suggesting a black hole and one star orbited each other while the second star moved in a wider orbit. Now the researchers say they were mistaken: the black hole does not exist. Dietrich Baade, an emeritus astronomer at European Southern Observatory (ESO) and a co-author of the work, said just one blob of light was previously detected, containing the hallmarks of two stars. Since both stars are of similar brightness and the same age, they would normally have the same mass and would whirl each other around with similar, high velocity. “Since we saw that only one of the stars was whirled around at high velocity by some massive object, which we didn’t see, we assumed this unseen massive object to be a third body, namely a black hole,” he said. But other researchers disputed the idea, suggesting the system contained two stars alone, one of which had recently been stripped of mass by the second, sometimes called a stellar “vampire”, making the latter far more massive. Writing in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics, Baade and colleagues report how the groups teamed up to analyse fresh data from the ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) and Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VTLI). “Science should be about the open questions that everyone is trying to solve, and not about who was right and who was wrong,” said Dr Julia Bodensteiner, a co-author of the study from the ESO who proposed the “vampire star” explanation. If a black hole was indeed present, the two stars would be expected to have a large separation. However, in the scenario with no black hole, the stars would be expected to be much closer together. The results from the VLT revealed no indication of a second star in a wide orbit. In addition the data suggested that both stars contributed to light captured from a single bright source – again suggesting they were sitting close to each other. The findings were further backed up by data from the VLTI, which in addition revealed that the two stars were orbiting each other. “Because the stripped star had lost most of its mass, the second star can reel it around quite easily while its effect on the other star is equally easily missed,” said Baade. While the findings scotch the idea of a black hole, the researchers remain upbeat. “The stripped star is even more exciting than the black hole because it was caught in a phase that lasts only a very small fraction of the total lifetime of the system,” said Baade. “The excitement is not about the low chances of the discovery but about the stripped star revealing the inner part of the star. The stripping has removed the thick intransparent curtain of the outer layers so that we can look much closer to where the star has generated the energy that it is radiating away and has synthesised new elements.” Baade added that when such elements were ejected, the stardust could form not only new stars but also planets and their inhabitants.",News/Science,"Black hole that was closest yet found does not exist, say scientists in U-turn",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/02/black-hole-that-was-closest-yet-found-does-not-exist-say-scientists-in-u-turn
