12/22/2021,"Senior EU officials are working behind the scenes to “correct” a new law in Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH) that criminalises denial of the massacre of 8,000 Muslims in Srebrenica, after privately concluding it risks reigniting fresh regional conflict. Milorad Dodik, the Serb member of the tripartite BiH leadership, has been accused in recent months of seeking to break up the country by withdrawing its Serbian part from state-level institutions.  He has claimed there is an imbalance of power and that when Valentin Inzko, the outgoing head of Bosnia’s office of the high representative, outlawed genocide denial this summer, it was undemocratic and symptomatic of the problem. Dodik’s moves to take back powers have been widely condemned by the international community, which accuses him of leading the region to war, but leaked minutes reveal that the European commissioner for enlargement, Olivér Várhelyi, has concluded that Inzko’s law is responsible for the current crisis. During a meeting with EU delegation to Bosnia, Várhelyi – who is responsible for strengthening the bloc’s relations with BiH – gave his “frank assessment” that Inzko “was to blame for the current political crisis” in the country and the “delegitimisation” of the office of the high representative. “While the Inzko amendments could not be disputed from the point of view of the law’s substance, the fact that it was imposed on the last day of the HR Inzko’s mandate had been problematic,” the minutes report Várhelyi as saying at the meeting on 25 November. “Especially because it was an important decision, it should have been based on thorough debate having everyone on board. The question was now how to correct this.” Várhelyi, a Hungarian close to his country’s rightwing prime minister Viktor Orbán, told his fellow EU officials that the Bosnian Muslim leadership had signalled willingness to resolve this issue through the adoption of a new law that could bring Dodik and the Serbian Republika Srpska entity back into the fold. The Dayton peace accord of 1994 ended a civil war that cost about 100,000 lives after the breakup of Yugoslavia, including that of more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys killed in and around the town of Srebrenica. The agreement established a new constitution for BiH, made up of two entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, consisting predominantly of Bosnian Muslims and Croats, and Republika Srpska. Bosnia’s three-member presidency is held by representatives of those three main ethnic groups. The so-called Bonn powers of 1997 also grant substantial lawmaking powers to the office of the high representative in charge of implementing the deal. It has the authority to impose decisions or dismiss officials who undermine the postwar ethnic balance and reconciliation efforts. Inzko, an Austrian diplomat, made genocide denial punishable by up to five years in prison in July. He cited a refusal by the Bosnian Serb assembly to withdraw decorations awarded to three convicted war criminals as part of his reasoning. The minutes reveal that Várhelyi said he believed there was a way out of the current crisis and that he had sanctioned a special sitting of Republika Srpska’s assembly on 10 December where members backed a resolution supporting the taking back of powers. His condition, however, was that the legislation required to take back powers from the state in the fields of tax administration, the judiciary, intelligence and even the national army, in order to create a Serb force, should be postponed for six months to allow time for negotiation. Várhelyi said that dealing with the genocide law was vital in order to get Dodik to recognise Inzko’s successor, Christian Schmidt of Germany, who has said the region faces its biggest crisis in a quarter of a century.

12/22/2021,"Heartbroken families are being forced to cancel Christmas and holiday plans as Queensland Covid testing requirements leave them locked out or turned away. Almost 260,000 Australians have crossed the border into Queensland since Monday but many more have been turned away and sent home or forced to cancel family reunions and expensive holiday bookings because of testing delays.  To enter Queensland, travellers are required to return a negative Covid test 72 hours before arrival, leaving thousands scrambling to get a test before travelling and placing extraordinary pressure on health systems in the lead-up to Christmas. The scramble for tests has led to delays in results being issued. It comes as the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, stood by the border restrictions, but said she was considering allowing rapid antigen tests for interstate travellers from 1 January. “I have had a good talk with the NSW premier [about] rapid antigen tests. We will look at whether this is approved, and we may legalise them in the New Year, but between now and the New Year we will require those PCR test for people coming into a state. “It was part of our plan, and we want to keep the virus out as much as we possibly can over Christmas and New Year.” There were 151,443 tests processed in New South Wales on Tuesday, the highest tally of swabs collected in more than four months, as the Christmas travel rush slows the system. Palaszczuk told reporters that 10% of those tests were for people making their way to Queensland, but NSW Health has not commented or confirmed that figure. The Queensland deputy premier, Steven Miles, said on Tuesday there would not be an extension of the 72-hour test window. He said he was aware of the long wait times to even get the test interstate. Casey Van Soest, her partner, Luke Van Soest, and daughter Xara Wademan, from Sydney’s south-west, are all stuck waiting at the NSW side of the border after a delay in their test results. Casey’s mother, Colleen Anne Collier, fears she will not be able to see her family, with their 72-hour window to present their tests about to expire. “It’s left me feeling frustrated and worried for the kids because they are literally sitting outside in the hot sun waiting for test results to come back. They have two of the three results, but are waiting on the third one. “They’ve left their accommodation that they stayed in last night, in anticipation that the results would be back by now. The plan was to travel on today over the border but no one has told them when to expect the results back. “Some people have been at the border waiting five days for their results. They can’t go forwards or backwards, although my daughter is considering turning around now. We haven’t seen her in two years for Christmas and it’s just heartbreaking.” Collier said her daughter and her family booked accommodation near the border and left Sydney after getting tested on Monday, anticipating they’d get the results before crossing. But with accommodation being snapped up by the many travellers in similar situations, they have had to resort to waiting in their car for the results. “They’ve already spent so much on this, and planned to get here for Christmas. And they’re particularly wanting to come this year because my father has probably six to nine months left, he’s in kidney failure at the moment and is 90 years old. “For us, this could be the last Christmas with him, and we want it to happen. If they don’t have a test result by Thursday evening, I think they could turn around.” Tourism operators are also reporting cancellations due to testing uncertainty. The Queensland Tourism Industry Council chief executive, Daniel Gschwind, said the current testing regime had dampened many operators’ optimistic outlook for the summer. There are reports up to 10% of Cairns bookings have been cancelled. “It is absolutely exhausting to face hurdle after hurdle, and just when relief was in sight, to be frustrated by the logistics of this requirement is definitely a concern. “The situation is obviously not helpful, and is acting as a deterrent. But we are still hoping demand will overwhelm concern at this point.” Gschwind said he hoped the Queensland government responded with some “flexibility” to the situation, citing rapid antigen tests or increased testing capacity as potential solutions. “The logistics of the testing requirements are not working out the way we would hope so that’s absolutely an issue.” “We are aware that some bookings have been cancelled in some parts of Queensland and hopefully that can be avoided in the future. We are still hopeful and optimistic that Christmas and the next month will deliver a strong boost to the tourism industry in Queensland.”",News/Australia news,‘Heartbroken’ travellers locked out of Queensland for Christmas due to Covid testing delays ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/22/heartbroken-travellers-locked-out-of-queensland-for-christmas-due-to-covid-testing-delays
