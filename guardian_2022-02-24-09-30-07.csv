2/24/2022,"Daniel Sturridge has made just five appearances as a substitute since signing for Perth Glory and now the former Liverpool striker is facing a further frustrating spell on the sidelines after sustaining an injury – blamed on a rushed warm-up – which curtailed his latest attempt to make an impact on the A-League Men. Sturridge, who in October last year was hailed by Glory owner Tony Sage as one of the biggest signings in A-League history, has struggled for time on the pitch due to the fitness issues that have plagued his career combined with three separate stints in quarantine since arriving in Australia.  The latest blow came during Wednesday’s 1-0 defeat to Macarthur in Launceston, where the 32-year-old, on as a second-half substitute, lasted just 18 minutes before pulling up clutching his groin after stretching to control a through pass. “I keep trying to bring him back and he keeps breaking down,” Glory coach Richard Garcia said. “We’ve got to get to grips with it and find out where he’s at. He keeps getting to certain stages ... we’ll have to wait and see how this one turns up. Hopefully it’s nothing.” During his latest cameo, Sturridge had a golden chance to open his ALM account and draw his side back on level terms after Ulises Davila had put Macarthur ahead in the ninth minute, but with the goal at his mercy he pulled his shot wide of the mark. Shortly after, he limped off the pitch, with Garcia later suggesting a lack of a proper warm-up during the half-time break was to blame. “We had him in at half-time, and then he did it so quickly that maybe he didn’t have enough time to warm up,” Garcia said. “He’s disappointed. We’ve got to take a look at it. Hopefully, it’s not as bad as it felt. He’s a pretty strong guy. He’s had these injuries before. It’s just about him coming back from it.” Defeat for Perth left them in 10th place, seven points off a place in the top six, although Garcia’s side do have games in hand on every team above them. They play table-topping Western United on Sunday in their last outing in Tasmania before heading back to Perth for a run of three home games at HBF Stadium.",Sport/Football,‘He keeps breaking down’: Daniel Sturridge injury extends Perth Glory frustration,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/24/he-keeps-breaking-down-daniel-sturridge-injury-extends-perth-glory-frustration
2/24/2022,"With high Covid vaccination rates and the numbers of cases and rate of hospitalisations falling overall in many parts of Australia, we are starting to see the relaxation of mask mandates. This is yet another sign that we are moving one step closer to living with Covid.  In terms of continuing to mandate the wearing of masks in high-risk environments such as public transport, hospitals and aged care centres, this is entirely appropriate, backed by evidence, and proportionate to the risk of transmission in these settings, even as the overall risk of infection in the population falls. Mask wearing remains an extremely effective and low-cost measure that has a significant impact on the risk of passing on infection and being infected. It has also been speculated that mask wearing, by potentially reducing the viral dose that individuals are exposed to if they do get infected, may impact on the severity of illness and possibly even the likelihood of developing long Covid. One of the important and perhaps somewhat obvious points to make is that the removal of mask mandates in lower-risk settings does not mean that you are not allowed to wear a mask in these settings. You still have the option, as you have always had, to factor in your personal circumstances and your tolerance for risk and take whatever extra precautions you feel you need to protect yourself from infection in any situation. This includes the option to don a mask whenever and wherever you feel this provides that additional level of reassurance you need. Mandates prescribe the minimums in terms of mitigation behaviours required of the community and do not restrict what individuals can decide to do that go over and above these minimum requirements. There are many ways in which this pandemic will have changed our society forever. While some of the ways are yet to be appreciated, it seems clear that in western societies the pandemic has led to the normalisation of mask wearing. Something that was viewed as peculiar pre-pandemic is now considered very much a normal part of our lives and will remain so as we learn to live with the virus.  Hassan Vally is an associate professor of epidemiology at Deakin University While there are still relatively high levels of Covid transmission occurring in the community, there are still settings where masks are needed – those with particularly high risk of transmission, or where the consequences of transmission are greatest. Places where we spend a reasonable amount of time with strangers in closed airspace, such as public transport and shared vehicles, remain on the list, as are the higher-risk settings including the prison system, healthcare, disability and aged care. Larger musical indoor events carry a different kind of risk, with many in the audience singing along, and so masks are still required. There are some state differences in easing mask mandates. In New South Wales, masks will no longer need to be worn by students or high school staff from Monday. Teachers and staff members at primary schools and early childcare centres will need to wear face masks until 7 March. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said her government would relax the requirement to wear masks in most indoor settings, including workplaces, schools, shops, cafes, restaurants and pubs, from 4 March. Victoria is keeping rules in place for front-of-house hospitality workers given their exposure as they engage with patrons. The most discussed inconsistency is the Victorian decision to keep masks on in school, but only for primary school children from grade three up. These rules are under constant review which is a good thing, and the World Health Organization has provided a checklist to ensure that masks rules for kids are proportionate. The risk of exposure will also vary across different parts of the country, with some local government areas in Victoria, for instance, having a tenfold lower infection rate at the moment, so we might also see some of the remaining rules lifted sooner in particularly low-risk areas. However, some mask rules may be here to stay – those in very high-risk settings, especially within hospitals where there are very vulnerable patients, and where masks reduce exposure to a range of respiratory pathogens. Finally, no mask rules does not mean don’t wear masks: when around others and unable to keep our distance, a mask can make the difference between staying virus-free or picking up Covid or, as we move out of summer, catching a cold, or the flu.

2/24/2022,"When the Augar review of post-18 education and funding in England was announced by former prime minister Theresa May in February 2018, it was seen by many as a kneejerk response to Labour’s better than expected performance in the 2017 general election, buoyed up Jeremy Corbyn’s pledge to scrap student tuition fees. It was a time of mounting concern about spiralling levels of student debt and the loss of maintenance grants for the most disadvantaged. But while those concerns rightly persist today, the overriding drive behind the reforms unveiled by the government on Thursday will undoubtedly have been to lower the cost to the Treasury of financing England’s increasingly unwieldy student loan system.  The figures are eye-watering. According to the Department for Education, the value of outstanding loans by the end of March 2021 was £161bn and it is forecast to rise to half a trillion pounds by 2043. To help tackle the debt, the student loan repayment period will be extended to 40 years and the repayment threshold lowered to £25,000. It will hit graduates – particularly lower earning graduates – hard, but will save the Treasury and the taxpayer billions. But behind the long-awaited finance reforms, there has also been a shift away from the idea of university as the best choice for all students and a rowing back on earlier Labour ambitions to get 50% of 18-year-olds into universities. A new consultation on a minimum qualification requirement to access loans to go to university has already been branded an attack on social mobility and disadvantaged students. Under the proposals, students who fail to gain a grade 4 GCSE pass in maths and English, or two E grades at A-level, will be blocked from accessing student loans and therefore going to university. In 2021 fewer than 5,000 students entered higher education without GCSE passes in English and maths. In a briefing to the media, higher and further education minister, Michelle Donelan insisted it was not a “definite” direction of travel: “But it is something that I think it’s right that we explore as an option. We used to have an entry requirement in this country of two Es,” she said. “We all know that there are young people that get three Es every year that feel compelled and pushed to go to university before they’re ready, and I think that that is doing them a disservice.” The government will also be keen to use its reforms to crack down on what they describe as “low value” courses which they say saddle students with debt while doing little to increase their earnings – and crucially their ability to pay off their loans. The government is keen for students to study the kind of degrees which will guarantee graduate earnings. There is also a new consultation seeking views on a lifelong loan entitlement for people to retrain flexibly at any time in their lives, worth the equivalent of £37,000, or four years of post-18 education. According to one sector insider it could be “the most significant education reform of the 2020s so far”, though it may well end up being significantly watered down. While the headlines will focus on changes to loan repayments and minimum entry requirements, the government’s reforms also include interesting plans to cut the cost of foundation year courses and a new national state scholarship to support high-achieving students from disadvantaged backgrounds access higher education, further education and apprenticeships. “Overall, people who hate the government will claim today’s package lets students, graduates and universities down,” said Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute and a key government adviser when the current loan system was set up. “Meanwhile, those who love the government will claim it is a bold set of reforms. In reality, it is a quite carefully balanced package that sends some powerful signals about the government’s priorities.”",News/Education,UK government prioritising savings in review of post-18 education ,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/24/uk-government-prioritising-savings-in-review-of-post-18-education
2/24/2022,"After four Olympic Games, seven gold and two silver medals, Sir Jason Kenny, Britain’s most decorated Olympian, has announced his retirement. Kenny admitted a certain amount of reluctance as he heads into coaching as Team GB’s sprint coach. For now, at least, he remains the most successful Olympian in his own household as well.  Kenny, who was knighted in the New Year Honours List after his memorable triumph in the kierin in Tokyo last summer saw him claim yet another Olympic title, formally began work as British Cycling’s men’s podium sprint coach this week. He said the decision had been taken jointly with his wife Dame Laura Kenny, Britain’s most successful female Olympian, who won her fifth gold with victory in the Madison alongside Katie Archibald last summer, and he hopes the new role will allow him more quality time with their son Albie, who turned four last August. Laura is expected to target Paris 2024 for her fourth Olympics where she will be the same age, 33, that her husband is now. “It wasn’t an easy decision,” said Kenny. “I genuinely wanted to carry on to Paris, but I creak quite a lot these days and I always knew I wanted to go into coaching off the back of it, and this opportunity came along. I am a little bit sad to be honest because all I’ve known is riding and competing, but I’m quite excited to get stuck into the job.”He added: “Athletes’ days off are not really off - you’re planning for the next day,” he said. “It basically consists of not doing anything too arduous and fuelling right … you can’t just go and play football with Albie or whatever. Now I think I’ll have less time off but I’ll be able to enjoy it more.” Having previously racked up six gold medals and two silvers from his appearances in Beijing, London and Rio, Kenny stepped away from the sport for a year before deciding to head to his fourth Games. The 33-year-old had conceded he was “struggling” during the men’s sprint in Tokyo but saved arguably his most thrilling performance in the keirin for what turned out to be the final race of his professional career. The victory meant he surpassed both Sir Chris Hoy and Sir Bradley Wiggins as Britain’s most successful Olympian, with Kenny also becoming most decorated cyclist in Olympic history. Asked if winning his specialist event in Tokyo was the perfect way to sign off, he said: “It is. I’m dead happy with that. It was really special. To do it on that bike, the last day of the Olympics, for me that’s a really special moment in time. If I could have picked a day to end on, that would be the one.” Kenny replaces Scott Pollock, who had served as sprint coach in an interim role following the dismissal of Kevin Stewart in November 2020 for “inappropriate relationships” with riders.

2/24/2022,"Students in England will have to pay back university loans over 40 years instead of 30 under swingeing reforms designed to save the Treasury tens of billions of pounds. The number of students expected to pay back their loan in full is expected to double from under a quarter (23%) to more than half (52%) as a result of the changes, which will see many graduates paying for their degree until retirement in what was described as a “lifelong graduate tax”.  In a move designed to sugar the pill, interest rates on student loans will be slashed for new borrowers and set at no higher than the rate of inflation from next year – but experts said this would disproportionately benefit higher earning graduates. The controversial measures form the backbone of the government’s long-awaited response to the Augar review of post-18 education and funding, which will be detailed in a statement to parliament on Thursday. In a double whammy, graduates will also be asked to start paying off their debt sooner after the government confirmed the repayment threshold will be cut from £27,295 to £25,000 for new borrowers starting courses from September 2023. Annual tuition fees will be capped at £9,250 for a further two years, keeping costs down for students but hitting universities, which have seen the value of tuition fees eroded over the years due to inflation. The Department for Education (DfE) said the changes would “rebalance the burden of student loans more fairly between the student and the taxpayer and ensure that in future graduates don’t pay back more than they borrowed in real terms”. But Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, warned that most university leavers would pay thousands of pounds more for their degrees over their lifetime than they do now. “It’s effectively a lifelong graduate tax for most,” he said. “Only around a quarter of current [university] leavers are predicted to earn enough to repay in full now. Extending this period means the majority of lower and mid earners will keep paying for many more years, increasing their costs by thousands. Yet the highest earners who would clear [their debt] within the current 30 years won’t be impacted.” Bridget Phillipson, Labour’s shadow education secretary, accused the government of delivering another stealth tax for new graduates which will hit those on low incomes hardest. The student finance measures are aimed at stemming the soaring cost of student loans. At the end of March last year the value of outstanding loans stood at £161bn and is forecast to rise to about £500bn by 2043, the DfE said. While currently the department anticipates that graduates will pay back 59p in every £1 over the lifetime of their loans, under the reforms the DfE calculates borrowers will repay 81p, with a graduate earning £28,000 repaying about £17 a month. In addition to the changes to student finance, the government will also launch two consultations on Thursday. The first will seek views on controversial proposals to introduce minimum eligibility requirements to access student loans – either by requiring students to have a grade 4 pass in GCSE English and maths, or two Es at A-level – and student number controls to clamp down on what the government describes as poor-quality, low-cost courses. The second sets out plans for a lifelong loan entitlement for the equivalent of four years of post-18 education (£37,000 in today’s fees) to support students to study at any stage in their life through modular courses. Announcing the reforms, the education secretary Nadhim Zahawi said: “This package of reforms will ensure students are being offered a range of different pathways, whether that is higher or further education, that lead to opportunities with the best outcomes – and put an end once for all to high interest rates on their student loans.” Higher and further education minister Michelle Donelan added: “We are delivering a fairer system for students, graduates and taxpayers as well as future-proofing the student finance system.” Sir Philip Augar, who chaired the original post-18 education review, welcomed the reforms which he described as fair and sustainable. “The package … forms the basis of a properly connected further and higher education sector. That connection is long overdue,” he said. But Larissa Kennedy, president of the UK National Union of Students, said: “The minister is saddling young people with unimaginable debt for the next 40 years of their lives. This is nothing more than an attack on opportunity.”",Lifestyle/Money,Students in England to pay back loans over 40 years instead of 30 ,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/24/students-in-england-to-pay-back-loans-over-40-years-instead-of-30
2/24/2022,"Supermarkets should stop selling fresh produce such as apples and potatoes in plastic packaging, research suggests, because it does not make them last longer and adds to pollution and food waste. The 18-month study by the sustainability charity Wrap, which also looked at sales of bananas, broccoli and cucumbers, debunks the idea that single-use plastic wrappers help prevent waste.  Instead, this packaging often forces people to buy more than they need, increasing the problem of wasted food. Marcus Gover, Wrap’s chief executive, said that while packaging was important and often carried out a critical role to protect food, its research had found that plastic wrap “doesn’t necessarily prolong the life of uncut fresh produce”, adding: “It can in fact increase food waste in this case.” Britons throw away almost half a million tonnes of fresh vegetables and salad and a quarter of a million tonnes of fresh fruit – worth a total of £2.1bn – each year because it has gone soft or mouldy, or the date label has expired. This waste is bad for the planet: about one-third of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions are associated with food and drink. In the battle with food waste, packaging was found to be a less important part of the picture than other factors, such as enabling people to buy the right amount or how it was stored. “We found that storing food in the fridge at below five degrees gave days, weeks, and, in the case of apples, months more quality product life,” said Gover. “We found that for most items, the plastic packaging they were sold in made little or no difference to their shelf life. “In cases where consumers had no choice but to buy more than they needed in pre-packed packaging, this could actually increase food waste,” he added. Wrap studied the five items: apples, bananas, broccoli, cucumber and potatoes, stored in the original packaging and loose, and at different temperatures. It calculated that if these five products were sold loose, and the best-before dates removed, it could save more than 10,300 tonnes of plastic and about 100,000 tonnes of food from being wasted each year – the equivalent of 14m shopping baskets of food. The food waste was prevented because people bought the right amount and used their judgment, rather than date labels, to decide if food was still good. One in 10 people dump groceries based on the date, resulting in good food being thrown out. Most supermarkets sell some of these items loose already but Wrap, whose work helps shape government policy on sustainability matters, said its research presented compelling evidence for a wider range of fruit and veg to be sold this way. As people faced rising fuel and food prices, there was a compelling economic as well as environmental case for ringing the changes in grocery aisles, Gover said, and retailers should step up and act on Wrap’s findings. “This helps save the planet and us money at the same time,” he said. Wrap conceded it would take time for things to change and it will now consult the Food Standards Agency, Defra, and the food industry to make loose produce in supermarkets a reality by 2025.",News/Environment,"Plastic packaging increases fresh food waste, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/24/plastic-packaging-increases-fresh-food-waste-study-finds
2/24/2022,"When Ikea bought the former Kings Mall two years ago, more than a quarter of stores in the run-down Hammersmith shopping centre stood empty. On Thursday, the Swedish furniture giant’s £170m experiment on the west London shopping mall will be tested with the opening of Livat, its first city centre shopping mall globally and the first to be refurbished rather than built from scratch.  While Ikea has 47 other shopping centres worldwide, at 37,000sq metres Livat is just over a third of the size of its typical site and its first in the UK. Livat also houses Ikea’s only high street store in the UK – which is a quarter the size of a typical store. The former Kings Mall is now fully let, with new tenants including German discount supermarket Lidl, a Library of Things (a social enterprise) and Sook, the rent-by-the hour retail or events space, alongside an Ikea’s outlet. “This is the first step on our journey to develop more city centre locations,” said Cindy Andersen, managing director of Ikea’s property arm Ingka Centres, which bought the 1980s site. “This was a perfect opportunity to refurbish and existing location which has been established for a long time and taking the next step to put some new energy into the place.” The mall, which Ikea spent £170m on buying and redeveloping, will include a small market hall for local food pop-ups alongside Ikea’s own Swedish Deli and two further cafes offering meatballs, open sandwiches and coffees. Brightly coloured seating on a stairway below a repaved atrium will lead to a locally run cafe above the mall, which sits beside a revamped outdoor space for council tenants in the residential block above, with a wildflower meadow, seating and planters. The project is a bold bet on a post-Covid world. It paves the way for the redevelopment of the former Topshop flagship on London’s Oxford Street, which will reopen as Ikea next autumn as the Swedish group plans to spend £1bn on expanding in the capital over the next three years. Andersen said Ikea was “actively searching” for more urban sites to redevelop in cities in the UK and across Europe and North America. Later this year, Ikea will breathe new life into San Francisco’s 6X6 “ghost mall” which has lain empty since it was completed in 2016. The group is meanwhile redeveloping Toronto’s Aura Podium which formerly housed a branch of Bed, Bath & Beyond and some restaurants. The Hammersmith store opens a year later than expected after works to knock through smaller stores and a former Debenhams and a basement area, which was once several stockrooms, took longer than expected during the pandemic. Peter Jelkeby, the manager of Ikea’s UK retail business, said the retailer would look at a range of opportunities to fill in gaps and make the furnishings store more accessible in London as shopping habits change. More than 44% of the group’s UK sales were online last year compared to 19% in 2019. “We need to be agile,” he said, pointing to the group’s experiments with lockers where shoppers can pick up products in Twickenham and Kingston, west London. If the idea proves popular 20 more sites are on the cards in London by the end of this year. “Hammersmith is a new way to reach consumers. It is going to be accessible to quite different shopping behaviour … I am optimistic about physical [store] space but it needs to be in harmony with digital sales.” He said Ikea expected the furniture market to continue to grow, even if there was a slow down from the “extreme demand” for certain kinds of products, such as desks and office chairs, which was seen during the pandemic lockdowns and the switch to working from home. “It’s a volatile market but we are fairly optimistic,” Jelkeby said. He admitted that securing supply and transport of a whole range of products was “still challenging” and it was not clear how long the issues would last. Ikea said it expects price inflation of 10% to 11% in the UK and Ireland this year, although some products have risen by as much as 50%. Jelkeby said: “We have been absorbing a lot of cost increases and inflation is going to [continue] to be around us. We will continue to become more efficient and the consumer will decide if we are competitive.” Ikea’s Hammersmith store is a step on from Ikea’s previous high street formats in the UK, all of which have now closed, such as the small store based around planning kitchens or bathrooms in central London’s Tottenham Court Road and Bromley, south-east London. The store, which houses 18 room sets, compared to more than 30 in a typical Ikea store, featuring large items that can be ordered for home delivery as well as room design services and 1,800 different smaller items to takeaway, from mugs, artificial plants and kitchen kit to technology such as lamps featuring a Sonos smart speaker. The biggest item that can be taken home immediately is a coffee table.",News/Business,Ikea opens first city centre shopping mall in west London,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/24/ikea-opens-first-city-centre-shopping-mall-in-west-london
2/24/2022,"There was a moment just before half-time at Wanda Metropolitano when Cristiano Ronaldo stood on the penalty spot, delivered a shrug of the shoulders, pulled a face and raised a finger. None of his Manchester United teammates were really looking his way and even if they had been, there was little they could do about it, and so he walked slowly back out of the area, shaking his head, alone. It was a journey he would embark upon often. All the way to the end, in fact, when he was the first player off, throwing back his arm in frustration, born perhaps not just of this night but other nights too, an uncomfortably familiar feeling of impotence, a hint of recrimination there too. Pausing to applaud the fans in the north stand, Ronaldo crossed the pitch and turned up the tunnel on his own. United had found a way through, Anthony Elanga slipping past Jan Oblak with 10 minutes to go, but the goal he wanted never came on his return to the city where he won it all.  At least defeat was not delivered either, he and his team handed the chance to fight another day. As he had walked away from the penalty spot, Ronaldo had watched Atlético escape up the left, Renan Lodi delivering another superb ball across the Manchester United box. At the far post, Sime Vrsaljko headed it off the face of Victor Lindelöf and it bounced down and up off the bar. It was almost comical, and they had got away with it. It was becoming that kind of game. Ronaldo was the last one off at the break. He was having words with the referee then and would surely be having words with his teammates next. Atlético led by a goal, and for United that was the good news. It wasn’t so much that they had been overrun, although they had, as that at times it was as if they had put their legs on the wrong way around, the ball given away easily and often, simple tasks unfulfilled. Fred had been extremely fortunate to get away with one, somehow getting a free-kick when he had been the offender as Geoffrey Kondogbia was running through. Ángel Correa almost caught Raphaël Varane, the former Real Madrid player completing only half of his passes. Even goal-kicks were a problem, the ball gifted inside the area. United put together a half-decent move on the hour, Ronaldo at the heart of it. When Marcus Rashford smashed a long way over from a long way out, it summed things up. This really wasn’t very good. Ronaldo had watched too much of it from a distance, at one point waving his teammates forward. He has put many clubs to the sword but he has hurt Atlético almost more than any other team. A goal in the 2014 Champions League final. The winning penalty two years later. A hat-trick in the semi-final two years after that. And two years after that – the last time he faced them – he scored another hat‑trick to knock them out. He has scored against them 25 times. Twenty-five times it would stay. Ronaldo had been whistled when the teams were read out and was whistled every time he got the ball, which spoke of many emotions, fear among them, although that gradually faded. In the sports newspaper AS, this had been declared a Cock Fight between him and João Félix. It was the other Portuguese, 15 years his junior, who would light up the occasion, scoring with a superb diving header to give Atlético an early lead. He was withdrawn to an ovation with 15 minutes to go. Ronaldo had pulled up with cramp – he lasted longer but could not change this game. More than moments, there were gestures, gesticulaton, although he might have got his moment at the end. A late free-kick, generously awarded, brought that familiar routine: six steps back, two steps to the side, a deep breath. This seemed set up, the story about to write itself, but the ball sailed over. It was done. With 30 seconds remaining Ronaldo went down in the right corner, no foul given, left sitting there, arms outstretched. He got up, and stood by Jan Oblak as the goalkeeper booted the last of many long balls up the pitch to no one in particular. And then he walked out of there. Ronaldo had demanded one, just one. He didn’t get it, but at least United did. Last time he was here, Ronaldo had left the stadium raising four fingers as he went past the press. He had won four Champions Leagues to their none, he reminded them, as if they needed telling. He hadn’t enjoyed that night either, unable to score here, but he had scored three in the return leg. No, that doesn’t seem likely now – one would do.",Sport/Football,Ronaldo falls short against his favourite opponent in city where he won it all | Sid Lowe,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/23/ronaldo-demands-one-but-gets-none-on-frustrating-return-to-atletico
