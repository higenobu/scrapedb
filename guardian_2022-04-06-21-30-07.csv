4/6/2022,"If you brought up children in the 2010s, the Lego video games were probably as big a part of your family downtime as Pixar and Peppa Pig. From the original Lego Star Wars in 2005 to the wonderful Lego Marvel Super Heroes, the series has expertly followed the trends of blockbuster franchised entertainment, converting even the darkest moments of Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter into slapstick interactive diversions, as entertaining to parents as they were to children. What really marked the titles out, though, was their multiplayer, which provided a safe space for children to learn the fundaments of the action adventure genre in the company of their parents and siblings – from accurate jumping to puzzle solving to melee combat. Now a whole new generation will have that pleasure. Taking players on a mammoth journey through all nine of the movies, The Skywalker Saga treats each episode as a mini-adventure that closely follows the narrative of the film, adding extra sequences to enhance the playability and puzzle-solving fun. You can take on the trilogies in any order, though you always have to start with the opening chapter, so you can’t just skip to The Empire Strikes Back without completing A New Hope. Wherever you choose to begin, you get a breathless, often laugh-out-loud thrill ride, filled with the sorts of visual gags and slapstick asides that have made the series so hugely successful. Take a wrong turn in the Death Star and you’ll discover Stormtroopers doing a tai chi class; explore Cloud City and you’ll find where Lando Calrissian keeps his vast collection of fancy cloaks. It’s worth playing just for the excellent cinematics, which often nod slyly toward longstanding fan debates and talking points. The finale of The Force Awakens, for example, has a grief-stricken Chewbacca running to embrace Leia, who appears set to return his affection, only to leg it right past him and hug Rey. The “who shot first” controversy from the Mos Eisley cantina also gets a ridiculous new spin. Each world is beautifully constructed, taking advantage of the power of modern hardware. The battle at Maz Kanata’s castle takes place in the bright evening sun, with lens flare glinting off incoming fighter craft, while Coruscant provides a vast, vertigo-inducing metropolis of bustling streets and looming skyscrapers. The spaceships are designed to resemble real-life Lego models and they’re so intricately built, it’s a pleasure just watching them swoop overhead. The episodes are light on puzzles, and you’re never going to be stuck for longer than a few minutes. It’s often about working out how to use the special skills of each member of your party; Rey can build gadgets such as gliders and net throwers, while Han Solo can analyse mechanical systems to trigger traps and explosions. Combat is soft too. Your characters have generous health reserves and a mix of blasters, lightsabers and melee moves that crush most enemies with ease. There are slightly more demanding boss battles, including a long tussle with the trash compactor monster and a multi-stage showdown against Kylo Ren, but we’re not talking Elden Ring here. More advanced players will discover a gentle role-playing element: the different character classes all get skill trees, so you can open up new abilities as you go, and there’s a combo system to bring depth to fist and lightsaber fights. But if your kid just wants to spam the attack button, the game isn’t going to punish them. Difficulty has never really been the point, after all. These are games you just want to experience and share, and it’s nice to be carried along on a wave of silly japes and pinpoint-accurate references to Star Wars lore. And even though each of the episodes can be completed in little over an hour, there are lots of open, explorable areas that reveal side quests and other hidden extras. Once you’re done, you can fly around the galaxy, landing on any of the planets you fancy. Obsessive fans will also want to collect all 380 different characters. Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is a well-made and highly entertaining addition to this long, long series. It’s not doing anything radically new with the recipe, but it doesn’t really need to – this is a game about nostalgia, not just for Star Wars but for the Lego games themselves. These games have always sought to conjure our favourite family movie franchises as we choose to remember them, shorn of all the boring, indulgent and problematic bits. My god, even The Phantom Menace is bearable here. For this feat alone, the game deserves the attention of fans and families throughout the galaxy.

4/6/2022,"Some Stephen Sondheim flops – Assassins, Merrily We Roll Along – received such admiration on revival that they became core repertory. However, London’s first Sondheim musical since the composer’s death in November is a show that not only got away but stayed there: Anyone Can Whistle, pulled after nine Broadway performances in 1964, remains an elusive curiosity. A measure of the mess it became is that the best song, There Won’t Be Trumpets, imagining how a Messiah may arrive, was cut in New York to save time, but, after becoming a cabaret standard, restored to the score. Sondheim’s second professional musical as both composer and lyricist (after A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum) and his first not based on an existing literary text, Anyone Can Whistle is an absurdist political satire set in dramatist Arthur Laurents’ imaginary town bankrupted by corrupt Mayor Cora, whose gormless entourage conjure a fake miracle of water pouring from a rock. The fillip from pilgrims brings visitors including shrink Dr Hapgood (later referenced as a Stoppard title character), and Fay, a nurse who may have come from Lourdes to assess a rival shrine. The plot is absurd both as a theatrical genre and pejoratively, although with some serious intent: there are four references to Ibsen plays and, in reflections on the risk of putting faith in leaders, glimpses of the recent JFK assassination and the demagogic presidential run of Republican senator Barry Goldwater in the premiere year. The songs are most interesting for tryouts of rhyming and rhythm that Sondheim will later perfect. Simple, a 13-minute sequence of song, dialogue and action featuring a dozen performers, anticipates mature bravura montages in Pacific Overtures and Sunday in the Park With George. Somehow accomplishing Simple and other busy songs on a thin strip of stage, Georgie Rankcom’s production brilliantly gives the show new contexts. Psychedelic costumes (Cory Shipp) suggest how it anticipated (if satirically) “hippy” musicals of the next decade such as Godspell, Jesus Christ Superstar and Pippin. And, most transformationally, a local “lunatic asylum” (in the vernacular of then) becomes, through a young cast, four of whom identify in the programme as non-binary, explicitly a place where society confines those who won’t conform. Jordan Broatch, in their professional debut, is a blazingly engaging Hapgood, and Chrystine Symone gives soaring performances of the title number and Trumpets, making us glad Sondheim saw sense over that song’s excision, while Alex Young’s Mayor, adept at physical and vocal comedy, nails truths about political liars.

4/6/2022,"In 1995 musician Shannon Hoon died of an accidental cocaine overdose, leaving behind (like Kurt Cobain) a partner and infant daughter. But this collaged video diary, assembled from the camcorder archives Hoon shot between 1990 and his death as he rose to fame as lead singer of alt-rockers Blind Melon, is – cheeringly – not a grim trawl through the gutter of excess. Rather, it’s a quizzical time capsule of pre-internet fame from the perspective of a troubled but capable young man who knew his way around a camera. The brawny, snub-nosed Indiana native, often shooting through a fisheye lens, appears here as the boy in the bubble as he arrives in Los Angeles and quickly integrates into the city’s rock scene. Hoon sings backup vocals for Guns N’ Roses, and then Blind Melon’s jaunty strumalong hit No Rain, released in 1993 a year after their debut album, briefly makes them the toast of MTV. But amid this whirlwind, with the same pointed ability to spin the mundane that marked his lyrics, he constantly gravitates to the marginalia with his camera: a cat emerging from a flowerbed, a roadie sleeping in a laundry cart, Lenny Kravitz licking the lens. Blind Melon’s present-day status as 90s alt-rock also-rans means the main interest of All I Can Say lies in the nature of celebrity rather than the band itself. Viewed backwards down the kaleidoscope, the music-biz hullabaloo and rock posturing seem as quaint and obsolete as the many random cultural marker-posts, like a Rolling Stones song becoming the first to be released on CD-Rom. But Hoon is instinctively aware of this absurdity, complaining of the fuss over their iconic girl-in-a-bee-costume mascot: “I think people are analysing it way too deep.” (He’s lucky he wasn’t famous 30 years later.) At one point Hoon says that he hopes to move into film-making, and it’s true he has an eye. The film’s flotsam flow is of course the work of three other directors, but the original angles are Hoon’s; and many – like the shot dodging the wheels of a moving freight train – are adventurous. It can’t of course be taken at face value as the truth about his drug addiction or broader emotional life, but it is a fine portrait of a seeker wading through the human reality at the heart of fame.  All I Can Say is released in cinemas and on digital platforms on Friday.",Arts/Film,All I Can Say review – Shannon Hoon’s kaleidoscopic images of pre-internet fame,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/06/all-i-can-say-review-shannon-hoon-blind-melon
4/6/2022,"Most likely you won’t much warm to Samantha Fink (Sofia Black-D’Elia) when you first meet. She’s the titular single drunk female of this new show (Disney+), and the opening scene sees her stroll into work, late and inebriated, assault her terrified boss with a phone receiver, and then blame it all on “the patriarchy”. Alternatively, if you read that sentence and think “Wow, Sam sounds like a total ledge!”, Single Drunk Female may be the intervention you didn’t know you needed. Over the course of 10 half-hour episodes, Sam doesn’t just get sober, she stays that way. The story is closely based on the life of the show’s 35-year-old creator, Simone Finch, who was still drinking when she started work on the script in about 2012. It was only as she acknowledged her alcoholism that her alter ego Sam was able to evolve beyond the hot mess of post-Fleabag TV cliche. Subsequent drafts were read by Finch’s co-writers on the briefly revived Roseanne, and eventually attracted the interest of Girls co-showrunner Jenni Konner, plus Daisy Gardner (30 Rock, Californication) and Leslye Headland (Russian Doll), who together formed an executive-producing team. Single Drunk Female shows all these disparate influences. It is as at home in working-class America as Roseanne – only this time it’s the Boston suburb of Melrose, not Lanford, Illinois. Like Hannah from Girls, Sam also once eked out a living writing listicles for NYC-based online outlets with names like Douche and Smug Media, before she got herself fired. The most useful comparison, though, is with Russian Doll. That Natasha Lyonne-starring Netflix show (season two lands this month) used a trippy time-loop allegory to explore the repetitive nature of active addiction. Single Drunk Female, by contrast, is a direct, straightforward, even earnest story of sobriety. Which sounds boring, doesn’t it? How much dramatic mileage is there in herbal tea and moral inventory? Plenty, it turns out. It might help to think of this as a superior coming-of-age dramedy, since that’s essentially what recovery is: the process of learning, as a grownup, how to deal with all that difficult grownup stuff that boozing blunts or delays. How do you make new friends while sober? Or reconnect with old ones? How do you grieve a loss or celebrate a triumph without a glass in hand? How do you have sex, even? What do you do at the weekend? One of Single Drunk Female’s most sobering observations is that plenty of people who would never consider themselves problem drinkers still use booze to get through the day. As Sam’s mostly unhelpful mother, Carol (Ally Sheedy), says, while pouring out a large one: “Don’t judge me for having one glass of wine in the evening, because being a person is hard.” There’s no judgment here. As Sam begins to look beyond the rim of her shot-glass, she – and we – are rewarded with an expanded view of Carol and all the other people in her life. Characters such as Felicia, the responsible single mum who still knows how to paaardee haaard (I could listen to Lily Mae Harrington’s Boston vowels all day). Or uptight AA sponsor Olivia (Rebecca Henderson), her even more fastidious wife (Madeline Wise), and their oversized, overindulged cat, Joshie. Or supermarket manager Mindy (Jojo Brown), a sweet soul with a sharp wit. Conversely, it’s the rager scenes that turn out to be the least fun. The flashback episode in which we see how James (Garrick Bernard) reached rock bottom via a family Thanksgiving dinner and a toilet hook-up, is about as enjoyable as being the only sober person at the bar on St Patrick’s Day; the jokes don’t quite land and the moments of bonhomie feel forced. Bernard as James makes an excellent love interest for Samantha – emotional boundaries have never been so sexy! – but he’s not a very convincing drunk. Happily, this lapse only further confirms the rarity of Single Drunk Female. It’s a show that has most to say at the very point when other shows lose interest. TV has been fascinated by messy-but-beautiful, damaged-but-hot, lovelorn-but-sexually liberated women since Fleabag first arched an eyebrow to camera. Single Drunk Female demonstrates the hard-won emotional maturity of a recovering addict by allowing Sam to not only get her act together, but also become a little less tediously self-involved as a result. I’ll raise a mineral water to that.",Arts/Television & radio,Single Drunk Female review – this rare joy is like a next-level Fleabag,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/06/single-drunk-female-review-this-rare-joy-is-like-a-next-level-fleabag
4/6/2022,"Amid the triple crisis of the war in Ukraine, the still-raging pandemic and escalating inflation, climate scientists have just pulled off a truly impressive achievement. They have stood firm and persuaded the world’s governments to agree to a common guide to solving the climate emergency. Despite the despair of mounting global problems, the release of the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shows some grounds for hope. After the recent reports on the causes and effects of climate change, this one covers solutions – with a summary signed off by the world’s governments. The summary is blunt and clear, and in many places acknowledges realities that scientists and campaigners have known for years but governments often avoided directly admitting. First, it is clearly acknowledged that North America and Europe have made the greatest contribution to the crisis we are living through, by producing by far the most carbon dioxide emissions since the industrial revolution. The report shows that today the average North American emits 16 tonnes of carbon dioxide each year from fossil fuel use, compared to just 2 tonnes for the average African. Consumption by the top 10% of households comprises over a third of global of greenhouse gases, compared to 15% of these gases for the bottom 50% of households. Every government now agrees that the climate crisis is driven by how the world’s wealthy – which includes much of the UK’s population – currently live, consume and invest. This is a major leap forward compared to previous reports. The last IPCC summary on solutions in 2014 labelled population growth as one of “the most important drivers of increases in CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion”. Such dangerous misunderstandings are now gone. Seven years on, these old “blame the poor” arguments increasingly seem like a relic of a previous age. The new report is also admirably clear on how far governments are from meeting their commitments signed under the Paris agreement in 2015 and reaffirmed in Glasgow late last year. For all the UK government’s talk of “keeping 1.5 alive” in Glasgow, current climate policies and pledges will not limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, or keep it “well below” 2C, the dual Paris targets. Despite the the complexities of climate science, our course is terrifyingly simple to see: we are currently on track for catastrophic 3C heating. In a world where half of the its population is highly vulnerable to the climate crisis, that spells disaster. Extreme heatwaves, floods and droughts far outside the normal tolerances of cities and towns will destroy lives and livelihoods globally. The knock-on effects of crop failures, migration and economic disruption could then overload political institutions and our abilities to respond to unfolding events. If that feels depressing, there is cause for hope. Governments own this report. They have endorsed it, and they have signed it off. Their citizens can now hold them to account for the failures it details. The most heartening section of the report is on alternatives to fossil fuel use. The overarching solution to our energy needs is to electrify everything we can, from heating buildings to transport, and power everything using clean renewables and storage. We are getting a huge helping hand from great leaps forward in clean technology. Between 2010 and 2019, the report says that the cost of solar energy plummeted by 85%, wind energy by 55% and lithium-ion batteries by 85%. These are staggering figures that point to a radically reshaped energy future. With the tsunami of suffering that is about to engulf UK households from soaring energy costs set by skyrocketing gas prices, everyone in government needs to see this message. There is a cheaper, cleaner way. But the emissions problem is deeper than just failures to invest in low-carbon alternatives. The world already has enough existing and planned high-carbon infrastructure to blast past 1.5C. Retiring big emitters, such as coal-fired power stations, is needed. Plus, planned new oil fields and airports that lock in high emissions need cancelling. This report is essentially a manifesto for ending the fossil fuel age. It will help the growing mass of people fighting against the fossil fuel industry on many fronts – but especially those taking official channels, such as MPs lobbying government not to open new oil fields, lawyers and citizens taking countries or companies to court, or those justifying direct action to stop high-carbon infrastructure being built. The licence for climate action has never been stronger. There are also elements in the report that will be used by the fossil fuel industry to further delay climate action. Central to this is the discussion of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Those who bank on business-as-usual will argue that later this century we will be able to suck carbon out of the air, so why bother cutting emissions as sharply as possible today? The answer, in the report, is that carbon removal “currently faces technological, economic, institutional, ecological-environmental and sociocultural barriers”. The report rightly says that some carbon removal is needed, but it should never be an alternative to cutting emissions now. It makes clear how unrealistic very high carbon removal pathways are, in stronger terms than ever before. For those who have been working for a better climate, the full 3,000-page report contains an astonishingly frank assessment of the organised efforts used to thwart climate action, noting: “opposition to climate action by carbon-connected industries is broad-based, highly organized, and matched with extensive lobbying”. It may seem ironic that this doesn’t make it into the much more widely read summary, but it is perhaps not surprising. The intertwined relationship between fossil fuels and governments goes deep: last week, for example, we learned that the former UK boss of BP is to be appointed by the government to champion the UK’s transition to a low-carbon economy. Each year that passes adds further reasons to stop using fossil fuels. Last year, it became clear that gas prices would rise sharply, affecting millions. This year, we can add that fossil fuels fund the Russian military and its atrocities. Add these to ending urban air pollution and avoiding hundreds of millions of people suffering heatwaves, drought and floods. And the price? Investing a few per cent of GDP and some new legislation. Climate change can feel complex, but the IPCC has worked hard to make it simple for us. A path still exists to halve emissions by 2030 and get to net zero by 2050, which will probably meet the 1.5C goal. It is a hopeful message. The task now is to make it real.

4/6/2022,"The lavish wealth of Roman Abramovich’s business partners can be revealed today, including offshore investments in a Caribbean island resort, plans to redevelop a Marylebone church and a vast array of property in the UK and beyond. Documents seen by the Guardian detail the sprawling business empire controlled by the Russian billionaires Alexander Abramov and Aleksandr Frolov. The business partners hold a combined 29% stake in the Russian steel and coking coal producer Evraz, alongside Abramovich. Although not directly sanctioned, Evraz is named in the government’s sanctions against Abramovich and its shares are currently suspended. Neither Abramov nor Frolov have been the subject of sanctions in the UK, EU or US. Abramov, a steel baron who founded Evraz and oversaw its listing on the London Stock Exchange in 2005, was given an award by Vladimir Putin in 2017 for his work, the Decoration For Beneficence. He was pictured with the president and defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, at the ceremony. Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP, named Abramov in the House of Commons as one of a number of Russian billionaires who “made their money only because they are close to the Kremlin, and they sustain their wealth only because they remain close to the Kremlin.” Both men were also named on the “Putin List” of 210 prominent Russians released by the US Treasury in 2018. Abramov, Frolov and Evraz did not respond to requests for comment. Announcing sanctions on Abramovich, the government has said it believes Evraz may make steel for the Russian military, including for tanks. Evraz has denied this, saying it only supplies steel to the infrastructure and construction sectors. Jointly, Abramov and Frolov have an extraordinary portfolio, including multiple investments in the UK. Documents seen by the Guardian show that their portfolio included: West Caicos, a Caribbean island intended to be developed as a luxury resort island. Co-investment in the redevelopment of All Souls church near the BBC in Marylebone, London, to include office space. Shepherd’s Bush market, via investment in the company aiming to acquire a majority stake. Office space in London, Leicester and Glasgow. A Prague golf course community with more than homes and a hotel and spa. Land and a part-built hotel in Mykonos, alongside an operating partner. An office at one of London’s most prestigious Mayfair addresses on Clifford Street. The pair’s UK property investments alone total more £100m. They have also previously invested in historic UK pubs, including the LGBTQ venue the Black Cap in Camden. The pair helped fund the purchase of the pub in 2010, according to Transparency International, a deal that was followed by a long-running battle with campaigners over plans to redevelop it into flats. Abramov and Frolov control their global network of investments via Vollin Holdings Ltd, an entity based in the British Virgin Islands, a tax haven and financial secrecy jurisdiction. Vollin’s investments, worth more than €500m, are in turn managed by Kew Capital LLP, which was founded after Evraz was listed on FTSE and is based in Mayfair. In its sanctions notice, the government claimed that Abramovich effectively controls Evraz, and that it supplied goods and services to the Russian government that could contribute to the invasion of Ukraine. The company has denied its steel was used to build Russian tanks and said that Abramovich did not have “effective control.” However, Evraz signed a five-year deal in 2012 to supply railway wheels and “metal” to UralVagonZavod, a Russian company that is the world’s largest manufacturer of battle tanks. It makes T-72s and T-90s that are in service in Ukraine today. Since he was sanctioned by the UK government, Abramovich’s assets have been frozen, meaning he cannot sell his stake in Evraz. He bought a 41% holding for £1.6bn in 2006 from Abramov and Frolov. The size of the stake has since declined to 29% but was worth £2.5bn at the beginning of the year, before the war in Ukraine triggered the collapse of the Evraz share price. The whole board of directors has resigned and the company’s shares have been suspended from theLondon Stock Exchange since 10 March. Vollin’s assets have not been subject to any restrictions and its investments are managed by London-based Kew Capital and promoted via a wholly owned vehicle called Decimus Real Estate from offices in Mayfair. One of the most eye-catching of those assets, pictured among other projects on the Decimus website, is an island in West Caicos, which is due to be developed in partnership with a luxury real estate firm. Plans for the island include a marina village, boutique hotels, a golf course and mooring spaces for guests’ superyachts. The company’s website boasts of its involvement in developments including luxury houses in Kensington and Knightsbridge, a portfolio of prestigious London pubs, student housing in Florence, Italy and an almond farm in Portugal.",News/World news,From Marylebone to Caribbean: wealth of Abramovich’s business partners revealed,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/06/from-marylebone-to-caribbean-wealth-of-abramovich-business-partners-revealed
4/6/2022,"Secret police recordings in which a man claims to have killed Paddy Moriarty with a hammer have been heard at an inquest into the Northern Territory man’s disappearance. Moriarty, 70, and his dog went missing from the town of Larrimah, 430km south of Darwin, on 16 December 2017, with police suspecting foul play. On Wednesday, the inquest heard recordings allegedly from the Larrimah home of Owen Laurie. On one recording, a voice says: “Fucking killed Paddy, hit him on the head. Smacked him on the fucking nostrils with my claw hammer,” and “I killerated old Paddy … I struck him on the fucking head and killerated the bastard … basherated him.” Laurie, who was 70 at the time Moriarty vanished, had worked as a caretaker and gardener for Fran Hodgetts and lived on her property where she ran a teahouse. Hodgetts, who appeared at Wednesday’s inquest via video from Melbourne, had a long-running feud with the missing man and alleged he repeatedly poisoned her plants. She said when she had warned Laurie about the vandalism on her property, he told her that “if anyone touches my garden, it will be the first murder in Larrimah”. Police installed recording devices in Laurie’s home on 29 December 2017 – less than two weeks after Irish-born Moriarty and his dog disappeared. In the eight recordings played to the court on Wednesday, a man is heard singing, chatting to a dog, muttering, yodelling and strumming a guitar. After hearing the first recording – on which the voice says “Yeah, fucking idiots tell them what I’ve done, hit with a fucking hammer” – Laurie told the inquest: “I don’t think that’s me.” He then exercised his right against self-incrimination and remained silent after the playing of the subsequent seven recordings. The recordings also included the man’s voice stating: “He’s a good bloke. He’s terrible. No wonder I fucking belted him” and “I had a fight in the middle of the night”. A voice was heard saying: “I kill pup dogs” and “Well they didn’t fucking find the hammer. Well they can’t get me for anything.” Laurie denied any knowledge of what happened to Moriarty as did his former employer Hodgetts. Hodgetts was asked to comment on allegations made earlier in the inquest by Pine Creek man Wayne Ledwidge. Ledwidge claimed that in late 2017 he overheard a conversation between his friend Brian Roberts, now deceased, and Hodgetts, in which Hodgetts offered him $10,000 to “get rid” of Moriarty. Hodgetts on Wednesday denied the encounter took place. “I never ever ever ever paid anyone to bump Paddy off,” she said. “I swear on my mother and father’s grave, I don’t know him and I never said that.” Ledwidge also gave evidence that he believed Roberts may have been involved in the 2001 death of Peter Falconio, for which Bradley John Murdoch was convicted in 2005, but the court heard there was nothing to support this. The inquest first opened in 2018, six months after Moriarty’s disappearance.

4/6/2022,"Astrong renewal of the Grade One Betway Bowl is the feature event on the opening afternoon of the Grand National Festival, as two former winners – Clan Des Obeaux and Kemboy – take on the up-and-coming Protektorat, third home in the Cheltenham Gold Cup, and Conflated, the surprise winner of the Irish Gold Cup in February. Eldorado Allen, third in the Ryanair at Cheltenham, is also a serious player as Colin Tizzard looks to add to Cue Card’s win in this race six years ago. The effort required to reach the frame in a Cheltenham Grade One can often take a toll at Aintree, however, with only two of 13 runners who were placed at the Festival managing to follow up in this race since 2010. That narrows the focus towards Clan Des Obeaux (2.55) and Kemboy, both unraced since February, and Paul Nicholls’s 10-year-old, blinkered for the first time, is a fair bet at around 4-1 to extend his excellent Aintree record. The race fell apart a little last year, when several opponents under-performed and he ran out a 26-length winner. This is still very much his track and time of year, however, and a fifth career win at the highest level is within reach. Aintree 2.20 Brazil and Pied Piper head the market for Aintree’s Grade One juvenile hurdle having both run big races at the Festival, where Brazil edged out hot favourite Gaelic Warrior in the Fred Winter and Pied Piper was a close third in the Triumph. Both had tough races there, however, while Jonjo O’Neill’s Petit Tonnerre has not seen a track since his successful British debut at Market Rasen in February. The bare form there is a mile away from what will be required on Thursday, but he posted a strong time in the circumstances while also leaving plenty of room for improvement. Aintree 3.30 Zanahiyr was a length behind Epatante in the Champion Hurdle last month and the extra half-mile seems more likely to suit Gordon Elliott’s five-year-old as both horses step up to two-and-a-half miles for the first time here. Brewin’upastorm, a winner over track and trip in November, could prove to be a more troublesome opponent, but Zanahiyr is still on the upgrade and may have a touch more class than Olly Murphy’s consistent nine-year-old. Aintree 4.05 Latenightpass put up a brave performance to finish second in this race last year having already made the frame in Cheltenham’s hunter chase, and looked ideally suited by the drop back in trip at Liverpool. He made short work of his field in a point-to-point last time out and can give Gina Andrews a first success in the “amateur’s Grand National”. Aintree 4.40 A long list of potential winners in the most competitive race of the day, but again it could pay to back a fresh horse.
