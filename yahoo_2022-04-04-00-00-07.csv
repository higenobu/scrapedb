4/4/2022,"(Reuters) - The head of the Russian Orthodox Church held a service for Russian soldiers on Sunday in which he called on them to defend their country ""as only Russians can"" as Moscow continues its military campaign in Ukraine. At the lavishly decorated Main Cathedral of the Armed Forces opened two years ago in Kubinka outside Moscow, Patriarch Kirill told a group of servicemen and servicewomen that Russia was a ""peace-loving"" country that had suffered greatly from war. ""We absolutely do not strive for war or to do anything that could harm others,"" said the patriarch, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin. ""But we have been raised throughout our history to love our fatherland. And we will be ready to protect it, as only Russians can defend their country."" Kirill, 75, has previously made statements defending Moscow's actions in Ukraine and sees the war as a bulwark against a Western liberal culture that he considers decadent, particularly over the acceptance of homosexuality. His support for the military intervention, in which thousands of soldiers and Ukrainian civilians have been killed, has angered some within the Orthodox church at home as well as in churches abroad linked to the Moscow Patriarchate. At his sermon on Sunday, Patriarch Kirill said he also felt concern for the people affected by the armed conflict. ""All these are people of Holy Russia,"" he said. ""They are our brothers and sisters."" Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its neighbour's military and root out what it called dangerous nationalists. It depicts Ukraine as a potential bridgehead for the Western NATO alliance and a direct threat to Russia. Ukraine and the Western countries supporting it reject that as a baseless pretext for a war of aggression. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions in an effort to force Russia to withdraw its forces.

4/4/2022,"STORY: Ukraine on Saturday said its forces had seized back all areas around Kyiv, claiming complete control of the capital region for the first time since Russia launched the invasion. Ukraine's Deputy Defence Minister proclaimed on Facebook, “The whole Kyiv region is liberated from the invader.” There was no Russian comment on the claim, which Reuters could not immediately verify. As Russian troops regrouped for battles in the east, towns surrounding Kyiv bore scars of five weeks of fighting. In Bucha, dead bodies laid scattered in the streets. The mayor said more than 300 residents had been killed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russian forces of leaving behind mines in the north as they withdrew. “They are mining houses, mining equipment, even the bodies of people who were killed. There are a lot of trip wires, a lot of other dangers. We are moving forward, we are moving carefully, and everyone who returns to this territory must also be very careful.” Russia's defense ministry did not reply to a request for comment on the mining allegations. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a 'special military operation' to demilitarize and 'denazify' its neighbour. It has depicted its drawdown of forces near Kyiv as a goodwill gesture in peace talks. Both sides described talks held this week in Istanbul and by video link as ""difficult."" But a Ukrainian negotiator said on Saturday enough progress had been made to allow for direct talks between Zelenskiy and Russian President Vladimir Putin.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Ukraine claims control over Kyiv region,https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-claims-control-over-kyiv-042505317.html
