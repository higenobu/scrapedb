2/13/2022,"Protesters demonstrated in dozens of towns and cities across the UK on Saturday to highlight how the spiralling cost of living crisis is affecting the public. The demonstrations, co-organised by anti-austerity organisation People’s Assembly and supported by trade unions, were held in at least 25 towns and cities, from London to Glasgow to Bangor.  The protests come as UK inflation jumped to 5.4% in December, the highest rate in almost 30 years. The Bank of England warned CPI will hit 6% by April, with governor Andrew Bailey coming under fire for suggesting workers should not ask for big pay rises to control it. “Working people could not be working harder and yet life is getting so much more difficult,” said Laura Pidcock, national secretary of the People’s Assembly and a former Labour MP. She said there was “real anger” over the cost of living crisis and the government’s failure to act. “Older people will be cold in their homes, people will be struggling to feed their children, when none of this is a crisis of their making,” Pidcock said. The events follow fears rising living costs will be experienced by the UK’s poorest the hardest. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has come under pressure to rethink April’s national insurance (NI) rise, after a thinktank warned UK households classed “destitute” could climb by almost a third – to more than 1 million – this spring.

The protests were sparked because “people are fed up of rich men telling them that they have to pay for boardroom greed and colossal market failure,” said Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite.

Andy Simmons, a 24-year-old from Leeds who works in merchandising in London, attended the Parliament Square demo to protest rising living costs after his rent was recently hiked. “When I moved in I was paying £780 rent a month,” he said, for a room in a flat with three housemates. “Now I’m paying £845 – it could have even been worse, the landlord wanted to raise it to £950.” “Quality of life is progressively getting worse under a Tory government,” Simmons said. “But they can obviously afford to spend millions giving Big Ben a makeover.” Sunak insisted it was “simply not right” that the “poorest will bear the burden” of NI rises in an interview with Sky News. But opposition MPs at Saturday’s events blamed the Conservatives. “The cost of living crisis is a Tory political choice: They hand bankers a £1bn-a-year tax cut while scrapping the £20-a-week universal credit uplift,” Labour MP Zarah Sultana, who attended the Coventry demonstration, said on Twitter.

2/13/2022,"For only the second time in five gruelling months Everton felt the release of a Premier League victory. A superb first-half display and disciplined second delivered three vital points for Frank Lampard, as his new team cast off their insecurities to deliver a comprehensive beating of Leeds. Séamus Coleman, leading by example, Michael Keane and Anthony Gordon scored the goals that gave Lampard his first league win as Everton manager and firm evidence of his players’ ability to haul themselves away from relegation danger, providing this level is maintained. Marcelo Bielsa’s side were dominated throughout and, despite flashes of inspiration from Rodrigo, rarely threatened to repeat their stirring recovery at Aston Villa in midweek.  Lampard’s commitment to attack was evident for the second successive Saturday at Goodison but this was an impressive demonstration of his wider managerial skills. The new Everton manager was without seven first-team players, including two leading central defenders and the club’s only recognised left-back in Vitalii Mykolenko. He responded by abandoning his early 3-4-3 system and handing Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Donny van de Beek, Jonjoe Kenny and Alex Iwobi their first starts of his reign. All four shone in a fine collective performance. Kenny nullified Raphinha and provided an attacking threat as a makeshift left-back. The fit-again Calvert-Lewin led the line with power, aggression and a graceful touch. Van de Beek brought vision and authority to central midfield, igniting a much-improved display from Allan alongside him in the process, while the often-maligned Iwobi was a potent threat on the right wing. Bielsa’s more defensive approach, with the Leeds manager reverting to a five-man rearguard, brought the visitors little protection as Everton hunted in packs, chased lost causes and played with relentless intensity. The visitors were not helped by the early loss of Stuart Dallas to injury but Bielsa’s decision to make two further substitutions at half-time reflected the paucity of his team’s contribution. The visitors were instantly on the back foot as Gordon sparkled on the left and Iwobi drove forward on the opposite flank. Everton had five attempts at goal, with three on target, in the opening 15 minutes as they fed off a vibrant Goodison crowd and sought to atone for Tuesday’s damaging defeat at Newcastle. Gordon had a great chance to open the scoring after merely 65 seconds when Allan seized on a poor clearance out of the Leeds defence and Calvert-Lewin released the young winger inside the area. Luke Ayling just did enough to take the sting out of Gordon’s shot with only Illan Meslier to beat. The home side remained on the front foot and a flowing move involving Coleman, Gordon and Van de Beek brought a merited early lead. The Netherlands midfielder swept an inviting cross along the face of Meslier’s goal towards Calvert-Lewin and, though Pascal Struijk did well to deny the centre-forward a certain tap-in, his challenge sent the ball looping towards the far post. Having continued his run into the area and reacted quicker than Mateusz Klich, Coleman converted with a diving header. Everton’s second epitomised their considerable effort. Richarlison won a corner out of nothing when charging down Robin Koch near the byline. Gordon curled a delightful set-piece to the far post where Keane emerged from a well-worked routine to thump an unstoppable header beyond the Leeds goalkeeper. Despite being second best in every department and frequently over-run, Leeds had chances to prey on Everton’s brittle confidence with Rodrigo twice smacking the crossbar from distance. Mason Holgate executed a vital, clean challenge on Daniel James after Rodrigo had released the Wales international through on goal. Seconds later, finding himself in space 25 yards from goal, Rodrigo beat Jordan Pickford with a dipping half volley only for the woodwork to intervene. He was denied for a second time in first-half stoppage time when curling towards the top corner from 20 yards, with the same end result. Bielsa’s changes injected the necessary improvement from Leeds in the second half without seriously threatening to spoil Pickford’s clean sheet. A bottle thrown from the away end towards Coleman, thankfully missing its intended target, was another sour note on Leeds’ afternoon. Everton wrapped up victory late on. Receiving Allan’s pass on the right, Richarlison turned inside Koch and with the Leeds’ defence in retreat drove a low shot in from 20 yards out, which went in via a deflection off Gordon. It was a fitting end to a convincing display from an unrecognisable Everton team. Salomón Rondón was close to making it four from Dele Alli’s immaculate cross in the 90th minute but Meslier produced a magnificent save to tip away the substitute’s volley.",Sport/Football,Michael Keane helps sink Leeds to give Frank Lampard first Everton league win,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/12/everton-leeds-premier-league-match-report
2/13/2022,"Returning to their birthplace after decades of enforced exile, five Chagossians leapt from a motor launch on to the palm-shaded beach of Peros Banhos atoll on Saturday afternoon, kissed the sand and stood – hands joined together – in prayer. For Olivier Bancoult, Lisbey Elyse, Marie Suzelle Baptiste, Rosemonde Bertin and Marcel Humbert, it was the moment they had long anticipated – the first time they could step ashore without close close monitoring by British officials. It is 50 years since they were forcibly deported to Mauritius by the UK, which cleared the archipelago of its entire population to make way for a US military base on the island of Diego Garcia.  All five wore T-shirts with the motto: “Chagos My Home” and “Everyone has a right to live in his birthplace” . “We are not coming as tourists,” said Bancoult, “we are coming as pilgrims to pay tribute to this abandoned place. “The importance of this trip is that we can send a message to the world – about the kind of injustice the UK government, with the help of the US government, inflicted on our people. If we were white people with blue eyes, maybe we would have had better treatment?” This is the first visit organised by the Mauritian government, which is determined to regain control of the Chagos archipelago. International court rulings and a majority vote in the UN general assembly have confirmed that the UK “unlawfully” detached the islands from Mauritius before independence and must return them. The UK insists that it retains sovereignty and that the landmark ruling at the International Court of Justice in 2019 was only advisory. On Saturday, the Chagossians’ first task was to move a monument, recording a return visit under British supervision in 2006, further up the beach to avoid erosion from encroaching waves. In the sultry heat, they manoeuvred the heavy stone with sticks. The island’s jetty, which once received commercial ships, has disintegrated; its railroad track, that carried goods to the island’s shop and transported copra oil, has rusted away. Even in this remote site, plastic water bottles littered the tideline and there was glass on the beach. A sign placed beside a concrete box declared: “This is a BIOT (British Indian Ocean Territory) fire pit.” While native Chagossians are denied permission to return permanently, BIOT officials grant licences for yachts to visit their deserted homes. Moving inland, trees have grown over homes and warehouses have fallen into decay since the island was evacuated in 1972. The ground is littered with rotting coconut shells. Hermit crabs swarm across the floor and the occasional giant robber crab – capable of splitting coconuts in two with their claws – appeared in the undergrowth. What was, in the 1960s, the administrator’s bleached white house in a broad clearing is derelict and overshadowed by palms. A giant banyan tree has taken root in the stone steps to the first floor, its roots gripping the stone. A vast water tank stands rusting beside the building. Nearby is the chapel of Saint Sacrement, the island’s chapel. “This is where I was christened,” said Bancoult. The roof had collapsed, the walls were covered in yellow and ochre mould. With his fellow Chagossians, he set to work clearing the floor. Sprouting coconuts were hurled out through the empty windows. Humbert hacked at palm fronds with a machete, trying to push back the jungle from their former existence. “I was baptised here, too,” said Elyse. “This is my church.” Bancoult added: “My grandfather had his funeral here in 1969. My mother made her first communion here. Can’t I have the right to live in my birthplace? It’s racism. They should give everyone in overseas territories the same treatment.” As the ship approached Peros Banhos on Friday evening, the prime minister of Mauritius, Pravind Jugnauth, told the Observer by phone that his country’s first expedition to the Chagos Islands was “not in any way a hostile act” and not meant to embarrass the UK. “It is merely an exercise of our sovereignty over part of our territory and that is in accordance with international law.” He said: “The UK has acted in violation of human rights and international law when it forcibly removed the Chagossians. Uprooting people from their place of birth and where they were living without any warning and putting them on a ship and just leaving them at the quay in Mauritius. And preventing them going back … That’s clearly a crime against humanity and it’s extraordinary serious.” The Foreign Office said: “Successive UK governments have expressed sincere regret about the manner in which Chagossians were removed from BIOT in the late 1960s and early 1970s … and we are currently delivering a £40m support package to Chagossians over a 10-year period.”",News/World news,Exiled Chagos Islanders bask in return ‘as pilgrims to abandoned place’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/12/exiled-chagos-islanders-return-uk-disputed-archipelago-mauritius
2/13/2022,"A match that started with the stands reverberating to cheers as Roy Hodgson was introduced as Watford’s latest manager ended in front of empty seats and with a sixth successive home defeat. Not since 20 November have they won at Vicarage Road, the same day Brighton suffered their last and indeed only away defeat in the league. Neither run looked likely to end once Neal Maupay had put the visitors in front shortly before the break.  Watford’s new manager bounce, such as it was, lasted about 15 minutes, came at the start of the second half with the side already a goal down and had long since fallen flat by the time Adam Webster ended the contest in the 82nd minute. Watford have been in the habit of starting games particularly badly – as their league position suggests they have not been ending them very well either, and it is probably best not to mention the middle period – but here their initial inferiority seemed almost by design. As at West Ham in midweek Hodgson picked four specialist central midfielders at the expense of effective width, a defensive set-up perhaps calculated to frustrate their opponents until such time that Ismaila Sarr, who returned from the African Cup of Nations only on Friday, could be risked off the bench and release the shackles. It never convincingly did so, and despite the crowd of central players Adam Lallana seemed able to find pockets of space in the middle and because of it Brighton’s two wing-backs enjoyed plenty of it in wide areas. Danny Welbeck started on his return to the club he represented with little success two seasons ago, playing slightly ahead of Neal Maupay in attack, and the former Arsenal forward’s movement, sucking defenders towards the goal, at least partially explains the amount of space Maupay enjoyed when picked out by Tariq Lamptey’s cross shortly before half-time. He did not seem to strike his half-volley cleanly, but that only helped the ball to spin and dip perfectly into the far corner. Ben Foster had by then saved from both Maupay and Jakub Moder, Pascal Gross had sent a free header wide from Moder’s cross, and at the interval Brighton had enjoyed 72% of possession and all three shots on target. Watford took quarter of an hour to provide any kind of threat but the most significant action Robert Sanchez had been forced into was watching Josh King’s half-volley, after Kiko Femenia’s corner dropped to him in space, sail well over the bar. Having picked a team apparently designed to cede control, Hodgson now had to establish a way to prise it back again. The arrival at the interval of Sarr and Imran Louza had an instant, positive effect. Within two minutes Louza had lifted the ball down the right for Sarr to run onto, cut inside and discomfort the Brighton defence, if not in the end their goalkeeper. In the following minutes Louza beat two men with a drop of the shoulder, Sarr prodded the ball through a defender’s legs and Watford looked, if not genuinely convincing, at least quite fun. This period culminated in the 63rd minute when the ball dropped to Emmanuel Dennis outside the left-hand corner of the penalty area and he brought it down, beat three men, burst into the box, cut inside Lewis Dunk and lashed a shot into the meat of the crossbar. Within a minute Potter had made two changes of his own, and with the arrivals of Yves Bissouma and Alexis Mac Allister the game swung again. Watford’s momentum leaked from them long before, at the end of the finest move of the half, Joel Veltman crossed and Moder’s half-volley was deflected wide. From the resulting corner the ball dropped to Webster, rebounded back to him off Femenia, and was emphatically shinned in from three yards.",Sport/Football,Neal Maupay stunner inspires Brighton to victory against struggling Watford,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/12/watford-brighton-premier-league-match-report
2/13/2022,"Russian spokespeople daily deny any intention to invade. So, too, did Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, when he met the French leader, Emmanuel Macron, last week, and when he spoke to US president Joe Biden on the phone. There are two problems with this. First, given Putin’s Johnsonian relationship with truth, few western governments believe the denials. Second, Putin has not explained why, if his intentions are peaceful, more than half of Russia’s armed forces, including 130,000 troops, are massed on Ukraine’s borders. It could all be a bluff. But who would bet the house on that?  There are numerous theories. Putin is said to want to rebuild a Russian sphere of influence in eastern Europe, principally embracing former Soviet republics such as now independent Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, Georgia and Ukraine. He has frequently bemoaned their “loss” after the Soviet Union collapsed. Putin may also hope to demonstrate to the west (and Russians) that the country is still a superpower, even though by most measures (nuclear weapon stockpiles and geography apart) it is a failing medium-sized power. Putin fears strategically important Ukraine, commanding Russia’s south-western flank, is assimilating into the west. He objects to its growing closeness to Nato. He also opposes Kyiv’s developing links with the EU. Worse still, from his point of view, Ukraine is a democracy, with free speech and free media, which freely elects its leaders. In practice, Russians enjoy no such freedoms – if they followed Ukraine’s example, Putin would not last long. More broadly, Putin is a nostalgic revisionist who regards Ukraine as an integral part of historical Russia and its loss as a symbol of Russia’s cold war defeat. Putin may sense western weakness. Nato was humiliated last year in Afghanistan and Joe Biden, who campaigned to end wars, not engage in new ones, has refocused American foreign policy and military resources on China, not Europe. It’s also suggested Putin needs a big victory to shore up his domestic support, vindicate his anti-western policies, excuse rampant regime corruption and kleptomania, and justify the hardships Russians endure as a result of western sanctions imposed after his first attack on Ukraine, in 2014. That was when he annexed Crimea and took de facto control of the eastern Donbas region. To end the standoff (maybe), Putin wants Nato to promise never to accept Ukraine (or Georgia and Moldova) as members. He wants the alliance to pull back from “frontline” countries such as Poland, Romania and Bulgaria, former members of the defunct Warsaw Pact. He wants Kyiv to accept autonomous status for the Donbas region and relinquish its claim to Crimea (as part of the so-called Minsk accords). He wants to limit or halt deployments in eastern and southern Europe of new US medium-range missiles. More ambitious still, he wants to redesign Europe’s “security architecture”, to re-establish Russia’s influence and extend its geopolitical reach. To most of this, the US says “no”. Hence the current crisis.",News/World news,"The edge of war: what, exactly, does Putin want in Ukraine?",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/12/russia-ukraine-what-does-putin-want
2/13/2022,"This was a meeting of two sides who look like they are fearing the worst. Yet while both Thomas Frank and Patrick Vieira will not complain about picking up another point towards their survival fund, neither could be left satisfied after a scrappy encounter that failed to ever really get started.  For Brentford, there was at least the encouragement of ending a worrying sequence of defeats that moves them seven points clear of Norwich in 18th spot, not to mention seeing Christian Eriksen given a hero’s welcome at his new home. An emotional appearance on the pitch from the Denmark midfielder – billed by his new manager as potentially Brentford’s “greatest signing ever” – before kick-off proved to be the highlight of the afternoon. The 29-year-old is expected to take part in a friendly on Monday as he begins his comeback, although Frank has said he will not be rushed back after suffering a cardiac arrest on the pitch at Euro 2020. A player with such top-level experience would be a welcome addition to any squad but for a team that had lost its previous six matches in all competitions before this, Eriksen’s arrival could yet prove to be crucial. After the blistering start to their first topflight campaign since 1947, Brentford have picked up just eight points since beating Everton here at the end of November and are looking somewhat shaky. Frank made three changes to the team that lost at Manchester City in midweek, with Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo selected to lead the line in the absence of injured top scorer Ivan Toney. Vieira also mixed up his forward line by bringing in Jordan Ayew for his first start since 1 January and Odsonne Édouard. Palace’s draw against Norwich in midweek meant they started this match in 13th position – the same as at this stage last season under Roy Hodgson –but with three points fewer. Vieira will have been encouraged to see his side make a better start than conceding inside the opening 40 seconds like at Carrow Road, although they could not create an early test for David Raya in the Brentford goal. In fact, it wasn’t until the 25th minute that either goalkeeper had a save of significance to make. Vicente Guaita was at his best to deny Mbeumo following a delightful through ball from Sergi Canós before a last-ditch tackle from Joel Ward rescued Palace again. They should have gone ahead soon after when Ayew suddenly found himself bearing down on goal but his shot went embarrassingly wide having taken an age to let fly. Vieira switched things around at half-time and pushed Wilfried Zaha up front to offer a more direct problem to the Brentford defence. But it failed to produce the required impact as the visitors continued to struggle to create any meaningful openings in a scrappy start to the second half. On the hour mark, Frank turned to Jay Dasilva in an attempt to rouse his side into action. The midfielder made his first appearance for almost a year against City and should also provide Brentford with an extra boost as the campaign reaches its climax. Palace supporters will also be delighted to see James McArthur’s return from injury after three months out and the Scotsman could at least claim to have registered a shot on target, albeit one that was comfortably gathered by Raya. Guaita had to work harder to reach a goalbound header from Pontus Jansson with 15 minutes remaining and the Spaniard did well to divert it away to safety. In the end, it was another Denmark international who almost stole the show with the last kick of the match but Joachim Anderson’s shot was watched all the way by Raya.",Sport/Football,Brentford held by Crystal Palace after welcoming Christian Eriksen,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/12/brentford-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report
2/13/2022,"Limelight: Siege (Radio 4) | BBC SoundsArchive on 4: Wonderlands (Radio 4) | BBC SoundsBacklisted | backlisted.fmHeadwaters (Radio 4) | BBC SoundsAbsolute Radio Natalie (Bauer Media) | planetradio.co.uk Well, shake up my prejudices and slap on my headphones, there was such a great drama series on Radio 4 last week. Modern, real, exciting; great acting, careful sound design, gripping plot. I know! No surprise, though, when you see the writers. Siege is co-written by Katherine Jakeways, who gave us the station’s meet-cute-then-what series Where This Service Will…; Darragh Mortell, who wrote the Prix Europa-winning I Am Kanye West, also for Radio 4; and Eno Mfon, whose one-woman stage play about skin bleaching, Check the Label, was turned into a Channel 4 short. Their considerable forces created a five x 30-minute thriller, produced by BBC Cymru Wales, that zoomed straight on to my best of the year list. Bet you it’s still there in 10 months’ time too.  The plot is essentially a remix of the 1973 Norrmalmstorg bank robbery and hostage-taking crisis in Sweden that gave the world the concept of Stockholm syndrome. Siege moves the action to a contemporary London mini-market, where five very different people are doing a lunchtime shop when an armed robber strikes. From there, the drama doesn’t cleave too closely to the real event, but there are certain elements that chime: surprised hostages, rolling TV coverage, money demands, the hint of a gas attack. Oh, and sympathy for the bad guy. That sympathy isn’t just from the hostages either; as the tension mounts, we too start to feel for the captor’s plight. It’s not the hostage-taker that we hear from, however, but the six people captured (the shoppers and a security guard). From the start, their characters shine; just the way they speak makes them realistic. You’re gripped by them, during the twists and turns, the jokes (there’s a great one about paper bags), the arresting imagery… right up to the end, which doesn’t do what you expect. Siege is a character study, a state-of-the-nation commentary and a white-knuckle edge of your seater, all in one. It’s part of Radio 4’s newish Limelight podcast strand, which has certainly pepped up the station’s drama, so hooray to the commissioners for that. Great writing is, of course, where all drama begins, and the writer Frank Cottrell-Boyce made a case for children’s books in Wonderlands, last Saturday’s Archive on 4. His contentions – that children’s books are as good, if not better than many adult novels, and that Britain is a world leader at writing for kids – were strongly made, and there were some lovely moments. Publisher Barry Cunningham started his career dressed up as a puffin, for the Puffin Club, from the children’s book imprint: “Actually, it’s a remarkably intimate activity,” he said. “Children tend to tell you their secrets.” While we’re on book tips, Cottrell-Boyce has been a guest on Backlisted, the immensely popular podcast that discusses old books. I haven’t listened for a while, but revisited, to check how it’s doing. Fine, is the answer: hosts John Mitchinson and Andy Miller are as jovial and clever as ever, the conversation informed and flowing. Cottrell-Boyce (yes, I’m a FCB fan: listen to his Desert Island Discs to become one, too) was part of a moving discussion of E Nesbit’s The Railway Children. The other guest was Katherine Rundell, author of Rooftoppers, another children’s book that wipes the floor with most adult novels. She was moved to tears, more than once, during the chat. That’s what great writing can do. The BBC has always revered writing (over, say, art or music), and Radio 4 has long been peppered with literary programmes. A glance at last week’s schedule gives us Bookclub, A Good Read, Poetry Please, Lemn Sissay’s Poetry Rebels, as well as the actual reading-out-loud of books at 9.45am and midday every day. More literature, too, in Headwaters, a one-off R4 programme about stream-of-consciousness writing, hosted by Rebecca Watson, author of the everything-in-one-day novel Little Scratch. Nice use of music and some excellent archive material, including Virginia Woolf, TS Eliot and James Joyce, made this an easy listen. While we’re on books, BBC Arts has a chatty new book offering, Turn Up for the Books, with some good guests such as Skin and the Rev Richard Coles. But the show isn’t quite there yet. Hosts Irenosen Okojie, Dan Smith and Simon Savidge need to perk up their presentation a little and be more specific in their opinions. At the moment, there are too many platitudes for this show to be useful. Enough bookery. Let’s talk straightforward radio, shall we? A few days ago, Absolute brought a brilliant idea to reality: Absolute Radio Natalie, where they gave an Absolute listener, Natalie Cole, her own station for a day. What a sweet concept, and Natalie was an excellent choice. Obsessed by singalong tunes, helped by the regular presenters, she proved a radio natural, especially great with guest Liam Gallagher: “I kind of want to have a swear-off.” There are some interesting radio ideas out there at the moment. Ex-talkRadio host Iain Lee has a phone-in show on Radio Anywhere, an online station he’s started; and Shaun Keaveny, previously of 6 Music, has booted up his own, one-day-a-week station too, Community Garden Radio.

2/13/2022,"North Sea oil producers are ripe for a windfall tax. Without moving a muscle, they have benefited from a doubling in the oil price and a quintupling of the gas price over little more than a year. There are big names in the frame, like BP and Shell, and some minnows that are now making hundreds of millions of pounds from wells offloaded a few years ago by these two lumbering giants of the industry.  If a law could be passed without too much fuss, the trading mega-companies registered in the UK or listed on the London Stock Exchange – Glencore, Trafigura and Vitol among them – would pay a slice of their multimillion-pound profits from rocketing international energy prices. A separate windfall tax on the profits from BP and Shell’s global operations – expected to be almost £40bn between them this year – could supplement the small sums they would pay for their part digging up the North Sea. It is clear from recent polling that the public likes the idea of taxing the energy industry’s lottery win. And knowing it is working with the grain of public opinion, Labour has rightly highlighted comments by BP boss Bernard Looney that his company is “a cash machine”. So far the industry fightback has secured only a handful of supporters, though critically Rishi Sunak is among them. The chancellor has made plain his opposition, citing the well-worn excuses of an industry that, just like the banking sector in the 00s, says higher taxes will prevent future investment. The most recent example was George Osborne’s North Sea tax in 2012, which was followed by a decline in drilling. Osborne’s levy was wrongly dubbed a windfall tax – it was not a one-off, but a permanent increase to the toll on profits above the usual corporation tax rate. In 2015, by which time the price of oil had collapsed, Osborne began backpedalling. In 2016, with panic in his eyes, he offered the industry climate-crisis-defying tax breaks on new exploration. Company filings revealed by the Observer last year show that between 2018 and 2020, Shell and BP, which together produce more than 1.7bn tonnes of greenhouse gases a year, avoided paying any corporation tax on oil and gas production in the North Sea. In this context, a one-year windfall tax might disturb oil and gas industry shareholders, but is unlikely to alter the investment outlook of drilling companies that judged how much to spend long before the market went into overdrive. Sunak worries a deal struck with North Sea companies to reduce the carbon footprint of their operations will be in jeopardy. So they might demand a longer timescale? Well, they might. But the Treasury’s response should be the same: tough. Then there are the Conservative MPs who believe it is un-Tory to consider taxing businesses this way. Yet in 1981, Geoffrey Howe came knocking on the doors of UK banks, asking them to accept a share of the pain felt by everyone else during the worst recession since the second world war. Howe imposed a levy that creamed off 2.5% of the banks’ non-interest-bearing current account deposits, harvesting £400m, which was about a fifth of their profits. A year later, in a move that should be given more prominence in the current debate, Margaret Thatcher’s government announced a special tax on North Sea oil and gas, which raised £2.4bn, or about £9bn in today’s money. Amid rising unemployment and falling living standards, and concerned about her re-election, Thatcher found widespread public support. Living standards are about to be hit again, though this time by the longest period (13 years) of decline in two centuries. It should be the case that windfall taxes are more common, not less. Property is a particular example of a windfall that is unearned and unjustified. It is widely acknowledged that house prices have constantly outstripped general inflation since the 1980s when Britain became reliant on private housebuilders to construct 90% of homes. Property has become the world’s biggest investment, sidelining stock markets by soaking up 80% of all investment cash globally, in large part due to the absence of any meaningful tax on rising values. Like the energy companies, all homeowners should be prepared to give up some of their lottery win, especially when the rising cost of health and pensions over the longer term will impoverish the government without extra funds from somewhere. Labour is sticking to a simple tax on oil and gas extractors in the North Sea that will only raise £1.2bn when – and Sunak should be mindful of this – a broader windfall tax is more than justified. Ed Miliband and Rachel Reeves are fronting Labour’s campaign. Maybe, as Covid and Partygate give way to the cost of living crisis as the nation’s most pressing problem, it is time for Keir Starmer to add his voice.",News/Business,What could be fairer than a tax on oil and gas’s North Sea winnings,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/12/what-could-be-fairer-than-a-tax-on-oil-and-gas-north-sea-winnings
2/13/2022,"Last week’s We Are Bristol History Commission report into the toppling of Edward Colston’s statue made fascinating reading, not least because it put a credible number on the strength of feeling on either side of the most heated “culture war” – among those who wanted the statue toppled and those outraged by the act. Nearly 14,000 people, more than half from Bristol, responded to the commission’s invitation to complete a detailed survey on their feelings about the events of June 2020. Three-quarters agreed with the idea that the slave trader’s statue should remain on permanent display in a Bristol museum, while only 12% thought it should be restored to its plinth. Those who believed it should be seen horizontally and graffitied, in the state it was recovered from the harbour, outnumbered those who believed it should be cleaned and upstanding by five to one.  Some of the best reactions, however, came from those respondents who offered compromise solutions, novel ways of keeping both statue-dunkers and pearl-clutchers happy. One of these suggested that the statue be split in two, “with one half of it returned to the plinth and the other half thrown back in the river”. Best of all, perhaps, was the proposition that “(after updating the plinth with an accurate plaque) we put Colston back up. Then once every year on the anniversary of his toppling we have a festival where we pull him down again and ceremonially throw him in the river.” What’s not to like? In 1980, Stephen Hawking was confident that a “final unified theory” of “life, the universe and everything” would be found in the next two decades. At a conference that year he assembled the theoretical physicists who seemed closest to establishing the idea of “supersymmetry”, linking the very smallest particles in the universe with the very largest forces. A blackboard from that conference, which preserves the doodlings of some of the world’s greatest minds, went on display last week in a new Hawking exhibit at the Science Museum in London. That it contains not killer equations but a series of crap in-jokes about the participants at the conference confirms my own unified theory: that Douglas Adams’s Hitchhiker books had nearly as much to say about our ultimate place in the cosmos as those of his more illustrious contemporary. Having started and abandoned a doomed series of “must get fit” regimes – couch to 5k and quickly back to couch – I thought I had stumbled on an inspired solution to my horribly sedentary work habits a month or two ago. My plan was this: every time I felt I was losing concentration in staring at my working-from-home screen – about every 17 minutes – I’d activate a favourite (alarmingly 1980s) playlist and dance around the kitchen island like nobody was watching for a couple of tracks, before returning to my desk. The tactic seemed, and still seems, so promising on several levels – quick burst of endorphins, no Lycra or Peloton required, embarrassing only to immediate family – that I believed I might have discovered a unique health breakthrough. Inevitably, however, there’s a book that shows I’m far from a pioneer. Dr Peter Lovatt’s The Dance Cure promises to provide “the surprising secret to being smarter, stronger, happier”. He assembles all sorts of disciples – from Captain Cook to Virginia Woolf to Debbie Harry – to evangelise versions of my intermittent boogie wonderland. “Let us read and let us dance,” Voltaire insisted. “These two amusements will never do any harm to the world!”  Tim Adams in an Observer columnist",Opinion/Opinion,Why not re-erect the statue of Edward Colston and topple it once a year? | Tim Adams,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/12/why-not-reerect-statue-edward-colston-and-topple-once-a-year
2/13/2022,"So Wales not quite as bad as we thought; Scotland still not nearly as consistent as they would like. After opening weekends of contrasting fortunes the two played out a thriller, the sort of edgy, imperfect, dramatic event on which this championship prides itself. On his 100th cap, Dan Biggar stepped up – insofar as his injured knee would allow – to land a drop goal with 10 minutes to go. He did with his opposite number, Finn Russell, every bit as much as a talisman for Scotland as Biggar is for Wales, in the sin bin, after a knock-on that was judged to be deliberate. Scotland, having played most of the match with their usual combination of brio and class, fell away sharply thereafter. The final 10 minutes saw them haunted and error-prone, while Wales grew all the larger.  Alas, there had to be a loser. Scotland feel those familiar pangs, seemingly all the more familiar after the giddy heights of victory. But regardless of the highs and lows of individual fortunes, this was a testament to the competitive vigour of this ancient event. The bookies had rated the match closer than the feeling at large seemed to. Form-wise there ought to have been only one team in it – and it was not the team in red, so used to prevailing here over the one in blue. Scotland won on their last visit to Wales, but that was in an empty stadium in Llanelli on account of the virus. In Cardiff, though, Wales tend to play like a different beast, whatever the personnel. Hence that ranking for Scotland of only narrow favourites. The virus had not quite finished with proceedings, insisting that the roof remain open for cleaner air, which meant an influential role given the rain in it. That might have suited Scotland still further, with their muscular pack and efficient lineout, but if the opening passage was anything to go by neither side was fazed by the elements. Matt Fagerson and Stuart McInally sparked an early period of attack for Scotland. Deep in Wales’s 22, Liam Williams managed to pilfer the ball and away Wales went, Owen Watkin dummying his way deep into Scottish territory. Stuart Hogg was quite lucky not to be penalised for a deliberate knock-on, but from the scrum Wales were awarded anyway and Biggar opened the scoring with a penalty in the fifth minute. It seemed this young Wales team might not be such a pushover after all, all the more so when Biggar landed a second penalty a few minutes later. But Scotland’s class these days is not so fragile. They responded with the game’s first try with one winger, Duhan van der Merwe, breaking down the left and the other, 18 phases later, scoring down the right. Russell’s cut-pass to Darcy Graham was sublime, and Graham’s finish brilliant past a much bigger man. Russell missed the conversion, but two penalties from his boot moved Scotland five points clear at the end of the first quarter. One of Wales’s more capped players is Tomas Francis. The tighthead anchored a scrum that more than held its own, and then built his part up further with a rare try. A brilliant 50-22 kick from another player of much experience, Liam Williams set up Wales for a spell in Scotland’s 22. When Biggar sent a penalty to the corner during it, Francis rolled off the side of the driven lineout to bring Wales level at half-time. Just before that, Scotland had lost Fagerson to injury to further disrupt a back row that had lost Jamie Ritchie the week before. Wales, too, had their disruptions with the experienced trio of Wyn Jones, Biggar and Williams requiring treatment throughout. Russell and Biggar exchanged penalties in the third quarter to maintain the tension, before the game broke open as the last 10 minutes approached. A long-range penalty by Biggar hit the bar and bounced back into the arms of Alex Cuthbert. Wales hammered away in the Scotland 22 until Russell knocked the ball on as Wales whipped it across him. Cuthbert gathered and was away to the corner for what looked like a try. Closer inspection revealed a foot in touch, which meant closer inspection for Russell’s earlier intervention. If Hogg’s knock-on in the first half had been deemed all right, it is difficult to see why this one was not. Russell looked as if he could have caught it, but such attempts are always gambles in your own 22. This one was not the first of Russell’s to back fire. He saw yellow, and Wales set up camp in the corner. Two line-outs followed, and Biggar assumed position.

2/13/2022,"Saskia Aukema knew little about her great-aunt Annie, who was murdered during the Holocaust. All she knew was that Annie had declined to go into hiding like her siblings, and continued working as a hospital nurse, even after the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands began in May 1940. “That was the family story: this was the woman who didn’t hide and chose to be with her patients. That was all I knew… this line, this one sentence,” she told the Observer.  When Aukema, a photographer and editor, was told by her father a few years ago that Annie had married in Westerbork, the Nazi transit camp in the north Netherlands, she was stunned. Westerbork was the last staging post for nearly 107,000 Dutch Jews before they were put on trains to Auschwitz, Bergen-Belsen and other Nazi camps in central and eastern Europe. Only 5,000 returned. Aukema was left wondering: “How is it possible that you can marry in such a grim place as a transit camp?” Unsatisfied with an internet search, she began to explore the archives and found dozens of Westerbork weddings. Between 4 September 1940 and 17 September 1944, 261 couples married there. Some of their stories are told in Aukema’s book, Until Death Do Us Part, which was published in Dutch last month. “First I wanted to honour the couples,” Aukema said. She also hopes to help people feel the enormity of the loss and suffering of the Holocaust, in a more personal way than the formal ceremonies of Remembrance Day. “I thought I could touch a new generation, people who had perhaps forgotten about the history, or hadn’t forgotten but don’t feel it every day, so they could feel it again.” The camp authorities, under SS commander Albert Konrad Gemmeker, allowed marriages as well as entertainment such as theatre and sport because they added to the illusion that the worst could be avoided. “Westerbork was a ‘make-believe’ world, the Nazis and especially Gemmeker created an illusion,” Gerdien Verschoor, director of the Camp Westerbork Memorial Centre told the Observer. “Marriages were allowed and facilitated, so as not to arouse suspicion. To keep people calm and to give them something to look forward to.” Before the Nazi occupation, Westerbork was a refugee camp for German Jews, so it had facilities, such as schools, kindergartens and a hospital. “The camp had to look as normal as possible,” Verschoor said. The commander, Gemmeker “wanted to create the illusion of normal village life,” she added. “And I think he succeeded very well. People didn’t believe and couldn’t believe that they could be sent to extermination camps; they didn’t have any idea about what was happening in Auschwitz, they really thought they were going to work, and it was very important for Gemmeker to keep that illusion to the end.” As part of this make-believe world, men, women and children were treated in the Westerbork hospital to make them fit enough to be sent to the death camps; couples were allowed to marry and dream of a future. Not all marriages were love matches. The “right” marriage was thought to offer some protection, from being sent east. “People, especially women who married a man with a job in the camp, thought they were not going to be deported,” Verschoor said. Staff at the memorial centre knew about the marriages, but the book brought home the jarring contrast between the hopes of the people in photos that survive and the harrowing reality. “If you don’t see the stars [that Jews were obliged to wear], you see happy couples, and that is what is so upsetting,” Verschoor said. Most of the Westerbork weddings were civil ceremonies. Some were Jewish religious ceremonies that took place in the “synagogue barracks”, which was also the venue for bar mitzvahs. Brides wore white veils and flowers in their hair. There was one white wedding dress shared among several women. And there were wedding “meals” – some extra vegetables, a potato saved up from rations for the celebration. Residents sent homemade cards to the newlyweds: “congratulations from the residents of barracks 42-3”. Kaatje de Wijze married Leo Emile Kok on 13 September 1943. Leo was a talented artist, who was friends with Rudolf Breslauer, a German Jewish photographer, who arrived in Westerbork after fleeing Nazi persecution. As a gift to the couple, Breslauer photographed them on their wedding day. Few traces survive of the wedding of Aukema’s great-aunt. Annie Preger married Hans van Witsen on 28 January 1943. They had met a few months earlier at the Apeldoornsche Bosch, a Jewish psychiatric hospital, where Annie was a nurse and Hans was a gardener. It must have been love at first sight. Within two months, they were engaged. But the hospital was no longer the safe haven from Nazi persecution many had hoped. Like many staff, Annie and Hans were sent to Westerbork. They married soon after arriving, in a ceremony witnessed by two colleagues in the hospital. Soon after, Annie went to the camp hospital, where she was treated for a stomach complaint. Hans missed his new bride, describing himself as a widower, because they were separated so soon. When she was discharged, he wrote to his father: “I am mesjogge [crazy] with happiness.” The couple hoped Annie could get a job at the hospital. But it never happened. They were selected for “labour deployment” and sent on a train to Sobibor extermination camp in German-occupied Poland. From the train, they succeeded in throwing out some letters: they had “good places” in the carriage and were well, Hans wrote to his father. “We will see you very soon.” Annie and Hans were murdered soon after arriving. They had been married for 36 days. Kaatje de Wijze and Leo Emiel Kok did not escape the transports either. Although Gemmeker, an enthusiast for art, theatre and beautiful women, admired Kok’s drawings, it was not enough to save them. Every week the camp had to meet quotas to put Jews on eastbound trains, to be murdered or sent into forced labour. Kaatje and Leo were on the last train to Theresienstadt in September 1944. At that camp they were separated and Leo was sent to Auschwitz. Kaatje broke through a cordon to say goodbye; they vowed to reunite. Leo was later sent to the Ebensee concentration camp, where he did hard labour in the freezing cold, ruining his health. He died days after the liberation aged 22. Kaatje de Wijze survived the war and lived until 2018. Their marriage had lasted 607 days. Many marriages were very short. Some lasted just four days, meaning the couple were transported east on their wedding day and murdered on arrival. Maurits van Thijn, who survived the war, with his wife Catharina Blitz, joked bleakly they had been sent on “honeymoon to Auschwitz”, because they had been deported on their wedding day. After the war, Westerbork was an internment camp for Dutch collaborators, (briefly) a military barracks and later refashioned as housing for immigrants from the Moluccas, an Indonesian former Dutch colony known as the Spice Islands. The final barracks were demolished in 1971 and a memorial centre opened in 1983. There is almost nothing left of the original camp. To research her book, Aukema visited several times, and photographed the countryside, experiencing the scorching summer heat and mosquitos, and the biting winter cold. “It’s so strange that things like that happened in such a beautiful place,” she said. “You have to make a lot of effort to see it.”",News/World news,Love in a time of terror: the tragic couples who married at a Dutch Nazi transit camp,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/12/dutch-nazi-transit-camp-couples-who-married
2/13/2022,"Election supervisors in Texas have warned that new stricter voter ID requirements ahead of next month’s state governor’s primary have already resulted in an uncharacteristically high number of ballot rejections. Voting rights activists have expressed fears that new laws making access to the vote more difficult – that have been passed in many states across the US by Republicans – will impact Democrat-leaning voters of color.  According to officials in media reports, as many as 40% of roughly 3,600 returned ballots in Harris county, Texas’ most populous county that incorporates Houston, have lacked the identification number required under Senate Bill 1, a Republican-sponsored bill designed to tie voters to valid IDs. In Williamson county, a northern suburb of Austin with a fast-growing population of non-white residents, the rejection rate has been about 25% of early mail-in votes ahead of the 1 March primary which will determine which of the five Democratic challengers, including former US congressman Beto O’Rourke, will likely take on the Republican governor, Greg Abbott. Many of the rejected ballots, election officials said, fail a new requirement to provide an identification number inside the return envelope. Election officials in Harris county alone have said 1,360, or 40%, of mail-in ballots were sent back to voters as of Wednesday because they lacked an ID number. “We’ll see how many we get back,” Isabel Longoria, the Harris county elections administrator, told the Texas Tribune. “That’s our big question mark right now: are voters going to go through the extra step to correct it?” But officials have also said they hope the rate of rejected ballots will fall as more arrive. In Hays county, south-west of Austin, elections chief Jennifer Anderson, said and initial 25% rejection rate had dropped to 4% in recent days. “It seems like our outreach is working,” Anderson told the Washington Post. But the rejection rate has alarmed voting rights advocates attempting to gauge the impact of SB1, one of many voting laws enacted last year after false claims that the 2020 presidential race was colored by voter fraud. “Texans deserve to have confidence in the electoral system,” said state congressman Briscoe Cain, a leading Republican promoter of the Texas initiative that instituted uniform voting hours, expanded access for those who need assistance and enhanced access of party-affiliated poll watchers. SB1 requires Texas voters to provide either a state identification number, typically from a driver’s license, or the last four digits of their social security number, that match the ID number on their voter registration record. The bill also imposes new penalties for anyone who registers to vote or casts a ballot but is not eligible to do so. In addition, mail-in voting is available to those over 65, those who will be away from home on election day or can show they have a disability that prevents them from in-person voting. “I’m confident that local election officials will prioritize assisting voters through the process instead of gaslighting to gin up fear and confusion,” Cain said. The measures appear to potentially disqualify newcomers, often minority groups, from voting effectively in the typically white, conservative state. Jo Nell Yarbrough, a 76-year-old retired educator from the town of Katy, west of Houston, told the Post she’d received a letter informing her that she had failed to include an ID number on her ballot. “It feels like people were just sitting up late at night thinking up ways to discourage people from voting,” she said.",News/US news,New Texas voting rules causing high number of ballot rejections,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/12/texas-voting-requirements-ballot-rejections
