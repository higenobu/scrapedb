12/31/2021,"Romelu Lukaku has given an explosive interview in which he states he is “not happy” with his situation at Chelsea, as the problems continue to mount for Thomas Tuchel. Chelsea’s record signing, who rejoined from Internazionale for £97.5m in the summer, has endured a frustrating campaign under Tuchel so far but has recently found his shooting boots with goals in his last two outings for the European champions.  The striker has scored seven goals in 18 matches this season but has been inconsistent and not always started matches under the manager. It is understood the interview was recorded three weeks ago, before Lukaku’s return to scoring form while he has since praised his manager after the 3-1 win at Aston Villa. “Physically I am fine,” Lukaku told Sky Italy. “But I am not happy with the situation at Chelsea. Tuchel has chosen to play with another system. “I won’t give up. I will be professional. I am not happy with the situation but I am professional and I can’t give up now.” Lukaku, who fired Internazionale to the Serie A title in May, said that he hopes to one day return to Inter, adding: “Now it is the right time to share my feelings. I have always said that I have Inter in my head. I know I will return to Inter, I really hope so. I am in love with Italy.” The release of the interview will provide an irritating backdrop for Tuchel who has seen his resources stretched by injuries and Covid-19 in the last month. Chelsea face Liverpool at Stamford Bridge on Sunday and will be without Reece James after the defender injured his hamstring in Wednesday night’s 1-1 draw with Brighton. Chelsea were awaiting scan results but fear it could be a torn hamstring which would necessitate a lengthy layoff for the 22-year-old. Tuchel is already without wing-back Ben Chilwell for the rest of the season while Andreas Christensen is a serious doubt to face Liverpool and Thiago Silva missed Wednesday night’s game through injury. Chelsea will make a late decision on Silva’s thigh issue but also on a host of players still suffering lasting effects after contracting Covid-19, including Timo Werner. Tuchel said: “[Werner’s] not good, not in training. And that’s because of Covid. We don’t know any more at the moment, and nobody knows quite how the players [who have had Covid] will react. We play trial and error and see what we get. That’s why I’m protecting my team. We can play much better but we need a full squad over weeks and weeks.”",Sport/Football,Lukaku ‘not happy’ with Chelsea situation as problems mount for Tuchel,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/30/lukaku-not-happy-with-chelsea-situation-as-problems-mount-for-tuchel
12/31/2021,"Quebec healthcare workers exposed to Covid-19 may have to go to work sooner than expected if staffing levels in the Canadian province’s facilities reach a critical point. Quebec’s health minister, Christian Dubé, made the announcement earlier this week, explaining that in a worst-case scenario the province would have no choice but to insist that isolating employees return to work.  Cases of the Omicron variant have surged in the province: on Thursday, a record-breaking 14,188 new cases were reported, with 939 Covid patients currently in hospital and 138 in intensive care. The Quebec newspaper La Presse reported that hospitals in the province were getting close to activating the contingency plan. The Omicron wave has wreaked havoc on the province’s healthcare sector, which is already stretched thin. “A few days ago, 4,000 [healthcare workers] were absent. Yesterday was 7,000. In the coming days, it will be 10,000,” Dubé said at a news conference on Tuesday. On Wednesday afternoon, government health officials explained how the employee recall process would work. Asymptomatic employees who were randomly exposed to Covid – at a shopping centre or gym, for example – would not have to isolate at all. Instead, they would be asked to self-monitor their symptoms for 14 days and get tested every two or three days. If they tested positive for Covid, they would be required to isolate for seven to 10 days, depending on staffing conditions. If they tested negative, they would have to return immediately. However, they would also have to isolate themselves at work for 10 days. With testing capacities in the province currently overwhelmed, this could mean that staff who are asymptomatic but positive end up working in healthcare settings because they have not been able to obtain a test. During the technical briefing, Dr Yves Jalbert, the medical director of Quebec’s public health protection, said those employees would have to take their coffee and lunch breaks in isolated rooms. A media spokesperson for the health ministry told the Guardian that in situations where the worker had to be near uninfected colleagues or patients, personal protective equipment (PPE) would be required. This new contingency plan applies to healthcare workers – along with other essential service staff such as first responders – who have had at least two vaccine doses. Meanwhile, asymptomatic employees who have Covid in their household or who are in regular contact with an infected person will be required to isolate for seven days, regardless of their vaccination status. However, double-vaccinated workers could be recalled sooner in urgent staffing conditions. Public health representatives at the technical briefing said 98% of healthcare workers were double-vaccinated. They said these measures were a last resort to prevent a total healthcare system breakdown. As Dubé noted on Tuesday: “If we had the staff we needed, we wouldn’t have to do this.” Healthcare unions opposed Quebec’s decision, saying the measures put workers – as well as vulnerable patients – at too much of a risk. Réjean Leclerc, the president of a union representing 120,000 Quebec healthcare workers, told Reuters that the province couldn’t even keep up with staff testingin the current situation. “The network is not prepared to face the risks of the government’s decision to bring asymptomatic infected staff back to work,” he said. The government has not clarified how it will help hospitals and other healthcare facilities to create isolation rooms, nor how it would help exposed or infected workers who depend on public transit to get to work. Other Canadian provinces, including Ontario, are considering whether to follow in Quebec’s footsteps because of healthcare staff shortages across the country.",News/World news,Isolating Quebec health staff may have to return to work early under new plans,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/isolating-quebec-healthcare-workers-return-work-covid-canada
12/31/2021,"The hardest part of picking a moment from the sporting year is trying to remember which of them actually happened in 2021. Twelve months that simultaneously took forever and went by in an instant. Perhaps the pandemic. Perhaps just middle age. I’m quietly confident that Euro 2020 did happen – a blur of podcasts, radio shows at Wembley Boxpark, and England reaching the final of a major tournament for the first time in 55 years. Two days before the final I caught myself idly wondering if I actually wanted us to win. Was this the right time? So many England fans have pleaded: “Just once in my lifetime.” But if it did happen, what then? Where does the journey go?  Was this the right set of players to be deified for the next 50 years – to take the mantle from Moore, Charlton and Hurst? Supremely likable and talented, maybe – but I’ve seen John Stones have bad games. I’ve seen Luke Shaw have average seasons. I’ve spent so much time watching Kieran Trippier and Kyle Walker doing mundane things, just taking throw-ins and whipping crosses in to no one in particular. I’ve seen Harry Kane’s “let’s get them, lads” team talks. I’ve never seen Ray Wilson have a bad touch, nor George Cohen misplace a pass. I’ve never seen Bobby Charlton not score from 25 yards. Bobby Moore is always tackling Pelé and strolling away with the ball. Nobby Stiles just dances. For a short time in the 80s, when I was old enough to love football but too young to understand time, I thought Gordon Banks had won the World Cup with just one eye. How could Jordan Pickford compete with that? I’ve never seen any of them warm up, get substituted or send a mundane Insta post. @Bigjackiecharlton: “Great win against a tough Argentina side, bring on Portugal in the Semis.” Granted, I’ve barely seen any of the boys of ‘66 play a minute of football, aside from a digitally enhanced repeat of the final and a few grainy YouTube highlights. Since I knew what the game was, these 11 men were otherworldly superhumans – players who have improved as every year passes. Hurst’s shot always goes in the top corner. They’ve only ever won the World Cup. And they’ve done it time after time after time. A month before Italy broke our hearts, millions of us watched Christian Eriksen’s stop. Each chest compression was broadcast to the world as the director cut from family members to teammates and back. As a screen was erected around him like a faller at Becher’s Brook, social media raged about the cameras zooming in on a life ebbing away. Yet we carried on watching. There was an emptiness that hung in the air that afternoon and an inescapable relief when it emerged he was OK. We shouldn’t have seen it, but in a perverse way perhaps it was good that we did. It reminded us that the game didn’t matter – results didn’t matter. Life mattered. #Bekind – hug the ones you love. And more cliches. Live for the moment, carpe diem, break-down-the-Wembley-barricades-and-set-fireworks-off from-your-anus. I’d hosted a TalkSport show from a pub round the corner on the morning of the final. I was the only person getting on the tube at Wembley Park at 1pm as thousands of hammered, ticketless fans streamed the other way – you could tell it was going to be an ordeal for anyone in a hi-vis vest. And maybe that grand show of unpleasantness and stupidity eased the blow of the defeat. We were recording Guardian Football Daily in my living room straight after full-time. Producer Joel, John Brewin and I were representing England, with Barry Glendenning (Ire) and Elis James (Wal) neutral – or, more accurately, supporting Italy, one more vociferously than the other. By the time Shaw hammered home in the second minute, my midweek existential crisis had given way to the unedifying shouty faux-cockney that I appear to morph into during England games. I hadn’t become one of football’s great philosophers that week – I was just a man nervously drinking Peroni, eating Kettle Chips and yelling “SHAPE” for a 120 minutes. Every one of those penalties was excruciating. Even when we scored. Pickford keeping out Jorginho. The hope. The inevitability. Bukayo Saka’s miss. The silence. I have the emotional skillset to deal with desperate defeat. I wouldn’t have known what to do in victory. The neutrals were gracious. We recorded the pod. They waited until getting in Elis’s car before tenderly embracing. I don’t hold it against them. It must have felt so sweet – another two years (or 18 months) at least of hurt. No endless phone-ins demanding he become Sir Mason Mount just yet. The following morning, amid the depressingly predictable racist messages received by Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Saka, I was on an 8am train to Cornwall, my mockney accent stowed away until the next tournament. I read pages of reports of the previous night, picking over every aspect of it. And I didn’t mind – defeat was fine. We go again. The biggest sporting day of 2021 taught me something I already knew. I am desperate to win – I really, really care. But the moment it’s gone, it’s just gone. And it’s OK. Your team – club or country – doesn’t change. We all do go again. I look forward to the draw, the wallchart, the endless speculation about who will play at left-back, the frantic calls from people who should know better to play all of the attackers all of the time. It will all come round again in Qatar in November; given the shameful nature of everything connected with that tournament, the results will matter even less. I think of the boys of ’66 we lost this year. I think of Eriksen, alive and planning his future. The results are the least important part.",Sport/Football,My main lesson from 2021?
