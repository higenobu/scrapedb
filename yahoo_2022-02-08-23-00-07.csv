2/8/2022,"After digging out from another snowy week, we've heard the usual gripes about dibs and uncleared side streets. Ald. Ray López went so far as to remove dibs junk in his ward. Some have suggested temporarily banning parking on one side of the street — as they do in Minneapolis–St. Paul and Evanston — to let plows clear it. Why it matters: Chicago has already made two notably disastrous attempts to do this. Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free In 1979, Mayor Richard Bilandic failed to fully clear public lots that were supposed to hold cars while the plows came through. In 2000, folks claimed insufficient notice about moving their cars. What they're saying: Chicago's Chief Snow Officer (aka Streets and Sanitation Commissioner) Cole Stallard says the city's plowing system is getting much more efficient through a navigation app that tracks drivers and shows optimal routes for the streets that need more plowing. The city won't try the Evanston/Twin Cities method of moving cars for plowing this year, but Stallard says he will be commissioning ""experts to compile data on the number of cars and temporary parking spaces we'd need to make it work."" As for the great dibs debate, Stallard dodged this question like it was a barrage of icy snowballs. He said instead that he'll send warnings out at the end of February for people to ""take your aunt's favorite chair back inside."" The big picture: Stallard asks Chicagoans to ""be neighborly"" and help others on the block. He also asks that snow be shoveled onto the parkway, not ""back into the middle of the street after plows have come through."" What's next: We'll follow up later this year on that feasibility study on moving cars for plowing. Side streets looked like this on Sunday in south Minneapolis, where folks move their cars to let plows get through Photo: Torey Van Oot/Axios More from Axios: Sign up to get the latest market trends with Axios Markets.

2/8/2022,"42% of service members of color in a new survey turned down an assignment or permanent change of station order because of concerns about racism and discrimination, even when they knew doing so could negatively affect their career because of perceptions of racism in the local community. The survey, organized by Blue Star Families, found that more than 40% of active-duty family respondents also factored in concerns about racial discrimination or safety when listing their basing preferences. About 33% of active-duty families and 34% of veterans in the survey also reported that concerns about racial and ethnic discrimination were a factor in conversations with family members about whether to stay in the military. Read Next: Another Leaked Video Offers a Dramatic View of F-35C Crash Aboard Carl Vinson The findings were part of the Blue Star Families' ""Social Impact Research 2021: The Diverse Experiences of Military & Veteran Families of Color,"" which surveyed 2,731 people, including 622 active-duty spouses, 303 active-duty service members and 306 veterans. Researchers stressed several limitations with their methodology, which sought out respondents of color rather than getting a random sample, meaning the results aren't statistically representative of all active-duty and veteran families of color and do not include a comparison group of white respondents. But Blue Star Families argued the survey still represents an important starting point for an area of research that has been lacking. ""Around the George Floyd murder and the unrest that summer, we started to recognize that one thing we hadn't been paying as much attention to as we should have is, what are the experiences of military families of color,"" Kathy Roth-Douquet, CEO of Blue Star Families, said last week at a virtual event launching the report. ""What we came to understand is, actually no one had ever asked these questions before. ... There's sort of a culture of silence about this because it's not what we aspire to be or what we aspire to experience."" The majority of service members surveyed -- about 79% -- said being in the military has had a positive influence on their professional growth, and 70% said they feel respected by their peers and a sense of belonging in the military. But many also reported safety concerns, racial profiling by police, racial slurs and other forms of discrimination. 57% of active-duty family respondents reported hearing military-connected peers make racist comments or jokes and about 46% said they have been the subject of slurs or jokes in their military community at least once since January 2020, according to the report. About 41% of active-duty family respondents said they feared for their personal safety in their military community due to their ethnicity or race at least once since January 2020, with some citing displays of the Confederate flag or discussions about politics ""in ways they viewed to be coded racism"" as factors that made them feel unsafe. And about 33% of Black active-duty family respondents reported being racially profiled by military law enforcement at least once since January 2020, compared with about 36% who said they were profiled by civilian law enforcement. Still, about 49% of Black active-duty family respondents reported trust in military law enforcement, compared with 30% for civilian law enforcement. Meanwhile, about 39% of active-duty service member respondents said their race or ethnicity ""significantly"" or ""slightly"" hurt their ability to get ahead at work, including about 48% of Black respondents. ""This is just the beginning of the work ahead,"" the co-chairs of Blue Star Families' racial equity and inclusion committee wrote in the 189-page report. ""It is our hope that findings from this report will serve as a framework for policy and program recommendations that will help improve the service experiences of military families of color, strengthening our military overall."" -- Rebecca Kheel can be reached at rebecca.kheel@military.com.

2/8/2022,"YANQING, China — U.S. skier Nina O’Brien suffered an open fracture of her left tibia and fibula in a frightening crash during Monday’s Olympic giant slalom, a U.S. ski team spokeswoman said Tuesday. O’Brien, 24, was treated on the scene, then transported to a hospital in Yanqing, the Beijing district where Alpine skiing events are being held. Local doctors there performed surgery to stabilize the bones in her leg. “I’ll get the rest fixed at home,” O’Brien said in an Instagram post from her hospital bed. She’ll travel back to the U.S. for “further evaluation and care,” according to the spokeswoman. O’Brien, skiing at her first Olympics, entered the second of two giant slalom runs in sixth place, after a morning run that was “really fun.” She said the hill was “in perfect shape.” Toward the end of that second run, though, she lost balance after clipping one of the final gates. Her skis split, her knee appeared to bend underneath her at an awkward angle, and she tumbled toward and over the finish line as her skis and poles went flying. A few dozen feet away, multiple skiers brought their hands to their mouths in horror. Teammate Mikaela Shiffrin, who’d slipped out of her first run earlier in the day, bowed her head and covered her eyes. O’Brien wrote Tuesday that she has been replaying the run in her mind, “wishing I’d skied those last few gates differently. But here we are.” “I gave everything I had,” she said, “and maybe too much.” O’Brien lay on her side, her lower body motionless, as she shook her helmeted head a few seconds after the crash. Over a dozen venue personnel eventually helped tend to her as the finish area went eerily silent. They wrapped her in blue tarp-like garment and pulled her away from the course so the competition could continue. In her post-surgery Instagram post she thanked “everyone who’s taken care of me, especially those who rushed to me in the finish and my doctors and nurses in Yanqing.” “I’m a little heartbroken, but also feeling so much love,” the California native wrote. “Thank you to everyone who’s reached out. My phone is flooded with messages, and waking up to your words means more than you know.”",U.S./Yahoo Sports,American skier Nina O’Brien suffers multiple leg fractures in scary crash at Olympics,https://news.yahoo.com/american-skier-nina-o-brien-suffers-multiple-leg-fractures-in-scary-crash-at-olympics-040052547.html
2/8/2022,"Anderson Cooper 360 Monday was joined by 17-year-old high school senior Ethan Lynne, who on Saturday was attacked by the Twitter account run by new Republican governor of Virginia Glenn Youngkin’s campaign. “I was surprised. I could not believe this was real,” Lynne said. “I never thought we would get to the place where a governor is attacking his constituents online. That's something that Donald Trump would do. He promised he would be different than Trump and take out — and our politics have become too toxic.” The now-deleted tweet from Youngkin’s campaign showed a picture of Lynne with former Virginia Governor Ralph Northam with a reminder of Northam’s racially insensitive younger days. It came in response to a story Lynne posted from a local television station about a historian resigning from the governor’s mansion that may have painted Youngkin in a negative light. On Monday, Youngkin posted a tweet stating that the campaign’s post was unauthorized, but that didn’t go far enough for Lynne. “I thought it was a non-apology. He’s just sorry that the whole situation happened, he’s not actually sorry for what was said,” Lynne said. “He didn't even take credit that it was his campaign team account, he said that it was a campaign account and did not strongly condemn the situation in any way, shape, or form.” ETHAN LYNNE: I never thought we would get to the place where a governor is attacking his constituents online. That's something that Donald Trump would do. He promised he will be different than Trump and take out-- and that our politics have become too toxic. So not only do I hope he apologizes, I hope he condemns what happens in a stronger way. KYLIE MAR: On Anderson Cooper 360 Monday, with guest host John Berman, 17-year-old high school student Ethan Lynne joined the show to speak about being attacked on Twitter on Saturday by Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin's campaign account in a now deleted tweet. On Monday, Governor Youngkin posted a tweet saying that it was unauthorized, but Lynne says that's not enough. ETHAN LYNNE: I thought it was a non-apology. He's just sorry that the whole situation happened. He's not actually sorry for what was said. He didn't even take credit that it was his campaign team account. He just said that it was a campaign account and did not strongly condemn the situation in any way, shape, or form. KYLIE MAR: The tweet from the Youngkin campaign came in response to Lynne posting a story from a local station about a historian resigning from the governor's mansion. Lynne believes it's beneath the Office of the governor. ETHAN LYNNE: I've been active in politics from a young age. But whether I'm a Democrat or not, active or not, Governor Youngkin should not be attacking or cyberbullying his constituents online. He promised he will be different as governor, and unfortunately, he's been proven wrong by this. KYLIE MAR: And Lynne said he'd like a real apology from Youngkin. ETHAN LYNNE: I would like an apology to me and my family. But the only way to stop this is by publicly condemning this type of bullying and rhetoric in politics. The governor should be setting a better example for students like me.",Politics/Yahoo Entertainment,Teenager who was cyberbullied by GOP governor’s campaign says it’s 'something that Donald Trump would do',https://news.yahoo.com/teenager-cyberbullied-gop-governor-campaign-070610229.html
2/8/2022,"
 A Georgia prosecutor investigating former President Trump's efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election said in a new interview that presidential immunity will not protect him from being prosecuted in the state. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis told CNN that the argument Trump's lawyers have made in the past concerning presidential immunity would not stand up in court. ""Of course, I've given thought to if that may be raised as a legal issue,"" Willis said. ""I don't think that that protection will prevent a prosecution if that becomes necessary in this state case,"" she added. Last year, Willis began investigating whether Trump or his allies committed any crimes as they attempted to persuade Georgia officials to look for voter fraud in order to secure the former president a victory in the state. The investigation was prompted by a call Trump had with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R), encouraging him to look for votes that would overturn the election, CNN noted. ""You and I have listened to that phone call. But also I have the benefit of also having talked to a lot of witnesses and probably having read more on this than most people would like to,"" Willis told the network. She also said that she is not concerned about Trump attempting to delay her investigation, adding that she will ""use the power of the law"" if necessary once grand jury proceedings begin in the spring. ""This is a criminal investigation. We're not here playing a game,"" Willis told CNN. ""I plan to use the power of the law. We are all citizens."" ""Mr. Trump, just as every other American citizen, is entitled to dignity. He's entitled to be treated fairly. He will be treated fairly in this jurisdiction,"" she added. ""But I plan to do my job and my job is to make sure that we get the evidence that gives us the truth. I'm not concerned at all about games to delay this."" Last month, Fulton County Superior Court judges approved Willis's request for a special grand jury to investigate Trump's actions in office. She also reportedly has plans to begin issuing subpoenas in May. ""The special-purpose grand jury not only has the power to subpoena witnesses to come to testify, but also other evidence that may be relevant, whether that's emails, letters, phone calls, whatever you could imagine,"" she told CNN. ""When I sit down, I will have done everything that I know how to do to bring a fair and true picture. And so they're welcome to their opinions,"" Willis later added, speaking of her critics who argue she should speed up or narrow her probe. ""But while I sit here as the elected DA, we're going to do things so that the American public can be confident we did everything we knew how to do to bring justice.""",Politics/The Hill,Georgia prosecutor says presidential immunity won't protect Trump,https://news.yahoo.com/georgia-prosecutor-says-presidential-immunity-123216718.html
