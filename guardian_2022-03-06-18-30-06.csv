3/6/2022,"Hugh O’Shaughnessy, the admired journalist known for his reporting on Latin America, has died aged 87. The former Observer correspondent won a series of awards during an illustrious career largely spent covering the rapidly changing social and political landscape of South America. He was perhaps best known for his courageous coverage of the coup by Augusto Pinochet, when the military dictator seized power in Chile in 1973. Choosing to stay on in Santiago to cover the fallout of the coup, O’Shaughnessy went on to document Pinochet’s authoritarian rule, during which tens of thousands of opponents were tortured. The Irish journalist also wrote a number of books and, in 1977, founded the Latin American Bureau, an online and print publisher of independent news about the region’s struggles for social and environmental justice. In total, O’Shaughnessy covered events on the continent for more than 40 years. His eldest child, Frances, 60, paid tribute to a fearless character who was an inspiration to his four children. “He always did what was right, he always called it out. And he had a fantastic sense of humour, he was a real life force.” She also said that behind the image of the intrepid foreign correspondent was a kind man whose primary interest was meeting people. “There was a real human kindness to him. He was immensely interested in people, where they were from, the kind of lives they were living.” O’Shaughnessy died peacefully on Tuesday last week. His wife, Georgina, died in 2011.",News/Media,Acclaimed foreign correspondent Hugh O’Shaughnessy dies aged 87,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/06/acclaimed-foreign-correspondent-hugh-oshaughnessy-dies-aged-87
3/6/2022,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak is under renewed pressure from MPs and business groups to rethink plans to increase national insurance next month, as fears grow that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will dramatically worsen the cost of living crisis and plunge the economy into “stagflation”. Both Tory and Labour MPs believe Sunak can still be persuaded to ditch the 1.25 percentage point rise – announced last September to fund the NHS and social care – and want him to use the potentially devastating effects of events in Ukraine on prices as justification for what they say is an urgently needed U-turn. Former cabinet minister David Davis said on Saturday that history showed big rises in oil and gas prices tended to trigger stagflation – when prices soar and economic output collapses at the same time. What was needed, he said, was lower taxation as part of a concerted strategy to stimulate growth. Davis said: “The case for dropping this rise is even stronger after recent events. We know there are those in government who favour cancelling the rise, and this [Ukraine] gives it a reason for changing its mind.” Many senior Tories, including cabinet minister Jacob Rees-Mogg and the chair of the Treasury select committee, Mel Stride, have already called for the 1.25 percentage point rise to be dropped. But the government vowed before the Russian invasion of Ukraine to push ahead. Now, however, the economic context has deteriorated. The invasion has caused oil and gas prices to rise steeply, while supplies from Ukraine of everything from barley to copper and nickel are disrupted. Ukraine is known as the “bread basket of Europe” and its ability to provide for foreign markets is expected to be severely hit, with a consequent effect on prices. Today the Federation of Small Businesses urges ministers to mitigate the impact on its members of the national insurance rise – and rises in dividend taxes – warning that, without help, businesses in the very areas the government has promised to “level up” will be hardest hit. The FSB wants an increase in special allowances that give small employers discounts on their national insurance bills, to offset the effects of the rise. Its analysis shows that the rise will add more than £3,000 to the annual tax bill of the average small business. Those businesses will also have to cope with an increase to £9.50 in the “national living wage” for employees over the age of 23 from early April. FSB national chair Mike Cherry said: “The government’s levelling-up plans are now at serious risk. The chilling impact of national insurance hikes will hit the pay of those in regions that need help the most.” “Slamming small firms with a jobs tax hike will put the brakes on investment, upskilling and growth within communities most affected by the pandemic. “At its forthcoming spring statement, the government can still make a difference by increasing the employment allowance to £5,000 and adopting our proposal to take an additional 200,000 small firms out of the business rates system in levelling up target areas.” The government’s analysis says that in the 2022-23 tax year, someone earning the median basic rate taxpayer’s income of £24,100 will pay an additional £180 a year in national insurance, while someone earning the median higher rate taxpayer’s income of £67,100 will pay an additional £715. It says the rise will also have a “significant impact” on more than 1.6 million employers. Labour is also intensifying its calls for the rise to be dropped. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the timing could not be worse for householders or businesses: “Many are feeling their money already stretch less far. Our British businesses hold the key to our economic recovery – this is not the time to put yet another burden on them. The government are trapping us in a high-tax, low-growth cycle. It’s time for them to look again at Labour’s proposal for a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producers to cut household energy bills by up to £600 by getting rid of VAT on home energy bills and extending the warm homes discount.” In January, Boris Johnson and Sunak wrote a joint newspaper article insisting they would press ahead with the rise despite pressure from their own backbenchers to think again. “We must go ahead with the health and care levy,” they said. “It is progressive: the burden falls most on those who can most afford it. “Every penny of that £39bn will go on crucial objectives – including 9 million more checks, scans and operations, and 50,000 more nurses, as well as boosting social care.”",News/Politics,Ukraine crisis puts Sunak under new pressure to axe national insurance rise,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/06/ukraine-crisis-puts-sunak-under-new-pressure-to-axe-national-insurance-rise
3/6/2022,"We are a quarter of the way through the year, almost. March is a capricious month, never knowing what it will bring: early sunshine, snow? I think of the months of the year as characters. January is female, and late to motherhood, February her inappropriately indulged first born, who makes all those it comes into contact with miserable. March, the second child, does its own thing and keeps everyone insecure and guessing (the other months are various other members of the family. November is favourite uncle, April is favourite aunt…) Anyway, where was I? The moment I heard about White Rabbit’s Breakfast in Bed bar, £3/55g, I knew I had to have it. This sees 56% dark milk chocolate mixed with coffee and feuilletine – pastries and coffee – and it is delicious. It was made ostensibly for Mother’s Day, but ignore that and buy it for yourself whatever your gender and status. It’s quite simple: if you love coffee, chocolate and flakey croissants you’re going to adore this. White Rabbit is an independent chocolatier in Yorkshire – keen readers may remember I loved its honeycomb chunks last year. This year I can’t get enough of its marshmallow dunkers, £3.75, enrobed in milk or dark. Sometimes a chocolate treat just works if it involves almost dislocating your jaw to get it in your mouth. These were made to dunk in hot milk, but I ate them as snacks – in fact, the whole family went at them like a pack of dogs. It was unsightly, but satisfying.

3/6/2022,"“Humankind,” in TS Eliot’s opinion, “cannot bear very much reality”, but our goggling, glutted species seems able to bear any amount of reality TV. American broadcast schedules devote fully half their time to unscripted programmes, which claim to be spying on reality, though they’re more often flagrantly surreal in their exposure of oddity, perversity and downright monstrosity. Here we have today’s equivalent to the nightmare alleys in itinerant carnivals, where customers used to titter at fat ladies, gasp at shaggy wolfmen and shudder as caged geeks bit the heads off live chickens. In True Story, the academic sociologist Danielle J Lindemann takes a studious tour of the terrain. She finds toddlers with waxed eyebrows and spray-tanned legs competing in beauty contests: one precocious three-year-old mimics Julia Roberts playing a hooker in Pretty Woman and a seductress aged only two sports the spiky-nippled bra popularised by Madonna. Teenagers queue up to have Dr Pimple Popper squeeze little geysers of pus from their oily faces. At the Redneck Games – an Olympiad for the obese – hillbillies perform belly-flops in mud pits, bob for pigs’ trotters and loudly fart out of sheer delight. Elsewhere, a young woman snacks on the foam innards of her sofa cushions; not to be outdone, a much larger woman in a tent-size purple T-shirt consumes entire mattresses, chomping down to the box springs. A black man with elephantiasis of the testicles needs a hoodie to support his ballooning scrotum. He groans about the load he has to tote around between his bow legs, but is happy to display it to the cameras. It seems that every American has a constitutionally guaranteed right to life, liberty and the pursuit of celebrity and reality TV is the approved career path for those whose only distinction is an exhibitionistic id. One of my favourites is a tiny, thong-clad hoyden known as Snooki, who rampages through a beach resort in Jersey Shore and tussles with randy young men in a frothing hot tub. Proudly self-invented, when asked about her family, Snooki snarls: “I could be birthed from, like, dragons and squirrels.” Cardi B’s trajectory is even dizzier. She begins as a self-styled “gangsta bitch” in the Bronx, works as a stripper while telling her mother that she’s babysitting, transitions to rap after a spell on a show called Love & Hip Hop: New York, then sets herself up as an Afro-Latina tribune of the people and is allowed to quiz Joe Biden about his policies during the 2020 election campaign. To establish her primacy, she arrives late for her Zoom call with the presidential candidate. Such hydraulic ascents couldn’t happen over here. Whether they’re set in Chelsea or Essex, British reality shows keep people in the categories to which birth and geography have assigned them and aspiration is punished by disgrace or death: hence Katie Price’s current tiffs with the traffic cops, the cancelling of Jeremy Kyle and the sad expiry of Big Brother’s Jade Goody. Lindemann laments the timidity of our local products. Love Island, she scoffs, “pays lip service (pun intended) to the notion of romantic love”; an American equivalent wouldn’t euphemise all that casual coupling in the tropical underbrush. When the producers of The Real World moved the housemates to London for a season, the soggy tedium of the location almost killed the show off. Should we be proud that reality, on these sinking islands, has proved to be so intractable? Characters on the shows Lindemann studies are shamelessly hedonistic, but she treats her own addiction to the genre as a guilty pleasure and frets to extract some educational value from it. She cites an ethicist who claims that reality TV is “a tool for inclusivity” and a professor of religious studies who believes that Keeping Up With the Kardashians offers meditative balm for distracted souls. Finally, Lindemann compresses her hundreds of binge-watching hours into a series of “teachable moments”, which reveal how a culture imposes the “social fictions” of race, class or gender and stigmatises those who deviate from its arbitrary norms. This liberal agenda leaves me unconvinced: the starkest and most brutal of the reality shows dramatise more elemental struggles, in which all of us are muckily embroiled. Sexual selection is managed with ruthless briskness in The Millionaire Matchmaker, where the gold-diggers jostling for a date with a rich bachelor are told: “The penis does the picking.” In Big Brother, sacrificial victims are marked out for mockery and character assassination. Survivor is about a battle to the metaphorical death and in Naked and Afraid castaways have to fight their way out of the wilderness armed only with machetes or fire-starters. The broadcaster Ted Koppel once asked whether reality TV was “the way a civilisation ends”, to which the novelist Kurt Vonnegut smartly retaliated by demanding”: “What makes you think we have a civilisation?” Yes, the barbarians have stormed the citadel and they celebrate their conquest by uproariously farting.

3/6/2022,"The far right is increasingly recruiting via online fitness groups, whose popularity soared during the pandemic, prompting fears that new members are being radicalised to commit acts of violence, new analysis shows. Researchers have detected a network of online “fascist fitness” chat groups on the messaging app Telegram with a large number directly linked to the neo-Nazi Patriotic Alternative, Britain’s biggest extreme right group. European and US fight groups are regularly glorified in these groups, including the white supremacist Rise Above Movement (RAM), notorious for having four members arrested in 2018 for inciting and participating in violence against anti-racist protesters. Among the UK groups to laud RAM is the White Stag Athletic Club (WSAC), whose members post images of swastika flags, and celebrated the acquittal last November of Kyle Rittenhouse, who shot dead two anti-racist protesters in Wisconsin in 2020. At-home fitness boomed during the pandemic with some digital fitness apps attracting tens of millions of users and online groups proliferating to replace gym closures. Analysis by anti-fascist organisation Hope Not Hate says the British far right has positioned physical fitness as part of a “wider political struggle” and helped explain how online groups like WSAC could grow even after Covid restrictions have been lifted. “The danger of these groups lies, firstly, in their emphasis on transforming activists into soldiers that might be motivated to commit acts of violence. And, secondly, in the community they create, where members start to associate sometimes real, positive change in their lives with fascism,” said the organisation’s annual assessment of the extreme right. Senior researcher Patrik Hermansson said: “These fitness groups frame individual self-improvement as a part of a wider political struggle, creating fresh motivation and a sense of purpose for people who believe that physical confrontation and violence are legitimate and necessary. They have become a space for far-right activists to mobilise.” Formed during the pandemic, WSAC is run by a Yorkshire-based security guard who uses the pseudonym ‘Sarge’. He has been linked to Patriotic Alternative (PA), which previously helped launch a fascist podcast whose Telegram channel recently featured PA’s leader Mark Collett and far-right YouTuber Laura Towler. Recently, WSAC widened its recruitment efforts on Telegram with members “eventually expected to take part in fights with one another”, suggesting the group’s intention to increase its capacity for violence. Observing fitness groups over several months, Hermansson monitored how members were initially lured in with health tips and later encouraged into the closed chat groups where the far right shared content. For instance users such as “Dan” who joined one of the larger “fitness fascist” Telegram groups in July 2021 lost 45lb in weight and graduated from member to administrator, posting almost daily. “Associating positive change in one’s life with a violent and hateful ideology is obviously dangerous,” said Hermansson. Among images posted on the groups are photos of torsos with stickers of Hitler’s face. One admin of a group posted a picture of himself in a gym mirror with the message “training to stop a bus loaded with [philanthropist George] Soros paid protesters”. Another member said: “Defend your race, defend your land, achieve immortality.” “Ready to join the SS,” added one anonymous user after posting a shirtless picture of himself in the gym mirror. A number accused other men of being “low T” meaning having low levels of testosterone and therefore linked to what they view as a “weak” and “effeminate” political establishment. Ben Elley, a researcher, said that members of far-right self-improvement groups believed that by becoming physically stronger they could help prevent the white race from destruction. He added that self-improvement “become part of a righteous Manichean battle, greatly distorting the balance of input and reward that might normally be expected”. Oswald Mosley and his British Union of Fascists also emphasised the importance of physical fitness to his supporters, with the party organising sports clubs and its magazine featuring a weekly keep fit column.",News/Politics,‘Fascist fitness’: how the far right is recruiting with online gym groups ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/06/fascist-fitness-how-the-far-right-is-recruiting-with-online-gym-groups
3/6/2022,"In 1857, the English poet and Chartist leader Ernest Jones wrote a series of articles in the People’s Paper about the “Indian Mutiny” of that year. It was, he observed, no “mutiny” but a “national insurrection” that Britons should support as much as they had supported similar struggles in Europe. Britons were “on the side of Poland” when it “struggled for its freedom against Russia”. If Poland was “right”, Jones insisted, then “so is Hindostan”. I was reminded of his argument as I read and listened to some of the commentary about Ukrainian resistance to the Russian invasion. The invasion is brutal and unacceptable, an assault on democracy and sovereignty. We should oppose it just as we should oppose the Saudi assault on Yemen. We should support the people of Ukraine just as we should the people of Syria. Not so, says the Telegraph’s Tim Stanley. On BBC Radio 4’s Thought for the Day slot, he insisted that Ukraine moves us more than Syria or Yemen because it is “a European country” and “the young men volunteering or being conscripted could be our sons or fathers”. Apparently, it’s so much more difficult to imagine what a father or son must feel facing the prospect of war in Yemen or Iraq. For the Tory lord and former MEP Daniel Hannan the Ukraine conflict is shocking because “they seem so like us”, living in “a European country” where “people watch Netflix and have Instagram accounts”. “Civilisation itself is under attack in Ukraine,” he concluded. Unlike in the destruction of Syria or Afghanistan. Many others on both sides of the Atlantic have proffered similar views. What is expressed here is not simply the shock of witnessing a brutal conflict in a relatively peaceful and prosperous continent like Europe (though it’s barely 30 years since the Balkans were ripped apart by an even more vicious conflict). It is, rather, the belief that our capacity to empathise with people’s hopes, fears and suffering is defined by whether they are “like us”. It’s an argument that circumscribes solidarity along lines of identity. One of the ironies of much rightwing criticism of identity politics is the obliviousness to their own wallowing in the swamp of identity. There is an irony, too, in that the place of eastern Europeans and of Russians in the western imagination has always been ambiguous. Today, Europeans might embrace Ukrainians as “one of us”. It has not always been so. There is a long history of bigotry towards Slavs, of viewing them as primitive and “Asiatic”. For the influential 19th-century German historian Heinrich von Treitschke, “hatred of Slavs… is deep in our blood” because the Slav is “a born slave”. Edward Ross, one of America’s leading sociologists at the turn of the 20th century, called for Slavic migrants to be barred from America because they “belong in skins in wattled huts at the close of the Great Ice Age”. “A Slav can live in dirt that would kill a white man”, he wrote. The 1917 Russian Revolution was cast by many in racial terms. The prominent white supremacist Lothrop Stoddard viewed the Russian population as “made up chiefly of primitive racial strains… which have always shown an instinctive hostility to civilisation”. Another American writer, Clinton Stoddard Burr, saw Bolshevism as “fundamentally an Asiatic conception which is repugnant to the western mind”. For Hitler, the “real frontier” was not between Europe and Asia but “the one that separates the Germanic world from the Slav world”. He saw Ukrainians as the “redskins” of Europe: “We’ll supply the Ukrainians with scarves, glass beads and everything that colonial people like”, he contemptuously remarked. Such sentiments still find expression. In 2018, the Wall Street Journal published an article on Putin’s diplomacy headlined “Russia’s Turn to Its Asian Past”. The boundaries of those who are “like us”, of those who are European, of even those who are considered “white”, are not fixed but shift according to political and social need. And those ever-changing boundaries are defined as much by those deemed to be not like us as by those whom we acknowledge are. This is most noticeable in discussions about refugees. In the space of a week, a million refugees have fled Ukraine, half of them to Poland. That figure could rise in the coming weeks to four million. There has been much chaos and desperation in the rush to leave Ukraine. But in the receiving countries, the refugees have been met with great generosity, with open arms and open borders. (A notable exception is Britain, where the public supports a liberal policy but the government continues to drag its feet.) Compare this to the debate on the “refugee crisis” of 2015 when Europe was apparently overwhelmed by an “invasion”. That year, Europe received 1.3m asylum applications, a sharp jump in numbers because of the Syrian war. The figures before and since have been much lower. Yet that one year, in which the total number of asylum seekers was barely more than that in a week from Ukraine, has become totemic of an overwhelmed continent, the reason for strengthening Fortress Europe and for holding hundreds of thousands inthe most appalling conditions on both sides of the Mediterranean. The issue is one not of numbers but of political will and of the social and imaginative boundaries we draw. The EU president Ursula von der Leyen last week insisted that Ukraine “belongs in the European family”. One of her first acts on becoming EU president in 2019 was to move responsibility for immigration into a new portfolio for “Promoting Our European Way of Life”, the task of which included protecting it from “irregular migration”. Refugees from Ukraine are part of the “European way of life”. Those from beyond are not. That is how boundaries are marked to delimit empathy and solidarity. In 1857, an editorial in the People’s Paper acknowledged that “we have avowedly shown ourselves on the Indian side” because support for “democracy must be consistent”. Anyone who says: “‘I am for Hungary, and against India’”, it observed, “ lies against himself, against principle, against truth, against honour.” Ernest Jones and the People’s Paper understood that solidarity means little if it is constrained by race and identity. There are many today who still need to learn that lesson.  Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",Opinion/Opinion,The people of Ukraine need our solidarity. But not just because they’re ‘like us’ | Kenan Malik,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/06/people-of-ukraine-need-our-solidarity-not-just-because-theyre-like-us
3/6/2022,"Energy customers receiving details of how much their energy bills will rise in April are braced for higher costs – but a big leap in standing charges has already taken many by surprise. For millions of customers on variable rate tariffs the daily charge for electricity, applied whether you use any power or not, will leap, with some set to pay 80% more when they take effect in spring. While many expected rising unit prices, driven by the increase in the wholesale cost of gas, they are questioning why other charges have gone up so much. One Observer reader got in touch last week about what she described as an “inexplicable” rise in her electricity standing charge. A customer of SSE (now owned by Ovo), she said the rise in unit price from 20.6p to 28.46p was “reasonable in the scheme of things” but questioned why the standing charge was going up from 24.11p to 43.39p a day. Her annual bill is set to rise by almost £300, of which the electricity standing charge makes up more than £70. “It’s the price of the energy that has changed, not the system of delivery, so I am struggling to understand how this is justified,” she says. Ovo did not comment. On social media customers from a wide range of suppliers have posted reported rises of about 20p a day, or £73 a year. One Twitter user posted that on his mother’s bill the standing charge for electricity had almost doubled, while another complained theirs had gone from £8.43 to £13.43 a month “before I even switch a lightbulb on”. Another wrote: “I can understand a rise in unit prices, but not the standing charge. Even if we cut our usage we have to pay that.” Standing charges are a daily fee for gas and electricity customers and are added to your bill regardless of how much energy you use. Ofgem does not set a limit on this part of your bill – it is down to suppliers how they break down unit and standing charge prices below its overall cap. However, it does make assumptions about how this will be done and, confusingly, publishes average standing charges on its website. These suggest that, from 1 April, direct debit customers will typically pay 45p a day to their electricity provider – up from 25p a day now – and 27p a day for gas – up from 26p now. Those increases add £76.65 a year to an average bill. Ofgem also suggests the highest standing charges are paid by those who have a prepayment meter, or settle their bills by cash and cheque. For prepayment customers, it suggests electricity standing charges will typically be 50p a day, and gas 37p. For cash and cheque customers it suggests electricity standing charges will be 51p a day and gas 32p. These are in line with the changes many providers are communicating to customers. British Gas has told customers its standing charges for electricity will be 45p for those with a direct debit, 50p for prepayment meters and 51p for cash and cheque. Gas standing charges will be 27p, 37p and 32p respectively. Shell Energy recently warned those living in the east of England that its electricity standing charge was rising from 24.01p to 37.92p a day, or £138 a year. It’s not as big as some, but still represents a 57% rise. The rate for each unit of electricity is up by 40% to 29.24p per kWh. In comparison, its gas standing charges are set to increase just over 4%, but the cost of each unit consumed is rising by an astonishing 81% from 4.05p to 7.34p per kWh. Other suppliers are imposing similar increases. Joe Malinowski, founder of price comparison website, TheEnergyShop.com, says electricity standing charges have almost doubled since 1 January 2019, when the Ofgem price cap was introduced. Then, electricity standing charges for customers paying by direct debit were averaging 22.77p a day. On 1 April this is set to rise to 45.34p. Over the same period, he says, gas standing charges have risen 5.4%. Standing charges cover a range of costs faced by suppliers. Rory Stoves, from comparison website Energyhelpline, says for electricity these include network costs – running and maintaining the system, the supplier of last resort scheme, and things such as the warm home discount. Stoves says network costs “inevitably go up, especially when inflation is high, as there are rising costs for wages, materials and so on”. But a far bigger part of the increase is from the “supplier of last resort” scheme – every household is expected to pay the billions that have gone into rescuing customers from failed companies. Last week, energy analysts at Cornwall Insight said they expected average annual dual-fuel bills could be as high as £2,900 come October. “Regulatory changes ordered by Ofgem were already set to add around £30 to each customer’s standing charge,” says Andrew Enzor, managing consultant at Cornwall Insight. “Since then, there have been a wave of company failures, with each one requiring a bailout, the cost of which is being shared by all consumers. “We calculate the cost will add a further £35 a year per household. Both of these are added to electricity bills, at a time when households can least afford it.” Stoves says with 29 companies failing in 2021, there is a high cost associated with looking after their customers. “Balances are protected when people are switched to a new supplier, but there is money missing because companies have invested some of it, so it has to be clawed back,” he says. This is added to electricity standing charges, as every home has a supply, unlike gas. For customers who want to reduce their bills, standing charges are, unfortunately, not something you can do much about. When the energy market is more competitive, there are sometimes tariffs available without standing charges, but they have higher unit prices so it’s only worth switching if you use very little. Currently, most of us are stuck with our existing provider and the prospect of further rises. Stoves says the “supplier of last resort” element in the current prices “is based on what Ofgem know so far about the cost – there might be more in the next cap, too”.",Lifestyle/Money,Why is my standing charge up by 80%?

3/6/2022,"Even at its most fantastical, dance is powerful because its roots are in real life. And ballet’s history links it ineluctably to the politics of its day. The ties between life and art are a complex web. For an example, take last Tuesday at the Royal Opera House, where tsarist Russia’s most enduring classical ballet, Swan Lake, was revived in a production starring the Russian-born Vadim Muntagirov, who has been a leading light of British ballet his entire career. Before the performance began, he dedicated his performance to the people of Ukraine, a sentiment emphasised when the Royal Ballet’s director, Kevin O’Hare, addressed the audience, expressing the solidarity of the entire company with the people of Ukraine. The Ukrainian national anthem was played. Everyone stood, including – as far as I could see – all the Russians in the house. The intense emotion rivalled anything we were likely to see on stage, in a production that has its own complicated origins as the final creative contribution to the Royal Ballet of the choreographer Liam Scarlett, who last year took his life at the age of 35 after allegations of sexual misconduct that were never upheld. It’s not a version of the ballet I much like. It tinkers round the edge of the story to no great effect, and undermines the central theme of the transforming power of love that Siegfried finds when he falls for Odette, a princess condemned by an evil owl man to live as a swan. In Scarlett’s version, owl man Rothbart is also undermining Siegfried at court because he wants to take over the kingdom. In a much-altered ending – spoiler alert – Odette dies but Siegfried lives. But he never wanted power; the whole point of Swan Lake is that he is prepared to sacrifice everything for an ideal of passion. Making it into a political drama destroys its metaphorical impact. Which leaves you with the dancing. In the first of many exciting casts, Yasmine Naghdi stepped in at short notice for Marianela Núñez. Naghdi is a wonderful technician, with every step, each inclination of the head and position of the arms placed perfectly. But she is also extraordinarily self-contained; I long for her to be less perfect and more vulnerable, less efficient and more poetic. As Siegfried, Muntagirov was heavenly: expressive, solicitous, and flying across the stage in long, aching lines. It looks very handsome too, with John Macfarlane’s sumptuous sets conjuring an imperial court and a bleak lake. In this, Swan Lake shares qualities in common with Mark Bruce’s new piece Phantoms, part of a company triple bill, designed by Phil Eddolls to look like a barren desert and lit to perfection by Guy Hoare. This balletic road movie, for which Bruce provides choreography and music, is full of drama – a racing wolf, a moving car, a full moon – but light on dance. I found its sequences of strange events wore thin quite quickly. Bruce has such divine dancers – Eleanor Duval, Jonathan Goddard, Christopher Thomas, Bryony Harrison and Carina Howard – that I just want to see them in action. For this reason, I adored the other new work, the 20-minute Folk Tales, to traditional music arranged and performed by Martin Simpson, which tells its hauntingly odd stories in riveting, descriptive movement. The older work, Green Apples, to the music of the White Stripes, pulls off the same feat. It’s a programme of two halves and I more enjoyed the first.

3/6/2022,"The Weather Station’s last album, Ignorance (2021), was a masterpiece. A set of lush pop songs about climate grief and lost innocence, it paired Tamara Lindeman’s sophisticated songcraft with a bold, outgoing sound palette. How Is It … is a parallel work of voice, piano and barely-there, often improvised orchestrations recorded with different musicians; songs too intimate and delicate to fit the Ignorance tracklisting – although you can hear the similarities between songs such as Sway and Ignorance’s I Tried to Tell You. Recorded over three days in early March 2020, songs such as Endless Time boggle quietly at first world comfort and entitlement, hitting the acetate just as Covid upended reality. Lindeman catalogues the things we will soon recall taking for granted, such as buying “champagne grapes, strawberries and lilies in November rain”, and the presumptuousness of explorers who miscatalogued indigenous fauna according to too-narrow taxonomies – the terrible “ignorance” of the last album’s title. These songs about love and existential sorrow feel purposely airy and unanchored – there’s no percussion – mirroring the psychological freefall of recent times. Ironically, though, they firm up the parallels between Lindeman and fellow complex Canadian, Joni Mitchell.",Arts/Music,The Weather Station: How Is It That I Should Look at the Stars review – delicate songs of love and sorrow,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/06/the-weather-station-how-is-it-that-i-should-look-at-the-stars-review-tamara-lindeman
3/6/2022,"Vanessa Bowman paints the world around her: the 19th-century village church, her back garden, the leaves on the trees in the fields where she walks her dog. Once she has chosen a scene from her rural Dorset idyll, she puts brush to canvas, sometimes poring over the details for days in her studio. Over three decades she has honed a unique style and earned a loyal fanbase, with 20,000 followers on Instagram and commissions from House & Garden, Prince Charles’s Highgrove shop and Farrow & Ball. But when she received an email from a fan in Canada, asking whether she was collaborating with online fashion firm Shein, she was baffled. The £17 jumper in the image attached to the email had a picture printed on it that was unmistakably hers. But Bowman had not partnered with the multibillion dollar Chinese clothing behemoth. Instead, she alleges it plastered her picture on its product without ever getting in touch. “They didn’t remotely bother trying to change anything,” she said. “The things I paint are my garden and my little village: it’s my life. And they’ve just taken my world to China and whacked it on an acrylic jumper.” While copyright infringement is far from new, Bowman’s experience is part of a wider trend. The oil painter, 51, is the latest member of a fast-growing club of artists and designers who claim their work has been stolen by Shein. Launched in Nanjing in 2008, and based in Singapore, the world’s biggest online fashion firm has a murky ethical track record, including on the environment and workers’ rights. But despite its reputation, it has thrived, gaining almost cult-like status among teenage fans drawn to its constantly updated product range and ultra-low prices. On TikTok alone, videos showing customers unpacking orders with dozens of items, labelled with the hashtag #SheinHaul, have racked up more than 4.5 billion views. As its customer base has grown, so too has the list of alleged copyright breaches. Dozens of people have posted about their designs being stolen online, sometimes using the slogan #ShameOnShein. One illustrator, who claimed to have their skeleton artwork lifted, tweeted: “Shein stole my art and slapped it on a phone case, not sure if I should be flattered or mad.” Another UK-based artist said she had spent “hours creating new and fresh designs” and felt “a little bit of a sick feeling” when a fan told her that her frog artwork had been used on stickers sold on Shein. “I really don’t want to be associated with them at all,” she wrote. Some companies who claim to have had their designs copied have taken legal action, including Dr Martens and Levi Strauss. But, for many independent designers and artists, the time and energy involved with pursuing a complaint is too great to face. Aside from posting on social media, Bowman thought her chance of success was so slim it was not worth spending more time agonising over. “I was really angry that somebody could just take something I’ve worked so hard to produce. They obviously don’t care,” she said. “But all I want to do is paint in my studio; I don’t want to get involved with lawyers and could feel myself getting really stressed. It was a bit David and Goliath and I was completely overwhelmed.” For those who do choose to take on the firm, it can often be a losing battle. Elora Pautrat, 26, an illustrator and digital artist based in Edinburgh, sent a stern email to Shein after a fan messaged her on Instagram to tell her one of her ethereal purple cityscapes was being used on a mousemat. “They didn’t have my authorisation and never asked me anything,” she said. At first she didn’t receive a reply. But when she posted her complaint on social media, Shein – a rival to Asos, Boohoo and PrettyLittleThing – wrote back and apologised. After an exchange, Pautrat was paid some money from the sales of the product and promised it would never happen again. But since that first incident, in 2020, she claims the company has lifted her work on about 10 further occasions and used it on products including stickers and prints. Each time, she patiently writes to the copyright infringement team and calls them out on social media. But a few months later, it happens again. “It’s frustrating because they do have power and resources to make proper collaborations with artists and still make a lot of money out of it,” said Pautrat, who says the latest alleged violation was in January. “But they just keep stealing for some reason, which just isn’t fair.” William Miles, an intellectual property lawyer and partner at Briffa, a specialist art law firm, said the problem of designs being lifted was becoming “ever more prevalent” in the fast fashion sector. His firm is seeing two or three infringement cases per month. “The fundamental issue, I think, is that fashion companies are under pressure to produce large volumes of new and fashionable goods, so their designers often go for the quick fix,” he said. “A change that has happened is that these things often aren’t dealt with by the court: they’re dealt with by the court of public opinion,” he added. “The person puts side-by-side pictures on social media, everyone gets really angry, and it looks bad for the fast fashion label. But some seem to have slightly thicker skin than others.” The Artists’ Union, which represents more than 500 members in England, called for regulatory action to hold repeat offenders to account. Zita Holbourne, the organisation’s national chair, said it was “constantly representing artists in these kinds of cases. This is about companies trying to exploit art for their own benefit and profit without a thought for the rights of those artists. They need to be exposed, challenged and named and shamed,” she said. Shein said it “respects designers and artists, and the intellectual property rights of others”, and takes “all claims of infringement seriously”. “When legitimate complaints are raised by valid IP rights holders, Shein promptly addresses the situation,” it said. It added that suppliers were required to certify that their products did not infringe the intellectual property of third parties, with “appropriate action” taken when “non-compliance is found”.",Arts/Art and design,‘They took my world’: fashion giant Shein accused of art theft,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/06/they-took-my-world-fashion-giant-shein-accused-of-art-theft
3/6/2022,"‘War comes very early to the theatre,” said the Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg. “Then he stands around waiting in the wings.” This time too. For a few years, there has been something, somebody, moving in the shadow of the stage curtain. Only a few people felt they recognised it. But language noticed. Even 10 years ago, big-power war in Europe was “unthinkable these days. Do try and keep up!” Then, somehow, it became “well, in theory, but just utterly unlikely”. So, thinkable again. Hard to say when that mental border was crossed; perhaps after the Yugoslav wars, perhaps in 2014 when Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea and sponsored proxy war in the Donbas region. And now they ask: “What sort of European war is this going to be? And how nuclear? And where will the next one start?” History doesn’t repeat itself. It just tries to remember an old song it heard once. It may be that Putin’s 24 February 2022 will turn out to be like Hitler’s 22 June 1941 – the day he invaded Russia, doomed himself and Germany to destruction and made inevitable a divided Europe whose Cold War and barbed wire would last for half a century. But Putin isn’t Hitler. He will die a disappointed old nuisance in exile somewhere, rather than by Heldentod suicide in his bunker. Both men qualify as psychopathic dictators, swaddled from reality in fantasies of geopolitical revenge. But Putin’s grip on the Russian imagination is weaker than Hitler’s on the Germans. And his use of police terror against his own people, though horrifying, is distinctly less effective. All the same, that wise historian Margaret MacMillan sees one desperately important parallel. Both men have meant what they said. And in both cases they were not taken seriously until it was too late. Hitler raved on in public about getting rid of the Jews and conquering Lebensraum in eastern Europe. But the “other Hitler”, in private, could sometimes talk quite charmingly and constructively about possible agreements. Obviously, foreign visitors concluded, the public stuff was just for show while the “serious” Hitler was revealing his real mind. Diametrically wrong! The crazy speeches gave his true intentions; the sober reflections over coffee were all lies. With Putin, the west wrote off his increasingly wild talk about breaking Nato’s encirclement and restoring Russia’s dominion over post-Soviet space. He couldn’t be serious. Under the bluster, wasn’t there still that shrewd, cautious Putin with whom one could do business? But Ukraine proves the opposite. The imperial dream is what he means. The meetings with western leaders across that long table, hinting at terms for a bargain, were all fake. At the moment of writing, Putin’s plan seems to have two stages. First, military victory, achieved mainly by isolating resistance in a few cities and then shelling them to blackened husks, as the Russians did to Grozny in Chechnya. Armed resistance might continue, especially in the hills and forests of western Ukraine. But Putin may recall how Stalin fought Ukrainian nationalist guerrillas for years after the Second World War, without letting those murderous repressions distract the Soviet Union as a whole. Next, regime change. That’s unlikely to mean some temporary junta to supervise complete abolition of Ukrainian independence and annexation by Russia. More probably, it means the installation of a puppet government in Kyiv, to run a cut-down, smaller Ukrainian protectorate pledged to support Russian foreign and defence policies. Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Ukraine’s legal government are already targets. Russian special forces may try to kidnap the president, stuffing syringes into him and flying him to some Russian “psychiatric clinic”. Just possibly, he might not survive “an attempted escape”. In August 1968, Alexander Dubček and his colleagues in Prague were kidnapped and flown to Moscow. But that case was easier. Dubček was held guilty of anti-socialist policy – “socialism with a human face” – rather than of defending the sovereignty of Czechoslovakia. Zelenskiy stands simply for the full freedom and independence of his country. For a Russian mind like Putin’s, that is much harder to forgive. But finding cadres to form that puppet government will unfortunately not be hard. Since independence in 1991, Ukrainian politics have been poisoned by fewer than a dozen billionaire oligarchs and their paid henchmen in the Rada (parliament). Some have even led governments. Most of them, not quite all, are at once corrupt and treacherous. They hold investments and property in both Ukraine and Russia and when in trouble they take cover in Moscow. Given enough bodyguard protection, and assisted by pro-Russian figures imported from th Donbas, such men would willingly slink into government in Kyiv. And here history is indeed trying to remember an old song: Moscow’s obsessive wish to paralyse and subjugate the space between Russia and western Europe. A wish that didn’t begin with Putin, or with Stalin’s ring of satellites, but 300 years ago with Peter the Great and later, above all, with the Empress Catherine. Back then, the space was filled by the old Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, including most of western Ukraine. For many years, threats, intrigues and Russian infantry kept the country submissive. But then Poland rebelled, reclaiming its independence. In 1792, Catherine sent the Russian armies in, supported by a clutch of wealthy pro-Russian magnates in the Confederation of Targowica. They tried to govern. But a huge uprising followed and in 1795 Catherine, with Austria and Prussia, wiped Poland off the map for over a century. Now Ukraine may face its own Targowica. But just as the great partition crime concentrated a new, militant confidence in Polish identity, it looks as if the invasion of 2022 is completing Ukraine’s transition from early self-doubt to a solid faith in Ukraine as an authentic national community. Europe itself, woken by explosions, stumbles out into a different landscape. When we fell asleep, no longer required for Cold War sentry duty, the red lines were faded and in places scuffed away. The tripwires of military pacts hung slack and rusty. Now, suddenly, the world is very dangerous again. And the real danger is not primarily mad dictators attacking their neighbours. It is uncertainty. It is not being sure what will happen, what will be triggered, if somebody marches over the half-scuffed-away line or pushes through the sagging wire. It’s said that the First World War began because there were too many treaties tangled across Europe. The truth, perhaps, is that there were not enough treaties, none unambiguously laying down who would go to war with whom over what. We have to repaint that red line, replace and tauten the tripwire. If Nato governments have private reservations about Article 5 – mutual assistance by all if one is attacked – we are doomed. Die for Estonia? Yes, we must be prepared to die for Estonia and the world must be sure that we are. We know now that Putin “means it”. Do we mean it? In the future, post-Putin, we will need to court Russia into partnership. Perhaps into Mikhail Gorbachev’s dream of a “common European home”, in which all are members of a single defence pact. But that means recognising that not all Russia’s historical grievances are propaganda. At the 1990 Berlin meeting, the Soviet side left believing that it had a statement that Nato would not extend up to its borders – in return for Soviet acceptance that the whole of a united Germany could join the pact. But later the west said that there was never any statement and brought Poland and the other post-communist states into Nato. Jacques Faure, once French ambassador in Kyiv, says carefully: “That is not to say that … there were no such statements. But we don’t know, because there are no records or written documents.” Putin’s claim that Nato plans to encircle and strangle Russia is absurd. But many Russians, not just the Kremlin crew, believe that their country was swindled in its hour of weakness. It’s an abscess that needs treatment. Russians and Ukrainians will also have to find their way back together. These are two densely interlaced peoples, who have no business killing each other. A few years ago, I was taken to a graveyard in rural New Jersey, where Will Leslie, a young Scot in the British army, was buried after the battle of Princeton in 1777. Benjamin Rush, the American revolutionary who found his body, had been Will’s best friend; he had lodged for years with the Leslie family in Edinburgh while the two boys attended the university there together. Rush fell in love with Will’s sister, but she was too young for marriage and he had to return to America. When the war of independence came, the two found themselves on opposite sides. After Princeton, Benjamin went looking for Will and discovered him in a cart, where he had died of wounds. He persuaded General Washington to give him a full military funeral, and sat down to write a heartbroken letter to the Leslies in Edinburgh. Scots and Americans were no further apart in 1777 than Ukrainians and Russians are today. Somewhere among the ruins, a silent Serhii is looking down on a dead Vadim, who once shared home and college and friends with him in St Petersburg. This conflict has the special horror of civil war between brothers. But by the time we say “Never again!”, it is always too late.

3/6/2022,"About 20 women a day are diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the UK. Their condition is often well advanced before it is detected, making their tumours difficult to treat. But if Belfast researcher Shannon Beattie is successful, it may be possible in the near future to make detections of ovarian cancer much more speedily and more accurately than today. “Earlier detection of ovarian cancer would make a crucial difference in treating the disease,” said Beattie, the chief operating officer of GenoME Diagnostics, a spin-out company from Queen’s University Belfast. “It would allow doctors to treat tumours when they are small and have not spread to other parts of the body. That makes it much easier to eradicate them.” And the project is about to be boosted with a £50,000 award that is to be given to Beattie as part of the celebrations marking International Women’s Day on Tuesday. She is one of 39 British female entrepreneurs who have won Innovate UK’s Women in Innovation awards, which will be announced on that date. GenoME Diagnostics’ project has involved isolating a number of biomarkers that can potentially be detected in a patient’s blood. If a woman is found to be carrying a particular set of these biomarkers, this could indicate if she is in the early stages of ovarian cancer, said Beattie. “At present, most cases of ovarian cancer are not spotted until a woman has reached the later stages of the disease. In stage three, there is roughly a 20% chance of survival, while for stage four, it is even less. So there is clearly an urgent need to develop more effective tests.” The system being developed by Beattie and her colleagues at GenoME Diagnostics is focused on detecting one of the worst, most aggressive subtypes of ovarian cancer, a condition known as high-grade serous carcinoma, which accounts for about 70% of cases. Armed with the biomarkers that have been identified and patented by her company, Beattie and her team are now analysing how effective these are at detecting – in early stages – those affected by high-grade serous carcinoma. Once this has been established, the aim will then be to find out if these biomarkers – which can be pinpointed using a simple blood test, it is hoped – are effective in detecting all ovarian cancers at early stages. “It is not just early detection that we are developing,” Beattie added. “Current tests also trigger many false positives and that causes a lot of stress for women who are told, incorrectly, that they may have ovarian cancer, only to discover much later that they are actually unaffected by the condition.” Other projects to be given prizes this week at the Women in Innovation awards will include a type of brain implant that can treat glioblastoma, the most common form of primary brain cancer in adults; a revolutionary wearable technology for athletes that provides key data to help reduce injuries and improve recovery times; and a scheme to make artificial leather from garden waste. The 39 female entrepreneurs, who come from all nations and regions of the UK, will each be awarded £50,000 to help them scale up their ideas and get them into production. The awards are now in their fourth year and are open to female founders, co-founders or senior decision-makers working in businesses that have been operating for at least a year.",News/Society,"Belfast researcher wins £50,000 prize to aid early detection of ovarian cancer",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/06/belfast-researcher-wins-50000-prize-to-aid-early-detection-of-ovarian-cancer
