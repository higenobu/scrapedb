3/30/2022,"A four-year-old girl who spent the first year of her life in hospital after being born four months premature has been named the honorary 41st runner in this year’s Grand National. Betty Batt spent 13 months undergoing emergency surgery, blood transfusions and critical care after being born weighing only 650g (1.5lb). Her name will now appear alongside 40 horses taking part in the world’s premier steeplechase. “She is our little miracle,” Betty’s father, Phil Batt, said. “No matter what comes we will all continue to love her with everything we have and with utter joy and immense gratitude to those who never gave up on her and gave us this most precious gift.” Betty, who was as tall as a ballpoint pen when she was born in 2017, was swiftly placed in intensive care at Liverpool Women’s hospital. After doctors discovered two bowel perforations, she was transferred to Alder Hey hospital for emergency surgery, where a dedicated team catered to Betty’s medical needs. She returned to her Warrington home, siblings and parents months later. She was described by nurses as bringing out “the best in people”. The 41st honorary runner title was created by the Jockey Club in 2017 to raise awareness and funds for an individual or cause. The Jockey Club, which runs the Aintree racecourse, nominated Betty to help raise funds for the children’s hospital. Since its inception, the title has had four recipients, including 19-year-old Lydia Barker, who struggled with obsessive compulsive disorder, and the Alder Hey children’s charity in 2019. Dickon White, the Jockey Club’s regional director for Aintree racecourse and the north-west, said the work at Alder Hey deserved worldwide recognition. “By highlighting the Batt family’s story and promoting the work Alder Hey do for children and young people day in, day out we hope to raise awareness and much needed funds to help other youngsters and their families,” he said. The Grand National is one of the country’s biggest sporting events, drawing millions of viewers since its founding in the 19th century by a Liverpool hotelier. Last year the jockey Rachael Blackmore became the first woman to win the Grand National title. It was cancelled in 2020 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic – and a virtual race took place instead. This year’s race takes place at Aintree on Saturday 9 April.",News/Society,Betty Batt named honorary 41st runner in Grand National,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/29/betty-batt-named-honorary-41st-runner-in-grand-national

3/30/2022,"Dracoa the ferret and the ginger cat named Cat have reached an uneasy truce. And while the dog across the platform still yaps at them both, after more than a month, the humans and their pets living in this corner of Kharkiv’s metro station are used to each other. On one side of the platform, Tetiana Kapustynska hung up balloons for her 24th birthday on the pillar she sleeps behind. “The day before I cried because I didn’t know what it was going to be like, but in the end people got together and celebrated with me,” she said. “The biggest problem was champagne, I couldn’t find a bottle anywhere,” she added with a grin, as she made cups of instant coffee for visitors with water in a flask. “Cake wasn’t so much of a problem. You can still get it in the shops.” Kapustynska, who is a maths and physics teacher, turned the metro station’s operation room into a cross between a childcare facility and a school for the children living in the underground chamber. For her birthday, they made decorations and organised flowers. Barely a month ago, she had been trying to choose a bar or restaurant for celebrations. But since the war began, bombs, shells and rockets have smashed Kharkiv city centre and residential areas, killing hundreds of civilians, in perhaps the most intense offensives of the war outside the besieged port town of Mariupol. In response, life has largely moved indoors and underground, with thousands of people taking refuge in Soviet-era stations. These were designed in the cold war era to shelter the city’s residents from a western attack, but now the bunkers are protecting civilians from the Russians. “I don’t go out much; it’s frightening,” said Denis Kapustynskyi, 19, Tetania’s brother. He lived with his mother in Saltivka, a northern suburb that has been turned into a burnt-out wasteland by some of the most intense shelling of the war. He does not even know if they have a house any more, after fleeing with little more than the clothes on their backs at the start of the war. “On the first day of the war, the sounds of explosions were really loud. They were already shelling housing blocks. We got dressed, picked up our documents and left,” he said. Some still risk venturing out in the daytime for light, fresh air, shopping, and Tetiana goes to feed and play with her dog, who is too big to be brought into the metro station – although every trip above ground is potentially deadly. Last Thursday, a rocket strike in the north of the city hit a group of people queueing for food. One of the dead was a woman living in the metro, who had gone above ground for a short break. Vast metal doors swing shut every evening at 6pm, when curfew silences the streets above and seals those inside into relative safety, although they say the reverberations of the biggest bombs still cut through the layers of concrete and metal. After several weeks of war, the refugees have formed a kind of subterranean village, whose residents try to support each other through the tensions of communal life. There is a constant supply of boiled water for tea, coffee and noodles, and sometimes volunteers bring cooked meals to the station, stews or soups that can be easily eaten. Kapustynska’s school keeps the children distracted from the bombings. Exercise and supplies come from daily treks through the vast network of tunnels; the trains have stopped running, and now the only vehicles that come trundling down the tracks are hand-pulled carts, loaded with water and food. “We go walking through the tunnels to collect humanitarian aid,” said Dracoa’s owner, Dascha Tyrinova, 34, who worked in an electronics shop until the war upended her life. “When I heard the fighter jets overhead, I decided to come here.” Her neighbourhood, just over a kilometre away, has been badly hit. Kharkiv’s mostly Russian-speaking residents believe civilians are being punished by a Russian army furious its soldiers were not welcomed as liberators. “My apartment has suffered, part of the block was completely demolished, there was shrapnel damage and a fire started, neighbours told me. I haven’t been back to check, it’s too frightening.” Now she spends most of her days and nights on the double mattress that is her new home, playing with her ferret, keeping a watchful eye on children who come to admire him, or reading an ebook. It felt safe for women despite the large numbers of people on the platform, because there were police in the station, and even at night the lights stayed on, she said. Tyrinova’s job stopped when the war closed her shop. But many of the younger people on the platform are still trying to work or study despite the stress and chaos, helped a little in their preparations for this traumatic new life by the isolation of Covid. “I’m still doing my job, though it’s a bit hard to focus,” said Julia Miroshrichenko, 25, an IT consultant who has moved into the station with her flatmate, Ksenia Zhytnyk, also 25, and Cat the ginger cat. A few people who were living on the platform have returned to their homes, deciding the risk was preferable to the strains of communal life, and some have left the city entirely. Overland trains are still running west, and there is a road open out of the city, if you can find a car. The flatmates say they are determined to stay. They have already been displaced once by Russian forces, when their homes in the east were seized by Moscow-backed forces in 2014, who set up self-proclaimed separatist republics. “It’s OK here. We made friends with a lot of people, and the cat is fine. I’m reading a lot of news and waiting for the situation to get better,” said Zhytnyk, who still goes home for showers and to pick up cat food. “I don’t want to move again, I already moved once,” she said. “Others are scared, but we are used to war, to the sounds of bombing.”",News/World news,"With cats, ferrets and handcarts, life goes on underground in Kharkiv",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/kharkiv-ukraine-underground-refuge-life
3/30/2022,"Sony is preparing to launch a PlayStation competitor to Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass, kick-starting a race between the console firms to establish a Netflix-style service for gaming. The service will offer a wide selection of titles for a low monthly subscription and build on Sony’s long-running PlayStation Plus model, which offers members two free games a month and access to online multiplayer options for £49.99 a year. Later this year Sony will rebrand that service PS+ Essentials and add two more expensive tiers, Extra and Premium. The former will add “up to 400 of the most enjoyable PS4 and PS5 games – including blockbuster hits from our PlayStation Studios catalogue and third-party partners” for £83.99 a year. The latter will include a video game streaming service that includes titles from previous PlayStation generations for £99.99 a year. The top tier is comparable to Microsoft’s Game Pass, which starts at £10.99 a month. Both services offer downloadable and streaming games from the past 20 years. However, Sony claims to offer more titles, dating to the first PlayStation. “The new Extra and Premium tiers represent a major evolution for PlayStation Plus,” Sony said. “With these tiers, our key focus is to ensure the hundreds of games we offer will include the best-quality content that sets us apart. At launch, we plan to include titles such as Death Stranding, God of War, Marvel’s Spider-Man, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Mortal Kombat 11, and Returnal.” The service will launch in several Asian markets in June before expanding to most of the rest of the world. Despite the companies launching new home consoles in 2020, they have avoided the open competition of previous generations. Sony pushed the PlayStation 5 with a focus on exclusive titles, while Microsoft committed to making new games playable on its Xbox Series X console as well as the older Xbox One. Instead, the American company built up its Game Pass offering, which gives users access to more than 100 games for £10.99. While Sony claims its rival to Game Pass will include more games, Microsoft is still unique in promising subscribers that every new game the company makes will be included in its subscription package on the day of release. Instead, the Sony chief executive, Jim Ryan, says the company will still launch its biggest titles as standalone purchases. Speaking to the industry site GamesIndustry.biz, Ryan said: “We feel if we were to do that with the games that we make at PlayStation Studios, that virtuous cycle will be broken. “The level of investment that we need to make in our studios would not be possible, and we think the knock-on effect on the quality of the games that we make would not be something that gamers want.” Game Pass and PlayStation Plus include game streaming as part of their packages, letting subscribers play via remote servers, rather than having to download games to a home console. The technology has been adopted by Amazon and Google as they attempt to enter the market with their Stadia and Luna services respectively, with mixed success. Last year Google closed its in-house game development studio and is attempting to pivot Stadia to provide white-label support for other gaming companies.",News/Technology,Sony to launch PlayStation rival to Xbox Game Pass,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/29/sony-launch-playstation-rival-xbox-game-pass
3/30/2022,"Strung out in the icy reaches of our solar system, two peaks that tower over the surface of the dwarf planet Pluto have perplexed planetary scientists for years. Some speculated it could be an ice volcano, spewing out not lava but vast quantities of icy slush – yet no cauldron-like caldera could be seen. Now a full analysis of images and topographical data suggests it is not one ice volcano but a merger of many – some up to 7,000 metres tall and about 10-150km across. Their discovery has reignited another debate: what could be keeping Pluto warm enough to support volcanic activity? Sitting at the southern edge of a vast heart-shaped ice sheet, these unusual surface features were initially spotted when Nasa’s New Horizons spacecraft flew past in July 2015, providing the first close-up images of the icy former planet and its moons. “We were instantly intrigued by this area because it was so different and striking-looking,” said Dr Kelsi Singer, a New Horizons co-investigator and deputy project scientist at Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. “There are these giant broad mounds, and then this hummocky-like, undulating texture superimposed on top; and even on top of that there’s a smaller bouldery kind of texture.” At the time, an ice volcano seemed like the least-weird explanation for these features – there were no impact craters from asteroids or meteors nearby, suggesting these features had been erased by relatively recent geological events; and no evidence of plate tectonics – a key contributor to mountain formation on Earth. Yet, Singer and her colleagues were cautious about calling them volcanoes: “It’s considered kind of a big claim to have icy volcanism,” she said. “It’s theoretically possible, but there aren’t a tonne of other examples in the solar system, and they are all really different looking, and do not look like the features on Pluto.” Since those first images were beamed back in 2015, many more have arrived, along with compositional and topographical data. Taking all of this together, the team has concluded that these unusual features really are volcanoes – although their appearance and behaviour is very different to those found on Earth. “If you look at Mount Fuji from a distance or one of the Hawaiian volcanoes, they look like these big, broad, smooth features, which is just not what we see there,” said Singer, whose findings are published in Nature Communications. “So, we think, probably the material is extruded from below, and the dome grows on top.” As for the nature of this material, the compositional data suggests it is mainly water ice, but with some additional “antifreeze” components mixed in, such as ammonia, or methanol. “It is still difficult to think that it would be liquid, because it’s just too cold – the average surface temperature on Pluto is about 40 Kelvin (-233 C),” said Singer. “So, it’s probably more, either slushy material, or it could even be mostly solid state – like a glacier is solid, but it can still flow.” Even this is quite surprising, she added, because, given the extremely low temperature, this material shouldn’t be mobile at all. Possibly, it suggests Pluto’s rocky core is warmer than anticipated, and that heat energy released from the radioactive decay some of its elements is being somehow becoming trapped, for example by an insulating layer of material, and periodically released, triggering volcanic eruptions. All of this is speculation. “I will freely admit we do not have a lot of information about what’s going on in the subsurface of Pluto,” said Singer. “But this is forcing people to come up with some creative ideas for how [ice volcanism] could happen.” Whatever the explanation, the old idea of Pluto as just an inert ball of ice is looking increasingly improbable.",News/Science,"Pluto’s peaks are ice volcanoes, scientists conclude ",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/29/plutos-peaks-are-ice-volcanoes-scientists-conclude
3/30/2022,"A 20-year-old university rugby player has died a fortnight after being injured during a match. Friends and teammates paid tribute to Maddy Lawrence as a bubbly, talented young woman who loved the game. She died on 25 March after suffering an injury while playing for UWE Bristol women’s second team against the University of Bristol’s women’s second team. A spokesperson for her university said: “Everyone in the UWE Bristol community is profoundly shocked and saddened by the death of our student and talented UWE women’s rugby player Maddy Lawrence. “We would like to pass on our deepest condolences and sympathies to Maddy’s family, friends and teammates at this very difficult time. “Fellow students, university staff and members of the UWE Bristol sporting community affected by this tragic news can access a full range of university support services offered by our wellbeing service or can contact the Samaritans helpline.” Tom Monks, the head of UWE Women’s rugby union, said: “Maddy was an absolute pleasure to coach. She wanted to learn and appreciated every playing opportunity that her dedication warranted. The unity and togetherness of this year’s squad is the strongest I’ve ever felt in my 20 years of coaching and Maddy’s beaming smile and warmth embodied the incredible bond we have.” On Instagram, the club referred to her as “Maddy ‘Twinkle toes’ Lawrence and said: “She proudly represented our club both on and off the rugby pitch, growing into the sport and our rugby family. Maddy was a bubbly girl who was so fun to be around. Whenever she smiled and laughed you couldn’t help but smile and laugh with her. That was the sort of player, friend, sister and daughter Maddy was.” The club will retire the No 11 shirt she played as a mark of respect. The club had billed the match with Bristol as a “big rivalry game” before them match and said there was a “lovely mix of abilities” and that for some players it was their first game. It is understood Lawrence was hurt in a tackle. Women’s clubs across the country were expected to mark Lawrence’s death.

Yes sir, a great way of filling space and passing time when nothing was happening and they had no content. The Fiver, tall and tan and young and lovely, has no such luxury to fall back on when the going gets tough, and so on quiet days like these we just have to brazen it out. There are some friendlies on Tuesday night involving England, Wales, Norn Iron, Scotland and the Republic O’Ireland, it’s true, but even by tail-end-of-international-break standards, they’re all non-events of the very lowest stripe. John Stones has gone back home, Gareth Bale is putting his feet up again, 68-year-old Steven Davis hopes to build up his fitness after knack, Andy Robertson has recovered from Covid, Séamus Coleman will most likely be rested, and when she passes he smiles but she doesn’t see. Just as The Fiver was about to bundle Granny Fiver into a photo booth with a packet of chalk, a blackboard and Bubbles the Clown, with explicit instructions to give that eerie little sod a good thrashing at noughts and crosses, we suddenly remembered that Portugal host North Macedonia to play off for a place in Qatar. With João Cancelo back from suspension, Diogo Jota in form, and Cristiano Ronaldo asking for “hell breaking loose” in the stadium, this looks a shoo-in for the Portuguese. However, tell that to Italy, and indeed Germany who were also beaten at home by Bobi Milevski’s side during qualifying. Should the Macedonians spring yet another shock, they’ll appear at a World Cup finals for the first time ever, and The Fiver will have something to say on Wednesday.

3/30/2022,"The widow of man killed by a neighbour has described watching her husband being stabbed to death as if he were an “animal” and told a court the attacker smiled and lit a cigarette in apparent triumph as his victim lay dying on their front lawn. Sarah Boorman said the killer, Can Arslan, had repeatedly threatened to murder her, her husband, Matthew Boorman, and their children, telling them he would only serve 10 years in prison if he did so. Bristol crown court has heard there was a long-running dispute between Arslan, 52, and neighbours in the Gloucestershire village of Walton Cardiff, near Tewkesbury, with small rows over parking and a scratch to a car escalating to the point where Arslan faced eviction. The court has heard there is no dispute that Arslan killed Boorman, a 43-year-old contract manager and father-of-three, who was stabbed 27 times, but the jury has been told it must decide if it was murder or manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Jurors watched a video of a police interview with Sarah Boorman in which she said she saw her husband pull up in front of their house after work on the afternoon of 5 October last year and watched as Arslan approached him and attacked him. “I heard Matthew shout: ‘Fuck off!’” she said. She went outside and tried to pull Arslan off her husband. “I didn’t see a blade, I didn’t know he [Boorman] had been stabbed. Then I saw blood and saw him stab Matthew in the side of his face. Then he stabbed him in his stomach. I tried to pull him off again, then he continued to just stab Matthew like he was an animal on the floor.” Demonstrating the stabbing motions, she said: “He stabbed Matthew like he was nothing.” Sarah Boorman suffered a knife wound to her thigh. She said Arslan was much stockier than her husband. Sobbing, she continued: “I wish I had hit him with something or thrown something to distract him … Mr Arslan treated him like he was a piece of meat; he sat on top of him and he lit a cigarette as if he was triumphant. Then he threw the cigarette on the floor and got up casually and walked around to the front garden as Matthew lay dying on the floor.” One of their children, who had seen the attack and heard the screaming, ran upstairs. “Arslan was prowling around the front garden, I was scared he was going to come back and attack Matthew some more,” she said. Helped by neighbours Sarah Boorman carried her husband inside. She said the ambulance and police “took forever” to come. “I wanted him to survive and live,” she said. Sarah Boorman said she saw other neighbours brandishing planks of wood and golf clubs trying to get Arslan to drop the knife. “He was enjoying it; it felt like he loved the attention.” She said she had long feared that he would attack them. “He’s always said he was going to murder us and rape me.” She said Arslan would laugh and say he would only get 10 years if he did. She said Arslan would film the children’s bedrooms and tell her and her husband he knew where they worked. She said he told them he was a “Turkish fighter” and had killed before. Sarah Boorman said Arslan had first threatened to murder them in February 2021 and “ran” after a civil injunction was issued against him in June 2021. She saw him for the first time again three days before the attack. The court was told that Boorman’s work colleagues heard the attack because he was on a conference call at the time. Arslan denies murder.
