1/11/2022,"Aspen is notoriously expensive, especially when it comes to the local housing market. In need of more employee housing, ski company Aspen Snowmass made its own tiny-house village. The 6-acre village, built on a campground, can house 120 people and has plans to double in size. Aspen, Colorado and affordability are practically antonyms. It's the most expensive ski town in the US when it comes to real estate, according to a 2021 report from Engel & Völkers, a global real estate company. Traveling here is expensive, too. The average visitor spends nearly $300 on nightly accommodations and $200 on ski-lift tickets, according to HomeToGo. Aspen's high price point — and the accompanying reputation — is what attracts the country's richest to buy million-dollar mansions and spend their winters on the slopes. But the lack of affordability doesn't just impact vacationers, it affects the people who keep the town running, operating ski lifts, pouring cocktails, selling designer clothes, and working at hotel concierge desks. As a result, one of the town's biggest pain points is a lack of affordable housing. ""Housing is scarce and expensive,"" according to Pitkin County's website, the county where Aspen is located. When the issue trickled down to Aspen Snowmass, the town's largest employer and name behind four ski areas, the company found a solution in tiny homes. In 2016, Aspen Snowmass placed six 500-square-foot tiny homes in the Aspen-Basalt Campground. The pilot program was such a success, there are 40 tiny houses today with plans for more. When Blake Sims was hired for the winter season at Aspen Snowmass, he told Insider that finding a cheap place to live was the only way he could take the job. ""With the salary we get, living here is not doable,"" the ski-lift operator at Buttermilk said. It's a familiar challenge for ski companies. One way Aspen Snowmass entices low-wage workers is with housing assistance, said Philip Jeffreys, a planning and development project manager for Aspen Snowmass. Aspen Snowmass has a portfolio of properties that are leased to workers, priced below the region's market value, according to its websites. Each season, departments at Aspen Snowmass, like hospitality or ski lifts, are allotted a certain number of beds, Jeffreys said. From there, each department chooses how to use them, whether for new hires or returning workers. When Sims was hired to work the ski lifts, he was given four options: two shared apartments, a room in a tiny house, or to find his own housing. The last wasn't viable, ""unless I wanted to live out of my car,"" he said. Sims picked the tiny house, which was the cheapest choice. For $550 a month — between $100 and $200 less than the other options — Sims said he would have his own bedroom and be about an hour bus ride to his job. In 2008, Aspen Snowmass bought the Aspen-Basalt Campground for potential worker housing, according to the Aspen Times. One option was to rezone the 6.6-acre lot, but that would be timely and expensive, Jeffreys said. So he turned to tiny homes. In 2016, the company bought six 500-square-foot homes for $100,000 each. Technically RVs since they sit on wheels, they have license plates and traditional RV hookups for utilities and house two people. ""It's been really successful,"" Jeffreys said. For Aspen Snowmass, the village cost less than it would to rezone and build an apartment complex. In 2017, Aspen Snowmass bought 34 more tiny homes. Each cost about the same and could house three people, he said. What was once a campground became a tiny-house village for 120 workers. While tiny homes helped alleviate some of Aspen Snowmass' need for housing, it's still not enough. The ski company continues to face a shortage, according to the Aspen Times. This year, Aspen Snowmass rented out a hotel in Glenwood Springs for additional housing. ""It is a scarce resource,"" Jeffreys said. ""Even though we have over 1,000 beds in our portfolio, that's only about a quarter of our workforce."" Jeffreys said there are plans to add at least 25 larger tiny homes to the village that will have space for four people, nearly doubling the current occupancy. The tiny homes range in size, shape, and layout based on whether it's a two-bedroom or three-bedroom tiny house, Jeffreys said. The majority are 600 square feet and fit three people with a living area, kitchen, bathroom, extra vanity, one ground-level bedroom, and two lofted bedrooms. ""We surveyed folks and the things that came out were, 'We want privacy and affordable prices,'"" Jeffreys said. Privacy is what Sims is most thankful for in his tiny house. He said he has coworkers who share dorm-style rooms or railroad apartments. ""I honestly think I got the best deal,"" he said. ""There's privacy in the rooms and I know some others don't have that."" Jeffreys said the rent, which is between $470 and $600, is competitive, if not cheaper, than most of the other housing options Aspen Snowmass offers. Outside of the tiny house, residents receive access to storage units, a laundry room, a common lounge, and green space for gardening or outdoor activities. A paper sign posted on the door to the community lounge room reads, ""tiny town turn-up Tuesday."" The weekly BYOB event was initiated by residents, Melody Kappeli, the property's community manager, told Insider. For months, every Tuesday, a group gathered to play board games, drink, and if Sims was around, listen to him DJ. With ""tiny town turn-up Tuesday"" on pause due to COVID, Sims and a few of his neighbors recently transformed a green space into a terrain park for skiing. That outdoor area is something Sims and his neighbors wouldn't have access to in a traditional apartment. Overall, Sims said he's been surprised by the bonds he's made. ""I made some really good friends,"" he said. ""The community is awesome here.""

Case in point: Ice cream can be a big help for those with the Omicron variant of COVID-19, reports Eat This, Not That. Eat This spoke with Robert G.

Because I live with someone that has lactose issues, I never considered eating ice cream as a way to relieve the pain in my throat. Thinking back, I’m not even sure I would’ve enjoyed the ice cream; my sense of taste had also left me. When you’re stuck at home and not feeling well, comfort foods can be a big help—unfortunately, COVID symptoms can mess with that unique pleasure. Still, it’s worth trying. Lahita adds that, aside from just being a nice treat, ice cream has other benefits for those with COVID-19. For example, some COVID patients experience weight loss due to a lack of desire to eat. Ice cream can help with that. Ice cream also has a good amount of protein, which can help patients to feel full and satisfied. If ice cream isn’t for you, the doctor also recommends yogurt as an equally comforting alternative.

The panicked parents rushed to a taxi in hopes of catching the train at its next stop in the nearby city of Duisburg. But passengers who spotted the unaccompanied baby alerted the conductor, who ordered the train to return to Duesseldorf.

1/11/2022,"Trump said a GOP senator ""went woke"" and vowed never to endorse him again. Sen. Mike Rounds said on Sunday that the 2020 election result was ""as fair as we've seen."" Rounds also said the ""courts are the appropriate place"" to determine whether Trump can run again. Former President Donald Trump is vowing to never again endorse Sen. Mike Rounds after the South Dakota Republican called the 2020 presidential election ""fair"" in a Sunday appearance on ABC's ""This Week."" ""'Senator' Mike Rounds,"" Trump said in a statement, ""just went woke on the Fraudulent Presidential Election of 2020."" He criticized Rounds for saying the election was ""ok—just fine"" and baselessly claimed that there's ""evidence to the contrary"" in Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. ""Is he crazy or just stupid?"" Trump said. ""The only reason he did this is because he got my endorsement and easily won his state in 2020, so now he thinks he has time, and those are the only ones, the weak, who will break away. Even though his election will not be coming up for 5 years, I will never endorse this jerk again."" Trump went on to air grievances about ""Democrat-run cities"" and geopolitical conflicts around the world before concluding: ""He is a weak and ineffective leader, and I hereby firmly pledge that he will never receive my Endorsement again."" Rounds — who voted to certify the 2020 election results — affirmed the validity of the 2020 vote, telling ABC: ""The election was fair, as fair as we've seen. We simply did not win the election, as Republicans, for the presidency."" The second-term lawmaker also took aim at Trump's ongoing focus on the 2020 presidential election, suggesting that it could be detrimental to Republicans' prospects in future elections. ""Moving forward, we have to refocus once again on what it's going to take to win the presidency,"" Rounds said.

1/11/2022,"BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) — Amid Bosnia’s greatest political crisis since the end of its 1992-95 interethnic war, the country’s Serbs celebrated an outlawed holiday Sunday with a provocative parade showcasing armored vehicles, police helicopters and law enforcement officers with rifles, marching in lockstep and singing a nationalist song. Addressing several thousand spectators gathered in Banja Luka, the de-facto capital of the Serb-run part of the country, Bosnian Serb nationalist leader Milorad Dodik disparaged sanctions Washington slapped on him last week over his alleged corrupt activities and threats to tear the country apart. “This gathering is the best response to those who deny us our rights, … who keep imposing sanctions on us,” Dodik said. “It proves to me that I must listen to you, that you did not elect me to fulfil Americans’ wishes but to fulfil the wishes of Serb people,” he added. The Jan. 9 holiday commemorates the date in 1992 when Bosnian Serbs declared the creation of their own state in Bosnia, igniting the multi-ethnic country’s devastating, nearly 4-year-long war that became a byname for ethnic cleansing and genocide. The holiday was banned in 2015 by Bosnia’s top court which ruled that the date, which falls on a Serb Christian Orthodox religious holiday, discriminates against the country’s other ethnic groups — Muslim Bosniaks and Catholic Croats. During the war that killed 100,000 people and turned half of the country’s population into refugees, Bosniaks and Croats were persecuted and almost completely expelled from the now Serb-administered half of Bosnia. After the war, under the terms of the U.S.-brokered Dayton peace agreement, Bosnia was divided into two semi-autonomous governing entities — Republika Srpska and one dominated by Bosniaks and Croats. Each part has its own government, parliament and police, but the two are linked by shared, state-wide institutions, including the judiciary, army, security agencies and tax administration. All actions at a national level require consensus from all three ethnic groups. Dodik has for years been advocating the separation of the Bosnian Serb mini-state from the rest of the country and making it part of neighboring Serbia. This winter, he intensified his secessionist campaign, pledging to form an exclusively Serb army, judiciary and tax system. He described Bosniaks as “second-rate people” and “treacherous converts” who sold their “original (Orthodox Christian) faith for dinner.” Earlier Sunday, as part of holiday celebrations, Bosnian Serb officials participated in Serb Christian Orthodox ceremonies, broadcast live on local television, in the city’s main church, while a special police unit sang, while marching in the parade, a song about defending the Orthodox Christian cross and “the shiny new Serb Republic.” The celebrations of the divisive holiday continue each year despite it being outlawed by the top court, and have been consistently criticized by the U.S. and the European Union. However, the parade and other ceremonies on Sunday, were attended by the top officials of neighboring Serbia, including prime minister Ana Brnabic and parliament speaker Ivica Dacic; Russian and Chinese diplomats in Bosnia; and several officials of France's far-right National Rally party. In recent months, the staunchly pro-Moscow Dodik has repeatedly voiced hope that the Serbs’ “true friends” — Russia, China and the champions of illiberal democracy within the European Union — will serve as his bulwark against the “tyranny” of Western democracies",World/Associated Press,"Amid tensions, Bosnian Serbs celebrate outlawed holiday",https://news.yahoo.com/amid-tensions-bosnian-serbs-celebrate-131822722.html
