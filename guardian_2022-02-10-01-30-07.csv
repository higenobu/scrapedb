2/10/2022,"A man charged in an alleged plot to kidnap the Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, pleaded guilty on Wednesday, a second key conviction for the government a month before four others face trial. Kaleb Franks joined Ty Garbin as the second person to admit guilt in a plot to abduct the Democratic governor before FBI agents arrested them in October 2020. The plea gives prosecutors another important witness for the 8 March trial.  The government said the group wanted to kidnap Whitmer because of their opposition to her administration’s public health measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19. More than 900,000 people have died with Covid-19 in the US during the pandemic, far more than any other country worldwide. Franks replied, “yes, sir,” to a series of questions from US magistrate Judge Phillip Green about his role. He signed a document admitting he “was not entrapped or induced to commit any crimes” by undercover agents or informants. Garbin pleaded guilty in 2021 and was sentenced to slightly more than six years in prison. Franks acknowledged in court documents that he was deeply involved in the plot, which included outdoor training with firearms in Wisconsin and Michigan and scouting Whitmer’s second home in northern Michigan. In August 2020, less than two months before their arrest, Franks said he and a co-defendant “discussed their frustration with people who advocated anti-government action but were unwilling to use force themselves”. While there is no agreement on the length of his prison sentence, Franks could be rewarded if he “materially and substantially assists” the government. Besides Adam Fox, who is described as a ringleader, the remaining defendants are Barry Croft Jr, Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta. When the kidnapping case was filed in 2020, it added even more heat to the final weeks of a tumultuous election season. Then-president Donald Trump refused to denounce far-right groups who inspired anti-lockdown extremists across the country. Trump had earlier urged supporters to “LIBERATE” Michigan and two other states led by Democratic governors from stay-at-home mandates in April 2020. Dozens of US public health officials have reported receiving death threats for their work during the pandemic.

2/10/2022,"Ian Stewart’s ability to murder his first wife and resume a normal existence, going on to murder another partner, is beyond the comprehension of most. The cold duplicity of his actions would lead many to ask how was he capable of such deceit.  Forensic psychologists and criminologists have given their view on why Stewart was able to commit such awful crimes. Emma Kenny, a psychologist and TV presenter, said it was clear Stewart was an “organised serial killer”. She said it was possible for killers such as Stewart to “coexist perfectly in the world around you” as their lack of empathy allows them to be “very good at being a chameleon”. Kenny, who has her own YouTube true crime series, told the Guardian: “Quite often, if you’re an organised killer you might be someone who has held down a decent job or maintained a successful relationship, a monogamous relationship, they can often be someone you would want to spend time with, successful with friendships, charming … that’s what is so disconcerting about it.” Kenny, who appeared in an episode of the true crime series What the Killer Did Next about Ian Stewart’s murder of his fiancee, the author Helen Bailey, said he was a “narcissistic” killer. “They ask ‘what is it I need for my life’ and ‘how can this work for me’. If something is working for them, they may carry on as normal. If they see something they desire and a person is a pawn to get that … let’s say life insurance … then they may see that person as not being required anymore,” Kenny said. Kerry Daynes, a consultant forensic psychologist of more than 25 years, working in prisons, secure hospitals, courts and police stations, told the Guardian that Stewart’s behaviour could be explained by what is known as “cognitive distortion”, what she labels “mental gymnastics” that help people justify their actions. Daynes said this is a process most of us experience – she gives an example of someone on a diet making themselves feel comfortable and guilt-free about eating a slice of chocolate cake. But in Stewart’s case this twisted logic was taken to the extreme – to justify the killing of not one but two women. Daynes, author of autobiographical books What Lies Buried and The Dark Side of The Mind, said: “They make all kinds of cognitive distortions, they distort their thinking in order to give themselves permission to offend. “It doesn’t necessary make any logical sense – they know what they’re doing yet they’re able to compartmentalise. “So during his relationship with Helen Bailey at times he was able to simply live in the moment, actually enjoy the relationship, go through the motions and yet knowing what he was going to do and somewhere along the line he felt he was deserving of the money he would inherit.” Daynes, who appears on Faking It, the Discovery UK show about high-profile criminal cases where people claim in public they are innocent about a crime they have committed, said thinking he had got away with the murder of his first wife, Diane Stewart, would have given Stewart the confidence to set his sights on a wealthier target – Helen Bailey. She added: “This is somebody who has been able to live with it because he thinks he’s been successful, he’s been successful and he’s gone about planning it again, there’s no obvious remorse there and that’s what makes this so chilling.” She went on: “He clearly views women as commodities and at some point in his marriage, he started viewing his first wife as a commodity and thinking about what life would be like without her and what he would stand to gain from that.” “He’s always quite parasitic, averse to hard working life, he’s viewed these women not as human beings but as meal tickets.” Daynes said it was not unusual for men to kill their partners, with a woman killed by a current or former partner every three days, but the level of calculation in Stewart’s made it very unusual. “It’s very chilling because of the level of premeditation when it comes to Helen Bailey,” she said. “I think he’s somebody who has got a great sense of entitlement, he’s owed a living really, you see that in that he’s quite parasitic.”",News/UK news,Ian Stewart: the narcissistic serial killer who fooled everyone ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/09/ian-stewart-the-narcissistic-serial-killer-who-fooled-everyone
2/10/2022,"This isn’t the first time David Moyes’s judgment has been called into question. There was that interview in which he thought it would be most b@ntersome to threaten a female journalist with a slap, for example. Then there was the time he decided he was the very man to follow a 38-trophy-winning, paradigm-shifting, even-better-than-Busby legend, because what could possibly go wrong. Neither move was a good look, and on Tuesday evening he completed the personal trifecta by selecting Kurt Zouma, who earlier in the day had been caught on video kicking his poor innocent cat around his house in the piece-of-work style.  Most casual observers with warm blood pumping through their human hearts had expected Moyes to drop Zouma, who had been universally condemned for his appalling cruelty. But the West Ham boss had other ideas, deeming the big centre-back essential for a Premier League match against a Watford side currently tearing up the division with one goal in the last four games. However, had Moyes been labouring under the misapprehension that online opprobrium wouldn’t transfer over into the real world, the volume of boos Zouma received every time he touched the ball would have rattled all of the wax out of the manager’s tin ear. “I’m an animal lover,” Moyes insisted, after deciding that three points were more important than sending out the right message, punishing the player, a dignified response, etc and so on, and so forth. “I had to do my job,” he added, although his glazed expression, haunted even by those United/Sociedad/Sunderland standards, spoke of a man slowly realising he could have handled this a whole lot better. To that end, the club have now fined Zouma the maximum amount possible and promised to support Essex police and RSPCA investigations into the matter. Meanwhile, the player’s cats have been taken into RSPCA care, hopefully to be given a clean bill of health and found a loving forever home.

Ralf Rangnick is clearly still trying to come to terms with reality after Manchester United’s 1-1 draw at Burnley. “We scored three goals. That was different from last Friday when we only scored one goal,” he parped. “We scored three goals. The second one that was disallowed, the linesman flagged foul but 10 seconds after that incident. This was a very soft decision.” Frank Lampard’s Everton manager Frank Lampard has told everyone to calm down after the 3-1 defeat at Newcastle left the Toffees lingering perilously close to the relegation zone. “I’ve been here a week,” he yelped. “We’ve come into a very difficult match against Newcastle, who are very effective in some of their direct play.” Jürgen Klopp reckons Mo Salah would be well up for punishing Leicester with or without Afcon heartache to fuel him. “[Is there] greater determination for Mo? I am not sure that is human,” he blabbed. “I don’t think there’s a lot of space for more determination in Mo’s mind.” Achilles-knack means Steph Houghton is not in the England squad for the inaugural Arnold Clark Cup next week. “She is really, really disappointed,” sighed manager Sarina Wiegman. Walsall have bundled Matt Taylor through the door marked Do One after a seventh defeat in a row (1-0 at Firewall FC, in case you’re interested).

2/10/2022,"Jimmy Kimmel took issue with the 2022 Oscar nominations announced on Tuesday morning, which did not include a nod for last year’s biggest blockbuster, Spider-Man: No Way Home. “How did that not get one of the ten nominations for best picture? There were only 11 movies made this year!” he joked on Tuesday night.  “Forget the fact that the movie made $750m and is still going – this is a great movie. It wasn’t in the top 10 best movies of the year? There were three Spidermen in it!” Kimmel was particularly annoyed that Spider-Man, starring Tom Holland and Zendaya, was snubbed in favor of such “serious” movies as Don’t Look Up, a darkly comic parable for climate emergency directed by Adam McKay. “You’re telling me Don’t Look Up was better than Spider-Man? It most certainly was not,” Kimmel said. “When did we decide that the best picture has to be serious? As far as I know, this was not the point of feature film when they started making them. Ben-hur? Chariots and leprosy. Frankenstein? A monster powered by lightning. Fantasia? Mickey Mouse on an acid trip. The Wizard of Oz? Flying monkeys and a witch. These are great Oscar-worthy movies! “Now, there’s nothing wrong with a serious movie, a lot of them are fantastic and worthy of Oscars,” he added. “But why do they have to be serious, is what I’m saying. When did that become a prerequisite for getting nominated for an Academy Award?” “Here’s what happened,” he concluded. “The Academy voters, they looked at the list, they saw the names Leo DiCaprio and Meryl Streep, they checked that box, and then they put their kids in the car and they went to see the movie Spider-Man, and they loved it.” After seeing that 20-foot-long table, maybe Putin isn't trying to take over Ukraine because he's evil, maybe he just needs more space for his giant furniture. pic.twitter.com/gzGvJj6x5f On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah checked in on efforts to curb Russia’s incursion on the border of Ukraine, which has teetered on the brink of open conflict. “Because war is bad for business and also human life,” Noah explained, “every country is trying everything that they can to talk Russia down from its invasion plans,” including the president of France, Emmanuel Macron, who met with Russian president Vladimir Putin on Monday. “People had high hopes for this meeting,” said Noah. “Because the French and the Russians, they have a lot in common. For example, both have disgusting salad dressings named after them. But despite this commonality, the meeting did not go well.” After five hours of tense negotiations at the Kremlin, talks of de-escalation appeared to fail, and Macron warned that “the risk of destabilisation is increasing.” But Noah only had eyes for the biggest thing in the room: Putin’s massive white meeting table, was was over 20ft long. “Why are they sitting so far apart? I’ve been in zoom meetings where I’m sitting closer to the other person,” he mocked. “Why do you even have a table so big? Did you see that thing? Maybe Putin isn’t trying to take over Ukraine because he’s evil – maybe he just needs space for his giant fucking furniture.” “Apparently the reason for this distance is because they want to make sure that everyone is safe,” he continued. “And I’m not talking about Covid; I’m talking about Putin.

2/10/2022,"My brother David Liverman, who has died aged 66 of prostate cancer, was a British-Canadian geologist who became a tireless sports administrator in Newfoundland and Labrador, where he helped to regenerate interest in his favourite game, cricket. Having moved to Canada in his early 20s, David found it difficult to access cricket results in the early years of the internet and was one of the pioneers who developed Cricinfo from its origins as an email list into a fully fledged website. Living in Newfoundland, he discovered that cricket had been a popular sport there under British rule, but that interest had since faded. He decided to help to reinvigorate the game by offering his services as a volunteer organiser, coach and umpire, as well as develping school programmes. Eventually he became president of Cricket Newfoundland and Labrador, from 2017 to 2019, and also played a national role in managing Cricket Canada’s website, joining its board of directors.  In 2019 David was named as Sport Newfoundland’s executive of the year, and in 2021 Cricket NL named their summer league trophy the Liverman Cup in his honour, also creating the David Liverman Fairplay award. When Hollywood came to Newfoundland to make the film The Grand Seduction (2013) – in which a remote Newfoundland community tries to attract a doctor obsessed with cricket – he became the movie’s cricket consultant, checking dialogue and teaching actors how to play. David was born in Accra, Ghana, where our parents, John and Peggy, worked for the British Volta mission. He grew up in Redhill, Surrey, attending Reigate grammar school and the University of Edinburgh, where he studied geology. Moving to Canada, he completed an MSc and PhD in glacial geology at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, with a break to work in the oil industry and then to backpack around the world. In 1988 David was hired as a geologist by the Geological Survey of Newfoundland and Labrador in St John’s, where he eventually became director of the survey and then assistant deputy minister in the provincial department of natural resources, retiring in 2016. An adjunct professor of geography at Memorial University, his geological interests included geoscience communication, the glacial and sea level history of Newfoundland, and geological hazards. He wrote a book, Killer Snow: Avalanches of Newfoundland and Labrador (2007), which attracted considerable popular interest. Aside from his dedication to cricket, David also spent many hours as a volunteer involved with figure skating in Newfoundland, serving as a club president and as a provincial executive, and winning the Skate Canada Volunteer of Excellence award in 2007. He was very proud when his daughter, Beth, joined the staff of Skate Canada. In addition David, who was a lifelong Arsenal supporter, spent many hours on the football field as a referee, and became a national level refereeing instructor for the Canadian Soccer Association. He is survived by his wife, Sandra (nee Powell), whom he met in Edmonton when doing his postgraduate studies and married in 1986, by Beth, and by his two siblings, me and Michael.",Sport/Sport,David Liverman obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/09/david-liverman-obituary
2/10/2022,"Having thrashed mortal champions at poker, chess, Go, and Starcraft, an artificial intelligence program has delivered another humiliation, leaving the world’s best video game racing drivers in the dust. Researchers at Sony trained an AI called GT Sophy to play the PlayStation game Gran Turismo and found that it could outrace 95% of human players after two days and continued to shave tenths of a second off its lap times over the following week.  Beyond learning the fastest line to take around different race tracks, GT Sophy honed its tactics around acceleration and braking, when to tuck in behind a fast car in front, and when to break out of the slipstream and attempt to overtake. Faced with cars that blocked its path, GT Sophy switched to another racing line to bypass those ahead. To add to the challenge, GT Sophy had to take account of race penalties that were dished out for infringements based on ambiguous rules – echoing the fine human judgements that can make the difference between winning and losing in Formula One. “The success of GT Sophy in this environment shows for the first time that it is possible to train AI agents that are better than the top human racers across a range of car and track types,” the authors write in the journal Nature. The team led by Peter Wurman, the director of Sony AI America, based GT Sophy on a common AI technique called reinforcement learning. The AI was fed information from multiple Gran Turismo games and by maximising rewards for fast lap times and minimising penalties for collisions and such like, the program steadily mastered the game. As with other AIs that have trounced human champions, there is more to GT Sophy than playing games. Excelling at Gran Turismo demonstrates how an AI can learn strategies for working in a demanding situation where the vagaries of human judgment are crucial. For example, it may seem sensible to drive as close as possible to the car in front, but if the lead driver touches the brakes too early, the inevitable rear-ending suggests the strategy needs more work. More importantly, the breakthrough will feed into a debate about the best computational approaches to use in driverless cars. Neural networks of the kind that underpin GT Sophy and other AIs, such as those from DeepMind, have proven themselves at identifying objects in the world, but other driving tasks such as planning the best line to take are often based on pure physics. GT Sophy suggests neural networks might do a good job of this too. Despite the AI’s impressive debut, the Sony team concede that GT Sophy still has much to learn. On a long straight, the AI overtakes at the first opportunity, sometimes leaving enough road for the opponent to use GT Sophy’s slipstream and pass back. Without collision penalties, the authors noted GT Sophy became “notably more aggressive”. In an accompanying article in Nature, Prof Christian Gerdes, co-director of the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford University, who was not involved in the research, writes: “What really stands out is GT Sophy’s performance against human drivers in a head-to-head competition. Far from using a lap-time advantage to outlast opponents, GT Sophy simply outraces them.”",News/Technology,Sony trains AI to leave world’s best Gran Turismo drivers in the dust,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/09/sony-playstation-trains-ai-to-leave-worlds-best-gran-turismo-drivers-in-the-dust
2/10/2022,"Uganda’s president, Yoweri Museveni, has appointed a former military intelligence chief, who is blacklisted by the US over alleged rights violations, to lead the country’s feared police force. Uganda’s police and military have been accused of widespread human rights abuses, including arbitrary detention, torture and assassination. Much of the repression has been directed at opposition activists contesting the 36-year rule of Museveni.  The appointment of Maj Gen Abel Kandiho, who was recalled late on Tuesday from a new role as security envoy in South Sudan barely two weeks after being moved from his post as head of military intelligence, is a show of defiance towards the US and other western nations that have been critical of the deteriorating human rights situation in Uganda. Kandiho has “been appointed to the position of the Joint Staff of the Uganda police force,” Uganda’s military spokesperson, Lt Col Ronald Kakurungu, said in a statement. The US treasury hit Kandiho with sanctions last December alleging that he had presided over the arrest, detention and physical abuse of Ugandans “due to their nationality, political views, or critique of the Ugandan government”. “Individuals were taken into custody and held, often without legal proceedings, at [military intelligence] detention facilities where they were subjected to horrific beatings and other egregious acts … including sexual abuse and electrocutions, often resulting in significant long-term injury and even death. During these incarcerations, victims were kept in solitary confinement and [were] unable to contact friends, family, or legal support,” the treasury said, adding that in some cases Kandiho was personally involved, leading interrogations of detained individuals. The action freezes any US assets of Kandiho and generally bars Americans from dealing with him. There have been a series of crackdowns in Uganda aimed at stamping out dissent, with journalists attacked, lawyers jailed, election monitors prosecuted and opposition leaders violently muzzled. In the most recent case, a prominent author was held for nearly a month on charges of insulting Museveni and his powerful son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, in a case that has raised international concern. Kakwenza Rukirabashaija, a 33-year-old satirical novelist, says he was tortured in custody and appeared on television to reveal welts crisscrossed over his back and scars on other parts of his body. Rukirabashaija’s most acclaimed work is the satirical The Greedy Barbarian, for which he won a PEN Pinter prize, International Writer of Courage, last year. The novel tackles themes of corruption and greed and has widely been interpreted in Uganda as a reference to the political life of Museveni. Rukirabashaija has previously been arrested and questioned by the military about whether the novel was about the president. Days before Rukirabashaija was detained, he posted several comments critical of Museveni and Kainerugaba, including one in which he called Kainerugaba “obese” and assailed his military credentials, denouncing the purported plans to have him succeed his father. The detention of the writer and the allegations of torture have drawn criticism and calls for his release from local activists, international diplomats and rights defenders, including the US Senate foreign relations committee’s ranking member, Jim Risch, and Eamon Gilmore, the EU special representative for human rights. The EU and several member states issued a joint statement on Monday calling for a “comprehensive investigation” into rights abuses in Uganda. Last year, lawyers acting for the victims of a wave of abductions and torture by security forces in Uganda named senior military commanders, including Kainerugaba, in a complaint to the international criminal court. Charles Rwomushana, a security and military analyst, said on Wednesday that Kandiho’s appointment showed that Museveni wanted to “have a firm grip [on] the police force”. Kandiho will be “powerful enough” to make crucial decisions “in favour of [Museveni’s] government”, Rwomushana said. Once hailed as a reformist, Museveni has ruled Uganda with an iron fist since seizing control in 1986, when he helped end years of tyranny under Idi Amin and Milton Obote. The US provides almost $1bn annually in development and security assistance to Uganda, and officials say Washington plays “a key role in supporting the professionalisation of the military”.",News/World news,General accused of rights abuses made Ugandan head of police,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/09/general-accused-of-rights-abuses-made-ugandan-head-of-police
2/10/2022,"All remaining domestic Covid legal restrictions in England are likely to be scrapped later this month, Boris Johnson has announced. Here is what we know – and what is yet to be set out.  As first set out by Johnson in a brief statement at the start of prime minister’s questions all domestic rules, including the requirement for people with Covid to self-isolate, are expected to end later this month. Johnson said he would set out the new strategy when parliament returns from recess, on 21 February. The changes are likely to come into force on 24 February. Yes and no. When the government announced the end of so-called plan B Covid restrictions, for example on mask use, in January, it said the expectation was all domestic rules would end when relevant regulations lapsed on 24 March. Johnson has reinforced this intention and brought the timetable forward by a month. You will still be expected to isolate, rather than struggle into work, coughing over fellow commuters and colleagues. However, this will be guidance rather than, as is currently the case, a law backed up with fines reaching a maximum of £10,000. The new guidance will be set out before the rules change, and it remains to be seen how strongly worded it is – and whether employers will be sympathetic. At the moment, people on lower incomes obliged to self-isolate are eligible for a £500 payment. It is not known if this will stay in place with the voluntary regime. The TUC has warned that people should be given proper sick pay and not be forced to work. The testing system – no charge for instant lateral flow tests from pharmacies or sent via post, or for PCR tests at walk-in centres – will stay in place for now. It is a hugely expensive operation, and the expectation is that this will not be the case in the long term. Many of these have now gone, but it is likely that some will remain, for example people arriving in the UK needing to fill in a passenger locator form, and quarantine for people who are not vaccinated. More information will come in the new guidance post-recess. Yes, it is, as health policy is devolved across UK nations. Over time, restrictions have tended to be similar, but England has in recent months tended to move first in easing rules. There is certainly a longstanding view in public health that at some point Covid must be treated not as an emergency pandemic but a longer-term fact of life, which is mitigated in ways that allow everyday life to carry on. Downing Street has said it wants the virus to be seen as “endemic”, but with 60,000-plus confirmed cases a day, and the possibility of yet more variants, this is not something that can be simply willed. There is a suspicion that the advance of the timetable is connected to Johnson’s desire to please his mutinous backbenchers.",News/World news,What will happen after Covid rules are scrapped in England?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/09/what-will-happen-after-covid-rules-are-lifted-in-england
