2/18/2022,"Donald Trump's lawyer asked the New York Attorney General's office if it would investigate Hillary Clinton. It's a reference to a right-wing conspiracy theory claiming Clinton illegally spied on Trump's White House. The comment came in the middle of a court hearing over whether Trump should sit for a deposition about Trump Organization finances. Former President Donald Trump's attorney Alina Habba asked a lawyer from New York attorney general Tish James' office if they would ""go after Hillary Clinton"" in a hearing about whether the former president should be forced to sit for a deposition about his company's finances. ""I want to know, Mr. Wallace, Ms. James, are you gonna go after Hillary Clinton for what she's doing to my client?"" Habba said, referring to New York Attorney General Letitia James and Kevin Wallace, an attorney representing her in the hearing. ""That she spied at Trump Tower in your state? Are you gonna look into her business dealings?"" Judge Arthur Engoron stopped Habba's discussion of Clinton, saying they were irrelevant. ""The Clintons are not before me,"" he said. The conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton spied on Trump in the White House has proliferated through right-wing media outlets in recent days. As Insider previously reported, it stems from a misreading of court documents filed by the special counsel John Durham. The filing in question actually says that a lawyer with connections to Clinton obtained non-public data from the White House via a technology executive who had legal access to the data. The lawyer was charged last year with lying to the FBI, and while the details in the filing raised questions about the ethics of their conduct, it did not accuse the lawyer or the tech executive of spying or hacking. The court hearing Thursday morning was convened by New York State Supreme Judge Arthur Engoron to hear arguments on a totally unrelated issue. James is investigating the Trump Organization's finances and whether it broke bank, tax, and insurance laws by misrepresenting the values of its assets. Her office issued subpoenas to Donald Trump, Ivanka Trump, and Donald Trump Jr. to sit for depositions. Lawyers representing Trump and the Trump Organization have argued that James should be required to ask a grand jury to force the testimony, in which case they would be granted immunity in the case. James is running her civil investigation parallel to a criminal investigation in conjunction with the Manhattan District Attorney's office, which has already empaneled a grand jury. ""The only reason she is doing this is because he is a former president, and on the other side of the fence,"" Habba said of James, who ran for attorney general as a Democrat. But Wallace contested Trump that claim, noting that the Trump Organization in fact ""acceded"" to the scope of the probe. Wallace also disputed the notion that James targeted Trump because of personal animus. ""This was not someone who was unfamiliar to the office and who didn't already have legal issues around fraud,"" he said of the former president. ""I don't think any of this would suggest that there was an improper motive or improper purpose."" ""The legal issues are not unique,"" he said, later adding: ""The president is a citizen. He has to come in and appear just like anyone else.""

2/18/2022,"""We will choose to stand with Canadians who deserve to be able to get to their jobs..."" Trudeau added. After Trudeau's comment, the Speaker of the House of Commons warned him and lawmakers against using 'inflammatory' language. While the demonstrators in downtown Ottawa initially protested against cross-border COVID-19 vaccine mandates for truckers and pandemic restrictions, they have made clear their opposition to Trudeau and some say they want to kick him out of office. Michael Cooper, a Conservative lawmaker who handed out coffee during a recent protest in Ottawa, was pictured standing near a Canadian flag bearing a Swastika during a TV interview. He later released a statement condemning the ""reprehensible"" protester on Twitter. Lantsman fired back on Twitter, Wednesday, with a post that read, ""I think the Prime Minister should think long and hard about his own history before singling out a Jewish Member of Parliament and falsely accusing me of standing with a Swastika. What a disgraceful statement unbecoming of anyone in public office - he owes me an apology.""",Politics/Reuters Videos,Conservatives can ‘stand with people who wave swastikas’-Trudeau,https://news.yahoo.com/conservatives-stand-people-wave-swastikas-164816088.html
2/18/2022,"Tourists are flocking to catch a final glimpse of a Second World War shipwreck at risk of exploding before it is partially dismantled. The SS Richard Montgomery ran aground on a sandbank in the Thames Estuary in 1944, with 1,400 tons of high explosives aboard. Ever since, the American Liberty cargo vessel's three masts have protruded from the water, a macabre warning of the deadly risk below. The masts are becoming unstable and pose a risk of triggering a catastrophic explosion, so authorities have stepped in and will remove them. That has led to a flurry of interest from sightseers wanting to see the masts before they are gone. Martin Harmer owns the X-Pilot, a former Port of London Authority pilot boat, which offers passenger trips to a number of heritage sites off the Kent coast, including the SS Richard Montgomery. Mr Harmer said there has been a surge in interest in the wartime wreck following reports in December that the masts could be moved. ""We are normally very, very quiet up until around April time - this has blown up beyond all our expectations,"" he said. Visitors were coming from all over Britain, he told The Telegraph, as well as some international guests. Efforts were made to remove the ship's lethal cargo but the salvage operation had to be abandoned with approximately 1,400 tons of munitions still on board. Last year, the Ministry of Defence warned that if one of the masts collapsed, it could detonate the ship's contents and cause “mass damage and loss of life”. Mr Harmer said the ship has an ""air of mystery"" because of the rumours over the years of what could happen if the cargo detonated. He said that the Montgomery was usually only an “add on” to other tours, such as to the Redsands sea forts. However, he is now organising special trips just to the wreck. Such is the current interest in seeing the SS Richard Montgomery that most of the slots in the X-Pilot's weekend sailing schedule are booked up for months. However, Mr Harmer said more trips could be organised if interest continues. A precise timetable for when the masts will be removed has not yet been released.",World/The Telegraph,Tourists flock to see highly explosive Second World War shipwreck set to be partially dismantled,https://news.yahoo.com/tourists-flock-see-highly-explosive-143541898.html
2/18/2022,"Firefighters moved carefully across the frozen lake, at some points crawling their way toward the person seemingly stuck in the ice — but as rescuers got closer they realized something was wrong, Indiana officials said. Members of the Monroe Fire Protection District donned ice suits and headed out to Lake Monroe on Feb. 11, after receiving a call that someone’s head was “sticking out of the ice,” officials said in a social media post. The lake is about 60 miles southwest of Indianapolis. “Upon their arrival they immediately began rescue operations,” the post said. But rescuers soon noticed that the victim was actually just a mannequin’s head. Dummy or not, firefighters followed through with the rescue and brought the head to safety, photos show. “Sometimes you never know what type of call we might respond to,” officials said. “Thankfully this one turned out to be nothing serious.” ‘Bodies’ in roadside pond scare drivers – but aren’t what they seem, California cops say Driver saves phone — and his life — after truck falls through ice on Wisconsin lake Officers fall through frozen pond rushing to rescue teens in Utah, video shows Man driving with creepy clown mannequin also has a live grenade, Florida video shows",U.S./Kansas City Star,Rescuers spot a head sticking out of frozen Indiana lake — but it isn’t what it seems,https://news.yahoo.com/rescuers-spot-head-sticking-frozen-165026600.html
