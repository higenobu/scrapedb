5/19/2022,"In 2017, Donald Trump repeatedly claimed without evidence that between 3 million and 5 million unauthorized immigrants had voted for Hillary Clinton. In the last few weeks, Trump has resurrected his lie during campaign rallies for Republican primary candidates he has endorsed – whipping up fears of “open borders and horrible elections”, and calling for stricter voter ID laws and proof of citizenship at the ballot box. Trump endorsees and wannabes are amplifying this lie. JD Vance, the Trump-backed winner of last week’s Ohio Republican senate primary, claimed that President Biden’s immigration policy has resulted in “more Democrat voters pouring into this country”. In fact, voter fraud is exceptionally rare, and claims that widespread numbers of undocumented immigrants are voting have been repeatedly discredited. There is a problem of foreigners influencing American elections, however – but it has nothing to do with immigrants or fraudulent voting. It’s foreign money flowing into US campaigns. Some of the flow is clearly illegal. Last October, Lev Parnas, a Florida businessman who helped Rudy Giuliani’s effort to dig up dirt on Joe Biden in Ukraine, was convicted of funneling a Russian entrepreneur’s money to US politicians. The real scandal is how much foreign money flows into US elections legally. The US supreme court’s 2010 decision in Citizens United v Federal Election Commission opened the gates. It allows foreigners to influence US elections through their investments in politically active American corporations. The five-justice conservative majority said that when it comes to political speech, the identity of the speaker is irrelevant, and that more speech is always better. In dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens argued that the logic of the court’s ruling would allow foreign spending on American elections, threatening American interests. Stevens was right. If the identity of the speaker doesn’t matter and more speech is always better, what’s to stop foreign spending on US elections? Non-Americans whose money is now finding its way into American campaigns – mostly benefiting Republican candidates – include Russian oligarchs, the Saudi royal family, European financiers, Chinese corporate conglomerates and many other people and organizations that owe their allegiance to powers other than the United States. The growing problem centers on three realities: First, foreign investors now own a whopping 40% of the shares of American corporations. That’s up from just 5% in 1982. Second, American corporations are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to influence elections – counting their separate corporate political action committees or personal donations by executives and employees. Much of this spending is through dark money channels that opened after the Citizens United decision. Third, by law, corporate directors and managers are accountable to their shareholders, including foreign shareholders – not to America. As the then-CEO of US-based Exxon Mobil unabashedly stated, “I’m not a US company and I don’t make decisions based on what’s good for the US.” The second and third points pose substantial threats to American democracy on their own. Add in the first, and you’ve got a sieve through which non-Americans – whose interests don’t necessarily correspond to the interests of the United States – assert growing influence over American politics. Follow the money. In recent years, Russian billionaire oligarchs have bought significant amounts of Facebook, Twitter, and Airbnb. Saudi Arabia owns about 10% of US-based Uber and has a seat on its board. Many of America’s largest corporations with substantial foreign ownership (including AT&T, Comcast and Citigroup) have contributed millions of dollars to the Republican Attorney Generals Association, which in turn bankrolled the pro-Trump rally on the morning of the January 6 insurrection. What to do about this? The Center for American Progress has a sensible proposal: it recommends that no US corporation with 5% or more of its stock under foreign ownership or 1% or more controlled by a single foreign owner be allowed to spend money to sway the outcomes of US elections or ballot measures. Corporate governance experts and regulators agree that these thresholds capture the level of ownership necessary to influence corporate decision-making. OK, but how to get this proposal enacted, when big American-based corporations with significant foreign investment have so much influence over Congress? Democrats should make this an issue in the run-up to the 2022 midterms. While Republicans rail against the utterly fake danger to the United States of undocumented immigrants voting in American elections, Democrats should rail against the real danger to American democracy of foreign money affecting American elections through foreign investments in American corporations.

5/19/2022,"Suppose the chancellor wanted to follow Scottish Power’s advice, and give Britain’s most hard-up households £1,000 towards their energy bills this winter? Would it be possible to raise the £10bn needed in a way that didn’t just tax the same people he would be trying to help? I can think of at least three options, any of which would do the job, and all of which would make the tax system better as well. First, Rishi Sunak could raise capital gains tax rates to match income tax rates, and reintroduce an inflation allowance, as his predecessor Nigel Lawson did in 1988. It was the top recommendation by Sunak’s own advisers, the Office of Tax Simplification, in 2020. This could raise up to £16bn. While some people will doubtless delay cashing in gains to avoid the tax, the chancellor should comfortably reach £10bn even accounting for this. A reformed capital gains tax would also be fairer, reducing the opportunity for some to game the system to pay lower effective tax rates. Second, he could apply national insurance contributions consistently across all sources of income. If you earn an average income, you’ll be paying 13.25% in national insurance on every extra pound you earn. Someone with a higher income ­– your MP, for example, on a salary of almost £85,000 – is paying only 3.25%. And landlords pay a tidy 0%. Other oddities include that national insurance is currently at zero after pension age, even for those in work, and effectively 1.25% on dividends. Fixing all these inconsistencies to tax all income consistently would raise more than £30bn, so the chancellor would have some money to spare to cut taxes, invest in education, or undo the cuts to the aid budget. Third, he could introduce an annual wealth tax of 1.1% on individual wealth above £10m, after netting off mortgages and other debts. This would raise £10bn from the wealthiest 0.04% of the population. For this group the usual economic arguments against a wealth tax, for example that it discourages savings, do not apply. There are also practical benefits, as existing taxes on wealth are not effective at raising tax from this group: a government report in 2018 showed that they are able use reliefs to pay just a 10% effective rate of inheritance tax – half the rate paid by individuals with £2m in wealth. Each of these options is good economics, raises some much-needed money, and would improve the tax system. But none should deter the chancellor from a fourth bit of good economics: a windfall tax on energy companies. Their current higher profits are nothing to do with their own efforts, and everything to do with the economic fallout of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Labour says this could raise £2bn as a one-off, but there are no independent estimates yet. However, it is Economics 101 that such windfalls should be taxed highly. Whatever it raises can then be put to constructive use, whether supporting low-income households or funding incentives for green investment. There are plenty of options for the chancellor to ease the cost of living crisis. Imagine if he were brave enough to implement them all.

5/19/2022,"The sprinter Reece Prescod has become the first British athlete to publicly forgive CJ Ujah for failing a drugs test and costing Team GB a 4x100m relay silver medal at last year’s Tokyo Olympics. Prescod, who ran the 100m for Team GB in Japan and was a reserve for the 4x100m team, revealed that he had reached out to Ujah – who has blamed a contaminated supplement after the banned substances ostarine and S23 were found in his urine – and hoped to see him running again. “We’ve spoken and me and CJ are cool,” said Prescod. “It was his birthday, I reached out to him, we had a conversation. He was very upset by what unfortunately happened. “Some of the boys went to his party, a small gathering of his close family and friends,” he added. “He’s still a person at the end of the day. You can’t just rule someone out.” Prescod’s stance is notably more sympathetic than that of the British Olympic Association and his other teammates. Richard Kilty, for instance, who was one of the other members of the 4x100m team, has called Ujah’s behaviour “sloppy and reckless” – and said he would never forgive him. What particularly frustrated Kilty was that Ujah said he was using supplements that were not batch-tested by Informed Sport – which meant that he had no defence when banned substances were found in his urine in Tokyo. Ujah is now facing a four-year ban, although he is hoping that his contaminated supplement defence may get that reduced. “I personally think he’ll run again, definitely,” added Prescod. “Of course I’d like him to. Got to see where his legal situation goes but CJ was extremely talented, one of the most talented sprinters we’ve ever had. It would be nice for him to get back on a track and run again. It’s one of those unfortunate things that can happen.” Prescod, meanwhile, competes over 100m in the Birmingham Diamond League on Saturday hoping to make up for lost time after overcoming injuries and the weight he piled on during lockdown due to too many Deliveroo orders. The talented 26-year-old also believes he is a much stronger athlete after a hard winter with his coach, Marvin Rowe, and is capable of running both the 100m and 200m at major championships. “Marvin is actually building a stronger Reece, a more robust Reece,” said Prescod, who faces a strong field including 200m Olympic champion Andre de Grasse on Saturday. “So when it actually comes down to the championships, when you have to run round after round after round, I will be ready.” “I know what is required, and that’s to run sub-10 regularly,” he added.",Sport/Sport,Reece Prescod becomes first Team GB athlete to publicly forgive CJ Ujah,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/19/reece-prescod-becomes-first-team-gb-athlete-to-publicly-forgive-cj-ujah
5/19/2022,"Hello and Happy Thursday, On Tuesday, Georgia voters will cast their ballots in what I believe is the most important primary election this year: the Republican primary for secretary of state. This morning, we published a story from reporting I did earlier this month about the race between incumbent Brad Raffensperger, the Republican who became nationally known for refusing to overturn the election results, and his Trump-backed challenger and big lie peddler, Congressman Jody Hice. I interviewed voters with a question in mind. Several polls over the last year have shown that the vast majority of Republicans believe Joe Biden’s victory was not legitimate. I was curious to see whether that belief was translating into who they were voting for. Would voters kick Raffensperger out of office for saying the election was legitimate? To my surprise, I didn’t find a huge amount of momentum for Hice, who has said the 2020 election was stolen and tried to overturn it. Instead, I found a lot of voters who said they supported Trump, but were also voting for Raffensperger. “I felt that under all that pressure, he did a good job. I know it upset Trump, and I’m a Trump person, but fair is fair,” said Carolee Curti, 82, who voted for Raffensperger in Rome, which is in the heart of Marjorie Taylor Greene’s deeply Republican district in north-west Georgia. “I think something happened, but I don’t know anything like everybody else. I don’t know that Raffensperger did anything bad either,” said Judy C, 80, who declined to give her full name after she cast her vote for Raffensperger in Lawrenceville, an Atlanta suburb. “Trump, excuse me, he should keep his mouth shut.” Another 78-year-old Republican voter who only gave his first name, Bob, said he had automatically ruled out voting for anyone who said the election was stolen. “If you claim the last election was fraudulent, I’m not voting for you,” he told me. “If you asked people to go illegally try and overthrow the election, I’m not voting for you.” He declined to say who he voted for, but said it was probably safe to say he didn’t cast a ballot for Hice. In early May, some voters like Susan Cox, a 69-year-old retiree in Rome, said they weren’t following the race very closely yet. But she said she didn’t believe the election was stolen. “I think that there’s always been discrepancies in it. Nobody can really say that everything was done right,” she said. “I really think no, that it wasn’t stolen but there were things that were not done right.” That’s not to say that I didn’t talk to voters who were backing Hice. “I didn’t think the results were honest. I think there was a lot of corruption that went on. And the current secretary of state didn’t know how to do an adequate investigation,” said Mike Albright, 62, who voted for the congressman. Tom and Emily Saltino, retirees in their 80s in Rome, also told me they voted for Hice. They weren’t convinced Trump lost – they had seen the crowds Trump drew when he came to Georgia, and attended the rally they had in Rome. It didn’t seem plausible, they said, that he could draw such massive crowds and lose the election. Outside of the Republican primary, I spent a sizzling hot afternoon in a west Atlanta neighborhood with Jazmine Cook, 30, and Alexis Hill, 20, as they canvassed in west Atlanta for the New Georgia Project, a non-partisan group that has worked to boost voter participation. They’ve been knocking on doors for the last few months, and I asked whether they had been hearing from folks who were concerned about whether their votes would be thrown out. Hill said it hadn’t really come up in her conversations, but Cook said it had. “They’ll say that they’re not voting because they don’t trust that their vote is going to be counted for. And so, I try to convince them that they still should vote. I’d say that 90% of them are adamant that they’re not participating because their vote doesn’t even matter,” she said. As I followed Raffensperger throughout the week, something else stood out to me. I noticed that even though he still defends the 2020 election results, he still is embracing significant restrictions on voting. The central issue in his campaign is preventing non-citizen voting, which is virtually non-existent in Georgia or across the United States. He wants to amend a federal law to allow state officials to conduct mass removals of voters close to election day and he also wants to get rid of no-excuse mail-in voting, which was adopted by Republicans and has been used without controversy until the 2020 election. In any normal election, these would be deeply controversial ideas. Andra Gillespie, a professor at Emory, told me that Raffensperger’s focus on non-citizen voting in particular was an effort to appeal to his conservative base. “While the secretary of state upheld the law, he is not friendly to voter rights,” Bee Nguyen, a Democratic state representative who is also running for secretary of state, told me. “And some of his policy positions, specifically cracking down on non-citizen voters, that is leading into the big lie.” Also worth watching … Doug Mastriano, a Pennsylvania Republican who played a key part in Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, earned his party’s nomination for governor on Tuesday. Florida governor Ron DeSantis appointed a lawmaker who cursed at colleagues and sponsored an anti-protest bill to be the state’s top election official. The Georgia state election board dismissed a complaint that purported to show a man illegally dumping five ballots. Investigators found the man was dropping off ballots on behalf of family members. A local election board in Georgia dismissed a man’s effort to challenge the eligibility of more than 13,000 voters.",News/US news,Georgia secretary of state primary will test big lie’s hold on Republicans,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/19/georgia-secretary-of-state-primary-will-test-big-lies-hold-on-republicans
5/19/2022,"Britain could become a world leader in cultured meat production post-Brexit by outflanking the EU to bring the hi-tech products to market swiftly, industry leaders say. Cultured meat is grown from animal cells in a bioreactor that can be powered by 100% renewable energy, thereby curbing both greenhouse gas emissions and animal cruelty. EU product approvals for the technology will take up to three years but the lab-grown meat sector is hoping that a post-Brexit white paper on the national food strategy due in May could accelerate the UK process. Figures in the £1.9bn global industry say they have already had meetings with the UK’s Food Standards Agency on the post-Brexit regulatory framework for the products. In Singapore where products made from cultivated meat are already on sale, the evaluation process takes nine to 12 months. “There’s definitely an opportunity for the UK to become one of the primary innovation hubs for these sorts of novel technologies,” Robert Jones, the head of the Cellular Agriculture Europe trade association told the Guardian. “The UK is a large market and every company will be looking at it as an incredible commercial opportunity,” said Jones, who is also an executive for the Dutch startup Mosa Meat. The company hopes to seek regulatory approval for two beef products later this year. Peter Verstrate, its co-founder, said that the UK “would be at least a year ahead of the EU” in bringing products to market if it adopted a six- to nine-month assessment period. Last year the UK Food Standards Agency chair, Prof Susan Jebb, described lab-grown meat as one of “the new innovations that might help us to change course” away from climate catastrophe. A “lens of environmental sustainability” might be applied to novel, safe and sustainable foods, she suggested. A Defra spokesperson said: “We want to create the best possible environment for innovators, investors and consumers, and encourage safe innovation in the sustainable protein sector.” The EU’s regulatory process can be lengthy in part because approval is needed from experts of all 27 member nations. Edward Bray, a spokesperson for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), stressed that its scientific assessments took place within a nine-month window – although the clock on this could be stopped “if further data or clarification are required”. Beyond that, the approvals timeline “is in the hands of the EU legislators who are responsible for the regulatory processes,” he said. “This is outside the EFSA’s remit.” The EFSA’s ability to return to a business with additional questions several months after an application was filed made investment and operations decisions very difficult, said Russ Tucker, the co-founder of Ivy Farm, which plans to file for approval of a cultured mince line in the UK this year. “While I’m waiting for a decision, how can I then build a facility, deploy capital, recruit people, and get supply arrangements with supermarkets and restaurants? It’s very difficult to make those business decisions when there isn’t transparency on how the application is moving through the process,” he said. “There’s a big opportunity for the UK to think about how to do things differently from the EU,” he added. About a quarter of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, mostly livestock production. Lab-grown meat could substantially reduce this, according to the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – with some studies projecting emissions savings of up to 80%. But food safety will be crucial as new technologies raise new risks. Cells used to make cultivated meat could become contaminated, or suffer “dysregulation,” as happens with cancer cells, after being multiplied many times. The technology’s bioreactors are also energy intensive and, as with electric cars, the use of fossil fuel-powered grids would limit emissionsavings. A recent report by the thinktank IPES-Food said claims that lab-grown meat was sustainable were “limited and speculative.” The paper also dismissed assumptions that the technology could help feed a more affluent world population of up to 10 billion by 2050. “I would [also] be concerned that most of the data on [product] safety are coming from the firms themselves,” said Prof Philip Howard, an IPES-Food expert. “There aren’t enough independent studies. This is a very new technology and frankly it’s not commercially viable. There’s no way to make money on it so pushing for regulatory approval is premature.” Clare Oxborrow of Friends of the Earth added: “This is a technology that’s still in its infancy and poses many questions, including who owns and benefits from it.” Meat processors such as JBS, Tyson and Cargill are increasingly investing in the startup sector, according to IPES-Food but states are getting in on the act too. Last month, the Dutch government ploughed €60m (£51m) into cellular agriculture technology, shortly after moving to allow tastings of the slaughter-free tech. In Israel a clean meat consortium was also awarded an $18m (£14m) government grant.",News/Environment,Lab-grown meat firms say post-Brexit UK could be at forefront,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/19/lab-grown-meat-firms-post-brexit-uk-regulation
5/19/2022,"As the first opera by a woman commissioned and presented by the Vienna State Opera, Olga Neuwirth’s Orlando, “a fictional musical biography in 19 scenes”, was headline news even before its premiere in 2019. Neuwirth and her librettist Catherine Filloux’s adaptation of Virginia Woolf’s story of an Elizabethan aristocrat who travels through four centuries, switching genders en route, extends the chronology of the novel from 1928, the year of its publication, through to the present day, taking in the Holocaust and the second world war, the social upheavals of the 1960s and the consumerism and greed of the 80s, right up to the rightwing populism of Trump. That’s an awful lot of history to cram into a single stage work, and even though Orlando lasts three hours, and there’s a spoken commentary to provide a narrative thread, it leaves little room for real musical or psychological characterisation. Neuwirth’s score, fusing orchestral, electronic and sampled sounds, is often bewitching despite her rather unengaging vocal lines, while the use of musical quotations, from Elizabethan polyphony to Lady Gaga, is certainly entertaining. But the wit of Woolf’s original is nowhere to be found, and dramatically the opera gets thinner as it goes on. The final scenes, in which Neuwirth and Filloux introduce the character of Orlando’s non-binary child, played by the cabaret performer Justin Vivian Bond, seem more like noisy sloganising than convincing music theatre, and the music itself feels far less striking, despite the appearance of an on stage band. The Vienna production, though, clearly didn’t stint on anything. Some of the sense of grandeur may be lost on a small screen, but the use of video, with texts projected on to the set, as well as the sumptuous costumes by Comme des Garçons, is certainly lavish. The director is Polly Graham, who took over the production only a couple of months before the premiere, by which time presumably the visuals had been finalised; she certainly marshals the spectacle efficiently, but could do little about the lack of depth in the characters, who often seem more caricature than flesh and blood. As Orlando, the mezzo Kate Lindsey is outstanding in what is a hugely demanding role; the narrator, Anna Clementi (a late replacement, apparently, for Fiona Shaw) is less convincing, while Constance Hauman provides a telling cameo as the Queen. Matthias Pintscher is the conductor, efficiently coordinating everything; the combined effort is tremendous, the final effect rather less than might have been hoped. John Eliot Gardiner’s touring versions of the three surviving Monteverdi operas were the highlights of the composer’s 450th-anniversary year in 2017, and recordings of those concert stagings are now being released by Opus Arte. L’Orfeo and Il Ritorno d’Ulisse in Patria have appeared so far, both taken from the performances in La Fenice, Venice; they capture very well the uncomplicated power of these modern-dress concert stagings, directed by Gardiner and Elsa Rooke, with a troupe of singers who take on roles in each of the operas. It’s the dramatic power of Monteverdi’s music that comes through most strongly, exactly as it should.",Arts/Music,Olga Neuwirth: Orlando review | Andrew Clements's classical album of the week,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/19/olga-neuwirth-orlando-review-vienna-state-opera-virginia-woolf-kate-lindsey
5/19/2022,"Have you seen 1970’s Mark of the Devil, 1973’s Flesh for Frankenstein or 1974’s Blood for Dracula recently? What are your thoughts on how they have aged? NatMikeel No, I don’t watch my old films. I’m not one of those actors who has friends over and after dinner says: “Oh, let’s put on one of my movies.” I’ve made 275 films, a lot of which I want to forget but also some I will never forget. Your appearance in Madonna’s 1992 video to Deeper and Deeper kicks off with you orating: “Beware! Our idols and demons will pursue us until we learn to let them go.” What demons have pursued you during your career? McScootikins Only one demon: time. Time is the biggest demon in the world. Nobody can put time back, but if you could, you would do a lot of things differently. I’ve been working for 55 years, but I never wanted to be an actor. It came just by luck. I was born in Germany in 1944 at the end of the war. It was a very sad time with no money. I lived with my mother. I never met my father because he remarried and didn’t want to admit that he had three children from his previous marriage. My mother couldn’t afford to send me to high school, so I decided to work in a factory to earn enough money to move to London to learn English. While studying at St Giles International on Oxford Street, I bumped into [British actor and director] Michael Sarne, who wanted to cast me in the 1966 short film The Road to Saint Tropez. I said: “I don’t know how to act.” He said: “Leave that to us.” I was a very photogenic young man, so when the film came out in London and I was close up on the screen in Cinemascope, I was described as “the new face of cinema”. I liked the attention, so I decided to become an actor. I watched Lars von Trier’s 1994-97 TV series The Kingdom some years ago. It’s strange, unsettling and one of my all-time favourites. What are your memories of being directed by a young Von Trier? GennyLee I’m happy because I’m the only actor in the world who has been born on screen! There is this beautiful, big naked woman. I’m in her stomach, lying on a piece of wood with four wheels. I hear the word “Action!”, push myself between the legs, so I’m just a head, and go: “Waaaaah!” I’ve worked with Lars for 30 years and have loved being in his movies. Thinking about how central your costume is in Swan Song, how did you go about constructing your character? Vladthethird The director sent me the script. I read it twice, called him and said: “I want you to come to Palm Springs to meet you to know if we can work together.” He came and he was a very nice man. I had certain requests. I wanted to stay in a retirement home, to sleep in the bed, look out the window, see the trees and birds, look in every drawer, and get used to the room being mine. So I lived there for a while, having coffee with the old people, with no film people around. I also said: “I want to shoot chronologically,” which would have been only possible in a low-budget, independent film, and not something I could have demanded in Armageddon or End of Days. The costume is interesting because it’s so green … I kept it on even after shooting. Everyone knew me by my character’s name, Pat, so we’d go out in the evening and the barman would say: “Chardonnay, Pat?” and I’d say: “Yes, thank you!” One of your wildest productions has to be Flesh for Frankenstein – the notorious X-rated Andy Warhol/Paul Morrissey movie. How did you get involved? wigsbysimonI was living in Rome, sitting next to this American man on the plane to Munich. He said: “What do you do for a living?” and I said: “I’m an actor.” He said: “Interesting,” took out his American passport and wrote my number on the last page. I said: “Who are you?” and he said: “My name is Paul Morrissey, I’m the director for Andy Warhol.” A couple of weeks later, I got a call: “Hey, it’s Paul, you remember, from the plane? I’m doing Frankenstein for [Italian producer] Carlo Ponti and I have a little role for you.” I said: “Great, who do I play?” “Baron von Frankenstein.” We shot the movie in three weeks for $300,000. On my last day, I was very sad because Warhol had said that everyone is famous for 15 minutes, and now my 15 minutes had gone away. I went to the cantina, had a glass of wine, and Morrissey walked in. They were filming Flesh for Frankenstein and Blood for Dracula back to back, and he said: “I guess we have a German Count Dracula now.” I said: “Who?” and he said: “You, but you have to lose 10 pounds in one week.” I said: “No problem,” and ate only salad leaves and water for a week. On the first day of shooting, I was introduced to Vittorio De Sica – this great Italian actor who was also in Dracula. I was so weak from only eating salad leaves and water, I was in a wheelchair because I couldn’t stand up. The lamp dance scene in 1991’s My Own Private Idaho is an iconic moment in your career. How did that scene come about? jeroenspeculaas I went to a film festival in Berlin and a young director came up and said: “My name is Gus Van Sant, I have a little film here, [1985’s] Mala Noche, which I made for $20,000, but my next film is going to be with Keanu Reeves and River Phoenix, and I’d like you to be in it.” I thought he was all talk, but he got me my permit to work in America, and 30 years later, I’m still here. When I went to Portland to shoot the film, I told him a story that when I was performing as a singer in Moscow, the people at the stadium forgot to give me a microphone but I had a flash lamp, so – as I was miming – I used that instead. He said: “I want you to sing to the two boys with this big lamp.” I said: “No, it’s too big,” but it worked, even though I can’t sing. Nobody has ever asked me to sing in a role. They’re very polite. I never wanted to be an actor. I never studied acting. My philosophy is that talent is something you cannot learn. You have it, or you don’t. You can learn a technique. So if you want to play Shakespeare, you need to go to acting school, but not for films. I know more about modern art than I do movies. Just to give you an idea [gestures at paintings on the wall]: David Hockney, I’ve known since 1975. Salvador Dalí, Keith Haring, Robert Longo – who directed 1995’s Johnny Mnemonic … When I sit in the morning, have a coffee and see on the wall: “For Udo, with love, Andy Warhol,” that gives me the energy for the day. What was it like working with Wesley Snipes in Blade, and Arnie in End of Days? WoodWorker2008 / Koolds67 At the audition for Blade, I said to the director, Stephen Norrington: “My idea is to play the vampire like a stockbroker, so very calculating.” I say to Stephen Dorff: “You’re not even a pure blood. I have lived like this for thousands of years.” Wesley Snipes was wunderbar. And with End of Days, I was excited, finally meeting Arnold Schwarzenegger. We went to Germany together for the premiere. I like actors. A lot of times, good actors are the nicest people in the world. When I started as a young actor, I was always compared to Terence Stamp. So when we finally made a movie together in London [2001’s Revelation], I said: “Let’s go to the mirror.” And we looked in the mirror and both said: “I don’t look like you.” How do you make a character truly spine-chilling, rather than a pantomime villain doing a parody of evil? MMANinjaAssociation When you’re German and you come to America, you play the Nazi because of the accent. I have a television show coming out soon [season two of Hunters] with Al Pacino, where I play Adolf Hitler. So, there’s two ways to play a villain. The first is: I have a gun, and I shoot you. Bang. The second: I point the gun at you, clean my fingernails and say: “When I’m done, I’m going to kill you,” look at my fingernails and – bang. I made a film, 2017’s Downsizing, with Matt Damon and Christoph Waltz, who was so wonderful in 2009’s Inglourious Basterds, because he had such fun playing an evil guy. It’s fun to play evil, because the devil was an angel who didn’t want to be an angel any more. So you get to play the devil, which is a lot of fun. But if you are really evil, you cannot play an evil character. Out of all your films, which do you think is the best? badchampions I cannot answer that. As an actor, you can only choose the films that changed your life, for example 1973’s Flesh for Frankenstein and 1974’s Blood of Dracula, I was suddenly with Andy Warhol in Vogue and Rolling Stone. When I did 1975’s Story of O, which was so erotic it was banned in England, people went by train to Paris just to see the movie. Meeting Walerian Borowczyk was very important because I met him when I was living in Paris, after Story of O, and he asked me to be in 1980’s Lulu, playing Jack the Ripper, which we shot in Berlin. Then he asked me to play Dr Jekyll in Docteur Jekyll et Les Femmes. But I met all these directors by chance and not by thinking: “Terrence Malick is in town. I need to find out which restaurant he’s eating at …” I’m a very lucky man. With Swan Song, I’ve got critics saying: “Finally, after 50 years, Udo Kier becomes the leading man.” I worked with some of the best directors in the world, but I have never said to a director: “I would like to work with you.” Imagine if I was having dinner with David Lynch and Isabella Rossellini and I said to David: “I would like to work with you.” He would answer: “Who doesn’t?”  Swan Song is in UK cinemas from 10 June",Arts/Film,Udo Kier: ‘I was so weak from eating only salad leaves to play Dracula I was in a wheelchair’,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/19/udo-kier-i-was-so-weak-from-eating-only-salad-leaves-to-play-dracula-i-was-in-a-wheelchair
5/19/2022,"It is ironic that this production reconceptualises Sophocles’ Antigone in a future dystopia yet captures the strong sense of ancient ritual, and spectacle, in this climactic Theban play. Originally staged by the Classical Theatre of Harlem in 2018 and now streamed free of charge (the film is edited by Shawn René Graham and Ty Jones), the story of Antigone’s rebellion against King Creon comes with plenty of nods to our own age. A news ticker rolls out the latest on the warring brothers, Eteocles and Polynices, who are dead at the start of the play, the latter’s body ordered to be left untouched by Creon – rather than be buried – because of his disobedience against the state. Directed by Carl Cofield, much of the production’s strengths lie in its focus on music (under Kahlil X Daniel’s direction) and choreography (by Tiffany Rea-Fisher), which feels as important as the text here. There are kinetic projections (by Katherine Freer) that scale the full breadth of the stage along with showers of light (designed by Alan C Edwards). A powerful chorus of singers switch from gospel to Afro-punk, and there is a parallel chorus of dancers. The script swivels neatly between stately dialogue and modern-day vernacular, which brings amusement. When Creon is in the grip of a crisis over his decision to banish Antigone, he asks a chorus member: “Do you think I should concede?” to which comes the tart reply: “Is Harlem Black?” The sentry (Anthony Vaughn Merchant) who runs on to bring news that Polynices has been given burial libations illicitly, pulls out an asthma inhaler as he tries to catch his breath, and becomes his own ancient Greek standup act. “Poly-not-so-nices,” he says of Antigone’s dead brother, and sounds like a latter-day version of Shakespeare’s fool. He is hugely entertaining, although this comedy undercuts some of the play’s tragic depth. This modern-ancient hybrid continues in every aspect of the stagecraft, including Christopher and Justin Swader’s set design of courtly marble stairs and a shrine to the dead with a host of placards. “Black Lives Matter”, reads one. “Justice for Polynices”, reads another. Sisters Antigone (Alexandria King) and Ismene (Ava McCoy) are strong and ardent in their decisions to obey or disobey the king. Antigone has great dignity while Creon, played by Ty Jones, is a strongman leader in gold chains and cloak. That the actors play their characters rather flatly and with little nuance does not matter in light of the fireworks of musical and visual effects. Tiresias’s (Kahlil X Daniel) prophecy of doom brings melodramatic spotlights and floods of red. It seems to be part of a brazen intention to entertain, above all else. At only an hour long, it does just that.

5/19/2022,"Lovely to play but sad to think about, this game follows three pastel-coloured gibbons from their natural treetop habitat through the lumber camps and human habitations that have been rapidly replacing it. It’s neither long nor complicated, getting its point across with striking art that contrasts zoomed-out natural landscapes – gorges, jungles, waterfalls, against sunsets and morning skies, all crowded with trees and hanging vines and vegetation – with the movement and bustle of the towns, crowded with people and vehicles. Simple controls have your endangered apes swinging from branch to branch – all you have to do is time it correctly and you’ll build momentum and sail across the canopy, occasionally catching a boost from your buddy. Swinging free from trees and vines is much easier than climbing the buildings and power lines of the human environments, a neat illustration that underlines the game’s message about habitat destruction and poaching. As a player, you feel a surge of giddy delight when you somersault across a gap in the canopy before grabbing on to the next branch, the gibbons’ hooting echoing across the space; in a crowded town, that delight gives way to frustration and annoyance, all sound drowned out by motors and construction noise. Once they are forced to leave the jungle, row after row of uniform palm trees give the gibbons little shelter, and the burnt-out deforested wasteland gives them none at all. Performance, however, on the Nintendo Switch version was not great in crowded areas, something that the developer is working to fix. A stuttering frame rate makes it actively more difficult and unpleasant to play as you get further through, and this time not in an intentional way. This put me off from playing much beyond the brief but affecting 90-minute story; after that you can continue to swing around and rescue other endangered animals in an endless mode that resets whenever your gibbon takes a tumble. Habitat destruction is something we’re surely all aware of – we’ve all seen the heartbreaking footage of animals left stranded in tiny patches of forest, surrounded by roads and industry. Beyond the Trees reinforces its ecological message through its visuals and through play, and though this might not be many players’ introduction to this pressing real-world issue, it is a new way to look at it, and a new way to engender sympathy. Developer Broken Rules has done its research here, both on the creatures themselves and the places they call home. No matter how many people feel moved to donate to conservation charities after playing, this game will have made a difference through its advocacy.

5/19/2022,"Mozambique has identified its first case of wild polio in three decades following the genetic sequencing of a similar strain of the childhood disease in Malawi earlier this year. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization’s regional director for Africa, said the detection of the new case was “greatly concerning” and that it demonstrated “how dangerous this virus is and how quickly it can spread”. Africa was declared free of indigenous wild polio in 2020, and the latest case would not affect that certification as it appeared to be an imported strain, the WHO said. Polio eradication has been one of the great global health success stories and wild poliovirus is now endemic only in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The case in Mozambique, identified in the north-eastern Tete province, is the first since 1992, with the infected child having begun to experience the onset of paralysis in late March. Genomic sequencing analysis indicated that the newly confirmed case was linked to a strain that circulatied in Pakistan in 2019, similar to the case reported in Malawi earlier this year. Ahmed Ogwell Ouma, the deputy director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, said: “When sequenced, that particular case [in Mozambique] had very close similarities to the case that had been reported in Malawi some weeks back.” In February, Malawi declared its first case of wild poliovirus in 30 years, when a three-year old girl in the Lilongwe district was paralysed as a result of her infection. An investigation is under way in Mozambique to determine the extent of the risk posed by the new case, and the targeted responses needed. Preliminary analysis of samples collected from three contacts of the newly detected case were all negative for wild poliovirus type 1, the WHO said. Mozambique recently carried out two mass vaccination campaigns – in response to the Malawi case – in which 4.2 million children were vaccinated against the disease. Polio is a highly infectious disease, spread mainly through oral contamination by faecal matter. The virus can cause paralysis, which is sometimes fatal. There is no cure, but vaccination has brought the world close to ending the wild form of the disease.",News/Society,Mozambique confirms first wild poliovirus case in 30 years,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/mozambique-polio-wild-poliovirus-case-malawi
5/19/2022,"Born in Kabul, Afghanistan, and later building a life in Ukraine, Ruhullah Haji has been displaced by war twice in 34 years. So when the heart surgeon made it to Britain after fleeing Russia’s invasion, he was desperate for security and the right to remain as a Ukrainian. Many other Afghans have struggled to secure such rights since the fall of Kabul last year, and remain in limbo. Haji’s application to the Ukrainian family scheme was accepted on Thursday, about a month after he applied and a day after the Guardian approached the Home Office about his case. However, his lawyer said a decision for his wife and daughter has yet to come. It marks the end of a long and arduous road. A week after Ukraine was invaded in February, Haji crossed the Polish border alone in search of his wife and child who had already fled. At the border, he said he was treated differently. Other BAME refugees have reported similar experiences. “Because they [volunteers] saw me: that I’m not white and I don’t have green eyes and I’m not blond,” said Haji, who waited at the border for three days with no belongings. “But … I serve for Ukraine more than [many] Ukrainians.” He then travelled by train from Poland through Romania, Hungary, Austria and Germany over two days in search of his family, before flying to the UK. “I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t drink, I was just walking and running, in two days,” he said. Haji had left Afghanistan for Ukraine in his teens to join his older brother. He studied Russian, adding a seventh language to his arsenal, and completed his medical degree to become a heart surgeon. He also held language classes for more than 100 Afghan refugees, worked as a refugee doctor across the Odesa region where the family lived, and later founded a clinic of his own. After reuniting with his family in Britain in March, they visited the Home Office and the following day were sent to a hotel in Blackpool to await news of their asylum application. Haji’s solicitor, Nicola Burgess of the Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit, has been helping Haji’s family, and others who have applied for asylum, switch to existing Ukrainian schemes. Burgess recognises that without the Ukrainian scheme, the family would be stuck in a hotel without the right to work – the experience of many Afghans. “If you just had to flee a war zone, you have been subjected to trauma. And if you’re stuck in a box room hotel, it is going to have a negative effect on a person.” The Ukraine schemes have operated with significant delays. Burgess said: “Ruhullah is a refugee automatically, it should be a more straightforward process … They’re fleeing a war zone, there should be an automatic grant of some type of leave to remain rather than some drawn-out process.” Haji walks and jogs to stay motivated. He has started visiting a nearby library to keep on top of his studies, and the British Medical Association has recently accepted his credentials. “Of course, I would like to go back, but now I’m a father and I have my small child, I should think about my family more than myself, than about my people who cannot live under the bombs, because we have as Afghans, we have this experience,” Haji said. “In war there is no loser, there is no winner.” A UK government spokesperson said that after launching one of the “fastest and biggest visa schemes in the UK history”, over 102,000 visas for Ukrainians to live and work in the UK have been granted. “The changes the Home Office has made to streamline the visa system, including simplifying the forms and boosting staff numbers, are working and we are now processing visas as quickly as they come in – enabling thousands more Ukrainians to come through our uncapped routes.”",News/World news,Afghan surgeon who fled Ukraine says he was treated differently at Polish border,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/afghan-surgeon-who-fled-ukraine-says-he-was-treated-differently-at-polish-border
5/19/2022,"A Scottish Greens MSP has launched a member’s bill at Holyrood to designate protest-free buffer zones outside abortion clinics as healthcare professionals and campaigners call for immediate action in the face of growing anti-abortion activity. Launching the public consultation that begins the bill process, Gillian Mackay MSP said on Thursday that, while urgency was at the heart of the bill, it was also critical that any proposal be robust, after a similar bill for Northern Ireland was referred to the UK supreme court earlier this month. Clare Murphy, the chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, welcomed Mackay’s plans as a “simple solution to a growing problem”. Back Off Scotland, a student-led campaign that has spearheaded the push for these zones, said it hoped the roundtable summit promised by Nicola Sturgeon last week would yield short-term stopgap measures. “With this increasing activity we need to move forward quickly,” said Dr Audrey Brown, a consultant in sexual and reproductive healthcare and the chair of the Scottish Abortion Care Providers Group, noting “a definite escalation” in recent months. “This is not a party political issue, it’s about healthcare.” Last week, Brown was working at the Sandyford clinic, near Glasgow city centre, which offers sexual health services to rape victims among others, when it was targeted by a small group of protesters with no visible group affiliation. “I’ve never seen anything like that before,” she said. “They had a mic with an amplifier and were extremely verbally abusive to both staff and patients.” She recalled one protester shouting in her face: “You’ll be at the gates of hell with all the foetuses you’ve murdered lying before you.” At Glasgow’s Queen Elizabeth university hospital, which has been the focus of prayer vigils by the Texas-based group 40 days for Life since 2016, the consultant paediatric radiologist Dr Greg Irwin said: “I am mystified as to why the Scottish government is not acting on this more quickly, when it has cross-party and public support.” Irwin, who last month wrote a letter signed by 76 QEUH colleagues asking the women’s health minister, Maree Todd, to “show courage” over buffer zones, spoke outside the maternity unit and opposite a group of 40 Days for Life supporters, gathered for their weekly prayer vigil on Tuesday. He said they were strategically placed at the point in the road where cars must slow down to turn into the main hospital grounds. “They can see right into the vehicles, and if patients are coming by public transport then they have to walk past them from the bus stop. They are bullying people. “The primary feeling I have, and one I share with colleagues, is anger at what they are doing to our patients. I want women to know that this hospital is filled with professionals of all grades who will look after and support them. Whatever decision they take, we are on their side,” he said. The group of eight people held placards reading “women do regret abortion” and “pray to end abortion”, with pictures of foetuses in the womb, and prayed and sang together. Approached by the Guardian, they refused to answer questions about their presence, saying “we are here to pray”. Robert Colquhoun, the international campaigns director for the group, said there was no significant increase in activity in Scotland, but that a recent increase in media visibility had drawn the regular vigils to public attention. Last week, a campaign called Compassion Scotland was launched to oppose what it describes as “censorship zones”. The spokesperson Hannah McNicol said the group was independent, with no affiliation with, nor funding from, any other religious or political organisation. McNicol said “peaceful gatherings” happening across Scotland did not amount to harassment and that it would be an “egregious breach of fundamental human rights” to prevent them. “Women seek abortions for many reasons and can often be under immense pressure to do so – whether that be financial and employment pressures or coercion from a partner or family member. The peaceful presence of volunteers signposting practical support and counsel has been a lifeline in the past to women who feel they have no choice but an abortion.” But Alice Murray, who encountered 40 Days for Life outside Chalmers Street clinic in Edinburgh when she went for abortion care in October 2019, described a very different experience. “They were handing out leaflets and standing in silent prayer, but it was still intimidating having loads of strangers watching you. You feel very targeted, even though they are not shouting at you.” Murray, who went on to co-found Back Off Scotland, added: “When I got inside the staff were really helpful. It wasn’t just medical information but asking if this is right for you, did anyone pressure you, all the stuff that the people outside think you don’t get told. But when I was in there, I was thinking I would have to go past them again.”",News/UK news,Scottish Greens launch bill to create protest-free zones outside abortion clinics,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/scottish-greens-launch-bill-to-create-protest-free-zones-outside-abortion-clinics
5/19/2022,"Another triumph for Boris Johnson’s Houdini act. Partygate appears over with today’s announcement that the Metropolitan police has closed the file on Downing Street parties, with 126 penalty notices and reportedly no more for the prime minister. Rumours are that Sue Gray’s separate report on the parties will be published next week, but it is hard to see what it is likely to add, or what will come from the continuing inquiry into whether the prime minister “misled parliament”. Johnson’s tactic of devolving judgment to a dilatory police force has worked, albeit at the cost of £460,000. What appeared last December to be a resignation issue has been kicked down the road so many times as to disappear from view. Like all high-profile political sagas, Partygate looks like one of those transient Westminster storms more seismic at the time than in retrospect. It stands with other “affairs”, such as Profumo, Westland, Formula One and Cheriegate in the canon of moments when the strictures of Westminster seemed to usurp those of the electorate. They display De Tocqueville’s truth about British politics, that its ethos is that of a club not of a mob. Leaders are at most short-term risk when they offend the club, not the people. The breaking of lockdown rules by Downing Street in 2020 infuriated the British public. It had been asked to suffer social privation on an unprecedented scale and did so only after the most explicit insistence from the prime minister that it was for the greater good. It led to extreme misery and suffering during a desperately difficult time for all. It also led to many cases where people did not follow the stricter – admittedly often sillier – rules. When Johnson was himself found guilty of this, public anger was understandable. It was exacerbated by his display of habitual mendacity under pressure and his clear belief that he could waffle and stall his way out of trouble. In this he was helped by Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine, which he exploited outrageously, and by an unfortunate slip by Labour’s Keir Starmer, his prime tormenter, caught drinking a bottle of beer in an office. Starmer was duly goaded by the rightwing press into Beergate, and a promise to resign if found to have erred likewise. Since then, much water has flowed past the walls of Westminster. Johnson has had to sack a half dozen of his closest advisers. He has also paid a predictably heavy price at the May local elections. But the heat has been waning. Forecasts that the May election would end his stay of execution for Partygate were false. Time was the healer. As of now, Johnson can plead that he still has the “misleading parliament” inquiry to pass judgment, and that is expected to be under Tory acting chairmanship. For the time being, Johnson’s cabinet or parliamentary party seem unlikely to summon a leadership election to eject him. Any cabinet colleague suspected of disloyalty can expect to vanish in a summer reshuffle. Partygate is over and, in all common decency, the Durham police, de facto collaborators in Johnson’s escapology, should also end Starmer’s torment. His “crime” was footling in comparison with Johnson’s. The irony of politics is the deeper the mess into which a leader takes his country, the more secure he probably is in the short term. The prime minister stumbles from mess to mess, each one somehow overriding the last. Partygate now seems trivial against the shambles of Johnson’s Northern Ireland protocol, where his past ineptitude remains critically in need of resolution. Yet that, too, seems in just a week to have given way to its successor, the cost of living crisis. Here again, the impression is of a leader fumbling for policy options, with a team of B-grade ministers all nervous for their jobs. It is hard to recall a time when the British economy was in worse custodianship just when it most needed the best. As so often in Johnson’s career, all that matters is the now. His judgment is fixed not on interest rates or taxes, energy prices or health spending, Brexit or Ukraine. It is fixed on opinion polls, headlines, press leaks, tearoom gossip and letters to the 1922 Committee. The clouds of Partygate may have cleared and Johnson may be free, but one thing is certain of this prime minister. When one cloud clears, another is on the horizon. Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,"The clouds of Partygate may part for Johnson, but there will be another one along soon | Simon Jenkins",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/19/partygate-boris-johnson-mess-national-affairs
5/19/2022,"There is near euphoria, currently, among supporters of Ukraine at the continued military reverses it is inflicting on Russian forces. But the truth is that Ukraine has a long way to go before it can achieve any kind of acceptable outcome from this war – and the going will get harder the closer it seems to come to victory. It’s not just the large areas of territory under Russian control, where Ukraine still has to fight to relieve the suffering of its citizens under a savage military occupation. It’s also the political and economic aspects of the war, which have been so often overlooked in the day-to-day tactical detail of Russia’s often self-inflicted military disasters. The economic impact of the war is now getting more attention, not only the continual pounding of Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure by long-range missiles, but also the global effects of Ukrainian exports being blockaded by Russia – exports that include food supplies vital for other regions. There’s been plenty of talk of who will fund reconstruction of Ukraine after the war. But there is a more urgent question: how can Ukraine’s vital role in feeding the world can be preserved? And that economic stranglehold by Russia presents an additional political challenge to Ukraine in continuing the war. There is already pressure on Kyiv to make concessions to Moscow, and it will only increase as the broader economic impact hits home. Should Ukraine advance beyond the line of control before the invasion, and liberate occupied Crimea, this will present its backers with further serious questions. But that is no excuse for suggestions that Ukraine should give the aggressor a piece of its territory for the sake of Vladimir Putin’s peace of mind. Ukraine’s military successes are continuing, bolstered by more and more of its western backers – with the continuing exception of some major EU states – overcoming their reluctance to help. But many of those successes still seem to be as much a function of Russian failures of military competence as of Ukrainian prowess. This shouldn’t be relied on to continue indefinitely. As the war grinds on – and Putin has already belied predictions that he would seek a means of ending it by Russia’s Victory Day – it shouldn’t be ruled out that Russia may eventually arrive at a more sensible use for what military resources and manpower it has left. The Russian military commentator and retired colonel Mikhail Khodarenok has received widespread attention for his critiques on Russian state television of the conduct of the campaign and the state of the Russian military. For now, Khodarenok is filling the role of a court jester or holy fool for Russia, occasionally permitted to speak the truth when all about him are still repeating the official lies. The reasons why he has been permitted to do so are as yet unclear, but some seasoned Russia-watchers are wondering if this suggests the prospect of a shaking-out of Russia’s military or even the conduct of the war overall. And there are other vital needs for Ukraine that will be even harder to achieve than pushing back the Russian army. By Russia’s own count, over 1 million Ukrainians have been removed to remote areas of Russia, in a horrifying echo of the deportation programmes of the 20th century – where “deportation” was a sanitised euphemism for enslavement. The war will not be over for Ukraine until it has recovered its people – many of them highly likely to be held hostage by Russia as leverage once the fighting is notionally over, in the same way that Moscow held tens of thousands of British and American prisoners of war as bargaining chips long after the end of the second world war. As realisation of the costs of backing Ukraine sets in across Europe, and the war drags on with the looming prospect of another winter with vicious increases in energy prices, support for Ukraine to fight on may dwindle among western EU leaders and their publics. That will be an ongoing challenge not only for Ukraine, but also for those of its backers who see clearly that this is not just Ukraine’s war – and that it is vital that Putin does not come away from this venture thinking that it has been anything other than a catastrophic strategic blunder. Keir Giles works with the Russia and Eurasia programme of Chatham House.

5/19/2022,"If only the Ukraine war came to an end. If only energy prices dropped. If only Covid’s long tail finally dwindled away. Then, at last, food price inflation would be vanquished. It’s certainly true that if and when these things happen the rate at which food prices are increasing, currently at 5.9% and rising, should ease. It’s worth noting that there is also significant food price inflation across the EU right now. In Belgium it’s 5.3%, in Germany it’s 6.2% and in Greece it’s a whacking 8.1%. So we’re the same as everywhere else. Except we’re not. For underlying all those short-term issues, is a much longer term systemic issue peculiar to the UK; one which this government seems determined to ignore. A decade ago, I was writing Greedy Man In A Hungry World, my book about food sustainability and whether it had much to do with middle-class obsessions with small-scale agriculture, organics and localism (spoiler: it doesn’t). I argued then that massive damage had been done to the UK’s agricultural base by the pursuit of cheap food by any means. I am not, by reflex, anti-supermarket. Mass retail has gifted us an awful lot. But there’s also no doubt that the huge purchasing power of these corporate behemoths has undermined farming’s viability. In 2012 we produced only 60% of the food we ate, nearer 50% after exports, and down from the high 70s in the 1990s, and UK farmers were quitting the business. The big retailers assumed they could fill the gaps by buying from abroad, despite the fact that emerging economies like China and India were now competing with us. I argued then that if we didn’t start paying a little more for our food to help improve our self-sufficiency, we would end up paying substantially more in the future when an external shock restricted our supply from overseas. Cut to 2022. Nothing has changed. We still only produce 60% of what we consume. Exports have dropped slightly but only because of that shock, which turned out to be self-inflicted: Brexit. We no longer have enough workers to harvest all our crops. Some rot in the fields, because of Brexit. We do not have enough meat processors, meaning pigs are being culled without going into the food chain, because of Brexit. Last month Jacob Rees-Mogg, the minister for imaginary Brexit opportunities, announced the UK would continue to suspend the introduction of checks on food coming into the country, checks that protect the very integrity of food supply, because of Brexit. If we produced more of our own food, all of this would be less of a problem, but we don’t. And what is the government doing to sort that? Right now, nothing. In the flawed, Henry Dimbleby-led national food strategy there was next to nothing on food production (though instead of proposing that the root causes of poverty be dealt with, it suggested GPs prescribe fresh fruit). According to sources close to Defra, the delays to the long-awaited white paper on the UK’s food supply were caused by arguments over whether any food production targets should be included. Food inflation in France is lower, at 3.8%. France also happens to be self-sufficient in food. Last month, the president of NFU Scotland, Martin Kennedy, warned that the UK is on the verge of a food security crisis not seen since the second world war. We need to support domestic food production, he said, “or run the risk of not having domestic production to support”. Don’t want to take my word for it? Take his.

5/19/2022,"My son sat on the stairs of our home crying on Monday, and for once I had no more words. I could not justify my decision to not cook his tiny, budget pizza beyond that of making sure we practised being poorer. I didn’t feel able to cook it because it would cost too much to turn the oven on for this one small thing. My 12-year-old son has additional needs and significant sensory processing issues. He has not been in school for almost five months and I am his full-time, unpaid carer. I am currently claiming universal credit. Right now, I am furiously paddling to stay afloat and trying to stay far enough away from the edge financially that we don’t lose our home. But even that is not a given. We have already lost enough, and we are two of many – many millions, in fact – who are struggling right now. As inflation reaches a 40-year high, we feel its impact directly, and we are struggling. Struggling with the fast rise in the cost of living, which feels completely out of control. Struggling because almost every essential part of our budget is spiralling out of control – from the cost of our shopping to our energy bills and high rents from often unscrupulous landlords. But what truly terrifies me is that we are only going to get poorer. I struggle to sleep at night, knowing things are only going to get harder. Perhaps peace of mind, too, should be seen as another luxury millions of us can no longer afford. I have seen our gas and electricity charges double. We have just had our toughest winter yet as I couldn’t afford to turn on the heating. Instead, we bundled up in bed to stay warm. There is now a minimum of a third less in my shopping basket for the same money. It’s largely fresh food we are cutting back on, short shelf-life items, tiny luxuries and toiletries too, but even that won’t be enough soon. We are pretty savvy shoppers, people who are used to life on a low income, but this is absolutely impossible to manage and we cannot plan for this as costs continue to rise, and a terrifying winter comes into view. We watch in disbelief as the government continues to fail to support families like mine, as we are told by politicians that food-bank users just need to learn how to cook, or those in working poverty just need to get better-paid jobs. How dare they gloss over rising food-bank use as if it’s normal in one of the richest countries in the world. How dare those in power tell us how to spend the appallingly low budgets we receive on social security while we perform the mental gymnastics of just getting through the day on 500 calories. Crying because we know how living in this way will affect our children, how deadly poverty can be for vulnerable people and older people among us. We are making generations of hungry people feel that it is their fault, and after two years of unprecedented strain, people are losing hope at a time when we need it the most. Becoming poorer hurts. It physically hurts us. Your body tenses so much in the cold that everything aches. You wake up freezing in the night, bringing pain to tired muscles and arthritic bones. My son cried more than once last winter because he was cold. It hurts your fingers and feet and it stops you knowing what is true illness and what is deprivation. In the end, it makes you ill anyway. It mentally hurts us too. It scars us in invisible ways to hear our government, and those who are much better off financially, tell us to manage better. As if that is all that is needed. I am sick of wasting the precious years I have with my son explaining that we just can’t do things or have things. And he’s not immune to the worry, he knows the worst is to come. Poverty hurts him now, and will continue to do so long into the future. The stigma of living like this stops those suffering from speaking out. After all, who wants to be lambasted in public for being poor? An inadequate, stigmatising and impersonal social security system means we too often feel that this is all that we deserve. But I’m not ashamed to speak out. I don’t want my son and the millions of other children living like this to ever believe they are not worthy of more. Told by those who are paid vast sums of money to make the rules and to wisely use the budgets they are afforded by the public in times of great need, that this is all they are worth. My son’s response about the tiny pizza was tears and rage at the inequality of it all. As staff at energy companies receive millions in bonuses, we can’t afford to heat a budget pizza. When I said to him that that this is why we need to speak out and help people, he told me through his rage: “I can’t help the people mummy, I am the people.” And he is right, we are the people you must listen to. We know how to budget and how to cook and we will never give up fighting for our rightful place at the table as decisions continue to be made on our behalf.
