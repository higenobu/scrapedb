3/10/2022,"High-profile victims of online trolling, including Erin Molan and Nyadol Nyuon, have said an “anti-trolling” bill that overhauls defamation law for online comments will be “almost impossible” to uptake and not “useful” to most people in Australia due to the cost and effort involved. The bill will make the owners of social media pages and groups not liable for user comments on those groups or pages, and would shift the liability burden to social media platforms if they do not attempt to facilitate the unmasking of anonymous commenters for someone seeking to bring defamation proceedings. The majority of those who have made submissions about the bill have said the bill is incorrectly titled, because it does not target trolling. However, the media personality Erin Molan, the former Broncos NRL coach Anthony Seibold, and the prominent African Australian lawyer and chair of Harmony Alliance, Nyadol Nyuon, were called before the inquiry to give evidence about the trolling they had endured online. When the Labor senator Kim Carr asked each of them whether they would pursue defamation action under the bill, they all said it was not something they would consider. Molan, who told the committee she walked away from covering rugby league due to the abuse she copped online since she was on The Footy Show, said it is incredibly difficult to launch defamation proceedings. “I went through a defamation trial last year … against a member of the mainstream media and it’s an experience you wouldn’t wish on your worst enemy,” Molan said, referencing her high-profile case against the Daily Mail over allegations she is racist. “I earn an above-average salary absolutely, and it is crippling, the cost of it … My experience and my belief would be that for 99.9% of Australians it would be absolutely impossible to afford when the cost of living is already hard enough, for people to get a lawyer and take action.” Siebold says he had not considered pursuing defamation action and drawing more attention to his online abuse. “It would be significant … it’s not something I’ve thought deeply about since the time it happened, which is about 18 months,” he said. “Myself and my family had been through significant pain.” Nyuon said she endures constant racist abuse online, but the sheer volume of it would make it difficult to pursue any sort of action.

I receive a lot of online abuse from a lot of anonymous trolls … If I was to dedicate my time to it, it would be unmanageable.” Nyuon argued more resources should be provided to the eSafety commissioner, which is already empowered to require social media companies to provide basic subscriber information to the commissioner in cases where there is serious online bullying of adults. The commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, told the inquiry that the bill had created “conflation, confusion, and oversimplification” about where Australians can turn to in order to address issues of online defamation. Since the adult cyber abuse scheme came into effect at the end of January, the eSafety commissioner’s office has received 500 complaints, one-third of which Inman Grant said were more defamation complaints than cyberbullying. She said those people had no place to turn, and her office did not have the resources to deal with the “absolute flood” of defamation complaints. “Conflating defamation with trolling is comparing apples with oranges. Not only does this catch-all term trolling trivialise seriously harmful forms of online abuse, you can troll someone endlessly without defaming them,” she said. “You could change the name of the bill and it would deal with a lot of confusion and conflation.” Inman Grant has not used any of the takedown notice or subscriber information request powers under the Online Safety Act in the two months since it came into effect, and said the government should give the law time to work. Carr pointed out that although some government senators on the committee had argued online defamation required “urgent” legislative action, the bill is unlikely to pass before the election, with just three sitting days expected before the election is called.",News/Society,"Erin Molan, Nyadol Nyuon tell inquiry defamation bill not ‘useful’ for most online trolling victims",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/10/erin-molan-nyadol-nyuon-tell-inquiry-defamation-bill-not-useful-for-most-online-trolling-victims
3/10/2022,"The judge presiding over the murder trial of Northern Territory constable Zachary Rolfe has urged the jury to ignore emotion or sympathy that may have arisen during confronting evidence in the case when they consider their verdict. Judge John Burns gave the jury his directions in the supreme court on Thursday. The jurors have now retired to consider their verdict after an almost five-week trial. Rolfe, 30, has been charged with murder and alternative charges of manslaughter or engaging in a violent act causing death. The alternative charges are only considered by the jury in the event that Rolfe is found not guilty of the more serious charges. The court has heard Rolfe shot Kumanjayi Walker, a 19-year-old Warlpiri man, while trying to arrest him in the remote community of Yuendumu, about 300km from Alice Springs, on 9 November 2019. Walker stabbed Rolfe with scissors prior to the first shot being fired. This shot was not subject to any charges. But the court heard that 2.6 seconds after the first shot, Rolfe fired again, and then 0.5 seconds later he fired a third time. These final two shots were fired from close range at a time when Rolfe’s partner, then constable Adam Eberl, was attempting to restrain Walker on a mattress. The prosecution alleges Walker no longer posed a threat to Rolfe or Eberl at that stage. The defence says Rolfe acted reasonably to protect against the threat to himself and Eberl, who Rolfe says he believed Walker was attempting to stab. Burns told the jury that although the confronting nature of the evidence in the case could arouse strong emotions, they should “guard against” that. “You must not let emotion or sympathy affect your verdicts,” he said. Burns told the jury that the prosecution had to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Rolfe did not hold an honest belief that it was necessary for him to fire the second and third shots in order to protect Eberl, and that firing the shots was not a reasonable response in the circumstances, as Rolfe perceived them. Burns said the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that firing the shots was unreasonable, in the circumstances as Rolfe perceived them to be, for Rolfe to perform his duty as a police officer. The crown must also prove that Rolfe did not honestly believe, when he fired the second and third shots, that this was reasonably necessary to perform his duty or function as a police officer. Burns said that if the jury were not convinced about the prosecution’s case in relation to any of these defences, then they must find Rolfe not guilty of all charges. To reiterate this, he drew the jury’s attention to comments made by prosector Philip Strickland SC on Wednesday that if they believed Rolfe’s evidence that he had perceived Walker to be stabbing Eberl at the time of the shooting, they must find him not guilty. Burns said it was important for them to understand the distinction between perception of events and reality in hindsight. To demonstrate this, Burns provided an example of a police officer who shot a bank robber after seeing them threatening a teller with a gun, only to discover after the shooting that the robber was armed with a replica firearm. As the police officer perceived the gun to be real when he shot the bank robber, he would be protected from criminal prosecution, Burns said. “The important question may well turn out to be what was the perception, rather than the reality,” he said. Burns also reiterated that despite the extensive evidence about Rolfe’s training and the events leading up to the shooting, he was charged with criminal offences, not a police regulatory offence about failing to follow orders or not acting in accordance with his training. He also said that despite the jury having seen extensive footage of the shooting they should “guard against” considering it as an event broken down into tenths or one hundredths of a second, rather than as a “single extremely brief and violent incident”. The jury foreperson informed the court that if they had not reached a verdict by Friday they did not intend to deliberate over the weekend but would resume on Monday.",News/Australia news,Judge urges jurors to ‘guard against’ emotion when considering verdict in Zachary Rolfe murder trial,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/10/judge-urges-jurors-to-guard-against-emotion-when-considering-verdict-in-zachary-rolfe-trial
3/10/2022,"The scale of the destruction in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol at the hands of Russian forces has emerged in new satellite images that show devastated residential building, blasted parklands and smouldering grocery stores. Shown alongside images from before the invasion, the pictures paint a bleak picture of the damage done so far to the besieged city, which Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy described as “ultimate evidence that genocide of Ukrainians is happening” in the wake of the shelling of a maternity hospital. The city’s deputy mayor, Sergiy Orlov, told reporters of several civilian targets hit so far, including numerous residential houses, a children’s and maternity hospital, the main administration service building, and the city’s giant Avostal metallurgical factory. Orlov said 1,160 people had been killed already, with 47 buried on Wednesday alone. About 200,000 people want to get out of the city, but with humanitarian corridors shelled, only around 2,000 to 3,000 are able to leave a day. The first image, taken by private company Maxar, shows the extensive damage done to grocery stores and a shopping mall in the city, with both buildings smouldering under the intense shelling Another photo reveals the damage done to residential areas, where many residents are without power, heat, water or communications for over a week. Some of the buildings have been entirely destroyed. Another image shows swathes of residential houses destroyed, with neighbouring parkland appearing to be scorched. What appears to be an apartment block on the left edge is heavily damaged. Another comparative image shows the damage done to malls and shopping centres, with the roof of the central building partially collapsed and the interior exposed. The worst of the shelling has been coming in the city’s west, with the Red Cross describing conditions in the city as “apocalyptic”, while deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said the situation was “catastrophic”. In the call with journalists, Orlov called the siege “pure genocide”. “They have used aviation, artillery, multiple rocket launchers, grads and other types of weapons we don’t even know about. This isn’t simply treacherous. It’s a war crime and pure genocide,” he said.",News/World news,Mariupol bombing: before and after satellite images show destruction in Ukraine city,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/mariupol-bombing-ukraine-before-and-after-satellite-images-map-russian-attack-residential-maternity-childrens-hospital
3/10/2022,"A United Nations monitoring trip to the Great Barrier Reef will land in Queensland later this month just as forecasts suggest the risk of widespread coral bleaching will be at its highest. Unesco has confirmed two scientists will carry out the mission, requested by the Morrison government, lasting for 10 days from 21 March. Forecasting from the US government’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) shows the visit could coincide with the reef being at risk of widespread bleaching. Environment groups told the Guardian while they were not aware of any details of the itinerary, it was vital the scientists were allowed to see any bleaching for themselves. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority reported late last week that “low to moderate bleaching” had already been reported in many areas. The reef authority said significant heat stress had accumulated in some parts of the far north of the reef, as well as between Townsville and Rockhampton. “The Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting sea surface temperatures to remain above average throughout most of the marine park in the coming weeks,” the authority said. The 2,300km reef has seen five mass bleaching events – in 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2020 – all caused by rising ocean temperatures driven by global heating. Corals can recover from mild bleaching if cooler conditions return quickly. Coral cover over the reef has risen in the last 18 months after benign conditions, but the Australian Institute of Marine Science has said this recovery is dominated by fast-growing corals susceptible to bleaching. Dr William Skirving, of Noaa’s Coral Reef Watch, said the accumulation of heat stress had paused during most of February, but had now returned. Without clouds and cooler weather, Skirving said there was a risk of bleaching from the Whitsundays to the northern tip of the reef by the last week of March. But he said it was unclear how much the cloud cover in February had benefited the corals because the amount of sunlight, as well as the level of heat, were both important in translating the heat stress into bleaching. The Morrison government requested the Unesco mission last year after it successfully lobbied against UN scientific advice that the reef should be placed on a list of world heritage sites in danger. Unesco said the visit was confirmed by letter to the Australian government on 21 February, but there had been no official announcement of the visit. One expert from Unesco and another from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) would travel to the reef. Unesco declined to provide any details about where the scientists would visit, as did the office of the environment minister, Sussan Ley. A report from the mission is expected to be completed by early May ahead of a scheduled meeting of the 21-country world heritage committee in June. The Morrison government has argued the reef is being singled out, and that world heritage sites should not be placed on the in danger list because of impacts from climate change. The head of oceans at WWF Australia, Richard Leck, said Unesco advisers had last year recommended the reef be listed as “in danger” primarily because of concerns about the impacts of global heating. “It is absolutely vital that if there is a bleaching event, that these experts are witness to the impacts of coral bleaching,” Leck said. “WWF fervently hopes there won’t be a bleaching event, but if it does occur every effort should be made so that Unesco and IUCN are witness to that.” He said WWF Australia had made a formal request to the government to brief the mission while it was in the country. “We have also spoken directly to representatives of IUCN who are very keen to meet with non-governmental organisations, scientists and civil society,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Dr Lissa Schindler, a reef campaigner at the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said she expected an itinerary that ensured “the visiting delegates gain a true picture of how seriously impacted our reef is by the climate crisis, water pollution and poor fishing practices, and what the solutions are.” Schindler said there had not yet been an invitation to non-government groups to speak with the mission, “so we are concerned they will not be presented with a true picture of what is happening on our reef”. Prof Terry Hughes, a leading coral reef researcher at James Cook University, said the scientists should visit coalmines and export terminals along the reef “to see for themselves the scale of fossil fuel exports across the reef”. “They should look at the causes of the decline of the reef,” he said. The Guardian had reported that in the latest major UN climate report, the Morrison government unsuccessfully attempted to insert a sentence saying the reef was not in crisis. A spokesperson for the environment minister said: “The world heritage committee will be given every opportunity to satisfy its requirements. “The mission is being planned in collaboration with the world heritage centre and the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.”",News/Environment,Unesco to visit Great Barrier Reef as coral bleaching risk rises,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/10/unesco-to-visit-great-barrier-reef-as-bleaching-risk-rises
3/10/2022,"This time was going to be different; we were prepared. I felt proud of us as I witnessed the entire Lismore CBD packing up, lifting things to above the 12.12m record, ready to brace for what happened just under five years ago. We all had a flood plan. We moved our cars higher up. But this time was different: it broke all records, and it’s broken our town. A friend said to me as I plugged my phone into my emergency power pack, taking refuge in the roof cavity of my home in South Lismore: “Don’t worry mate, the army have arrived, shouldn’t be too long.” That was the early hours of Monday morning on 28 February. We hadn’t slept as we watched the water engulf our home. We had called 000 and the State Emergency Service, with no luck – they were overwhelmed. We heard the evacuation centre was already full as we tried to work out where we would go once we got out. We had more than 10 people on the outside attempting to get us boats. We waited more than six hours as the storm raged on the other side of the tin roof half a foot from my face. We were saved by a man, a civilian named Brad on a jetski who had travelled in from Ballina. I caught his attention by banging on a window neck-deep in flood water – the only safe exit. We didn’t see one SES boat on the way out as we ducked below power lines to safety. This week, on day nine, I saw my first army officer clearing out a primary school. The Liberal government has failed us. They can’t even face us. Wednesday was our “leader’s” opportunity to experience what our people have endured over the last nine days – it was his opportunity to listen. Instead Scott Morrison thinks it acceptable to throw money at a problem in the hope it will go away, then fly out of the site for his next curated media coverage. He placed a ban on media filming the visit, his office says out of respect for victims, but conveniently it would also conceal the response he must have known he would be met with – an admission of guilt. His visit feels more like a bad case of Mondayitis than a genuine wish to help taxpaying Australians whose lives have been destroyed. We heard of SES ranks being thinned because of vaccine requirements; the army were staging media shots which appeared on Morrison’s Instagram to broadcast what a great job they were doing, uniforms mud-free. Civilians were chartering helicopters to get us essential items like clean water, food and fuel. On Wednesday more than 200 northern rivers people showed up to communicate what our community needs, to seek answers for the inadequate and fatal response. Scotty slipped in the back door of the council chambers – he did not face the group of passionate yet peaceful protesters. Instead he once again left us high and dry to “dig deep and help one another”, with a couple of grand and nowhere to spend it. We don’t need the disaster relief agency boss blaming “people who want to live among the gum trees” for the place we choose to call home. We will not fall into the river without first dismantling the true problem: those who profit from the decisions which contribute to the reality I and 90% of my community find ourselves in … again! I don’t know how we will bounce back from this. You can massage the narrative all you want but THIS IS WHAT CLIMATE CHANGE LOOKS LIKE. This is what happens when we don’t commit to a global effort to combat the climate crisis. This is Lismore’s second natural disaster in five years. This is the whole coastline in devastation. It’s not “getting harder to live in Australia”, it’s getting harder to live with the decisions of our past generations who have refused to listen to climate scientists and the Indigenous elders, who warned us this is where we were headed long before I was born. It’s getting harder to swallow the blundered responses Scotty vomits with zero thought, consideration or compassion. We are deeply disappointed in the lack of leadership. We will not be fed this mediocre deflection of accountability. The current government doesn’t care about us; Morrison let this be known to the northern rivers community loudly on Wednesday with his cowardly silence. We are not an inconvenience. We are humans who demand inspiring, honest leadership. We demand more.
