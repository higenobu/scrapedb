12/30/2021,"A federal judge has refused to dismiss an indictment charging four alleged Proud Boys leaders of conspiracy and obstructing an official proceeding during the 6 January attack on the US Capitol – a development that could have potential implications for Donald Trump. On Tuesday, US district judge Timothy Kelly rejected arguments by defence lawyers that Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs, Zachary Rehl and Charles Donohoe are charged with conduct that is protected by the First Amendment right to free speech.  He said they had multiple nonviolent options to express their opinions about the 2020 presidential election, in which former president Trump lost to Joe Biden. “Defendants are not, as they argue, charged with anything like burning flags, wearing black armbands, or participating in mere sit-ins or protests,” he wrote in a 43-page ruling. “Moreover, even if the charged conduct had some expressive aspect, it lost whatever First Amendment protection it may have had.” As reported by the Guardian last week, expectation is growing that Trump might face charges for trying to obstruct Congress from certifying Biden’s election this year as a House panel is collecting more evidence into the attack. Evidence against the former president could include his involvement in the “Stop the Steal” rally near the White House where he called on supporters to march to the Capitol and “fight like hell [or] you’re not going to have a country any more”. Federal prosecutors have so far cited the obstruction statute in about 200 cases involving rioters charged by the Department of Justice for their involvement in the attack, supported by recent rulings by Trump-appointed district court judges. Nordean, Biggs, Rehl and Donohoe, who are jailed while they await a trial scheduled for May, were indicted in March on charges including conspiracy and obstructing an official proceeding. Nordean, from Auburn, Washington, was a Proud Boys chapter president and member of its national “elders council”. Biggs, from Ormond Beach, Florida, is a self-described Proud Boys organiser. Rehl was president of the group’s chapter in Philadelphia and Donohoe, from Kernersville, North Carolina, was president of his local chapter, according to the indictment. Defence lawyers also argued that the obstruction charge is not applicable to their clients’ cases because they claimed that the certification of the electoral college by Congress was not an “official proceeding”, but Kelly disagreed. Earlier this month another judge in the District of Columbia’s federal court upheld prosecutors’ use of the same obstruction charge in a separate case against to riot defenders. To date more than 700 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the Capitol riot and at least 165 of them have pleaded guilty.",News/US news,Indictment of Proud Boys leaders charged over US Capitol attack upheld,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/29/indictment-of-proud-boys-leaders-charged-over-us-capitol-attack-upheld
12/30/2021,"An alleged police culture of impunity helped an officer who took selfies while on duty at a murder scene commit a litany of disciplinary offences on an “industrial scale” for six years, it has been claimed. PC Ryan Connolly, from the Merseyside force, resigned after his taking and sharing of photos of the vulnerable came to light, as well as his sharing of racist and offensive images.  The Guardian revealed that between 2014 and 2020 Connolly took photos on his mobile phone of people in mental health crises, in hospitals, and had photos and graphics on his mobile phone that were grossly racist, including an image of a Ku Klux Klan member. Merseyside police and court officials confirmed that Connolly was also convicted in November of three counts of possessing extreme pornography. He will be sentenced next month at Manchester crown court. Connolly faced a discipline tribunal last month, and Vinny Tomlinson, former chair of Merseyside’s Black Police Association, attended. Tomlinson said: “In all of my time working at Merseyside police, Connolly’s conduct is the worst example of one person’s misconduct of this type I can recall. He transgressed on an almost industrial scale, over a number of years, most of which was carried out whilst he was on duty.” Connolly’s case was referred to prosecutors for the photos he took while on duty over the material found on his phone relating to vulnerable people; sometimes it related those who had gone to the police for help, and sometimes suspects. The case was investigated by police, who consulted lawyers from the Crown Prosecution Service, sources confirm. Connolly’s case echoes that of the two Metropolitan police officers who used their mobile phones to take pictures at the scene where two sisters lay murdered. The pair were convicted in court after admitting misconduct in public office. Tomlinson said more answers were needed about the case: “Why has Connolly not faced criminal charges for misconduct in a public office and data protection breaches? Have all of the individuals abused by Connolly been contacted by Merseyside police and aware? Have the family of the murder victim been informed of Connolly’s behaviour at the scene of their son’s murder? “Why has Merseyside police still not published the outcome of Connolly’s hearing within 28 days as it is required to do?” Merseyside police said: “The allegations constituted breaches of force policy, and a gross misconduct hearing was deemed the most suitable means of dealing with the matters.” Details about Connolly come after a horrendous year for policing. In addition to the two Met officers were jailed for their taking of photos of a murder scene, one officer was jailed for a whole-life term after using police equipment to kidnap and murder Sarah Everard after plucking her off a London street in March 2021. In the West Mercia force an officer became the first in over 30 years to be convicted of manslaughter for using violence during the course of his duties. Former PC Benjamin Monk fired an electric stun gun for over 30 seconds at former premiership footballer Dalian Atkinson, and kicked him twice in the head, which contributed to his death in August 2016. Liz Fekete, of the Institute for Race Relations, said: “The increasing number of police officers found to have shared racist, sexist, homophobic and frankly depraved content via private WhatsApp groups suggests police leadership has lost control of the rank and file. “No doubt they will spin these cases as examples of effective internal mechanisms to rid the force of rogue elements or rotten apples, but cases such as these, often undetected for years, are proliferating because these officers believe they are above scrutiny due to a culture of denying racism and silencing whistleblowers within the force.” Andy George, president of the National Black Police Association, said: “Racism and the canteen culture of the past appears to have moved to online platforms where people feel comfortable to speak openly about things they know are wrong in today’s modern police service. WhatsApp groups have been a particular area of concern … “Senior leaders need to admit the systemic issues which allow individuals to thrive and racism to continue which erodes trust and confidence in our diverse communities.” The discipline tribunal found Connolly guilty of gross misconduct. He had resigned before the November hearing, and after the tribunal he was formally sacked by Merseyside police. Connolly had also had an association with a known criminal without informing his bosses. He took photos in 2018 of himself at a murder scene where he had been assigned to guard the cordon after a teenager had been stabbed to death. Merseyside police’s deputy chief constable, Ian Critchley, said: “The behaviour of this officer is deplorable and serves to undermine the public’s confidence and trust in the police. “His actions are an insult to the uniform and the police service, which consistently strives to protect our communities and provide a professional and inclusive service to the people of Merseyside.”",News/UK news,Rogue police officer: Merseyside force under fire over Ryan Connolly,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/29/rogue-police-officer-merseyside-force-under-fire-over-ryan-connolly
12/30/2021,"A Russian court has ordered the closure of the Memorial Human Rights Centre (MHRC), a day after the supreme court revoked the legal status of its sister organisation, Memorial International. Moscow city court authorised the dissolution of the group – one of Russia’s most venerated human rights institutions – for the “justification of extremism and terrorism” by religious groups including Jehovah’s Witnesses officially considered “extremist” in Russia.  MHRC has said it plans to appeal against the decision in the European court of human rights. On Wednesday evening, Memorial International published a letter from the European court ordering Russia to suspend its decision to dissolve MHRC and Memorial International, pending a legal review of Russia’s “foreign agent” legislation. Russia’s response to the decision, which it is treaty-bound to enforce, is not yet clear. The head of MHRC, Alexander Cherkasov, said he believed the decision to liquidate it was politically motivated and that the Russian government was acting to suppress civil rights. The group had also named Alexei Navalny, an opposition leader, as a political prisoner. His nationwide organisation was declared extremist earlier this year. On Tuesday, Russia’s supreme court dissolved Memorial International, founded by dissidents in the 1980s to research the Stalin-era repressions of millions of Soviet citizens. The court orders conclude a year in which there has been an unprecedented assault on civil liberties in Russia, as opposition activists have been jailed or driven into exile, while dozens of media outlets and NGOs have been declared foreign agents or liquidated outright. Memorial International said in a statement it would “find legal ways to continue our work”, which include researching and popularising information about Soviet atrocities. “Memorial is not just an organisation, nor just a social movement,” the statement said. “Memorial is the demand of Russian citizens for the truth of its tragic past, about the fates of many millions of people. And this demand cannot be ‘liquidated’ by anyone.” The Council of Europe commissioner for human rights, Dunja Mijatović, called the ruling a “deplorable move that will have significant negative consequences for human rights protection in Russia”. She also criticised Russia’s “foreign agents” law for having a “repressive character”. European governments have also criticised Russia’s attempt to close down its oldest human rights organisations. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said Memorial’s closure was “another chilling blow to freedom of expression in Russia” and that she was “deeply concerned”. A spokesperson for the UN human rights office told AFP that Memorial’s forced closure and the actions of the court “further weaken the country’s dwindling human rights community”.",News/World news,Russian court orders closure of another human rights group ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/29/russian-court-orders-closure-of-another-human-rights-group
12/30/2021,"A “charismatic little fish” declared extinct in the wild has been reintroduced to its native Mexico after being bred in an aquarium at Chester zoo. The tequila fish (Zoogoneticus tequila), which grows to no bigger than 70mm long, disappeared from the wild in 2003 owing to the introduction of invasive, exotic fish species and water pollution.  Named after the Tequila volcano, which looms north of its native habitat, the species was discovered in 1990 in the Teuchitlán River in Jalisco, south-west Mexico. Now conservationists at Chester zoo and the Michoacana University of Mexico have teamed up to return more than 1,500 fish to the river in a project cited as an International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) case study for successful reintroductions. Recent studies have confirmed that the fish are thriving and already breeding in the Teuchitlán. Experts say it has created a blueprint for future reintroductions of other highly endangered fish species, with a rescue mission for another, the golden skiffia (Skiffia francesae), now under way. Prof Omar Dominguez, of the Michoacana University of Mexico, said: “This is the first time an extinct species of fish has ever been successfully reintroduced in Mexico and so it’s a real landmark for conservation. It’s a project which has now set an important precedent for the future conservation of the many fish species in the country that are threatened or even extinct in the wild but which rarely take our attention.” In 1998, at the outset of the project, the university’s aquatic biology unit received five pairs of fish from Chester zoo. These 10 fish founded a new colony in the university’s laboratory, which experts maintained and expanded over the next 15 years. In preparation for the reintroduction, 40 males and 40 females from the colony were released into large, artificial ponds at the university. This exposed them to a semi-natural environment where they would encounter fluctuating resources, potential competitors, parasites, and predators such as birds, turtles and snakes. After four years, this population was estimated to have increased to 10,000 individuals and became the source for the reintroduction to the wild. A long-term monitoring programme was established involving local people trained to assess water and habitat quality. Dr Gerardo Garcia, Chester zoo’s curator of lower vertebrates and invertebrates, said the successful reintroduction was an important moment in the battle for species conservation. “It is a real privilege to have helped save this charismatic little fish and it just goes to show that with the skill and expertise of conservationists, and with local communities fully invested in a reintroduction project, species can make a comeback from environments where they were once lost,” he said. “With nature declining globally at rates unprecedented in human history – and the rate of extinction accelerating – this is a rare success story. We now have a blueprint for what works in terms of recovering these delicate fish species in Mexico and already we’re on to the next one – a new rescue mission for the golden skiffia is already well under way.”",News/Environment,UK zoo helps lost Mexican fish live to see another Tequila sunrise,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/29/uk-zoo-helps-lost-mexican-fish-live-to-see-another-tequila-sunrise
12/30/2021,"If a guest edit by the England and Manchester City footballer Raheem Sterling was intended to cut through the surfeit of Covid-flavoured items that make up the Today programme in 2021, then the news agenda had other ideas. With panicked updates on PCR test shortages and reduced isolation times dominating, it was 40 minutes into Sterling’s special episode before we encountered any of his contributions. Once they had begun, however, it was clear what Sterling’s key themes would be: social mobility, his efforts to inspire the next generation with his charitable foundation, and the impressive feats of the England Euro 2020 squad in the face of appalling racism. From Jamaica – where the 27-year-old was born – we heard about his efforts to help young people out of deprivation. The report was light on detail, but demonstrated Sterling’s importance in the world beyond the UK. Presenter Amol Rajan then spoke to football coach Clive Ellington, an early mentor to Sterling, who highlighted the need to consider the mental health and wellbeing of children who are being primed for sporting success. During the first two hours of the programme, there was much talk of overcoming barriers in society, especially educational ones, but no deeper discussion about why these barriers exist.  The story of Sterling’s mother, Nadine, who was forced to take her children to work with her as a hotel cleaner once they had moved to the UK, and bought them breakfast from a vending machine with coins they found in the course of her work, was framed by the programme as something of a tough motivational tale rather than the stark indictment of British society that it is. Chair of the education select committee and Conservative MP Robert Halfon appeared briefly to talk about injustice, speaking too about white working-class children, but it would be good to have heard some more radical brainstorming about what it might take to bridge the entrenched divides in our society, which affect the working classes en masse.It was in the third hour, however, that Sterling’s takeover began to feel like just that, not least when he and England manager Gareth Southgate discussed building a relationship with the fans, and the importance of incorporating the diverse backgrounds of the players into the team itself. Sterling spoke confidently on subjects that felt relevant both to high-end athletes and ordinary folk: building mental resilience; not wishing your life away on social media; avoiding overthinking or becoming mired in negative comments. Southgate, meanwhile, described how he revisited his painful penalty miss at Euro 96 to create a supportive environment for the team he manages. A discussion about their love of football eased into a conversation about society at large, and the value of footballers having their own projects and interests off the pitch. Next, Nick Robinson’s interview with Usain Bolt was occasionally fawning, but once again underscored the links between Sterling and Jamaica, and the importance of sportspeople being allowed to engage with the world at large: “We are humans … why can’t we have an opinion?” asked the sprinter. “It’s unfair to know that somebody would look at sportspeople who work hard and are trying to give back and make the world a better place, and just put us in a box.”We returned to Sterling for the last word, and he spoke impressively about trying meditation; his changing relationship with the media, which vilified him early in his career by focusing on his spending and partying (he felt, he said, as though he was “being targeted”); and how football had been “a lifesaver” for him. It would have been great to have heard more on this, crammed as it was into the final part of the programme. Indeed, it was only here that we learned that Sterling did not attend a mainstream school until the end of his primary education in year six – a detail that felt important considering the discussion of education that had run throughout the previous three hours. Sterling managed to overcome the challenges in his life, he said, by staying mentally and physically fit, but clearly there is much more to the story. We can only hope that Radio 4 will let him come back and tell the rest of it – hopefully before next Christmas.

12/30/2021,"In Britain, food writing by “minority groups” – and here I’m talking about Indians, because that’s my own background – almost always gives a central role to those “heirloom family recipes” handed down the generations from mother or grandmother. When I started writing about food 20 years ago, an editor even joked that I would have to “invent a grandmother”. It was already a cliche a generation ago, but now this problematic pursuit of “authenticity” through appeals to a mythic matriarch is simply done to death. I’m not the only one fed up with the trope. I recently tweeted about my wish to see an Indian cookbook that actually reflected the growing reality of how so many people in India and across the diaspora learn to cook: not through a storied encounter between grandmother and child, but online. It struck a chord, with Indians commenting in droves. “I feel so seen,” wrote one, while random strangers wondered if I was referring to them.  This is not, of course, to say we shouldn’t write about our mothers’ and grandmothers’ recipes. There’s a great deal of value to be gleaned and deeply moving personal accounts to be enjoyed from the best of this type of writing. The restaurateur and chef Asma Khan, of London’s Darjeeling Express, has written wonderfully about her unique heritage, which combines the Mughlai cuisine of Hyderabad and Bengal with British- and Chinese-influenced street food and the cooking of Kolkata gentlemen’s clubs. She is one of many who shed light on regional or family dishes that we may otherwise not hear about. Which leads to my next point: I’m keen to read mothers’ and grandmothers’ recipes if what they cooked was unique – such as making a curry from orange peel, or pickling an unfamiliar berry from Rajasthan. But if these canonised figures are only telling me about bhindi masala or chapati that millions of Indians eat every day, and for which recipes are already abundant, they’re not saying anything new. Moreover, if you’ve been cooking your mother’s or grandmother’s recipe long enough to write about it, surely it’s now part of your own repertoire, and therefore your own recipe? But the crux is this: who are these mythical mothers and grandmothers anyway? They’re not all sari-clad women grinding masalas all day, magically producing aloo paratha and a steaming cup of masala chai out of thin air. The trope becomes a straitjacket, restricting our understanding of the rich and varied lives they have led. Mothers and grandmothers in India were sometimes adding rosemary and thyme to their curries in the 1920s due to the British influence; dancing in jazz clubs in the 1930s; graduating as lawyers and engineers or running bars in the 1940s; hosting supper clubs in their homes in the 1950s; whipping up cocktails and canapes in the 1960s; and may have offered you a slice of green-chilli-flecked pizza from their new electric oven in the 1970s. More recently, you may well catch them surreptitiously adding soy sauce to their dal to amp up the umami, or using sumac as a souring agent in chhole. If you visit a grandmother in India today, she may well prefer to order a milkshake and a curry puff from the local bakery on a delivery app than spend hours making samosas. India – and therefore its food culture – has changed significantly in the past 50 years as a result of globalisation and international influences. Indians have been tinkering with Maggi noodles in their kitchens and tucking into burgers in shopping malls for so long they’ve become part of the cuisine. A Goan Christmas cake is now likely to have been replaced by a Nigella Christmas cake. I’m not saying all traditional dishes have disappeared, just pointing to the vast gulf between the India as fantasised in diaspora cookbooks and the reality. While the disappearance of a historical cuisine makes me desperately sad, I also know that recipes are kept alive when a large number of people cook them, not when a few people record them. Young Indians – but also their mothers and grandmothers – are looking up new dishes on blogs, YouTube, TikTok and WhatsApp. They didn’t all learn to cook at a young age: they may not have been interested; or their mothers may have been terrible cooks; or perhaps they were actively discouraged from entering the kitchen and told to focus on getting good grades instead. They may have learned later in life thanks to a newfound culinary passion or for reasons of practicality, or perhaps as a way of reconnecting to a culture that they turned their back on in their youth. I know of men who attempt to recreate their late mothers’ dishes from memory; of single mothers juggling jobs and kids looking for budget-friendly ideas and short-cuts; of well-travelled young professionals concocting entirely new dishes by fusing the food of their heritage with British flavours and international ingredients and techniques. Cookery books should widen their lenses to capture the stories of all these people. So let’s liberate our mothers and grandmothers from the burden of “tradition”. Let’s change the narrative on Indian food. Sejal Sukhadwala is a London-based food writer.

12/30/2021,"The UK steel industry is braced for an immediate slump in trade from New Year’s Day when European Union rivals will gain a 25% price advantage selling to the giant US market. The EU and the US reached a Halloween agreement to remove tariffs on a quota of steel and aluminium imported from the bloc into the US from 1 January, but tariffs will remain on all UK steel and aluminium exports after government talks failed to secure a matching breakthrough.  The international trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, earlier this month invited the US commerce secretary for further discussions in London, which are understood to be scheduled for January. However, an industry source said they were not optimistic that a deal would be reached quickly. The tariffs were first introduced by former president Donald Trump in 2018 under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act on national security grounds. Imports supposedly undermined the US’s ability to produce its own steel. British exports to the EU could also be hit because of an unusually strict clause in the EU-US agreement that means steel originating in the UK will still attract the tariffs even if worked on and exported by EU companies. Gareth Stace, the director-general of UK Steel, said: “UK steel exports to the US have halved since President Trump introduced steel tariffs in 2018. There can be no doubt these measures have significantly harmed the UK’s interests in its second biggest steel export market. “Whilst we welcome the move by the US to start easing its tariffs, without a UK deal in very quick succession, our export position will only deteriorate further. It is essential that the government strains every sinew to secure a deal and ensure that UK steelmakers are able to sell their steel into the United States.” Harish Patel, the national officer for steel at Unite, a trade union representing many British steelworkers, said the government needed to explain why the EU had a deal but the UK did not, amid reports that the US was holding back over the UK’s threats to unilaterally change post-Brexit trading rules governing Northern Ireland. The UK negotiated the so-called Northern Ireland protocol barely a year ago as part of the Brexit trade deal with the EU, but it has repeatedly said it may unilaterally break it off. President Joe Biden has warned Boris Johnson against threatening peace on the island of Ireland. Junior international trade minister Penny Mordaunt this month denied that the failure to reach a steel deal was linked to Brexit. She told parliament: “That story might be true in terms of how some people in the United States feel, but it is a false narrative. These are two entirely separate issues.” Patel said: “It is alarming that British-produced steel is being effectively locked out of the critical steel market, as the continuing tariffs make EU steel considerably cheaper. “The government has to sort this matter out quickly. Unless the tariffs are speedily lifted, hundreds of jobs in the steel and associated industries, most of them in so-called red wall seats, are at risk.” A government spokesperson said: “We recognise the vital role the steel sector plays in our economy and our priority is to resolve this dispute to the benefit of workers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic, removing the need for the UK to levy retaliatory tariffs on US goods. “Until that resolution is agreed, the UK will continue to apply its rebalancing measures to defend our economic interests and the rules-based international trading system.”",News/Business,UK steel industry braces for slump in trade as US reduces tariffs on EU,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/29/uk-steel-industry-braces-for-slump-in-trade-as-us-eu-tariffs-abolished
12/30/2021,"Scotland has detected a record number of 15,900 new Covid cases, with about 80% of those believed to be the highly infectious Omicron variant, Nicola Sturgeon has told MSPs. In an emergency update to the Scottish parliament, the first minister said positive cases comprised 29% of all tests carried out on Tuesday. The previous Scottish record was reached on Sunday, when 11,030 new cases were reported.  Sturgeon said the Omicron variant was so infectious it was reasonable to assume there would be further “steep increases in cases in the days and possibly weeks ahead”. She urged eligible adults to book booster vaccinations after disclosing that so far only 75% had received their booster or third doses. She hinted that the Scottish government may miss its target of getting 80% of adults boosted by Friday 31 December, a target date coinciding with Hogmanay. “Please don’t delay,” she said. “Every booster jab administered now is a step on the road back to normality.” Sturgeon indicated the slowing pace of booster vaccinations had influenced the Scottish government’s decision not to cut the self-isolation period for close contacts from 10 to seven days – a measure introduced by the UK government in England. Facing intense pressure from the Conservatives and Labour to reduce the self-isolation time to ease staffing pressures on businesses and public services, Sturgeon said a careful balance needed to be struck between helping businesses and suppressing the virus. Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative leader, said businesses across Scotland were struggling with high levels of staff absence and unable to plan ahead because of Sturgeon’s “dithering”. Some firms were shutting. Big Hogmanay events, including Edinburgh’s street party and fireworks, and the Loony Dook swim at Queensferry, have been cancelled, with ministers urging revellers to remain at home or attend small parties. Sturgeon said neither the Welsh nor Northern Irish governments had cut the self-isolation period, which showed there were doubts it was the best course of action. Her government was offering £375m in emergency support to businesses, including £16m for bus companies, £27m to the cultural sector and £17m to the events sector, she said. “If Covid continues to spread rapidly, the economic impact in the form of staff absences and diminished consumer confidence will be severe. We’re already seeing those impacts. So doing nothing won’t help business,” she said. “We must protect public health and the economy together – by slowing the speed at which Covid is spreading, while we complete the booster programme.” She said 679 people were in hospital, an increase of 80 on Tuesday’s total, with three deaths reported of people confirmed to have had Covid. Over the past week, the number of cases had risen by 47%.",News/UK news,Scotland reports record number of cases as Omicron takes hold,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/29/scotland-reports-record-number-of-cases-as-omicron-takes-hold
