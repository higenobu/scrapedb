3/19/2022,"The Georgia gubernatorial candidate and voting rights campaigner Stacey Abrams has been made president – of United Earth. The honour was bestowed by the Paramount+ TV series Star Trek: Discovery, in its season four finale. Abrams is a self-confessed Star Trek superfan. In 2019, she told the New York Times she binged on episodes during her last run for governor. “I love Voyager and I love Discovery and of course I respect the original,” she said, “but I revere The Next Generation.” Michelle Paradise, executive producer of Star Trek: Discovery, told Variety the show decided it needed a figure of suitable gravitas. “When the time came to start talking about the president of Earth,” she said, “it seemed like, ‘Well, who better to represent that than her?” Abrams is a former Democratic member of the Georgia state house as well as a prolific romance novelist. She has said she will be US president by 2040. In 2018, she ran the Republican Brian Kemp close for governor of Georgia. She is seeking a rematch this year and in part thanks to her work on voting rights has risen to prominence in the national party, having been considered for vice-president to Joe Biden. Abrams’s work helped secure Biden’s win in Georgia in 2020 and indeed Democratic control of the US Senate, via two Georgia run-offs. Such work has made her a target of the right. On Friday, the National Review, a conservative site, published a column about her Star Trek cameo: Stacey Abrams Does Not Deserve to Be President of Earth. Abrams, the Review said, “is, at this time, most famous for losing the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election and then proceeding to deny she had lost it”. Abrams refused to concede to Kemp, who as Georgia secretary of state oversaw the purging of voter rolls before the election he contested. Brad Raffensperger, the current Georgia secretary of state, has argued that Abrams’ refusal to concede was “morally indistinguishable from – and helped set the stage for – former president Donald Trump’s behavior after the 2020 presidential election”. Raffensperger famously stood up to Trump, whose request that he “find” sufficient votes to flip the state remains at the heart of a grand jury investigation. In 2019, Abrams told the New York Times that while she “legally acknowledge[d] that Brian Kemp secured a sufficient number of votes under our existing system to become the governor of Georgia. I do not concede that the process was proper, nor do I condone that process.” She also said: “I have no empirical evidence that I would have achieved a higher number of votes. However, I have sufficient and I think legally sufficient doubt about the process to say that it was not a fair election.” The Review complained that Star Trek would never make Trump president of Earth, not even “in the way that the evil genetic superman Khan Noonien Singh once despotically ruled one-quarter of earth’s population”. It added: “In classic Trek fashion, Abrams [was] shown as the logical and inevitable result of the kind of technocratic progressivism that the show has long advanced, a fruition of our highest ideals. Her behavior in the political sphere does not seem to bear this out.” Elie Mystal, a writer for the Nation, responded: “Look at how conservative white people react to a FICTIONAL black woman president.” Mystal also tied the Review’s criticism to events in Washington, where Ketanji Brown Jackson will next week begin confirmation hearings to be the first Black woman on the supreme court. “Next week,” Mystal wrote, “this same publication that can’t handle a black women president ON A TELEVISION SHOW is going to claim to have reasonable and *totally not racist* thoughts about a real life black woman on the supreme court.” The makers of Star Trek: Discovery seemed happy just to have had Abrams on set. They also explained how they fulfilled her request not to be told of the plot of her episode, so she could enjoy it later. As the Washington Post reported, the episode, which was filmed in Toronto last August, ended with Abrams “telling the show’s protagonist … ‘There’s a lot of work to do. Are you ready for that?’ “‘I am,’ [Captain Michael Burnham] responds. ‘Let’s get to it.’” Sonequa Martin-Green, who plays Burnham, told Variety she was “taken aback … and really moved” by Abrams’ performance. “It really signaled the culmination of the season having her there,” she said, “because she’s such this symbol of hope and strength and connection and sacrifice and building something bigger than yourself that will last generations, and that’s exactly what we’re talking about doing in the story.” In a “cherished moment”, Martin-Green said, Abrams was presented with a trophy, a captain’s badge and a poem.",News/US news,Stacey Abrams made president of Earth in Star Trek cameo ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/19/stacey-abrams-president-earth-star-trek-georgia-governor
3/19/2022,"West Indies v England at Kensington Oval is a special occasion that takes place on sacred ground; a country so lush by way of cricketing talent per head over the years, Barbados stands out as one of world sport’s most remarkable hotspots. Before the roll call of great Barbadian cricketers spools down the page, first consider the numbers: with a population of 287,000, the new republic would sit fourth bottom were it ranked alongside England’s 48 counties, tucked between Herefordshire and Northumberland (with more palm trees than either). And yet this 21-miles-by-14-miles island, the most easterly in the Lesser Antilles, is the first in the Caribbean to produce more than a century of international cricketers. Of the 385 men to play for West Indies since they first took the field at Lord’s in 1928, 98 (25.45%) hail from Barbados, with the far more populous Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago next on 83. There are 90 Barbadians who have played Test cricket on the list and eight more have won white-ball caps alone. Add the four players to cross the Atlantic and represent England – Roland Butcher, Gladstone Small, Chris Jordan and Jofra Archer – and its bat is already raised before getting to its 15 West Indies women and the 11 men to have played for associate nations. “Everything suggests that it is highly likely the most verdant place in the history of the sport,” says Andrew Samson, the leading cricket statistician, after he and the local journalist David Harris helped confirm the numbers. “If not in terms of square miles then at least per capita. And I would imagine it would be in the conversation for any international sport, not just cricket.” As England’s cricketers and their sun-seeking supporters have taken in their surroundings during the second Test they will have noted that this is not just quantity but quality, whether walking past the statue of Sir Garfield Sobers, reading the names of Wes Hall, Charlie Griffith, Everton Weekes, Frank Worrell, Clyde Walcott, Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes adorning the stands or spying the two ends, Malcolm Marshall and Joel Garner. This isn’t just a nostalgia trip either; when West Indies routed England here three years ago, six of the XI were Bajan. The numbers fluctuate and have dropped in the current side – four of the most recent XI – but they are still led by Kraigg Brathwaite, boast a world-class all-rounder in Jason Holder and have Kemar Roach, a fast bowler who went into the second Test 15 wickets away from becoming the sixth West Indian to reach the 250 mark. “It really just comes back to the love the people have for the game,” says Roland Butcher, who grew up in St Phillip on the eastern side of the island. He went on to become the first black cricketer to represent England when he made his Test debut at this storied ground in 1981 and the local headline read “Our boy, their bat”. “Cricket is in the blood of Barbadians, it just became a natural thing to us like football is in Brazil. In the past black people were limited in the sports they could do and for me, growing up in the country, all that was available was cricket and track and field. Most of the great players came out of informal cricket, kids playing among themselves. There wasn’t coaching, the game itself was the teacher.” Theories abound as to why this came to be. Certainly the island had a head start, with St Ann’s Garrison south of Bridgetown the first club formed in the Caribbean in 1806. Some have noted the influence of the military in integrating the sport into society or the club scene, others the island’s porous coral rock and abundant sunshine, which combine to make ideal surfaces for fast bowling and stroke play. For Butcher it also comes down to early heroes and the sharpening of skills in those more rustic settings. “I think the rest of the region recognises the role Barbados has played in West Indies cricket,” he says. “I’m not sure I agree with the saying that when Barbados is strong, West Indies is strong, but we’ve had such a rich history and legacy of great players here, we’ve always had people to look up to here. That breeds more. “I would only see the great players on film once a month when a van came to our school with a big screen and they showed maybe an old Test match along with films like Laurel and Hardy. But ultimately it was about playing the sport. “We played anywhere and everywhere. Playing on the beach, the edge of the surf, the ball skids on from the surface and your reactions have to be quicker. When we played on turf we prepared the pitches ourselves, picking out stones, wetting it and rolling it. But the ball still deviated and you needed sharp reflexes. These may seem like disadvantages but they became advantages to us.” Butcher has worked as a coach and an administrator in Barbados since his playing days, recently retiring from the island’s first-class selection panel but still a board director and on the Cricket West Indies cricket strategy committee. Contrary to the notion that the region was left behind when professionalism took hold elsewhere, he wonders whether modern coaching has in fact been too regimented and conformist for this part of the world, ironing out some of the instinct rather than enhancing it. “These days the players don’t find out so much for themselves,” says the 68-year-old. “Before, we were different from the rest of the world, playing free and spirited cricket. But we joined the bandwagon of restrictive coaching and it doesn’t always allow for players to play naturally, they get caught between two stalls.” It makes an interesting counterpoint as English cricket, blessed with enviable resources and numbers, launches its latest corporate response to defeat in Australia with a game-wide review into structures, elite pathways, competitions and the like. Sometimes it simply comes down to passion.",Sport/Sport,‘It’s in the blood’: how Barbados became cricket’s ultimate hotspot,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/19/its-in-the-blood-how-barbados-became-crickets-ultimate-hotspot
3/19/2022,"Born in Luton in 1984, Nadiya Hussain is one of the best-loved winners of The Great British Bake Off. Catapulted from obscurity to primetime favourite in 2015, she has since baked a three-tiered orange drizzle cake for the Queen’s 90th birthday, fronted cookery shows such as Nadiya’s British Food Adventure and the documentary Anxiety and Me, and published multiple books. She lives in Milton Keynes with her husband, two sons and her daughter, Maryam, 11. She releases Nadiya Loves, a range of cookware and bakeware products, available from John Lewis and Prestige, this month. This was a photo from an Italian restaurant – it was the first time we all went to dinner after I won Bake Off. There were a lot of firsts that night: it was where Maryam first had deep-fried whitebait, which she loved, and it was the first time she’d worn lipstick. She said: “Mummy, please could you wear the same colour as me?” I felt I should capture that memory. The pose here is very indicative of our relationship; Maryam is attached to me like you wouldn’t believe. Ever since she was little, she was very clingy. It irritated a lot of people because they never got their own opportunity to enjoy her. For a while she was happy to stay over at her cousins’ houses, especially when I was away a lot for work. But now it’s come full circle – partly to do with the pandemic, partly because she is full of hormones and something is changing in her dramatically. Motherhood is a bizarre thing. It gives a lot but it takes so much from you, too. It’s why my husband submitted my application to Bake Off without me knowing: I had become so reliant on the comfort of my family and stopped doing things for myself. I’ll never forget the moment when I left the house for the audition. It was the first time I’d been on a train, and the first time I’d been in a taxi on my own. I ended up getting lost and arrived five hours late – but I still got there. And I am so glad I did. When your life revolves around your children, you stop taking risks. I needed someone to say: “You have to take those risks to be able to have a bigger world, because your world is small. There is more out there.” Growing up in an Asian community around Bangladeshi folk, I was not raised with praise or to know my worth; it was survival for the most part. I suppose that’s what I want to do differently with Maryam. I want to raise my daughter to believe that she is much more than she thinks she is; she is not always going to be judged like her counterparts, and there will be prejudice. I am ready to hold her up and remind her she is wonderful and growing every day, and doesn’t have to put pressure on herself to be perfect. I didn’t have that encouragement, but she will. That said, she is a tween and is very much being told to wind her neck in. At the moment she wants to be a psychotherapist. We always have these deep and meaningful conversations about life, often when I’m about to go to bed. We talk very openly in our house about my mental health issues, my anxiety and PTSD, and she has said she wants to help people who are struggling. She also says she wants to make jewellery and dog biscuits, so who knows! One of her passions is musical theatre. When I saw her perform, she was the only person on stage who was not white, and for me that was a lovely moment. In my job I occupy a space that is often taken up by Caucasian middle-aged men. It’s quite daunting, as a 5ft 1in Muslim woman, to walk into an environment that wasn’t created for me – whether it’s a world of media or publishing – as there’s an element of having to prove myself all the time. The burden weighs heavily on my mind, but representing is something that needs doing. Especially as a role model for Maryam. I am scarily introverted and I need pushing out of the house sometimes. The longest I’ve been away from Maryam was three and a half weeks. By day 10, the crew and I were all flagging – missing our comforts. Then, on day 12, something happens and you just stop missing home. That’s the point at which you need to do your job, then go home. Otherwise you’ll never go back. You realise there is a life outside your own family and you think, I quite like this actually! It’s great getting back to my children after shooting for long periods. On a Sunday, Maryam and I like to have pamper days. I call it a maintenance bath – we do our nails and we put oil in our hair. She loves to bake cookies at the weekend, but she rarely cooks with me. She’ll have a stir but she likes to do her own thing – she is independent and stubborn like her mother. The kitchen is the one space where we don’t do much together. But we are very much side by side. My earliest memories of Mum are when she used to drive me to school. We had a long journey and she would play music in the car, like Backstreet Boys and Mario, and she would sing along. It was a fun way to start the day. Mum says I am cheeky, and I agree. I’d describe her as decently strict, but we always get on well, and she has given me loads of confidence. I love being with Mum, and I don’t mind what we are doing as long as it’s just me and her. Especially when we are shopping. People will come up to us and say hello – sometimes I don’t like it because I’m trying to spend time with her, but most people are really kind, so it’s nice to see that. It is strange having a famous mum, but none of my friends have asked for her autograph. One of my favourite memories of Mum is going to the final of the Bake Off. All I remember from the day was that the tent was really big, and I felt so happy when she won. Mum didn’t have much hope, but I did, so I wasn’t surprised when they said her name. It was weird seeing her face on TV for the first time. I was nervous for her but part of me wanted her to be kicked out, so I could see her again.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Nadiya Hussain looks back: ‘I wasn’t raised to know my worth, but she will be’",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/19/nadiya-hussain-maryam-happy-mum-won-bake-off
3/19/2022,"With 1.5m refugee children having fled Ukraine, we think about the urgent need for humanitarian relief: food, water, shelter and clothing. But we must ensure children’s education is central to the immediate response to their suffering, because war doesn’t just wreck lives, it wrecks education too. Pick a humanitarian crisis: Syria, Greece, Afghanistan, Uganda. In every instance, education is the first service children lose. The sad truth is that children who are displaced by conflict remain in that situation for years. In a time of such suffering and need, why worry about education? Because it provides a sense of normality during upheaval and chaos. It provides a daily routine and some sense of hope for the future, while at the same time providing the opportunity for counselling and other essential mental health services. It also is a distribution point for health services, food and other necessities for children and their families. These services and supports are essential for all children. The provision of education in emergencies is always hugely appreciated by the families concerned. From my conversations with refugee parents, most recently in the Greek islands and Lebanon, their first priority after settling somewhere with some sense of stability is for their children to return to a meaningful level of schooling. But the international humanitarian community has its work cut out. More than half a million children have already crossed borders as refugees into neighbouring countries, chiefly Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania. None of them will have been in school for weeks, and they were already rebounding from the disruption due to Covid-19. An order to close all schools for two weeks when the invasion started – affecting all 5.7 million school-age children – was declared. Ukraine’s ministry of education has reported that 160 schools and education facilities were damaged or destroyed in the first week of Russia’s invasion. And bear in mind that what we are seeing now is in fact a rapid escalation of a crisis that has been affecting children in eastern Ukraine since 2014. More than 750 schools have been destroyed, damaged or forced to close, according to Save the Children, in the conflict with Russian-backed separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. We do at least know how to set about the challenge of educating Ukraine’s displaced children. At the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016, Education Cannot Wait, a global fund for education in emergencies and protracted crises, was launched and it has so far distributed $1bn in assistance. At the time, it was accepted that a minimum of 4% to 6% of emergency and humanitarian funding should be directed to education, though the European Union set benchmarks ranging from 10% to 15%, depending on the situation. However, the current humanitarian appeal for Ukraine asks that only 2.2% be devoted to education – about $11.40 for every child in need. We know this will not get us very far in providing the support children require. We are calling for educational provision to begin for Ukrainian refugee children within 30 days of them fleeing their homes. How education is best delivered for refugees will vary depending on location. The gold standard has been to integrate refugees into schools in the host community. If space is tight, double-shifting schools – using schools for two shifts a day – has been an effective approach. My organisation, Theirworld, was involved in setting up a successful double-shift system in Lebanon with the country’s ministry of education and UN partners, which has educated more than 350,000 Syrian refugee children in the past five years. In other instances, using the Ukrainian curriculum taught by refugee teachers may be appropriate. Additional non-formal education, such as play, sports, drama or simple reading groups, can be provided by UN agencies and non-governmental organisations. Schools in western Ukraine, if it remains a relatively safe zone, may be overrun with internally displaced children, and international assistance may well be required there. What’s certain is that this crisis will have dire impacts that last many, many months, and probably years, and so we must prioritise the educational wellbeing of Ukrainian children right away and help them cope with the trauma that has been inflicted on them. In Ukraine, as in any conflict, children lose the most – their childhoods and their innocence. We have been too slow to respond in the past. Let’s not make the same mistake.

3/19/2022,"The government is reviewing all its contracts with P&O Ferries, as Labour called for the halting of its sailings on Saturday after the company sacked 800 staff and brought in replacement agency workers. The Conservative party co-chair Oliver Dowden said P&O Ferries and its owner, DP World, “should be in no doubt the government is considering very closely its relationship with them”. “All of us feel, frankly, a revulsion at the kind of sharp practices from P&O. There has been a complete lack of engagement, a lack of prior notice or indeed any empathy whatsoever for the workers,” he told Times Radio. After reports the firm intended to resume the Liverpool-Dublin route with its Norbank ship on Saturday, the shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, said: “P&O must not be allowed to sail today with replacement agency labour for loyal workers unjustly sacked this week. Strong words from the government are meaningless – they must step in and act.” Union calls for a boycott of P&O were also backed by the Labour MP for East Hull, Karl Turner, who said he had for years been raising concerns about legal loopholes that meant the national minimum wage did not apply on international ferry routes, and called on the government to do more to punish the company for its actions. “The government should be telling every single person to boycott P&O Ferries. That should be the message because we should not be allowing a pariah business to take advantage of British workers,” he said on the BBC’s Today programme, adding they should demand back the £10m furlough money provided to the company during the pandemic. Labour has also urged the government to publish the legal advice it received on whether P&O broke the law by making so many roles redundant without consultation, and asked if ministers were able to reverse the decision. “We are demanding the prime minister grants access to the legal advice the Department for Transport received on whether P&O Ferry’s actions constitute a breach of the law, and whether there are legal levers to get the decision reversed,” said Keir Starmer. “Full transparency is vital to prevent anyone else from being subjected to this appalling behaviour.” Labour party analysis showed P&O Ferries had received £38.3m in government contracts since December 2018. In a new statement on Friday, P&O Ferries said its decision was a “last resort” after concluding “the business wouldn’t survive without fundamentally changed crewing arrangements”. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said he had instructed the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) to carry out inspections of all P&O vessels before they returned to sea to check the new crews the company had “rushed through” were safe. Protesters are expected to march on the Tory party conference on Saturday for another day of demonstrations against the move, after protests at ports in London, Liverpool, Larne, Hull and Dover on Friday. The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “If the company has breached the law it must face severe consequences – not just a slap on the wrist. What happened at P&O can never, ever be allowed to happen again. Ministers must urgently bring forward an employment bill to stop workers from being treated like disposable labour. The time for excuses is over.”",News/Business,UK government reviewing its P&O Ferries contracts after staff sackings,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/19/uk-government-reviewing-its-po-ferries-contracts-after-staff-sackings
3/19/2022,"Protests by local residents have forced the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to cancel a trip to a Belize village that was scheduled to kick off their Caribbean toursidents. Opposition to the royal excursion had arisen from a dispute between residents of Toledo district and Flora and Fauna International, a conservation charity Prince William is a patron of. He and Kate were expected to visit the Akte‘il Ha cacao farm in Indian Creek on the first full day of their charm offensive in the region, but their office cancelled the engagement on Friday. It comes as they undertake a tour of Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas which is seen as an attempt to drum up support for the monarchy and persuade other nations not to follow Barbados by choosing to become a republic. The Belize landing site of William and Kate’s helicopter – a local football pitch – caused further issues with residents, who claim they had not been consulted about it. The local broadcaster Channel 7 described the tensions between the citizens and the state as about the “meaning of consent in the context of communal land rights, rights to lands that were expunged in the colonial period by the British”. The chair of Indian Creek village, Sebastian Shol, told the Daily Mail: “We don’t want them to land on our land, that’s the message that we want to send. “They could land anywhere, but not on our land.” A Kensington Palace spokesperson said: “We can confirm that due to sensitive issues involving the community in Indian Creek, the visit has been moved to a different location. Further details will be provided in due course.” The Belize government said in a statement: “Indian Creek was one of several sites being considered. Due to issues in the village, the government of Belize activated its contingency planning and another venue has been selected to showcase Maya family entrepreneurship in the cacao industry.” The couple are scheduled to land in Belize on Saturday afternoon in Voyager, the ministerial jet. The country’s governor general, Froyla Tzalam, will welcome them couple – along with their entourage of 15, including a hairdresser, private secretaries and press team, before they head to Belize City to meet the prime minister, Johnny Briceño. Windrush campaigners and Caribbean experts have criticised the tour, saying the UK should be actively helping nations to cut ties with the monarchy rather than convincing them to stay. “Britain still has key legal and economic ties, which makes it difficult for a country like Jamaica to be truly independent,” the author and Windrush campaigner Patrick Vernon said. “This year is an opportunity for people to reflect: do we want to be a republic, and what does that mean? If Jamaica decided it did, there would be a domino effect on the rest of the English-speaking Caribbean.”",News/UK news,William and Kate cancel Belize village trip due to protests,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/19/william-and-kate-cancel-belize-village-trip-due-to-protests
