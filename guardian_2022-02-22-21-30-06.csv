2/22/2022,"Sixteen-year-old Izzy (Zelda Adams) lives in a house in the woods with her mother (Toby Poser) where she is being home-schooled because she has an auto-immune disease that makes her vulnerable to infections from other people. That and the fact that both mother and child are witch-like creatures called hellbenders who live for many decades, feed off mostly moss and seed cones, and reproduce asexually like ferns. But they’re happy together, mostly: they have a mini punk band, in which Izzy plays the drums (she’s pretty good), mum plays a mean bass, and they sing songs about the apocalypse and murdering while wearing face paint. It’s not exactly clear how they afford petrol or pay for new picks and drum sticks when needed, but maybe the cash is harvested from the hikers who wander accidentally on to their land and get vaporised by the mother’s supernatural powers, as does one hapless stranger played by John Adams. The power dynamics shift in this Rapunzel-like set-up when Izzy meets another teenage girl, a regular sort named Amber (Lulu Adams) who just happens to be the niece of a hiker mum recently dusted. Through Amber she meets some other teens, and starts to wonder if the isolation she’s been kept in all this time was strictly necessary. Eating a worm on a dare leads Izzy to realise she has supernatural powers that get stronger if she consumes another creature’s life force. Soon, she’s wanting to go into town by herself, giving up their vegetarian diet, and building a meaty tunnel in the basement, sort of like a huge vagina or a gullet, in which to eat her prey. Kids, they grow up so fast!  Although made on a tiny budget, this highly original exercise in folk horror punches well above its weight with snappy dialogue, trippy visual effects and impressive camerawork. But the most adorable thing about it is that it’s a family affair: John Adams and Toby Poser are married; Zelda and Lula Adams are their children. All of them took turns working on the crew when they weren’t in a scene, a working method the clan developed in their earlier features, Halfway to Zen and Rumblestrips. The Adams family shot this in lockdown; it’s a pretty impressive family venture given most of us barely managed to get our own kids interested in board games.

2/22/2022,"A retired military working dog named Hertz has been awarded a medal known as the animals’ Victoria Cross for his service in Afghanistan. The German shorthaired pointer is the first dog in British military history to detect electronic communications equipment such as mobile phones, voice recorders, sim cards and GPS devices.  Hertz, who serviced with the Royal Air Force police, has been awarded the PDSA Dickin medal, the 74th recipient of the honour since it was first awarded in 1943. Throughout his time in Afghanistan, Hertz was responsible for finding more than 100 items of contraband, including drugs and personal electronic devices (PEDs), described as a significant threat to the lives of service personnel and civilians. Born in Croatia, Hertz joined the RAF as a one-year-old after showing skills in drug detection. He was then selected as the first-ever military working dog to be trained to detect the presence of electronic devices (PEDs). After weeks of intense specialist training, assisted by the Prison Service, which uses sniffer dogs to detect electronics contraband, Hertz and his handler, WO Jonathan Tanner, were deployed to Afghanistan. Tanner and Hertz worked together daily in military and civilian compounds in the then British military base Camp Bastion. On his first search, Hertz discovered drugs and electronic devices, with the latter successful in supporting intelligence purposes. Hertz was deployed throughout Helmand province and to the Afghan capital of Kabul. During the 13 months of his tour, there was not a single rocket attack on Camp Bastion. The PDSA said: “His work was vital to ensure the safety of all the personnel working there, both locals and military. It is difficult to truly estimate how many lives he saved through his actions.” The first recipient of the Dickin medal was a pigeon, White Vision. She delivered a message that led to the rescue of a ditched aircrew in October 1943, flying nine hours in bad visibility and heavy weather with strong headwinds. Other recipients include Simon the cat in 1949 for “gallantry under fire” and for the disposal of many rats on board HMS Amethyst, and Olga the horse, who received the medal in 1947 for controlling traffic and assisting rescue operations after a flying bomb explosion in Tooting, south London.",News/UK news,Dog awarded animals’ Victoria Cross for RAF service in Afghanistan,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/22/dog-awarded-animals-victoria-cross-for-raf-service-in-afghanistan

2/22/2022,"The west has struggled to maintain unity in response to the presence of Russian troops in Ukraine as the UK and the EU prepared to unveil the scale and scope of the sanctions to be imposed on the Kremlin. A proposal to target a wide range of people and companies, including 351 members of the Russian Duma, over the decision to recognise the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk is being resisted by Hungary, whose right wing leader Viktor Orbán has a warm relationship to Vladimir Putin.  Meanwhile, despite the decision in Berlin to suspend certification of Nord Stream 2, Germany, France and Italy have been accused by more hawkish EU member states of “fetishising incremental” moves when it comes to a broader economic sanctions package. Comments by political leaders from London and Brussels were also markedly different on Tuesday morning despite attempts over the previous months to coordinate an approach in the face of Russian aggression. Josep Borrell, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, claimed that the movement of Russian military force into separatist territories in southeast Ukraine did not yet count as a “fully-fledged invasion”, while UK cabinet minister Sajid Javid was more hawkish. “We have seen that Putin has recognised breakaway eastern regions in Ukraine and from the reports we can already tell that he has sent in tanks and troops. From that you can conclude that the invasion of Ukraine has begun,” Javid said. The health secretary’s comments were later moderated by Boris Johnson who said he would announce sanctions at lunchtime on Tuesday but that “there is a lot more that we are going to do in the event of an invasion”. The problem facing the west in the of Russian aggressions is that Putin’s forces have long thought to be present in Russian-controlled territory in Donetsk and Luhansk – collectively known as the Donbas. The US had briefed a week ago that, unlike during the 2014 invasion of Ukraine, sanctions this time would start at the top of the ladder and stay there, rather than be gradually escalated. Johnson has also said that sanctions would be implemented as soon as one Russian toe-cap crossed into Ukrainian-held territory. But at the point at which ”peace-keeping” forces were formally sent by Putin into Ukraine, the west has proven less surefooted. A debate continues within the EU over how far to go in relation to current move by Moscow, with Baltic member states pushing for the toughest possible response for fear that the Kremlin will only taunt the west with incremental incursions against Ukraine. During a meeting on Tuesday morning of ambassadors for the 27 EU member states, the EU’s foreign affairs wing, the European external action service (EEAS), proposed sanctioning 27 persons and entities involved in the Kremlin’s decision over Luhansk and Donetsk, the 351 members of the Duma that voted in favour of it and the 11 that proposed it along with the commanders of the Russian military ‘peacekeeping’ mission. But Orbán’s government in Hungary has refused to support the move at this stage, diplomatic sources said. “They stressed the importance of dialogue and wanted to reconvene with [Budapest]”, one diplomat said. “It was to be expected but Orbán has now really shown his true colours. Again, this begs the question where Orbán’s loyalty is: to Moscow or his European allies. And the question of how much more of this blocking behavior other leaders can swallow.” A wider sanctions package is also being worked upon by the European commission mirroring the sanctions imposed at the time of the annexation of Crimea by Russia. In a joint statement, Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, presidents of the European commission and council, said member states would be asked to agree to target those involved in the latest decision, the banks financing Russian military operations, the ability of Russia to access the EU’s capital and financial markets and services, and all trade from the two breakaway regions to and from the EU, “to ensure that those responsible clearly feel the economic consequences of their illegal and aggressive actions”. EU foreign ministers are meeting in Paris this afternoon to find a common position. Sources said there were, however, “some worrying signals regarding the broader sanctions package”. According to one diplomat, Austria, Germany and Italy stressed the importance of gradually escalating the sanctions imposed for fear of losing leverage. Any sanctions package requires unanimity. The source said: “This fetish for incremental steps really raises questions on these countries’ willingness to approve the ‘big bang’ sanctions package when we need it.” Arriving for a routine meeting of ministers in Brussels, Lithuania’s deputy Europe minister Arnoldas Pranckevičius, insisted the time was ripe now to hit Moscow with a serious punitive package. Pranckevičius said: “How we react as the EU will define our character and indeed the future of Europe.” He called on Europe to move ahead with economic sanctions, double support to Ukraine, including boosting physical presence of political and diplomatic leaders in Kyiv, as well as to rethink its defence posture in the Baltic region. He added: “[EU sanctions] have to be serious, they have to be real, they should not be symbolic. If we want to deter further actions of President Putin, if we indeed want to stop the war from happening, we need to move ahead with serious measures.”",News/World news,West struggles to maintain unity in face of Russia-Ukraine crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/west-struggles-to-maintain-unity-in-face-of-russia-ukraine-crisis-eu-debate
2/22/2022,"On Monday the government announced its “living with Covid” strategy, including a phasing-out of free access to rapid lateral flow tests, reduced access to the more accurate PCR tests for most of those with symptoms, an end to legal requirements to self-isolate and an end to financial support for those on low incomes needing to self-isolate. Announcing the changes, which will come into force on Thursday, Boris Johnson said the time to “compel” people was over. Now “people will be asked to exercise personal responsibility” to look after each other, he said.  Health and education leaders and scientists are concerned about the wisdom of phasing out both testing and self-isolation measures at this stage of the pandemic – but given that it is happening, what will the shift in policy will mean in practice? What will things look like in the UK over the next year, and how will it affect our ability to deal with Covid-19? Supporters of relaxing the measures have often appealed to individual responsibility – whether that’s to voluntarily self-isolate if positive, or to assess our own appetite for risk and behave accordingly. But this misses the point: there is a limit to what the individual can do with a highly infectious disease. Many might choose to isolate if positive, but that relies on knowing you are positive in the first place, on being able to resist pressure from employers to go in to work, and on being able to afford to stay home (both financially and practically). All three aspects will become much more difficult from now on, and will necessarily put others at risk. And measures individuals can take to protect themselves, such as reducing social contact or wearing high-quality filtering masks (such as the FFP2 grade), depend on knowing what the risk of social contact will be. The government indicated some aspects of Covid surveillance will remain, but with less reliable local data on infections and not having the ability to ask others to test before meeting, such personal choices are taken away from individuals. Once infected, lack of testing will ultimately reduce timely access to antivirals to prevent severe illness (which need to be taken as soon as possible after infection) and to long-term care if long Covid develops. The Sage group believes that part of the reason the peaks in July with Delta and this winter with Omicron were not higher is because people voluntarily restricted their behaviour over and above what was required by legislation. However, this “responsible” behaviour on the part of the public as a whole relies on everyone being able to see that there’s a potential problem. As testing, surveillance and reporting of infection rates are scaled back, this will be much more difficult, and it will be much less likely that enough people will change their behaviour at the same time to dampen down future waves. Almost a year ago I wrote about the danger of Covid becoming a disease of poverty. Under the new policies this danger is exacerbated. A vicious cycle will come into play: those in more deprived areas will be less able to afford to test; less able to afford to voluntarily self-isolate; more likely to live in poor, overcrowded housing and more likely to be crowded spaces outside the home thus more likely to infect others; less likely to be vaccinated but more likely to be in existing ill-health, and so more likely to fall seriously ill and die from Covid and develop long Covid. Ill-health then worsens families’ financial situation again and the cycle perpetuates. Despite the constant comparison to the flu, coronavirus is more infectious than flu and has worse health outcomes (both in terms of death and long-term ill-health). Simply adding it to our population without any policy adaptation may return us to what feels like normal life – but it will be a shorter and sicker one. There is also nodoubt that Omicron is not the last variant. As the virus continues to mutate, vaccine efficacy against infection wanes and public health measures are abandoned, it is likely that many people will catch it once or twice a year. This is likely to ultimately reduce overall life expectancy, where the steady gains seen over the last 70 years had already stalled between 2011 and 2018. Sudden waves of infection, like those seen last December and January, will put pressure on the NHS as we add a whole new disease to already challenging winter season. A sizeable percentage of the workforce getting sick at once will also – again – cause significant disruption across education, hospitality, transport and other work places. As for any communal problem, lasting remedies must be communal ones. Societies around the world did just this when they tackled passive smoking through anti-smoking legislation, pollution through environmental legislation and car accidents by drink-driving and road safety legislation. For coronavirus, this means research into better vaccines and treatments, understanding and preventing long Covid, infrastructure investment to support cleaner air, tackling inequalities across their whole range to improve population resilience, and a well-oiled national and global public health strategy that can spring into action when needed. The latter three will be effective against any future airborne pandemics. If we don’t want a world with more illness and death, we need to actively do something to prevent it.

2/22/2022,"The next time you’re in the city of Denton, Texas, you could do worse than swing by the speakeasy-style Paschall Bar, pull up a stool and order a Pulido Old Fashioned. “It’s my signature cocktail,” grins Midlake’s frontman Eric Pulido from under a well-worn baseball cap. “I think they just started getting tired of me saying: ‘Instead of the sugar can you do Bénédictine [a liqueur], and then can you also put in maple bitters … ’” Pulido isn’t simply a fussy customer, but alongside the rest of Midlake actually owns this dimly lit, book-lined boozer, which, like so many others, found itself on the brink of collapse during the early stages of the pandemic. “We experienced the up and down of ‘We’re good’, ‘We’re not’, ‘Now we’re OK!’” offers Pulido with a sigh. “It was definitely a trying time, but I feel like we’re coming out of the woods now.”  The same could be said for Midlake themselves, who have weathered other storms in their 20-odd-year existence. After a speedy rise following the eerie, timeless 2006 single Roscoe, the warmly experimental Texas folk-rockers found themselves riding the crest of a new wave of dreamy classic rock groups, leading to everything from Fleet Foxes’ folksy hymnals to Tame Impala’s swirling psychedelia. They followed their breakthrough second album, The Trials of Van Occupanther, with 2010’s The Courage of Others, switching their lens to the UK and drawing on the likes of Pentangle and Fairport Convention. The band’s seemingly breezy existence, however, hit a wall during sessions for their fourth album, with the acrimonious departure of their frontman and founding member Tim Smith. Rather than break up, the band scrapped everything they had worked on with Smith and started over, writing and recording 2013’s Antiphon with Pulido on lead vocals. “Part of it was just stubbornness after being hurt by your friend leaving and then saying: ‘Well, I’m not going to let his departure dictate what we’re going to do,’” explains Pulido. Although the record was met with giddy reviews that praised the band’s softer, more defined sound, after touring it, they decided to take a little break. That little break then became an extremely long break – so long that people started to ask: “Are Midlake, like, still a thing?” “We were kind of coy about it and said: ‘We’re on hiatus’ – or if a British person asked, we’d say: ‘We’re on holiday!’” confirms Pulido. “But it was definitely possible that we would never reconvene.” There was, of course, plenty of other stuff to be getting on with. After a solid run of festivals and world tours, there was the matter of raising families and getting stuck into solo projects. Pulido pursued his burgeoning interest in interior design, starting with the Paschall Bar, before working on a host of other restaurants in Denton. He also busied himself by forming the indie supergroup BNQT, which he branded “a poor man’s Travelling Wilburys” and featured Travis’s Fran Healy, Franz Ferdinand’s Alex Kapranos, Band of Horses’ Ben Bridwell and Grandaddy’s Jason Lytle. It was only in 2019 that the five members of Midlake tentatively began to reassemble. “There was this gradual and communal realisation that it would be a good idea to try at least,” says Pulido. “But it would have been naive for us to say: ‘We’re just going to pick up, and it’s all going to work and it’s gonna be great.’” After casually sharing early ideas, things properly got going when the first lockdown began in March 2020. “The silver lining was, we weren’t going anywhere, so we thought we might as well give it a go.” The result is the purposely proggy For the Sake of Bethel Woods, named after the site of 1969’s Woodstock festival. It was attended by 400,000 people, including a 16-year-old Dave Chandler, father of Midlake’s keyboard and flute player, Jesse Chandler. After his dad passed away in 2018, Jesse saw him in a dream; he suggested that Midlake start working together again. As a tribute, a painting of Dave at Woodstock – inspired by a shot of the teenage Dave that features in the legendary 1970 documentary about the festival – now graces the album’s cover. “It’s probably the most poetic and beautiful inspiration for us getting back together,” says Pulido. “A big part of it, at least for me, was just missing my friends.” The result is a deeply dynamic record and one that has the broadest scope of influences of any Midlake album to date, a natural result of nine years spent simply listening. “Seventies west coast folk-rock is always going to be a part of our Midlake DNA, but to feel like you can pull from a jazz background and also go to more modern places was really freeing and refreshing,” says Pulido. The band’s time apart also made Pulido keen to be much more open in his songwriting, digging into deeply personal stories including on the gentle Noble, a song named in honour of drummer McKenzie Smith’s son Garrett Noble Smith, who was born in 2019 with the rare brain disorder semi-lobar holoprosencephaly. “We just want to be more honest about who we are and things that might be happening, especially in a time of such shared struggle and loss,” says Pulido. There’s even been something of a reconciliation with Smith, who now lives in North Carolina and makes music under the name Harp. “We still keep in touch – and who knows what could happen in the future?” Is he saying they may one day make music together again? “I definitely would consider that,” he says. “Stranger things have happened. I wouldn’t put it out of the realm of possibility.” So now that Midlake are back in their groove, can we expect album No 6 to come a little quicker than album No 5? “We’ve never been a prolific band and, for better or worse, we’ve never felt the obligation to say: ‘OK, we’ve got to follow this up with a hit single or a song that sounds like this hot thing that’s going on right now,’” confesses Pulido. “But I feel like we’re in a place that’s much more sustainable now.” A cause for Pulido Old Fashioneds all round.

2/22/2022,"Carlos Corberán leans forward ever so slightly, pinches his thumb and index finger together and begins to make a rather compelling case. He is fielding a question about Huddersfield’s players being weighed before training and whether his meticulous ways were inspired by two years working alongside Marcelo Bielsa at Leeds. For Corberán, a perfectionist and almost obsessive head coach, there is no such thing as a marginal gain. “There aren’t any small details,” he says. “Every action can be the key one. We don’t know which one is going to be the key one. We have to place the same importance on every one.” Corberán rattles off a few examples – “driving one more yard can be the difference between allowing the opponent to counterattack, because you lose the ball, or getting past a defender and passing to a teammate to score” – and cites Danny Ward’s hat-trick – and winning – goal at Reading last month when the striker won an aerial duel five seconds before blasting a shot into the top corner. Ward opened the scoring in victory at Championship leaders Fulham on Saturday and after 45 minutes in Corberán’s company it is easy to understand why Huddersfield are flying. They are fifth in the league and face Nottingham Forest for a place in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup. First, however, they will attempt to extend their unbeaten run to 16 matches at home to Cardiff on Wednesday.  It is 4.15pm and there is a moody sky at Huddersfield’s Canalside training base and though the pitches behind Corberán are empty, he is at his desk fine-tuning preparations. Corberán has been known to challenge his players, be it arranging meetings hours after training, not adhering to regular days off, or wanting them to be as lean as humanly possible. His approach appears to be working. “Training has to help us create habits,” he says. “For me, the moment of the game is maybe the moment where they have to think less but play more. But play the right way. And to play the right way, you need to process, you need to work, you need to analyse, and you need to understand the game situations that allow you when you’re on the pitch to just play. “Everything that we want to watch on a pitch at the weekend, we need to see and watch on the pitch on the training ground every single day. For me, football is a question of habit.” Corberán is as he is on the touchline – intense and animated – and training tends to be at full tilt too, especially during “Murderball”, a gruelling drill synonymous with Bielsa where fouls are allowed to run and the ball effectively never goes out of play. Corberán has a doctorate in football, completing a thesis on the philosophy of Juanma Lillo, an assistant to Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, and his hunger to improve often results in long days. “I don’t like to go home with work to do. I like to be at the training ground until I finish … it can be 7pm, 8pm. We think we have a big opportunity and we want to try to use it the best we can.” Home remains in Leeds, where he was appointed Under-23s coach in July 2017 – after spells in Cyprus, Saudi Arabia and in his homeland, Spain, with Villarreal – and later first-team coach under Bielsa, who once said he valued Corberán’s opinion more than his own. “It is one of the few things – or maybe the only thing – that I don’t agree with him on. I cannot accept these types of words. It is not true.” They would agree on the importance of humility, though. “In life our ego can kill us more than help us,” Corberán says. “Football challenges you every single day. Every time you are facing a challenge, you have the opportunity to grow and to add new knowledge. So I hope that today I will be a worse coach than I am tomorrow,” he says, smiling. Huddersfield’s head of football operations and former academy manager, Leigh Bromby, a former Leeds defender, was impressed with Corberán’s side in an Under-23s game between the teams and moved for him in July 2020 after sacking Danny Cowley. Almost five years in England is rubbing off on Corberán. “When I was in Spain I was having dinner around 10pm but now I am more British, around 8pm,” smiles the 38-year-old, who was born in Cheste, near Valencia. “This country is very cosmopolitan. You have Italian, Japanese, Spanish restaurants – everything. I found a place that has paella, which is typical of my city, so I’m not missing anything.” The starting lineup at Fulham was assembled for little more than £1m, with the goalkeeper Lee Nicholls, Matty Pearson, who has been given the nickname “Keighley Cannavaro”, Ollie Turton and Tom Lees, all of whom joined on frees last summer, key to improving a team who finished 20th with the division’s worst defensive record last season. Sorba Thomas, for whom they paid a modest fee, is arguably the star of a team led by the midfielder Lewis O’Brien, who progressed through the academy. Huddersfield are not stacked with household names but shrewd recruits. “They have created one culture,” Corberán says. “I remember in some of my speeches last year before the game I was talking a lot but this year I’m listening to my players before we all go to the pitch. They are ready to compete for their teammates every time.”",Sport/Football,Huddersfield’s Carlos Corberán: ‘Our ego can kill us more than help us’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2022/feb/22/huddersfield-manager-carlos-corberan-promotion-bielsa
2/22/2022,"Regional Australia has experienced record levels of growth across housing and rental markets in the last 12 months, according to a new report, as locals say the rising demand has priced them out. NAB’s Regional Migration Impacts on Property Report, released on Tuesday, found “the continued flow of new arrivals into regional areas has placed an unprecedented level of upward pressure on property values, with many locations now experiencing dwelling values at new record levels”.  House prices rose most sharply in the southern highlands and Shoalhaven region in New South Wales, with an increase of over 38% in the 12 months to the end of January 2022, according to the report. Julie Rynski, an executive at NAB for regional and agribusiness, said “underlining the unprecedented level of growth across the past 12 months, 24 out of Australia’s 25 largest non-capital city regions have experienced double-digit annual growth for houses”. The report found the median dwelling value across the combined regions jumped over 26% in the year to January 2022, compared to 21.3% across capital cities for the same period. It said strong buyer demand continued to “far outweigh” supply levels. Rynski said it was a similar story in the rental market. The highest surge in housing rental values was seen in the Murray region of NSW around Albury-Wodonga which was up almost 25% on the same time last year. Emily Lightfoot, an accountant and single mother in Albury, said she was lucky her rental accomodation had not gone up since 2019 but she feared that if she was to lose the property she’s in, she’d be left homeless. “I have observed other people in the area who have lived here their whole lives becoming homeless,” she said. Lightfoot said, although the influx of people from Melbourne and Sydney during Covid had exacerbated the situation, the problem was not new. When she left a relationship in 2017 and had to secure her own rental accommodation, she was told the waiting list in the area for public housing was 20 years. Due to health problems, Lightfoot relies on Centrelink for living expenses, while she runs a small accounting business to cover her registration and insurance costs. “If I lose my accommodation, I’ll lose my business as well, as I have nowhere to set up my laptop and photocopier,” Lightfoot said. She said rents had “gone through the roof”, which had seen locals pushed out as people from the capital cities with more buying power were securing properties by offering to pay more rent than advertised. Lightfoot said the issue was drawing more attention as it’s now not just affecting low-income people but also middle Australia. Before Covid she said it was not something that would have come up in casual conversation but now it was a common topic to discuss “the number of people camping down by the river” The NAB report also noted that rental prices on the Gold Coast, where there had been record low vacancy rates of 0.6%, had jumped by nearly 20%, while the southern part of Western Australia’s outback had experienced a 16% increase “heavily linked with the booming mining sector”. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter The report also showed that on a local government area basis, the Byron shire on the NSW north coast had the highest median house value of any regional LGA, with an average price of nearly $1,850,000, an increase of 30.2%. Houses in the Kiama LGA, also in NSW, recorded the greatest increase, with a 43.9% uplift in the past 12 months. “High-population coastal centres close to capital cities continue to be the main destinations for capital-city dwellers making a regional move,” the report said. Looking ahead, the NAB report anticipated the pace of migration of capital city residents to regional areas would slow. “While the affordability, lifestyle and strong infrastructure will continue to pull more capital city residents to the regions, the reintroduction of overseas travel, with borders reopening … and the willingness of many to travel domestically also, is expected to see a moderation in regional migration,” the report said.",News/Australia news,House prices and rents surge in regional Australia amid influx of arrivals from cities,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/22/house-prices-and-rents-surge-in-regional-australia-amid-influx-of-arrivals-from-cities
