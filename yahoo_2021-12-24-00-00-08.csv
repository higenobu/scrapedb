12/24/2021,"Former President Donald Trump is continuing to advocate for COVID-19 vaccination. In an interview with conservative commentator Candace Owens, Trump called the COVID-19 vaccines ""one of the greatest achievements of mankind"" after he revealed earlier this week he received his booster dose. Owens suggested the fact that ""more people have died"" since the vaccines became widely available might call their effectiveness into question, but Trump rejected this notion. ""No, the vaccine worked,"" he said. ""But some people aren't taking it. The ones that get very sick and go to the hospital are the ones that don't take their vaccine."" Trump went on to say that ""if you take the vaccine, you're protected,"" and ""if you do"" still get COVID-19 while vaccinated, ""it's a very minor form"" of it. He added, ""People aren't dying when they take their vaccine."" The comments came after Trump said at an event with former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly that he received his COVID-19 booster dose. This prompted some boos from the crowd, but Trump told his supporters they should ""take credit"" for the vaccines and that by being against vaccines, ""you're playing right into their hands."" While in office, Trump declined to get vaccinated in public like then-Vice President Mike Pence did, and it was only revealed that Trump received his vaccine at the White House nearly two months later. President Biden during a speech earlier this week praised Trump for his comments about getting a booster dose, saying this ""may be one of the few things he and I agree on,"" and he also thanked the efforts of ""the prior administration"" on vaccines. Trump later told Fox News he was ""very appreciative"" of Biden's comments. ""It has to be a process of healing in this country,"" Trump said, ""and that will help a lot."" Biden tries a harsher COVID message It's unrealistic to ban football. But it might not be ethical to watch it, either.

12/24/2021,"Ohio changed a whole bunch of new rules for brewing, serving and selling alcohol. Gov. Mike DeWine signed Senate Bill 102 Wednesday, a liquor reform bill that changed everything from the legal age for serving alcohol to the number of signatures needed to get a Sunday sales question on the ballot. Here's what the new law will do when it goes into effect in 90 days: Ohioans who are 18 years or older will be legally allowed to serve alcohol when the bill becomes law. The current age for carrying open containers is 19. ""This is something the restaurants asked us to do,"" said Sen. Kristina Roegner, R-Hudson. The majority of U.S. states, including New York, Pennsylvania and Michigan, set the age to serve liquor at 18. With staffing shortages plaguing Ohio's entire service industry, this just made sense, Roegner said. The COVID-19 pandemic made Designated Outdoor Drinking Areas or DORAs popular this summer and now SB 102 is going to make them bigger. Instead of three categories, the law divides cities and townships into those above or below 50,000 people. Municipalities above the line will be able to designate 640 acres for DORAs (double the current limit). And they can spread that acreage across six different locations instead of four. Cities with populations below 50,000 will be able to use 320 acres as DORAs across three locations, which can be clustered together around a group of bars or restaurants with liquor licenses. ""Communities like them. Businesses love them,"" Roegner said. ""This seems to be going really well."" Former Gov. Bob Taft rolled back Ohio’s Prohibition-era ban on Sunday liquor sales in 2004, and communities across the state have voted to legalize sales ever since. To get on the ballot, stores had to gather valid signatures totaling 35% of the people who voted in the last governor's race in their precinct. SB 102 lowers the number of signatures to 50. That's the number of signatures state lawmakers need to get on the ballot, but this change got a lot of pushback from companies who already hold permits to sell spirits on Sundays. ""I genuinely don’t believe this is the last we’re going to hear about it,"" said Bob Young, who runs a company called Why I See that helps businesses get on the ballot. ""It’s going to be, 'Well, let’s just do this, or let’s just get rid of this. It’s only 50. Why have people go through it?'"" The law will also allow these local option elections on primary election days even if there is no primary being held. SB 102 started out as a bill to make it easier for people who brew alcohol as a hobby to get together and share their knowledge. The law clarifies that it's legal for Ohioans to brew their own concoctions, enter them in tasting competitions and share them at local club gatherings. ""These types of events allow homebrewers who aspire to enter the professional brewing arena a chance to have their beers, ciders and meads evaluated by their peers,"" Fat Head's Brewery co-owner Matt Cole said. ""It allows them to receive valuable feedback before making decisions to embark on a professional brewery career."" The law also lets bars, restaurants and distilleries host these clubs providing they notify the Division of Liquor Control in advance, suspend their own license for the sections being used and clearly separate their alcohol from the homebrews. Homebrewers are not allowed to sell their products at these events but groups can charge entry fees. It turns out that Ohio law limits the percentage customers can spend on alcohol if they're paying with a restaurant gift card to 30%. ""That surprised me,"" Roegner said. Her bill simply crossed out the limit in Ohio Revised Code, freeing customers up to spend their gift cards on booze. Charities that auction off bottles of wine or whiskey are technically breaking the law in Ohio. SB 102 will make it legal though. The bill allows a political or charitable organization to give away -- without a permit -- beer, wine or liquor as a fundraising prize under certain conditions. For example, the organization will have to submit recipes for the alcohol to Ohio's liquor division and the booze will have to be bought from ""from an Ohio-based agency store.""

12/24/2021,"Elon Musk said his wealth ""isn't some deep mystery"" and that his taxes are ""super simple."" He told The Babylon Bee he doesn't use tax-avoidance schemes, offshore accounts, or tax shelters. The tech billionaire recently clashed with Sen. Warren, who accused him of ""freeloading"" over taxes. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk says he doesn't use any tax-avoidance schemes, offshore accounts, or tax shelters. Instead, his taxes are ""super simple,"" he told conservative Christian satire site The Babylon Bee in an interview published Wednesday. Musk's comments came less than two weeks after he clashed with Senator Elizabeth Warren on Twitter. The Democratic senator had accused him of ""freeloading"" over taxes after he was named Time's Person of the Year, and Musk snapped back by calling Warren ""Senator Karen."" Speaking about the feud in his interview with The Babylon Bee, Musk said he was ""literally paying the most tax that any individual in history has ever paid this year"" and that Warren ""doesn't pay any taxes, basically at all."" ""If you could die by irony, she would be dead,"" he added, explaining that Warren's salary and taxes were paid for by taxpayers. Insider previously reported that the Internal Revenue Service does not publicly disclose the tax information of individuals, making it difficult to know whether Musk is paying the largest tax bill in history, as he claims. But if Musk chooses to exercise all his Tesla share options expiring in 2022, the taxes on these could exceed $10 billion for this year, according to calculations by Bloomberg. Musk, who currently tops the Bloomberg Billionaires Index with a net worth of $261 billion, told The Babylon Bee that he could do his taxes himself ""in a few hours."" ""My taxes are super simple,"" Musk said. ""I do not have any offshore accounts, I don't have any tax shelters."" He added that there were ""no elaborate tax avoidance schemes or anything like that."" Musk told the publication that he owned stock in both Tesla and SpaceX and that everything was ""extremely transparent."" He said that his worth was calculated by multiplying his ownership percentage of the two companies by their valuations. ""My so-called wealth, it's not some deep mystery,"" Musk said. He added that he doesn't take salaries or bonuses from the companies because he thought it would be ""morally good to not do that."" ""My cash balances are very, very low, at least until I sold stock,"" Musk said. ""I simply had loans against my stock, so if Tesla and SpaceX went bankrupt, I would go bankrupt too, immediately."" Musk has sold $15.4 billion in Tesla shares since asking Twitter on November 6 to vote on whether he should divest 10% of his stake, and said Wednesday that he was ""almost done"" selling stock. He told The Babylon Bee that this quarter was the first time he sold stock ""in any meaningful way."" In the interview, Musk also poked fun at the metaverse and criticized California, the state he moved both Tesla and his personal residence from. Musk told The Babylon Bee that the state used to be the land of opportunity but was now known for over-regulation, over-litigation, and over-taxation.

12/24/2021,"A two-day undercover operation resulted in 11 arrests at a southeast Oklahoma City park and police are now increasing surveillance of the area. Eleven men were arrested at Trosper Park on SE 29 Street from Dec. 16 to Dec. 17. According to police reports, all 11 suspects were arrested for public indecency or ""acts of lewd behavior."" The Oklahoma City Police Department Vice Enforcement Unit conducted the undercover operation after receiving numerous citizen complaints of criminal sexual acts occurring at the metro park. Trosper Park, 2300 SE 29, has gained a reputation for casual sex and hook-ups since the 1970s. ""We're not trying to single any particular group out, but you cannot be engaging in this type of behavior out in the open,"" said Oklahoma City Police Sgt. Gary Knight. According to police reports, detectives posing as visitors parked their vehicles in a lot where other drivers would engage with them. In one case, a vehicle circled a detective's car, the driver signaling for the undercover officer to follow him to another part of the park. Other individuals were seen ""performing lewd acts"" in parked cars and near a playground. In each case, arrests were made without incident, and any involved vehicles were impounded. ""This is a place where we repeatedly have to go to to address this issue,"" Knight said. ""We're going to have undercover officers there from time to time, and if you choose to go out there and engage in this type of activity, you may just be right there with an undercover police officer and you may be facing arrest because of it.""
