3/22/2022,"Good morning. Russia’s false accusation that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons is a “clear sign” that a desperate Vladimir Putin is considering using them himself, Joe Biden has said. The US president said Putin’s “back is against the wall and now he’s talking about new false flags he’s setting up including, asserting that we in America have biological as well as chemical weapons in Europe – simply not true. I guarantee you,” Biden said at an event on Monday. “They are also suggesting that Ukraine has biological and chemical weapons in Ukraine. That’s a clear sign he’s considering using both of those. He’s already used chemical weapons in the past, and we should be careful of what’s about to come.” Putin “knows there’ll be severe consequences because of the united Nato front,” he said, without specifying what actions the alliance would take. What is going on with the peace negotiations? The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for direct talks with his Russian counterpart as the key to ending the war. He said direct talks “in any format” were now needed. Is Russia targeting journalists? A reporter describes life under siege in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol and why it is so important to break the silence. “The Russians were hunting us down. They had a list of names, including ours, and they were closing in,” says Mstyslav Chernov. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 27 of the invasion. Ketanji Brown Jackson promised to defend the US constitution and what she called the “grand experiment of American democracy” in her opening remarks to the Senate confirmation hearings that could see her become the first Black woman to sit on the US supreme court since it was created 233 years ago. Jackson, 51, addressed the Senate judiciary committee on Monday at the start of four days of potentially bruising partisan wrangling over her nomination. She struck a conciliatory tone, stressing her ideological neutrality. “I have been a judge for nearly a decade and I take my responsibility to be independent very seriously,” she told the 22 senators in front of her. “I decide cases from a neutral posture.” The nominee talked of the “historic chance” to be the first Black woman on the supreme court – but first she had to listen to a lot of white men. The Missouri Republican Josh Hawley is wrong to attack Jackson, and should be ignored in confirmation hearings this week, the Senate judiciary chair said. The Texas senator Ted Cruz complained that the supreme court confirmation hearings have become increasingly angry and confrontational. His comments came the day after he was filmed becoming confrontational at an airport in Montana. About an hour into its journey from Kunming to Guangzhou, flight MU5735 fell out of the air. After cruising at an altitude of 29,100ft, it suddenly dropped to about 7,000ft where it briefly ascended before diving again and crashing into remote bamboo forest in the mountains near Wuzhou. The fall appears to have taken around two minutes, according to flight tracking data. “The plane did not smoke during the fall,” a witness told the Beijing Youth Daily. “The fire started after it fell into the mountain, followed by a lot of smoke.” Villagers reported the sound of explosions and a raging fire. Some locals raced to the scene ahead of hundreds of fire and rescue personnel – and reportedly local militia groups – travelling the final distance on foot via a dirt trail. Did anyone survive? There has been no official announcement on the death toll, but state media has reported there were no signs of survivors. The flight was carrying 132 people, including nine crew. Is there any indication of what caused the crash? It’s too early to say. The plane’s black box has yet to be located. Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh have welcomed the announcement by the US that it considers the violent repression of their largely Muslim ethnic group in Myanmar a genocide. “We are very happy on the declaration of the genocide; many, many thanks,” said 60-year-old Sala Uddin, who lives at Kutupalong camp. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has said she should have been released from detention in Iran six years ago and urged an end to the detention of other dual nationals still held in the country, saying without their release “the meaning of freedom is never going to be complete”. Hundreds of Chevron workers in California went on strike Monday after the company and the United Steelworkers union failed to reach a contract agreement. More than 500 workers at a refinery producing gasoline, diesel and jet fuel and lubricating oils began striking at 12.01am. Donald Trump and his two eldest children continued their fight to overturn a decision requiring the former president to answer questions under oath as part of an investigation into his business practices, filing fresh paperwork yesterday that accused a New York judge of abusing his discretion in issuing the decision. More than $17bn (£13bn) of global assets – including offshore bank accounts, yachts, private jets and luxury properties in London, Tuscany and the French Riviera – have been linked to 35 oligarchs and Russian officials alleged to have close ties to Vladimir Putin. Today, the Guardian, working in a partnership with the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and other international news organisations, is unveiling the initial research in an ongoing project. The right wing in America has spent the past 18 months waging an increasingly vocal war on education, banning books and restricting the discussions teachers can have in classrooms, usually when it comes to issues like racism or sexuality. That could be starting to change, however, as progressives have won a series of victories in some states, suggesting a backlash against censorship in education could be on the way, writes Adam Gabbatt. America is looking to fully reopen – to get back to “normal” – and it’s clear that company leaders still want the old version of the all-American work ethic that was dependent on hustle culture and productivity. But is that incompatible with who we’ve become – and, more importantly, the realities of the world in which we live? Many of us have drastically changed. It’s not just our attitudes towards work and life, but also that our bodies are reacting differently to trauma, stress and even love, writes Alvin Chang. Rich countries must end all oil and gas production in the next 12 years, while the poorest nations should be given 28 years, to provide a fair transition away from fossil fuels, according to a study. The report found that wealthy countries such as the UK, US and Australia had until 2034 to stop all oil and gas production to give the world a 50% chance of preventing devastating climate breakdown, while the poorest nations that are also heavily reliant on fossil fuels should be given until 2050. Many crimes have been committed in the name of paella but now researchers in Valencia have laid down 10 commandments of what thou shall and shall not put in their national dish after questioning 400 amateur chefs aged over 50 from 266 Valencian villages.

3/22/2022,"It was the collective sense of purpose and unity that was most striking as France collected their grand chelem and rose to second in the world rankings. In the past they would suffer a setback and often allow it to distract them. Now they have everything a champion rugby team need: talent, power and, crucially, composure. Only in Wales, where the fear of a Friday night slip-up briefly diverted them down a tactical cul‑de‑sac, did their most influential players show any signs of confusion. The clarity of their gameplan was a lesson to other teams and previously unsung players such as Gabin Villière, Melvyn Jaminet and Jonathan Danty have stepped up to complement the bigger names around them. Shaun Edwards’s defensive urgings have also made a massive difference and the French public are swooning. By the time the World Cup kicks off in Paris in 2023, they may be firm favourites. By most measures Ireland had a productive season. Their tally of 24 tries was the second highest in Six Nations history - albeit boosted by a field day against a 13-man Italy - and they also conceded only four in five games, the fewest in the tournament. There is absolutely no shame, either, in losing in Paris against quality French opposition. In Hugo Keenan, Josh van der Flier and Caelan Doris they had unflashy players who would all be on the plane if a Lions tour was coming up. There remains a sense, though, that a more reliable gauge of their World Cup readiness will be the Test series in New Zealand this summer. Winning at home – or away against a 14-man England – is all very well but another level will be required to beat the All Blacks in their own backyard. They look a more formidable pack with Rónan Kelleher and Andrew Porter on the field but Tadhg Beirne, Jamison Gibson-Park and Michael Lowry add a dash of something different and there are plenty of youngsters awaiting a chance. Only Italy scored fewer tries than England, who lost three of their five games for the second Six Nations in a row. People still harking back to their 2019 World Cup final appearance need to wake up and realise they are now appreciably behind France and Ireland. Ellis Genge, Marcus Smith, Freddie Steward and Alex Dombrandt will all learn plenty from this tournament but England rarely have the set-piece dominance or midfield line-breakers to allow Smith to weave the kind of spells he does for Harlequins. Nor is asking Genge to truck it up repeatedly from his own 22 going to concern top-class opposition. Alfie Barbeary is a name to watch while Henry Arundell has scored some blistering tries for the under-20s but, with only 12 Tests between now and the World Cup, the window for experimentation is closing fast. Considering the squad at their disposal and an upbeat start to the tournament, Scotland’s subsequent decline has to be a concern. Worse things happen than players having a couple of beers after a win but trust between players and management seems to be fraying again and any positivity has rapidly evaporated. The good news is that Cameron Redpath is a class player and will enhance Scotland’s attacking options, while Rory Darge looks to have a long and fruitful Scotland career ahead of him. Jamie Ritchie will make a difference when he is fit and may yet assume the captaincy if Gregor Townsend feels a change of leadership is required. Ultimately, though, Scotland were subdued by a moderate Wales and lost comfortably against France and Ireland. Even against England at Murrayfield they took a long time to get going; their summer tour to Argentina suddenly feels hugely significant. Of all the head coaches currently under pressure, Wayne Pivac has the most to worry about. Having contrived to lose at home against Italy for the first time, his side are facing the daunting prospect of a three-Test summer series against the world champions South Africa. Their injury list should have eased by then but the spirit that earned a win against Scotland and ran England close at Twickenham needs to be allied to more forward dynamism and smarter thinking. When the captain, Dan Biggar, suggested “it might be the last chance for a lot of players” after the Italy defeat he was speaking against a backdrop of disappointing age‑group and regional results and financial uncertainty, none of which is making Pivac’s job any easier. Reasons to be cheerful? The lovely gesture from Josh Adams, who handed his man of the match medal to Italian opponent Ange Capuozzo, and the character in adversity of Will Rowlands and Nick Tompkins. As the dust settles on their Cardiff carnival, the end‑of‑season list that will give Italy most heart is the U20 championship table. Three wins in five matches – against England, Wales and Scotland – is another sign of better times ahead and the young players now involved in the senior squad seem determined to give it a proper rattle. Capuozzo will not create miracle tries every week but his have-a-go enthusiasm is infectious and Kieran Crowley seems to be instilling more belief. Michele Lamaro’s captaincy, particularly in impossible circumstances against Ireland, was impressive and Monty Ioane proved a threat on the wing. The Azzurri can finally look everyone in the eye and insist the Six Nations would be a poorer place without them. This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

3/22/2022,"Songbird Farm’s 17 acres (7 hectares) hold sandy loam fields, three greenhouses, and cutover woods that comprise an idyllic setting near Maine’s central coast. The small organic operation carved out a niche growing heirloom grains, tomatoes, sweet garlic, cantaloupe and other products that were sold to organic food stores or as part of a community-supported agriculture program, where people pay to receive boxes of locally grown produce. Farmers Johanna Davis and Adam Nordell bought Songbird in 2014. By 2021 the young family with their three-year-old son were hitting their stride, Nordell said. But disaster struck in December. The couple learned the farm’s previous owner had decades earlier used PFAS-tainted sewage sludge, or “biosolids”, as fertilizer on Songbird’s fields. Testing revealed their soil, drinking water, irrigation water, crops, chickens and blood were contaminated with high levels of the toxic chemicals. The couple quickly recalled products, alerted customers, suspended their operation and have been left deeply fearful for their financial and physical well being. “This has flipped everything about our lives on its head,” Nordell said. “We haven’t done a blood test on our kid yet and that’s the most terrifying part. It’s fucking devastating.” Public health advocates say Songbird is just the tip of the iceberg as Maine faces a brewing crisis stemming from the use of biosolids as fertilizer. The state has begun investigating more than 700 properties for PFAS contamination. Few results are in yet but several farmers’ independent testing revealed high PFAS levels, and statewide contamination has disrupted about 10 farms. Farmers who spoke with the Guardian say other growers have admitted to hiding PFAS contamination because they fear economic ruin. Maine is hardly alone. It is finding more contamination because it’s doing more testing, experts say. All sludge contains some level of PFAS, and farms across the country have increasingly used the substance as fertilizer in recent decades. Michigan, one of the only other states to monitor biosolids and to testagricultural products, recently discovered PFAS-contaminated beef. “Many other states are going to be facing what Maine is facing now,” said Nancy Raine, secretary for Sierra Club’s wastewater residuals team. “Who is responsible for the harm done – the loss of livelihoods and property values?” PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 9,000 compounds used to make products heat-, water- or stain-resistant. Known as “forever chemicals” because they don’t naturally break down, they have been linked to cancer, thyroid disruption, liver problems, birth defects, immunosuppression and more. Dozens of industries use PFAS in thousands of consumer products, and often discharge the chemicals into the nation’s sewer system. Sludge is a by-product of the wastewater treatment process that’s a mix of human excrement and any number of more than 90,000 human-made chemicals or substances discharged from industry’s pipes. “It’s a toxic soup” said Laura Orlando, a Boston University civil engineer who studies sludge contamination. Sludge is expensive to landfill but as human excrement holds nitrogen, phosphorus and other plant nutrients, it’s often lightly treated, marketed as “biosolids” and sold or given to farmers who view it as a cost-saving fertilizer. Maine’s unfolding crisis is prompting fresh calls to ban the practice and PFAS. In July, the state’s government became the world’s first to approve a near ban of PFAS, and a proposal to prohibit biosolids that haven’t been tested for PFAS is moving through the Maine legislature. Meanwhile, farmers in financial ruin are demanding an aid package including immediate emergency relief funds, funding to help them move to a new income source and lifelong health monitoring. “It’s going to be expensive but the state signed these sludge licenses and we can’t wait,” Nordell said. “Our businesses are in limbo right now, our lives are in limbo.” Nordell and Davis bought Songbird in 2014 from a man who had been on the land for about 25 years but was dying of pancreatic cancer and wanted to ensure the farm he built lived on. The man suspected his cancer stemmed from his time as a grad student testing pesticides, Nordell said, and Maine’s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) told Nordell that pancreatic cancer isn’t linked to PFAS. Although studies have found links between PFAS and pancreatic cancer. “That’s a data point in the story that scares me,” Nordell said, adding that PFAS levels in his and Davis’s blood are higher than those found in employees who worked for PFAS manufacturers. The farm’s PFAS levels are also alarming. Maine’s water limit on six kinds of PFAS is 20 parts per trillion (ppt), while levels at Songbird were 8,000 ppt. The state set sludge limits between 2.5 parts per billion (ppb) and 5.2 ppb – Songbird recorded levels in its soil as high as 475 ppb. Additionally, PFAS can spread. Ironwood Farm, about six miles from Songbird, tested its water and found high levels suspected to have migrated from a neighbors’ sludge-packed field. The small produce farm pulled its products, halted operations and is nervously awaiting more test results. “I spent my entire adult life building this farm,” said Nell Finnigan, an Ironwood farmer. “Everything is at stake for us, and this is a tragedy for anyone who comes up with a high well test.” Regulation is complicated by a hesitancy to disrupt the agricultural industry and a lack of federal limits for PFAS in food. Though Maine’s agricultural department established standards for beef and milk, they only monitor one out of thousands of kinds of PFAS. Public health advocates say the limits should be lower and more PFAS compounds should be included in testing. After Stoneridge Farm, a small dairy operation more than 100 miles south of Songbird, discovered in 2016 that sludge and paper mill waste used as fertilizer had likely contaminated its cows and milk, the state developed limits for two kinds of PFAS in sludge. Subsequent testing found about 95% of Maine’s sludge exceeded the limits. In response, the DEP in 2019 developed new restrictions for spreading sludge on farmland. One rule permitted spreading if the combined sludge and clean soil’s PFAS levels didn’t exceed state sludge limits. Patrick MacRoy, deputy director of Defend Our Health Maine called the policy “ridiculous” because it allowed clean fields to be contaminated with PFAS. A second rule allowed sludge to be composted and spread on fields or home gardens, even though compost is sometimes as much as 100% sludge, MacRoy said. “They created two gigantic loopholes,” he added. After a bill to close the loopholes was introduced this year in the Maine legislature, state Senator Stacy Brenner proposed an amendment to ban the practice altogether. “It seems prudent at this point to end land application of biosolids,” she said. As the sludge ban gains momentum, Maine’s largest waste management company, Casella Waste Systems, and some wastewater treatment facilities, have responded by saying that the state doesn’t have enough room in its landfills for more sludge and that the ban will increase customers’ water and sewer bills. Landfilling sludge is a problem, said Joe Fusco, Casella vice president, because its storage requires more material as a bulking agent and that’s going to “take up scarce landfill space”. The DEP told the legislature the substance currently takes up about 9% of the state’s landfills and that would increase to about 12% under the new rules. Federal money could help control utilities’ costs, Brenner said, as would a proposal to eliminate a new fee that utilities would have to pay and is slated to go into effect soon. Brenner believes Casella’s opposition is about its profits, as the company has a big composting operation . “They have shareholders to answer to. The dance is what it always is”. Fusco said the claim that Casella is only concerned about its shareholders is “a gross oversimplification” that ignores the larger issue of how to get PFAS out of the waste system. “Yes, we’re in business and we have an interest in maintaining our business, but to have a bill that makes Maine a hostile place to us is not the answer,” Fusco said. In the meantime, farmers struggle. Stoneridge killed most of its livestock in 2019. Co-owner Fred Stone was denied federal assistance for his tainted milk because one of its milk tests came in just below the state’s limit, but Stone didn’t feel comfortable selling it. Now his family of four, which believes PFAS is behind their health ailments from thyroid disease to reproductive problems, survives on welfare and friends’ and family’s generosity. Stone said he could have continued to sell contaminated food: “This is the cost of having a moral compass and doing the right thing”. “I don’t know how we are going to get debts paid,” he added. “I don’t know how the Christ we are going to live. I don’t know how we’re going to survive.”",News/Environment,‘I don’t know how we’ll survive’: the farmers facing ruin in America’s ‘forever chemicals’ crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/22/i-dont-know-how-well-survive-the-farmers-facing-ruin-in-americas-forever-chemicals-crisis
3/22/2022,"When California shut down in March 2020, advocates for unhoused people thought the state might finally be forced to solve its homelessness crisis. To slow the spread of Covid, they hoped, officials would have to provide people living outside with stable and private shelter and housing. But in the two years since, California’s humanitarian catastrophe has worsened: deaths of people on the streets are rising; college students are living in their cars; more elderly residents are becoming unhoused; encampment communities are growing at beaches, parks, highway underpasses, lots and sidewalks. California has the fifth largest economy in the world, a budget surplus, the most billionaires in the US and some of the nation’s wealthiest neighborhoods. Yet the riches of the Golden State have not yielded solutions that match the scale of the crisis that’s been raging for decades. Pandemic-era programs have had some success for a slice of the unhoused population, but many measures have fallen short. Meanwhile, homelessness has become the top issue in political races. Polls in Los Angeles, which is home to 40% of the state’s unhoused population, suggest that a majority of voters want their governments to act faster, and that residents are angered by the immense human suffering caused by a seemingly intractable crisis. ​​ In response, governments across the state are increasingly cracking down on people sleeping outside. Out of the 20 largest cities in California, the majority have either passed or proposed new laws banning camping in certain places or have ramped up encampment sweeps. LA and Oakland passed laws meant to prohibit camping in certain zones; San Francisco’s mayor has pushed for a police crackdown on unhoused people using drugs in the Tenderloin neighborhood; Fresno adopted a law to fine people up to $250 for entering certain restricted areas; and Modesto, Bakersfield and Riverside are pushing to expand the number of park rangers in an effort to enforce anti-camping rules and related restrictions. Some unhoused people and civil rights activists warn that those escalating efforts to force people off the streets are only further hurting the most vulnerable. “We have failed in so many respects,” said Theo Henderson, a Los Angeles advocate for the unhoused, who was himself living outside until recently. “There are families with children living in automobiles. There are elderly and the infirm on the streets … It’s a dark time right now, and unhoused residents are very afraid.” In a new series that will be published over the next several months, Guardian US is examining California’s homelessness crisis across the state. While homelessness remains concentrated in major metro areas like Los Angeles, San Jose, the San Francisco Bay area and San Diego, communities from the north to the Mexico border are facing their own emergencies. California counted 161,548 unhoused people in the state in January 2020, the most recent count data available. The count is a “point in time” estimate that tallies people living on the street or in shelters. Since it’s a rough snapshot of a single day, and doesn’t account for people who are hidden from public view or are unhoused but couch-surfing that night, it is considered a significant undercount. At least 113,660 of those counted were classified as “unsheltered”, making California home to more than half of all people without shelter in America and the only state where more than 70% of the homeless population is unsheltered (by comparison, just 5% of New York’s homeless population was unsheltered. The consequences of so many people living outside are severe and fatal. In 2015, the LA county coroner’s office recorded 613 deaths of unhoused people. That number has steadily climbed each year, rising to 1,609 fatalities in 2021, a spokesperson said. Those figures are an undercount, because the coroner only tracks fatalities considered sudden, unusual or violent. A report by the University of California, Los Angeles last year estimated that overdoses were a leading cause of death of unhoused people during the pandemic. Data analyses have revealed other disturbing trends: one UCLA study estimated that at least 269,000 students from kindergarten to grade 12 in the state were experiencing homelessness before the pandemic; in LA county, Black residents were four times as likely to be unhoused; and also in LA, there was a 20% jump in the number of unhoused seniors, with nearly 5,000 elderly people living outside before Covid arrived. “It’s just not acceptable,” said Wendy Carrillo, a state assemblymember who represents parts of LA and chairs a budget committee on homelessness. As a kid, she would pass by Skid Row and struggle to understand why so many people were forced to live outside, she said. The crisis has grown since: “We’ve become so disconnected as a society, so cold to the issue that people are OK with stepping over someone who is passed out on the floor.” California’s catastrophe stems in part from a longstanding, statewide housing affordability crisis. Californians spend significantly more of their income on housing compared to the rest of the nation. More than 1.5m renters spend half of their earnings on rent, leaving them potentially one medical emergency or crisis away from homelessness. In recent years, income inequality has only worsened. UCLA research on the residents of one LA encampment found that people cited a range of factors that led them to become unhoused, including eviction, job loss, domestic violence, former incarceration, family conflict and low wages in gig economy jobs. Responding to the crisis, California is pouring billions of dollars into housing and related services, but the success of new programs meant to expand affordable housing and emergency shelter has been mixed. “One of the challenges of housing policy is that it’s like turning around a giant ship. It’s a slow process,” said Shamus Roller, executive director of the National Housing Law Project. The state has made significant progress in recent years in investing in housing, he noted, but the benefits can sometimes take more than a decade to materialize. There are also systemic and historical problems that housing programs can’t solve, including the loss of social safety nets, the dissolution of redevelopment programs, and a controversial state tax measure passed in 1978 that has created significant obstacles for new homeownership, Roller said. And some regions have invested more in temporary shelter programs than in permanent housing, making it hard for people to transition out of shelters, especially as the housing market worsens and as more people newly become unhoused, advocates said. Emblematic of the challenges is California’s signature homelessness response during the pandemic: Project Roomkey. The program temporarily provided motel rooms to an estimated 50,000 people living on the streets. But the program was administered at the local level and some counties fell short of their goals or failed to meet the demand in their regions; participants reported struggling to find housing after hotel stays ended and some returned to the streets because of the strict rules in the program, advocates said. This year, the California governor Gavin Newsom is pushing a $14bn investment in homelessness solutions, meant to create 55,000 new housing units and treatment slots. His Homekey initiative, the successor to Project Roomkey, allows local governments to buy motels to use as temporary or permanent housing for unhoused people. As of last week, the state has awarded $695m for more than 2,400 units. While the programs could be transformative for some participants, advocates worry their impact for many could come too late, especially with statewide eviction protections expiring at the end of the month and pandemic-era rent relief efforts winding down. Even with a partial eviction moratorium in place, sheriffs enforced lockouts of thousands of households in the first year of the pandemic, according to a CalMatters analysis. “We are getting a lot of calls from tenants who are being evicted,” said Jovana Morales-Tilgren, housing policy coordinator with Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability, a Central Valley-based organization. “A lot of undocumented folks don’t have the resources to battle an eviction notice … and then there are not enough shelters for the unhoused people.” Meanwhile, advocates warn, conditions for those living on the streets are only getting harder amid increasing restrictions on camping. A proposed state law would also allow courts to force some people with severe mental illness into treatment. The crackdown on tent living and fear of possible forced treatment can lead people to scatter into more hidden locations where it can be harder for them to access services and get into programs, advocates say. “Using law enforcement to respond to houselessness is both counterproductive and ineffective,” said Eve Garrow, policy analyst and advocate at the ACLU of Southern California. The expansion of criminalization was overwhelming, Garrow said. “And people are experiencing compassion fatigue, and they want something done. Local public officials are responding with what they see as ‘quick fixes’ that aren’t fixes at all and are completely misguided.” People living on the streets or in temporary shelters waiting for housing said they were worried and exhausted by the increasingly hostile rhetoric of politicians and communities. “Unhoused people are blamed for every social ill,” said Henderson, who regularly talks to unhoused residents on his podcast. “There’s an uptick in burglaries, and then the response is, ‘Can we get the unhoused removed?’ Every unhoused person has those stories – as soon as something happens, here comes the police looking at them as the prime suspect.” Kenneth Stallworth, who has been living in a group shelter since his Venice Beach encampment was shut down in a high-profile dispute last year, said he didn’t mind the shelter and appreciated the electricity, but also noted that he had seen several people die or have health emergencies in the facility. “The people are getting what they want,” he said of his fellow Angelenos. “The homeless are getting moved away from areas where there were the most complaints.” Dawn Toftee, 57, was living at an encampment near the stadium where the Super Bowl was held in LA last month, until she was forced to leave in advance of the big game. Officials said the residents were offered housing, but a month later, Toftee is camping down the street – and is still waiting for a housing voucher that could subsidize a rental. “I’m getting old and I don’t want to die on the streets,” she said, adding that she didn’t think officials cared whether people like her got housing: “They just want us out of eyesight.”",News/US news,‘We have failed’: how California’s homelessness catastrophe is worsening,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/22/california-homelessness-crisis-unhoused-and-unequal
3/22/2022,"Zac Goldsmith faces fresh questions about his involvement in a multimillion-pound tax evasion scheme in Spain after a family friend was secretly recorded trying to enlist a police officer to help “resolve” the case. The family friend, businesswoman Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, the ex-lover of Spain’s former King Juan Carlos, was recorded telling the senior police officer the Conservative politician’s career would be “dead” if details of the case became public. The Guardian has obtained a copy of the recording, which was made in April 2015 as Goldsmith campaigned in the general election to retain his seat as an MP. At the time, the police officer, José Manuel Villarejo, was combining his official duties with a now-notorious side business providing covert services to wealthy and powerful private clients in Spain. The covert recording captures Villarejo suggesting to Sayn-Wittgenstein he would be “delighted” to help Zac Goldsmith and his brother, Ben, in their dispute with the tax authorities. A Spanish judge who later reviewed the recording in a separate case unrelated to the Goldsmiths’ legal issues concluded there was no evidence Villarejo undertook any work on behalf of the Goldsmith brothers. Ben Goldsmith said they did not ask Sayn-Wittgenstein to contact Villarejo. However, the secret recording sheds new light on the Spanish tax dispute and is likely to place further pressure on Goldsmith to address the case, which involves land linked to his family’s sprawling Costa del Sol estate, where Boris Johnson and his wife, Carrie, stayed on holiday in October. The Guardian revealed last year that Spanish courts had ruled that property companies owned by Goldsmith and his brother engaged in a €24m tax evasion scheme. Zac Goldsmith, a close ally of Johnson, has repeatedly declined to answer questions about the scheme, which courts have ruled amounted to a deliberate effort to evade tax and a “serious” violation of the law. Documents suggest that by the end of 2021 companies connected to Zac and Ben Goldsmith owed as much as €26m (£21m) to the Spanish state in unpaid taxes and fines. At the time of the recording – which Villarejo secretly made during a visit to Sayn-Wittgenstein’s £3.2m apartment in Belgravia – the tax case was winding its way through Spain’s lower courts, potentially threatening Zac Goldsmith’s political career. Just a few months later, he announced his bid to become London’s mayor. A friend of Sayn-Wittgenstein is believed to have arranged the meeting with Villarejo due to concerns about the safety of her family after the end of her relationship with Juan Carlos. Sipping green tea, Villarejo explained to Sayn-Wittgenstein that alongside his police duties he worked for private clients, boasting he had “a better intelligence service” than the Spanish government. “I have the infrastructure, I have electronic stuff, I have hackers and all that,” he told her. “I have tough people, serious people, and people who don’t exist.” Villarejo agreed to help Sayn-Wittgenstein through his secretive law firm, named Stuart & Mckenzie, telling her there was “zero risk” in using his law firm since its operatives – including “former members of the CIA and FBI” – never knew the identities of his clients. After almost an hour, Sayn-Wittgenstein and the friend, who was also present at the meeting, brought up a different topic: the Goldsmiths. Sayn-Wittgenstein told Villarejo that Ben Goldsmith had visited her two days earlier and was concerned the tax case could harm his brother politically. “What is his worry? His brother, Zac, is a Conservative MP,” Sayn-Wittgenstein told Villarejo. If the newspapers discovered the case, she added: “He’s dead. Company in the Cayman Islands, blah, blah, blah.” Sayn-Wittgenstein’s mention of the Cayman Islands appears to be a reference to the offshore trust structure which, documents suggest, the Goldsmith family used to hold their property interests in Spain. Asked to explain how Villarejo could help, Sayn-Wittgenstein and her associate told Villarejo that Ben Goldsmith was “re-evaluating the situation” in the wake of a recent court ruling that had gone in the Goldsmith brothers’ favour. Explaining that Ben Goldsmith had asked to wait a few days, Sayn-Wittgenstein added: “Then he will come to us to see if we can help him resolve the case.” Villarejo suggested to Sayn-Wittgenstein the brothers should contact his law firm. A source close to Sayn-Wittgenstein, a longstanding friend of Goldsmith family, said: “Ben never came back to Corinna on the issue because he wasn’t interested so that was the end of it.” In a statement, Ben Goldsmith said neither he nor his brother, Zac, contacted Villarejo or his law firm. “We never approached any of the people you mention nor did we ever ask Corinna Sayn-Wittgenstein to do so.” He said he once mentioned the tax case to Sayn-Wittgenstein at a social dinner. “It was only a number of years later that I found out from an article in the Spanish press that Corinna had taken it upon herself, without telling me, to find out more about our case and to see if she could help.” Villarejo is now at the centre of a sweeping corruption scandal in Spain and currently on trial for charges including bribery and influence-peddling. He has denied wrongdoing, but did not respond to requests for comment. His secret recording provides fresh insight into the tax dispute that ensnared the two firms co-owned by the Tory minister and his brother. Sayn-Wittgenstein explained to Villarejo the trouble began when the two brothers “bought some land” from their family. “They’ve done a financial operation to do a development,” she said. On paper, the land was transferred in 2008 – two years before Zac Goldsmith became an MP – from one Goldsmith-owned company to another. Court documents and land registry records suggest the land was segregated from a large area of land that forms part of the Goldsmith family’s sprawling estate in the hills surrounding the mountain village of Benahavís, near Marbella. In 2013, Spain’s tax agency ordered the two Goldsmith-owned companies involved in the property transfer to pay a combined €24m in unpaid taxes, interest and penalties. A Swiss lawyer for one of the companies involved previously denied the case amounted to “tax evasion”. Ben Goldsmith described the Spanish tax agency’s case as absurd and based “on a single and incorrect” valuation of land. Inspectors alleged the companies significantly undervalued the value of the land when it was transferred between them, and failed to properly declare the financial gains arising from the deal by filing inaccurate tax returns The Goldsmith companies appealed, but successive Spanish civil courts have found the deal allowed the companies to evade millions in taxes. Subsequent attempts to appeal at Spain’s supreme court failed in 2019.

3/22/2022,"Las week, 26-year-old Kaylyn Richards received an automated email informing her that she was terminated from her job at an Amazon Fresh grocery retail store in Seattle. Earlier that week, Richards had spoken with one of her managers about clerical problems she was having with the attendance time clock, as she was erroneously docked attendance points, though she noted she had never missed shifts or used paid time off if doing so. A manager reassured her the clerical errors made clocking in and out through the app would be resolved. Later in the week, Richards continued working as usual without any problems, and even noted she discovered glass in a tray of fish after a portion of the glass window in the deli had broken. Then, the day after her last shift, on a Wednesday night, Richards realized she had been locked out of the A to Z Amazon system. “I have not missed any of my shifts here, or I use my PTO to cover it. And to have an app, lock me out of it, and to not even receive any communication from Amazon Fresh is kind of mind-boggling,” Richards said. “To talk to a manager about accruing those points, and have him reassure me that it was already taken care of, then to proceed with my shift and then to be locked out by a robot is kind of crazy.” Richards has argued her firing is in retaliation for her supporting union efforts at her Amazon Fresh store. Her firing has also jeopardized her housing security, as she has been living in a youth home program and needs paystubs to prove steady employment in order to be placed into an apartment. Workers at Richards’ Amazon Fresh grocery store in Seattle with 150 employees, are currently seeking union recognition from Amazon while organizing support among co-workers to form Amazon Workers United. The organizing drive has faced significant opposition from Amazon, which refuses to recognize the union. Several unfair labor practice charges have been filed with the National Labor Relations Board alleging retaliation to union organizing, including claims Richards was fired in retaliation for supporting the union. “Having a body to protect people from abusive management would be very helpful,” said Nova Rune, a trans woman who has worked at Amazon Fresh since October and noted she has been misgendered multiple times at work and management isn’t properly educated on discriminatory issues. Amazon opened the first Amazon Fresh grocery store in 2020 and is currently expanding retail store locations around the country, in addition to operating about 500 Whole Foods stores in the US. There are currently no formally recognized unions representing workers at any of Amazon’s grocery locations, though three Amazon warehouses, one in Alabama and two in New York City, are in the process of holding union elections. Joseph Fink has worked at the Amazon Fresh store in Seattle since before it opened in July. He’s previously worked at Whole Foods and several other grocery stores. He explained forming a union had been a topic of discussion among workers since the store opened, but the efforts became more organized when Amazon was forced to post notices to employees company-wide affirming their union organizing rights as part of a settlement with the National Labor Relations Board at the end of December. “Sometimes there is a disconnect between ideas in a boardroom and on the ground in the trenches,” said Fink. “We don’t have an onsite human resources team. I’ve sent emails, I’ve submitted multiple HR cases and there’s no response.” As an example of bad policies, Fink cited a ban on employees working with water bottles, while they face being reprimanded if they leave in the midst of a task to go to the water fountain in the store. He argued there were many policies where workers are yelled at for minor infractions and the most vulnerable workers were the most susceptible to being disciplined and terminated for policies such as the point-based attendance system or subject to sexual harassment in the workplace without any action from management or corporate. Fink described one manager verbally and sexually harassing multiple employees without reprimand, including making sexually explicit remarks toward Fink in the workplace. Fink also claimed he was verbally reprimanded for posting union flyers in the break room, which were removed. Amazon Workers United first went public several weeks ago and have notified the company of their demands. They include raising the store’s minimum wage to $25 an hour, an employee discount in line with what is offered to Whole Foods employees, an improved dress code, a fairer attendance policy, chairs for cashiers, sexual harassment training, and access to food the store throws away or composts. “There’s a culture of fear about basic interactions with employees. You can be reprimanded and that type of culture of fear has made it hard to have any conversation about a union at all,” added Fink. “I’m not afraid. Jeff [Bezos] doesn’t scare me.” A spokesperson for Amazon denied claims of retaliation in regards to Kaylyn Richards’s termination. “These claims of retaliation are false, and our attendance policy is applied consistently to all employees in our stores. We encourage employees who have questions about the policy to speak with their managers or HR partners,” the spokesperson said in an email. In regards to the union drive, the spokesperson added: “Our employees have the choice of whether or not to join a union, and they haven’t chosen to do that at this store. The opinions of a few individuals do not reflect the majority of our employees. Our focus remains on working directly with our team to make Amazon a great place to work. “The allegations in the charges filed with the NLRB are false and we look forward to showing that through this process.”",News/US news,‘Locked out by a robot’: Amazon Fresh accused of retaliation to union drive,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/22/amazon-fresh-retaliation-union-unionization
3/22/2022,"For nearly 125 years, a wooden grain elevator towered over the town of Elva, visible from miles away and distinguishing the community as an economic hub in the Canadian Prairies. The structure endured frigid cold, beating rains and harsh sun, but after decades of neglect, its owner has announced plans to dismantle the country’s oldest “prairie castle”, closing a chapter in the region’s history. For communities like Elva, the loss of an elevator, once used to store grain from surrounding farms for transport by train, marks the last straw in their decline, said the head of the Manitoba Historical Society. “When you lose the post office, the church and school, maybe you can tolerate those. But the grain elevators were often the reason why many towns existed in the first place,” said Gordon Goldsborough. “To see the elevator go is kind of the that last hurrah for the town.” Typically, wooden grain elevators meet one of two fates: they are either destroyed in a large fire or demolished. But Troy Angus, who bought the dilapidated Elva tower last year in a municipal auction, hopes he’s found a third option. In a video posted to YouTube, Angus details how his company plans to carefully dismantle the structure, with the hope of reclaiming an estimated 15,000 board-feet of wood beams, old metal scales, door hinges and thousands of pounds of nails. Angus also bought a second elevator nearby, which he plans to also dismantle. “There’s no way these buildings are going to be demolished, nor are they going to be restored to their former glory,” he says in the video. Decades of neglect and a lack of “simple preventative maintenance” mean the elevator cannot be saved. Built in 1897, the Lake of the Woods Milling Company grain elevator has large holes in the tin roof, which allowed moisture to build up, warping and rotting the wood. Goldsborough agreed that Angus’s initiative is the “best possible outcome” for the ailing structure. “Most elevators are just tipped over crushed into pieces and hauled to the landfill and forgotten, he said. “The pieces of this one are going to survive. And the story it represents will be remembered, because there are tangible pieces of it left.” In the last year, nine elevators were destroyed in Manitoba, a trend mirrored throughout the Prairie region. Preserving the structures is difficult, and the scale of farming has shifted dramatically in recent generations: the elevator in Elva has capacity for 25,000 bushels, but the largest steel elevator in the province can hold 1.5 million bushels. “The newer steel ones are less expensive to maintain, and so there’s really no advantages of these old elevators, other than nostalgia,” said Goldsborough. Manitoba once had more than 700 wood elevators, but only an estimated 124 remain, half of which are still in use. Goldsborough suspects a handful of the elevators will remain in the future, including a row of five in the town of Inglis that have been preserved. Once the elevator in Elva comes down, the country’s oldest elevator will be in museum outside the Manitoba town of Austin. “We’re watching a transformation of the landscape in real time,” he said. “They’re just so symbolic of western Canada. Nothing on the landscape came close to that grand scale. There’s really nothing like those elevators.”",News/World news,End of an era as Canada’s oldest ‘prairie castle’ to be dismantled,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/canada-prairie-castle-elva-manitoba-grain-elevator
3/22/2022,"Chesney Hawkes, the one and only, is sitting on my sofa with a mug of lemon and ginger tea and recalling some encounters with fans. “I was told that, this one guy, The One and Only was his favourite song, and whenever it would come on in the pub, his friends would pick him up and he’d be like …” He makes disco fingers at the ceiling. “Then he sadly passed away, but they played it at the funeral, and when it came on, that’s when they raised the coffin.” We are silent for a moment, picturing the scene. Gosh, I say. “I know, right? Real lump-in-the throat time. That’s when I realised that, this song, I don’t have ownership of it. It went out there and made an emotional connection with people and that has nothing to do with me,” he says, then sips his tea. Before Hawkes arrives, I worry that I will struggle to see him as the 50-year-old father of three he is, rather than the teenage heart-throb who sang one of the catchiest No 1 singles of all time. Fortunately, he makes it easy for me, because he turns up with his son Casey, who, at 20, is older than his father was in his pop heyday. They have an appointment to renew Casey’s passport later this afternoon – and you can’t really swoon over a man on his way to the Passport Office, even if he once was the biggest pop star in the world. We are meeting at mine because it is in between the passport place and where the Hawkeses are staying on this trip. Hawkes’ wife, Kristina, is American and the family live in Los Angeles, but the UK is where Hawkes was born and where he works. “A typical day here might be: get up, do a couple interviews; there might be a rehearsal with the band, possibly a gig. I just did Butlin’s up in Skegness,” he says, with that sweet smile that hasn’t dimmed in the past three decades. He is so sunny, as open as a flower, that it is hard to believe he has ever heard a harsh word in his life, let alone been an object of derision for years, his name a byword for shallow pop and short‑lived success. Many one-hit wonders coast in on brief novelty – Baby Got Back by Sir Mix-a-Lot, say, or Mr Blobby – so the ones that endure, that people still dance to in their kitchens decades later, are an elite, eclectic bunch. There is the Knack’s My Sharona, of course, plus 99 Red Balloons by Nena, Tiffany’s I Think We’re Alone Now and Steal My Sunshine by Len. And then there is Hawkes’ The One and Only, still sounding as sweetly endearing as it did in 1991. During lockdown, Hawkes and his children cheered up the country by singing it on This Morning. For Hawkes, there is a vindication of sorts in this, not to mention some employment, and it has been a long time coming. I was 12 when The One and Only was released, only seven years younger than Hawkes. My friends and I read every interview with “Chezza” in Smash Hits, so we knew all about him: that his dad was in some 60s band, which didn’t interest us at all, and that his younger brother, Jodie, was his drummer, which interested us a lot. We knew that he – alongside some old guy called Roger Daltrey – was the star of the movie Buddy’s Song, in which he sang The One and Only, and some of us even went to see it. We followed the exciting rumours about the mole above his right lip – or was it his left? – and whether it was fake. Most of all, we sang the song, belting it out in the schoolyard every breaktime. I noticed that his follow-up singles (I’m a Man Not a Boy and Secrets of the Heart – and no, I didn’t need to Google the titles, thanks very much) didn’t sell as well, after which he disappeared, but I wasn’t concerned. After all, he had been No 1 in the UK for five weeks. Surely he was just living off his riches somewhere. What happens to one-hit wonders when the hit has gone? Their names are too recognisable for them to get a normal job, but they can’t live without one. Hawkes was in the extra-unfortunate position of not having written The One and Only – Nik Kershaw did – meaning that he didn’t make as much from the song as I had assumed. The money he did get he spent exactly how a nice but naive 19-year-old would: “I bought cars for everyone in my family; I bought the stupid little red sports car. And my parents were not so good with money, either, so they didn’t have advice for me,” he says. Nor did his record company offer any guidance. Two years after The One and Only, with his subsequent singles – which he wrote – and album failing to live up to expectations, it dropped him. “It was like losing a family: the record company girls who feel like sisters, because they travel around with you a lot; the people involved in the promotions. I was 18 when I met them all, so I was really taken aback when I suddenly couldn’t get any of these people on the phone. It was a big learning curve for me when I realised: ‘Oh, OK, none of that was real and I’m a washed-up pop star at 23,’” he says. With friends, he formed bands “and gave them names like Ebb and Fly. We thought we were Radiohead, basically.” In the space of three years, he went from palling around with Take That to flat-sharing in Barnes, west London. In the 90s, the press took it for granted that Hawkes was just another boring pretty boy, but his background is fascinating. His father, Len “Chip” Hawkes, was the singer in the beat group the Tremeloes, so Hawkes and his siblings grew up in a house often filled with 60s rock’n’rollers. Gerry Marsden from Gerry and the Pacemakers, Herman’s Hermits, Marmalade, the Searchers and Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich were regular guests. “My parents were like rock’n’roll hippies, with my mum always in really short skirts; my dad still has long hair. They would throw parties all the time and when we’d get up for school, we’d have to step over one or two musicians to get to our cornflakes,” he says. On top of that, his parents were – improbably – born-again Baptists. “They pulled us kids into it,” he says. They sent them to Christian camps, where the leaders would say angels had visited the night before. Some of the kids talked in tongues. “It was the worst,” says Hawkes. Somehow, despite this double whammy of rock excess and religious nuttiness, Hawkes remained a gentle, level-headed kid who just wanted to make music. But that dream went sour when he was barely in his 20s. “Piers Morgan and [the entertainment journalist] Rick Sky – you know those guys? They picked on me a lot. It was a daily thing. At the time I was like: ‘I’m fine, I’m fine,’ but I was still really young then and you realise later that stuff went in,” he says. Hawkes tried to block out the noise by sticking with his brother and the friends he had had since childhood. But how did he not lose the plot? “I think it was Jodie, to be honest with you. He has been a huge, huge crutch for me. He went through it all with me and he’s a very stable guy, so he really helped me. And my dad, bless him, as scatty and crazy as he can be. There’s a lot of love in my family,” he says. Another stabilising force entered his life in 1995, when he happened to go to a pub in Barnes, to see a mate play a gig, and two American models walked in. “It was crazy that they were there and not, say, in the West End, but I walked up to one and asked if I could buy her a drink and she said: ‘I’ll have a pint of lager, please.’ I was like: ‘Oh my God! Will you marry me?’” She did – a little later – and he and Kristina have been together ever since. “She had no idea who I was when we met and she keeps me on a level emotionally. Also financially, because, when we met, I was very much in a hole. Then she came along. Her father was a banker and she is very, very good with money. So she was like: ‘OK, let’s restructure you here.’” The family moved to LA 10 years ago, mainly for adventure, but also with the idea that Hawkes could write music for other artists. “But the business is tough and it was the wrong timing for me. Nowadays, it’s no good just to get a song on an album, because there’s no money in songs. You need a single, unless you’re with Adele or Ed Sheeran,” he says. Instead, Hawkes has found an unexpected career on what he describes as the “heritage circuit”. The other week, he did a gig in Manchester alongside the Vengaboys and “that band that sang Cotton Eye Joe” (Rednex). Other bands and singers he shares a bill with frequently include Katrina and the Waves (“always look forward to seeing them”), Jason Donovan (“a mate”), Tiffany (“so lovely”) and Carol Decker from T’Pau (“love Carol Decker.”) I tell him I had a taste of the heritage circuit when I took my kids to Camp Bestival a few years back and Rick Astley was headlining. “Rick’s had an amazing career, with the Rickroll thing,” he says with enthusiasm, referring to the online prank whereby clicking an unrelated link takes the browser to the video for Astley’s 1987 hit Never Gonna Give You Up. It is slightly more than 30 years since The One and Only. To mark the occasion, Hawkes is putting out a five-CD box set, The Complete Picture, featuring all the songs he has written over the years. He is hoping that it will wake people up to the fact that he is more than just that song. Did he ever consider leaving music behind? “I can’t – it’s like breathing to me. I can’t even walk past a guitar without picking it up. I’m not bitter about what happened, but I do sometimes have a pang and think: what if my career had carried on a little longer? What if I’d released different singles? You overthink things, don’t you? But, in general, I’m very happy with where I am. I’m very much in love with my wife; my kids are amazing. It’s a steady, day-to-day kind of happiness.” Things have not been easy for the Hawkes family recently. His father was diagnosed with cancer a decade ago. Eight years ago, his father and another of the Tremeloes, Richard Westwood. were accused of indecently assaulting a minor in 1968. After two years, a judge ordered the pair be found not guilty. Hawkes thought he had already experienced all the downsides to fame, but this was a new low. “It was a terrible time, with people turning up to the house. But my dad is made of stronger stuff than most,” he says. When his dad has been feeling unwell due to the cancer, Hawkes has subbed for him at Tremeloes gigs – a kind of double-heritage gig. Sure, he would like it if people wanted to hear new things from him, but that is fun, too. It is time for Hawkes and Casey to catch the train if they are going to make their appointment. I walk with them towards the station and we talk about his gigging schedule. I also ask if his mole was real. He manages not to roll his eyes and says yes, but sometimes picture editors would flip his photos around, so it looked as if it moved. It has faded a bit, but when he points to it I can see it, under the stubble. I always knew it was real. His daughter calls to ask how our interview went. He grins and says he will call her back in a bit, because he is still with me. They tell each other they love each another. You really landed on your feet, I say; things could have gone a very different way. “Oh God, yeah – believe me, I know. And it wouldn’t have been good. I feel very, very lucky,” he says – and I believe him. I wave him goodbye and watch him as he goes. And just as he always tried, he walks with dignity and pride.

3/22/2022,"For three weeks, the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol has been under siege by Russian forces. Between 100,000 and 200,000 people remain trapped in the city, which continues to come under relentless bombardment. Local authorities say 80% of the city’s infrastructure has been destroyed, some of it beyond repair. The city has been without water, electricity and heating, and it is impossible to count the number of deaths. This week Ukraine rejected Russia’s ultimatum to surrender Mariupol. The fall of Mariupol would be an economic blow to Ukraine and a symbolic victory for Russia. “Mariupol has a practical and symbolic significance for Russia,” Andrii Ianitskyi, the head of the centre for excellence in economic journalism at Kyiv School of Economics, told the Guardian. “It is a large port city and a base for Ukrainian armed forces. So if Russians want to have a land corridor [from the Donbas] to Crimea, they need to control the city.” Since 2014, less than 30km has separated Mariupol from the Russian-controlled separatist territories in the Donbas. Mariupol is a metallurgical centre for iron and steelworks, heavy machinery manufacturing, and ship repairs. Ukraine’s largest steel plants owned by the country’s leading metallurgical group, Metinvest, are located in Mariupol. One of them, Azovstal, was badly damaged by Russian shelling this week. Ianitskyi said the Russian army had been targeting not only civilian infrastructure but also the economic infrastructure, with the aim of incurring as much damage as possible. Mariupol is also home to the largest trading port in the Azov Sea from which Ukraine exports grain, iron and steel, and heavy machinery. In 2021, the main destinations for Ukrainian exports from Mariupol port were European and Middle Eastern countries such as Italy, Lebanon, and Turkey. The port had suffered after the start of the Donbas war, having lost transit cargo traffic from former markets, including Russia. After the annexation of Crimea, Russia built a bridge connecting the peninsula to its mainland and unilaterally imposed restrictions for ships passing the Kerch Strait. There was also a symbolic significance, Ianitskyi said. In 2014, Mariupol, the second-largest city in the Donetsk region, withstood brief occupation by pro-Russian forces. After Ukraine lost control over the regional capital of Donetsk, Mariupol hosted the largest number of internally displaced people from the occupied parts of the Donbas, more than 96,000 people as of 2019. Not only does Mariupol lie in the territory that is claimed by the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic, an area recognised by Russia before the full-scale invasion, but it is also part of Vladimir Putin’s vision of “Novorossiya” – a territory stretching across eastern and southern Ukraine along the Black Sea coastline that is viewed by Putin as “historically Russian lands”. Capturing Mariupol would also be a huge win for Kremlin propaganda, which portrays Ukraine as governed by Nazis and the war as “de-Nazification”. The city has been a base of the Azov battalion, a former paramilitary unit with roots in far-right and neo-Nazi groups. Although they form the tiniest fraction of Ukraine’s national guard, Russian propaganda has claimed Azov fighters were responsible for killings of civilians and destruction in Mariupol.",News/World news,Why is Mariupol so important to Russian forces?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/mariupol-important-russian-forces-moscow-port-city
3/22/2022,"P&O Ferries could face prosecution over the sacking of 800 workers, business minister Paul Scully warned ahead of a government ultimatum to the company. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has said he will review all government contracts and dealings with the company and its owners, DP World. On Tuesday, the RMT union said seafarers from abroad had been brought in to replace the 800 sacked British crew and were being paid as little as £1.80 an hour. P&O Ferries disputes the figures, but it declined to discuss the rates or give alternative rates and would not confirm whether it paid the minimum wage. Scully said the government was examining whether the company had followed the proper procedure ahead of mass redundancies. Shapps has given the company a deadline of Tuesday night to explain how the procedures were followed. “If they have flouted the notification law where they are supposed to tell the secretary of state when they are going to make more than a hundred people redundant, then there are criminal sanctions involved in that, including an unlimited fine,” he said. “We have reserved the right to approach the prosecuting authorities should that be the right thing to do.” Scully said the company should be on notice that it had fundamentally changed the relationship with the government, including a £25m subsidy the company had received to help develop London Gateway as a freeport. “They need to realise that the relationship between the companies and the government has changed as a result of their absolutely callous [conduct],” he said. Shapps admitted last week that he was made aware of planned redundancies on Wednesday evening at 8.30pm but assumed that they would be conducted in the same way as the 1,100 layoffs in 2020, through consultation, rather than “the cynical approach” used. The shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said the government “should have moved” faster after it was notified, telling BBC Breakfast: “I want to know what sort of questions was the government asking? “It was clear when that memo was sent to the government this was something out of the ordinary … to be told yesterday that they did know in advance what was going on, first of all, they should have moved to stop that and they can still move to stop that. It’s no good saying it will help people get jobs who’ve been sacked in this way. “We cannot allow this to stand because this becomes the template for how these things are done in the UK from now on.” The former pensions minister Ros Altmann said the company’s behaviour was “absolutely disgraceful”, and added “the government should think very carefully about forcing the employer to behave better and if that means that they have to impose any kind of sanctions or warnings to them, I think that would be entirely appropriate.” Lady Altmann told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme there could be “further concerns” about the company’s multi-employer pension fund with about 100 companies linked to it. “There’s clearly a bigger risk now, in some ways that the company won’t necessarily survive,” she said. “It has a very wealthy parent who normally one might be looking to to fix this deficit, even if the business itself isn’t going so well for the subsidiary, the parent company is doing extremely well. If we don’t try to ensure that money is paid in now, then the bill for other companies, competitors of P&O may be even greater. “If that business moves forward, then it will be having some unfair advantages over its competition if they are paying proper minimum wage and abiding by the types of laws that British companies need to abide by – but also there might be extra costs for their pension.”",News/Business,"P&O Ferries could face prosecution over sackings, minister says",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/22/po-ferries-could-face-prosecution-over-sackings-minister-says
3/22/2022,"Climate activists have reacted with concern to reports that Shell is reconsidering its decision to abandon development of the Cambo oilfield, warning that such a reversal would further threaten emissions reductions targets. The fossil fuel producer could U-turn on a decision to pull out of the North Sea project because the “economic, political and regulatory environment had changed enormously since the decision was announced just three months ago”, according to sources cited by the BBC. The Brent crude oil price was below $70 (£53) a barrel in December when Shell announced the long-expected decision on Cambo, but since then prices have surged – reaching $116 on Tuesday morning – in part because of concerns Russian supplies could be disrupted or blocked because of its invasion of Ukraine. The price rise has prompted analysts across the fossil fuel industry to re-examine the economics of projects. Shell is thought to still have its own analysts assigned to the Cambo project, in which it still owns an interest. However, it is understood that Shell has not formally reconsidered investment in Cambo at its most senior levels, a step that would almost certainly be required given the project’s political sensitivity. Governments around the world are scrambling to wean themselves off Russian oil and gas in response to the invasion, and Boris Johnson has said the UK should increase its own domestic fossil fuel output, including in the North Sea. Mark van Baal, the leader of the campaign group Follow This said a decision to develop Cambo would contravene guidance by the International Energy Agency, a respected global body. Last year the IEA said the exploration and development of new oil and gas must stop immediately if the world is to have any chance of limiting global heating to 1.5C, the target set at the 2015 UN climate talks in Paris. Shell has itself pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050, but has not outlined detailed steps of how it will reduce its fossil fuel output. “Any new fields will be stranded if we are to meet the Paris climate targets,” van Baal said, adding that Shell’s pledge to reach net zero by 2050 would be “really empty without action this decade”. “We know this is a response to the Ukraine war,” he said. “The only good response to the Ukraine war is to replace Russian fossil fuels with renewables.” Follow This has gained the support of a significant minority of large investors for its campaign encouraging shareholders to vote for climate strategies at Shell and other large fossil fuel producers. The group is again putting forward a resolution for Shell’s annual shareholder meeting calling for it to align with the Paris agreement, along with other big oil companies such as its UK rival BP and its US counterparts ExxonMobil and Chevron. Philip Evans, the oil and gas transition campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: “The type of oil that can be extracted from Cambo is not usable in the UK, so this project will do nothing to tackle high bills or shore up energy security.” Evans suggested “Shell wasn’t interested in pursuing this project when it was a bad look for them”, but if they were to restart Cambo now they would “stand to gain billions in the midst of wartime price hikes”. Shell has argued that it has reached its targets so far in its plan to hit net zero emissions, but said it should not move faster than society at large in cutting oil use. It has also pointed to its investments in low-emission technologies such as public electric car chargers and hydrogen production.

3/22/2022,"Back in 1967, when Judith Joy Ross was a shy and awkward 20-year-old, still figuring out how to be a photographer, she used to take what she calls “sneaking pictures” of people on the street. “I had various little techniques,” she tells me. “Often I’d pretend to be working out how to use the camera, while I was actually shooting.” How, I ask, did she conquer her self-consciousness and approach the myriad passing strangers, whose portraits now amount to one of the most singular and affecting bodies of work in American photography? “You pick a subject and you make yourself do it,” she replies. “That was hard for me. It was like, how much torture can I take? But, what I would see in a person, if only for a moment, was so wonderful, it was worth it.” A conversation with Ross, who is now in her mid-70s, is an unpredictable ride. She is wise, hilariously funny and forthright – about herself and others. Oh, and she swears. A lot. “As a photographer, you’re not supposed to be attached to your subjects,” she says at one point, “but I’m so fucking attached. I’m even attached to things that other people consider garbage. Basically, I just love things I’ve known for a long time.” In a new retrospective book, Judith Joy Ross: Photographs 1978-2015, the things she loves – trees, rooms, windows, all rendered hauntingly beautiful – are outnumbered by the ordinary people she has met and made somehow extraordinary in her deftly composed, quietly revealing portraits. Alongside a retrospective exhibition of her work that has just opened at Le Bal in Paris, the book makes plain what many of her fellow photographers have been saying for years: that Judith Joy Ross may well be America’s greatest living portraitist. The American documentary photographer, Gregory Halpern, recently called her “the greatest portrait photographer to have ever worked in the medium”. Alys Tomlinson, an acclaimed young British photographer, who acknowledges her as an influence, says: “I don’t understand why she isn’t more well known. Maybe it’s because she is drawn to people that you might well pass on the street and not notice. She elevates them with her camera. Her portraits are not neutral. There is an empathy on her side. A deep connection. She makes you look closely at her subjects, and think about them.” Interestingly Ross tells me that she seldom photographs rich people and “only sometimes” poor people. “I’m looking,” she says, “for people like me.” For most of her working life, Ross has used an eight-by-10-inch plate camera mounted on a tripod, which, she says, “is so big and fucking beautiful, it disarms people. It’s like the circus has come to town! They feel special – most of the time, anyway.” Her portraits often exude an almost luminous quietude, their presence deepened by the blurred shadows and indistinct shapes in the background. It is as if everything extraneous falls away the moment she presses the shutter. When I suggest she has a signature style that many aspire to, but few attain, she says only half-jokingly: “All my pictures certainly look alike, which is kind of creepy to me. I was not seeking a style, though. The world can’t be defined.” Ross grew up in Hazleton, a small coal mining city in Pennsylvania, where her father had a five-and-dime store and her mother taught piano. For an early series, Eurana Park (1982), she revisited an outdoor swimming pool in nearby Weatherly, which she frequented as a child. The portraits brilliantly evoke the languor of those long summers as well as the awkwardness of adolescence. In one, a young boy with a pudding bowl haircut stands stiffly holding a garden rake. In another, a teenage girl stares into the lens, her gaze so resolute that it takes a while to notice that her hair is wet and flattened from a swim, her forehead still dappled with tiny droplets of water. The details speak volumes about Ross’s concentrated gaze. “For me, making a photograph is tactile,” she says. “It’s sensual. I find the beauty that lies in the ordinary circumstances of the everyday. I don’t transform that ordinariness, though. I record it.” The Eurana Park portraits were made in the shadow of her father’s death. “It was a very difficult time,” she says. “As a child, we’d go there on special days and it was like Brigadoon for me. Children playing, frogs, huge hemlock trees. When I went back there to photograph, I was mourning my father. He’s in the work somehow.” One senses that her teenage years were not altogether happy. She singles out one image: a group portrait in which three girls gaze at a young couple perched on a nearby car. “The girl chewing her fingernails, that was me,” she tells me, matter of factly. “The social loser type person, who gets to observe, not be.” When I ask if she was adrift as a teenager, she says: “I’m still adrift. Back then, I would have said I was fucked up. For most people sexuality is a cool thing, but not for me.” Her otherness had been intensified in the late 1960s, when she took a photography course at the Institute of Design in Chicago. Her tutor was the photographer Aaron Siskind, an iconoclast who elevated formal experimentation and abstraction over intuitive skill and craft. “I was a pretty lost person at grad school,” she says, “It stunk! Siskind would sit 30 feet away and look at prints and say things like, ‘This one has a quality.’ I didn’t know what the fuck that meant.” She spent most afternoons in the local cinema downtown. “I was not a healthy person,” she says. “I graduated because they could not have dealt with me for another year.” In 1983, still grieving for her father, she travelled to Washington and began working on what would become her most celebrated series, Portraits at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Almost 40 years on, its quiet observational resonance remains undimmed, each portrait an acute glimpse of private contemplation. The wall itself, inscribed with the names of American dead, is an almost subliminal presence throughout. Instead, it is the faces that convey the weight of each individual’s private thoughts and, by extension, the inchoate grief of a divided nation. “It was all motivation,” she says now, of the impulse that led her there. “The war was on TV every morning, when you were eating your Cheerios and milk. It was upsetting and it still is. I was young and I thought I was going to end the war with my photographs, as inappropriate as it was to go to the Vietnam memorial with a viewfinder and ask people if I could photograph them. I also had this crazy idea to do a requiem mass through my pictures. I mean, what the fuck was that about? I didn’t know shit about music.” When the influential American curator, John Szarkowski saw the portraits, he choose 16 of them to include in a show called New Photography at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1985. Having been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, Ross had already embarked on what, in retrospect, is her least characteristic work, Portraits of the United States Congress. These were anything but ordinary people and she later said that, while photographing them in their work environment at the Capitol, she felt “intimidated over and over”. The results are surprisingly intimate, the expressions ranging from stoical to vulnerable. “I love the way reality looks in the most ordinary terms,” she says, “Even in the Congress, there are goofy things.” The new book is a catalogue of ordinariness elevated, whether the hauntingly mysterious interiors of her family’s summer home in Rockport or the troubled faces of people staring from a vantage point at Eagle Rock, New Jersey towards the altered Manhattan skyline a week after 9/11. Her house near Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, has a darkroom in the basement where she meticulously develops her prints, which are always roughly the same size as her 8”x10” negatives. She avoids the starkness of black and white by toning her prints in gold chloride, a painstaking process that, depending on the subject, lends them a grey or brown aspect. “I began doing that with the Eurana Park pictures,” she elaborates. “Some, like the three little girls with popsicles, are printed brown because they are full of joy. Others, mainly of the older kids, are printed grey because I could sense they already had the basic existential issues that adults have. That series has an awareness that life is going to be hard. Period. For me, the greyness is our mortality. I would not have said that back then, but I found myself saying it to myself yesterday when I was thinking about the pictures.” At present, Ross is suffering from an eye problem following pre-pandemic surgery that has left her with double vision. “I can photograph,” she say, “but it’s hard to take a walk.” One senses that photography gave her a way to be in the world. “I’m just interested in people, but I don’t want to get too close to them,” she says. “I keep them at arm’s length with the camera. It’s like a magic charm. It’s such an intense pleasure to photograph strangers because, in that moment, you can see them in such an intimate way. It’s kind of crazy, but I love some of those people even though I have never seen them again.”",Arts/Art and design,‘My subjects feel special – most of the time’: Judith Joy Ross on her sensual portraits,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/22/my-subjects-feel-special-most-of-the-time-judith-joy-ross-on-her-sensual-portraits
