5/12/2022,"There’s really no use denying the headwinds that are pushing the markets around these days. Persistently high inflation, slowing GDP growth, and a jobs market that, while expanding in absolute terms, is still down from pre-pandemic levels are feeding fears that we’re facing a round of ‘70’s-style stagflation. And these have combined with geopolitical factors – the Russia-Ukraine war, the resumption of severe lockdown policies in China – to ratchet up worries about recession in the near term. At the same time, there are reasons for hope. Oppenheimer’s chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus points those out, starting with the 1Q22 earnings release season. Stoltzfus reminds us that, as of last week, 87% of the S&P-listed firms have releases their Q1 data, and that 77% of them have surprised to the upside. Overall, earnings are up nearly 8% year-over-year, and revenues are up 14.2%. Looking ahead, Stoltzfus paints a picture for investors willing to look at the bright side of life. He writes of the path forward, “Over the course of this quarter we’d expect economic data and corporate news to persist in providing enough positive offsets to negative news as efforts by the Federal Reserve, the business community and the consumer to navigate the challenges at hand succeed in climbing the current proverbial wall of worry.” Navigating the challenges ahead is the chief task for every investor, from the smallest retail trader to the largest hedge fund manager. And to give a head start on that task, Oppenheimer’s equity analysts have picked out two stocks that may have bottomed out after losing heavily in the first part of the year. We’ve taken the details on both from the TipRanks database, and we’ll present it now, with commentary from some of Oppenheimer’s best stock pros. RingCentral (RNG) We’re starting with RingCentral, a communications-as-a-service software company specializing in bringing business communications solutions to the modern office. The company’s products include phone lines and extensions, video calling, screen sharing, and call forwarding, all offered through the cloud and compatible with Google Docs, Outlook, and Salesforce. RingCentral’s computerized telecom can accessed through desktop systems and mobile devices. As can be imagined, RingCentral’s business saw gains during the corona crisis. With work-from-home expanding, business communications were at a premium – and that’s reflected in RingCentral’s top line, which has grown sequentially every quarter for over two years now. In the most recent quarter reported, 1Q22, the company’s financial results beat the high-end guidance on all key metrics. Revenue was up 33% year-over-year to reach $468 million, driven by a 35% y/y increase in subscription revenue, which made up $440 million of the total. The company’s annualized recurring revenue came to $1.9 billion, also up 35% y/y. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS grew from 27 cents in the year-ago quarter to 39 cents in the current period. The company finished Q1 with $302 million in cash and liquid assets available, up 11.5% from the $267 million on hand at the end of 1Q21. Despite the solid earnings report, RNG shares are down 75% over the past year. Even though RingCentral has a sound business model, the company is facing increased competition from major market names like Microsoft and Cisco, and from niche competitors like Zoom. In addition, RingCentral has seen some churn in upper management recently, and earlier this week announced a new CFO, Sonalee Parekh, and a new President and COO, Mo Katibeh. Even with these pressures on the company, Oppenheimer’s 5-star analyst Timothy Horan writes of RNG: “The most important takeaways for the quarter is that its high quality service and features are enabling stable pricing/ARPU across the board, it is growing Teams uses very well at 500% YOY, it has 500K partner seats, and this growth is accelerating, while the company emphasizes a renewed focus on profitability.” At the bottom line, Horan says, “RingCentral should be a beneficiary of our very optimistic outlook on the overall cloud communications sector, which we predict (in a 50-page white paper) will grow fourfold to $100B within six years... The company has the highest quality service in the industry with the best go to market strategy as it has many of the incumbent PBX providers and telcos as partners.” Based on all of the above, Horan upgraded RNG from Perform (i.e. Neutral) to Outperform (i.e. Buy) and introduced a price target of $100. This would reflect gains of ~45% should the stock ultimately reach this target. (To watch Horan’s track record, click here) If there’s one certainty in the markets, it’s that tech firms like RingCentral will get plenty of attention from the analysts. RNG shares have 24 recent reviews, breaking down 22 to 2 in favor of Buys over Holds to back the Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $68.49 and its $142.57 average price target implies ~100% upside from that level. (See RNG stock forecast on TipRanks) SVB Financial Group (SIVB) And now we’ll turn to the California-based Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB Financial Group. This is a commercial bank focused on high-tech venture capital, and has provided funding for over 30,000 startups in the last 40 years. As of the end of 1Q22, SVB boasts $397 billion in total client funds, $220 billion in bank assets, and $69 billion in total loans. In April, SVB released its 1Q22 results, and beat the forecasts on both revenues and earnings. The top line, at $1.61 billion, came in 12% above estimates, and was up 14% year-over-year. At the bottom line, the diluted EPS of $7.92, while down from $10.03 in the year-ago quarter, beat the forecast of $5.60 by an impressive 41%. Even though this bank has been reporting strong profits and beating the analyst forecasts, the shares are down 38% from the peak they hit in November of last year. It’s important to note that SVB has a high exposure to the tech sector, and that high tech stocks generally have come under heavy pressure over the past 6 months. Despite the banks current share price weakness, Chris Kotowski, another of Oppenheimer’s 5-star analysts, believes ""investors should take advantage of this weakness."" and he upgrades SIVB from Perform (i.e. Neutral) to Outperform (i.e. Buy). Kotowski also sets a $702 price target on this stock, suggesting a 50% upside potential. (To watch Kotowski’s track record, click here) Backing his bullish stance, Kotowski writes: “Following recently announced 1Q22 results, we raised our 2023 EPS estimate from $38.94 to $46.75. In addition to the strong underlying growth, SIVB is very asset sensitive and should benefit significantly from rising rates as its business model generates a lot of demand deposits. Depending on what timeframe one looks at, SIVB has historically traded between a 90% and 117% relative P/E to the market, and our price target is based on a 90% relative P/E.” Silicon Valley denizens can usually count on plenty of attention from the Street, and this bank is no exception. There are 19 recent analyst reviews here, including 16 to Buy and 3 to Hold for a Strong Buy consensus view. The average price target of $721.76 is slightly more bullish than the Oppenheimer view, and implies ~54% upside from the current share price of $469.03.

5/12/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- The rout in stocks isn’t over just yet, according to Morgan Stanley strategists, who see scope for both US and European equities to correct further amid mounting concerns of slowing growth. Most Read from Bloomberg Don’t Bother Paying Off Student Loan Debt Right Now, Advisers Say TerraUSD Stablecoin Plunges as Crypto Market Awaits Rescue Prices in US Outstrip Forecasts in Sign of Inflation Persisting Nike Escalates Feud with StockX, Says Site is Selling Fake Shoes Value Stocks Power Gains While Tech Lags Behind: Markets Wrap Strategist Michael Wilson, who has long been a skeptic of the decade-long bull run in US stocks, said in a note that even after five weeks of declines, the S&P 500 is still mispriced for the current environment of the Federal Reserve tightening policy into slowing growth. According to his base scenario of “fire and ice,” he expects the S&P 500 to slide in the near term before climbing to 3,900 points next spring -- which is still about 2.5% below current levels -- on slowing earnings growth and elevated volatility. “We continue to believe that the US equity market is not priced for this slowdown in growth from current levels,” Wilson said in a note on Tuesday. “We expect equity volatility to remain elevated over the next 12 months.” He recommends defensive positioning with an overweight in health care, utilities and real estate stocks. The call from one of Wall Street’s most vocal bears is in sharp contrast to some strategists including Peter Oppenheimer at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., who said on Tuesday that the powerful selloff in stocks in the past weeks had created buying opportunities, with headwinds such as inflation and hawkish central banks already priced in. After capping their longest streak of weekly losses since 2011 last week, US equities bounced slightly on Tuesday. However, the recovery didn’t last and futures erased gains and tumbled on Wednesday after data showed US consumer prices rose more than forecast in April. READ: Goldman’s Oppenheimer Sees Value in $11 Trillion Stock Rout Berenberg strategists also took a cautious tone, saying that although it’s “tempting” to buy the dip, US stocks continue to look expensive amid margin pressures. The S&P 500 may be at risk of further downside toward 3,600 points -- down 10% from the Tuesday close -- before reaching a historically important technical support level. The 200-week moving average since 1986 has seen the US benchmark bounce back during all major bear markets, except for the tech bubble and the global financial crisis. Over in Europe, Morgan Stanley’s Graham Secker is staying cautious on the region’s equities and expects them to drop further given the challenging economic situation, the war in Ukraine and the risk of earnings downgrades in the second half of the year from falling margins. “Let’s keep it simple – the macro backdrop is very difficult for stocks,” Secker said in a note on Wednesday, adding that a reduction in Russian gas imports was the biggest bear case risk. “Although investor sentiment is low and equity valuations are reasonable, the difficult fundamental outlook is likely to drive stocks lower over the coming months.” Secker cut his rating on European mining and construction and materials stocks to neutral and said it was “too soon” to add cyclical exposure back into portfolios, while lifting food, beverage and tobacco shares to neutral. Morgan Stanley strategists are overweight the FTSE 100 and prefer defensives over cyclicals, staying overweight value shares versus growth with a defensive tilt. Strategists at Barclays Plc also said market action in Europe is turning more defensive on slowing growth and more hawkish monetary policy.

5/12/2022,"By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. stock market is off to brutal start in 2022. The S&P 500, which is widely considered to be the main benchmark for U.S. stock market performance, declined 13.3% through April, the steepest four-month drop to start any year since 1939. The index continues to fall in May and was down 16% year-to-date as of Tuesday's close, approaching the 20% threshold that some investors consider confirmation of a bear market. For the Nasdaq Composite, which is heavier on technology shares, the decline has been more severe, falling some 25% so far this year. WHAT IS WEIGHING ON STOCKS THIS YEAR? The S&P 500 started the year having more than doubled from the lows it hit in March 2020, an upswing that went into reverse almost immediately as the calendar flipped to 2022. The main factor cited by investors and analysts for the market's weakness is the policy change at the Federal Reserve. As the pandemic took hold, the U.S. central bank put in place emergency policies to stabilize the economy that investors say also emboldened buying of stocks and other riskier assets. But the Fed early in 2022 signaled it was pivoting to tighter monetary policy in order to tamp down surging inflation, a significant change to the investing environment. WHY HAS THE FED PIVOT HURT STOCKS? The Fed in March raised interest rates for the first time since 2018, boosting by 25 basis points. Earlier this month, the central bank raised rates by another 50 basis points - the biggest move in 22 years - and Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled similar increases could follow as it also starts unwinding assets accumulated during its fight against the pandemic's effects. The decisions have weighed on stocks in several ways. While equities have risen during many of the Fed's past rate-raising cycles, some investors worry that surging inflation and sky-high commodity prices could force the central bank to tighten more aggressively, potentially hurting growth and pushing the economy into a recession. At the same time, expectations of tighter Fed policy have pushed up previously dormant bond yields. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note has already roughly doubled this year to 3%, its first time above that level since late 2018, when the Fed was reaching the end of its last tightening cycle. With yields rising, bonds are a more competitive investment to stocks, with the 10-year Treasury yield about twice the level of the dividend yield for the S&P 500. Higher bond yields in particular dull the allure of technology and other high-growth sectors, which are valued for their potential cash flows and lose appeal when bond yields rise. Investors say that impact has been reflected in the outsized declines notched by some post-pandemic growth bets, with the Russell 1000 growth index down 24% this year. WHAT ELSE COULD BE CONTRIBUTING TO STOCK WEAKNESS? Beyond the Fed's change, Russia's war in Ukraine has fueled further economic uncertainty. For example, the turmoil has caused a supply shock that has helped drive up oil and other commodity prices, while also triggering particular concerns about Europe's economy. Other factors that have caused stock volatility recently include concerns over China's economy. Lockdowns in the country to control COVID-19 have weighed on production activity there. WHAT SIGNS ARE INVESTORS LOOKING FOR TO HALT DECLINES? Investors would like to see indications that U.S. inflation is peaking so the Fed can step back from potentially more aggressive actions. Wednesday's consumer price index release for April is the next key report to watch. Some investors are looking at technical indicators, such as whether the S&P 500 can hold key levels, such as 4,000, as well as particularly heavy days of downside volume to ""wash out"" the sellers, or the CBOE volatility index hitting certain heights.

5/12/2022,"Disney (DIS) reported second quarter financial results after the bell on Wednesday that missed on both the top and bottom lines, although net additions for its fledging streaming platform Disney+ came in above estimates, causing shares to climb as much as 5% in after-hours trading. However, Disney quickly erased those gains during the company's earnings call after CFO Christine McCarthy warned that the tough economic environment, enhanced by inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions and a tight labor market, could weigh on margins. Here are Disney's second quarter results compared to Wall Street's consensus estimates, as compiled by Bloomberg: Revenue: $19.25 billion vs. $20.11 billion estimate Adj. earnings per share: $1.08 vs. $1.17 estimate Disney+ subscribers: 7.9 million vs. 4.5 million expected ""Our strong results in the second quarter, including fantastic performance at our domestic parks and continued growth of our streaming services—with 7.9 million Disney+ subscribers added in the quarter and total subscriptions across all our DTC offerings exceeding 205 million—once again proved that we are in a league of our own,"" Disney CEO Bob Chapek said in a press release. ""As we look ahead to Disney’s second century, I am confident we will continue to transform entertainment by combining extraordinary storytelling with innovative technology to create an even larger, more connected, and magical Disney universe for families and fans around the world,"" the executive continued. After competitor Netflix's (NFLX) big subscriber miss last month (the first time the company had lost subscribers during a quarter in 10 years), analysts were cautiously optimistic when it came to Disney+, although a deceleration compared to previous quarters was expected. The company added 11.7 million subscribers in the first quarter of 2022, sharply topping analyst estimates. On a year-over-year comparison basis, the media giant reported a net add of 8.7 million in Q2 2021. The overall subscriber decline comes as inflation remains high, consumers cut costs, and competition intensifies. A lag in content has also been cause for concern. Still, Disney plans to spend a whopping $11 billion on streaming content this year, as part of its overall $26 billion budget for TV and film production. To compare, Netflix spent $17 billion on content in fiscal year 2021, with plans to hit $18 billion in 2022. Chapek explained on the earnings call that ""great content is going to drive our subs"" and that increased subscribers will, therefore, drive profitability. He also noted that the platform's upcoming ad-supported offering, set to hit the U.S. later this year, will create more choices and opportunity for subscribers. Disney+, which will open in 53 new markets in the the third quarter of 2022, has 137.7 million global subscribers to date, above expectations of 134.4 million. The company reiterated its target to bring on 230 million to 260 million subscribers to the service by the end of fiscal 2024. For context, Netflix's subscriber count sits at 221.64 million global subscribers. Beyond Disney+, the company will also lean on the theatrical rebound, with top titles like ""Thor: Love and Thunder"" and ""Avatar: The Way of Water"" set to debut later this year. But streaming was not the only positive growth story for Disney this quarter. The entertainment mecca's parks, experience and consumer products business swung to an operating profit of $1.76 billion, surpassing expectations of $1.6 billion and just below last quarter's operating profit of $2.5 billion. Revenue for the segment came in at $6.7 billion, nearing its pre-pandemic total of $7.6 billion in the final quarter of 2019. Unlike the shaky streaming side of the business, analysts remain fairly confident that Disney's sprawling theme parks — a consistently important element to the company's bottom line — will see continued robust growth amid the reopening trade. Chapek also doubled down during the earnings call, saying the parks segment, up 110%, is firing on ""all cylinders."" Still, possible headwinds include inflation impact and recession fears. ""Disney’s share price seems to fall daily as fears mount on both [direct-to-consumer] and recession for Parks,” Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall said in a recent note. ""We think sentiment on both is overdone. While recessionary fears may prove more temporary — and we expect solid Parks results — DTC is a proper Show Me story,"" he continued. On the earnings call, Disney CEO Bob Chapek was surprisingly not asked about the company's public battle with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who revoked the company's special tax district after Disney vowed to fight the Parental Rights in Education Act, or what critics have dubbed the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill. The controversial bill, which will go into effect on July 1, states, ""Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards."" Parents will be able to sue districts over violations. Chapek initially decided not to speak publicly on the matter, opting instead to work behind the scenes in an attempt to soften the legislation. It didn't work. The executive eventually reversed course following intense backlash over his belated response to the bill. He publicly denounced the act during the company's annual shareholder meeting on March 9, in addition to directly apologizing to employees in a company memo. Chapek, whose contract expires on February 28, 2023, has dealt with a fair amount of controversy during his tenure. In addition to the DeSantis drama and ""Don't Say Gay"" fallout, the executive came under further scrutiny following a now-settled breach-of-contract lawsuit with ""Black Widow"" actress Scarlett Johansson last summer. Disney has a market cap of just over $190 billion. Its shares, which hit a 52-week low of $104.79 earlier on Wednesday, have fallen more than 30% year-to-date.
