3/22/2022,"By Angelo Amante and Crispian Balmer ROME (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is due to address the Italian parliament on Tuesday, but a small number of lawmakers say they will shun the speech, arguing that his appearance will not help restore peace. Their snub highlights a strong pacifist strain in Italy, shaped partly by the country's disastrous involvement in World War Two. But it also reflects a pro-Russia vein that runs deep through some of the country's main political parties. Unusually for a Western nation, Italy had strong links with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, and these ties improved during President Vladimir Putin's long rule, making the country one of Russia's closest allies within the European Union. Prime Minister Mario Draghi has redressed the balance since taking office in 2021, promoting a vigorous, pro-NATO line, and all the major parties have condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine, even those that had an especially close relationship with Moscow -- Forza Italia, the 5-Star Movement and the League. However, at least 20 lawmakers have said they will snub Zelenskiy's appearance and criticised the decision to allow him to address both chambers -- an honour previously awarded to just Spain's King Juan Carlos and Pope John Paul II. Zelenskiy has already spoken via video to parliaments in Britain, the United States, Israel and Germany, and is expected on Tuesday to repeat his calls for more help to combat Russia. Senator Gianluigi Paragone told Reuters he would not be listening. ""We have already heard Zelenskiy's preaching and if we did what he wanted, it would lead us straight to war in Europe,"" said Paragone, who used to be in the 5-Star and has since formed an anti-EU group called Italexit. ARMS AN ISSUE Around 17 lawmakers in the Alternative group, almost all 5-Star dissidents, have also said they would boycott the speech. ""It is merely a marketing operation that will not help end hostilities,"" the lawmakers said in a statement, calling on Rome to do more to promote peace talks and criticising the Italian parliament for having voted to send arms to Ukraine. The vote in the lower chamber last week drew cross-party support, but dozens of parliamentarians failed to show up, including many members of the rightist League, whose head Matteo Salvini has previously praised Putin as a great world leader. At least one League politician, Vito Comencini, confirmed to Reuters that he would skip Zelenskiy's speech. He declined to explain his decision, but he has made clear his pro-Russia stance on social media, visiting St. Petersburg last week and handing over aid for people from the Donbass area of eastern Ukraine which rose up against Kyiv's rule in 2014. ""They are people who have been living in a war zone since 2014, guilty (only) of demanding that their demands be recognised,"" Comencini wrote on Facebook. Salvini himself has dialled down his previous fervent support for Moscow and has said he will listen to Zelenskiy. However, he has also said he will struggle to back the dispatch of weapons to Ukraine when the motion goes to the Senate in the coming days. ""I say with full honesty, I am in difficulty because a democratic culture does not stop bombs with other bombs, but with democracy (and) dialogue,"" Salvini told RAI TV last week.

3/22/2022,"Ukraine says it has killed 15,000 of Russia's troops since its invasion began. The country's military branch, the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, said on Monday that a large proportion of Russia's total invading troops are dead. Russia started its invasion on 24 February with an estimated force of 190,000 troops. Ukraine's military also claimed that it had taken out a number of the enemy's armoury and artillery, the Kyiv Independent reported. Watch: Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko says he cries 'every day' at destruction Putin has caused Officials said they had destroyed 1,535 armoured personnel carriers, 498 tanks, 969 vehicles, 240 pieces of artillery, 45 anti-aircraft systems, 80 rocket launcher systems, 97 planes and 121 helicopters. Meanwhile, eight people were reported dead on Monday following Russian shelling on a residential area and shopping centre in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. In the port city of Mariupol, which has been under heavy Russian bombardment, an estimated 300,000 people are trapped without food, water or power. Ukraine ignored a demand from Russia to give up the city by 5am Moscow time on Monday, saying the invaders' pledge to temporarily halt its attack could not be trusted.   It accused Russia of trying to starve out its citizens in the city. Ukrainian MP Inna Sovsun also claimed its citizens in Mariupol are being abducted and deported to ""distant parts of Russia"" to work in conditions akin to slave labour. Speaking to Times Radio, she said Russia was following “the logic of Nazi Germany”. “From what we know from the city mayor and the city council, is they are taking Ukrainian citizens,” she said. The UK's foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said she was ""appalled"" by the claims. On Sunday, a Russian bomb destroyed an art school in Mariupol where 400 people had taken shelter, with rescuers searching for people possibly trapped under the rubble. Only days before the shelling, there was a separate attack on a theatre in the city where more than 1,000 people were said to have been hiding.

After the government’s Homes for Ukraine scheme opened at the weekend, Javid said those arriving in the UK would get all the support they needed. Some 10,200 visas have been issued under the Ukraine family scheme as of 4pm on Sunday, the Home Office said on Monday. A total of 31,500 applications have been submitted so far.

President Biden said last week that Putin was a ""war criminal"" for sending tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine. ""Such statements from the American president, unworthy of a statesman of such high rank, put Russian-American relations on the verge of rupture,"" the ministry said in a statement. The Kremlin earlier described the comments as ""personal insults"" against Putin. The ministry also told Sullivan that hostile actions against Russia would receive a ""decisive and firm response"". Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour’s military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists.

3/22/2022,"Roman Abramovich's yacht was off the coast of Turkey on Monday, ship-tracking data shows. His $600 million yacht, Solaris, is ""scenic cruising"" without a port destination, per MarineTraffic. It might be trying to confuse people about its final destination, a MarineTraffic spokesperson said. A luxury superyacht owned by the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich that has been sailing without a destination for more than a week updated its status for the first time since leaving port, suggesting it has no immediate intention of docking, ship-tracking data shows. Solaris, a 140-feet vessel worth $600 million, was off the southwestern coast of Turkey and heading west, according to the tracking website MarineTraffic. On Monday, the website showed that the vessel's status changed to ""scenic cruising"" from ""awaiting orders,"" the status it had shown since leaving Tivat, Montenegro, on March 13. Georgios Hatzimanolis, a spokesperson for MarineTraffic, told Insider that though yachts and ships can change their status whenever they want, ""most likely in this instance"" Solaris is ""using the status to confuse people from where its final destination is."" ""Lots of speculation on if it will be Turkey, Israel, or even possibly the UAE,"" Hatzimanolis said. The locations of luxury assets owned by Russian oligarchs have been closely monitored since sanctions were levied against many of the country's elite in response to Moscow's ordering troops into Ukraine. European countries including Italy and France have seized yachts, private jets, and other assets from several sanctioned oligarchs. Abramovich, whose net worth is estimated at about $13.6 billion, according to Bloomberg, was sanctioned by the UK and the European Union, meaning his assets have been frozen and he's been barred from doing business there. Solaris had been docked in the Barcelona shipyard of the Spanish yacht-maintenance firm MB92 since late 2021. It left on March 8, shortly before Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea Football Club, was sanctioned. Before the announcement of sanctions, some of Russia's wealthiest people sought to move their expensive boats and private jets to jurisdictions where they might be able to protect them from seizure. Abramovich's other superyacht, Eclipse, said to be worth $700 million, was just off the coast of Crete, a Greek island in the Mediterranean Sea, on Monday, according to MarineTraffic. The yacht has been sailing since it left St. Martin in the Caribbean on February 21, the ship-tracking website shows.

3/22/2022,"After noticing that his intake of sweet snacks had increased significantly in recent months, YouTuber Cam Jones decides to remove all food with added sugar from his diet for 30 days to see what kind of impact it might have on his health and overall wellbeing. But all it takes is his first ""cursed"" trip to the grocery store on day one of the challenge to understand that this will be more difficult than he first thought.
 ""I quickly realized how much added sugar is in the stuff that I normally buy,"" he says. ""There's even added sugar in the things I assumed were healthy, and the more I look at labels, the less things I add to my cart."" It also doesn't take long for the early side effects of giving up added sugar to make themselves known, either: Cam soon begins to experience intense cravings, a drop in his energy levels and ability to focus on work, and headaches. Looking back, he believes that is a result of his brain missing the extra boost of dopamine that it gets when eating sugar. ""This can lead to overconsumption and reliance, and then withdrawals,"" he says. ""On the plus side, withdrawal symptoms are only supposed to last a few weeks, so hopefully this is the hardest part and things can only go up from here."" Cam turns his attention to making alternatives to his favorite snacks, including kale chips and sweet potato fries, and stocks up on fruit so that he can still enjoy something sweet when the craving takes him. ""Once I get a feel for the snack situation, things really start to look up,"" he says. In the final two weeks of the challenge, Cam finally starts to feel some positive effects. ""I feel like on the whole I'm eating healthier and being more strategic with my meals to help stay full and fend off cravings,"" he says. ""I'm also starting to notice my energy levels evening out. I've been able to get some good workouts in without feeling exhausted later on in the day."" However, he has to admit that this restrictive diet ""takes a lot of the fun out of eating"" and makes it harder to be spontaneous. ""It even limits how you can celebrate special occasions,"" he says. ""I don't think it's helpful to treat sugar as a bad thing, but what I do think is important is being in control of how much you consume on a regular basis,"" he concludes. ""For me, I feel like these last 30 days have really helped me regain some of that control and build my intuition so I can be smarter about my eating habits going forward.""

 A Ukrainian historian wrote in an opinion piece in The New York Times on Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin made two major miscalculations regarding the invasion of Ukraine. Yaroslav Hrytsak, a historian and professor at the Ukrainian Catholic University, wrote that ""Russian aggression has been met with heroic Ukrainian resistance and united the West."" He referred to Putin as a ""master tactician but inept strategist"" and said he has made his most profound miscalculation by not anticipating a response from the West and Ukrainian resistance. ""First, he was hoping that, as had been the case with his war against Georgia, the West would tacitly swallow his aggression against Ukraine. A unified response from the West was not something he expected. Second, since in his mind Russians and Ukrainians were one nation, Mr. Putin believed Russian troops needed barely to enter Ukraine to be welcomed with flowers. This never materialized,"" he wrote. Hrytsak wrote that despite Putin likely escalating the conflict further, ""he is far from the military victory he sought."" He added that Putin believes ""he is at war not with Ukraine but with the West in Ukrainian lands."" ""It's essential to grasp this point. The only way to defeat him is to turn his belief - that Ukraine is fighting not alone but with the help of the West and as part of the West - into a waking nightmare,"" Hrytsak wrote. The piece comes more than three weeks after Putin launched an invasion of Ukraine, where it has yet to capture the capital of Kyiv. According to Hrytsak, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, which saw the annexation of Crimea along with the capture of parts of the Donbas region under Russian-backed separatists, confirmed that the distinction between Ukrainians and Russians ""lies not in language, religion or culture - here they are relatively close - but in political traditions.""

3/22/2022,"MOSCOW — The Russian military says it has hit a shopping mall on the outskirts of the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv because it has been used to store rockets. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov charged Monday that the Ukrainian forces were using the shopping mall to reload multiple rocket launchers and store rockets used for shelling Russian troops. He said that a battery of multiple rocket launchers and ammunition for them were destroyed in the strike. The defense ministry spokesman’s claims could not independently verified. The shopping center in the densely populated Podil district was reduced to a smoldering ruin after being hit late Sunday by shelling that killed eight people, according to Ukrainian emergency officials. The attack shattered every window in a neighboring high-rise. ___ KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR: — AP video journalist gives riveting fist-hand account of the siege of Mariupol — Russia demands Mariupol lay down arms but Ukraine says no — ‘No city anymore’: Mariupol survivors take train to safety — Biden adds stop in Poland, crucial ally in the Ukraine crisis, to his trip this week to Europe Go to https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine for more coverage ___ OTHER DEVELOPMENTS TODAY: MOSCOW — The Russian military says it will continue using its state-of-the-art hypersonic missile to hit particularly important targets in Ukraine. Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Monday that the Kinzhal hypersonic missile “has proven its efficiency in destroying heavily fortified special facilities.” He said that a Kinzhal missile was used Friday to hit a Soviet-era arsenal for storing missiles near the western town of Deliatyn in the Carpathian Mountains, the first time the new weapon was used in combat. It also was used in a strike on the fuel depot in Kostiantynivka near the Black Sea port of Mykolaiv over the weekend. Konashenkov noted that Kinzhal was used for these strikes due to its high kinetic energy and its ability to penetrate defenses. Konashenkov said that Kinzhal missiles were fired at a distance of more than 1,000 kilometers (over 620 miles). Kinzhal, one of an array of hypersonic weapons developed by Russian in recent years, has a range of 2,000 kilometers(1,250 miles) and flies at a speed 10 times the speed of sound. It’s carried by specially redesigned MiG-31 fighter jets. ___ NEW YORK -- Russia has warned that relations with the U.S. are “on the verge of a breach” and summoned the U.S. ambassador for an official protest against President Joe Biden’s criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin. A Russian Foreign Ministry statement Monday referred to “recent unacceptable statements” by Biden about Putin. Biden referred to Putin last week as a “war criminal” in relation to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Foreign Ministry says that at the meeting with U.S. ambassador to Moscow John Sullivan “it was emphasized that remarks such as these by the American President, which are unworthy of a state figure of such a high rank, put Russian-American relations on the verge of a breach.” ___ WARSAW, Poland – Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki says he is encouraging Switzerland to take bolder steps in cutting off Russian oligarchs who support Russian leaders from the billions of U.S. dollars they have in Swiss banks or in business there. Morawiecki spoke Monday at a joint news conference with visiting Swiss President Ignazio Cassis. They held talks about the situation in Ukraine, which was invaded by Russian troops Feb. 24. Morawiecki noted that Russia’s richest businessmen have deposited billions of U.S. dollars in Swiss banks, were doing business there and had other assets. He said the assets could be used to help Ukraine rebuild from the war’s destruction. Cassis noted that Switzerland has joined the European Union’s sanctions on Russia and has also has frozen the bank accounts and business of Russian oligarchs who are on the EU sanctions lists and also of some others. Poland’s government is working on amendments to the constitution that would allow for the seizure of Russia’s assets in Poland. ___ STOCKHOLM — Sweden’s Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said Monday that a NATO drill in Norway that was planned before the invasion of Ukraine sends “an important signal that there is cooperation, cooperation and a readiness to defend our territory.” The visit to the exercise Cold Response “shouldn’t be interpreted as a step toward a Swedish NATO membership,” Andersson told reporters. Sweden has a close partnership with NATO and that “has deepened during the crisis.” Support for joining NATO has surged to record levels in non-Alliance members Finland and Sweden. ___ LONDON — Britain is accusing the Russian state of being behind hoax calls to two government ministers by an imposter posing as the prime minister of Ukraine. Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said the hoaxer was able to speak to him on a video call Thursday. Home Secretary Priti Patel said she had received a similar call, and Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said an unsuccessful attempt was made to speak to her. Wallace said he became suspicious and hung up after the caller “posed several misleading questions.” He accused Russia of “dirty tricks.” Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman, Max Blain, said Monday that “the Russian state was responsible for the hoax calls made to government ministers last week.” ___ BERLIN — Germany’s Buchenwald concentration camp memorial says Boris Romanchenko, who survived camps at Buchenwald, Peenemuende, Dora and Bergen-Belsen during World War II, was killed Friday when his home in Kharkiv was attacked.

Romanchenko was vice president of the International Buchenwald-Dora Committee. Romanchenko was 96, German news agency dpa reported. ___ NEW YORK — Russia’s central bank has cautiously reopened bond trading on the Moscow exchange for the first time since the country invaded Ukraine. The price of Russia’s ruble-denominated government debt fell Monday, sending borrowing costs higher. Stock trading has remained closed, with no word on when it might reopen. The central bank bought bonds to support prices. It has imposed wide-ranging restrictions on financial transactions to try to stabilize markets and combat the severe fallout from Western sanctions that have sent the ruble sharply lower against the U.S. dollar and the euro. Ratings agencies have downgraded Russia’s bonds to “junk” status. Russia’s finance ministry last week flirted with default by threatening to pay foreign holders of dollar bonds in massively devalued rubles before sending the money in dollars. Stocks last traded on Feb. 25, the day after the invasion started and sent the main stock index sharply lower. ___ VILNIUS, Lithuania — The Dutch prime minister says that the European Union should be careful when imposing new sanctions on Russian gas and oil companies because some nations are still heavily dependent on these resources, “We must be sure that energy independence has sufficient gas and oil in the system. It is very important for the Netherlands, Germany, France, and the countries of eastern Europe,” Mark Rutte told reporters after meeting Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda. “We need to do this as soon as possible, but we cannot do that tomorrow.” Nauseda replied saying that Lithuania invested heavily into energy security for decades and now is ready for a full boycott of Russian oil and gas. “Now that the masks have fallen, it is time to move forward implementing decisions that are absolutely necessary for Europe to feel safer, more independent and resistant to external shocks,” Nauseda said. ___ KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory agency says the radiation monitors around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, site of the world’s worst meltdown in 1986, have stopped working. In a statement Monday, the agency also said there are no longer firefighters available in the region to protect forests tainted by decades of radioactivity as the weather warms. The plant was seized by Russian forces on Feb. 24. According to Monday’s statement, the combination of risks could mean a “significant deterioration” of the ability to control the spread of radiation not just in Ukraine but beyond the country’s borders in weeks and months to come. Management of the Chernobyl plant said Sunday that 50 staff members who had been working nonstop since the Russian takeover have been rotated out and replaced. ___ LVIV, Ukraine -- Authorities in Odesa have accused Russian forces of damaging civilian houses in a strike on the Black Sea port city on Monday. The city council said no one was killed in the strike and that emergency services quickly extinguished a fire. Mayor Hennady Trukhanov visited the site and said “we will not leave Odessa and we will fight for our city.” Odesa is in southwestern Ukraine and has largely avoided the fighting so far, though Russia has ships operating off the Black Sea coast. ___ KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s prosecutor general said a Russian shell struck a chemical plant outside the city of Sumy a little after 3 a.m. Monday, causing a leak in a 50-ton tank of ammonia that took hours to contain. Russian military spokesman Igor Konashenkov claimed the leak was a “planned provocation” by Ukrainian forces to falsely accuse Russia of a chemical attack. Konashenkov also said an overnight cruise missile strike hit a Ukrainian military training center in the Rivne region. He said 80 foreign and Ukrainian troops were killed. Vitaliy Koval, the head of the Rivne regional military administration, confirmed a twin Russian missile strike on a training center there early Monday but offered no details about injuries or deaths. ___ NEW YORK — Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov says more progress must be made in talks with Ukraine before Russian President Vladimir Putin can meet his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Peskov says that “in order to talk about a meeting of the two presidents, first it’s necessary to do the homework, it’s necessary to hold talks and agree the results.” He adds that “so far significant movement has not been achieved” in the talks and that “there are not any agreements which they could commit to” at a joint meeting. Ukraine and Russia’s delegations have held several rounds of talks both in person and more recently via video link. Zelenskyy has said he would be prepared to meet Putin directly to seek agreements on key issues. ___ BRUSSELS — EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell is accusing Russia of committing war crimes in Ukraine, most notably in the besieged port city of Mariupol where hundreds of civilians have been killed. Borrell says that “what’s happening in Mariupol is a massive war crime. Destroying everything, bombarding and killing everybody in an indiscriminate manner. This is something awful.” The International Criminal Court in the Netherlands is gathering evidence about any possible war crimes in Ukraine, but Russia, like the United States, does not recognize the tribunal’s jurisdiction. ___ JERUSALEM — Israel’s prime minister says that while there have been advances in cease-fire talks between Russia and Ukraine, “very large” gaps remain between the two sides. Naftali Bennett, who has acted as intermediary between the two warring countries in recent weeks, said at a conference on Monday that Israel “will continue — together with other friends in the world — to try and bridge the gap and bring an end to the war.” Israel has good relations with both Ukraine and Russia and has acted as a broker between the two sides since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. Bennett has held multiple phone calls with both leaders in recent weeks and flew to Moscow earlier this month to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. ___ LJUBLJANA, Slovenia — Slovenia says it plans to send the country’s diplomatic representatives back to Ukraine later this week. Prime Minister Janez Jansa has urged other European Union nations to do the same. He said on Twitter late on Sunday that “Ukraine needs diplomatic support.” Slovenia’s diplomats left Ukraine with the start of the Russian invasion on Feb. 24 as other countries withdrew their representatives as well. Jansa visited Kyiv last week along with the prime ministers of Poland and the Czech Republic. He has said after the visit that Ukraine was feeling abandoned and urged the EU to send a bloc’s representative there. ___ LONDON — Britain’s defense ministry says heavy fighting is continuing north of Kyiv as Russian forces press on with a stalled effort to encircle Ukraine’s capital city. In an update Monday on social media, the ministry said Russian forces advancing on the city from the northeast have stalled, and troops advancing from the direction of Hostomel to the northwest have been pushed back by fierce Ukrainian resistance. It said the bulk of Russian forces were more than 25 kilometers (15 miles) from the city center. U.K. officials said that “despite the continued lack of progress, Kyiv remains Russia’s primary military objective and they are likely to prioritise attempting to encircle the city over the coming weeks.” ___ LVIV, Ukraine — Emergency officials have contained an ammonia leak at a chemical plant that contaminated wide area in the eastern Ukrainian city of Sumy, officials said Monday. Sumy regional governor Dmytro Zhyvytskyy didn’t say what caused the leak, which spread about 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) in all directions from the Sumykhimprom plant. The plant is on the eastern outskirts of the city, which has a population of about 263,000 and has been regularly shelled by Russian troops in recent weeks. ___ KYIV, Ukraine — Shelling in a Kyiv neighborhood has devastated a shopping center, leaving a flattened ruin still smoldering Monday morning in the midst of high-rise towers. Overnight shelling near the city center late Sunday left at least eight dead according to emergency officials. The force of the explosion shattered every window in the high-rise next door and twisted their metal frames. In the distance, the sound of artillery rang out as firefighters picked their way through the destruction in the densely populated Podil district. ___ LVIV, Ukraine — An ammonia leak at a chemical plant in the eastern Ukrainian city of Sumy has contaminated an area with a radius of more than 2.5 kilometers (about 1.5 miles), officials said early Monday. Sumy regional governor Dmytro Zhyvytskyy didn’t say what caused the leak. The Sumykhimprom plant is on the eastern outskirts of the city, which has a population of about 263,000 and has been regularly shelled by Russian troops in recent weeks. “For the center of Sumy, there is no threat now, since the wind does not blow on the city,” said Zhyvytskyy. He said the nearby village of Novoselytsya, about 1.5 kilometers (1 mile) southeast of Sumy, is under threat. Emergency crews were working to contain the leak. ___ NEW YORK — The Russian military has offered the Ukrainian troops defending the strategic port of Mariupol to lay down arms and exit the city via humanitarian corridors, but that proposal was quickly rejected by the Ukrainian authorities. Col. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev said Sunday that all Ukrainian soldiers could leave the Azov Sea port Monday using safe routes for evacuating civilians that had been previously agreed with Ukraine and head to areas controlled by the Ukrainian authorities. He said that “all those who lay down arms will be guaranteed a safe exit from Mariupol.” Mizintsev added that Russia will wait until 5 a.m. Monday for a written Kyiv’s response to the Russian proposal for the Ukrainian troops to leave Mariupol but didn’t say what action Russia will take if its “humanitarian offer” is rejected. Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in remarks carried by Ukrainska Pravda news outlet that Kyiv already had told Russia that “there can be no talk about surrender and laying down weapons.” She rejected the Russian statement as “manipulation.” Mizintsev said that the deliveries of humanitarian supplies to the city will immediately follow if the Ukrainian troops agree to leave the city. He added that civilians will be free to choose whether to leave Mariupol or stay in the city. ___ KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced the Russian bombing of a school in Mariupol where civilians took refuge. Speaking in a video address early Monday, Zelenskyy said about 400 civilians were taking shelter at the art school in the besieged Azov Sea port city when it was struck by a Russian bomb. “They are under the rubble, and we don’t know how many of them have survived,” he said. “But we know that we will certainly shoot down the pilot who dropped that bomb, like about 100 other such mass murderers whom we already have downed.” Zelenskyy, who spoke to members of the Israeli parliament via video link on Sunday, thanked Israel for its efforts to broker talks with Russia. The Ukrainian president also said that he had a call Sunday with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson to discuss support for Ukraine during this week’s summit of the Group of Seven and NATO.",World/Associated Press,Live updates: Russian military says it has hit shopping mall,https://news.yahoo.com/live-updates-least-4-killed-061854967.html
