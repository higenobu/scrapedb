3/11/2022,"A corporate exodus from Russia in response to its military invasion of Ukraine has seen more than 300 U.S. and multinational companies sever business ties with the country — and the list is growing by the minute. But even as many flee, a number of big-name firms have remained mum. Among them are U.S. consumer favorites including Dunkin’ Donuts, Subway, and Mondelez (MDLZ). Hotel giant Marriott (MAR) can also be found on the docket of corporations that have not suspended or reduced their exposure to Russia’s market. Since President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine began on Feb. 24 — which has so far led to 2 million refugees and more than 1,000 civilian casualties recorded by the United Nations — around 330 companies have withdrawn from Russia in protest of the Kremlin as of March 10, according to a list compiled by Yale professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld and his research team. Still, 39 continue to operate in the country despite mounting pressure to take action. Dunkin’ Donuts operates 150 locations in Russia, according to the research by Sonnenfeld and his colleagues, while Subway has 446 franchise locations in the country. American multinational food and beverage maker Mondelez — the parent of brands like Oreo, Ritz, and Chips Ahoy! — has an even bigger footprint in the country that it has yet to give up. Mondelez generates about 3.5% of its revenue from Russia, or about $1 billion. Meanwhile, Marriott International racks in 4.3% of its revenue, or about $440 million, from Russian operations, per Sonnenfeld’s data. The list remains fluid, but U.S. publicly-traded companies that have failed to cease business in Russia include cosmetics company Coty Inc. (COTY), pharmaceutical company AbbVie (ABBV), and cloud computing company Citrix (CTXS). After mounting pressure, Burger King, which has more than 800 franchise locations across Russia according to Sonnenfeld’s research, became the latest fast-food restaurateur to halt all corporate support to the Russian market in response to the war, its parent company Restaurant Brands International (QSR) said Thursday. The company joins other fast food peers that have arrived late to the party but heeded to criticism, including McDonald's Corporation (MCD), Starbucks (SBUX), Coca-Cola (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP). “We serve millions of Russian customers each day who count on McDonald’s,” McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a statement Tuesday. “At the same time, our values mean we cannot ignore the needless human suffering unfolding in Ukraine.” According to new MKM Partners research note, McDonald's suspending operations in Russia will cost the company $50 million a month. Sonnenfeld’s list can be found here and is updated every hour to reflect new announcements from companies in real time. “When this list was first published on Feb. 28, only several dozen companies had announced their departure,” he said on the website. — Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

3/11/2022,"By Humeyra Pamuk and Daphne Psaledakis WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Russian President Vladimir Putin has rejected every off-ramp offered by the United States to de-escalate the conflict in Ukraine and has, on the contrary, stepped up his military campaign, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday. ""We've sought to provide possible off-ramps to President Putin. He's the only one who can decide whether or not to take them. So far, every time there's been an opportunity to do just that, he's pressed the accelerator and continued down this horrific road that he's been pursuing,"" Blinken said at a joint news conference with his British counterpart Liz Truss. ""He has a clear plan right now to brutalize Ukraine but to what end?"" Blinken said, adding that Ukrainians have shown that they would not accept any ""puppet regime"" that Putin might try to install to replace the elected Ukrainian government. ""If he tries to enforce such a puppet regime by keeping Russian forces in Ukraine, it will be a long, bloody, drawn-out mess,"" Blinken said. Senior U.S. defense officials last month assessed that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is designed to 'decapitate' Ukraine's government. More than 2 million people have fled Ukraine since Putin launched the land, sea and air invasion on Feb 24. Moscow calls its action a ""special military operation"" to disarm its neighbor and dislodge leaders it calls ""neo-Nazis."" The war has swiftly cast Russia into economic isolation as well as drawing almost universal international condemnation. The United States on Tuesday banned imports of Russian oil, while Western companies are rapidly pulling out of the Russian market. Russian forces hold territory stretching along Ukraine's northeast border, the east and the southeast. Fighting has taken place in the outskirts of the capital Kyiv, while Ukraine's second city Kharkiv is under bombardment. Blinken has also slammed Russia for not allowing safe passage to civilians stuck in cities under heavy bombardment. ""The Kremlin's proposals to create humanitarian corridors leading into Russia and Belarus are absurd,"" he said. Russia earlier this week had offered Ukrainians escape routes to Russia and its close ally Belarus, a proposal that a spokesperson for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said was ""completely immoral.""
