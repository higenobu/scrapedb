2/2/2022,"How do you switch over from Spotify to another music service? What are the options? And which service pays artists the most? The ongoing controversy over Spotify’s flagship podcaster Joe Rogan, whose vaccine misinformation has led to musicians pulling their music from the platform, has also caused a lot of listeners to look for alternatives. Spotify reportedly accounts for 31% of the total music streaming market, more than double its nearest competitor – Apple Music – at 15%.  Whether you’re motivated by joining Neil Young and Joni Mitchell in their boycott, or you’re just interested in seeing the alternatives, it can seem daunting to make the switch after years of being with the service. But it is really easy. Streaming services tend to not have lock-in contracts, so if you’re looking to switch to another service, the first step would be cancelling your existing subscription. Unfortunately, Spotify doesn’t make it possible to cancel through its phone apps, so you’ll need to log in via a web browser and cancel your premium subscription through the account settings function. Depending on when you subscribed, you’ll be able to keep the premium features until the next payment was due. So what are the options? When Apple Music launched, it felt clunky and limited. But it has come a long way in the past few years, with vast improvements to its functionality, music selection (75m songs), radio, playlists and other features like music videos which Spotify doesn’t have. The user experience now seems much closer to Spotify. Apple also has launched lossless and spatial audio for a better quality of listen. Lossless audio is something Spotify promised in 2021 but has not launched. If you’re already in the Apple ecosystem this is definitely the best option, but there is also an Android app. Apple offers three months for free to new users but after that subscriptions are A$11.99 (£9.99) a month or A$119 (£99) a year, with family plans at A$17.99 (£14.99) a month. There are also bundled subscription deals with Apple’s other services, such as iCloud storage and Apple TV+. If you pay for a YouTube premium subscription – A$14.99 (£11.99) a month – you get YouTube Music for free. It has about 60m songs and you get access to YouTube videos along with it. The audio quality is reportedly not as good as other services but it does have playlists and radio stations and other features you would see elsewhere. As with Apple Music and its ecosystem, if you’re already an Android user, this is an easier option for you. Australians paying for Amazon Prime can already access a limited version of Amazon music (2m songs in SD only), or it’s A$11.99 a month for the full service. In the UK, it’s £7.99 a month to add to Prime, or £9.99 a month for non-Prime customers. It has lossless and spatial audio tracks, 75m songs, podcasts, playlists, and integrates with Amazon’s other technologies. Young has been promoting an offer with Amazon for four months of free music for new sign-ups to the service this week. If you want to avoid giving three of the largest tech companies your money, though, there are a growing number of other options. Tidal has always been pitched as the service that compensates artists the best and offers the best audio quality. It has a catalogue of 80m tracks and a free tier that operates similar to Spotify’s. Up from that are A$11.99 (£9.99) and $23.99 (£19.99) plans, the latter of which rewards the artist you listen to the most each month with 10% of your subscription fee. In addition to high-quality audio and all the expected features, Tidal has more than 350,000 videos and concert live streams. Other non-major companies offering streaming services includes Napster (yes, the former peer-to-peer file sharing service has gone legal), Qobuz and Pandora. The biggest issue for people looking to switch is transferring your long-curated playlists. This is made easier through third-party services. If you want it to be fast you’ll have to pay but if you don’t have many to transfer or have the time, you can usually convert one playlist at a time for free. The most popular is the app SongShift (although it is only available on iOS) and Soundiiz (which runs in a web browser). You’ll need to give whichever app you choose access to the accounts you are switching over but you can remove access once you are done. The services will usually flag if a song on the playlist can’t be found. Sometimes it’s as simple as a mismatch with the exact name of the song and it can be found as a different mix or title. The companies tend to keep the information about how much they pay artists for each stream a closely guarded secret but a report from Tricordist in 2020 gives us a picture of the rough payments artists can expect. According to the report, Spotify pays US$0.00348 a stream, Apple Music pays US$0.00675 a stream, Amazon pays US$0.00426, Google pays US$0.00554, and Tidal pays US$0.00876. Surprisingly, the fitness company Peloton comes out on top of the list, paying US$0.03107 a stream. Napster also rates higher than others at US$0.00916. It’s all still shockingly low for artists but the best option would probably be Tidal. In addition to the streaming rate being slightly higher than average, Tidal is also directly paying artists 10% of its upper-tier plan for each user – depending on which artist the user streams most. But if you want to support artists more directly, you can buy vinyl, or digital copies of the music through iTunes or similar services, or pay directly through Bandcamp or Soundcloud. Remember, if you buy an album from bandcamp, it's around the financial equivalent to the artist of you streaming their music every day for 3 years.",News/Technology,Four alternatives to Spotify: swapping is easier than you think,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/02/four-alternatives-to-spotify-swapping-is-easier-than-you-think
2/2/2022,"Central to the levelling up white paper are what are termed 12 “national missions” to be achieved, all by 2030, many of them phrased in fairly general terms. This is what the missions set out: To increase pay, employment and productivity in every part of the UK, with each containing “a globally competitive city” and a smaller gap between top performing and other areas. Public transport connectivity across the UK to be “significantly closer to the standards of London” including integrated ticketing and simpler fares. A “significant” increase in primary school children reaching expected standards in reading, writing and maths. For England – education policy is devolved – this will mean at least 90% meeting expected standards, with at least a one-third increase for this metric in the worst performing areas. A “significant” rise in the numbers completing high-quality skills training across the UK. In England, the target is for 200,000 more doing this, including 80,000 in the lowest skilled areas. A narrowing in healthy life expectancy between the UK areas where it is highest and lowest, with the overall average healthy life expectancy rising by five years by 2035. An improvement in perceived wellbeing in all parts of the UK, with a narrowed gap between areas with the highest and lowest levels. A rise across the whole UK of “pride in place”, defined as “people’s satisfaction with their town centre and engagement in local culture and community”, with a narrowing of gaps between areas with the highest and lowest levels. An increase in the number of first-time home buyers in all UK areas. The “ambition” is for a 50% fall in the number of rented homes deemed non-decent, including the biggest improvements in worst-performing areas. An overall fall in homicide, serious violence, and neighbourhood crime, focused on worst-affected areas. A devolution deal for “every part of England that wants one”, with powers “at or approaching the highest level of devolution and a simplified, long-term funding settlement”.

2/2/2022,"Targets to reduce inequalities across society by 2030 are to be enshrined in law as part of long-awaited levelling up proposals to be published today, amid new rows over funding for the government’s headline policy. Michael Gove will promise to “call time on the postcode lottery” of inequalities across Britain, setting 12 legally binding “missions” to improve health, living standards, transport, crime and wellbeing by the end of the decade.  Announcing the government’s levelling up strategy, the communities secretary will say that every area of England will have the chance to create a “London-style” metro mayor as part of what he claims is the biggest shift of power from Whitehall to local areas in modern times. The levelling up white paper comes with Boris Johnson desperate to shift the public debate away from lockdown parties and on to what he says is the guiding aim of his premiership. However, critics warned that the government is not clear about how it will achieve its 12 “missions”, which include everything from cutting crime to boosting skill levels in “left-behind” regions, and that there is insufficient funding behind the plans. Labour denounced it as a series of slogans. The new levelling up targets include increasing taxpayer-funded research and development outside London and the south-east by 40%; boosting “perceived wellbeing” in every part of the country and improving “pride in place”, defined as “people’s satisfaction with their town centre and engagement in local culture and community”; and bringing local transport connectivity across the UK “significantly closer to the standards of London”. Gove said: “For decades, too many communities have been overlooked and undervalued. As some areas have flourished, others have been left in a cycle of decline. The UK has been like a jet firing on only one engine. Levelling up and this white paper [are] about ending this historic injustice and calling time on the postcode lottery.” Ministers will give government departments a legal duty to report on their progress against the missions – an approach used by Tony Blair’s government in tackling child poverty, and subsequently rejected by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition. Gove hopes this approach will help to force Whitehall departments to work together towards a coherent set of objectives. It may also give his department bargaining power in future tussles with the Treasury. However, shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy said there was little substance in the new plans. “Ministers have had two-and-a-half years to get this right and all we have been given is more slogans and strategies, with few new ideas. “High streets will only thrive when people have money in their pockets to spend. We need good jobs, decent wages, genuinely affordable housing and action to deal with the unfolding cost of living crisis so people can spend on their high streets and young people no longer have to get out to get on.” Gove was handed the levelling up portfolio by Johnson in last autumn’s reshuffle. Downing Street believes achieving tangible progress will be key to holding on to the former Labour “red wall” seats outside London and south-east England, which the Tories won in 2019. Gove’s department was beefed up significantly, with Johnson’s levelling up adviser Neil O’Brien, the MP for Harborough, made a junior minister. Gove has also been advised by the former Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane. One person who had been briefed on the plans said: “The 12 missions are … targets about how you measure success and they’re all over the place. One is about raising life expectancy and it literally had ‘by X’ in the draft when I saw it.” They said Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, had “pretty much killed off all the big ideas in the white paper over the last few months” and that the announcements amounted to incremental progress rather than a radical policy shift. Another said Gove and his officials had been managing expectations by telling local leaders “this is a start that outlines the direction of travel” rather than promising significant new money and powers. They added: “It sounds like Michael Gove wants to move in the right direction but there is not an awful lot of money. Whether that is because the Treasury has refused or whether there’s internal politics at play, we don’t know.” Sunak has already announced a total of £11bn to be spent on a series of levelling up funds – some of which will be allocated by Gove’s Department for Levelling up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC). Fresh questions about the department’s ability to deliver on the government’s ambitious promises are raised in a new report from the National Audit Office (NAO), which criticises it for failing to monitor past expenditure effectively. “DLUHC has a limited understanding of what has worked well in previous local growth programmes due to a lack of consistent evaluation or monitoring,” the NAO said. “By failing to conduct evaluations, DLUHC has wasted opportunities to learn lessons to inform future interventions, and it does not know whether previous policies achieved their aims.” A third person briefed on the hefty white paper described it as “solid” but warned that it is focused on spatial inequalities – narrowing the gaps between the best and worst-performing regions – rather than, for example, narrowing the gap between rich and poor. “It’s levelling up places: it’s not levelling up society,” they said. Gove will announce a raft of other specific policies, encompassing everything from extending the decent homes standard to include private rental properties, to scrapping rules that mean the majority of public funding on housing ends up being spent in London and the south-east. The government will also fund improvements in 20 new towns and cities, including Wolverhampton and Sheffield, though Nandy has already criticised those plans as reheated. As part of what he is claiming will be a “devolution revolution”, Gove will say the government has already begun talks on new “county deals” with nine new areas including Durham, Hull and east Yorkshire, and Devon. Some Tory MPs have already privately questioned the makeup of the proposed new metro mayoral regions, however, with the one for the east Midlands – expected to centre on Nottingham – causing particular disquiet.",News/Politics,Levelling up: Gove calls time on ‘postcode lottery’ as strategy launched,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/02/levelling-up-gove-calls-time-on-postcode-lottery-as-strategy-launched
2/2/2022,"The government has been warned by an influential group of MPs to urgently tackle a “fraud epidemic” across Britain, amid concerns about the increasing financial toll on consumers and taxpayers from economic crime. The Commons Treasury committee said ministers needed to bring in fresh laws and beef up resources for fighting fraud after a dramatic surge in scams during the coronavirus pandemic.  It said there had been a 43% jump in fraud and computer misuse between June 2019 and June 2021. Publishing a report as pressure mounts on the government to tackle fraud after the shock resignation of Lord Agnew last week, the cross-party group of MPs called for law enforcement to be appropriately resourced to tackle the scale of the problem. A Treasury and Cabinet Office minister with responsibility for counter-fraud, Agnew announced his resignation during a speech at the House of Lords dispatch box, saying that the government’s performance in tackling fraud in Covid-19 support schemes had been “nothing less than woeful”. Acknowledging his resignation in a critical report for the government, the Treasury committee said urgent reforms were needed to identify and punish fraud, as well as to improve the level of protection for consumers when using online services. The committee called on the government to enact long-delayed reforms to Companies House, the registrar for firms, saying higher incorporation fees and tighter identity checks were needed to prevent fraudsters from hiding their identities behind UK businesses to launder money and conduct crime. The powerful committee of MPs said it was pushing for the government to set out legislation to tackle fraud in an economic crime bill. It comes after Agnew warned last week that ministers had “foolishly rejected” calls for the bill to be introduced in the current parliament. The committee said the government needed to consider whether the governance of economic crime should be centralised in a single department, with a single enforcement body for fighting fraud and scams rather than the “bewildering” number of agencies currently responsible. “The government must consider why economic crime seems not to be a priority for law enforcement, and how it can ensure it becomes one. It must ensure that law enforcement agencies are appropriately resourced to tackle the scale of the problem,” the Treasury committee warned. Calling on internet giants to take greater steps to protect consumers, the report said more responsibility could be placed on companies to reimburse consumers who are victims of fraud. “The government should seriously consider whether online companies should be required to contribute compensation when fraud is conducted using their platforms,” it said. Rishi Sunak told MPs on Tuesday that the government was “going after each and every person who we suspect of defrauding the taxpayer”, as Labour pressed the chancellor on Covid-related fraud in the Commons. The government has estimated that £4.9bn of lending on its Covid-19 bounce back loan scheme for small businesses was fraudulent, accounting for about 11% of the total programme. Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, told the Commons: “Schoolboy errors, a combination of arrogance, indolence and ignorance, nothing less than woeful. Not my words, but the words of former Treasury minister Lord Agnew.” More action was required to protect consumers from fraud, the committee said. In a series of recommendations, it said ministers needed to consider regulation to protect consumers from fraud and money laundering in the crypto-asset industry. There has been a sharp rise in scams using bitcoin, non-fungible tokens and other crypto-assets amid their growing popularity. Mel Stride, the chair of the Treasury committee, said the government needed to “push harder and act faster on the growing fraud epidemic” to give the UK a fighting chance of stopping scammers in their tracks. “For too long, pernicious scammers have acted with impunity, ripping off innocent consumers with fraudulent online adverts, impersonation scams and dodgy crypto investments,” he said. “Unfortunately, fraud has soared during the pandemic, and as MPs we’ve heard heart-breaking stories of individuals who have fallen victim to these criminals and lost large sums of money.” A spokesperson for the government said it was bringing forward investment of £400m over the next three years to tackle economic crime. “We are taking firm and coordinated action across government to crack down on economic crime, and are determined to go further. We will not tolerate criminals profiting on dirty money and will do whatever is necessary to bring these criminals to justice.”",Lifestyle/Money,Government faces urgent call to tackle Britain’s ‘fraud epidemic’,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/02/government-faces-urgent-call-to-tackle-britains-epidemic
2/2/2022,"The Covid pandemic has “destroyed morale” among school leaders in England, who feel they have been scapegoated for government failures during the crisis instead of being hailed as heroes for their role on the frontline, MPs will be told. School leaders will tell a parliamentary briefing on Wednesday that a pay freeze, soaring workload and a mental health and wellbeing crisis are acting as deterrents to the next generation of headteachers.  Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), who will lead the briefing, said the school leadership supply is already teetering on the brink of collapse and warned of an exodus from the senior ranks of the profession once the crisis is over. “It has been a stressful and difficult time for school leaders,” he said. “We are hearing that morale is very low and some are considering leaving the profession. Even before the pandemic there were significant existing challenges like heavy workload, the high-stakes nature of the job and a decade of salaries falling in real terms. “But this has been exacerbated hugely by the lack of trust and support for leaders shown by the government during the pandemic. Experienced teachers and leaders with decades of classroom and management experience do not view headship as an attractive, viable and sustainable career choice.” Diana Ohene-Darko, assistant headteacher and acting deputy headteacher at two London primary schools, is one of those who would be expected at this stage in her career to be considering a step up to a headship role. “Until recently, I would have confidently called myself an ‘aspiring head’, one who wanted to make a difference more widely for the benefit of pupils, staff and the wider community, to take on that role of responsibility and accountability in leadership. However, in this regard, I now have to reflect,” she said. “A decade-long, real-terms pay freeze, along with headteachers becoming scapegoats for government failures during the pandemic, has meant that school leaders are thinking twice about progressing all the way to headship – never mind staying in the profession at all – not least because when all is said and done, it is their head on the line.” Ohene-Darko continued: “Throughout the pandemic, vocational commitment has been tested to breaking point. Workload has soared to the point that our leaders are suffering with their own physical and mental wellbeing; many have had to seek wider support and there is no shame in that. “It is time that our profession was given back the credibility it deserves, in line with other countries who have education on a pedestal. It is time that we were paid in line with inflation, year on year, to reflect the continued and sustained hard work of our profession.” A recent NAHT survey found that more than half (53%) of school leaders who are not yet headteachers do not aspire to headship, up from 40% in 2016. Almost nine in 10 assistant and deputy heads (87%) said concerns about personal wellbeing were a deterrent to become a head and 93% accused the government of failing to support their wellbeing during the pandemic. A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We have taken a wide range of action to support leaders and ensure teacher development remains attractive and fulfilling. This includes a mental health support scheme for school leaders, investing £250m in training opportunities, and committing to help reduce workload in the Education Staff Wellbeing Charter.”",News/Education,"We are ‘scapegoats’ for government failures, say headteachers",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/02/we-are-scapegoats-for-government-failures-say-headteachers
2/2/2022,"Shop price inflation almost doubled in January to the highest level for nearly a decade as the cost of furniture and flooring shot up. Annual inflation of goods bought from retailers rose to 1.5% last month from 0.8% in December, according to the latest data from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) trade body and the market research company NielsenIQ, the highest level since December 2012.  The price of food rose by 2.7% in January, up from 2.4% in the previous month and the highest rate since October 2013. However, the biggest change in inflation was in non-food items, with prices rising by 0.9% compared with 0.2% a month before. Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the BRC, said: “January saw shop price inflation nearly double, driven by a sharp rise in non-food inflation. In particular, furniture and flooring saw exceptionally high demand leading to increased prices as the rising oil costs made shipping more expensive. “Food prices continue to rise, especially domestic produce which have been impacted by poor harvests, labour shortages, and rising global food prices.” The retail price of UK furniture was up by a record 12.5% on a year before in December according to the Office for National Statistics, in the fourth consecutive month of double-digit price rises. A rise in the cost of materials, such as wood, and fuel has combined with a an increase in shipping and labour costs, which have affected many types of manufacturers and retailers. Raw materials and shipping costs have also pumped up the prices of flooring, including carpets. Dickinson warned of further price rises, on top of higher household bills, such as gas and electricity. “Many households will find it difficult to absorb the additional costs, as well as others on the horizon. Retailers are working hard to cut costs, but it would be impossible to protect consumers from any future rises. As commodity prices, energy prices and transportation costs continue to rise, it is inevitable that retail prices will continue to follow in the future,” she said. The latest evidence on inflation comes after data showing that households’ annual grocery bills are on track to rise by £180 this year. Grocery prices rose 3.8% over the four weeks to 23 January compared with the same period last year, according to the market research company Kantar. It said prices are rising fastest for fresh beef and poultry, savoury snacks, crisps, skincare and cat food but are falling for fresh bacon, vitamins and beer.",News/Business,UK shop price inflation almost doubles in January,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/02/uk-shop-price-inflation-almost-doubles-in-january
2/2/2022,"Inside the hallowed halls of State Library Victoria, a very special and scrappy little book is currently on display: Portnoy’s Complaint, the only book ever written by one “Phillip Roth”. This battered, stained edition of the infamously filthy novel, with Roth’s first name misspelled with two Ls on the cover, is enormously significant: one of three known surviving copies of an illegal edition printed in Australia when the book was banned across the country.  Portnoy’s story in Australia is well told: the novel was published in 1969 to great fanfare overseas, but it was deemed obscene and imports were banned at the border by John Gorton’s government. The publisher, Penguin, attempted to circumvent the ban by printing 75,000 copies locally in 1970, before facing down legal battles across the country. After more than a year of prosecutions of defiant booksellers and publishers, and two trials in New South Wales that both ended with hung juries, the censorship of Portnoy’s Complaint was finally lifted in June 1971, marking the end of book bans in Australia. “The case really did challenge Australia’s censorship laws because this wasn’t some pulp book; this was a novel by a well-known American literary author who won awards,” says Des Cowley, principal librarian at SLV and co-curator of the World of the Book 2022 exhibition, in which the bootleg Roth is now displayed. “Readers would have felt affronted that they could not read his book in Australia.” But in early 1970, during the ban, a few hundred copies of a samizdat edition of Portnoy’s Complaint were secretly printed in Melbourne. Cowley had heard rumours of it, but had never seen a copy until 2018 when a regular donor, Andrew Richards, revealed to Cowley that he had one. His copy is the one now on display. “As soon as I saw it, I knew this was clearly the book I had long heard about. And it lived up to my expectations, in that it was so clearly handmade,” Cowley says. “We’re not talking printers and binders, we’re literally talking about people secretly working to print hundreds of copies of a banned book, which would have been completely illegal.” Richards’ copy had come to him via an old friend: Mietta O’Donnell, the late, well-known Melbourne restauranteur. In 1970, when she was 20, O’Donnell handed her copy to Richards; she didn’t want to be caught with it as she was working as a staffer for a federal MP at the time. “I remember Mietta rocking up with this book and being worried that she shouldn’t have it, as it was illegal. It was being handed around by various people – of course I read it! I enjoyed Roth, but especially because it was banned, you know? So she gave it to me and I put it on the shelf and didn’t think much of it,” says Richards, a former solicitor. “I found it while doing a spring clean.” Then in 2020, another copy turned up: this time handed over to the SLV by a donor who was involved in its production. He told Cowley the books had been photocopied and stapled together in the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) headquarters in Carlton. “His memories are a little hazy, but he believes around 300 copies were made in this way, completely by hand,” Cowley says. “Then clearly read and read to death, because so few have survived.” “It is fantastic artifact,” says Anna Welch, senior librarian at the SLV. “You can see how many hands that’s been in, it must have been passed around a million sharehouses. It’s extraordinary that we found a second – sometimes it never rains but it pours.” Only three copies are known to have survived; two are at SLV and one is in the National Library of Australia. (Listed in the catalogue as being by “Phillip [sic] Roth”.) Cowley is unsure how many more might be out there: “When the book was officially made available, I guess many people would have then discarded something like this. So the story would have been lost. “There’s been a lot written about the whole saga with Penguin and the legal case, but a little part of that story is that a small group of people got together and defended the right of literature to exist. It is such a beautiful case because, in a way, it ushers in the change Australia saw between the 1960s and 70s, with the progressive Whitlam government, and going from a literary backwater to a world stage.” Other rarities in the SLV’s World of the Book exhibition include a Cuneiform tablet carved in southern Mesopotamia in 2050BCE; a selection of medieval marginalia – the art of decorating and illustrating the margins; a pristine copy of John James Audobon’s Birds of America, one of the most expensive books in the world; and a pirated US edition of James Joyce’s Ulysses, another famously banned book that celebrates its 100th birthday this year. Among all those beautifully preserved manuscripts and first editions in the exhibition, Cowley describes the Roth as being “the little, cheap goblet hidden among all the glittering cups when looking for the holy grail”. “We’ve done no conservation or anything to it because it’s purely an artefact,” he says. “With all its tears and marks and thumbs of readership, we would not touch or tamper with that in any way; that would detract from its story. And it is a terrific Australian story – one that has never been fully told, as far as I’m aware.” The World of the Book 2022 exhibition is on display in State Library Victoria until 30 June.

2/2/2022,"As Abdullah Fawaz stood over the ball in the 89th minute of the World Cup qualifier between Australia and Oman, it was impossible to ignore the high stakes. His penalty, which he duly deposited beyond Mat Ryan to make it 2-2, were not be enough to keep Oman’s qualification alive, while it placed the Socceroos in a state of existential precariousness. After being held to a draw at the Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex, Australia’s men now sit in third place in Group B with just two games remaining – on the outside looking in at the two slots that carry automatic qualification for Qatar. Heading into the final slate of games next month, Graham Arnold’s side must defeat the top two –Japan and Saudi Arabia – to hold out any hope of directly punching their tickets, while hoping that other results see goal difference fall in their favour.  The only faint positive Arnold can take from the result is that his side now, at the very least, have guaranteed themselves a place in the intercontinental playoff pathway. That will involve a single game against the third-placed side from Group A, likely to be the United Arab Emirates, and then potentially a two-legged playoff against the fifth-placed side from South American qualifying, a slot currently held by Uruguay. For a commentariat not inclined for optimism at the best of times, the result in Muscat and the ensuing scenarios are hardly what Australian football needed. The doomsday scenario of being absent from the world’s biggest sporting event for the first time since 2002 looms. Beyond the heartache of missing out, the increased interest that reaching a World Cup brings has become a critical part of the local game’s model over the past 16 years. Boys and girls who see the Socceroos facing off against the world’s best swells participation numbers and the heightened levels of coverage and awareness from the corporate world boosts Football Australia’s perennially light pockets. The last time football had to confront an absence from the tournament, the game was run by Soccer Australia and its top-flight was the walking corpse of the National Soccer League, the old regime that collapsed soon afterwards. These days, the game is in a significantly healthier state, but the potential ramifications from missing the tournament are unnervingly nebulous and would likely force a significant period of introspection (although that could present a potential silver lining). FA CEO James Johnson, in a rare acknowledgement of the perilous state of the campaign, declared last November that the federation could weather the storm of missed qualification thanks in part to the strength of the Matildas’ brand (which raises the stakes of Tony Gustavsson’s tenure even further given his Asian Cup failure), and the A-Leagues, which in theory are now somewhat insulated against the struggles of the national teams thanks to their newfound independence. Nonetheless, a win against Oman would still have had the game facing down these issues, even if it would have helped soothe some nerves. As in the Vietnam fixture, the Socceroos started brightly in Muscat. Indeed, their first-half might have been their best all-around performance of qualification, as playing Tom Rogic and Jackson Irvine in front of Aaron Mooy in the midfield again paid dividends. Yet a second stanza fadeout again eventuated and, unlike last week’s game , the rub of the green and a pumping home crowd could not favour the Socceroos. Oman, despite missing a number of players to Covid, took advantage of the downturn and drop in incisiveness to twice come from behind and ensure the spoils were shared. For Australia, it was vexing in isolation, but even more so when placed in the broader context of the campaign. Had the Socceroos laid a foundation and built on their play in the opening halves of the past two games, with tweaks to personnel and approach, their position would be far less precarious. Instead, obscured by an 11-game winning streak that in hindsight did not so much paper of the cracks as mummify them, pragmatism and a blunt attacking approach became embedded for much of the qualification campaign – culminating in a home draw against Saudi Arabia and inability to defeat China.

Those who suffer in childhood are also least likely to trust official NHS coronavirus information, follow the rules of restrictions or wear masks during the pandemic, public health experts found.  Two years after the virus first reached the UK and a year after vaccines to protect against it were made available for free on the NHS, millions of people have yet to be vaccinated. Almost one in 10 people in the UK – 9% – have still not had a single dose. Health experts and policymakers are urgently trying to figure out why. Now the findings of a new study funded by Public Health Wales and published in the journal BMJ Open suggests that Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy may be linked to childhood trauma. Researchers surveyed 2,285 people aged 18 and over in Wales during lockdown restrictions between 2020 and 2021. They were asked about nine different adverse childhood experiences (Aces) as well as low trust in NHS Covid-19 information, whether they backed the removal of social distancing and mandatory face coverings, and breaking Covid rules and vaccine hesitancy. Aces include neglect, physical, psychological or sexual mistreatment, and growing up in a household affected by domestic violence, substance or alcohol abuse and other criminal justice problems. Parents separating or divorcing, abandonment, or having a parent with a mental health condition are other examples of Aces. The nine Aces included in the study were: physical, verbal and sexual abuse, parental separation, exposure to domestic violence, living with a household member with mental illness, alcohol and/or drug misuse, or a family member in prison. Half of those in the study had not experienced any childhood trauma, one in five had suffered one type, about one in six reported two or three, and one in 10 reported four or more. The results showed that the more trauma people had experienced in childhood, the more likely they were to mistrust NHS Covid-19 information, to feel unfairly restricted by the government and to support the end of mandatory face masks. People were twice as likely to break Covid rules if they had four or more Aces compared with none, while vaccine hesitancy was threefold higher with more than four Aces compared with none. More than four Aces were also associated with a desire to scrap social distancing. Vaccine hesitancy was estimated at 38% for those aged 18 to 29 with more than four Aces, though older age groups were much more likely to have a vaccination. This was an observational study and could not establish cause. The researchers also acknowledged caveats to their findings, which relied on personal recall. Women were overrepresented, while people from ethnic minority backgrounds were underrepresented. Nevertheless, the researchers pointed out that people who have suffered childhood trauma were “known to have greater health risks across the life-course. Results here suggest such individuals may have more difficulty with compliance with public health control measures and consequently require additional support”. This is important not only for the current pandemic but for other public health emergencies arising in the future, they said. “A better understanding of how to increase their trust in health systems and compliance with health guidance is urgently required. Without consideration of how best to engage such individuals, some risk being effectively excluded from population health interventions, remaining at higher risks of infection and posing a potential transmission risk to others.”",News/Society,"Covid vaccine hesitancy could be linked to childhood trauma, research finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/01/covid-vaccine-hesitancy-could-be-linked-childhood-trauma-research

If you’re after breaking news instead, we have a live blog for that. And if you just want something weird and wonderful, here are some Swedish crows that have been trained to pick up cigarette butts. Now, on to the reads.  From stealing jewellery to make it reappear, to riffling through a grieving mother’s possessions to better impersonate her dead son, M Lamar Keene’s cons are shocking. Then, in 1976, he gave it away in a tell-all book. What happened next? A rival spiritualist tried to assassinate him. “Someone took a shot at him on his lawn but missed,” writes Hollie Richardson, “leaving a bullet in the side of his house.” Notable quote: “People wanting to communicate with the dead is timeless,” says Vicky Baker, who has made a podcast series about Keene’s life. “Today, some psychics refer to themselves as ‘intuitive healers’, which is much more compatible with the wellness industry.” Baker namechecks Gwyneth Paltrow, Kim Kardashian and Drew Barrymore as fans of psychic’s services. “Nowadays, it’s a wellness treat – rather than a dark secret in a dodgy alleyway shop.” How long will it take me to read?

Now, frequent storms and erosion have forced the area into constant flux, with bulldozers working year-round to repair what nature has done. She drove the 238km length of its arterial road to witness the change for herself. Notable quote: “A ferry employee asked me what I was doing,” Mayhew writes. “I shared that I was an environmental journalist. He pulled me inside the ferry to show me a picture of an island that had disappeared under the rising seas. ‘I believe in climate change,’ he told me, quietly, as if he was afraid someone might overhear him. ‘But I’m an ugly American. I don’t like to be told what to do. Ask me nicely to wear a mask or recycle. Then I’ll do just about anything for you.’” How long will it take me to read? Four minutes.

But, honestly, it doesn’t compare to what I was doing in opera ... One video designer I worked with used to call me constantly from 7am to midnight, for a full year.

2/2/2022,"Newly released cabinet documents reveal Australia was preoccupied with the interests of major oil and gas corporations in the Timor Sea years before it bugged the Timor-Leste government during talks to carve up the crucial underwater resources. Independent senator Rex Patrick is currently battling for access to archived cabinet documents detailing Australia’s strategy for bartering over the resource-rich Timor Sea with the then soon-to-be independent state of Timor-Leste.  Australia infamously bugged its ally during the negotiations years later, a scandal exposed after Witness K, an intelligence officer, and his lawyer Bernard Collaery helped Timor-Leste mount a case in the international courts. Patrick is seeking two archived documents, dated 29 August 2000 and 4 September 2000, which would usually have been released after 20 years, like most cabinet records. But, initially at least, the National Archives of Australia suppressed the documents due to the perceived harm they could cause to relations with “the current government of a foreign country”. That prompted Patrick to launch a case in the administrative appeals tribunal, which the NAA resisted, even flagging it would seek to have attorney general Michaelia Cash use extraordinary powers to shroud at least part of the proceedings in secrecy. That changed last week, when the NAA informed Patrick it had decided to release additional parts of the documents to him, prior to any AAT ruling. The documents, still heavily redacted, show cabinet was concerned that Timor-Leste’s independence process may disrupt access to the oil and gas reserves in the Timor Sea, because Australia’s prior agreement with Indonesia for a 50:50 revenue split would be void. Cabinet agreed that it should urgently seek to reach an agreement with the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor to “avoid a discontinuity, and assure continued exploration and exploitation of the petroleum resources of the Timor Gap”. “To avoid a legal vacuum and provide commercial certainty for operators in the Timor Gap, negotiations with UNTAET and East Timorese representatives are needed to reach agreement on a replacement treaty for the Timor Gap, which will enter into force at East Timor’s independence,” the submission read. “Investors will be affected by uncertainties about he legal arrangements that will apply in the Timor Gap after independence. To maintain large-scale investments required for projects that are expected to go into production after 2003, operators require assurances on the rules that will apply. “Without a smooth transition of the legal arrangements for the Timor Gap, there is a risk that investor confidence will fall away and commercial activity cease, with the result that neither Australia nor East Timor will draw revenue from the area.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The submission warned of a potential “political sensitivity”. It said critics believed the existing treaty with Indonesia had “failed to deliver benefits to East Timor” and its people. “All these arguments are contestable but they will undoubtedly re-surface in public discussion of new treaty arrangements,” it said. The bugging operation took place much later, in 2004, after Timor-Leste’s formal independence. Timor-Leste expert professor Clinton Fernandes, who works with the University of New South Wales, has seen the documents obtained by Patrick. Fernandes said Australian officials had misrepresented the attitudes of Timor-Leste’s leaders, who had made it clear repeatedly that their principal interest was in a maritime boundary, not agreeing on revenue shares of oil and gas. But he said Australia had chased a resource-sharing agreement regardless, instead of seeking to negotiate on the maritime border prior to Timor-Leste’s formal independence. “This is a striking departure from Australia’s normal policy of settling permanent maritime borders,” Fernandes said. “As such, it is a public policy failure of scandalous proportions, putting the interests of oil and gas corporations above the national interest.” Patrick said it was “astounding” that it had taken three reviews by the NAA to release more of the material. He accused the government of trying to prevent the “sordid” history of its conduct being disclosed to the public. “Sadly, the taxpayer will bear the cost of the proceedings to date, which includes the charges levied by the Australian Government Solicitor to represent them, and potentially the AAT application fee,” he said. “Failing to play a straight bat and continuing to rely on secrecy damages Australia’s international reputation, credibility and very directly damages Australia’s foreign relations, and not just with Timor-Leste and Indonesia.” The NAA said it could not comment, other than to confirm it had released further information to Patrick. “As this matter remains before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, National Archives cannot comment on the costs, or the reasoning for releasing further information,” a spokesperson said.",News/Australia news,Cabinet documents reveal Australia’s interest in oil and gas before Timor-Leste bugging,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/02/cabinet-documents-reveal-australias-interest-in-oil-and-gas-before-timor-leste-bugging
