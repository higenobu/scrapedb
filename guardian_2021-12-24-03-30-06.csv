12/24/2021,"Virginia Woolf pinned it to “on or about” December 1910: the date at which human nature changed. “All human relations have shifted,” she wrote. “And when human relations change there is at the same time a change in religion, conduct, politics, and literature.” With less hyperbole, we might suggest that it was in the late 1950s that Black America transformed – not just with the civil rights movement, but across the whole spectrum of creativity and conduct. Aspects of this revolution have been well documented: the Birth of the Cool in jazz; the writers Ralph Ellison, James Baldwin, Richard Wright. But some of the most quotidian parts have gone underexamined. Such as clothes. Look at photos of Black American men in the 1950s and 1960s and what stands out is a coherence and growing confidence in their appearance. Here is the saxophonist John Coltrane in a soft-shouldered jacket and knitted tie, while over here is the writer Amiri Baraka in a button-down shirt and a shawl-collar cardigan. The look is smart, yet relaxed – no heavily padded suits or repp striped ties here. As the varsity jackets and penny loafers suggest, it is a style inspired by privileged white students at Ivy League colleges. You might even say it has been appropriated – and then bettered. The colour palette widens, the finishing touches are bolder: tie clips, collar pins, capped brogues. Later, this look will become known as Black Ivy.  This insurgency is documented and celebrated in a new book called Black Ivy: A Revolt in Style. In his introduction, Jason Jules describes the look as “a kind of battledress, a symbolic armour worn in the nonviolent pursuit of fundamental change. Making society treat them differently meant making the mainstream see them differently first.” Think of the tenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins in a button-down shirt playing Freedom Suite, or Billy Taylor in a tweed jacket composing I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel To Be Free. The goal wasn’t merely to join the elite, it was to redefine it. However subtly done, the style was a challenge to authority. Dressing like a university student wasn’t an affectation, but a crucial part of the struggles around desegregating America’s education system. After the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, the political mood changed – and so did street style. Stokely Carmichael went from working alongside John Lewis in sports jackets and ties to leading the Black Panthers in dark glasses and a black leather jacket, clutching a rifle. While the term “gesture politics” is always intended as an insult, we are right now rewriting what counts as a political gesture: just consider the rows both here and in the US over the taking of the knee. Historians have long argued that enslaved people and indentured labourers showed resistance by dragging their feet or feigning incomprehension of barked orders. Something similar needs to happen with fashion, which is too often discussed as either catwalk creations or what’s in the January sales. Yet it can also be about expressing one’s self-image and beliefs. Black Ivy was about young Black Americans changing how they saw themselves – starting with the mirror by the wardrobe.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on fashion in politics: how to rewrite the style guide | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/23/the-guardian-view-on-fashion-in-politics-how-to-rewrite-the-style-guide
12/24/2021,"The chair of West Suffolk hospital trust has resigned over a whistleblowing scandal exposed by the Guardian, as fresh questions are asked over why the trust continues to pay at least £270,000 a year to its former chief executive. Sheila Childerhouse was criticised by an independent NHS report for her failure to question senior executives who had hounded Dr Patricia Mills after Mills had raised concerns about a colleague seen injecting himself with drugs while on duty.  Childerhouse has announced that she will step down in January after consultants at the Bury St Edmunds hospital told her last week that her position was “untenable”. The NHS report, by Christine Outram, found that Childerhouse failed to take up Mills’ concerns when she was sent a “confidential” email in 2018 expressing alarm that the self-injecting doctor was being allowed to continue to treat patients. When the email was passed to the chief executive, Steve Dunn, Mills was accused of trouble-making, libelling the doctor and trying to undermine the hospital’s medical director, Nick Jenkins. In the report Childerhouse was also criticised for failing to question the “extremely ill-judged” decision by executives to demand fingerprint samples from Mills and others as part of a hunt for an anonymous letter writer who alerted a grieving family to a potentially botched operation. In her resignation statement, Childerhouse said: “I recognise and take personal accountability for the failings identified in the independent review into whistleblowing, and believe it is in the best interests of the organisation, our staff, patients and community that I do.” It is understood that Childerhouse had wanted to retain Dunn, described by the former health secretary Matt Hancock as a “brilliant leader”, as chief executive. She accepted Dunn had to go only in June, when two newly appointed non-executive directors resigned over the issue. Dunn was also roundly criticised in the report. As part of his leaving deal, the trust agreed to continue to pay Dunn’s salary and perks, between £270,000 and £275,000 last year, according to the trust’s accounts, while he was on secondment to the Nuffield trust thinktank. Mills said doctors were alarmed to discover the terms of the deal. She said: “We were all really surprised to find out that Steve Dunn is in fact still employed by West Suffolk and will be until September 2022. That fact was opaque in the communication that came out when he left in July.” Separately, the trust has disclosed to Mills, under freedom of information rules, that it paid a private company, Vista Investigations, £57,388 to investigate her conduct during the affair, including £3,015 in hotel bills for the investigator. The cost of a previous external investigation into her has yet to be disclosed. Outram said the investigatory process against Mills lacked “fairness, balance and compassion”. A spokesperson for the Nuffield trust said Dunn “has accepted the failings and shortcomings around the handling of events leading up to and surrounding the whistleblowing”. Dr Jenny Vaughan, chair of the Doctors’ Association UK, said: “What is deeply concerning to us is why lead members of the executive, who were responsible, are still on the trust payroll on apparently the same terms.” She backed Mills’ calls for the managers involved to be held to account: “Without hounding people, in the way Dr Mills was treated by them, there must be accountability by management for this debacle. Saying that they ‘accept the failings and shortcomings’ in no way makes up for the damage done. Continuing to take a full pay packet while clinging to their position after such a devastating report speaks volumes about the seriousness with which these findings are being taken.” A source at the trust confirmed that Dunn was “working out the remainder of his employment, which includes his contractual notice period, at the Nuffield trust”.",News/Society,West Suffolk hospital chair resigns after whistleblowing scandal,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/23/west-suffolk-hospital-chair-resigns-after-whistleblowing-scandal
12/24/2021,"Joe Root feels ready to “bang out” a seventh Test hundred in 2021 and has tipped England’s angry batting inquest to spark a wider response on Boxing Day. A rejigged lineup that is expected to see Zak Crawley replace Rory Burns at opener heads into the must-win third Ashes under instructions to get ruthless. It follows the decision by the head coach, Chris Silverwood, to make his players rewatch their dismissals from the 275-run defeat in Adelaide together.  Even Root, sitting only 158 runs away from Mohammad Yousuf’s Test record of 1,788 in a calendar year, has revisited his approach. On Thursday he batted with a fourth stump behind him in the MCG nets, having put his failure to turn his eighth half-century in Australia into three figures down to a lack of discipline outside off. Speaking before the third Test of five, with his team 2-0 down, Root said: “I’m confident I can bang out a hundred in these conditions. I feel in a really good place with my batting. I know that’s a brave thing to say but that conversion rate, this year, it’s not been an issue at all. I just need to put myself in those positions, have the bit between my teeth, [and think]: ‘Over my dead body.’” Asked whether, as a captain who is usually soft-spoken, it felt easy to dispense some harsh words to the underperforming batting unit, Root replied: “It did at the end of the last game because of the situation we’re in and the manner in which we lost. “I’ll always try to look at things with a level, pragmatic approach but I don’t think you could after the way we’ve played those last two games. I expect a response from everyone this week. “There’s no motivation needed, really. Just the state of the series, what’s at stake and what we need to do, quite simply. I would like to bring a nice Christmas present home for everyone who stays up [to watch on TV back in the UK]. We are doing everything we can to make sure it is 2-1 by the time we leave here.” Despite a personally golden year with the bat, Root has recently been replaced as No 1 in the Test batting rankings by Australia’s Marnus Labuschagne, a batsman held up as the template for the bloody-minded approach required in Australia. “I’ve never been one for [the rankings] but it would be nice to have it back for Christmas,” said Root. When asked if his captaincy is on the line this week, Root replied: “I’ll worry about that at the end of the series, all I can control is the next game. Those decisions are above my head but I’ll make sure from a team point of view we’ll show a lot more this time.”",Sport/Sport,Joe Root confident he can ‘bang out’ a hundred as England look to hit back,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/23/joe-root-confident-he-can-bang-out-hundred-england-look-to-hit-back-ashes-third-test-melbourne
12/24/2021,"Boxing Day at the MCG is one of Australia’s most iconic days of sport and for the first time in 10 years, through a quirk of the schedule rather than England’s fortunes, its Ashes Test remains a live contest. Just. In 2010 the tourists were a confident, well-drilled side under Andrew Strauss hunting retention of the urn, a mission they completed handsomely. By contrast, their modern equivalents will walk out on in front of 70,000 spectators needing to prove the lessons they always speak of after defeat have been learned.  These in part revolve around a discipline outside off stump, the lack of which afflicted Australia back then. When bowled out for 98 by Jimmy Anderson, Tim Bresnan and Chris Tremlett, all 10 wickets were caught between wicketkeeper and gully. Melbourne’s mighty coliseum was practically deserted by the time England reached 157 for no loss by stumps. Expecting a repeat this year requires the optimism of Dr Pangloss but Joe Root’s men, fresh from the dressing room lock-in staged by their head coach, Chris Silverwood, after their slump to 2-0, can really only improve. Nearly every decision taken so far has backfired, be it selection or strategy, while non-negotiables such as catching or no-balls have been costly. For Root, these have exacerbated the situation. “There was a lot of frustration [after Adelaide],” said Root. “Purely because of the basic mistakes that we’ve been making. And we’ve done it twice in a row. And, as I said to the group, I don’t think they’re that much better than us in these conditions. “The scoreline would suggest they’re absolutely a far better team than us and I don’t think they are. If we perform anywhere like we can, we’ll put them in an uncomfortable position and find ourselves in a very different situation leaving this ground.” Which players can achieve this was still up in the air three days out from the toss. The expectation is that Zak Crawley will resume his Test career, a call based on a belief that the 6ft 5in right-hander will be suited to Australian conditions rather than any tangible form on a tour without state games. Rory Burns, whose first-ball dismissal in Brisbane was war-gamed by the coaching staff before the series yet still proved defining, may make way. If Haseeb Hameed is backed over Burns as expected, despite little more by way of output from the top of the order, it may be a reflection of the approach espoused during the truth session rather than a sign of looking to the future. After all, another late call comes at No 6, a choice between a struggling star of the future in Ollie Pope and Jonny Bairstow, who would boomerang back for a 79th Test cap. Then there is the seam attack, publicly criticised by Root for not bowling full enough in Adelaide. It was a move which led Ricky Ponting to question the captain’s authority and, more recently, Steve Harmison to claim he would be “waiting at the top of the stairs” had Michael Vaughan said the same back in the day. England (possible) Zak Crawley, Haseeb Hameed, Dawid Malan, Joe Root (c), Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler (wk), Ollie Robinson, Mark Wood, Jack Leach, Jimmy Anderson Australia (probable) David Warner, Marcus Harris, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Cameron Green, Alex Carey, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Jhye Richardson, Nathan Lyon Third Test, Boxing Day to 30 December, Melbourne Cricket Ground Given time to reflect, Root tried to explain he simply wanted bowled and lbw to be in the equation a touch more often. And not least against Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith, two insatiable batting tragics who happily leave all day and do so with a flourish which, however ridiculous it looks, makes this a win for them rather than a stalemate. “I think what I was trying to say was as soon as we [went full to Labuschagne and Smith], we showed how dangerous we could be and how many problems we caused them,” said Root. “And we know those two players in particular, [if you] dismiss them for not many runs it will cause all sorts of panic. We saw it this time last year when Australia lost to India, it has a massive effect on the rest of the batting group.” A moribund drop-in pitch at the MCG has been the source of much local angst in recent times, with the Ashes Test here four years ago, when Alastair Cook ground out an unbeaten 244 in a match of just 24 wickets, arguably the nadir. So much so, in fact, a half-decent surface for a Sheffield Shield match earlier this season even became front page news in the Melbourne newspaper the Age. India’s dominant victory 12 months ago makes for an interesting pointer, however, with the dual spin of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja claiming eight of the 20 Australian wickets to fall. It may be, that along with the pace of Mark Wood, Jack Leach returns to England’s attack. Along with Chris Woakes, which out of Anderson or Stuart Broad makes way may hint at who shared Harmison’s view. Australia meanwhile welcome back Pat Cummins as captain after the elite honesty that followed his close contact with a positive Covid case, while the struggling opener Marcus Harris has been backed for one more chance by Justin Langer. Despite a surprise triumph in the T20 World Cup, Australia’s head coach began this series under pressure for his position after a year of grumbling from inside the dressing room about an apparently suffocating style. Yet on Thursday, Langer was speaking openly about his desire to secure a contract renewal next year. Instead it his English equivalent, Silverwood, who goes into Boxing Day needing his methods to translate into immediate results.",Sport/Sport,England put recriminations aside and spy chance to put Australia in a ‘panic’ | Ali Martin,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/23/england-put-recriminations-aside-and-spy-chance-to-put-australia-in-a-panic
12/24/2021,"British construction company Balfour Beatty will pay $65m (£49m) in fines after pleading guilty to fraud committed against the US military. The company’s US arm was one of the biggest providers of privatised military housing to the US army, navy and air forces at 55 bases across the states of Georgia, Oklahoma and Texas, but it lied about repairs in order to increase bonus payments, the US Department of Justice said on Thursday.  The company, a member of the FTSE 250 index of mid-sized companies, had to meet various maintenance and resident satisfaction targets to qualify for the bonuses. But employees deliberately altered data in its property management software and falsified resident comment cards to reach the required levels. The payout includes a $34m penalty plus nearly $32m in restitution, and the company will also be supervised for three years by an independent compliance monitor. It is not the first time that Balfour Beatty has been censured for defence-related work. In the UK in 2019 MI6 sacked the company as a contractor during refurbishment work after it lost sensitive plans of the layout of its headquarters in London’s Vauxhall, which are famously featured in several James Bond spy films. The deputy head of the FBI, which was also involved in the recent fraud inquiry, said it was a “disgraceful” crime. Two former Balfour Beatty managers, Stacy Cabrera and Rick Cunefare, have already pleaded guilty to fraud charges related to the case this year. The fines are more than Balfour Beatty’s entire profit before tax for 2020 of £48m, although they are only a small proportion of revenues of £8.6bn during that year. The company, valued at £1.6bn, is struggling with other problems in its main UK building business, which counts Hinkley Point nuclear power station and the HS2 and Crossrail rail developments among its major projects. The chief executive, Leo Quinn, who was paid £2.1m in salary and bonuses in 2020, warned in August that the company would not take on any new property construction projects in central London after it was forced to prop up failing subcontractors. The US deputy attorney general, Lisa Monaco, said: “Instead of promptly repairing housing for US service members as required, Balfour Beatty lied about the repairs to pocket millions of dollars in performance bonuses. “This pervasive fraud was a consequence of Balfour Beatty’s broken corporate culture, which valued profit over the welfare of service members.” The fraud meant that crucial maintenance was delayed, harming military personnel and their families, the Department of Justice said. Balfour Beatty said it had appointed a chief compliance officer for the US after carrying out a review when the fraud was first discovered, as well as adding further ethics and compliance training for all employees. “The wrongdoing that took place is completely contrary to the way the company expects its people to behave,” Balfour Beatty said in a statement to the stock market on Thursday. “The company apologises for the actions of communities to all its stakeholders. It has been made clear to all employees that breaches of policies, procedures, or law will not be tolerated.”",News/Business,Balfour Beatty to pay £49m fine for fraud against US military,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/23/balfour-beatty-to-pay-49m-fine-for-against-us-military
12/24/2021,"A fan-led attempt to return Bury FC to life has taken a great step forward after the government pledged £1m towards a bid to buy back Gigg Lane. The funding, announced as part of the Community Ownership Fund run by the Department for Levelling Up, will be matched against money raised by a consortium of bidders led by two supporters’ groups and the US-based benefactor Peter Alexander. Sources close to the deal say they hope it will now be completed imminently.  The purchase of Gigg Lane would herald the possibility of Bury returning to competition at the start of the 2022-23 season, three years after the club went into liquidation. It would also see the stadium transformed into a community hub with an all-weather pitch and gym installed for public use and the redevelopment of the Manchester Road stand to accommodate NHS services. Matthew Pickup of the Est 1885 supporter group, which has helped drive the proposed deal, said a return to Gigg Lane was “agonisingly close”. “This funding will allow us the opportunity to complete the purchase of Gigg Lane in order to bring football back to its historic home after a nearly three-year hiatus,” he said. “There are still a few steps left in the process and we hope to provide a further update in the coming days when the legalities have been completed but we thank all the fans for their continued support.” Michael Gove, the secretary of state for levelling up said: “The collapse of Bury FC is a stain on English football and the result of the game being ripped out of the hands of the supporters and communities who made it what it is by big business and corporate interest. “I pay enormous tribute to Bury’s supporters, who have shown incredible resolve in their fight to bring their beloved club back to life. By helping rescue the historic Gigg Lane stadium, we are helping to put power back into their hands and securing a cherished asset for the wider community.” Further negotiations over the bid will now take place between the bidders and Bury council, which has committed to contributing funds to the deal. Tamoor Tariq, the deputy leader of Bury council said: “This is an important day but we need to renew our efforts to get over the line.” If a deal is done an application must then be submitted to the Football Association for a return to competition, and a specific division agreed for the club to compete in. After that, Bury FC will finally be able to complete its return from the ashes.",Sport/Football,Government pledge £1m to help Bury fans to buy back Gigg Lane,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/23/government-pledge-1m-to-help-bury-fans-to-buy-back-gigg-lane
12/24/2021,"Dorothy Wordsworth’s rare achievement as the other great writer in the Wordsworth family and an early environmentalist (Editorial, 19 December) is the focus of a year-long celebration of her life in the town where she was born on Christmas Day 250 years ago – Cockermouth in Cumbria. The centrepiece of the project, supported by our local councils, the National Lottery Heritage Fund and others, is a unique Portrait of Dorothy light installation artwork that this year is part of the town’s much loved Christmas lights. Commissioned by the local charity that I chair, Kirkgate Arts and Heritage, from the Cumbrian arts practice ArtFly, the “statue in light” stands on a temporary plinth woven from Cumbrian willow and hazel.  Our town is not only known for its associations with Dorothy’s brother William but also with the scientist John Dalton, the mutineer Fletcher Christian and a colonial viceroy of India, Lord Mayo, whose huge statue has dominated our Main Street since 1875 following his assassination. Standing alongside Mayo, albeit more modestly and temporarily, Dorothy’s portrait is a reminder of her talent and her values, which resonate so strongly in our own times. She remains an inspiration for overlooked women everywhere.Marion BowmanChair, Kirkgate Arts and Heritage  I would recommend two books by the poet-scholar Lucy Newlyn, who was mentioned in your editorial: William & Dorothy Wordsworth: “All in Each Other” (2013) and Vital Stream (2019); they are more than perfect Christmas presents. In the earlier book, Newlyn invokes Marcel Mauss’s observations “that bonds are created through gifts, in a mutual interdependence of giver and receiver”. In Vital Stream, Newlyn gives us 135 sonnets covering the lives of William Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy through the spring and summer of 1802. In his introduction to Vital Stream, Richard Holmes quite rightly argues that Newlyn’s extraordinary sonnets should be read out on the radio. What about on TV, in Grasmere? That really would be something!Bruce Ross-SmithOxford  In the British Library there is a copy of AS Cottle’s The Edda of Saemund (1797). It is bound in a beautiful green fabric, with white horses, like the one at Uffington, dancing about. I wish someone would reproduce it. It is said to be made from a piece of one of Mrs Wordsworth’s old gowns. The English poet Robert Southey mentions the “good lady’s bookbinding propensities”. I wonder if the gown had been Dorothy’s rather than Mary Wordsworth’s, who seems to have dressed in a rather more sombre fashion.Eyke ShannonWestleton, Suffolk  Your editorial refers to Lucy Newlyn’s argument that Dorothy and William were “equal partners in writing”. If, according to legend, and as depicted in the 2000 film Pandaemonium, William’s “I wandered lonely as a cow” was redrafted as “cloud” at Dorothy’s behest, hers may have been the defining spirit of Wordsworth.Austen LynchGarstang, Lancashire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

12/24/2021,"At my grammar school in the 1960s, girls took domestic science while boys studied civics/local history (Letters, 17 December). DS lessons began with the making and embroidering of a gingham apron; for the practical lessons, we were bussed to the kitchens of a secondary modern school 15 miles away as our grammar school did not have a DS “laboratory”. The boys used to eat our lemon meringue pies on the bus during the return journey to school. One report of mine read: “Her results are fair but she shows little enthusiasm for washing up and cleaning sinks.” I failed to earn my washing-up badge at Brownies, not surprisingly. At university in the late 60s (where I studied politics/sociology), a frequent chat-up line from male students (who had had no DS lessons) was “show me how to boil an egg/fry bacon”. In my first job in the 70s as a teacher of politics and sociology at a comprehensive, there was a “school flat” with a kitchen. The girls had to clean and serve a weekly meal to the headteacher and staff. One male colleague regularly slept in the flat as he lived miles away from the school – he was often spotted by amused students having breakfast in a nearby cafe.  I recall seeing a question on a GCE exam paper at the time that clearly saw DS as a female activity: “Your brother arrives home late after a school football match. Describe how you would wash, launder and iron his PE kit ready for the next day, taking into account that some items were muddy and torn.” By the 90s, when my sons were in secondary education, “food technology” had replaced cookery and domestic science and, thanks to equality legislation, all students studied the subject. Instead of washing up, students had to produce a design folder showing every stage involved in making a pizza. My sons probably learned more from Ready Steady Cook on TV than from these lessons, but they are both excellent cooks today (they can wash up as well).Stephanie GarrettWelwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

12/24/2021,"Vladimir Putin has deployed his troops to the border with Ukraine, delivered impossible demands on Europe and appears ready to launch a new offensive to establish his domination over Kyiv. Putin is said to feel a “historical mission” to reverse Ukraine’s drift towards the west, despite his own role in creating a rift by annexing Crimea and fuelling a war in Ukraine’s south-east. But his current fast pace raises questions of why he appears to feel the moment to act is now, as if he is running out of time.  From Putin’s perspective, he may look to recent events in Ukraine and believe it’s all downhill from here. His attempt to force Ukraine to reintegrate the eastern Donbas region, a poison pill that could give him a veto over the country’s geopolitical path, has failed as the Minsk agreements that would have steered it come close to collapse. His proxies may control a sliver of Ukraine’s south-east but the rest of the country has drifted further from his control. At the same time, Putin is alarmed by growing military cooperation between Ukraine and the west, including military assistance and prospective arms sales from the UK, joint military drills with Nato countries, deliveries of US Javelin anti-tank missiles, and purchases of Turkish drones. He argues that the country is de facto becoming an “unofficial” member of Nato, an “anti-Russia” that he claims could one day host western troops or even missiles. “They came to the conclusion that trends weren’t heading in their direction, that they were heading toward geopolitical defeat,” said Samuel Charap, a senior political scientist at the Rand Corporation. The Kremlin’s early plan of “waiting it out”, for Ukrainians to lose patience with their new government and for the west to lose interest in Ukraine, was no longer viable. The Kremlin “decided that the status quo was intolerable and it needed to be changed”. To do that, Putin has said he is open to negotiations and has demanded a new treaty with Nato to roll back its expansion by removing troops and infrastructure from countries that joined after 1997, a non-starter in much of eastern Europe. At the same time, Putin has made it clear he is impatient to obtain his “security guarantees” immediately and has treated his potential negotiating partners with open disdain. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine, who ran for office on a peace platform, has come “under the influence of radical elements,” Putin said on Thursday. Negotiations with his government have basically ceased. Last month Russian diplomats leaked their communications with their French and German counterparts, essentially scuttling chances for further negotiations with European powers. That leaves Joe Biden, a politician whom Putin may grant more respect but has made clear he does not trust. Even his promises, Putin says, may as well be written in sand. “You and I know well that even they, legal guarantees, cannot be trusted because the United States easily withdraws from all international agreements it loses interest in for one reason or another while explaining it somehow or giving no explanations whatsoever,” he told his top commanders on Tuesday. That leaves Putin the option of military force, a contingency that he appears ready to use. The Russian president appears consumed with the Ukraine question – this summer he published a 6,000-word essay on the topic under his own name – and Russian analysts have proposed that solving his dilemma could determine his own timeline as Russia’s leader. “It appears that what he manages to achieve in Ukraine will be the deciding factor in whether or not Putin stays on after 2024,” wrote Alexander Baunov, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, this month. While it is difficult to imagine Putin stepping down after 24 years in power, it is also possible that his desire to regain Ukraine as a “brotherly” nation could be one factor compelling him to stay on into the future. “If victory hasn’t yet been achieved, perhaps it’s not the time to step down,” wrote Baunov.",News/World news,Why Putin is acting like a man who has run out of time,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/vladimir-putin-russian-president-ukraine-analysis
12/24/2021,"More than 800 faith leaders have called on the Biden administration and Senate Democrats to pass voting rights legislation next year. “We cannot be clearer, you must act now to protect every American’s freedom to vote without interference and with confidence that their ballot will be counted and honored. Passing comprehensive voting rights legislation must be the number-one priority of the administration and Congress,” faith leaders said in a letter addressed to the president and Senate members on Wednesday.  The letter, organized by Martin Luther King III and his wife, Arndrea Waters King, was signed by various faith organizations, including the African American Christian Clergy Coalition, Bend the Arc: Jewish Action and Faith in Public Life. Signatories include those who come from Muslim, Christian and Jewish communities, including Reverend Canon Leonard L Hamlin Sr of the Washington National Cathedral and Rabbi Danya Ruttenberg of National Council of Jewish Women. “The communities we represent will continue to sound the alarm until these bills are passed. While we come from different faiths, we are united by our commitment to act in solidarity with the most vulnerable among us,” the letter added. The letter comes after Republicans successfully filibustered voting rights bills on four different occasions this year. Most recently, on 3 November, Republicans in the Senate blocked the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Acts – one of two major pieces of voting rights legislation that Democrats have championed in Congress in attempts to prevent Republicans from eroding easy access to the vote. Republicans blocking the key voting rights bill in November was a move seen by many as a breaking point in the push to eliminate the filibuster, the Senate rule that requires 60 votes to advance most legislation. Despite numerous Democrats calling for the elimination of the filibuster, they lack the votes to end the rule due to not only a slim majority but also opposition within their own party. Two Democrats, Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, are strongly opposed, arguing that the rule forges bipartisan compromise. Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, described the filibuster on 3 November as a “low, low point in the history of this body”. In Wednesday’s letter, faith leaders said, “Nothing – including the filibuster – should stand in the way of passing the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, both of which have already passed the House and await Senate action and leadership.” According to a tally by the Brennan Center for Justice, nineteen states have enacted nearly three dozen laws between January and the end of September that make it more difficult to vote. Wednesday’s letter is a reflection of the growing pressure on Democrats to pass voting rights legislation that aims to outlaw excessive partisan gerrymandering and would require early voting, no-excuse mail-in voting, in addition to automatic and same-day registration. “It’s time to stop lamenting the state of our democracy and take action to address it,” the letter said.",News/US news,‘It’s time to take action’: faith leaders urge Biden to pass voting rights legislation,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/23/biden-administration-voting-rights-legislation
12/24/2021,"Pep Guardiola has raised the prospect of strike action and Rafael Benítez has claimed “money is now managing the game” as anger grows among Premier League managers over players welfare. The Premier League rejected Everton’s request to postpone their Boxing Day game at Burnley owing to five positive Covid cases and six injuries in Benitez’s squad. The Everton manager believes his club are being punished for not closing their training ground and that the league’s integrity – as well as its profitability as a sellable, televised product – could be damaged by fulfilling fixtures with academy players.  Guardiola has gone further, suggesting more direct action may be required for the game’s authorities to heed concerns over the demands placed on players. Manchester City’s manager said: “Should the players and the managers be all together and make a strike? Just through words it’s not going to be solved. For Fifa, the Premier League, the broadcasters, the business is more important than their welfare. The simplest example is all around the world they have five substitutions; here it’s still three. Tell me one argument to take care of players’ welfare than this one? Here, where everyone decides for themselves, we didn’t do it.” It was Premier League clubs, not the organisation itself, that voted to reintroduce the three substitutes rule but there is increasing concern among managers at the festive schedule continuing amid a record number of Covid cases. Clearing the backlog of fixtures in an already condensed season is another issue to be addressed, with two Boxing Day matches – Liverpool v Leeds and Wolves v Watford – called off on Thursday. Benítez believes the quality of the Premier League, and by extension its attractiveness to TV rights holders, will suffer. Football Premier League: 26 December – Liverpool v Leeds, Wolves v Watford Championship: 26 December – Barnsley v Stoke, Cardiff v Coventry, Fulham v Birmingham, Millwall v Swansea, Peterborough v Reading, Preston v Sheffield United League One: 26 December – AFC Wimbledon v Charlton, Bolton v Morecambe, Crewe v Wigan, Portsmouth v Oxford, Sheffield Wednesday v Burton, Wycombe v Cambridge. 30 December – Cambridge v Doncaster League Two: 26 December – Bradford v Harrogate, Bristol Rovers v Sutton, Colchester v Leyton Orient, Exeter v Swindon, Newport v Forest Green, Northampton v Walsall, Port Vale v Salford, Stevenage v Crawley. 29 December – Forest Green v Exeter, Walsall v Bradford Rugby union Leinster forfeited their Champions Cup game at Montpellier on Friday, due to a rise in Covid-19 cases at the club. Saracens forfeited their Challenge Cup game against Pau and closed their training ground due to a significant Covid outbreak. Cricket West Indies' tour of Pakistan was cut short, with nine Covid-19 cases among the Windies squad. Three T20 games have been played, but the subsequent ODI series has been cancelled. He said: “Contracts finish in June but we finish playing in May. June could be the right time [to play these games] but then we would have to talk about the World Cup every two years or the World Cup in the winter. Money is now managing the game and it is quite complicated to find the right solution. We are professionals and have to manage the situation but the fans, everybody, want to see the best players on the pitch and playing at the best level possible. You sell the TV rights because you play nice and exciting football, but then all these things happen.” The Premier League concluded Everton have enough players to fulfil the Burnley fixture. Their available contingent includes Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who has not played for two months because of a thigh muscle re-injury, and several academy players with top-flight experience. One, the 18-year-old midfielder Tyler Onyango, has made two 89th-minute substitute appearances in the Premier League and an 85th-minute substitute’s appearance in the FA Cup. Benítez, who believes his players caught Covid when sharing a dressing room at Stamford Bridge last week, said: “They just talk about the numbers – the 13 plus one keeper – but we have nine outfield players available plus three keepers and have to bring in five young players who it seems have enough experience to play. But the reality is some of these players include Dominic Calvert-Lewin, who has been out injured for two months. We have other players with knocks and we will have to push them. They are not fit and who will take responsibility if something happens to them because they have to play 90 minutes? We are exposing them. “If you have players coming back from Covid-19 then they have to do an ECG. Who will take responsibility for these players if they are on the bench and they have to play? It’s a very clear example of just don’t follow the rules, because the rule is very unfair in this case. Some teams close their training ground. We tried to do things properly and maybe we are being punished for that. In our case the analysis was simple – they looked at the numbers and said you can play. But the reality is it is a risk for some of our players.” Despite airing the possibility of a strike, Guardiola does not believe there is appetite for one. “No I don’t think so, because we want to play, we want to continue,” the City manager said. “Make the people happy going to he stadium on the 26th, 27th, 29th, 31st and 1st and play games because we love to do that. I’m not saying there’s a reason to make a strike. But when people say World Cups, European Cups, Carabao Cup semi-finals over two legs and FA Cups and the Premier League … more teams and more games and more games and less holidays.” Manchester United’s Ralf Rangnick also expressed support for five substitutions and said most players would back that. The Premier League allowed five changes near the start of the pandemic and the interim manager said: “It was the right decision to do that, to have more options to change players, to save energy, especially if they have only just recovered from Covid. And the same is true right now. We are in a similar situation.”",Sport/Football,Guardiola makes strike claim as angry Benítez joins chorus over player welfare,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/23/pep-guardiola-strike-angry-benitez-player-welfare-premier-league
