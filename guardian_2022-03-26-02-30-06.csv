3/26/2022,"The man alleged to have murdered David Amess said he spoke to his own sister immediately after stabbing the MP 21 times and was so moved by her tears that he dropped his knife, allowing police to arrest him. Ali Harbi Ali, 26, is accused of the assassination of the veteran Conservative MP as Amess held a constituency surgery in an Essex church on 15 October 2021. The jury at the Old Bailey has heard that Ali wanted police who arrived to shoot him dead so he would, in his mind, be a martyr. Videos of police interviews with Ali were played in court in which he detailed his account of his meeting with Amess. The jury has seen video from body cameras worn by officers when they confronted and detained Ali minutes after the stabbing. The jury has been told that Ali had a foot-long knife in one hand and a phone he was talking on in the other. Officers shouted and pleaded with Ali to drop the knife, which he did after a standoff lasting just over 30 seconds, and he was handcuffed while on the floor. In a police interview afterwards, Ali said: “The only reason I dropped the knife in front of the police officer was cos my sister was on the phone crying her eyes out. It was an intense situation.” The jury has heard that Ali was worried how his actions would affect his family, and in the interview he was told: “Their houses are probably going to be raided, y’know.” In the interview, Ali berated himself for taking five years from buying the knife to using it, blaming it on “procrastination”. He said the pandemic and lockdown had also got in the way of his plans. Amess, 69, died an hour after being stabbed, and Ali told police he had deliberately struck at parts of his body to inflict maximum damage and a cause quicker death. In the interview, he was asked by PC Jody Grogan: “Mr Ali, is this a terrorist attack?” Ali replied: “I mean, I guess, yeah, I killed an MP. I done it, so yeah.” Ali denies murder and preparing other terrorist attacks, such as scouting the home and lifestyle of the cabinet minister Michael Gove. The jury heard Ali say in the police interview that by 2014 he had radicalised himself and dropped out of a City University course in radiotherapy. He said he wanted to punish an MP for a 2015 vote for airstrikes against Islamic State in Syria, and having researched a number of British lawmakers he eventually settled on Amess. In 2019, having considered going to Syria to join Islamic State, he decided against it. The prosecution says the evidence shows that in May 2019 Ali started planning possible attacks in the UK. In the video interview Ali appears calm and measured. In early portions he answers questions at length, and later he responds with “no comment”. The prosecution case closed on Friday.

3/26/2022,"My father, Dr David Rees, who has died aged 72, was a polymath whose intelligence shone out throughout his life. Dai, as he was known to all, worked at various times as a teacher of maths and statistics, for the Open University, and for the US company National Semiconductor. In the 1980s he settled in Munich, and in 1989 joined the European Patent Office. He worked his way up the organisation, becoming chairman of a board of appeal in 2008. At the EPO he wrote a decision (G3/08) on the patentability of computer-related inventions. A reference to Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass in the reasons for the decision was typical of Dai. The decision was well-received, drew worldwide press attention and has its own Wikipedia page. Both Dai’s parents were talented mathematicians with interests in science. His father Basil was based at the Bristol Aeroplane Company at the time of Dai’s birth in the city. Dai’s mother, Joan (nee Rees), was a secondary schoolteacher for maths and physics, advancing to be a deputy head. His younger brother, Gareth, went on to work in engineering. Dai attended grammar schools in Kingston upon Thames and Watford. Along with his clear abilities in mathematics, he had very broad talents and interests: he learned Russian, German and French; he played hockey; he took up classical guitar at the age of 10, and later the saxophone and bassoon. His membership of the Scouts instilled a habit of always carrying a Swiss army knife, which could cause problems at airports. In 1968 he went to Cambridge University to study maths at Jesus College. He relished the intellectual challenge and met a great group of friends; together they became the William Frend Society, named after the late-18th-century social reformer and radical fellow of Jesus College. After graduating, Dai attended the University of Keele, going on to teach maths and statistics. At Keele he met Sally Witts; they married in 1973 and I was born in 1978. During this time Dai started a postgraduate research programme to write his PhD on algebraic graph theory, specifically vertex decomposition of graphs. He was particularly proud that he had developed something new, as he was again in 1981 when my sister, Maggie, was born. In 1986, working for National Semiconductor, Dai was transferred to Germany. Dai and Sally divorced and in 1996 Dai met Marion Heegner. The two were a happy couple, playing music, visiting the Bavarian countryside, and spending time with family and friends. Dai was also a keen bridge player, playing with the same group of people for about 30 years. A voracious reader, he retired in 2014 with his flat in Munich and house in Bad Kohlgrub full of books. In July 2020, Dai was diagnosed with a brain tumour that proved fatal. He is survived by Marion, whom he married in 2019, Maggs and me, and Joan and Gareth.",News/Science,Dai Rees obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/25/dai-rees-obituary
3/26/2022,"My husband, John Needham, who has died aged 84, was an active member of the Labour party, a highly regarded permanent secretary of the Open University Students’ Association (OUSA) and a lifelong Arsenal supporter. He was brought up in a tenement flat near King’s Cross station in London. His parents, Lydia (nee Pateman) and John Needham, both worked at Whitbread’s Brewery. John was two when the second world war broke out and his father enlisted. He and his mother spent much of the war in underground shelters; their building was bombed twice. Leaving William Ellis school at 15, John worked as an office boy in the City. In the 1960s, he became an active member of St Pancras North Labour party and was eventually elected to Camden council. As chair of the libraries and arts committee, he oversaw the building of the St Pancras library and Shaw theatre. He was one of a small group of councillors who stood with tenants during the rent strike against the notorious 1971 Housing Finance Act. As a result, they were surcharged. The huge debt hung over him for years until it was revoked by the House of Lords. John and I met in the run-up to the February 1974 general election, when John was the agent for St Pancras North and I signed up as a campaign volunteer. John was one of the first to enrol in the Open University in the early 1970s, studying both the social science and science foundation courses. After the OU negotiated with a number of universities to admit students with OU course credits instead of A-levels, he became one of Lancaster University’s first full-time mature students, graduating at 40 with a 2:1 in organisation studies and sociology. After work at Sunderland Polytechnic, as general manager of the student union, John moved to Milton Keynes in 1983 to be permanent secretary of OUSA. He believed passionately in the mission of the Open University and had personal experience of its power to change lives. Soon after he joined, the university was under serious threat from a hostile Tory government. John spearheaded a campaign to support the OU, engaging students throughout Britain. A 160,000-signature petition was delivered to 10 Downing Street in November 1985. He retired in 1999 and in 2001 was awarded an honorary master’s degree, for services to OU students. John devoted much of his retirement to campaigning for patient and public involvement in the NHS – and playing golf.

3/26/2022,"My father, Frederick David, who has died aged 97, was a Holocaust refugee from Vienna who arrived in 1939 in London, the city that became his home. He trained as an economist, joining the manufacturing and distribution company Bunzl where, by the time of his retirement in 1988, he was managing director. Frederick – known as Friedl – was raised in Josefstadt in central Vienna. The son of Hugo David and Gertrud Spitzer, Friedl grew up in a large family of aunts and uncles – a colourful parade of eccentrics he would describe with customary wit. His family knew many of the celebrated Viennese artists of the time, including Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka and Egon Schiele, through his great-great uncle Alfred Spitzer, their lawyer. Following the Anschluss in 1938, Friedl, aged 14, saw the cheering crowds that greeted Hitler and persuaded his mother to seek refuge in Bielitz, Silesia, where the family owned a rice factory. From there, mother and son found safe passage to London thanks to a Czech professor, Emil Korner, who employed his mother as a housekeeper in Scotland while Friedl was sent to a private orphanage in West Norwood, a missionary home for Jewish boys run by the Baptist minister AG Parry. Friedl’s father was eventually also allowed to leave Austria. In 1949 Friedl was naturalised as a British citizen. Although he had missed out on a formal education – the orphanage took a narrow view of what teenage boys needed to know - his curiosity and acumen earned him a place at the London School of Economics, where he gained a degree in economics. There, too, he met Vladimir Derer, who became a lifelong best friend, and a founding member of the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy, a cause Friedl also supported. After a stint as a financial journalist, Friedl joined Bunzl, a business run by Viennese refugee brothers. He launched or expanded branches in the Middle East, South Africa and America. Bunzl became a constituent of the FTSE 100 and Friedl was made chairman, then managing director. He met his future wife, Carmen, at a swimming pool in Perugia, Italy, and more than 57 years later they were still swimming. North London became the couple’s home but Friedl always kept his roots in view: he teasingly named his study, a mahogany-furnished room filled with curious-looking animal ornaments, “little Vienna”. His love of opera, born in Vienna, lasted a lifetime. If his enthusiasm for gardening owed more to Highgate than Josefstadt, his support of animal charities and adoption of rescue dogs revealed an empathy with the abandoned that never left him. A wonderful husband, father and grandfather, he was unfailingly generous and open-minded. He had a delightfully mischievous sense of humour and will be remembered by many for the twinkle in his eyes.

3/26/2022,"“Something has to give and if the milk price doesn’t give, then the producers will,” says Oxfordshire dairy farmer David Christensen in a stark assessment of the peril his industry is facing as soaring costs push farm finances into the red. Christensen, whose family business manages a herd of about 1,000 cows, says costs were already going up as a result of the upheaval caused by the pandemic and Brexit, but the war in Ukraine has “turbocharged inflation to levels the like of which I’ve never seen in 30 years of farming”. He is a member of Arla, Britain’s largest dairy co-operative, which has sounded the alarm as the financial squeeze sees UK milk production start to fall – a trend that could threaten future milk supplies. Ash Amirahmadi, the managing director of Arla Foods UK, said producing fresh milk had for some time been delivering “little to no profitability for farmers” but the situation was now acute as the Ukraine crisis stoked farm cost inflation. “It is unsustainable,” he said. “The cost of producing milk is increasing like never before and our farmers are continuing to experience significant inflation. The risk of that is about the milk supply because farmers are now producing 4% less milk than they were a year ago, having had seven to eight years of growth.” The most recent official figures show that over the past year the cost of a pint of milk has risen by 7p to 49p – a 17% increase. However, the price of milk in shops last year was lower than in 2012, even though production costs have increased. The price that consumers pay is different to the amount farmers receive, and they are earning more than before. In the past year, Arla has increased its farm-gate prices by 31% to nearly 38p a litre, but costs are still marching upwards. Some supermarkets have direct contracts with farmers based on their own cost-of-production models; however, analysts suggest these contracts are not keeping up. This surge in farm costs meant Arla customers, who include supermarkets and restaurant chains, would need to dig deeper to help farmers ride out the storm, Amirahmadi said. “In the very short term, we need to put our arms around farmers and support them by paying them enough so that their costs are covered, to make sure the milk is flowing,” he said. A dairy farmer’s main costs are feed, fuel and fertiliser and all have been subject to big price hikes. “Last year I was paying 62p or 63p for the diesel I use in the tractors; the last load I bought was £1.29,” says Christensen. “It’s come back a bit but, notwithstanding that, it is a huge increase.” “Feed is my big cost and merchants are struggling to commit to a price for next winter, but are talking about at least a £100-a-tonne increase. I use in excess of 1,200 tonnes a year, if not more, so that’s a £120,000 increase.” Proportionally, the cost of fertiliser has jumped the most, says Christensen, whose milk is sold as Tesco’s own brand. “I use urea fertiliser, and this time last year I was paying about £310 or £315 a tonne, but I’ve just got a price this morning and it is £930.” This would increase his fertiliser bill overa year by £60,000. Faced with such a torrid picture, it is feared some farmers may consider quitting the industry. “These are big numbers,” says Christensen. “For many years we’ve absorbed smaller increases by becoming more efficient, by scaling – which is how we’ve coped with a deflationary milk price. The reality is when you get to these sort of numbers, you just can’t absorb those, so something has to give.”",News/Environment,‘It is unsustainable’: soaring inflation squeezes budgets of UK dairy farmers,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/25/dairy-farmers-milk-production-inflation-prices-costs
3/26/2022,"It was supposed to be a visit to mark the Queen’s diamond jubilee – a chance to present the modern face of the British monarchy to a region where republican sentiment is on the rise. But it really didn’t turn out that way. When the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge end their week-long tour of the Caribbean on Saturday, they will report back that the tour may have accelerated moves to ditch the Queen as the head of state. Calls for slavery reparations and the enduring fury of the Windrush scandal followed them across Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas – overshadowing a trip aimed at strengthening the Commonwealth and discouraging other countries from following Barbados’ example in becoming a republic. Upon arrival in Belize, the couple were met with protests from villagers over a land dispute involving a charity William is a patron of. In Jamaica, the prime minister told them in an awkward meeting that the country would be “moving on” to become a republic, and a government committee in Bahamas urged the royals to issue “a full and formal apology for their crimes against humanity”. From photos of Will and Kate shaking hands with Jamaican children through wire fences, to the military parade in which the pair stood, dressed in white, in an open top land rover, the optics of the visit has been described by local campaigners as a throwback to colonialism. “This was another photo opportunity, and rather presumptuous to assume that Jamaican people were suddenly going to welcome William and his wife with open arms,” said Velma McClymont, a writer and former Caribbean studies academic who was born in Jamaica and was aged five when the country gained independence. “My grandparents could trace generations back to slavery, but they died believing Jamaica was fully independent. Imagine, 60 years later and it’s still an extension of the British empire. It’s an infant colony, not standing alone.” Followers of the trip in the UK may have gained a different impression. On Friday, the Sun reserved its front page for the tour, gushing that “Kate dazzles on Jamaica tour” and suggesting that the pair had “touched hearts”. On Wednesday, the Daily Mail splashed a photo of Kate, the “diving duchess”, scuba-diving with nurse sharks in Belize.The same could not be said of the coverage in the Jamaican media. “It was dubbed in [the UK] media as a charm offensive, but I’m not quite so sure it came off that way. It wasn’t a royal failure, but I wouldn’t quite deem it a regal success either,” said Tyrone Reid, an associate editor at national newspaper the Jamaica Gleaner.Reid added that local publications had devoted considerable column inches to the views of “a growing number of Jamaicans demanding the British monarch and British state apologise for and accept its role in the abhorrent slave trade of years ago.” Royals experts, including one former palace PR, said that an enormous amount of planning goes in to the visits, often starting years in advance. They are led by government in line with foreign office diplomatic, culture and commercial priorities. Philip Murphy, a professor at the University of London and former director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, said that although the palace has “taken a relaxed view” about countries removing the Queen as head of state, “the British government has been less consistent about that” – ministers are thought to be anxious to preserve the soft power benefits of the Commonwealth following Brexit. “I think the Foreign Office is sometimes a bit naive, and it doesn’t have much institutional memory anymore. There are profound sensitivities around the legacies of colonialism and slavery and around the royal presence in the Caribbean, and sometimes you get the feeling that the Foreign Office doesn’t quite get it,” he said. Murphy pointed to the growing emphasis on the relationship between colonialism and racial oppression following the Black Lives Matter movement, along with damage to the royals’ reputations following Meghan Markle’s accusations of racism and the British government through the Windrush scandal. “All of those things make it politically very difficult to stage this visit at this time. You’ve got the makings of a perfect storm,” he said. A better approach to the trip – said Prof Trevor Burnard, director of the Wilberforce Institute for the Study of Slavery and Emancipation at the University of Hull – would have been for the royals to go preparedto directly acknowledge and apologise for the family’s role in the slave trade, including through memorial visits to sites connected with slavery, such as Jamaica harbour, to express sorrow instead of upbeat photo ops. “They should recognise that members of the royal family from Charles II to William IV were involved with and supported slavery and the slave trade, and that this is part of their past.” Although a “quiet minority” in Jamaica are supportive of the Queen as head of state, there is “a great deal of antipathy and resentment toward the monarchy”, said Cynthia Barrow-Giles, a professor at the University of West Indies who has researched the British monarchy in the Caribbean. “[The visit] smacks of political opportunism and is disturbingly self-serving,” she said. Many members of Commonwealth countries in the Caribbean are increasingly questioning its purpose, especially since they have received little support during the pandemic, which has devastated Jamaican economy and left 120,000 children out of school, and are pointing to unequal access to vaccines, which has resulted in nearly 3,000 deaths in an island of 3 million people. Jennifer Housen, a lawyer in Jamaica, said the fact the UK revoked visa-free access for Jamaicans in 2003, with applications regularly refused, have led people to feel “the relationship is pointless”. “These are discussions we need to be having with them – not pretty flags and smiling black children pushing their hand through chain fences to say: ‘Oh, you know, I’ve touched the royals’; that’s garbage, that’s fostering something that is completely cringeworthy.” The reparations movement has been growing considerably over the Caribbean in recent years, led by the 15-country strong intergovernmental Caricom Reparations Commission. Rosalea Hamilton, one of the campaigners for Advocates Network who organised slavery reparations protests in Jamaica, said there was currently a “heightened consciousness of the history”, including “understanding of the legacies of colonialism today, economic, sociological, psychological”. There is, she says, an increased awareness that this has led to trauma in the population that impacts confidence levels, along with swathes of the population living in “unhealthy, unsanitary, unsafe” conditions. The reparations movement has been “gathering significant steam”, said Reid, in part because of increased access to information about Jamaica’s history that goes beyond the school textbooks that have traditionally taught a British interpretation of history. “The man on the street is demanding reparations as well, it’s not just at the intellectual level. That’s when you know something is really gathering momentum, when it’s spreading across a broad section of society. More people are recognising the horror of slavery and the atrocities that were committed, and becoming aware of the impact that has on modern day life.”",News/UK news,‘Perfect storm’: William and Kate’s awkward Caribbean tour ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/25/william-and-kate-caribbean-tour-slavery-reparations-royals
3/26/2022,"A man who murdered his ex-girlfriend’s two-year-old son in south London has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 25 years after the couple’s horrific abuse was captured on secret recordings. Kyrell Matthews was left with 41 rib fractures and internal injuries by the time of his death in October 2019 after weeks of cruelty at the hands of Kemar Brown and Phylesia Shirley, the Old Bailey in London heard. Brown, 28, was convicted of murder after a trial earlier this month, while Shirley, 24, who had previously worked in children’s services at Croydon council, was acquitted of murder but found guilty of the alternative charge of manslaughter. Jurors had not been told that Kyrell suffered a significant injury to the side of his face in May 2019, five months before his death, and spent five days in Croydon University hospital. The hospital carried out an investigation and found Shirley’s explanation that the little boy had fallen off a sofa and hit his head on a highchair was “plausible”. In addition, jurors were not told police were called to a domestic incident three months before Kyrell’s death but no offences were identified and the boy was said to have appeared “safe and well”. A passerby had alerted officers on 17 July 2019 after hearing shouting and screaming coming from their flat, with a female voice saying: “Stop hitting my face.” The couple appeared alongside each other in the dock on Friday as Brown was sentenced to at least 25 years in prison while Shirley was jailed for 13 years. The toddler, who was non-verbal, could be heard crying and screaming on distressing audio files taken from Shirley’s phone and played to jurors during the trial. Multiple recordings taken over the final weeks of his life picked up the sound of Kyrell being hit repeatedly, with Brown, who has a number of violence-related convictions, saying: “Shut up” and: “You have to ruin the fun.” Another recording caught Shirley striking her son and causing him to break down in distress. The capturing of the abuse on mobile phone recordings has echoes of similar cases in recent months. Sixteen-month-old Star Hobson and Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, six, were killed as a result of physical abuse and, like Kyrell, both children had been referred to social services. Prosecutor Edward Brown QC told jurors that the mother had put her relationship with Brown above her own child. The couple, who were unemployed at the time of Kyrell’s murder, are understood to have been visited by social services at least once. “[Shirley] was prepared to reject what should have been motherly care in protecting Kyrell in favour of abuse by her – his own mother – and in favour of the abuse carried out by a man she knew was abusing her child,” the prosecutor told jurors. “The truth is that his death came when once more he was abused in that flat, once more in a very similar way, causing very similar injuries, except on this occasion it was so much more serious, the abuse and the results were catastrophic.” In a 111 call made after Kyrell collapsed at home on 20 October 2019, Shirley sobbed as she was told by a clinical adviser to use both hands and “push down fast” and “go for it”. Both defendants, from separate addresses in Thornton Heath, declined to give evidence during trial, but the court heard Brown‘s defence was that the injuries inflicted were the result of incorrect advice from the operator on how to resuscitate Kyrell. Paying tribute to Kyrell outside court after the couple were convicted, his paternal step-grandmother, Christine Ernest, said he was “the most loving little boy, always smiling”.",News/UK news,Killers of ‘loving little boy’ Kyrell Matthews jailed ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/25/kyrell-matthews-killers-jailed-murder-manslaughter-london
3/26/2022,"A 17-year-old girl and two men have been given life sentences for the sadistic homophobic murder of a consultant psychiatrist described by his family as a “kind soul”. The three tortured Dr Gary Jenkins, a father of two, by kicking and punching him and stamping on his head for up to 28 minutes as he begged them to stop. During the ferocious attack and robbery in Bute Park, Cardiff, Jenkins, 54, was subject to homophobic abuse and the three left him partially clothed. Afterwards, Dionne Timms-Williams, who was 16 at the time and had not met her fellow attackers before, said: “I needed that.” Sentencing the trio at Cardiff crown court, Judge Daniel Williams said Jason Edwards, Lee Strickland and Timms-Williams went to the park looking for a homosexual man to rob. Williams said the attack was homophobic and each was equally to blame. Paying tribute to Jenkins, the judge said: “The world is drabber for his passing, it’s less kind, less colourful. He gave his professional life to relieve suffering of others and he went the extra mile for his patients.” Edwards and Strickland will each serve a minimum term of 33 years in prison before they are eligible for parole. Timms-Williams, 17, will serve 18 years before she can be considered for parole. They will spend the rest of their lives on licence. In her victim impact statement, Jenkins’ wife, Maria, said he would never have hurt anyone. “Gary was smart and funny, the heart and soul of every party,” she said. “He was an incredibly generous and creative man with only good intentions. The reality of his torture and death has hit us hard.” She said Jenkins’ young daughters’ lives had been “massively” affected. “They are struggling in areas where they were thriving, such as their education and emotional state. All of us have nightmares and daytime flashbacks.” She added: “The loss of many more years and happy times Gary could have had with his daughters has been very distressing. Gary had so much more of his life to live. “Gary’s private life being put on display has only intensified the impact. It has been horrible to have to listen to the details of what happened. Gary’s death has also had an impact on his patients. He was a dedicated and hard-working doctor. He always went the extra mile. He is greatly missed by his colleagues and patients. There are no winners in this case, only losers.” Louis Williams, a passerby who went to Jenkins’ aid, said in his impact statement that he regretted not being a better fighter so he could have done more to help. He said he now feared for his family’s safety, and that Timms-Williams’s involvement had made him question whether there was something wrong in society. Caroline Rees QC, for Timms-Williams, said she had experienced trauma that had led to drug and alcohol dependency. She denied she was homophobic and said she had shown remorse. Rees said the girl, who lived with her mother in a village in the Vale of Glamorgan, had not met the two male attackers before and was vulnerable. The court heard she received a caution in 2019 for possessing a blade. Edwards has 35 previous convictions and Strickland 58, though neither had been found guilty before of serious violence. Both had drug and alcohol issues and the judge said neither had shown remorse. The case caused an outpouring of grief and concern, with campaigners pointing out that the murder of Jenkins, a bisexual man, was an example of a string of hate crimes that coincided with release from lockdown. There was also anger at how the prosecution presented the case, telling the court that the victim’s “sexual predilections would be his undoing”. The jury heard that Jenkins had separated from his wife six years before his murder and moved back to his home city of Cardiff. He was in the park in the early hours of 20 July last year when the three, who had been drinking, attacked him. Audio of part of the attack was picked up by a CCTV camera in a shuttered cafe. He could be heard crying out: “Please help me” and repeatedly calling out: “Stop it” and “Why?” One of the men could be heard subjecting him to homophobic abuse and one urged: “Stamp on his head.” After the attack, Edwards and Timms-Williams embraced. Strickland bought a bottle of whisky using a card stolen from Jenkins.

3/26/2022,"Calls have erupted for ethical conflict-of-interest rules on America’s top court after it was revealed that Ginni Thomas, wife of the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, pressed Donald Trump’s White House chief of staff to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. The Washington Post reported that it had obtained a stash of 29 text messages between Ginni Thomas and Mark Meadows, then Trump’s top White House aide, which were exchanged in the tumultuous days after the November 2020 election. In the texts, Thomas blatantly urged Meadows to do anything he could to subvert the democratic result so as to frustrate Joe Biden’s victory and keep Trump in power. Ethics groups, members of Congress, law professors, media pundits and a slew of other interested parties have responded to the revelations with astonishment and concern. The Thomas-Meadows texts were contained in a trove of 2,320 digital communications that Meadows has handed to the House select committee investigating the storming of the US Capitol by Trump supporters on 6 January. Those communications were only obtained by the committee after the supreme court ordered them to be transferred to Congress, rejecting claims by Trump that they were covered by executive privilege. The court forced disclosure of the material, including the Ginni Thomas texts, by a vote of 8 to 1 – with Clarence Thomas providing the only dissent. Norman Ornstein, a senior emeritus fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, called the development “a scandal of immense proportions”. Branding Ginni Thomas a “radical insurrectionist”, he said it was time for the January 6 committee to subpoena her texts and emails to see what other incriminating evidence was out there. Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard law school, called on the justice department to investigate the apparent conspiracy between Thomas, Meadows and Trump. “Hard to see Justice Thomas not recusing when that reaches” the supreme court, he said. Gabe Roth, executive director of Fix the Court, which campaigns for reform of the supreme court, told the Guardian that the rule of law depended not just on impartiality, but on the appearance of impartiality. “There is a lack of moral authority on the supreme court right now, there is a lack of trust, and the court needs to acknowledge it and take steps to ameliorate it,” Roth said. The commotion has come at a torrid time for the supreme court. On Friday Clarence Thomas himself was discharged from hospital having been treated for days with an infection. Millions of Americans also viewed the televised spectacle of the first Black woman to be nominated for the highest court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, being subjected to bizarre and hostile questioning by Republicans in her confirmation hearings. Senators including Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley pressed her on her sentencing record of sex offenders in child-abuse imagery cases, and on anti-racist teaching in schools in ways that at times came closer to dog-whistle politics than a solemn constitutional process. That Ginni Thomas was using her considerable network of contacts to try to subvert democracy came as little surprise to close observers of US politics. For decades she has acted as a prominent champion of ultra-rightwing causes, heading her own lobbying firm, Liberty Consulting, since 2010. In recent months, concern about apparent conflicts of interest relating to Clarence Thomas, who is the longest-serving of the nine justices on the supreme court, and his wife has been intensifying. Investigative articles by Jane Mayer in the New Yorker and by the New York Times have raised red flags about the interplay of such a leading rightwing lobbyist and her powerful judicial husband. The direct connection between Ginni’s texts and Clarence’s dissent in the supreme court’s ruling over disclosure of those same texts to Congress takes the issue to a new level. It raises the question of whether Clarence Thomas had any awareness of what was in the material that the January 6 committee demanded to see. As Dan Rather, the former CBS News anchor, put it: “What does Clarence Thomas know? And when did he know it?” The Thomases have always denied that they discuss each other’s work. In one of her texts, however, written three weeks after the 2020 election, she responded to Meadows – who described the attempt to overturn Biden’s win as “a fight of good versus evil” – by saying: “Thank you!! Needed that! This plus a conversation with my best friend just now … I will try to keep holding on.” “My best friend”, although veiled, was beyond doubt a reference to her husband, according to Mayer of the New Yorker, who tweeted: “‘best friend’ is how the Thomases refer to one another”. Mayer is one of many commentators who are now wondering whether it is time for an ethics code to be imposed on the supreme court – which is the only federal judicial panel in the country not to be governed by any such safeguards against corruption or conflict of interest. All other federal judges, including appeals court judges, are subject to a rule that says that they must recuse themselves in any matter in which “he or his spouse” is a party to, or has an interest in, the proceedings. Supreme court justices are required to recuse if their impartiality “might reasonably be questioned”. But as the constitutional law expert Steve Vladeck noted, there is no effective enforcement mechanism, underlining the need for a more solid set of ethics rules. The exposure of Ginni Thomas’s texts was revealed by Bob Woodward, of Watergate fame, and his Washington Post colleague Robert Costa, adding a patina of journalistic royalty to the furore, which has left even observers well versed in Thomas’s extreme politics astounded by how far she was willing to go in espousing a political coup on behalf of Trump. In her Meadows texts she regurgitated a conspiracy theory embraced by QAnon supporters that Trump had watermarked ballots sent by mail supposedly in order to detect voter fraud. She also sent Meadows a video – backing Trump’s big lie that the election was stolen from him – created by a far-right “truther”. The video maker had previously claimed that the 2012 gun massacre at Sandy Hook elementary school in Connecticut, in which 20 children were murdered, was an invention cooked up by gun-control advocates. Before the text messages emerged, Thomas’s links to Trump’s big lie were already known. She attended the January 6 “Save America” rally in Washington hours before the Capitol insurrection, posting on Twitter: “LOVE MAGA people!!!!” GOD BLESS EACH OF YOU STANDING UP or PRAYING!” “This is a really sad state of affairs,” Roth told the Guardian. “That a longtime political operative like Ginni Thomas should go down such a rabbit hole saddens me deeply.”",News/Law,Ginni Thomas texts spark ethical storm about husband’s supreme court role,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/mar/25/ginni-thomas-texts-clarence-ethics-supreme-court-conflict-of-interest
3/26/2022,"The school in which a 15-year-old black girl experienced a traumatic strip search by police officers have confirmed that they were not aware that the incident had taken place, and that no members of staff were present. A statement by the Hackney school’s governing board said that “while the school was not aware that a strip search was taking place, we wholly accept that the child should not have been left in the situation that she was”. They added that due to this, they have “offered a full and formal apology to Child Q and her family, and continue to work with them to provide what support we can.” The statement also claimed that “changes were made immediately after the incident, and continued to be made”, citing that the makeup and leadership of the governing board has changed and how the school engages with the police “has completely evolved”. This comes after the Metropolitan police admitted that the school “probably should not have called us and we should probably have understood very quickly that we had no role to play there”. The school added that they would not be commenting on the employment status of individuals, including the teachers involved in the incident and those who called the police officers into the school. The statement comes after Philip Glanville, the mayor of Hackney, had called for the head teacher of the school to resign, saying that it was clear that “school leadership has lost the confidence of the school, myself and the community”. In December 2020, a 15-year-old black schoolgirl was subjected to a strip search by police officers after having been wrongly accused of possessing cannabis. The search, which has left the young girl traumatised and requiring therapy, involved the exposure of intimate body parts in the knowledge that the girl was menstruating. Her parents were not informed of the incident by the school or by the officers. Legal proceedings on behalf of the child have been launched against the school and the Metropolitan police, with her mother also saying that the family hoped an Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation would mean the officers involved were “individually held to account and face real consequences for what they have done”. A safeguarding report into the incident which was published last week said that “racism was likely to have been an influencing factor in the decision to undertake a strip search.” At a community meeting in Hackney on Wednesday evening, hosted by Hackney’s Basic Unit commander Marcus Barnett, a police officer admitted that the Met has a problem with officers viewing inner London children as “adults”, adding that what happened to Child Q would probably not have happened to a child living in the Cotswolds, as an example. “I think we view inner London kids as adults, the issue we have in policing at the moment is that we view kids and we believe that kids in London are more resilient than they are,” said detective superintendent Dan Rutland, who was also on the panel. Hundreds of people including Labour MP Diane Abbott attended a demonstration last Friday outside Stoke Newington police station in north-east London in support of Child Q. Chants of “Racist cops, out of schools” were heard by the crowd while signs reading “We say no to police in schools” and “No to racist police” were held aloft. In a statement issued by her lawyers, the girl said that after everything she had been through: “I know I am not alone”.",News/UK news,Child Q school confirms staff were not aware strip search had taken place,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/25/child-q-school-confirms-staff-were-not-aware-strip-search-had-taken-place
3/26/2022,"Vladimir Putin has accused the west of discriminating against Russian culture, comparing the treatment of Russian cultural figures with that of the “cancelled” Harry Potter author JK Rowling. At a televised meeting on Friday with leading cultural figures, Putin said the west was “trying to cancel a whole 1,000-year culture, our people”, citing cancellations of events involving Russian artists in protest at the invasion of Ukraine. “They’re now engaging in the cancel culture, even removing Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich and Rachmaninov from posters. Russian writers and books are now cancelled,” Putin said. A number of events involving Russian cultural figures who have expressed backing for the war have been called off, including concerts by the award-winning Russian conductor Valery Gergiev, a friend and supporter of Putin, who was part of the meeting on Friday. Some events involving dead Russian cultural figures have also been abandoned, with the Cardiff Philharmonic Orchestra removing the Russian composer Tchaikovsky from its programme, a decision that was widely criticised by western cultural figures. Putin said in his address that the last time such a campaign had been waged against “unwanted literature” was when Nazi supporters burned books in the 1930s. He went on to compare the treatment Russia had received with the controversy surrounding Rowling’s comments on transgender people. “Recently they cancelled the children’s writer Joanne Rowling because she – the author of books that have sold hundreds of millions of copies worldwide – fell out of favour with fans of so-called gender freedoms,” Putin said. Rowling on Friday distanced herself from Putin’s comments by sharing an article about the jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny on Twitter. “Critiques of western cancel culture are possibly not best made by those currently slaughtering civilians for the crime of resistance, or who jail and poison their critics,” the British author wrote, adding the hashtag #IStandWithUkraine. Putin has in the past repeatedly expressed his disdain of western “liberal” values, comparing cancel culture with the coronavirus. When asked last year by a Russian journalist about Rowling, Putin said he “adhered to the traditional approach – a woman is a woman, a man is a man, a mother is a mother, a father is a father”. Andrei Kolesnikov, of the Carnegie Moscow Center, said Putin’s address on Friday gave another insight into the “distorted” view the Russian leader had of the west. “Putin uses the information he receives from advisers and then creates his own reality of the west,” Kolesnikov said. “He hears about some extreme examples that happen in the west and then convinces himself that this is the trend. He doesn’t like the nuance.” Kolesnikov said Friday’s meeting with the Russian cultural elite was meant to show the Russian public that the west was waging a parallel cultural war against the country, four weeks after Moscow’s invasion into Ukraine. “Putin wants to tell Russians that they are under siege, also culturally. In his eyes the west is in a relentless war against traditional Russian values,” he said.",News/World news,Putin says west treating Russian culture like ‘cancelled’ JK Rowling,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/putin-says-west-treating-russian-culture-like-cancelled-jk-rowling
3/26/2022,"Tonight, says Jermaine Fowler, “I’m just prepping stuff for my next standup film.” It’s an underwhelming opening from the Coming 2 America star – whose UK debut is not being sold as a work-in-progress. Sure enough, Fowler duly lingers close to his little red notebook for much of the hour, reminding himself whether the next bit is about his jailbird twin, his rescue hamsters, or the time he spent half an hour on Whoopi Goldberg’s space-age toilet. That doesn’t prevent the 33-year-old delivering a very genial set: he’s a warm and engaging presence, and develops an open, easy rapport with his mouthy late-night crowd. But this is a standup appearance still developing into a coherent show. Broadly, it traces Fowler’s family background, growing up poor, his teenage parents variously into Christianity, dating strippers and homemade porn. There’s the raw material here for a rewarding narrative about Fowler’s journey out of that world, and its counterpoints in the lives of those he left behind – or, in the case of a long-lost sister, never knew. But for now, it’s coming at us in fragments rather than a structured whole. Taken in that spirit, there’s plenty to enjoy, most of it autobiographical anecdotes from Fowler’s upbringing in Washington DC, then Maryland. Sometimes, it’s noticeable more for authenticity than craft: these often sound like more or less amusing stories lifted wholesale from Fowler’s life and minimally processed into comedy. But Fowler elevates them with his breezy, emotionally intimate manner: the show feels like a real conversation. And the best of his material vividly conjures the peculiarities of his family life: his devout dad anointing his forehead with olive oil; tensions between “the gay Crips and the Christian Bloods” across the aisle at his mom’s funeral. Latterly, the story of his “crazy family” broadens to recount Fowler’s search – as touching as it is funny – for a sister, long ago given up for adoption. The routine about schmoozing with Goldberg feels like an afterthought; one doubts it’ll make the final cut of his film. But on this evidence, and with a little more prep, it should still be worth watching.

3/26/2022,"AGerman torpedo struck the P&O liner Persia at lunchtime on 30 December 1915, when the ship was about 40 miles south-east of Crete and making all speed towards India via the Suez canal. In the dining saloon John Douglas-Scott-Montagu, the second Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, had just finished his soup. One of the ship’s boilers blew up, the sea flooded in, and the Persia sank so quickly that it dragged lifeboats down with it and left hardly any wreckage for those in the sea to grasp; out of the 519 people onboard, only 176 survived. Lord Montagu was among them. He managed to swim to an upturned boat and clung to it, together with a few other Europeans and several Indian seamen, known as lascars. Over the next 32 hours three vessels passed without stopping because they feared the U-boat had set a trap. One by one, Montagu’s companions died until of the original 33 there were only 11 left. He had lots to think about – where, for example, was the secretary-cum-mistress who had been sailing with him? (As it turned out, she was dead.) But Montagu’s thoughts turned to a different horror. What worried him, he wrote later, was “how best an Englishman might die when there were lascars to watch his end”. Like many people whose friends and relations had been at sea – a common experience in the 1950s, when Britain still possessed the world’s largest merchant fleet – I knew the word lascar from quite an early age. My father had sailed for a year or so as a junior engineer with the British India line and he liked to remember the Indian crew, their goats tethered on deck for later slaughter, and the language that they and their British superiors used to make each other understandable. Lascari-bat was rudimentary Hindustani. He would recall a few commanding words and phrases. Ab chup raho; kam karo: “Now hold your tongue and get to work.” The family album had a box-camera snap of their foreman, or serang, a man with a large moustache and a fez-like hat. Dad used fond phrases like “a real character”. The serang’s men had shovelled coal into the furnaces and kept steam up all the way from Falmouth to Queensland and back again via Colombo. As a workforce, they were reliable and steady (unusually among seafarers, drink was never a problem), and popular with ships’ captains and shipowners, who had begun to recruit them in the 17th century. When steam replaced sail on the routes from Europe to India and the far east, the demand for their labour grew – in contrast to seacraft, steamships needed the more easily acquired skills of stokers, engine-greasers, stewards and cooks – and by 1914 they made up between a quarter and a fifth of the total crew aboard British ships. What recommended them most to shipowners, of course, was their cost compared with British seamen. They accepted lower wages, slept in poorer lodgings, and ate cheaper food; and all this because acts of parliament exempted them from the laws governing the terms and conditions of their British equivalents. Their employment, which had begun on ships plying the sea lanes of the Indian Ocean, caused alarm among European seamen when it spread westwards to ships in the Atlantic trades. In the 1880s, newly formed maritime unions began to agitate and protest. In 1892, fighting a campaign to become the Tory MP for Barrow in Furness, the shipowner Charles Cayzer found himself barracked at meetings by chants of “coolies, coolies” and described by rivals as “the coolie candidate” because his extensive fleet, the Clan Line, employed so many Indians and deprived honest Britons of jobs. This old fear of cheap labour found an echo this week in the opposition to the abject behaviour of P&O Ferries, which sacked 800 seafarers without notice or consultation, cheerfully admitted breaking the law, and announced its intention to pay most of their replacements well below the minimum wage. The origins of the new recruits have not been disclosed. India was mentioned; it may not be true. What seems to be the case is that, if P&O succeed, the new crews (two to each vessel) will have to work twice as hard as the old ones (four crews per vessel) for a rate averaging £5.50 an hour. This kind of capitalism knows no quarter: Ab chup raho; kam karo. Trade unions want the vessels to be impounded and their crews rehired, but that may not be so easily done. Thanks to the laissez-faire policies of successive governments, P&O’s ferries are owned in Dubai, built in Germany, Finland and Italy, and registered in the Bahamas and Cyprus (the move from registration in Dover was said to have been prompted by Brexit). In that context, a British crew looks like an anomaly, a quaint relic from the habits of the pre-globalised world. As Mick Lynch, the general secretary of the RMT union, told the parliamentary inquiry into P&O this week, “The politicians and lawyers in this country have watched over the last 30 years [as] our merchant marine has been decimated.” Soon, he said, “we won’t have a merchant navy … British ships … and British ratings will cease to exist”. I think of the things I used to know. For instance, that P&O, like several other illustrious lines, had Scottish foundations; that a Shetland man, a sailor turned shipbroker called Arthur Anderson, was the principal founder in 1837, the year Victoria came to the throne; that the P stood for Peninsular, meaning Iberia, and the O for Oriental, a direction at first limited to the eastern Mediterranean and eventually reaching as far as east as Japan and Australia; that the word posh is believed to have come from the best way to travel to and from India: port cabins on the way out and starboard side home. When P&O amalgamated with British India Steam Navigation in 1914, the result was the world’s largest shipping conglomerate, led by James Lyle Mackay, a brilliant and hard-headed businessman from Arbroath who as Lord Inchcape was offered and declined the throne of Albania, saying it was not in his line. Its ships evolved a distinctive quality that other companies – even Cunard – found hard to match. A P&O commander described it as “the sort of thing to be found in good hotels or clubs to which wealth alone does not give an entree”. A book published in 1986 to celebrate the firm’s 150th anniversary could speak of a “phenomenal company” that had diversified into enterprises well beyond shipping but remained anchored to traditions of trust, loyalty, service and pride. Less than 20 years later its shareholders sold the whole caboodle, minus its cruise liners, to the rulers of Dubai for £3.3bn. As to the lascars, many died at sea during the two world wars – a disproportionate number in fact, blamed until relatively recently on the idea that they succumbed more quickly to the cold. Most retired to the places they had come from, which was mainly Bengal, where they spent their savings on houses that had a “tank” or bathing pond attached and a short row of palm trees planted to the front. A minority never went home and settled instead where their ships had docked, which in Britain was east London. There they fathered the first generation of Indian restaurateurs, to whose restaurants Englishmen came after a night in the pub to slump at the tables and fall off the chairs and call to the waiter, “Hey, Gunga Din”; and were somehow ignored and perhaps even forgiven. The noble and gracious England of the second Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, supposing it ever existed, had most certainly disappeared.

3/26/2022,"The drawing depicts a woman in a red Alexander Wang dress and blue prison socks. A thought bubble next to her reads: “Send bitcoin.” The chair in which she sits has “Wanted” written on its back. The woman is Anna Sorokin – the notorious fake German heiress whose scams of high society were exposed in a Vanity Fair article and then turned into the hit Netflix drama Inventing Anna – and the drawing is part of a group art show in a Lower East Side museum that showcases her work. Kind of. Until the end of March, the show – Free Anna Delvey, a reference to the faux heiress’s preferred surname – is displaying drawings and other artworks, mostly by 33 artists who claim to have been “inspired” by Sorokin’s story. It also includes five of Sorokin’s own 22x30in pencil and acrylic drawings, made while she was in jail – though, as so often in the past with Sorokin, that’s not quite true, given that the drawings were in fact reproduced on large-print watercolor paper by Alfred Martinez, the show’s co-curator. “If she’s gonna get someone to copy her artwork, it’s good she got a Basquiat forger to do it,” Martinez told Insider, referencing the fact that in the early 2000s he spent two years in jail for selling Basquiat paintings he’d forged. Julia Morrison, the show’s other co-curator, told the New York Times that she initially discovered Sorokin’s drawings while browsing Instagram. “No one is just a villain, or just a hero,” said Morrison, an artist whose own claim to infamy is minting NFTs of screenshotted messages of sex slavery and cannibalism that she said the actor Armie Hammer had sent her. Morrison said she identified closely with Sorokin’s story because her own mother had served time in an immigration detention facility. Sorokin is being detained by Ice after completing a four-year prison sentence for second-degree grand larceny, theft of services and first-degree attempted grand larceny. The Netflix documentary, which depicts Sorokin’s rise and fall as a con artist in New York City, did not apparently meet with Sorokin’s approval despite reports she was paid six figures to consult on the show. “That superglam portrayal of me in the Netflix series is not that accurate,” she told the New York Times, adding that she wanted the Free Anna Delvey art show – which she helped coordinate and produce from her detention cell – to give the public a look into “her side of the story”, as Martinez told Forbes. “Art is only partly about talent and determination and even more so about the artist’s ability to demand attention through their personality and story. And this is where she really shines,” he said. Anna’s reproduced sketches are priced at $10,000 each. She claims that 15% of the sale price of one of the drawings will be donated to a children’s charity. According to Martinez, 25% of the show’s proceeds will go towards Sorokin’s legal defense. Sorokin’s legal team is fighting her deportation. Earlier this month, her lawyer filed a last-minute appeal to immigration authorities, hours before she was scheduled to be deported to Germany, citing “serious health issues”. Sorokin was granted emergency consideration. She has since sued ICE, with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), claiming she caught Covid-19 while in detention after Ice officials allegedly denied her requests for a vaccine booster shot.",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘Free Anna Delvey’: Anna Sorokin’s art show features works inspired by fake heiress,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/25/free-anna-delvey-art-show-fake-heiress-anna-sorokin
3/26/2022,"Janet Martin, 45, an author and content creator, lives in a two-bedroom flat in Deptford, south London, with her husband Wari Orumbie, 48, and their two daughters. “This flat was originally Wari’s bachelor pad – all blokey brown leather and minimalist decor,” laughs Janet. “I moved in when I was eight months pregnant with our daughter Jasmine. She’s nine now, and her sister, Roselyn, is eight, and we’ve slowly redecorated almost every room over the years.” But life got in the way of making over the couple’s bedroom. “We concentrated on the kids and work, and our room slipped down the list of priorities. It was never given any love,” says Janet. “Whenever we needed more storage, we just added another piece of furniture without any real thought, meaning nothing matched; and we never seemed to have enough room. There was stuff on top of the wardrobe, clothes spilling from laundry baskets, shoes everywhere – but we didn’t have the time or headspace to sort it out.” Then came lockdown, which made matters worse. “Wari, who’s a manager with the NHS, started working from home, and our bedroom became his office,” says Janet, who also used the room for work calls. “We panic-bought a small fold-up table for £20 from eBay to use as a temporary desk – we had no idea he’d still be using it almost two years later. It turned out to be bad for his back so he started balancing his laptop on a chest of drawers so he could stand up to work.” The set-up was impractical and invaded every aspect of life. “Wari often uses three monitors, and there were work papers and wires everywhere. An extension lead even snaked under my pillow. “I tried creating a little area where I could unwind by reading or using an aromatherapy diffuser for meditation. But the clutter made it impossible to switch off. It was the first thing I saw in the morning and the last thing at night. Something had to change.” To bring about that change, Janet sat down with IKEA’s interior design team so she and Wari could find a way to make their multifunctional room work better. “I talked to them about what we wanted from the space, as well as the colours and styles I liked; and they translated this into a fantastic plan,” she says. The plan recognised that we demand a lot from our homes these days, with many of us using them for work, exercise, rest and play. Yet because less than half of us feel our homes meet our work-related needs, according to IKEA’s 2021 Life at Home report, that can result in stress and frustration. IKEA believes that every home should be a sanctuary, and its research shows that to achieve this a property needs to deliver on three levels: function – whether a room works as you need it to; emotional stability – whether the room makes you feel happy and calm; and space – even a small room can feel spacious when properly designed. When IKEA’s experts looked at Janet’s room, it was clear it was falling short on all three counts. “When you’re planning a room like this, you obviously want to consider how to maximise the space, but you also have to consider your needs and dreams, as well as the functionality – how you want to live in the room,” says IKEA designer Clotilde Passalacqua, part of a team taking on three makeovers for the Guardian Labs over the next few months to show how homes can become sanctuaries. “Janet and Wari needed somewhere they could work comfortably, but also somewhere they could relax and switch off at night.” The team’s first suggestion was to move the bed. “There’s rarely only one possible combination of furniture for a room,” says Clotilde. “Sometimes it’s a matter of looking at it afresh. In Janet’s case, switching the bed to the opposite side of the room freed up a longer wall for more useful storage.” For Janet, this simple tweak made a huge difference: “It’s amazing how much bigger the room looks,” she says. “It really opened up the space.” The next step was to tackle the couple’s clothes. Clotilde felt that IKEA’s Platsa wardrobe and storage system would be perfect. “Not only can it be customised to fit any sized space, it’s aesthetically beautiful too, so you can fit in a lot of storage without the furniture visually overwhelming the room,” she says. “People tend to think the size of your wardrobe is what matters, but what’s more important is how well it’s organised inside; if you’ve only got one rail for hanging and pile all your shoes at the bottom, it will never feel big enough. With the Platsa, we could include different height rails, shelves, laundry bags and storage baskets tailored to Janet’s needs, so that everything has a home and is easy to access.” The IKEA team created a bank of storage with two wardrobes, two Malm chests of drawers, a high-level shelf and a cabinet. “Rather than a full wall of floor-to-ceiling storage, we’ve broken it up visually,” says Clotilde. A half-depth Platsa wardrobe on a previously unused wall at the room entrance provides a home for coats; wall hooks give Janet somewhere to hang her dressing gown and clothes for the day ahead; while the bed has storage underneath. “It’s a really practical solution – you can neatly stash larger items such as bed linen and duvets,” says Clotilde. The results are transformational, Janet says. “There’s a home for absolutely everything now – it’s phenomenal. The high new wardrobes give us plenty of room inside for clothes, with shoes at the bottom, and shelves and baskets overhead.” With clutter tamed, attention turned to Wari’s desk. “The team created a little home office area in the corner, facing the window so we can look at the trees,” says Janet. “The desk is particularly clever as it can be raised to become a standing desk at the push of a button. It’s big enough that Wari can spread out for work, but at the end of the day he can tidy everything away thanks to the Eket cabinets above the desk and a wall-mounted tidy. Even our wires have been hidden in a wicker basket – it’s all very pleasing to the eye and so different from before.” Lighting and soft furnishings were next on the list. “We hadn’t given much thought to lighting beyond the central ceiling pendant,” says Janet. “But now we have so many options to create different moods, including two bedside lamps and a natural daylight lamp. We can control the temperature and brightness of the LEDs using a remote – the light casts a beautiful glow in the evening, making it so much easier to unwind in here. I hadn’t realised how much of a difference lighting would make – I actively want to spend time in the room now.” Among Janet’s favourite items are the sheer, muted blue curtains. “They’re opaque, but you can still see movement and light outside. I love the way they sway when there’s a breeze – they’re stunning.” A big surprise for Janet and Wari was how much they enjoyed the process of creating a room that truly serves their needs. “It was great seeing the space in a different way, with fresh eyes,” says Janet. “I’m amazed at how some of the smallest details – like the wall hooks and the labelled containers in our wardrobe for sportswear and holiday clothes – have immeasurably improved the ambience and the way we use the room. “Now there’s no more clutter, I feel my brain can function better. Working here, we can think without distractions. I used to be embarrassed making Zoom calls at our old desk, but I’m never going to blur my background again – this room needs to be shown off. “It’s incredible what upgrading your existing space can do for the way you live. Instead of making me depressed, I now walk in the room and instantly feel calm. It truly is the sanctuary we needed.” With inventive solutions for everything from clutter busting to lighting and decor, IKEA is on a mission to turn every home into a sanctuary.
