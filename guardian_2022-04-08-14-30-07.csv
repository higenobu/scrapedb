4/8/2022,"Airlines and cross-Channel services are braced for their busiest weekend since the start of the pandemic, with outbound and returning holidaymakers set to swell numbers at ports that are already struggling to cope with surging demand. With all areas of the UK now on Easter holidays, passengers have been told to allow extra time to negotiate airport queues, as high rates of Covid infections worsen staff shortages at check-in and security. Meanwhile, tailbacks on the major roads to the Channel are expected to intensify, as Eurotunnel anticipates rising traffic in both directions and P&O Ferries services remain suspended. Passengers booked with P&O on the Dover-Calais route have been told they cannot travel this weekend, as the rival operator DFDS, which had been accommodating P&O customers, is now fully booked. Airports are redeploying office staff with security clearance to frontline roles where possible to help mitigate the chaotic scenes of recent days, particularly at Manchester airport. Manchester appeared to cope slightly better on Thursday, according to passenger reports on social media, but admitted it would be some time before its operations functioned normally. A spokesperson said passengers could still face waits in security of 60-90 minutes in “the next few months”. They advised arriving at the airport three hours before flight departure, and asked passengers to ensure they were fully prepared to comply with security rules on liquids and electrical items to minimise delay. The Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, said this week it would take two months for the airport to bring in enough staff, and urged the government to help speed up the security clearance of new recruits. Police and transport staff from the city will be drafted in to help manage queues at the local authority-owned airport. EasyJet, which has had to axe hundreds of flights this week, said it would be pre-emptively cancelling a further 50 flights a day over the weekend to minimise disruption. Large numbers of crew remain sick with Covid, affecting services at Gatwick, Luton and Manchester. However, the airline said it would still be operating more flights than at any point since 2019 – about 1,600 a day, 300 more than in August 2021. A higher influx than normal of returning passengers, after last weekend’s outbound peak at the start of most UK schools holidays, could also test queues at immigration. A Home Office spokesperson said passengers “may face a longer wait time than usual due to a high number of passengers and as we ensure all passengers are compliant with the security and immigration measures put in place to keep us safe”. They added: “Border Force’s number one priority is to maintain a secure border, and we will not compromise on this. We are working closely with all UK ports and airports to ensure passengers have the smoothest possible journey, and we will continue to deploy our staff flexibly to manage this demand.” While some businesses such as Heathrow avoided direct compulsory redundancies among frontline staff during the pandemic, many people have left the sector in the last two years, and airports are rushing to catch up with renewed demand for travel after the UK lifted the last testing restrictions on 18 March. The Airline Operators Association said the surge was welcome but challenging, with staff shortages or absences at every stage of the journey. Its chief executive, Karen Dee, said: “It is great to see passengers return in large numbers after a prolonged period of near-complete shutdown. “Airports are putting all available staff on the frontline, including senior leadership and other people who normally work in different parts of the operation. This means that for most passengers, although the journey through the airport may be busy, airports are getting them away on their holidays safely.” The Port of Dover has warned of a further intensely busy period after much of the town was gridlocked last weekend as drivers sought to avoid queues for cross-Channel departures. Last weekend’s leisure traffic, with 30,000 departing passengers, was three times the level of a year ago, the port said. Operation Brock, the traffic management scheme to deal with post-Brexit congestion, remained in place on Thursday, closing a 23-mile stretch of the M20 towards Dover to park thousands of queueing lorries. P&O Ferries said it hoped to resume cross-Channel services at some point next week, when it hopes to have two of its four vessels based in Dover cleared to sail by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. One ship, the Pride of Kent, was detained last week due to concerns about the readiness of its new replacement crew, after the mass sackings last month. High winds have also affected some services in the past week, and freight shipping was halted at Southampton port on Thursday. The AA said holiday traffic on UK roads would peak on Good Friday, and 27.6m car journeys were expected over the Easter weekend. There will be some disruption for people seeking to travel by rail next weekend as extensive engineering work by Network Rail and HS2 will close the west coast mainline between London Euston and Milton Keynes.",News/UK news,Airlines and cross-Channel services brace for busiest weekend since Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/08/airlines-and-cross-channel-services-brace-for-busiest-weekend-since-covid
4/8/2022,"A stranded Greenland shark found off the coast of Cornwall died from meningitis, according to a postmortem, providing what is believed to be the first evidence of the disease in the species. The 4-metre long shark, thought to be about 100 years old, was first discovered by a dog walker on 13 March on a beach near Penzance but was washed back into the sea before it could be properly examined. After a two-day search it was discovered floating in the water off Newlyn harbour beach by a tourist boat and a postmortem was carried out. Greenland sharks live up to 2,600 metres below the surface of the Arctic and north Atlantic oceans. Pathologists believe meningitis explains why this female was out of her natural deep-water habitat. Her brain was slightly discoloured and congested with a cloudy fluid, which contained a type of bacteria called Pasteurella, likely to have caused the meningitis. It is not known how the shark got the infection. The last time a Greenland shark washed up in the UK was in Northumberland in 2013. The discovery of this specimen has given researchers an opportunity to study the planet’s longest-lived vertebrate species – some are thought to be more than 400 years old. Despite probably being born just after the first world war, this shark was still considered a juvenile. Females are thought to reach maturity at 150 years old, when they are about 4.2 metres long. “This unfortunate and extraordinary stranding has allowed us to get an insight into the life and death of a species we know little about,” said Rob Deaville from Zoological Society of London’s (ZSL) Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme (CSIP). “It’s almost certainly the oldest animal I’ve ever seen. “With only a small handful of Greenland shark strandings previously recorded in the UK, this likely represents the first necropsy ever carried out on this species in this country and was an exceptional opportunity to learn more about the life and death of this cryptic and endangered deep-water shark,” he said. Meningitis is caused by a viral or bacterial infection. The same Pasteurella bacteria has been found to cause meningitis in humans but it is extremely rare. Pathologists do not yet know what species of Pasteurella affected the shark and will investigate further. Meningitis has been described before in sharks but it is not known how widespread it is, said Deaville. He has seen a couple of beached basking sharks affected over the past decade, and it has also been reported in captive lemon sharks. The postmortem was carried out by the Cornwall marine pathology team, which is part of CSIP. Pathologists began with an external examination to look for a possible cause of death, such as net marks or parasites. Then they opened up the body to access the organs, examining each one for evidence of abnormalities. Samples were taken, documented, and sent for detailed analysis, looking, for instance, at diet, exposure to pollution and disease. Pathologist James Barnett, who carried out the postmortem with a team of volunteers, said: “The shark’s body was in poor condition and there were signs of a haemorrhage within the soft tissue around the pectoral fins which, coupled with the silt found in her stomach, suggested she may well have live stranded. “As far as we’re aware, this is one of the first postmortem examinations here in the UK of a Greenland shark and the first account of meningitis in this species.” The shark was dissected and body parts have been sent to research institutions around the country for examination. Research into its skin will examine the evolution of how the sharks swim. Its gastrointestinal tract will reveal if there are microplastics present, and scientists will look at other hard remains such as fish ear bones, or squid beaks, which could shed light on the shark’s diet. Toxicology tests on its liver could reveal what pollutants the shark was exposed to during its long life. Some samples, kept at -80C, are being sent to the Sanger Institute to have the whole genome sequenced as part of the Darwin Tree of Life project, where they could inform research on cancer and ageing. Greenland sharks are the only shark species hardy enough to spend all year in the the Arctic Ocean. Their very slow metabolism means they are well adapted to cold water, and may also explain their long lifespan. They grow less than 1cm a year, have a top speed of just 2.9km an hour and a heart that beats five or six times a minute. The largest specimen ever found was a 5-metre female between 272 and 512 years old. “I’ve been doing this job for 25 years and we get a lot of strandings, but I certainly wasn’t expecting a call about a Greenland shark on a Sunday afternoon – we were a bit dumbfounded,” said Deaville. “There is so much that is weird and wonderful about them.” Greenland sharks were once hunted for their liver oil but now many end up caught in fishing nets. The species is listed as vulnerable. CSIP has done postmortems on 4,500 cetaceans over 30 years, making it one of the world’s largest databases on strandings and causes of mortality. The stranded shark was spotted by Rosie Woodroffe, a biologist from ZSL, who was out walking her dog. “I thought immediately that it looked like a Greenland shark but, not being a shark expert, assumed I must be mistaken and reported it to the marine strandings network as a presumed basking shark.” When she got home she dug out a book on sharks and realised what she had found. “I can’t stop thinking about this Greenland shark, recovered dead from the sea this evening,” she later wrote on Twitter. “Even if she was ‘only’ just over 100 years old, she has shared the Earth with thylacines and passenger pigeons. She swam calmly in the deep ocean as wars raged above her.” CSIP urges anyone who spots a stranding to call the national hotline number on 0800 652 0333.

4/8/2022,"Dignity. It is fundamental to who we are and our place in society. One way to deprive people of the opportunity to lead dignified lives is to take away the means to meet their material needs. It is undignified to have to resort to food banks to feed your children; to wear two coats indoors against the cold; to plead against eviction because of an inability to pay the rent; to deny children a birthday party because of cost. The poorest people in the UK are about to experience a fresh wave of such indignities. These psycho-social assaults will be joined by the physical ill-effects of poverty. My life’s work has been studying the relationship between social conditions and inequalities in health. In the UK, a decade of austerity damaged public health and made health equity worse. But the cost of living crisis – and the chancellor’s failure to deal with it – is unprecedented, with its threats to the health and wellbeing of the nation. A 54% rise in the energy price cap will now mean an average household will pay £1,971 a year for gas and electricity, at the same time that council tax, water bills and car tax are all increasing. In October, a further rise pushing the annual energy bill up to £2,300 is expected. The typical working-age household will, according to the Resolution Foundation, experience a 4% fall in income, £1,100, in 2022-23. Surely, one might think, 4% is scarcely noticeable, hardly a matter of life and death? It is if you are on the margins. The Resolution Foundation gives the example of a single parent, with one child, working 20 hours a week at a low-to-medium wage. In September 2021, this person might have had an income of £18,265. The precipitate removal of the universal credit boost will have reduced income by £1,040. The cost of living rise to September 2022 will take another £1,198 off income. With the chancellor’s changes to taxes and allowances, and salary increases, this person’s income in September 2022 will be £17,681 – £584 less than it was a year earlier. (By contrast, a couple working full-time, both at the median wage, will see their net income fall by 1%, £392.) Inflation of more than 8%, and the government’s failure to deal with the cost of living crisis for the poorest people – an unemployed single person will see a 15% drop in income – will put an extra 1.3 million people, including 500,000 children, below the poverty line. When examining the effects on health and wellbeing because of this fall of income, there are at least three important considerations: the differential effects of losses as against gains; relative and absolute poverty; and the value provided to people by welfare and public services. If adding £500 to annual household income improves wellbeing, as the evidence shows, what does removing £500 do? According to Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky’s influential research, the negative effect of a loss, in general, is twice as great as the positive effect of a similar gain. It is of fleeting intellectual interest whether taking away a few houses and yachts from an oligarch damages his health and wellbeing more than giving him a billion or two improves it. Of much greater concern is what removing £584 a year does to the life of someone who is struggling to get by. An extra £10 a week could help a little – save for a few weeks and buy your child a new pair of trainers. Taking away £10 a week can mean not just the choice between heating and eating but doing without both. And that will be bad both physically and psychologically. A key insight is how much intellectual energy is involved in being poor. Scarcity – in the words of Sendhil Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir’s book, Why Having Too Little Means So Much – reduces intellectual bandwidth. If you have to worry about whether you have food for dinner that evening, and for the rent on Friday, you have little space to think about anything else. Such stress can permanently affect the development of your children. A related concept is that it is not bad choices that lead people to be poor, it is poverty that leads to “bad” choices. An abiding scientific and practical question is the health significance of absolute poverty – having insufficient money to meet one’s basic needs – as compared with relative poverty – being poor relative to other people. The easy answer is that both are vital to health. In our various reports, one of our six areas of recommendation was that everyone should have sufficient income to lead a healthy life. Income was not our only recommendation, but it relates intimately to several of the others: child development; adequate food and nutrition; and decent housing. Figures from the Food Foundation show that for households in the bottom 10% of household income to follow healthy eating guidance, they would have to spend 74% of their income on food. It is not ignorance or the inability to cook that is the problem. It is poverty. But relative income is important, too. Following Amartya Sen, relative inequalities in income relate to absolute inequalities in capabilities. An idea that goes back to Adam Smith is that the essentials of life include whatever is necessary to take your place in public without shame. This is about having agency, a sense of self-worth, and participating in networks of family and friends. Lack of income threatens these fundamental components of living in society, and damages mental and physical health. The third issue is captured by the movement for universal basic services. If public transport were free at the point of use, if social housing were available and affordable, home heating affordable, nutritious food available without a cost premium, then relative lack of individual income would be less harmful for health. In the UK, public services were cut dramatically, and in regressive fashion, by a decade of austerity. The failure of allocations to public services to rise in line with inflation in the recent spring statement will mean further pressures on public sector pay and on the provision of public services. In the decade before the pandemic, improvement in health in the UK slowed dramatically, inequalities increased, and health for the poorest people got worse. This was all amplified by the pandemic. Unless we deal with the inability of people to meet their basic needs, by adequate income and services, we are in danger of inflicting a humanitarian calamity in one of the richest countries in the world.

4/8/2022,"The children of refugees and asylum seekers are receiving lessons in hotel car parks in Manchester because no places have been found at local schools, charity workers say. Children thought to number in the hundreds, who have fled with their families from countries including Afghanistan, Sudan, Iraq and Syria, are being put up in hotels across the city by the Home Office while they await news about their asylum applications. Dr Rhetta Moran, a founder of the Manchester-based charity Refugee and Asylum Participatory Action Research (Rapar), said volunteers were giving the children lessons in the car park of a hotel where they are living. She is calling on Manchester city council – as well as outsourcing firm Serco, the company that has the Home Office contract for provision of accommodation in this part of the UK – to address the problem urgently. Moran said: “Many of these children have been victims of war and persecution. They have then endured traumatic journeys to get to the UK, and upon arrival they are faced with lengthy delays in our asylum and immigration system.” A resident of one Manchester hotel, who did not wish to be identified, told the Guardian there were about 30 children residing at the same premises as her, predominantly of Syrian, Afghan, Iraqi, Yemeni and Sudanese origin, and that some have faced waits of at least six months for a school place. “They have two hours of formal ‘Esol’ English lessons per week,” she said. “But it often falls to just one or two teachers to coordinate learning for children of many different nationalities, ages, backgrounds and levels – sometimes adults too.” She said the learning taking place in makeshift car park classrooms was “very unstructured, with a combination of volunteers and residents taking the reins”, but also “very necessary for children who are at a crucial stage in their development”. Another resident at the same hotel added: “Sometimes it’s just a case of them doing some supervised maths on the ground in chalk, or residents sharing their skills such as art or sewing. It’s informal, but the children are bored and unstimulated without it. Plus it’s good for them to build their social skills via interactions with other kids.” Moran, who has worked with asylum seekers in Manchester for two decades, said children were being failed by the system, adding: “Parents arriving with children are being asked to fill out forms naming three possible schools for their child to attend in the area – a near impossible task for someone new to the country whose English might not be strong. “It often falls to charity volunteers to assist with the completion of these forms, which are then sent to the city council for processing.” Madeleine Summerfield, a volunteer for the charity Care4Calais and hotel lead for a premises elsewhere in Manchester, said resources were stretched for young asylum seekers and refugees across the region. The volume of people and availability of space differed for every hotel and between city councils, she said, with some focusing on Afghan refugees, some on Ukrainians, and others on “mixed” asylum seekers. Summerfield added: “Conflicts between local and national policy can make things difficult, but ultimately the focus should be on ensuring all the children are educated and have the opportunity to integrate.” A Manchester city council spokesperson said: “All staff in hotels where families are placed have had guidance shared with them about applying for a school place in Manchester and are aware of the need to apply for a place to access a local school. They also have a direct link into the education service in Manchester. “This academic year alone, the council has placed more than 400 refugee and asylum seeker children in schools and colleges. This has included commissioning places in secondary schools outside Manchester where there were not sufficient places in their local area.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We must do all we can to welcome refugees who arrive in this country having been forced to flee their homes due to conflict. We expect every school-aged child arriving here to begin attending school shortly afterwards. “We believe that the best place for all children to be educated is in schools and attendance will help children integrate into the communities in which they are living.”",News/Education,Refugee pupils with no school places have lessons in Manchester car parks,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/08/refugee-pupils-no-school-places-lessons-manchester-car-parks
4/8/2022,"How quaint it feels now to look back on the sort of low-level furore with which JK Rowling once had to contend. In 2009, Matt Latimer, a former speech writer for George W Bush, claimed in his book Speech-less: Tales of a White House Survivor that the Harry Potter creator had been dropped from consideration for the presidential medal of freedom because of suspicions in the administration that her books “encouraged witchcraft”. What the Wizarding World wouldn’t give today for a controversy of that stripe: one that doesn’t result in lost revenue, accusations of hate speech, and the previously unimaginable spectacle of Vladimir Putin declaring that he knows how Rowling feels. It is in this volatile climate that Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore, the third in the Harry Potter spin-off series, is being released. The movie begins with the dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (played by Mads Mikkelsen) slinking into a tearoom, his nose twitching. “Can you smell it?” he hisses. “The stench?” He is referring to the aroma of the muggles – non-magic folk, that is – seated all around him, but anyone who has been paying attention to the fortunes of the once-invulnerable Wizarding World would be forgiven for reading the line as a commentary on the franchise itself. Rather like the fantastic beasts catalogued by the magizoologist Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne), the problems facing the series come in assorted shapes and sizes. One of its stars, Johnny Depp, who played Grindelwald at the end of the first Fantastic Beasts film and throughout the second, was asked to leave by Warner Bros after losing his libel case against the Sun newspaper, which had referred to him as a “wife-beater” following accusations of domestic violence made against him by his ex-wife Amber Heard. Two years ago, another of the film’s stars, Ezra Miller, was videoed grabbing a woman by the throat in a bar in Reykjavik. Last week, the non-binary actor was arrested for disorderly conduct in a Hawaii karaoke bar; reports from the same night allege that they burst into a private residence and threatened the couple living there. This all feels like small beer compared with the controversy that has swirled around Rowling over the past few years, ever since a long essay she wrote about her gender-critical feminism put her at the centre of the row about trans rights. The world of Harry Potter and its Fantastic Beasts spin-offs has undoubtedly been marred by this. The question now is whether the damage is irrevocable, and even severe enough to kill off future projects. Anna Smith, a film critic and host of the podcast Girls on Film, concedes that the franchise has taken a few knocks. “The fact that both these things have happened to people involved in Fantastic Beasts has cast a bit of a pall over the series for some audiences,” she says. “I’m not sure they will prove catastrophic, however. There are probably enough people keen on the series who don’t know, or care, what Film Twitter is saying.” The novelist Joanna Nadin, who has written more than 90 books for children and adults including the bestselling Worst Class in the World series, believes the significance of Rowling’s comments is far more wide-reaching than that. “It isn’t just Film Twitter or even YA Twitter,” she says. “These conversations go on among young people whenever the books or films are mentioned. She has tarnished her own brand as far as huge numbers of them are concerned.” For evidence, check out the online response to Emma Watson’s appearance on stage at last month’s Bafta ceremony, where the actor amplified her previously stated message of support for the trans community by telling an appreciative audience: “I’m here for all of the witches.” “The reason Emma Watson’s Bafta comment went viral is because this isn’t a limited issue,” says Nadin. “This is something millions of people are invested in. The young people I’ve worked with in the last five years, many of whom are trans, feel betrayed by someone who was a guiding light to them, who gave them a place to feel safe, where ‘difference’ was celebrated. Now we don’t use Rowling’s name or work in the classroom.” Even before its current travails, there was a rinky-dink quality to the Fantastic Beasts franchise. From one angle, the idea of announcing a five-film cycle at the get-go felt like a mark of hubris (if we’re being grand about it) or an act of cynical exploitation (if we’re not). Rowling published the Harry Potter spin-off book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them in 2001 to raise money for Comic Relief. Once the initial film, for which she received her first solo screenwriting credit, reached cinemas, it was not altogether clear that there was enough material for a single movie, let alone the other four that she had promised (or threatened, depending on your point of view). Extrapolating a threadbare story from what was originally a slim encyclopaedia of outlandish creatures had resulted in something very close to a two-hour game of Pokémon Go. Released in 2016, the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them movie contained pluses – including fine, intense work from Samantha Morton as an anti-magic preacher and Miller as her troubled son, Credence – but one distinct minus was Redmayne, whose mannered, ingratiating performance made Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump look like a study in Bressonian realism. Eyes darting diffidently, mouth semi-agape in a love-me pout, he seemed to be channelling Michael Crawford in Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em. The reviews were generally kind, though, with audiences even kinder: the film grossed $814m worldwide (on a budget of $180m). But by the time the second movie, subtitled The Crimes of Grindelwald, rolled around two years later, the tenor had changed. The trade paper Variety declared that “real magic is in short supply”; the Telegraph diagnosed “one of the gravest cases of prequel-itis since Star Wars: The Phantom Menace”; and the Financial Times dismissed the picture as “a fatigued special effects show”, advising the film-makers to “abort any thought of Fantastic Beasts 3”. The budget for the second movie had risen to $200m but the international box-office was down to $654m. Not yet calamitous, perhaps, but cause for concern – and a sign that the Harrymoon was over. And the pre-release box office estimates suggest that Dumbledore will take at less than half of Grindelwald. What has changed in the interim? Moviegoers have certainly started to react more strongly to the suspicion that they’re being sold a pup, as proved by the audience exodus from the Divergent franchise (the third episode, Allegiant, tanked so badly that a proposed fourth was scrapped), as well as the decline in enthusiasm for the rebooted Terminator series, where the subtitle of the final one – Dark Fate – said it all. Could it be that the days of flogging a dead franchise are numbered, now that audiences not only have so many other viewing options, but such an array of platforms on which to make their displeasure felt? Disney’s approach to Star Wars illustrated that no movie cycle is too big to fail. The studio came a cropper in 2018 with Solo: A Star Wars Story, which became, as Vanity Fair put it at the time, “officially the first Star Wars movie to flop”. Two years later, the Disney CEO, Bob Iger, shouldered responsibility. “I think the mistake that I made – I take the blame – was a little too much, too fast,” he told the Hollywood Reporter, before confirming that “you can expect some slowdown”. The most deleterious effect on the Wizarding World has been caused not so much by lacklustre product – Fantastic Beasts still has fans in abundance – but by Rowling herself. Warner Bros appeared to acknowledge as much when it issued a Secrets of Dumbledore trailer last year in which her name was invisible to the naked eye. Previous trailers had put the novelist front and centre; the first Fantastic Beasts trailer included a title card dominated by her name (“JK Rowling invites you”) while The Crimes of Grindelwald featured one announcing the new film “from writer JK Rowling”. When it came time to whet appetites for the third episode, she had become the dirty secret in The Secrets of Dumbledore, relegated to the small print at the bottom of the screen. That move seemed consistent with last year’s reunion special, Harry Potter 20th Anniversary: Return to Hogwarts, which included no new interview footage from Rowling. Screen time went instead to the stars of the original franchise: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, all of whom had already distanced themselves publicly from Rowling, and declared their solidarity with the trans community. Redmayne, too, was vocal in his opposition to her views. “I disagree with Jo’s comments,” he said in 2020. “Trans women are women, trans men are men, and non-binary identities are valid.” When you’ve got the stars of your own franchise lining up to contradict you, and Putin trying to align himself with your travails at the height of his hostilities against Ukraine (he compared the west’s attempts to “cancel” Russia, as he put it, with the treatment of Rowling by “fans of so-called gender freedoms”) then some kind of cosmic recalibration must surely be in order. Even those who remain entirely sympathetic to Rowling can’t fail to acknowledge that it is she who is preventing the smooth continuation of the Wizarding World. To use horror movie parlance, the call is coming from inside the house. Regardless of the Rowling controversy, The Secrets of Dumbledore looks unlikely to bring about any miraculous upswing in the franchise’s standing. Common criticisms that the second movie was all world-building and no characterisation, or that Rowling had cluttered up the first two films with obfuscatory detail, seemed to hit home: for this third one, Steve Kloves, who scripted the entire Harry Potter series, is credited as co-writer. A steadier hand on the tiller would be hard to find, though it hasn’t resulted in an improved viewing experience. The new film feels simultaneously leaden and inconsequential, lacking the depth, clarity or calibre of ideas to justify a two-and-a-half-hour screen time. The good news for Warner Bros is that the Harry Potter brand, distinct from Fantastic Beasts, appears insulated from retroactive harm. Interest in the original property shows no sign of waning, even among those fans who have abandoned their allegiance to Rowling. The stage hit Harry Potter and the Cursed Child continues to dominate Broadway and the West End, while last summer’s reunion documentary went down a storm on HBO Max, where a live-action Harry Potter spin-off series is in the early planning stages. “It’s interesting to see the generation who grew up with the books and films ‘owning’ them now,” says Nadin. “They’re able to say: ‘These belong to us, not her’ and remove her from the picture, which is, I think, a healthy attitude.” But while Harry Potter seems ringfenced by the goodwill of loyal fans, the future of Fantastic Beasts is less certain. David Yates, who has directed every Wizarding World movie since Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix in 2007, confirmed recently that Rowling hasn’t yet started work on the fourth script in the series. Holding fire on that first draft until the takings are in for The Secrets of Dumbledore seems prudent. Unless any graduates of Hogwarts know of a spell suitable for laundering a sullied film franchise, this is a beast that may yet be put out of its misery.  Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore is released on 7 April in Australia, 8 April in the UK, and 15 April in the US.",Arts/Film,Fantastic Beasts and where to cancel them: how the Wizarding World lost its magic,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/08/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-cancel-them-how-the-wizarding-world-lost-its-magic
4/8/2022,"The French aerospace company Gama has raised €2m to deploy a solar sail in space. Solar sails require no engines to move. Instead, they are pushed around by the pressure of sunlight. The angle of the sail determines the direction of motion. Gama plans to deploy a 73.3-sq-metre solar sail in a 550km-altitude orbit in October. It will be launched as an additional payload on a SpaceX rocket. There have been a number of previous solar sail deployment tests by Nasa and the American space advocacy group the Planetary Society. However, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency had been the only organisation to successfully sail on sunlight. In 2010 it used a solar sail to power the experimental Ikaros (Interplanetary Kite-craft Accelerated by Radiation of the Sun) spacecraft to Venus. Gama hopes to demonstrate that solar sails can revolutionise access to deep space because they are cost-effective and scalable in size. After this year’s deployment test, the company plans to launch a follow-up mission in 2024 to a higher orbit to demonstrate control and onboard navigation. In 2025, it hopes to emulate the Japanese and fly to Venus. Since solar sails are incapable of running out of fuel, they can help reduce the risk of space debris.",News/Science,Spacewatch: French firm raises €2m to sail on sunlight,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/08/french-aerospace-firm-gama-sail-sunlight-solar-space
4/8/2022,"Atmospheric levels of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, increased by a record amount for the second year in a row in 2021, according to US government data. The concentration of methane in the Earth’s atmosphere jumped by 17 parts per billion (ppb) in 2021, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa) monitoring found, the largest annual increase recorded since modern measurements began in 1983. The previous record increase, of 15.3ppb, was set in 2020. While carbon dioxide emitted from the burning of fossil fuels can linger in the atmosphere and contribute towards global heating for generations, methane is far shorter lived. Methane, however, is also far more potent as a greenhouse gas: it is 25 times more powerful at trapping heat and acts as a significant short-term driver of the climate crisis. Climate activists say that methane is a “blow torch” to the climate, compared with the gradual boil provided by CO2. Rapid cuts in methane could help curb disastrous global heating, according to scientists, but the record increases in methane suggest it is being leaked from oil and gas drilling operations and released from agriculture at dangerous rates. “Our data show that global emissions continue to move in the wrong direction at a rapid pace,” said Rick Spinrad, administrator of Noaa. “The evidence is consistent, alarming, and undeniable.” Methane comes from a variety of sources, from the decay of organic matter in wetlands to the burps of cows, and it is uncertain what exactly is behind the large increases in emissions. Noaa said, however, that about a third of emissions can be attributed to the fossil fuel industry, which leaks and burns off large quantities of methane when drilling for oil and gas. According to a powerful UN climate report released this week, methane emissions must be cut by a third if the world is to avoid catastrophic temperature increases. Scientists say that as much as 0.3C of global temperature rise could be averted if methane emissions were slashed. “Reducing methane emissions is an important tool we can use right now to lessen the impacts of climate change in the near term, and reduce the rate of warming,” said Spinrad. Climate campaigners said the “alarming” increases in methane emissions should prompt swift action to plug methane leaks. “Polluters’ record profits must be used to properly seal and remediate every well and fix every methane leak,” said Kassie Siegel, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute. “But methane reductions have to be one part of a transformative global effort to phase out deadly fossil fuels in favor of truly clean renewable energy. Anything less puts us on a catastrophic path to an unrecognizable world.”",News/Environment,"Methane in Earth’s atmosphere rose by record amount last year, US government data shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/08/methane-earth-atmosphere-record-high-usa-government-data
4/8/2022,"There’s the flicker of kingcup yellow on the puddled mud. A low disturbance in a raft of watercress in front of the Big House. A sleek paper dart of a bird appears, arrowing in undulations, lemon-yellow belly reflecting up at itself. It pauses on a clod. It’s slim, elegant, poised as a jewellery-box ballerina, dancing to the tune of its wagging tail. To me, this is “Polly Dishwash”, the grey wagtail: at least half yellow, but not as yellow as the yellow wagtail. Riddle me that one, my grandad would say. He taught me that a grey wagtail – a “water wagtail” – was a sign of a good, clean place to stop. He would take my brother, cousins and I on long walks over a different chalk hill than the one I live below now: Portsdown Hill in Portsmouth, and to the ford of another chalk stream, where he’d say: “Look for the Washerwoman! Find Polly Dishwash [sometimes Molly Washdish] and we’ll stop there.” We always saw “her” making little flamenco feints after midges. We’d eat an apple, some thick and sticky homemade coconut ice, pull some green wheat stalks from the fields, nibble the soft milky grains, and dip a tin cup into the clear water and drink. Imagine what chemicals, in the 1970s and 80s! Sometimes we’d pick wet, peppery watercress and eat it between slices of white bread. I know now that our “stopping place” (I remember the Romany words atchin tan that I thought he’d made up) must have had a different significance for him: a reference to some traditions, superstitions and Gypsy lore passed down by his grandmother, who perhaps didn’t need to distance herself from her heritage, as he or his mother did. The wagtail dances on. A flash of sink-side rubber-glove lemon; of sparkling water and sudsy glasses; washing up-scented memories of coconut ice, singing and a tea towel flipped over a shoulder. I wonder how many others make those kinds of associations. I think to myself: “Oke Romano chiriklo, dikasa e Kalen!” – see a wagtail (though usually a pied one), soon see a Gypsy! There is no one about. But I look down at my reflection in the water, and smile.

4/8/2022,"For many of my friends and neighbours in Kabul, cricket was the only reason to know Australia.It was like that across Afghanistan for decades until the 2020 revelation of alleged war crimes by the Aussies in Uruzgan province, and now the Morrison government’s announcement of 16,500 extra humanitarian visas for Afghan refugees. When I look now at how my war-ravaged countrymen and women view the Aussies, I see despair and anger next to a ray of hope. It’s shaped by this relatively new love-hate relationship, despite lesser known deep-rooted ties between the two nations – there were legendary Afghan cameleers in Australia in the 18th and 19th centuries such as “the Wonder Man” Mahomet Allum and the poster boy Monga Khan. Despite all the recent, mostly bad things dominating Afghan-Australian relations, the affection for Australian cricketers has been growing in Afghanistan, while emerging Afghan stars such as Rashid Khan, Mohammad Nabi and Zahir Khan are becoming household names in Australia because of the Big Bash League. Still, the scars left by the alleged war crimes by the Australia defence force in Uruzgan are fresh and unforgettable, and may not be healed if justice keeps being delayed, regardless of the offer of a safe haven for the thousands of vulnerable Afghans. The Australian government’s announcement last week of thousands of new visas for Afghan refugees appears generous. But it is contrasted with a lack of recognition of the many generations of Afghans who have dedicated their lives to this continent since the time of the cameleers, and calls for some soul searching. What does this say about the nature of this love-hate relationship between Aussie Afghans and the powerful Australian state throughout history? Why isn’t there the bonding, recognition and mutual respect between Afghanistan and Australia after so many years? When I was covering the war and the human suffering in Afghanistan, I noted Australia’s 20 years of military presence in Afghanistan was overshadowed by other Nato allies such as the US, Germany and the UK, which had larger missions and were publicly more engaged in reconstruction and humanitarian activities. This was despite the sacrifices of 41 Australian soldiers and deployment of 30,000 defence personnel during the two decades of conflict before the Taliban’s resurgence to power last year. Now, on the heels of a haphazard rush towards the exit, the US seems busy with face-saving moves, such as freezing Afghanistan’s state reserves worth billions of dollars for the propagated purpose of pressuring the Taliban to comply. The Australian government has a chance to chalk out its own post-war strategy tailored to its future ties with the Afghans instead of hiding in Washington’s shadow. The announcement of 16,500 visas slots is indeed a first step in the right direction to revive and strengthen the forgotten bonds between the two nations. This window of opportunity to shape the future of multiculturalism in Australia and patch ties with this geopolitically important country in the heart of Asia should not be overlooked. Another thing to watch for is the influence of domestic Australian politics on the seemingly generous and open-hearted sentiments of Australians towards Afghanistan (I am speaking from my three months of experience here so far). There are lessons to be learned on this from the messy ways in which the Democrats and the Republicans in Washington shaped the endgame in Afghanistan in August 2021, when two decades of efforts for democratisation failed with the return of the Taliban. The way an elected Afghan government was ditched by the US in the Doha Agreement gave a nasty signal of mistrust to Washington’s allies around the world. Here in Australia, a vibrant Afghan community is already living in harmony with its new Aussie identity. The influx of more Afghans, which is crucial in reuniting families like mine torn apart by the war, would complement the diversity of this beautiful land. Australia can win hearts with very little investment of funds in Afghanistan – by not cherrypicking for its own needs, but also for the welfare of the war-torn nation. Visas are welcome, but the Australian government should think about doing more, such as regular scholarships for bright Afghan students, skills training, market access for farmers, and of course the promotion of cricket in the mountainous country.
