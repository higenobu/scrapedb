5/18/2022,"Executives from Australia’s largest homebuilder, Metricon, will meet with the Victorian treasurer, Tim Pallas, on Thursday morning amid rumours sweeping the construction industry that the company is on the verge of collapse. Metricon holds $195m worth of contracts with the state government, including a five-year deal to build and maintain public housing as part of Victoria’s ambitious “big build” infrastructure program. Sources said Metricon requested the meeting late last week but it was pushed back several days after the unexpected death this week of the company’s founder and chief executive, Mario Biasin. If the company collapses, insolvency practitioners from KordaMentha are likely to be appointed as administrators. The chief executive of Master Builders Victoria (MBV), Rebecca Casson, said the industry association was “aware that there are rumours about the future of Metricon”. “We are in close contact with them, and we are very optimistic about the company’s future,” she said. “It is incumbent on everyone not to join in with the rumour narrative, especially during this incredibly challenging time. “We also encourage Metricon’s clients and suppliers to be kind and patient with them as they navigate through these unprecedented challenges.” Metricon and the Victorian government have been contacted for comment. In a statement released on Tuesday, Metricon’s acting chief executive, Peter Langfelder, said the company aimed to continue business as usual after Biasin’s death. “We are committed to continuing to run the Metricon business as usual during this sad time,” he said. “We are very much appreciative of the kind messages of support from our business partners, suppliers, trades, contractors, government agencies and finance partners.” Building industry sources said Metricon, along with other large-scale homebuilders, reaped large amounts of work due to the federal government’s Homebuilder program, which was designed to prop up the industry during the Covid pandemic.

The price of timber rose by more than 25% in the year to March, while steel products were up almost 50% over the same period, MBV said. Builders have been pushing for Victorian law to be changed to allow them to pass on increased materials costs to customers, but this has been rejected by the Andrews government. Metricon’s projects include a contract for its “Everyone” division to build 115 homes as part of Victoria’s Social Housing Pipeline Project, which was due to be completed last year. As part of a $2.6bn package designed to respond to the housing crisis, the Social Housing Pipeline Project was expanded in March to add 913 homes. It is not clear whether Metricon was part of this expansion. Through Everyone, Metricon is also involved in building public housing for the Queensland and New South Wales state governments. It is the largest homebuilder in Australia, with 6,052 homes under construction in 2020-21. So far this financial year it has undertaken 1,006 home construction jobs in Queensland alone, worth more than $400m, according to Queensland Building and Construction Commission records. It completed 1,563 jobs in Queensland in 2020-21, more than double the 668 it built in the previous year.  In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

5/18/2022,"The parents of a teenager killed by an allergic reaction to a Pret a Manger sandwich say a clinical trial launched in her name “would have meant everything to her”. The trial will investigate whether peanut and milk products can be used under medical supervision as a treatment to improve tolerance. Announcing it, Tanya and Nadim Ednan-Laperouse, said their aim was to “make food allergies history”. Their daughter, Natasha, was 15 when she died in 2016 after a severe allergic reaction to a Pret baguette that contained sesame. Under the law at the time, the sandwich did not require an allergy label as it had been made on site. The three-year oral immunotherapy trial will be led by the University of Southampton and University hospital Southampton NHS foundation trust. It was funded by the Natasha Allergy Research Foundation. Tanya Ednan-Laperouse told BBC Breakfast on Wednesday: “If Natasha was alive today and she knew what was happening, that there was a clinical trial in her name, it would have meant everything to her. “And I think knowing that there was research happening, looking into solutions and looking into treatments so that she could live a less stressed life around the food that she was eating would have been enormous for her.” Nadim Ednan-Laperouse said: “She’s in heaven now. She’s looking down and she’s saying: ‘Yes mummy and daddy. Fantastic. Let’s do this.’” Natasha’s parents have campaigned to make life safer for those with allergies since their daughter’s death. A food safety law, known as “Natasha’s Law” was introduced in October 2021 to compel all food made on premises to have full ingredient and allergen labelling. The NHS already uses a drug called Palforzia, a powder manufactured from peanuts, to build tolerance over time in a monthly dose. The trial will look at whether everyday foods can be used instead of costly medicines to provide treatment for thousands of people with allergies. The study will recruit 216 children and young adults with allergies to cow’s milk and peanuts. After an initial 12 months of desensitisation under strict medical supervision, those taking part will be followed for two more years to provide longer-term data. Nadim Ednan-Laperouse said: “This is a major first step in our mission to make food allergies history. The aim is to save lives and prevent serious hospitalisations by offering lifelong protection against severe allergic reactions to foods.” The study aims to plug the current oral immunotherapy research gap by proving that everyday foods can be used as a practical treatment for children and young adults with allergies at a fraction of the cost to the NHS. He said that, if successful, “it would enable people, once desensitised under clinical supervision, to control their own lives and stay allergy safe using shop bought foods rather than expensive pharmaceutical products”. Several hospitals across the UK are taking part, including Imperial College London, the University hospitals of Leicester NHS trust, Newcastle University and Sheffield Children’s hospital. Dr Paul Turner, reader in paediatric allergy and clinical immunology at Imperial College London, said: “This study heralds a new era for the active treatment of food allergy. “For too long, we have told people just to avoid the food they are allergic to. That is not a treatment, and food-allergic people and their families deserve better.”",News/Society,Parents of girl who died after eating Pret sandwich launch food allergy study ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/18/pret-sandwich-death-natasha-ednan-laperouse-parents-launch-food-allergy-study
5/18/2022,"We’ve heard of doorstop press conferences, but today Scott Morrison got window-stopped. Anthony Albanese made a pitch to voters with a set-piece address to the National Press Club in Canberra. And the latest wages data fuelled the debate about real pay cuts. Three sleeps to go: here’s how Wednesday unfolded. By Paul Karp Scott Morrison’s first event on Wednesday was another new home-build, this time in Armstrong Creek south of Geelong, in the Labor-held marginal seat of Corangamite in Victoria. It’s a familiar formula now: new homes, carefully selected first-homebuyers or those aspiring to be, some chit chat in the kitchen about fixing your interest rates and getting your hands on your super for a deposit. At the presser, Morrison confirmed that the petrol tax of 22 cents a litre will go back to 44 cents after six months despite prices nudging $2 a litre again; and conceded that the Reserve Bank of Australia doesn’t project real wage growth (where wages outpace inflation) until the end of 2023. After dodging one pandemic question from the Saturday Paper, Morrison took one from Guardian Australia, delivered from out the home’s window. The Guardian’s @Paul_Karp asks the hard hitting questions while hanging out a window. Marvellous stuff and made me chuckle. #ausvotes pic.twitter.com/BxLDhov4eN @Paul_Karp with what could be the first question out a window. #auspol #ausvotes pic.twitter.com/85aM7OX6Zx The unexpected location was necessary because Morrison had begun by taking questions from his right but skipped the Guardian. A mid-press conference move to the window gave me the element of surprise by bobbing up on Morrison’s left. In response to the window question, Morrison consulted notes to rattle off Covid statistics – he was prepared, apparently, for a gotcha question. In the afternoon, Morrison addressed the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce, continuing his theme that the government is “putting this pandemic behind us”. It was at his last stop that he produced one of the most memorable campaign moments. In the evening, Morrison attended Devonport Strikers football club in the Tasmanian seat of Braddon, promoting a $3.5m grant and accidentally bowling over a small child. The PM just accidentally bowled over a kid while playing soccer in Tassie. @9NewsAUS pic.twitter.com/WhUAZHWpr9 By Josh Butler About 24 hours after his last public appointment ended on Tuesday morning – with the click of a door closing behind him as he left a press conference in Perth, tailed by TV cameras – Albanese took the stage for an 80-minute set-piece speech and questions and answers at the National Press Club in Canberra. The venue’s chef, famous for tailoring menus to the speaker, referenced an Albanese social media deep cut with his main course, calling back to his lockdown dinner of steak, peas and corn. Lunch at the Press Club today “Albomp’s famous steak dinner”. The Labor leader is today’s key speaker. pic.twitter.com/7N6kSKL5Nh A missed opportunity for an Albanese favourite Viennetta dessert, but you can’t win them all. The National Press Club president, Laura Tingle, noted the (so far) absence of Scott Morrison, as she pointedly said at the speech’s commencement that “prime minister Scott Morrison becomes the first prime minister in more than 50 years to not give” a traditional pre-election speech to the venue. Albanese took questions across a range of topics, and brushed off the costings saga of the previous day (Labor will be releasing the costings on Thursday – the same timing as the then Tony Abbott-led opposition before the Coalition won the 2013 election). He argued he would not take lectures from “a desperate government” that had “spent $1bn on advertising themselves, including how good they are on climate”. “All of this nonsense about costings – we will be fair dinkum, as we have been the whole way through. But what you won’t see from us is the waste and the rorts. It’s got to end. It’s got to end and we’ve got to prioritise growing the economy and productivity,” Albanese said. The Albanese campaign headed to Sydney, ahead of a speech he will give tonight to the Marconi Club in the city’s west. Covid strategy: Scott Morrison brushed off the need for further measures to curtail Australia’s ongoing high rates of Covid-19 transmission and deaths, and suggested many Australians are dying with, not of, Covid. Morrison told reporters on Wednesday medical advice does not currently support a fourth Covid vaccine for the general population and asserted, without evidence, that Labor under Anthony Albanese may return to lockdowns to combat Covid. Reset?: China will seek talks with whichever party wins Saturday’s Australian federal election, with diplomats saying they see “a good opportunity” to ease tensions in the period after the vote. A Chinese diplomatic source, who did not wish to be named, said China was “genuine in our wish to improve the relationship” with Australia – although to date it has not publicly detailed any specific actions it is willing to take. Icac warning: Thirty-one retired judges have issued a pre-election plea to Australia’s political leaders to urgently establish a strong anti-corruption commission, warning it is critical in reversing the “serious erosion of our shared democratic principles”. In a letter sent to Scott Morrison, Anthony Albanese and the leaders of the Greens, One Nation and the United Australia party on Wednesday, the judges say the case for an effective national integrity commission “remains impregnable”. Sport grants: A rural sporting club that missed out on funding amid the infamous 2019 “sports rorts” grants now fears it is “being used” for political gain after the Nationals MP, Anne Webster, promised it funding if the Coalition is re-elected. A federal grant application for Nhill and District Sporting Club, in the Wimmera region of western Victoria, had scored a high level 82 out of 100. Yet their community was passed over by the Coalition in favour of lower scoring applications, some of which were in marginal metropolitan seats.

5/18/2022,"Ludwig Wittgenstein joined the army the day after his native Austria-Hungary declared war on Russia in August 1914. He had been serving for almost three months when he received word that his brother Paul, a concert pianist, had lost his right arm in battle. “Again and again,” he wrote in his notebook, “I have to think of poor Paul, who has so suddenly been deprived of his vocation! How terrible! What philosophical outlook would it take to overcome such a thing? Can it even happen except through suicide!” Wittgenstein was an unusual philosopher. He became obsessed with the foundations of logic while an engineering student and presented himself to Bertrand Russell in Cambridge, ready to solve all its problems. His intent was to provide an account of logic that was free from paradox and his solution came in the form of the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, sent to Russell from the Italian prisoner-of-war camp in which Wittgenstein was held at the end of the first world war. The Tractatus is written as a series of numbered propositions, closer in form to modernist poetry than philosophical treatise. Its central ideas can be traced back to the notebooks Wittgenstein kept during the early years of the conflict. The right-hand side of each spread was used to set out his evolving thoughts on logic and language. The left-hand side was saved for his personal notes, written in a simple code in which the letters of the alphabet were reversed (Z = A, and so on). It is these private remarks that are published in English here for the first time, edited and translated by Marjorie Perloff. They range from complaints about the other soldiers – “a bunch of swine! No enthusiasm for anything, unbelievable crudity, stupidity & malice!” – to the number of times he masturbates (“Yesterday, for the first time in 3 weeks”). He recounts his depression – “like a stone it presses on my chest. Every duty turns into an unbearable burden” – and his living conditions. These are accompanied by constant updates on how his work is going. And by “work”, he always means philosophy. “Remember how great the blessing of work is!” he writes. This work is the focus; the war, a backdrop. Wittgenstein’s solution to the problems of logic was largely in place by 1916. And had his contribution to philosophy ended there, the Tractatus might be unknown beyond that particular sub-field. But the book ends with a series of puzzling remarks on ethics, value and the meaning of life – remarks that Wittgenstein thought central to his project but which both confused and frustrated his first readers. It is here that the Notebooks tantalise. For in the material on the left-hand pages Wittgenstein first begins to reflect on the inner self, on God’s presence in the world, on what is required for life to make sense. It can sometimes seem irrelevant to the discussion of logic taking place on the right-hand side. “Have thought a great deal about all sorts of things,” he writes, “but curiously enough cannot establish their connection to my mathematical train of thought.” And then in 1916, facing death on the frontline, the connection is forged. Paradox in logic arises when you try to say those things that can only be shown. But that applies equally to God, the self and meaning. As he writes on a left-hand page, “What cannot be said, cannot be said”. The purview of ethics, like the purview of logic, lies outside the realm of what can be stated in language. And thus we get to the seventh and final statement of the Tractatus: whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent. For those who know the Tractatus, there is some interest in seeing how concerns that start life among the personal remarks slowly drift over to the facing page. For those who do not care about these details, there is interest in seeing first-hand the obsessive focus of a philosophical genius – one who thinks constantly about his work, even under enemy fire. When he writes of “laying siege”, it is to philosophical problems; when he wants to “spill [his] blood before this fortress”, it is in the context of logic. Even the masturbation is hard to separate from the philosophy: it happens when work is going well. For Wittgenstein, it seems, masturbation and philosophy are both expressions of living in the face of death. Perloff sees allusion to sexual affairs in some of Wittgenstein’s taciturn remarks. He records evening visits to the baths in Kraków and notes, somewhat matter-of-factly at the start of a new year, that “my moral standing is now much lower than it was at Easter”. More affecting is his unambiguous love and desire for his Cambridge friend David Pinsent. “A letter from David!! I kissed it. Answered right away.” Pinsent didn’t survive the war. He was a test pilot in Farnborough and died in an accident in May 1918. The Tractatus – one of the most significant works in 20th-century philosophy – is dedicated to his memory.

5/18/2022,"Hungary’s nationalist leader, Viktor Orbán, will be the star speaker at an extraordinary session of America’s Conservative Political Action Conference (Cpac) to be held in Hungary this week, in an effort to cement bonds between the radical right on both sides of the Atlantic under the banner of the “great replacement” ideology. In a speech on Monday, Orbán made explicit reference to the ideology, which claims there is a liberal plot to dilute the white populations of the US and European countries through immigration. Increasingly widespread among US Republicans, the creed was cited by the killer who opened fire on Saturday in a supermarket in a predominantly black area of Buffalo, New York. Speaking in Buffalo on Tuesday, Joe Biden called it a “perverse ideology” and “a lie”. “I call on all Americans to reject the lie. I condemn those who spread the lie for power, political gain and for profit,” Biden said. “We’ve now seen too many times the deadly and destructive violence this ideology unleashes.” Orbán argued this week that the western world was “committing suicide” through immigration. “I see the great European population exchange as a suicidal attempt to replace the lack of European, Christian children with adults from other civilizations – migrants,” Orbán declared in a speech to mark the start of his fourth term in office. Echoing another popular theme on the American right, he argued that another form of cultural suicide was “gender madness”, a reference to the spread of LGBTQ+ rights in the west. The prime minister’s choice of vocabulary was not accidental, Hungarian political analysts said, but was rather designed to underline the common ties between his Fidesz party, his self-described “illiberal” form of government, and the American visitors arriving in Budapest for the first ever Cpac meeting in Europe. “I think it is logical that he was signaling to US conservatives because of the upcoming Cpac,” said Zoltán Lakner, a political analyst, and editor-in-chief of the Jelen news outlet. “He is trying to define himself as a global political actor, and at this point, he has kind of achieved that goal.” ​​One of the speakers of the event, Balazs Orbán, the prime minister’s political director, told the Guardian that “there are political forces in every country that see the world the same way” as Hungary does, but he said the US right wing have showed exceptional encouragement. “American conservatives are very supportive of us because they can see that we have huge domestic support and because they see Hungary as a conservative safe space,” Balazs Orbán said. Alongside prominent Fidesz figures will be an array of other European hard-right leaders, including the former head of the UK Independence party, Nigel Farage, Herbert Kickl, head of Austrian Freedom party, and Santiago Abascal, president of Spain’s Vox party. The US contingent will include several Republican members of Congress, Donald Trump’s former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and the chairman of the American Conservative Union, Matt Schlapp. Most influential of all, the Fox News talkshow host, Tucker Carlson, will be attending. Carlson has arguably done more than anyone to popularise the “great replacement theory” in the US, promoting it in 400 of his shows, according to an analysis by the New York Times. Carlson has developed particular ties with Orbán, originally through his father, Richard, whose political consultancy, Policy Impact Strategic Communications, is a registered lobbyist for the Hungarian leader. Last year, Carlson broadcast a week’s episodes of his show from Hungary, with a soft interview with Orbán himself, putting both the prime minister and his government in a positive light, and glossing over EU complaints that Orbán has curbed independent media and judicial autonomy, enriched his associates from the public purse and reshaped election laws to his benefit. Earlier this year, Carlson produced another pro-Orbán programme called Hungary vs. Soros: The Fight for Civilization, highlighting another ideological bond: the portrayal of George Soros, a Hungarian-born billionaire and philanthropist, as a malign Jewish financier pulling the strings on immigration and other liberal policies. “At this point, [American conservatives] are studying the Hungarian model and are looking at Hungary as a place where conservative policies can achieve their goals,” Boris Kálnoky, head of Mathias Corvinus Collegium (which was granted about $1.7bn by Orbán last year), told the Guardian. “Orbán is someone who attracts attention. And these visits by Tucker Carlson, who has a huge influence in this community, certainly put the spotlight on Hungary.” Richard Kraemer, a American Republican and analyst at the European Values Centre for Security Policy (EVCSP) in Prague, said he was concerned about the security implications of CPAC’s decision to hold its conference in Budapest which, after diplomatic expulsions in the rest of Europe following the Ukraine invasion, is widely seen as the most important outpost for Russian intelligence on the continent. “If you walk into this environment, you’re looking at – by at least one count –about a thousand security agency-related Russians that are in Hungary right now. And to put that in perspective, they have 170 diplomats in Washington,” said Kraemer, who co-authored a new EVCSP report this week that describes Orbán’s Hungary as “a Russia and China proxy weakening Europe”. “The are all these kinds of avenues whereby they’re able to put agents of influence in there and in front of Americans, who are basically low-hanging fruit that have decided to get even closer to the ground by showing up in Budapest,” Kraemer added. “What’s particularly disconcerting to me about this is that CPAC has basically decided that the cultural wars being fought right now by American conservatives are more important than America’s national security.”",News/World news,Orbán and US right to bond at Cpac in Hungary over ‘great replacement’ ideology,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/cpac-conference-budapest-hungary-viktor-orban-speaker
5/18/2022,"Critical global indicators of the climate crisis broke records in 2021, according to a UN report, from rising oceans to the levels of heat-trapping emissions in the atmosphere. The UN World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said these were clear signs of humanity’s impact on the planet, which was bringing long-lasting effects. Extreme weather, which the WMO called the day-to-day face of the climate emergency, wreaked a heavy toll on human lives and led to hundreds of billions of dollars in damages, the agency said. Droughts and floods triggered food price rises that have been exacerbated in 2022. The WMO’s State of the Global Climate in 2021 report also found the past seven years have been the hottest recorded. “Today’s State of the Climate report is a dismal litany of humanity’s failure to tackle climate disruption. Fossil fuels are a dead end – environmentally and economically,” said António Guterres, the secretary general of the UN. “The only sustainable future is a renewable one. The good news is that the lifeline is right in front of us. Wind and solar are readily available and, in most cases, cheaper than coal and other fossil fuels. If we act together, the renewable energy transformation can be the peace project of the 21st century.” Prof Petteri Taalas, the WMO secretary general, said: “Our climate is changing before our eyes. Human-induced greenhouse gases will warm the planet for many generations to come. Some glaciers have reached the point of no return and this will have long-term repercussions in a world in which more than 2 billion people already experience water stress. “Extreme weather has the most immediate impact on our daily lives,” he said. “We are seeing a drought emergency unfolding in the Horn of Africa, recent deadly flooding in South Africa and the extreme heat in India and Pakistan. Early warning systems are critically required [to save lives] yet these are only available in less than half of WMO’s 187 member nations.” The world’s oceans absorb more than 90% of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases and 2021 set a record. The increasing warmth in the ocean, which is irreversible over timescales of centuries to millennia, has been especially strong in the last 20 years. Much of the ocean experienced at least one strong marine heatwave in 2021, the WMO said. The global sea level also reached a new record high in 2021. It has increased by 10cm since 1993 and the rise is accelerating, driven by the melting of ice sheets and glaciers and the thermal expansion of the ocean. The rise imperils hundreds of millions of coastal dwellers, the WMO said, and increases the damage caused by hurricanes and cyclones. Almost a quarter of CO2 emissions are absorbed by the oceans, but this causes them to become more acidic. This threatens shell-forming wildlife and corals and therefore food security, tourism and coastal protection, the WMO said. The oceans are now more acidic than for at least 26,000 years. CO2 and methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, are at record levels, with CO2 concentration 50% higher than before the Industrial Revolution sparked the mass burning of fossil fuels. The global temperature in 2021 was 1.1C above the pre-industrial average, moving closer towards the 1.5C limit agreed by the world’s nations to avoid the worst climate impacts. The WMO noted exceptional heatwaves in 2021 in western North America and the Mediterranean, deadly flooding in Henan, China, and western Europe, and rain being recorded for the first time on the summit of Greenland’s ice sheet. The agency warned eastern Africa is facing a high risk of rains failing for a fourth consecutive season, meaning the worst drought in 40 years. Prof James Hansen, who warned the world about the climate crisis in testimony to the US Senate in 1988, said this week there was “a spectacular, continuing failure of governments to adopt effective long-term energy and climate policies. “We must all be aware that demands for effective policies will yield only superficial change as long as the role of special interests in government remains unaddressed.” Last week, the Guardian revealed that 195 oil and gas “carbon bombs” were planned by the industry, ie projects each producing at least a billion tonnes of CO2. These carbon bombs alone would drive global heating beyond the 1.5C limit, but the dozen biggest oil companies are on track to spend $103m a day to 2030 on climate-busting schemes.",News/Environment,"Critical climate indicators broke records in 2021, says UN",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/18/critical-climate-indicators-broke-records-in-2021-says-un
5/18/2022,"At last year’s Cop26 conference, when nations grappled with closing the gap between emissions and targets to limit global heating to 1.5C, one key variable was unclear. Major oil and gas firms had numerous large-scale extraction projects planned or under way, but measurable data on the problem was not available. So, with several other journalists, the Guardian’s environment editor, Damian Carrington, set about finding it. A “carbon bomb” is an oil or gas project that will result in at least a billion tonnes of CO2 emissions over its lifetime. “Getting hold of solid information about them is an absolute nightmare,” says Damian. “We’re talking about future projects, and that means you’re dealing with uncertainty. And the big oil and gas companies are … not all that open about it.” There simply wasn’t room to fit all of his remarkably detailed investigation into this week’s magazine but you can find much more from the carbon bombs series here, detailing the impacts from Australia to the US.

5/18/2022,"The last time I saw Slater, I knew something was wrong. I ate my dinner. He drank his. It was the night after Thanksgiving, and he’d been through hell. A broken leg. A busted nose. Lingering back injuries. Arrested by Swat cops after firing a shotgun in his house, believing he was about to be robbed. Rehab. Jail. Eviction. Despite all this, Slater seemed calm. Too calm. And I began to worry. After our dinner that night at the end of 2019, Slater asked me to come to his next court appearance. I promised I would. And then he did something unexpected: he hugged me. At first, I took it as a gesture of friendship. Later, I realized it meant a whole lot more. I first met Slater when I was researching a screenplay and needed to come up with authentic-sounding dialogue from someone who had seen combat. Slater seemed ideal, but after two tours in Iraq with the marines, he had such a gripping personal story to tell that I put aside my screenplay and instead profiled him for the Observer in 2014. On our first encounter, he scared the hell out of me – he was 6ft 1in, 230lb and heavily tattooed. The bearer of Popeye-sized arms and a lawn-mowered haircut, he possessed a fierce natural squint. Slater’s nickname, spot-on for his daunting look, was “Bear”. But appearances were deceiving. He was articulate, soft-spoken and self-deprecating. Inside his house, he introduced me to his French bulldogs, Beaux and Daisy, who smothered me with wet, slurpy kisses. A jar of marijuana buds and an industrial-sized bong sat on his glass-topped coffee table. “It’s the only thing that keeps me calm,” he said. At 18, he had enlisted in the marines because it was “the most badass” of all the services. Since his full name was Christian Slater, just like the actor, his radio call name in the field became “Hollywood”. But otherwise, everyone just called him Slater. On his first tour in Iraq, Slater was in the NBC unit, searching for nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. On his second tour, he was in mortuary affairs. The name was a euphemism. This was the detail that picked up the bodies – and the body parts. Even if some guy’s remains were unviewable, the marines had vowed to return every last piece of him to his family, in keeping with their motto of “No marine left behind,” which they spelled out with sandbags atop their bunker at the Al-Taqqadam airbase in central Iraq. Slater and 20 other marines had prepared for their mission by watching videos of suicide bombings and plane crashes. They collected colored ping-pong balls and chunks of raw meat, both meant to simulate body parts, and methodically scattered them around the grounds, then inventoried them on diagrams of human bodies. A veteran warrant officer told them their mission in Iraq would be the most honorable a marine could perform. But she cautioned, “nothing we tell you in class will prepare you for what it will be like in the field. Absolutely nothing.” Her words proved prophetic. Early on in Iraq, as Slater propped up one slain American so others could take fingerprints and check for exit wounds, the man’s brain tumbled from his skull. Most of the other marines dashed outside the bunker to throw up, but Slater held his position. Later, after an IED explosion obliterated an armored personnel carrier, two marines lifted up a corpse, only to watch it come apart in the middle and spill its innards on their boots. Meanwhile, others collected the various body parts – an arm, a leg, a face, a penis. “Picking up human confetti,” recounted Slater. The marines called their dead “angels”. By the end of their tour, they had sealed 182 “angels” in body bags and metal coffins for flights back home. They also recovered the remains of Iraqi civilians, children and enemy insurgents. Slater would never forget how anguished and angry their relatives looked when they were handed the bodies. Under a full moon and within range of Falluja snipers, Slater and the others extracted what remained of an Iraqi mother and her child after an army fuel truck rolled over her hatchback. To numb the horrors, Slater worked out maniacally at the base gym. Multiple sets, multiple reps. Dead lifts, presses, rows, curls and more, using up to 270lb of weight. Anything to help forget the work. He took endless showers “to get the day’s business off me”. On the day they finally left to return home, everyone in the unit turned to face the mortuary affairs bunker and shoot it a middle finger. After Iraq, Slater served as an embassy guard in Mozambique and Latvia. During a Nato summit in Riga, he posed for photos with President George W Bush. But then things started to slide downhill. Visiting his family in Mississippi, he was emotionally flattened, but quick to anger if they cut him short when he talked about Iraq. Every time he walked out the door, he saw the faces of the dead staring back at him. Every mail box, trash bin and newspaper kiosk loomed as a hiding spot for an IED. He would stay up for 72 hours, then sleep the next 72, as if on extended sentry duty. A serious spinal injury Slater had suffered during a tank-riding mishap in Iraq flared up anew. After surgery at the Bethesda naval hospital, he contracted a systemic and near-fatal infection. When a military doctor tried to acupuncture his ears for the pain, Slater threw him out of the room. He was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder shortly after. Slater drank heavily and became addicted to painkillers and antidepressants. He shuttled in and out of treatment programs, but not always willingly. When they were preparing for their mission in Iraq, Slater had led the others in their morning runs and calisthenics and pushed them to buy field gear, pay bills, update wills and sign powers of attorney. In Iraq, he was the hi-tech wizard who repaired the radios, generators and engines and operated the tracking devices inside the Humvees. “He was ‘the be-all, end-all, go-to guy,’” recalls Dan Cotnoir, a now-retired sergeant who was in Slater’s unit. Some had bristled at his gung-ho attitude. He was “a self-proclaimed meathead, what we called a ‘hot shit’ marine”, says Jessica Goodell, another member of the mortuary affairs team. “He was so hardcore, always in shape, always doing jobs above his rank, always taking on more responsibility and always telling me what to do.” But post-Iraq, Slater became the “go-to guy” nobody could go to. In 2008, the corps retired him on medical grounds. Despite the corps’ motto, he felt that if he died, “nobody was even gonna hiccup”. The average number of daily suicides among veterans has been steadily rising over the past two decades, from 81 in 2001 to 125.5 in 2019, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs. In 2019, the suicide rate among veterans (31.6 per 100,000) was substantially higher than the rate among non-veterans (16.8 per 100,000), the department said at the end of last year. The Covid surge has raised new concerns about a possible spike in suicides. By February of this year, the department had reported more than 20,000 Covid-related deaths among veterans and VA employees since the start of the pandemic. While mental health consultations for veterans by phone or video had increased, some VA officials worried because many facilities had stopped in-person visits to limit the virus’s spread. Politicians have taken note. “Far too many of our fighting men and women come home suffering from invisible wounds of war,” said Senator John Tester, Democratic chairman of the US Senate veterans’ affairs committee. “And the isolation of the pandemic has often made that suffering worse.” Slater tried to kill himself multiple times. Once, pumped full of booze and drugs, he nearly succumbed to hypothermia on the Gulfport, Mississippi, porch of his sister, Holly Slater Gibbs. Later, back east, he tried twice more to do himself in. Others from Slater’s unit went through similarly dark times. One female marine spiraled into drug and alcohol abuse after escaping a perilous relationship in which another marine, who was suffering from post-traumatic stress, had regularly threatened to kill her and himself with his gun when he wasn’t hiding in closets. A third died mysteriously. A fourth tried to kill himself using the same meds the Veterans Administration still gives him to this day. Others in the unit absorbed so much psychological trauma that they have never been the same. Although they were eligible for Purple Hearts, few of the mortuary affairs marines sought them. How could they justify getting medals for their trauma, they felt, when they had been sending their comrades home in pieces? It seemed disrespectful and selfish to become such glory hounds. Slater moved to Oregon in 2010 and seemed to rebound. The climate was a relief from the heat and humidity of his native south and the sandstorms in Iraq. The waterfalls, rivers, old-growth pine forests and snow-capped mountains gave him solace. He found a therapist in Portland, the first one he had ever trusted. When his nerves became too jangled or his old war injuries flared up, he turned to marijuana, for which the state of Oregon granted him a medical prescription. He began working towards his college degree, intending to open a private security business. His French bulldogs produced a litter of pups. To have living, breathing creatures in his care felt good. They became his family. He made friends, too. One was Jessica Goodell, his fellow marine. While she was attending college in upstate New York and working towards her PhD, he showed up with bags of food, cleaning supplies and kitchen utensils. “I want to take care of you,” he told her. Although their relationship in the field had been prickly, they ended up becoming close friends. When I interviewed Slater in 2014, he felt he was on the right track. “I’m working on my degree,” he said. “And I’m not trying to kill myself.” Afterwards, we occasionally met for a beer. In some ways, our friendship was remarkable. Here I was, an ageing child of the 1960s who had done everything he could to avoid Vietnam. And here he was, a combat-hardened marine who had performed the most gruesome duty imaginable. The difference between us could not have been more profound. I felt honored to be his friend. Sometimes, he would bring along his friend Kat Figaro, AKA “Fig”, a marine who had served with him in Latvia. She was smart and sassy and, to my great delight, both a lover of birds and someone who cursed like a marine. Other times, I would consider Slater in the context of my own family and, in particular, a now-estranged relative through marriage who fancied himself an authority on war. Not because he had ever served in the military, but because he had read some books on military history, always voted Republican and kept guns in his house. Trying to have a discussion with him was futile since he would steamroll me with his self-professed expertise on the nature of combat. How satisfying it would have been, I imagined, to watch Slater, in his quiet, self-effacing way, talk about his time in Iraq and reduce this blowhard to a puddle of shame. After our post-Thanksgiving dinner, I texted Slater several times so I could show up for his court appearance. I never got a reply. In January, I learned why. Two weeks after our dinner, he had taken a fatal overdose of drugs. His body was not discovered for three weeks. Friends knew he had been self-medicating. Inside the house where he lived before being evicted, they had spotted heroin, human growth hormone, ketamine and propofol. In his new apartment, where his body was found, police discovered a syringe, a burnt spoon, pills and his bong. “He just danced with the devil once too often,” says his friend Dan Cotnoir. Many believe he hadn’t intended to die. Just one night earlier, he had told Cotnoir and his wife, Lori, that he would come to stay with them in Massachusetts. Others, however, felt his dying was a deliberate act. When the police found his body, they discovered his driver’s license, his Marine Corps ID card and his wallet laid out on a countertop, as if to leave a message. Nationwide, there are numerous law firms that specialize in suing the Veterans Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs over allegations of malpractice. One attorney, Peter Bertling, who is based in Santa Barbara, California, pointed to two cases he has handled that are linked to the West Palm Beach, Florida, VA medical center. Last December, Bertling filed a lawsuit on behalf of the family of Sgt Brieux Dash, a 33-year-old Iraq war veteran, who, in 2019, hanged himself at the center. A report by the VA’s inspector general later found that Dash had received “reasonable care”, but also faulted the facility for failing to ensure adequate mental health training for staff, failing to correct physical hazards in the facility and failing to fix security cameras that had not been working for three years. Bertling is preparing to file yet another suit in connection with another veteran, who had also been under treatment at the West Palm Beach facility and who fatally shot himself while lying next to his wife in bed. Meanwhile, Bertling recently won a $1m settlement for the family of Gary Steven Pressley, a 28-year-old veteran who fatally shot himself in April 2019 in the parking lot of the Carl Vinson VA medical center in Dublin, Georgia, to “escape the excruciating pain and suffering he was experiencing”, according to the lawsuit. In the suit, Bertling accused the veteran’s VA physician of cutting off Pressley’s pain medication. Another Bertling lawsuit, still pending, alleges that the hospital switchboard operator and her private employer, with whom the hospital had contracted, failed to heed family warnings about the anguished veteran. “These things are preventable,” says Bertling. “But medical or mental health providers do not follow the VA’s own policies, pain or PTSD are not properly treated and staffing is often inadequate or incompetent.” In the wake of Pressley’s death, VA officials stated that it does not comment on individual suicides or pending litigation. It added: “However, suicide prevention is the VA’s highest clinical priority, and the department is taking significant steps to address the issue.” A major obstacle to helping veterans, according to Tester, has been “the stigma to getting help.” Men like Slater are reluctant to ask for VA assistance, anticipating endless forms, skeptical shrinks and social workers and inept doctors. “No one is gonna fight to claim they are broken,” says Cotnoir. “They’re too proud to do that. They want to fight to be better. If Slater needed more help, the VA should have been tripping over itself to get it to him.” And ex-marine Jessica Goodell adds, “The military wants people who will deploy. If you show signs of struggling, they reprimand you. And suicide is considered weak and selfish.” After returning from Iraq and struggling with her own PTSD, Goodell went on to write a highly acclaimed book about her combat experiences, Shade It Black. (The title refers to the way the mortuary affairs marines would diagram a corpse when limbs or other body parts were missing.) Goodell believes civilians need to better educate themselves about what members of the military must do in combat, and about the trauma that endures after they come home. And yet, she is frustrated by what she terms “a dissonance” in the messaging. “On the one hand, the military struggles to tell the public what it does,” she said. “On the other hand, it doesn’t want the public to know.” Since taking the gavel as chairman of the veterans’ affairs committee in January 2021, Tester has successfully championed laws to improve mental health outreach during the pandemic and bolster suicide-prevention efforts. Programs are under way to better educate VA mental health care providers; conduct alternative therapies with animals, sports, recreation and art; do more outreach in rural areas; and study the impact of living at high altitudes, which is thought to exacerbate instances of suicide and depression. When the VA doctors changed Slater’s meds, his friends told me, he resumed self-medicating. Soon he was babbling incoherently, sleepwalking and hallucinating about fires and squatters in his crawl spaces. Then he got busted for the shotgun incident. From jail, Slater had called Gibbs asking for bail money. But he was evasive about what had happened. She pushed him to re-enter drug treatment and offered to fly from Mississippi to Oregon for his court appearances. He never spoke to her again. Gibbs believes the Department of Veterans Affairs failed him. “The doctors gave him so much crap,” she said. “Uppers, downers, mood modifiers. They use the cookie-cutter method for returning veterans. Give them as many pills as they want.” The VA in Portland declined to comment on Slater’s case. It also declined to let me see his medical records, even though I was authorized by his sister to see them. After Slater died, the Washington county medical examiner’s office in Oregon sent an investigator to his apartment to deal with his body. Steven Hargis, Washington county’s chief medico-legal death investigator, said the procedures the investigator followed were nearly identical to the ones Slater himself had employed when he was processing the “angels” in Iraq. Early in 2020, as Slater’s dogs cavorted at their feet, 20 of Slater’s closest friends gathered at a house in the Oregon woods to memorialize what they termed “all his Slaterness”. Their recollections were telling: “An outstanding leader … always had your back … ran at every challenge full throttle … never wanted anyone else to carry his weight … wrestled with burdens no other person should have to carry … wanted to heal himself … would stare at you if you ordered only a half rack of ribs … the biggest goofball in the world … made you feel loved and cared for …” At the time of his death, Christian Hyde Slater, sergeant, United States Marine Corps, was 36 years old.

5/18/2022,"It’s got to be one of the worst jobs in showbiz: being a-ha’s official photographer. Here’s the poor guy after a particularly awkward, everyone gritting their teeth photo shoot: “It’s very hard as a photographer when people don’t want to be together. It shows.” And it really does show. Watching this 40th-anniversary documentary, you might conclude that what a-ha really need is a band therapist, not a photographer. Four years in the making, a-ha: The Movie is the comprehensive story of the Norwegian trio (about 20 minutes too comprehensive for all but diehard fans). To anyone over 45, no introductions are necessary: a-ha is the band whose single Take on Me reached No 2 in the UK charts back in 1985 (it’s still a knockout pop tune with the crack cocaine of riffs). Back then, the band’s singer Morten Harket smouldered like a sensitive misunderstood bad boy. Now he looks like the dishy doctor from a daytime soap, still impossibly chiselled. Like all the band, Harket has got his personal demons: he’s a perfectionist who instantly reaches for the hand sanitiser after meeting fans (this was filmed pre-Covid, apparently). Keyboardist Magne Furuholmen still resents being booted off guitar back in the 80s. Guitarist Pål Waaktaar-Savoy is a controlling presence. The history that emerges here is of a band yo-yoing between attempts to be taken seriously as artists, then coming back for more boyband fame and adulation. An air of collective self-loathing and regret hangs over them. Of course, it’s impossible to feel that sorry for three wealthy men in middle age swanning around the world on sold-out tours wearing leather jackets that cost the price of a second-hand car. Waaktaar-Savoy’s wife puts it best when she says it’s a shame they can’t enjoy it more. “It’s sinful not to appreciate what you have when you have so much.”  a-ha: The Movie is released on 20 May in cinemas.",Arts/Film,a-ha: The Movie review – Take on Me hitmakers relive the highs and the lows,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/18/a-ha-the-movie-review-take-on-me-hitmakers-relive-the-highs-and-the-lows
5/18/2022,"Lovestruck High (Amazon Prime) is the latest in a long line of objectively terrible dating shows that drag you into its vacuous dramas before you have the chance to realise that hours have passed and the light within you has dimmed to a compliant darkness that can only think in terms of who is going to be “pied off” next. The idea, which must have been flagged as “iffy” at any number of meetings but went ahead regardless, is that a bunch of Love Island-ish twentysomethings pretend to be going to an American-style high school, with the goal of finding love and winning $100,000 (£80,000). They are all British, bar one Irish guy, so I hope everyone is keeping an eye on the exchange rate. Sending heavily tattooed adults to a fake school for pretend lessons helmed by actors playing teachers who infantilise them, in the hope that they all hook up? I watched Open House: The Great Sex Experiment, so it’s hard to be surprised. It owes an aesthetic debt to Sex Education, with its bright colour scheme and British boarding school meets American high school kitsch. But its biggest homage is to Made in Chelsea. It is shot in that distinctive scripted reality style – what is the technical name for an earnest chat about feelings encircled by a camera in the style of a lion stalking its prey? – with a lot of slow-motion shots of toned bodies “doing PE”. Everything is engineered to create unnecessary conflict and tension, which makes it hopelessly, shamefully addictive. There are two original qualities. One is that it is narrated by Lindsay Lohan, who throws in as many Mean Girls references as she can without actually naming the movie, and chivvies along the action with commentary such as “Wow, savage” and “Geez, high school is tough”. Lovestruck High is heavy on the unnecessary interjections: each episode is about 48 minutes long, but it takes on the reality TV tic of extensively recapping things that have just happened, or painstakingly explaining things that are about to happen, and it could easily shave 20 minutes off its running time. “I’m kissing all these people,” says one newcomer, whom we have just seen kissing all these people. The other innovation, if you can call it that, is that this isn’t the usual straight men and straight women competing for each other’s affections. The contestants here are straight, gay and all that’s in between. At first, this promises to add an ingredient that all dating shows should strive for, which is chaos; people aren’t sure who to ask to the homecoming dance, because not everyone is open about their sexuality to begin with. But it soon settles into cliques and friendship groups, and sexual preferences are the least of anyone’s concerns. Mostly, this is scripted reality by numbers, and not even a milkshake at the diner after a cheerleading class against a backdrop of Mean Girls in-jokes can dress it up as anything else. The first three episodes “drop” at once, and the speed at which the drama moves is astonishing. Friendships, crushes and relationships form, collapse and reconstitute themselves, like a liquid metal Terminator. By the end of the third episode, when a small and completely predictable twist takes place, the entire cast starts to act as if someone has dropped dead right in front of them. It is hysterical, in every sense of the word. I was sucked in from the start, though I couldn’t help but wonder if the only person getting pied off was me.",Arts/Television & radio,Lovestruck High review – Lindsay Lohan’s dating show is absolutely hysterical (in every sense),https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/18/lovestruck-high-review-lindsay-lohans-dating-show-is-absolutely-hysterical-in-every-sense
5/18/2022,"The Conservative MP arrested on suspicion of rape and other offences has been bailed, as Liz Truss said she was worried that there were once again “appalling” accusations against a parliamentarian. The MP was arrested on Tuesday after being accused of rape and sexual assault offences spanning seven years between 2002 and 2009. Scotland Yard said the unnamed man in his 50s was also detained on suspicion of indecent assault, abuse of position of trust and misconduct in public office. The MP has not been suspended by the Conservative party but Chris Heaton-Harris, the chief whip, asked him to stay away from parliament. Truss, the foreign secretary, said she did not know the identity of the MP but defended the whips’ decision, saying the party needed to wait until the conclusion of the police investigation. But she added: “I’m very, very concerned about the reports that I’ve heard. Clearly, this is a matter for the police. “The police are currently working on the case but it is worrying that we are seeing these appalling … accusations, again, about a parliamentarian.” The arrest comes at a time when the Conservatives have faced multiple scandals relating to sexual abuse and misbehaviour. A date was announced for two byelections on Tuesday triggered by the resignation of Conservative MPs. Imran Ahmad Khan, the former MP for Wakefield, was convicted of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy, while the former Tiverton MP Neil Parish admitted watching pornography in the House of Commons chamber. Both contests will take place on 23 June, with Labour hoping to win in Wakefield, and the Liberal Democrats positioning themselves as the challengers in Tiverton. The Lib Dems pulled off a shock victory in North Shropshire last year after Owen Paterson resigned over paid lobbying. Another Conservative MP, David Warburton, who represents Somerton and Frome, has had the whip suspended while under investigation for sexual harassment by the Commons’ independent complaints and grievance scheme. Details of the MP’s arrest emerged during what the government had hoped would be “crime week”, with announcements on toughening up policing. The prime minister told his cabinet on Tuesday morning: “Crime, crime, crime is what we want to focus on.”",News/UK news,Conservative MP arrested on suspicion of rape bailed,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/18/conservative-mp-arrested-on-suspicion-of-rape-bailed
