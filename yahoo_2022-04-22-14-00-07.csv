4/22/2022,"By Yimou Lee and Ben Blanchard TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan is developing missiles that can attack enemy air bases and bring down cruise missiles, and drones that can target their firing locations, according to a report by the military-owned body making the weapons. Taiwan last year approved T$240 billion ($8.20 billion) in extra military spending over the next five years as tensions with China, which claims the island as its own territory, have hit a new high and Chinese military planes have repeatedly flown through Taiwan's air defence identification zone. Taiwan plans to more than double its yearly missile production capacity to close to 500 this year, the island's defence ministry said last month, as it boosts its combat power. In a report to parliament this week, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, the military-owned National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology offered more details of what the missiles and drones it is developing could do in a war. The Hsiung Sheng land-attack missile, which experts say could have a range of up to 1,000km - comes in two versions: one with a high-explosive warhead to hit bunkers and hardened command centres, and other with ""dispersal"" munitions to take out airfield facilities, it said. Chieh Chung, a researcher at Taipei-based National Policy Foundation, said the Hsiung Sheng could reach most bases under the People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theatre Command, including those near Shanghai and the province of Zhejiang. ""It could greatly boost the national army's capacity to delay or paralyse the Communist forces' pace of an invasion of Taiwan, making it hard for them to achieve a rapid war,"" he said. The advanced Sky Bow III surface-to-air missile is designed to take down ballistic and cruise missiles, as well as fighter jets. Taiwan's plans predate Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but the war has prompted conversations about the lessons Taiwan could apply to fighting off a Chinese attack, including how Ukraine has resisted a numerically-superior force. One Taiwan-based Western security source told Reuters that although Taiwan was getting gear such as Harpoon anti-ship missiles from the United States, its own missile programme would help ensure the island would not have to rely on foreign supplies, as Ukraine has. ""It's a hedging strategy,"" the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The institute said drones, which Ukraine has used to great effect against Russia's military, could attack enemy missile launch sites or act as decoys to help pinpoint enemy radars. Four new facilities, including bases and repair plants, would be built by 2025 for the new drones, it said. The defence ministry has previously announced plans to start manufacturing unspecified ""attack drones"" with an annual production target of 48 such aircraft. Little has been disclosed about the domestically produced drones. The first batch of U.S.-made MQ-9 Reaper drones, which can be armed with missiles and operate at long range, will enter service with Taiwan by 2025, the defence ministry said last month. About 64% of Taiwan's extra military spending, which came on top of planned military spending of T$471.7 billion for 2022, will be spent on anti-ship weapons such as land-based missile systems, including a T$148.9 billion plan to mass-produce homegrown missiles and ""high-performance"" ships. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has made modernising the military a top priority, pushing for defence projects including a new class of stealthy warship and home-grown submarines. Tsai has championed what she calls ""asymmetric warfare"": developing high-tech, highly mobile weapons that are hard to destroy and can deliver precision attacks. Taiwan believes China has thousands of missiles aimed at its territory, and Chinese forces dwarf those of Taiwan's. China also has nuclear weapons, which Taiwan does not. China has never ruled out the use of force to bring the democratic island under its control.

4/22/2022,"By Stella Qiu, Jamie Freed and Allison Lampert (Reuters) - China said on Wednesday the black boxes of a Boeing 737-800 jet that crashed last month were badly damaged, leaving virtually no publicly available clues to explain its violent plunge into a wooded hillside, killing all 132 people on board. China Eastern flight MU5735 from Kunming to Guangzhou plunged from cruising altitude into the mountains of Guangxi on March 21 in China's first fatal air crash since 2010. Summarising its preliminary crash report, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) did not include any information from the cockpit voice and data recorders, which had been sent to Washington for analysis. ""The two recorders on the plane were severely damaged due to the impact, and the data restoration and analysis work is still in progress,"" CAAC said in a statement. CAAC gave no indication of the focus of its probe. Most accidents are caused by a mix of technical and human factors. ""There are many difficulties in investigating this accident, and at the moment the available evidence is limited,"" Li Yong, deputy director of CAAC's aviation safety office, said in an interview with state news agency Xinhua. But the regulator ruled out a number of risks, saying the crew were qualified, the jet was properly maintained, the weather was fine and no dangerous goods were onboard. In a potentially key finding, it said most of the wreckage was concentrated in one area. Safety analysts said that would not typically happen in the event of a catastrophic mid-air break-up or explosion, but did not rule out parts being torn off in the dive after CAAC said part of one wingtip was found 12 km (8 miles) away. ""Two questions you'd have to look at: did that piece coming off cause the dive or did the dive cause that piece to go off,"" said Anthony Brickhouse, an air safety expert at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. Chinese aviation expert Li Xiaojin said in the absence of other findings, data from black boxes was vital. ""These boxes are designed to be really, really robust,"" Brickhouse said. ""I really can't think of an accident in recent history where we found the boxes and we didn't get information from them."" NO MAX LINK The 737-800 is a predecessor to the 737 MAX, which has not resumed commercial service in China more than three years after two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. But China Eastern, which grounded its entire fleet of 223 737-800 planes after the crash, resumed those commercial flights on Sunday, effectively ruling out any immediate new safety concern over Boeing's previous and still most widely used model. A U.S. official noted that no safety bulletins or other advisories had been issued by Boeing in the wake of the crash. In its summary, CAAC did not point to any technical recommendations on the 737-800, which has been in service since 1997 with a strong safety record, according to experts. It does not have the cockpit system at the centre of the MAX crisis. Boeing shares closed 1.3% lower on Wednesday. Boeing declined to comment on the CAAC statement but said it would continue to support the crash investigation. The Chinese agency said it had completed the preliminary report within the limit of 30 days. Such reports are usually made public, though they do not have to be under global rules. China does not have a tradition of publishing widely accessible accident reports, but the statement marks a step towards transparency that has been credited with making flying safer worldwide, Paul Hayes, director of safety at UK-based Ascend by Cirium, said. A final report into the causes could take two years or more to compile based on previous complex accident investigations, CAAC's Li told Xinhua. CAAC said the last normal call from controllers to the plane was at 2:16 p.m. local time while it was cruising at 29,200 feet, less than six minutes before the plane disappeared from radar. Brickhouse said it had appeared the flight was progressing normally and communications were normal. ""And then all of a sudden, the aircraft wasn't communicating and that's when it started diving.""

4/22/2022,"BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — North Dakota's longest-serving state senator resigned Wednesday as head of a powerful panel that oversees the Legislature's business between sessions, just days after a published report that he had exchanged scores of text messages with a man jailed on child pornography charges. Republican Sen. Ray Holmberg, 79, stepped down from the Legislative Management committee, saying in a statement “recent events and discussions have made it clear to me that the interim governing body of the legislature, Legislative Management, does not need to be any part of that discussion.” Holmberg will remain on the panel, but not as its chairman. “No further comments on this announcement will be forthcoming,” his statement said. He had announced in March he would not seek reelection. The Forum of Fargo reported Friday that Holmberg exchanged 72 text messages in August with Nicholas James Morgan-Derosier as Morgan-Derosier was held in the Grand Forks County Jail. The newspaper cited a jail log it obtained through a records request showing the time and date of the text messages. Morgan-Derosier was held at the time on state child pornography charges. Holmberg first told the Forum that he had read a newspaper story about the charges, then in a later interview said he had not, the Forum reported. He told the Forum that his text messages with Morgan-Derosier were related to “a variety of things,” including patio work Morgan-Derosier did for him. He also said he no longer has the text messages. “They’re just gone,” he said. Holmberg declined to speak with The Associated Press, and in a text referred all questions to his attorney, Mark Friese of Fargo. Friese, a prominent North Dakota criminal defense attorney, said Tuesday that Holmberg hasn’t been charged with any crime, and there is no indication that he will. “I know he was in the senator’s employ,” Friese said of Morgan-Derosier. “The fact that (Holmberg) knew him doesn’t say a lot in my view.” Democratic Party Chairman Patrick Hart had called for Holmberg to step down from Legislative Management and to publicly release the text messages. Holmberg was chairman of the Legislative Management committee four times during his 46-year tenure in the Legislature. The 17-member panel decides committee assignments and choses study topics that often inspire legislation. Holmberg, a retired school counselor, announced in March that he was retiring from the Legislature, a move that came as a surprise to many lawmakers and others at the state Capitol. “At age 79, the stress of a session and a campaign will only exacerbate a weakened ability to concentrate on the matters at hand and effectively recall events,” Holmberg said in a statement at the time. Gov. Doug Burgum, the state's congressional delegation, state lawmakers and others showered Holmberg with accolades at that time. GOP Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner said the only thing Holmberg can be accused of at this point is a lapse of judgement. Wardner said he spoke with Holmberg Wednesday, before Holmberg stepped down as the committee chairman. Wardner would not disclose details of the call. “He sent 72 messages to a bad, bad person,"" Wardner said. ""That's not illegal and until there is more information I think (Holmberg's resignation) is a step in the right direction.” “If there is any evidence of any wrongdoing we will act and we will act quickly,” Wardner said. “Right now, all we have is that it looks bad.” Holmberg also sits on the state's Emergency Commission, which allocates funding and resources in times of an emergency. The commission is comprised of the governor, the secretary of state, the chairmen of the state House and Senate appropriations committees, and the majority leaders of the House and Senate. Wardner said he would not push to have Holmberg removed from that panel at this time. Republican House Majority Leader Chet Pollert, the committee's vice chairman, will head Legislative Management until the session begins in January. Pollert also announced earlier that he is retiring. Pollert said Holmberg's decision to step down as chairman of the committee “was the right thing to do.” “Sen. Holmberg has his things he needs to deal with and we don't want it to be a distraction from the Legislature,” Pollert said. The state charges against Morgan-Derosier have been superseded by federal charges that include possession and distribution of child pornography and travel with intent to engage in illicit sexual conduct. Prosecutors allege Morgan-Derosier possessed several thousand images and videos depicting sexually abused children. He also is accused of taking two children under the age of 10 from Minnesota to his Grand Forks home, with the intent of sexually abusing them. Lawmakers are paid $526 a month and $189 a day during a session or if they meet for a committee hearing. Legislative majority and minority leaders and the chairman of Legislative Management are paid an additional $377 monthly. Holmberg and other committee chairmen also are paid an additional $10 daily during a legislative session and $5 daily for an interim committee meeting. ___ This version corrects the details on legislative leadership pay.",U.S./Associated Press,ND lawmaker quits panel leadership after texts with inmate,https://news.yahoo.com/nd-lawmaker-quits-panel-leadership-175200307.html
