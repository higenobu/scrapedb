3/13/2022,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Saudi Arabia on Saturday executed 81 people convicted of crimes ranging from killings to belonging to militant groups, the largest known mass execution carried out in the kingdom in its modern history. The number of executed surpassed even the toll of a January 1980 mass execution for the 63 militants convicted of seizing the Grand Mosque in Mecca in 1979, the worst-ever militant attack to target the kingdom and Islam's holiest site. It wasn't clear why the kingdom choose Saturday for the executions, though they came as much of the world's attention remained focused on Russia's war on Ukraine — and as the U.S. hopes to lower record-high gasoline prices as energy prices spike worldwide. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson reportedly plans a trip to Saudi Arabia next week over oil prices as well. The number of death penalty cases being carried out in Saudi Arabia had dropped during the coronavirus pandemic, though the kingdom continued to behead convicts under King Salman and his assertive son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The state-run Saudi Press Agency announced Saturday's executions, saying they included those “convicted of various crimes, including the murdering of innocent men, women and children.” The kingdom also said some of those executed were members of al-Qaida, the Islamic State group and also backers of Yemen's Houthi rebels. A Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Iran-backed Houthis since 2015 in neighboring Yemen in an effort to restore the internationally recognized government to power. Those executed included 73 Saudis, seven Yemenis and one Syrian. The report did not say where the executions took place. “The accused were provided with the right to an attorney and were guaranteed their full rights under Saudi law during the judicial process, which found them guilty of committing multiple heinous crimes that left a large number of civilians and law enforcement officers dead,” the Saudi Press Agency said. “The kingdom will continue to take a strict and unwavering stance against terrorism and extremist ideologies that threaten the stability of the entire world,” the report added. It did not say how the prisoners were executed, though death-row inmates typically are beheaded in Saudi Arabia. An announcement by Saudi state television described those executed as having “followed the footsteps of Satan” in carrying out their crimes. The executions drew immediate international criticism. “The world should know by now that when Mohammed bin Salman promises reform, bloodshed is bound to follow,” said Soraya Bauwens, the deputy director of Reprieve, a London-based advocacy group. Ali Adubusi, the director of the European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights, alleged that some of those executed had been tortured and faced trials “carried out in secret.” “These executions are the opposite of justice,” he said. The kingdom's last mass execution came in January 2016, when the kingdom executed 47 people, including a prominent opposition Shiite cleric  who had rallied demonstrations in the kingdom. In 2019, the kingdom beheaded 37 Saudi citizens, most of them minority Shiites, in a mass execution across the country for alleged terrorism-related crimes. It also publicly nailed the severed body and head of a convicted extremist to a pole as a warning to others. Such crucifixions after execution, while rare, do occur in the kingdom. Activists, including Ali al-Ahmed of the U.S.-based Institute for Gulf Affairs, and the group Democracy for the Arab World Now said they believe that over three dozen of those executed Saturday also were Shiites. The Saudi statement, however, did not identify the faiths of those killed. Shiites, who live primarily in the kingdom's oil-rich east, have long complained of being treated as second-class citizens. Executions of Shiites in the past have stirred regional unrest. Saudi Arabia meanwhile remains engaged in diplomatic talks with its Shiite regional rival Iran to try to ease yearslong tensions. Sporadic protests erupted Saturday night in the island kingdom of Bahrain — which has a majority Shiite population but is ruled by a Sunni monarchy, a Saudi ally — over the mass execution. The 1979 seizure of the Grand Mosque remains a crucial moment in the history of the oil-rich kingdom. A band of ultraconservative Saudi Sunni militants took the Grand Mosque, home to the cube-shaped Kaaba that Muslims pray toward five times a day, demanding the Al Saud royal family abdicate. A two-week siege that followed ended with an official death toll of 229 killed. The kingdom’s rulers soon further embraced Wahhabism, an ultraconservative Islamic doctrine. Since taking power, Crown Prince Mohammed under his father has increasingly liberalized life in the kingdom, opening movie theaters, allowing women to drive and defanging the country's once-feared religious police. However, U.S. intelligence agencies believe the crown prince also ordered the slaying and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, while overseeing airstrikes in Yemen that killed hundreds of civilians. In excerpts of an interview with The Atlantic magazine, the crown prince discussed the death penalty, saying a “high percentage” of executions had been halted through the payment of so-called “blood money” settlements to grieving families. “Well about the death penalty, we got rid of all of it, except for one category, and this one is written in the Quran, and we cannot do anything about it, even if we wished to do something, because it is clear teaching in the Quran,” the prince said, according to a transcript later published by the Saudi-owned satellite news channel Al-Arabiya. “If someone killed someone, another person, the family of that person has the right, after going to the court, to apply capital punishment, unless they forgive him. Or if someone threatens the life of many people, that means he has to be punished by the death penalty.” He added: “Regardless if I like it or not, I don’t have the power to change it.” ___ Associated Press writer Aya Batrawy in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report. ___ Follow Jon Gambrell on Twitter at www.twitter.com/jongambrellAP.",World/Associated Press,Saudi Arabia puts 81 to death in its largest mass execution,https://news.yahoo.com/saudi-arabia-says-executed-81-133114120.html
3/13/2022,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder met Russian President Vladimir Putin for several hours on Thursday evening in a bid to end the war in Ukraine, Germany's Bild am Sonntag (BamS) reported, although it was unclear what was achieved. Citing a person with detailed insight into Schroeder's activities, the weekly newspaper said Schroeder had also had a long talk with one of Putin's closest advisers. He left Moscow early on Saturday morning with his wife and flew to Istanbul, the paper said, without disclosing any further details of the conversations. The former chancellor, who is a personal friend of Putin and has links to Russian companies, had met a group of Ukrainians with links to the country's delegation for peace talks with Russia in Turkey on Monday evening, reported BamS. The source told BamS that Schroeder was currently the only person to have had direct contact with both Putin and top Ukrainian officials. News website Politico first reported that Schroeder was flying to Moscow for talks with Putin, and German government sources said it had not agreed to any meeting nor been involved in one. The government's press office referred to remarks made by Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Friday when he declined to comment on the meeting beyond saying that he would take note of any results and include them in other efforts he was involved in. Scholz, who travels to Turkey on Monday, spoke to Putin in a three-way phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday. Schroeder, Social Democrat (SPD) chancellor from 1998 to 2005, is on the board of Russian oil giant Rosneft and is chairman of the shareholders' committee of the company in charge of building the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which has been shelved. He has faced calls from some German government politicians to step down from his roles over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Nobody was immediately available at Schroeder's office.

3/13/2022,"Former President Donald Trump in recent weeks asked his supporters for money as part of a promotion to eat dinner with him in New Orleans last Saturday. The only problem was that no one actually got to eat dinner with Trump, The Washington Post reported Friday, citing four people familiar with the matter. A series of email pitches to small-dollar donors offered up what any loyal Trump supporter would undoubtedly appreciate. “We’ll cover your flight. We’ll cover your very nice hotel. We’ll cover your dinner,” one email read. “All you have to do is enter.“ More from Rolling Stone Trump Compares YouTube Removing His Election Lies to Russian Authoritarianism 'Cuomo-W. Trump-L.': How CNN's Jeff Zucker and His Cronies Manipulated the News Trump Refuses to Condemn Putin Despite Sean Hannity Practically Begging Him To It’s unclear how much money the pitches raised for Save America PAC, the former president’s political action committee, or how many people donated. But similar contests brought in hundreds of thousands of dollars, people involved with them told the Post. A Trump spokesperson chalked up the lack of a winner in this contest to an “administrative error.” “President Trump has awarded more than 100 prizes to contest winners across America, but due to an administrative error in this individual circumstance, the contest winner was not properly notified for last weekend’s event in New Orleans,” Taylor Budowich told the Post. “Consistent with the rules of the sweepstakes, a substitute prize will be awarded to the winner.” Budowich didn’t specify what this substitute prize would be. According to Save America PAC, the value of the original prize is about $3,000. It’s certainly possible an “administrative error” is responsible, but this also isn’t the first time this has happened. The Post‘s story echoes a 2019 report by Popular Information which found that Trump’s campaign held at least 15 online contests for a chance to win a meal with him — but no one appeared to have actually done so. (Trump’s communications director claimed then that “people win the contests each time,” yet didn’t offer proof.) Trump’s shady fundraising tactics don’t end there. He and the Republican Party were forced to refund millions of dollars they acquired last year through deceptive email blasts, specifically by having donors unwittingly opt in to recurring payments. The recurring donation box was pre-checked earlier this week, as well, when Save America PAC solicited supporters to fund a new private plane for the former president. “Do you remember Trump Force One?” the pitch read. “Before becoming the greatest President of all time, I traveled the Country in my plane, known as Trump Force One. I have a very important update on my plane but I need to trust that you won’t share it with anyone: my team is building a BRAND NEW Trump Force One.” The email blast came shortly after it was reported that Trump’s flight out of New Orleans on Saturday was forced to make an emergency landing.

3/13/2022,"A rare ""Harry Potter"" first edition was sold at auction for $90,000 on Wednesday. The seller almost threw the book out because it came out without a dust cover, he said, per reports. To preserve the ""poor quality"" pages, he refused to let his daughter read the book and shielded it from sunlight for 25 years. A British father who nearly threw out a rare Harry Potter first edition has sold it at auction for £69,000 ($89,966), according to reports. The seller, a 68-year-old paper merchant director from West Sussex, England, pre-ordered the first edition of JK Rowling's ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" from a bookstore in 1997, according to the British broadcaster ITV. He bought it for £12.99 ($16.94) but almost returned it because it came without a dust jacket, the unnamed seller told ITV. ""I'm a collector, and, being the first edition, I expected it to have one,"" he said, according to the broadcaster. ""I decided to keep the book on the toss of a coin. It was a moment of destiny."" The seller later found out the hardback first issues of the ""Philosopher's Stone,"" called the ""Sorcerer's Stone"" in the US, did not come with a dust cover. The 68-year-old went through great efforts to preserve the first edition because the paper in the book was ""poor quality,"" he said, per the Stoke Sentinel. It included keeping it in darkness for 25 years to stop the sunlight from turning the pages brown, the local media outlet reported. He also made sure that it was never read, much to his daughter's dismay, the Stoke Sentinel said. ""A year after I bought it, with Harry Potter excitement growing at my daughter's school, she asked if she could read it. I said, 'no, absolutely not,'"" the seller said, per the Sentinel. Instead, he added, he bought her another copy. The book sold to an online American buyer after a fierce bidding war on Wednesday at Hansons Auctioneers' saleroom, ITV reported. ""This is the highest hammer price we have achieved so far and deservedly so,"" said auctioneer Jim Spencer, per ITV.""It was the best hardback first edition of 'Philosopher's Stone' I have ever seen.""
