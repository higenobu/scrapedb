12/22/2021,"With the metaverse beginning to look less like science fiction and more like (virtual) reality, big businesses are refusing to be left behind. “Going forward, there will be many companies who try to claim they got a piece of the metaverse,” Jim Cramer said on his show last month. Think of the metaverse as a massive, persistent online world where people can interact, often through virtual or augmented reality headsets. Numerous companies are exploring the idea, but Cramer points to four that “are currently doing the best work.” Here’s a look at the Mad Money host’s picks — plus one more outside-the-box idea for investors. This one shouldn’t come as a surprise. The company formerly known as Facebook is one of the main reasons why everyone is talking about metaverse today. As it stands, Meta largely remains a social-media company. Facebook’s monthly active users grew 6% year-over-year to 2.91 billion in Q3. Factoring in Meta’s other platforms — namely Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp — the number of active users on at least one product totaled 3.58 billion. That said, the company has many endeavors beyond social media, including virtual and augmented reality headsets and smart glasses. It sees the metaverse as “a hybrid of today’s online social experiences, sometimes expanded into three dimensions or projected into the physical world.” Shares have climbed 24% this year to $326 apiece. If that’s too steep, you can use a popular investing app to buy fractions of shares with as much money as you are willing to spend. With the chip shortage expected to last well into next year — pinching the supply of new cars and other devices — chipmakers continue to fire on all cylinders. Nvidia shares have more than doubled year-to-date. And since the company is famous for its powerful graphics chips, Cramer sees Nvidia as a key metaverse play. In the three months ended Oct. 31, Nvidia’s revenue soared 50% year-over-year to a record $7.1 billion. Adjusted earnings came in at $1.17 per share, up 60% from a year ago. Growth is expected to continue. For the current fiscal quarter, management is projecting $7.4 billion in revenue. This game developer enables users to make block-based worlds and games without needing to know how to code. It also allows creators to get paid through an in-game currency called Robux. In Q3, the platform had 47.3 million average daily active users, up 31% year-over-year. Revenue rose 102% year-over-year to $509.3 million. Cramer likes Roblox because it is “a lot of fun” and has its “own internal metaverse already.” Roblox went public in March through a direct listing and closed at $69.50 on its first day of trading. Shares surged to over $140 apiece in November but have since come back down to around $100. If you don’t like that kind of roller coaster ride, remember you can always build a diversified portfolio of blue-chip stocks just by using your “spare change.” This video game software developer recently acquired the visual effects studio behind the Avatar and Lord of the Rings movies — and Cramer is keen. “Imagine being able to be an avatar of the person who made up the Avatar,” he said on his show. Unity shares had a solid run from May to November but have pared some of the gains in recent weeks. Trading at $136 per share, the stock is actually down 5.5% year to date. That could give contrarian investors something to think about, especially considering how fast the business is growing. In Q3, Unity earned $286.3 million of revenue, representing a 43% increase year-over-year. The company also generated $34.2 million of free cash flow, which more than tripled the $10.9 million it generated in the year-ago period. While they’re certainly exciting, metaverse plays remain highly speculative. Even Wall Street experts aren’t right 100% of the time. Don’t forget that diversification is key — and you don’t have to stay in the stock market to get it. If you want to invest in something with high return potential that’s insulated from the violent swings of the stock market, consider this overlooked asset: fine art. Contemporary artwork has outperformed the S&P 500 by a commanding 174% over the past 25 years, according to the Citi Global Art Market chart. And on a scale of -1 to +1 (with 0 representing no link at all), their correlation was just 0.12 over the past 25 years. Investing in art by the likes of Banksy and Andy Warhol used to be an option only for the ultra rich, like Cramer. But with a new investing platform, you can invest in iconic artworks, too, just like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates do. This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

12/22/2021,"The new week kicked off on a negative note, as all 3 major indexes pulled back from record highs. The uncertainty about the COVID-19 Omicron variant cast a pall over investors already cautious about the impact of rising inflation. But according to RBC chief US equity strategist Lori Calvasina, investors shouldn’t get too worked up. In fact, Calvasina takes a guardedly optimistic view of 2022. At the bottom line, Calvasina writes, “We continue to expect 2022 to be a year of solid but more moderate returns in the S&P 500 than what we’ve experienced in 2021.” But how she gets there commands some interest. Calvasina notes, “Most of our economic tests suggest that the S&P 500 should end up north of 5,100 – a reminder that the strong economy that empowers the Fed to move should ultimately win out.” That would suggest a 12% gain on the S&P index; while significantly lower than this year’s 21% gain, it’s definitely enough to keep investors in the black. With that outlook in mind, RBC has tapped two high-yield dividend stocks (yielding 9% or better) as Buying propositions going into 2022. While these are usually defensive portfolio positions, dividend stocks do have the advantage of ensuring an income stream no matter what the market conditions. Let's take a closer look. Annaly Capital Management (NLY) The first of RBC’s picks that we’ll check out is Annaly Capital, a real estate investment trust (REIT). This is a logical place to look for high-yield dividends, as REITs have a history of offering outsized dividends; Annaly is simply typical in that respect. In other respects, however, it is not so common. The company is mortgage REIT, meaning its portfolio is composed of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, rather than direct ownership of real estate. The company is one of the largest mortgage REITs in the business. Annaly boasts a market cap of $11.2 billion and has $94 billion in total assets, which include $14 billion in permanent capital and $9.8 billion in unencumbered assets. The company’s investment portfolio is split, 70% in long-term fixed-rate agency investment and 30% in shorter-term credit. Looking at Annaly’s recent performance, we see that in Q3, ‘earnings available for distribution’ (EAD) came in at 28 cents per share. This was down 2 cents from the prior quarter, and down 4 cents from the year-ago quarter – but it was more than enough to cover the 22-cent common share dividend payout. The dividend payment declared on December 9 for Q4, with payment set for January 31. At that rate, the dividend annualizes to 88 cents and gives an impressive dividend yield of 11%. This should be enough to attract investors, as divided yields across the broader markets are currently averaging just 1.3%. Markets are looking at changes in the near future, of the type that are likely to impact a mortgage REIT like Annaly. Specifically, the Federal Reserve is going to pull back its easy money policies (start the so-called taper), and likely raise rates in the bargain. Getting ready for those shifts, RBC's Kenneth Lee believes that Annaly is well-prepared. He writes of the company: “NLY continues to increase capital allocation towards credit assets, ahead of a Fed taper, and gradually build up its MSR portfolio, which could be a benefit in a rising rate environment. Management continues to take a conservative posture, with the ability to take advantage of any investment opportunities in the n-t. We continue to favor NLY's diversified operating model and ability to pivot between attractive opportunities.” In line with his optimistic take, Lee rates NLY an Outperform (i.e. Buy). Lee's $9.50 price target conveys his confidence in NLY's ability to climb 23% higher by the end of 2022. Based on the current dividend yield and the expected price appreciation, the stock has ~34% potential total return profile. (To watch Lee’s track record, click here) Overall, the analyst consensus here is a Moderate Buy, based on 8 reviews that include 3 Buys and 5 Holds. The stock’s average price target of $8.86 suggests ~15% upside from the current share price of $7.72. (See NLY stock analysis on TipRanks) Chimera Investment Corporation (CIM) The second dividend stock, to round out our look at RBC’s picks, is another REIT, Chimera investment. Like Annaly, Chimera is a mortgage REIT, with a portfolio of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. Chimera’s investments are mainly in residential mortgage loans, residential mortgage-backed securities, and asset securitization. The company currently manages over $16 billion in assets. Over the past four quarters, Chimera has seen revenues stabilize between $220 million and $280 million, after higher volatility during the corona crisis of the previous four quarters. The most recent financial report, for 3Q21, showed $220 million at the top line. EPS was positive, and while it was down from Q2, the 42 cents reported as ‘earnings available for distribution’ beat the forecast by 6 cents, or 16%, and was up 27% year-over-year. The earnings beat wasn’t the only good news. With 42 cents per share available, the company was easily able to afford the 33-cent per common share dividend payment. The dividend yields 9%, based on its $1.32 annualized payment. The company has a reliable dividend payment history going back to 2007. Once again, RBC's Kenneth Lee is bullish, writing: “Favorable loan pricing drove meaningful book value accretion in the quarter. Mgmt continues to believe seasoned RPLs [reperforming loans] represent an attractive investment opportunity. Strong housing market fundamentals remain supportive of favorable mortgage credit performance.” Lee’s comments support his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and he gives the stock an $18 price target that indicates room for a 12-month upside of ~26%. There are only 2 recent reviews of this stock; Lee’s on the bullish side, and another on the Hold side. This gives CIM a Moderate Buy rating. With the stock’s price listing at $14.34, the average price target of $18 – matching Lee’s – suggests a one-year upside potential of ~26%.
