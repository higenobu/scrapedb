2/27/2022,"This year marks the 150th anniversary of the birth of English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams. Manchester features prominently in celebrations of his music over the coming months. The Hallé and the BBC Philharmonic share a complete cycle of his symphonies, and the latter orchestra, under Mark Wigglesworth, kicked off proceedings this weekend with a programme examining two essential Vaughan Williams themes – war and the pastoral. Those subjects meet head on in the Third Symphony (published as The Pastoral in 1922, not numbered until later); a work that emits an unease borne of wartime trauma. Vaughan Williams described the Pastoral as cast “in four movements, all of them slow”. It’s a curious work, and one that the Philharmonic and Wigglesworth never managed to properly unpack. After an opening hampered by rhythmic drift (a persistent problem through the evening), the eerie solos of the second movement seemed divided in vision – the trumpet, imitating a bugle, deliberately sculpted and full of mellow vibrato; the horn reply edgier and closer to the natural tuning exploited by Britten. Only in the final movement did the symphony’s elegiac but unsettled character begin to shine through. Even then, the performance didn’t definitively answer the ambiguous questions posed by the composer. Were the distant wordless tones of tenor Alessandro Fisher that framed the last movement those of a ghostly soldier or something more serene, a Delian song of the high hills? Either way, they needed to be lighter. In this particular programme, Ravel’s influence shone through, especially in Vaughan Williams’ lush orchestration of On Wenlock Edge. That inspiration is partly what weakens this version, burying the soloist during the expanse of Bredon Hill. Fisher doesn’t quite have the English song sound nailed – the vowels were frequently Italianate, the timbre heavier – but his warm and easy stage presence complemented some stylish playing from the Philharmonic’s strings in the cycle’s busier sections.The Fifth Symphony was engaged and energetic through the bouncy rhythms of the Scherzo, but lacking in collective direction in the great deal of slow music that surrounds them. A puzzling start to this thought-provoking composer’s 150th year.

2/27/2022,"Two days ahead of his first State of the Union address, with war raging in Ukraine and inflation rising at home, Joe Biden’s approval rating hit a new low in a major US poll. The survey from the Washington Post and ABC News put Biden’s approval rating at 37%. The fivethirtyeight.com poll average pegs his approval rating at 40.8% overall. The Post-ABC poll found that 55% of respondents disapproved of the president’s performance, with 44% strongly disapproving. Partisan divides were evident, with 86% of Republicans and 61% of independents disapproving while 77% of Democrats approved of Biden’s performance in 13 months in office. The poll followed others which have sounded warnings for Biden, including a Harvard survey which found a majority of Americans saying Russia would not have invaded Ukraine if Donald Trump was still in the White House. Fox News, meanwhile, found that more Democrats had a negative view of Trump and more Republicans disapproved of Biden than either did of Vladimir Putin. Biden faces strong political headwinds as midterm elections loom. The party in the White House usually suffers in its first midterm contest. According to the Post-ABC poll, 50% of Americans want Republicans – the party whose supporters attacked Congress on 6 January 2021 – to take control on Capitol Hill. Most analysts expect that at least the House will fall to the GOP, though intra-party divisions, particularly over Trump and his political ambitions, could yet damage Republicans in November. Biden has implemented wide-ranging sanctions against Russia and Putin himself, helped marshal world opinion against Russia and sent US troops to allies in Europe. Nonetheless, the Post-ABC poll found that 47% of respondents disapproved of the president’s handling of the Ukraine crisis. Russia invaded as the poll was being conducted this week. The knock-on effects of the Ukraine war on the US economy are widely feared. In the Post-ABC poll, Biden’s approval rating on economic matters stood at the same low level as his overall approval rating, 37%. Three-quarters of respondents rated the US economy negatively. The Post and ABC also said Biden’s approval on handling the coronavirus pandemic continues to slide, with 44% approving and 50% disapproving. The poll also asked about two Republican attack lines: that Biden is not tough enough to stand up to Putin and that at 79 he is not mentally sharp enough to meet the demands of the job. “On the question of whether he is a strong leader,” the Post reported, “59% say no and 36% say yes – closely aligned with his overall approval rating. Among independents, 65% say he is not strong. “On an even more personal question, 54% say they do not think Biden has the mental sharpness it takes to serve as president, while 40% say he does.”",News/US news,"Joe Biden’s approval rating hits new low at 37%, poll finds",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/27/joe-biden-approval-rating-hits-new-low-poll
2/27/2022,"The French president, Emmanuel Macron, is expected to launch his campaign for re-election this week in a race shaken by the war in Ukraine, with key candidates under attack over previous pro-Russia stances. Macron has left the official declaration of his candidacy to the last minute because of the war, but he must make a move before the 4 March deadline to register. “This war will last,” Macron warned as he cut short his visit to the Paris agricultural fair this weekend, which is usually one of the key fixtures of the political calendar. There are only six weeks until the first-round presidential vote on 10 April, with the war in Ukraine the biggest international crisis to have hit a French presidential race in decades. Polls show Macron can win a second term, but there is a rise in support for far-right identity politics in France, with two far-right candidates in the race: Marine Le Pen, who is running for a third time, and a newcomer, the TV pundit Éric Zemmour, who has convictions for incitement to racial hatred. Both Le Pen and Zemmour have been challenged over their previous pro-Kremlin stances and have been criticised for backpeddling after the Russian invasion. Le Pen, who Macron defeated with 66% of the votes in the presidential final in 2017, is in the lead position to face him again in the final round, according to polls. But Le Pen accepted a loan from a Russian bank in 2014 to fund her 2017 campaign during which she paid a high-profile visit to Putin, praising him. Since the Russian invasion, she has been criticised by other candidates for her earlier pro-Russia stance. In a statement, she called for “an immediate end to military operations” and said the invasion must be “condemned without ambiguity”. Zemmour, who had downplayed the risk of war and suggested last year that Putin was not an aggressor, but was instead being treated aggressively by the international community, said he “condemned without reservation” what he called Russia’s “unjustifiable” military intervention. Jean-Luc Mélenchon, the hard-left presidential candidate, has in recent days pulled ahead of other candidates on the divided left, according to polls. He condemned the Russian invasion “as an extremely serious act of war” and “an unacceptable violation of the principles of international law”. But he was forced to defend his long-term position of France staying “non-aligned”, insisting in a live TV interview: “I have never supported Vladimir Putin, ever.” The Russian invasion has become a key issue for political debate. Clément Beaune, the Europe minister and Macron ally, said Le Pen, Zemmour and Mélenchon were “prisoners of their own contradictions and backpedalling” and were neither “coherent nor credible”. Valérie Pécresse, who is standing for Nicolas Sarkozy’s Les Républicains party, said at a rally this weekend that the war in Ukraine was “a turning point” in the French presidential campaign because it had allowed “masks to fall” and revealed what she called shameful geopolitical positions of rival candidates. She criticised Zemmour, Le Pen and Mélenchon and called them “discredited”. But Pécresse, who has slipped in the polls, had been under pressure over the stance of Sarkozy’s former prime minister, François Fillon. On the board of two large Russian energy firms, Fillon had been criticised for saying, just as Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, that “the west won’t listen” to Moscow’s demands concerning Nato. Fillon announced in the Journal du Dimanche on Sunday that he would quit the petrochemical firm Sibur and oil company Zarubezhneft.",News/World news,"Macron to launch re-election race, as rivals face pro-Russia allegations",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/macron-to-launch-re-election-race-as-rivals-face-pro-russia-allegations
2/27/2022,"Boris Johnson has appointed the combative election strategist David Canzini as part of his attempts to restore his battered reputation amid new claims that Downing Street lockdown parties regularly descended into “carnage”. Canzini, a key ally of the political strategist Lynton Crosby, is due to start work in Downing Street on Monday. The pair worked for the former prime minister Theresa May before turning on her in 2018 His new role as deputy chief of staff is expected to involve winning over disgruntled backbenchers and coming up with an election-winning strategy. Tory MPs have been encouraged by Boris Johnson’s handling of the Ukraine crisis, but more are expected to submit letters of no confidence in the prime minister if he is served with a penalty notice as part of the police investigation into lockdown parties. The Sunday Times reports that one party on 18 December 2020 became so raucous that red wine was sprayed on the walls of rooms in Downing Street. Staffers were also reported to have been photographed sitting on each others laps, at the event. The paper said one source alleged that drinks events often ended in “carnage”. Canzini has been linked for weeks with a formal role in Johnson’s revamped team, but it was reported last month that he was insisting on a clearout of Downing Street in the wake of the “partygate” scandal before taking up any new job. Canzini will be deputy to the new chief of staff, Steve Barclay, who replaced Dan Rosenfield after his resignation over partygate. He will work alongside two other deputy chiefs of staff: Simone Finn and Ben Gascoigne. Canzini’s appointment comes after the confirmation that two more senior Downing Street advisers, Henry Newman and Henry Cook, will be leaving No 10. Until Friday Canzini, a former Tory party campaign director, was a director at Crosby’s CT Group. His profile page on the company’s website is no longer available. Canzini worked on the “chuck Chequers” campaign – a series of Facebook adds overseen by Crosby that helped undermine Theresa May’s approach to Brexit in 2018. It came just after Johnson’s resignation from May’s government. Canzini is admired by rightwing Tories in the lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group and the Brexit-backing European Research Group (ERG). David Jones, the deputy chair of the ERG, told the Sunday Telegraph: “David Canzini is one of the shrewdest political operators in the UK. We had all been pressing for a root-and-branch review of No 10. To be fair to the PM, he did exactly that. “He got rid of some people who were not serving him well and is replacing them with people such as Steve Barclay, and particularly David Canzini, who people have got a lot of confidence in. I think that is going to change the narrative completely.” Canzini cultivates a “hardman” reputation. On Twitter he goes by the name @DCGrumpy and uses a profile picture of Darth Vader. He has used the network recently to spar with Theresa May’s former chief of staff Gavin Barwell and the Labour-supporting football pundit Gary Neville. Last month Johnson attempted to reassure MPs of his plans to reset his administration by saying he had rehired Crosby. But it later emerged that Crosby, who is known as the “Wizard of Oz” for his successful 2015 election strategy, will not be taking an official job but will instead occasionally advise Johnson from his base in Australia.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson appoints combative election strategist David Canzini ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/27/boris-johnson-appoints-combative-election-strategist-david-canzini

2/27/2022,"Ministers are to launch a campaign of “nudging and cajoling” to combat religious segregation in education in Northern Ireland, after figures revealed just 7% of schools officially offered integrated education. The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said he wanted to see an acceleration in the number of schools opting for integrated status, believing it was an important part of the post-conflict journey of healing. “This was one of the factors that people set out in the Belfast Good Friday agreement [BGFA] itself. We are 23 years on and still … such a small percentage of the population is able to be part of and benefit from integrated education. I think it’s just pretty poor progress,” said Lewis. “We are in a situation where still, people in Northern Ireland first meet a Protestant or Catholic when they go to work or university. [Segregated education] just isn’t going to ever drive full reconciliation.” Lewis said he was taken aback by the low percentage of schools offering integrated education when he first acquired the Northern Ireland portfolio, but also by the challenges involved in changing into an official integrated institution. His comments chime with the experience of one headteacher now waiting nine months for Stormont ministerial approval to change his school into an integrated institution. Ricky Massey, 46, took over as headteacher at Glengormley high school in 2018. It had an enrolment capacity for 1,250 pupils but numbers had fallen to 665. “I was born and raised in the Protestant tradition in south-east Belfast and, without any exaggeration, the very first time I encountered a Catholic was when I had a part-time job at the age of 17. And I knew he was a Catholic because his name was Seamus,” said Massey. “I thought: I certainly wouldn’t want that for my children.” The school was also predominantly Protestant (72%), not reflective of the mix in the town which is 49% Protestant and 46% Catholic, he said. With a slight sense of despair, Massey watched from the school gates as children in a multitude of uniforms boarded buses to attend school nine miles away in Belfast. “I asked myself: why?” This cemented his determination to change the school into “invitational to those of all faiths and none”, enabling local children to attend local schools regardless of their background. “While segregation is in place, no matter what the reason is, it will have a negative impact upon developing peace. Young people spend most of their day in a school setting, and if they are segregated you can’t expect them to learn from one another and grow together,” he adds. Massey has now been waiting since last summer for approval to transform the school into an integrated secondary. He is concerned that validation will not be granted before applications for secondary places close in a few days time, even though an overwhelming 71% of parents back the plan. Since its foundation in 1921, Northern Ireland’s education system has largely consisted of state-controlled schools, mainly attended by Protestant pupils, and Catholic maintained schools, almost exclusively attended by Catholics, says the Integrated Education Fund (IEF), a not-for-profit organisation supporting integrated education. The first planned integrated school opened its doors 41 years ago but, in the ensuing decades, only 68 integrated schools followed – out of more than 1,000 in Northern Ireland, according to the IEF. Lewis was similarly struck by his first engagement as Northern Ireland secretary at a youth club, when he learned children did not see friends made at the club during or after school. “That was actually quite poignant,” said Lewis. “It’s not just about the pupils. It’s also about the parents … the more time we spend together, the more time you realise the cliche is true; that we always have far more in common than ever divides us.” Lewis is currently reviewing funding for the sector as the main plank of his three-point plan. He is also seeking to open up the “airspace” to foster debate about integrated education, whileintending to use Westminster input where he can. “I do believe in nudging and cajoling. Education is a devolved area, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t have an opinion and we don’t have a right as a co-guarantor and co-signatory of the BGFA to do all we can.”",News/UK news,UK to campaign against religious segregation in Northern Irish schools,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/27/uk-to-campaign-against-religious-segregation-in-northern-irish-schools
2/27/2022,"Can you be a Buddhist as well as a Christian? Can a non-theist and theist perspective operate together hand in hand? Anna M St Clair Send new questions to nq@theguardian.com. I don’t see why not. Western society expects us to believe six dozen contradictory things at once already, so what’s one more? ReidMalenfant My son is two and so far he prefers Buddha. I’m guessing it has something to do with Buddha’s superior PR department since Buddha looks far happier than Jesus in the majority of depictions. Polvfr Probably got something to do with the whole not being nailed to a big plus sign thing. asparagusnextleft Yes, I would think so, but only because Buddhism tends not to have the same kind of rigid rules about beliefs and practices as Abrahamic religions. Where I lived, shrines to local animist traditional spirits were frequently within the walls of Buddhist pagodas, for example, and there was seen to be no conflict. BluebellWood My answer to that is of course you can. I trained in theology and was a “Christian” minister for 19 years before becoming a gardener. This career move allowed me time to develop the sort of reflective practices – with the support of a Buddhist group – that Christianity used to encourage as non-discursive prayer. In my tenure as a teacher of clergy we often had lunchtime sessions of meditation, informed by Christian and Buddhist teachings. Now I’m retired I do a lot of walking and frequently use churchyards for meditation or, if the church is open, the church itself. While meditating in a Christian setting no one is going to tap you on the shoulder and say: “I hope this silence is not a heresy.” One of the loveliest experiences I’ve had was a pilgrimage to Bardsey Island. I acted as a guide for the Venerable Bodhidhamma of Satipanya. We meditated in the medieval churches along the route and rested under the churchyard yews. Graham Murphy, Liverpool I’m married to someone who attends Quaker meetings and Buddhist meditation sessions, so yes, you can. There is apparently quite a lot of crossover between the Buddhists and Quakers in Britain. In traditionally Buddhist countries in Asia it’s quite common to practise another religion alongside Buddhism. In Japan they reckon that Shinto does weddings best, and Buddhism the best funerals. exlangrandeflaneuse Forty years ago, I was an Anglican, having grown up as a Methodist. At a gathering about church unity with a Catholic bishop, I asked the question: “Can one be both an Anglican and a Catholic?” His was a simple, one sentence reply: “That’s the kind of question that makes me want to hide behind the dustbins.” Although I am now a Catholic, I still attend some Anglican services – and encourage other Catholics to do the same. (Rev Dr) Rodney Schofield A good question, but the brief answer is no. The two religions can learn from each other, but they are in complete disagreement about the key question: what happens to the individual human being after they die. Tony Buck There is a well-established tradition that Jesus’s “lost years” in the Bible account of his life were spent in India studying Buddhism (see here for an intro to this notion). The story has it that he returned to Kashmir rather than ascending to heaven, and you can even visit his tomb there. mattion A young Buddhist priest once urged me to persevere with Christianity to learn compassion and with Buddhism to learn wisdom. I appreciated his advice, especially because he mixed it with some flattery. John Swindle, Honolulu Buddha teaches self-salvation through practice; Jesus allows you to project your holy self on to him, which is far more helpful if you need to anthropomorphise God’s infinite love in order to feel saved by an external and omnipotent being. If you are psychologically self sufficient, Buddha may be enough; if you need a helping hand Jesus is yer man-God. That’s my experience anyway, as a Buddhist first and then a Christian. GreySocksAndLentils Twenty-four years ago, I attended a three-day meeting at Bodhgaya, the spiritual centre of the Buddhist world. The meeting was a dialogue between the Dalai Lama and Lawrence Freeman, the spiritual director of the World Community for Christian Meditation. Both stated categorically that it is not possible for one person to be a Christian and a Buddhist. At that point, I had been a Buddhist for 18 years. In 2009, attending church with my wife, I had a significant conversion experience on Christmas Eve; after some serious discussion I was given permission by the vicar of our local Anglican church to receive communion, and have done so ever since. I took Lent and other aspects of Christian practice very seriously; and recently undertook the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela (reciting the rosary most of the way). The one thing I have (so far) drawn the line at has been receiving baptism. Throughout all this I have continued to study, practise and teach Buddhism in the Tibetan tradition – one of the more explicitly religious forms of Buddhism – and this is by a long stretch my main spiritual practice. My conviction has deepened that the essence of these two religions is the same; the fact that one expresses its view of ultimate reality in negative and the other in positive terms does not, for me, imply a difference in the essentially spiritual content of the practice of each. David Midgley The logical answer is no. How can someone who believes creation had a beginning also believe life is a timeless cycle of birth, death and rebirth without beginning. How can they believe in the grace of god and also believe no god can alter karma? How can they believe that Jesus is the only path to salvation and good deeds alone will not get you into heaven and also believe good deeds will help for a better rebirth? How can they believe in the final judgment and an end to creation and also believe in a never-ending cycle of life? Mind you, I struggle to understand how anyone can believe anything without good reason to believe it. They can take on board certain elements of it that align with their Christian faith, but if it aligns with their existing faith, surely they’ve already taken it on board from their existing faith, so really all they are doing is agreeing with certain elements of it. Even atheists agree with certain elements of theistic teachings, doesn’t mean we are both theist and atheist. GodlessHeathens These schoolboy-debate-style arguments focus on doctrine, not practice, and doctrinal judgments can be very far from the heart of spirituality, which the mystic core of most traditions share. For example, some of the desert father practices, or the teachings of the great Christian monastics, are essentially forms of meditation. mattion I don’t think they can. God or gods are not the problem, but the nature of a human being. Christians (and so-called Hindus) believe in atman or soul. Buddhist believe in anatman, which is there is no soul, but a impermanent, everchanging, interdependent pattern as it were that continues life to life. Similar to the way you cannot say this particular piece of the river is its river essence (soul), rather the overall flow of water is called a river. So two very different concepts. KMFedorov Christians may not think it is possible to practise another religion, that is a subject up for debate. However, a friend who teaches in Bangkok at a Christian school can verify that hundreds of Buddhists there attempt to practise the values of Christianity while actively being a Buddhist. In my opinion, many make better Christians than those I’ve seen who take it as their primary religion. Mckenzie I consider myself to be both Buddhist and Christian. From an agnostic/atheist background, I developed/discovered an affinity for Christian mysticism on a Buddhist retreat. I’d say the answer to the question depends on your perspective on both Buddhism and Christianity – and there are myriad perspectives on both. From a more contemplative, mystical perspective, meditation practices as taught by the Buddha can certainly lead to mystical states of an all-pervading sense of non-dual consciousness, that can be perceived/coloured in different ways – eg as all-pervading love, all-pervading awareness, or as God/God-consciousness. At this level I see no conflict between the teachings of the Buddha and those of Jesus. The myths and stories in both religions can then be appreciated, but not taken literally. silentwatersThis whole discussion is likely plagued by the “one true Scotsman fallacy”, but this seems quite a stretch to be honest. Christianity relies on the incarnation and atonement and resurrection. These are most definitely regarded as “real” by most Christians. (Their rather convoluted relationship with Jewish eschatology makes an interesting comparison.) I can see why jettisoning this allows all sorts of parallels to be made (and I am totally in favour of dialogue and common ground), but sadly this seems intellectually disingenuous. martifingers I think that the logical answer is yes. They are both sets of philosophical and ethical practices that do not have definitive versions. I find precepts from both Buddhism and Christianity compatible and of use. Ultimately it’s not what you call yourself in life but your actions that define you. wenders14 Well, as the old joke from Northern Ireland goes: “Are you a Catholic Buddhist or a Protestant Buddhist?” Dave Crook As many have pointed out, it depends what you mean by Christianity and by Buddhism. There are many manifestations of both. As western culture has become more materialistic (ie excluding metaphysics, and not just in love with buying things), new variants of Christianity and Buddhism have developed. These do away with the need to believe in, say, the virgin birth or resurrection on the one hand, and karma and nirvana on the other hand, and has in effect turned them into philosophies bordering on lifestyle guides. How far their founders would recognise these teachings is another matter, of course … dowland Thomas Merton says yes. He was a Trappist monk and student/teacher of eastern ways of liberation. The Buddha offered a path to liberation from suffering while you are alive today. His teachings did not concern what happens after death. From early transcriptions from Pali and Sanskrit, the Buddha replied, when asked about existence after death: “I do not take up any of these ideas” and: “I have nothing to do with beliefs or theories.” One can follow a religion that supports a need for salvation and also learn how to reduce anxiety and angst while still alive. I can discern no inherent incompatibility. Celticbuddha For Zen Buddhists, one might say that someone with faith in Jesus can practice Buddhism, living gently. Someone who does not personally believe in Jesus can practice Buddhism and live gently. In any case, seek wisdom and compassion, and live gently. Jundo Cohen I was baptised a Christian and turned to Buddhism in later life. I have been wrestling with this question for some time. Gautama did not teach Buddhism; Jesus did not teach Christianity. These are forms that have developed to better understand, cultivate and apply these teachings. There are many similarities between these forms and some irreconcilable differences, at an intellectual level. In the silence of meditation and contemplation there is no distinction. In terms of daily practice I find that one eventually inclines towards the form, the Way, that is most helpful and conducive to one’s growth. But the door can remain open, and can open wider and wider, I would say, until there is no door.

2/27/2022,"James Scrivens is head mushroom grower at the fungal research project Coed Talylan We’ve seen a big demand for grow-kits and cultivation courses over the last couple of years. There’s really no excuse for not growing mushrooms if you have a garden. As well as producing a delicious crop, mushroom mulches (the layers of material in which fungi grow) keep down weeds, retain moisture and help build the soil to grow healthy plants. There are various ways of growing mushrooms at home, but we’ll focus on mulches here. A good species to start with is the garden giant, also known as the wine cap or king stropharia. These are big, meaty mushrooms, delicious in stews, easy to culture and quick to grow (make sure to pick them before they get too big and lose their flavour). Start in March or April to avoid the risk of frost. Choose a semi-shaded spot, ideally among fruit bushes or trees, which will benefit from the mulch. Get your hands on mushroom spawn. Spawn is a substance, usually grain, that’s been treated with the fungal culture or mycelium you need to grow mushrooms. We sell it but it is available from farms or grow-kit shops. For the substrate, source two or three large cardboard boxes stripped of plastic and without too much ink; a couple of wheelbarrows of fresh woodchip (not more than a month old) containing more hardwood than softwood (call your local tree surgeons or landscape gardeners and ask if they have any); and a 1kg bag of straw, which you can get from a pet shop. For 1.5kg of mushroom spawn, prepare an area of 1-2m2 for the bed. Dig out any persistent weeds. Cover the ground with a layer of cardboard and saturate with water, piercing holes in the cardboard where water is pooling. Cast a third of the spawn over the surface, making occasional small islands, then cover evenly with 3cm depth of woodchip and water lightly. Create a second layer of cardboard, using smaller, torn-up strips, and thoroughly saturate. As before, cast the spawn and cover with 3cm of woodchip. Repeat the process to create a third layer. Finally, cover the bed with a layer of straw and water it once more thoroughly. Water every day for the first week, then every other day for the next three weeks, and once a month thereafter – unless there is enough rain. After four to eight months, the mycelium should have grown through the woodchip. Keep an eye on the bed when fruiting conditions are good – at temperatures of 14-18C, often when sunshine has followed rain. The mushrooms will be ready to pick after 48 hours of appearing. (Be sure to properly identify your garden giant mushroom: it should have a thick white stem, a burgundy to brown cap, greyish gills and black spores.) After two harvests, add a 5-10cm layer of woodchip before winter and cover with straw. You can do this for two-three years, after which it is best to make a new bed. You can easily propagate more beds by taking the myceliated woodchip from your original as your “spawn”. Or expand your horizons and try growing a different mushroom, such as oyster or wood blewits.Coed Talylan is a land trust with area dedicated to growing a diverse fungi population.

2/27/2022,"I have suffered from workplace bullying. While that alone might not seem unusual – 23% of the British workforce would say the same – the context probably does. I was bullied in a church. Controlling behaviour, you might say, should come as no surprise within a religious institution. Yet in my first post, in Liverpool, I worked with a senior priest who was the model manager: encouraging, efficient and kind. In fact, in normal circumstances, clergy come top of the polls that measure job satisfaction. But when it goes wrong, it can go very wrong indeed, and a new route is emerging for clergy wishing to stand up for their rights in the workplace: more and more are joining trade unions. It is true that more clergy in the Church of England, once deemed “the Tory party at prayer”, now tend to lean to the left, but they are not natural syndicalists. At one point, joining a union as a member of the clergy would have been unthinkable. The Rev Canon Paul Hamilton, rector of the Ingrave churches in Essex, has been involved with various disputes with his diocesan superiors, from challenging them on plans to evict a junior cleric and their family from housing owned by the diocese, to a debate about insecure headstones. Yet he tells me that for years, joining a union as a member of the clergy would have been inconceivable: “I just never thought I would need to.” His experiences changed his mind, and he has since become a union member. Now, however, the Anglican clerical membership of the faith workers’ branch of Unite stands at 1,500, 7.5 per cent of the active clergy in the Church of England. The Church of England Clergy Advocates (CECA), a professional association within the Unite branch, reported at the end of January that an average of 30 clergy were joining a month. One motivating factor is that clergy employment is an incredibly murky area. We are not employees, in the conventional sense, but exist under a system called “common tenure”. Historically, the ordinary clergy had ancient rights securing their position that could even include ownership of the physical church building. But now the church is increasingly treating clergy like ordinary employees – I was given a pdf contract rather than a piece of vellum detailing my ancient rights – but often without the protection that normally affords. Meanwhile, dioceses are increasingly using legal devices, such as making clergy “priests in charge” rather than rectors or vicars, so that the clergy on the ground cannot exercise their ancient rights. I often see younger clergy being assigned assistant priest posts, with contracts lasting between one and three years. These are entirely at the whim of the incumbent vicar, and their employment can be terminated at any time. There are some other forms of protection available – from informal pressure groups such as the Save the Parish campaign to formal protection from the insurance company Ecclesiastical, which can help a cleric facing the often clunking fist of the Church of England disciplinary process. But when things go wrong, clergy are often left with nowhere to turn. CECA was founded in 2012, and initially looked down upon. In church circles membership was regarded as the sign of a troublemaker, or of the overly politicised. However, the noticeable rise in unionisation reflects concerns on the ground about moves towards church reform. Several dioceses have announced swingeing cuts to clergy numbers, up to a third in some places; Hamilton’s diocese of Chelmsford laid out plans in 2020 to cut 61 posts. An infamous piece of Synod legislation, GS222, which seeks to make it considerably easier for dioceses to close churches and deprive clergy of livelihoods, has been stalled following protests from clergy and laity at the consultation stage. But it still looms as a possibility and, at the very least, is a worrying statement of intent. It is very telling that CECA reports a “significant” proportion of the House of Clergy, the legislative body that represents ordinary vicars in Synod and so has a closer eye on the central church authorities’ plans, are union members. Perhaps they know which way the wind is blowing. As it becomes clear that bishops and archdeacons don’t necessarily feel the obligations towards individual clergy that you might expect, if you have a romantic or idealised view of the church’s structures, a more formal, organised solidarity, as sought by other workers throughout the ages, increasingly looks like the only option. Some dioceses are excellent employers, some supervising clergy are assiduous and kind, some bishops are innately pastoral; but of course union membership doesn’t exist for the times when relationships are going well, and it is increasingly clear that clergy can no longer rely on goodwill alone. The church should welcome any organisations that seek to address the shortcomings inherent to any workplace – even if they seem unconventional. Its purpose may be to point to the Kingdom of Heaven, but we are all operating in a fallen world.

2/27/2022,"Ukraine’s embattled president has issued a call to foreign nationals who are “friends of peace and democracy” to travel to the country and fight against the Russian invasion. The appeal from President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, published on the Ukrainian presidency’s website early on Sunday, said the Ukrainian armed forces were in the process of setting up a foreign legion unit for international volunteers. “This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules and peaceful coexistence,” the statement said. “Anyone who wants to join the defence of Ukraine, Europe and the world can come and fight side by side with the Ukrainians against the Russian war criminals.” The call was repeated on Twitter by Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, and was expected to be the focus of his briefing for international media on Sunday afternoon. Interested volunteers have been told to contact the defence attache of the Ukrainian embassies in their home countries. According to a 2016 degree, foreigners have the right to join the Ukrainian army for military service on a voluntary basis, Zelenskiy’s statement said. Sunday’s appeal by a sovereign government for foreign reinforcements, however – reminiscent of international involvement in the Spanish civil war of the 1930s – is unprecedented in modern warfare. The UN says the three-day-old Russian invasion on multiple axes has already claimed 64 civilian lives. Russian ground forces have not advanced as quickly as feared, but fierce street fighting and aerial bombardment is under way in both the capital, Kyiv, and the country’s second largest city of Kharkiv. The world’s media has been flooded by images of Ukrainian citizens preparing Molotov cocktails in plastic bottles and learning how to use light arms as their only defences against the might of one of the world’s strongest armies. Poorly sourced “combat tips” and offers to pay for flights have also been circulating on a Reddit forum called “volunteersForUkraine”, where the announcement that Zelenskiy is creating a foreign legion was met with enthusiasm. “I just got out of active duty a few months ago. I plan to sell my car Monday and use the funds to purchase equipment and my plane ticket to krakow [sic]. From there I’ll find a way to the Ukrainian border,” posted one user, who claimed to be a US air force veteran from California. “To any of you with no combat experience like myself but with the training … Be prepared to not come back. I’ve accepted the fact that I’m going to die eventually. If it’s gonna happen at least it’ll be towards a cause I believe in.” The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said on Sunday that Britons who chose to go to Ukraine to fight would “absolutely” have her support. The remarks stand in contrast to the UK position on the war in Syria, where UK nationals who have travelled to fight either for or against Islamic State have faced prosecution on their return home. A small but growing number of Ukrainians living in the UK have made plans to go back to defend their homeland, including veterans of the war with Russia since 2014, community leaders told the Guardian earlier this week. On Saturday, the Ukrainian embassy in Israel also issued a specific callout for volunteers willing to fight on Kyiv’s behalf. In a Facebook post that was later deleted, the embassy asked people who “are ready to defend the sovereignty of Ukraine” to submit their personal details and a description of their military expertise in order to be contacted regarding opportunities to serve. Ukraine is home to at least 43,000 people who self-identify as Jewish and tens of thousands more with Jewish ancestry, making it one of the world’s biggest Jewish communities. About 1 million Ukrainian Jews were killed in the Holocaust, and 80% of the remaining Jewish population of 500,000 is believed to have migrated to Israel after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989, meaning that for many in Israel, the new war resonates deeply. The Ukrainian embassy in Tel Aviv did not respond to a request for information about how many people have signed up, but one Israel Defence Forces (IDF) soldier told the Walla News website on Sunday he was planning to fight in Ukraine after his demobilisation. “I came across the post and I couldn’t remain indifferent to what’s happening to the country that my grandfather, grandmother and parents lived in, a beautiful country that I toured less than three years ago,” said the soldier, who was identified as L. “The footage coming out of there has left me frustrated … I felt a burning desire to help. I’ve learned from this that we have a beautiful country and that we have to defend it,” he said. Another Israeli who took part in an anti-war protest in central Tel Aviv on Saturday night and gave his name as Vladimir told Israel’s Channel 13 News that his 10-month-old daughter was still in Ukraine, and he was prepared to join the Ukrainian army to protect his family. Israel has budgeted 10m NIS (£2.31m) for helping Jewish Ukrainian refugees and protecting Jewish institutions in the country, the defence ministry said. Preparations were being made for a new wave of immigration from Ukraine to Israel of between 10,000-15,000 people in the coming weeks.",News/World news,Ukraine appeals for foreign volunteers to join fight against Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/ukraine-appeals-for-foreign-volunteers-to-join-fight-against-russia
2/27/2022,"Ukrainian forces have repelled a Russian attempt to seize Kharkiv, the city’s governor has claimed, after fierce fighting and street battles with advancing Russian troops. Kharkiv’s governor, Oleh Synyehubov, said Ukrainian soldiers were “cleaning up” the eastern city. He said Russian soldiers were surrendering in groups of five to 10 and throwing their equipment in the middle of the road. “Control over Kharkiv is completely ours!” Synyehubov posted on Facebook. “A complete cleansing of the city from the enemy is happening. The Russian enemy is absolutely demoralised.” Earlier on Sunday, the governor said Russian light military vehicles had broken “into the city”, including in central areas. They arrived in the northern suburbs at 8am, he said. He urged all civilians to stay inside, adding: “Citizens of Kharkiv, don’t leave shelter, don’t use transport.” Videos on social media showed images of Russian troops moving through residential areas and past Soviet-era apartment blocks. Soldiers on foot used armoured vehicles as cover. Their vehicles were marked with Z, the symbol of Russia’s four-day invasion. Other footage suggested the Ukrainian military had inflicted losses. There were images of a destroyed Russian column and a skirmish in the south-east of the city. A group of Russian soldiers took refuge in an empty school, number 88, witnesses said, close to Traktornyi Zavod subway station. Ukrainian soldiers armed with Kalshnikovs and grenade launchers sheltered behind a wall and trees, emerging to open fire. There was fighting reported around Shevchenko Avenue. In another part of the city local fighters strolled around destroyed Russian vehicles, inspecting the damage and salvaging military equipment. The attempted Russian operation to seize Kharkiv followed a night of heavy bombardment. At least one multistorey apartment block was hit. Residents said the attacks were “massive and indiscriminate”, with a missile landing in a children’s playground next to a see-saw. Artem Volodymyrovich, a 31-year-old English teacher, said Russian units had advanced from the north. They passed Peremoha metro station, the final stop on the city’s green line, and headed towards the centre, he said, speaking from a basement shelter. “Diversionary Russian groups have been getting into Kharkiv. We can hear gunshots. Our army is still in the city. Ukrainians are still in control, volunteers are working, the mayor is in charge, and we are fighting back,” he said at 11am local time. Volodymyrovich said he was hiding in a basement with 30 others, mostly women, children and elderly people. One of the group was an electrician who had fixed the power supply, allowing people to charge their phones. It was his third night in a shelter, he said. “The bombing has been really heavy. The metro stopped working on Thursday afternoon and is now being used as a bomb shelter. The trains have been opened. People are sleeping in them because there isn’t enough space on the platforms.” The city would defeat occupying Russian forces, he predicted. “I think yes. We are at home. People are fighting for their own homes, their families, their loved ones. It’s invasion for them, defence for us.” He added: “I’m not a military guy. But if it comes to it I will take a fucking machine gun before I die like this and sit inside being shot, if they storm the basement. Better to die with arms in your hands.” Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to Ukraine’s interior minister, who posted videos of the battle on his Telegram channel, said the Russian army had overreached itself. “Kharkiv will become for Russians a Ukrainian Stalingrad,” he wrote. It was too early to say on Sunday whether Moscow would mount a further attempt to capture Kharkiv. The brutal bombardment of a city of 1.4 million people showed Russia was deliberately shelling civilians in suburban areas, local people said.

He said: “Again shooting, again bombardments of residential areas, and civilian infrastructure.” He added: “Today, there is not a single thing in the country that the occupiers do not consider an acceptable target. They fight against everyone. They fight against all living things – against kindergartens, against residential buildings and even against ambulances.” He said Russian forces were “firing rockets and missiles at entire city districts in which there isn’t and never has been any military infrastructure. “Vasylkiv, Kyiv, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kharkiv and many other towns in Ukraine are living in conditions that were last experienced on our lands during the second world war,” he said.",News/World news,Kharkiv governor claims Russian troops repelled from city,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/kharkiv-fighting-russia-ukraine-invasion
2/27/2022,"In a historic announcement to parliament the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has said a fund of €100bn (£85bn) will be set up immediately in order to boost the strength of the country’s armed forces, as he also announced a sustained increase in defence spending over the coming years. Scholz admitted that the urgency of the Ukraine crisis had forced the decision to invest in the German military, telling the emergency session of the Bundestag: “It is clear that we must invest significantly more in the security of our country, in order to protect our freedom and democracy.” He called it “Germany’s historical responsibility” to ensure that Vladimir Putin “does not turn the clocks back”. The move comes after the government made the surprise announcement on Saturday that it would be sending weapons and other supplies to Ukraine, including 1,000 anti-tank weapons, 500 surface-to-air Stinger missiles and thousands of gallons of petrol. The decision marks a historical break with Germany’s postwar pledge to not export weapons to conflict zones. Long-term defence spending is to be increased year on year by more than 2% of GDP, he said. It is currently about 1.5% with Germany having been under growing pressure from its Nato allies, in particular the US, to increase the amount for years. The existence of the special fund should be anchored in Germany’s constitution, Scholz said, in order to ensure it remained a guarantee beyond the life of the current parliament. Germany has long been criticised by its allies for its resistance to increasing its defence spending. This position has been reinforced by a strong pacifist sentiment amongst the electorate linked to Germany’s bloody Nazi past. In recent weeks the country was also under fire for having not offered enough material support in particular refusing to deliver lethal weapons to assist Ukraine to defend itself against Russia. But a turning point came on Saturday evening with the government’s the surprise announcement on weapons to Ukraine. It has also lifted certain restrictions on German-manufactured weapons being sent to conflict zones from third countries, such as Estonia and the Netherlands. The announcement to parliament was greeted with relief and surprise, with Scholz receiving a standing ovation on Sunday morning, even as some MPs mainly from the the Left party as well as the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) groaned in disapproval. During his half-hour address, Scholz said Putin’s decision to launch a war “marked a turning point in the history of our continent”. The military conflict would be a lengthy one, he said, stressing that he saw it as “Putin’s war” and “not a war of the Russian people”. He said the conflict would alter the world and called it “a catastrophe for Ukraine”, but said it would “also prove to be a catastrophe for Russia”. Scholz issued five “mandates for action”, including: the delivery of weapons to Ukraine, which he said “can be the only answer to Putin’s aggression”; supporting sanctions against Russian interests including the suspension of the Swift payment system; ensuring the war does not spill over into other countries, citing the importance of Nato’s article 5; a significant increase in German military spending as well as other strategic changes, including an effort to decrease German dependence on Russian gas, and the construction of two terminals allowing the import of liquid petroleum gas in the ports of Brunsbüttel and Wilhelmshaven. This follows his decision last week to suspend approval of the gas pipeline Nord Stream 2, in effect killing the multibillion-euro project. Finally, Scholz said he was determined to keep up the diplomatic effort. “We need as much diplomacy as possible, without being naive,” he said, adding that Germany would not refuse to hold talks with Russia. “Even in this extreme situation it is the job of diplomacy to keep open channels of communication,” he said. “Anything else would be irresponsible.”",News/World news,Germany to set up €100bn fund to boost its military strength,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/germany-set-up-fund-boost-military-strength-ukraine-putin
2/27/2022,"Vladimir Putin has ordered his military to put Russia’s nuclear deterrence forces on high alert in response to “aggressive statements” by Nato countries. The order came at a meeting between the president, the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and the chief of the general staff of the armed forces of Russia, Valery Gerasimov. “Senior officials of the leading Nato countries also allow aggressive statements against our country, therefore I order the minister of Defense and the chief of the general staff [of the Russian armed forces] to transfer the deterrence forces of the Russian army to a special mode of combat duty,” Putin said in televised comments. “Western countries aren’t only taking unfriendly actions against our country in the economic sphere, but top officials from leading Nato members made aggressive statements regarding our country. It is not immediately clear what the “special mode of combat duty” entails. Putin has warned foreign countries not to interfere in his invasion of Ukraine, saying it could lead to “consequences they have never seen”. He has positioned anti-air missiles and other advanced missile systems in Belarus and deployed his fleet to the Black Sea in an effort to prevent a western intervention in Ukraine. The US ambassador to the United Nations responded to the news from Moscow while appearing on CBS. “President Putin is continuing to escalate this war in a manner that is totally unacceptable,” Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said. “And we have to continue to condemn his actions in the most strong, strongest possible way.” The Russian invasion has left hundreds dead. Russia has launched missile strikes against buildings in Kyiv, Kharkiv and other major Ukrainian cities as it threatens an all-out assault not seen since the second world war. Kharkiv residents were urged to stay indoors by its governor, Oleg Sinegubov, who said “there has been a breakthrough in light equipment including in the central part of the city”. A nine-storey building was reportedly hit, with one woman killed. Russian forces also blew up a gas pipeline in the city, the Ukrainian state service of special communications said, prompting the government to warn of a potential “environmental catastrophe” and to urge people to protect themselves from the smoke by covering their windows. Air raid sirens sounded in Kyiv early on Sunday, hours after the US, Britain and European countries announced tougher sanctions targeting Russian banks, including barring some from the Swift international payments system.
