4/18/2022,"Entrepreneur Elon Musk’s ex-wife is about to have a ruff time in court. Justine Musk was married to the SpaceX founder from 2000 before they officially divorced in 2008. Although Justine has maintained a low profile compared to the Tesla founder, who has been making headlines for his intent to purchase the social media company Twitter, the media is about to be barking down her door. According to legal documents, obtained by The Blast, a DoorDash delivery driver by the name of Hayedeh Samadi filed a lawsuit against Musk’s ex-wife saying that her dog attacked her. And she wants that dog dead. The lawsuit was filed on Friday in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County. Samadi is filing a lawsuit for strict liability, general negligence, battery, and a host of other complaints. The lawsuit alleges that Samadi, who is a DoorDash delivery driver, was bitten by Justine’s dog when she attempted to make a delivery to her home on April 17, 2020. The dog is just referred to as the “Subject Dog” in the court papers and the breed or age of the dog was not disclosed in the documents. The court papers say that the Justine had “knowledge of the Subject Dog’s viciousness” when Samadi attempted to make a delivery to her Los Angeles home. Samadi alleges that Justine could have, and should have, removed the dog from the premises before she arrived with the delivery. She also alleges that Justine never informed her, or DoorDash, that she had a dog. The court documents state that Justine’s dog attacked Samedi “when [the] Plaintiff entered the property to deliver the food.” It’s not clear if the dog bit her when Justine opened her front door, or if the dog was already outside when the attack occurred. However, Samedi alleges that the attack left her with “permanent” injuries. Samadi alleges that the dog “inflicted serious and permanent personal injuries” to her. In addition to two dog bite abrasions on her left shin and left hip, Samadi claims that the attack left her with sharp left lower back pain that radiated down her left leg, which resulted in a tingling over the left leg. She says that she has also suffered aches in her left arm, elbow and left hand pain, aches in her left hip, and “severe anxiety” as a result of the attack. The court documents state that Samadi also incurred “non-economic damages, including but not limited to pain, suffering, anxiety, scarring, loss of enjoyment of life, inconvenience, frustration, and disability caused by this incident.” However, despite the trauma Samadi alleges that she suffered from the incident, she admitted in the court documents that she never filed a complaint with animal control for the “unprovoked animal attack.” Shockingly, Samadi is requesting “general, special, actual and compensatory damages” that include “necessary medical and related expenses” for “mental, emotional, and physical pain and suffering.” She is suing for past and future economic damages caused by the attack, as well as past and future non-economic, emotional damages. In addition, Samadi is also requesting that the court orders Justine’s dog to be seized, confined, and/or euthanized. She is also asking Justine to be fined punitive damages, accusing Justine of being aware of “her dog’s propensity of danger and viciousness.” The court papers allege that “Despite that knowledge, [the] Defendant did not take reasonable steps to prevent the harm to [Samadi].” She is requesting that the fate of Justine’s dog, and her recovery, be left to the hands of a jury, although it is likely that she will receive a settlement out of the court system. Justine Musk, nor her ex-husband, have yet to make a statement concerning the lawsuit at this time.",U.S./TheBlast,DoorDash Driver Wants Elon Musk’s Ex-Wife’s Dog Dead After Vicious Attack,https://news.yahoo.com/doordash-driver-wants-elon-musk-182023120.html
4/18/2022,"PARIS (Reuters) - French prosecutors said on Sunday they are examining a report by the European Union's anti-fraud agency accusing far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen and members of her party of misappropriating thousands of euros' worth of EU funds. Le Pen is challenging Emmanuel Macron in a presidential election with opinion polls showing Macron edging ahead in next Sunday's second round runoff. The Paris prosecutor's office confirmed that it was studying a report it received from the EU anti-fraud agency OLAF on March 11. Investigative website Mediapart wrote on Saturday that the OLAF report claimed Le Pen had misappropriated 140,000 euros of public money with party members in total diverting 617,000 euros. None are accused of profiting directly, but of claiming EU funds for staff and event expenses. Le Pen's office could not immediately be reached for comment. ""The French will not be fooled by attempts of the European Union and the European institutions (...) to interfere in the presidential campaign and harm Marine Le Pen,"" National Rally president Jordan Bardella told Europe 1 radio. He said his party had filed two legal complaints against OLAF, and that it would be filing a third in response to the report. Speaking to BFM TV, Le Pen's lawyer Rodolphe Bosselut said his client denied the charges. He said she had yet to be questioned and neither he nor Le Pen had seen the OLAF report. Le Pen has been under investigation since 2017 as part of a probe into the alleged misuse of European Union funds to pay parliamentary assistants.
