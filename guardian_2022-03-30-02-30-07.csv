3/30/2022,"A man accused of murdering five-year-old Logan Mwangi has a string of previous convictions including for violence and once claimed he was an ex-special forces soldier, a jury has been told. John Cole, who is on trial alongside Logan’s mother, Angharad Williamson, and a 14-year-old boy, has convictions including assault causing actual bodily harm, battery and possessing a blade in public as well as offences of dishonesty. The jury at Cardiff crown court was told the offences, which also included witness intimidation, blackmail and resisting a police officer, dated back to between 1999 and 2007. Cole, 40, Williamson, 30, and the teenager, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, deny murdering Logan, who was found in a river near his home in the village of Sarn in south Wales on 31 July last year, having suffered more than 50 injuries. The prosecution alleges all three defendants were involved in murdering Logan before concocting a cover-up that included dumping his body in the river and phoning the police to falsely report him missing. Jurors also heard on Tuesday from a man called Ethan Bevan who met Cole on the online video game Fortnite. Bevan said Cole told him he had a 99-year suspended jail sentence hanging over him. The prosecution said in fact Cole had been given no such sentence. Bevan also said that Cole had told him he was ex-special forces. Asked why he had told him he had been given the suspended jail term, Bevan said: “I didn’t know if he was trying to come across as the kind of person not to be messed with.” The trial continues with the defence expected to begin on Wednesday.

3/30/2022,"A shortage of more than 2,000 midwives means women and babies will remain at risk of unsafe care in the NHS despite an inquiry into the biggest maternity scandal in its history, health leaders have warned. A landmark review of Shrewsbury and Telford hospital NHS trust, led by the maternity expert Donna Ockenden, will publish its final findings on Wednesday with significant implications for maternity care across the UK. The inquiry, which has examined more than 1,800 cases over two decades, is expected to conclude that hundreds of babies died or were left seriously disabled because of mistakes at the NHS trust, and call for changes. But NHS and midwifery officials said they fear a growing shortage of NHS maternity staff means trusts may be unable to meet new standards set out in the report. “I am deeply worried when senior staff are saying they cannot meet the recommendations in the Ockenden review which are vital to ensuring women and babies get the safest possible maternity care,” said Gill Walton, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives (RCM). The number of midwives has fallen to 26,901, according to NHS England figures published last month, from 27,272 a year ago. The RCM says the fall in numbers adds to an existing shortage of more than 2,000 staff. Experts said the shortage is driven by the NHS struggling to attract new midwives while losing existing staff who feel overworked and fed up at being spread too thinly across maternity wards. Last week the NHS announced a £127m funding boost for maternity services aimed at improving care for mothers and babies, including £50m allocated to trusts over the next two years to increase staffing numbers in maternity and neonatal services. But Walton expressed concern that with the shortage of midwives, the recruitment and retention crisis would not be solved overnight. “We have midwives from the top down and the bottom up telling us how bad the situation is,” she said. “Obviously we welcome additional funding but there are too many questions about how it will be used to recruit and, just as importantly, retain the staff we need. The government needs to pull its head out of the sand and address this urgently.” The deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, Saffron Cordery, said hospital leaders had expressed concerns that staff shortages would hinder efforts to improve maternity services. “In our recent survey, a number of trust leaders told us that shortages across midwifery services are a major concern,” Cordery said. “It is obviously worrying that some have had to close services because of workforce gaps and we know there are fears among trust leaders that they won’t be able to recruit to the standards set out in the upcoming Ockenden report because of these gaps.” Lawyers representing families affected by the Shrewsbury maternity scandal said it was vital that recommendations made in the report are acted on as soon as possible. Tim Annett, a medical negligence lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, said: “Sadly, we continue to hear incredibly worrying first-hand accounts from families with concerns about their maternity care, not just at Shrewsbury and Telford, but other trusts. “Too often in the past we’ve seen reviews and investigations into hospital care make recommendations which have taken years to implement. This report must not be pushed to one side after publication – it’s crucial that the detail is analysed and where possible lessons are learned to improve maternity safety which must remain a focus for the NHS.”",News/Society,"Exclusive: women and babies remain at risk of unsafe NHS care, experts warn",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/29/exclusive-women-and-babies-remain-at-risk-of-unsafe-nhs-care-experts-warn
3/30/2022,"The chair of the BBC has suggested the public may overstate their appetite for impartial news, in the same way that “99% of people say they wash their hands after going to the loo”. Richard Sharp said his organisation is facing the joint challenges of stopping audiences drifting away to more partisan news outlets, while at the same time warning that the BBC’s ability to provide accurate information is under threat because of funding cuts. “Impartial news may be too unprofitable to do properly,” Sharp said at a panel event organised by the Social Market Foundation thinktank. He said the reality of what people actually click on or watch increasingly leans towards provocative and sensational content, making it harder for the BBC to judge whether its output is connecting with audiences. He said: “Around nine out of 10 adults say that impartial news is more important than coverage that reflects their point of view. But we also have to bear in mind, whether apocryphal or not, that 99% of people say they wash their hands after going to the loo.” Asked whether the corporation is able to afford the costs of meeting the expected standards of its news output, Sharp added: “It’s a real challenge, you need research capabilities and we’ve had to cut back some of the resources available. Which is why I disagree with the government on the licence fee – it’s damaging to the BBC, there’s no doubt it’ll have an effect.” Further cuts to BBC services are expected to be announced in May, with bosses currently working out what needs to be cut in the wake of the government’s latest below-inflation licence fee deal. This follows more than a decade of staff redundancies and internal reorganisations caused by repeated cuts to the fee. Sharp said he believed there was a gap in the market for the BBC’s type of journalism as commercial news organisations become increasingly polarised, although the risk is that audiences drift away to more entertaining partisan outlets such as Rupert Murdoch’s forthcoming talkTV. He cited a conversation with an unnamed individual at a British financial newspaper who said 70% of their online stories were not read by anyone. As a result he is placing faith in incoming BBC news boss Deborah Turness to “weaponise impartiality” and make it the corporation’s selling point to audiences. Her arrival has been repeatedly delayed while her current employer – arch-rival ITN – continues to make her serve out her notice period. He highlighted the success of viral explainers by the BBC’s Ros Atkins and suggested they might point towards “a commercial opportunity for the BBC globally”. He also said the corporation was impartial when it came to coverage of the war in Ukraine: “It’s about truth. Our value to Russians and Ukrainians is to report the truth, no matter how inconvenient that may be.”",News/Media,BBC chair suggests public may overstate appetite for impartial news,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/29/99-say-they-wash-their-hands-bbc-chair-questions-appetite-for-impartial-news
3/30/2022,"The Rugby Football Union has ruled that Premiership stars from South Africa and the Pacific Islands will continue to be classified as non-foreign until 2024, when the governing body is seeking to introduce beefed-up rules on England-qualified quotas, the Guardian understands. Premiership clubs are entitled to two foreign players in their matchday squads and before Brexit anyone from South Africa, Fiji, Samoa and Tonga was not considered a foreign player due to the 2003 EU Association Agreement. Clubs, however, had feared that would no longer be the case when the UK left the EU. In the wake of Brexit the RFU opted temporarily to keep the existing definitions of non-foreign players and it is understood that at the union’s most recent council meeting an extension was agreed until the end of the 2023-24 season, after which the new Professional Game Agreement comes into force. RFU guidance recently issued to clubs reads: “The decision on who can work in the UK is a matter for government. Player registration and classification rules however sit with the RFU and within the bounds of English law, it is the RFU’s decision to determine who is classified as a foreign or non-foreign player. As such due to the United Kingdom no longer being a member of the European Union, the RFU is working with stakeholders to determine the position going forwards with regards to the regulatory classification of foreign players. “From summer 2024 there will be a new EQPs system and new foreign player rules. There is further work to do to agree the detail of this subject to a new Professional Game Agreement and introduction into regulation. Pending this, an interim position will exist such that players who are or would have been classified as a non-foreign prior to 1 January 2021 will retain such non-foreign classification until the end of the 2023-24 season. This extended transitional period allows time for agents, clubs and players to plan ahead.” The RFU has previously stated that from August 2024 onwards the intention is to make it compulsory for clubs to have 15 English-qualified players (EQPs) in a matchday squad and to overhaul the foreign player rule. A statement from last year read: “The intention is to move to a position where there is a mandatory EQPs system under which Premiership clubs must have a minimum of 15 EQPs in each matchday squad and the end of the foreign player rule to provide better England player development opportunities while giving greater flexibility for Premiership clubs to select non-EQP players of any nationality.” The RFU’s stated aim of making 15 EPQs per matchday squad mandatory is an attempt to bring England closer in line with France, who have reaped the rewards of their JIFF ruling. Last week the RFU chief executive, Bill Sweeney, admitted “the English structure – everyone is fed up with it” and while he was referring more to the tug of war between club and country over England players both parties are seeking change from 2024 onwards. The Springboks director of rugby, Rassie Erasmus, recently sounded a warning over the impact that the number of South Africa players in the Premiership was potentially having on England. Writing for the Mail on Sunday, he said: “People say the English system is the envy of the world because it has all the resources. I disagree. People say South Africa are stupid for allowing our players to leave. Is it stupid? Look at England, there are six or seven South African players taking the places of young English players at Premiership clubs. For us, it’s wonderful. Is it good for England that Faf de Klerk is starting ahead of Raffi Quirke at Sale? No. Is it good for South Africa? Yes, it works for us.”",Sport/Sport,South Africans and Pacific players to keep non-foreign category until 2024,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/29/south-africans-and-pacific-players-to-keep-non-foreign-category-until-2024
3/30/2022,"The former England batter and coach Graham Thorpe has been named as the new head coach of Afghanistan’s men’s team. Thorpe, 52, was sacked as England’s assistant coach following the backroom shake-up in the wake of the disastrous 4-0 Ashes series defeat in Australia. England’s batsmen struggled desperately in Australia, failing to make 300 in a single innings, and Thorpe further attracted negative publicity for his involvement in an early-hours drinking session with players from both sides after the final Test. Police were called around 6am after the assistant coach smoked a cigar inside, the party was disbanded and somehow footage filmed by Thorpe of the incident made it into the public domain. Thorpe was the third member of the England coaching staff to lose their role, following the England team director, Ashley Giles, and the head coach, Chris Silverwood. The former head coach Lance Klusener parted company with the Afghanistan Cricket Board at the end of 2021 following two years at the helm and Thorpe, who played 100 Tests and 82 one-day internationals, will take over from Stuart Law, who had been fulfilling the head coach role on an interim basis.

3/30/2022,"A €600,000 luxury car built to withstand bullets and explosives has been seized in Sardinia as part of EU sanctions against oligarchs with close links to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. The black Mercedes-Maybach S650 Guard belongs to Alisher Usmanov, a former shareholder in Arsenal football club, and was recently seized by police in Porto Cervo on the Costa Smeralda, the Corriere della Sera reported on Tuesday. Corriere speculated that the armoured vehicle may have been used to transport Putin during “secret visits” to Sardinia, a popular destination for Russian oligarchs, especially the Porto Cervo area. Usmanov is an honorary citizen of Arzachena, the administrative hub of Porto Cervo, where the “maximum protection” car was bought in 2018, according to Corriere. The mayor of Arzachena, Roberto Ragnedda, told the Italian press early this month that Usmanov regularly hosted “heads of state, businessmen and personalities who played fundamental roles in the economy, culture, politics and property at a world level”. Usmanov is also reported to have donated €500,000 to Sardinia’s regional authorities to help fight Covid-19. The local newspaper, L’Unione Sarda, reported that other assets owned by him had also been seized on the island, including a property complex worth €17m in the Gulf of Pevero and six corporate cars. Usmanov, once said to be the UK’s richest person, last week claimed that millions of pounds of his assets were in an irrevocable trust. Other properties owned by oligarchs confiscated in Sardinia include properties worth €4m linked to Petr Aven, who until recently headed Alfa Bank, Russia’s largest commercial bank, and a property complex in Portisco, in the municipality of Olbia, owned by the billionaire businessman Alexei Mordashov. Italian police seized a yacht owned by Mordashov, the richest man in Russia before being blacklisted by the EU, and another owned by Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire with close ties to Putin, in the Ligurian port of Imperia.",News/Business,"Usmanov’s €600,000 bulletproof car seized in Sardinia as part of EU sanctions",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/29/usmanov-car-seized-sardinia-eu-sanctions-putin
3/30/2022,"While it might be true that Tony Blair was the right leader in the right circumstances to win a landslide against the Tories in 1997, essentially its success was due to the powerful undertow created by the electorate’s disgust at Tory sleaze and a belief that things should be better. It is the public mood that a party needs to assess and then recast in order to achieve cut-through and gain votes. So, when John Harris focuses on Keir Starmer’s deficiencies as an inspiring leader, he is looking at Labour’s dilemma with one eye shut (If Keir Starmer doesn’t seize the moment now, then what is his party for?, 27 March). Labour’s attempts at building a counternarrative to whatever the Tory project is will be a waste of time as voters can see it as reactive, not least in the deadening language of abstraction and euphemism. Instead, framing a viable alternative and vigorously and relentlessly pushing it forward plays to Labour’s strengths. Speaking of misery being perpetuated, and not of challenges to be met, would help. Knowledge based on genuine experience of the needs and troubles facing the working poor is being gained daily by party workers active on the ground. This can help the party develop a coherent alternative to the Tories’ bluster around levelling up and shred the grotesque image of a millionaire chancellor pretending to share people’s pain. In the end, effective cut-through works from the party out to the electorate only when the party’s base can cut through to the party’s hierarchy, not least the leader.Dr Peter ManganBeckenham, London  Despite the government’s manifest failings, Labour’s poll lead remains tenuous and Keir Starmer’s personal approval ratings lag behind those achieved in the early months of his leadership. With the next general election perhaps two years away, John Harris is right to emphasise Labour’s need to define what it stands for with clarity and urgency. Complex ideas need to be expressed succinctly to achieve resonance. There is a long history of the effective use of short phrases that capture the public mood, from the noble “liberty, equality and fraternity” to the disingenuous “take back control”, but Starmer’s mantra of “security, prosperity and respect” is neither memorable nor distinguishable from the aspirations of other parties. There is surely a role for Harris and like-minded writers who want to see the back of this government to move from analysis to a more direct form of political intervention. They should use their skills to offer pithy, apposite slogans that can compete effectively with the Tories, while emphasising Labour’s commitment to social solidarity, public services and environmental protection. As an eminent predecessor might have said, journalists have nothing to use but their brains. They have a world to win.Dr Anthony IsaacsLondon  Keir Starmer’s three abstract nouns by which he hopes to establish his “contract with the British people” fail to inspire John Harris. What about an ABC policy offer? A for acceptance of diversity, B for benefits that work, including a universal citizen’s wage, and C for constitutional reform, including proportional representation and the replacement of the Lords with a senate whose seating reflects national vote share. These policies are concrete, comprehensible and clear about what life would be like with a Labour government.

3/30/2022,"As an expert on gender and work in Devon and Somerset in the 16th and 17th centuries, I can tell you that there is nothing ridiculous or ahistorical about acknowledging female farmers and agricultural workers (Devon pub reaps Twitter storm after adding ploughperson’s to menu, 28 March). It was rare for women to plough, but we do have one example from Somerset in 1551. Women did much other farm work though, such as “clodding” the soil to break down lumps of clay, and then sowing, weeding and harvesting crops. They made hay, sheared sheep and did all the milking. Overall, we calculate that women did 32% of field work and 52% of tasks associated with animal husbandry in this period. So although “ploughman” is consistently used to symbolise small farmers and agricultural wage workers, much of the work was done by women then, as now.Prof Jane WhittleUniversity of Exeter  I applaud the “ploughperson’s lunch”, but I’d suggest the simpler term “plougher”.

3/30/2022,"On Monday evening, late-night hosts tore into by far the most talked-about moment from the Oscars: Will Smith slapping presenter Chris Rock over a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. “Even Kanye was like, ‘you went on stage and did what at an awards show?’” said Jimmy Kimmel. The “weirdest part” of the whole debacle, Kimmel said, was that “initially, Will Smith laughed” at Rock’s joke about Pinkett Smith being in GI Jane 2 – a dated movie reference seeming to nod at her shaved head. “But then he must have looked over and noticed that Jada was not amused and was like, ‘oh, I better do something.’ And boy did he do something.” “In one stunning moment the night went from #OscarsSoWhat to #OscarsSoWhaaaaat?” “No one could’ve predicted the most controversial movie of 2022 would be GI Jane, but it was,” Kimmel added. “This was the Hollywood version of your drunk uncles starting a fight, ruining the wedding, and then standing up and giving a long toast to the bride and groom.” Rock “handled this about as well as you could possibly handle being slapped on stage at the Oscars”, Kimmel, who hosted the Oscars in 2018, continued. “He didn’t even flinch when Will slapped him. I would’ve been crying so hard.” Shortly after the slap, Smith won the Oscar for best actor for his role as Richard Williams, father to Venus and Serena, in King Richard. “Assaulting Chris Rock and then winning the Oscar – it’s like storming out of the house after breaking up with your girlfriend, then coming back in because you forgot your keys,” Kimmel quipped. Smith’s tearful acceptance speech “was a weird mix of what Will planned to say and what he had to say”, Kimmel said, “and it was historic in that it was the first acceptance speech in which the winner apologized to the Academy before he thanked them. “Obviously Chris Rock did not deserve to be slapped in the face for a joke,” he concluded. “Will’s point of view was that he was defending his wife, and that’s a tough position to be in because it’s damned if you do, Ted Cruz if you don’t. And he probably wishes he had one of those Men in Black memory erasers right now.” “This is going to go down in Oscars history as one of the most chaotic moments of all time,” said Stephen Colbert of the slap heard round the world. “Let me say something here as an objective observer: it’s never OK to punch a comedian,” he facetiously added. “Will Smith was offended by the joke and wanted to stand up for his wife. Fine. Challenge Chris to a duel! Or if you really want to hurt a comedian, don’t laugh. That hurts way more than a punch, I promise you. “But this does prove one thing: Chris Rock can take a punch,” he continued, noting that Smith, whom Colbert has interviewed on the Late Show, has “a hand like a flank steak”. “If Will wanted to hit somebody he should’ve picked somebody more appropriate like Jason Momoa or Liza Minnelli – at this point, she’s clearly unkillable,” he joked. “She’s going to live forever.” In the aftermath, Rock declined to press charges, “but this is Hollywood, and there are rules”, Colbert said. “You can’t just storm a stage, physically assault someone on camera, and then go back to your seat. There have to be consequences! Like winning the Oscar for best actor and receiving a standing ovation then partying all night.” And on Late Night, Seth Meyers looked into more consequential national drama: evidence that the wife of a supreme court justice worked with Trump to try to overturn the 2020 election. Meyers referred to Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, wife of the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, who in recently revealed texts to Trump’s White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, repeatedly pushed to overturn the 2020 presidential election. “Do not concede,” she wrote. “It takes time for the army who is gathering for his back.” “Holy shit, that sounds like something Saruman would say in Lord of the Rings,” said Meyers. Even more concerning, Trump had been open about involving the supreme court, where Thomas’s husband works, in overturning the election. The Trump administration sued, unsuccessfully, to prevent the National Archives from releasing records on 6 January to Congress; the only justice to side with Trump in that 8-1 ruling was Clarence Thomas. “He sided with Trump in a case to block the release of records that could’ve potentially implicated his own wife,” Meyers said. “That is a slap in the face to the constitution. “And even if it was to protect your wife, slapping is never OK!” he added, referring to the incident at the Oscars. There’s also more evidence that the Texas senator Ted Cruz worked directly with Trump to “concoct a plan that came closer than widely realized to keeping him in power”, according to a new report by the Washington Post. “Of course Ted Cruz was involved,” said Meyers. “If there’s a rotting, insidious idea somewhere, anywhere, it’s more likely than not that Ted Cruz had a role in it.”",Arts/Culture,"Jimmy Kimmel on Will Smith: ‘Even Kanye was like, you went on stage and did what?’",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/29/jimmy-kimmel-will-smith-stephen-colbert-seth-meyers-late-night
3/30/2022,"On 31 March, heads of government will convene to pledge funds to an appeal for humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan. Your editorial (23 March) draws attention to the fact that humanitarian assistance cannot substitute for a functioning economy. The humanitarian pledging conference will almost certainly not discuss the simple measure that would enable the money donated for Afghanistan to be used effectively. Allowing the Afghan central bank to draw down modest amounts – some $150m monthly – from reserves totalling over $9bn held in US and European banks would revive the banking system and facilitate the payment of bills and salaries. It would also allow humanitarian aid to be administered effectively. That this will not even be discussed at the conference is a scandal. Governments have allowed the impression to take hold that enabling the central bank to draw on its reserves would confer legitimacy on the Taliban administration. This shows blind disregard for the suffering of millions of ordinary Afghans. If the Afghan funds in US banks have been tied up in legal knots, then those in two German banks and the Bank for International Settlements should be released under international monitoring.

3/30/2022,"Prince Andrew has prompted controversy after playing a unexpectedly prominent role escorting the Queen into a memorial service for his father, Prince Philip, in the disgraced royal’s first public appearance since settling the sexual assault case filed against him by Virginia Giuffre. The ceremony in Westminster Abbey was held to mark a year since the Duke of Edinburgh’s death after his funeral was attended by just 30 loved ones due to pandemic restrictions. It was uncertain until Tuesday morning whether the Queen would be able to attend after suffering poor mobility that has prevented her from travelling to official engagements. She travelled from Windsor with Andrew, who escorted her into Westminster Abbey, offering his elbow as she moved carefully to her place using a walking stick. Andrew’s prominent role raised eyebrows for coming so soon after a multimillion-pound out-of-court settlement in a civil sexual assault case. He continues to deny the allegation, but has stepped down from public life over his friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Former BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt said he was surprised to see the role Andrew was given at the service, noting that it would not have happened “by chance” and risked overshadowing the memorial and generating controversy around the world. “He could have sat in the congregation with others, with his relatives, but they actively decided that he would have this role of supporting her. So she has chosen, in essence, to remind people that he hasn’t admitted any wrongdoing, he’s not guilty of anything, he’s innocent. And she’s very clearly stating that he has a role at family occasions,” he said. However, Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty Magazine, said Andrew’s role might have been a matter of “practicality as much as everything”, noting that the prince had not been found guilty of anything. Andrew was given a front row seat at the proceedings, next to his brother the Earl of Wessex and across the aisle from his other siblings. Commenters on social media expressed their incredulity that Andrew had apparently recovered so quickly from the scandal, and worried about the message it might sent to survivors of domestic abuse. One tweeted: “Prince Andrew escorting Queen Elizabeth to and from her husband’s memorial service means game over. We can’t afford this government or the royal family. Not a good look.” The service was attended by some 1,800 people, with hundreds of wellwishers and passersby outside waiting to take photographs. Those who spoke to the Guardian underscored the importance of Andrew relinquishing his public duties following the scandal but felt his attendance at an important family occasion was justified. “It’s important for the whole family to be there no matter what. Harry should have come as well. A lot of people feel really sorry for the Queen watching her whole family disintegrate,” said Eve Guttentag, 72, a retired beauty therapist from London. Max Furlong, a 26-year-old heating engineer from Chingford, added: “I don’t think he should have anything to do with anything else. But you can’t say he shouldn’t have been here.” Members of the crowd had mostly come to catch a glimpse of the Queen, whom they praised for her tenacity and dedication to public service. Guttentag said she was “fabulous” and that “she’s always behaved impeccably”. Lee Styles, a 25-year-old heating engineering from Harlow, said: “It’s nice we have something like that, it’s special for British culture. We’ll never see another Queen in our lifetime probably.” Amanda Cominsky, 29, a banker from the US living in Westminster, said she had come down to “immerse myself” in UK culture. “It’s something different, something we don’t have in the US. It’s historic, traditional,” she said. Leading the service, the Dean of Windsor paid tribute to Philip’s intellect, work ethic, sense of humour and devotion to his family. The Right Rev David Conner described the duke as a “remarkable man” who was committed to “a host of down-to-earth enterprises”. He pointed out that the duke could be “abrupt”, adding that “he could be somewhat sharp in pricking what he thought to be bubbles of pomposity or sycophancy”. The Queen, the Duchess of Cornwall and the Princess Royal dressed in dark green in tribute to Philip, whose livery colour was Edinburgh Green. The service was also attended by Duke of Edinburgh award holders, one of whom, Doyin Sonibare, delivered a special tribute about the effect Philip’s youth scheme had on her life. Prof Chris Imafidon, chair of the Excellence in Education charity, was watching from outside while some of the Duke of Edinburgh award holders he works with attended the service. He said that Philip’s contribution to education was under-acknowledged. “He didn’t need to worry about children, he’s not the education minister, but he put so much effort into the next generation. He dramatically impacted lives in a way people don’t realise,” he said.",News/UK news,Prince Andrew plays prominent role in Prince Philip memorial service,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/29/prince-andrew-plays-prominent-role-in-prince-philip-memorial-service

3/30/2022,"For a little while it looked as if the impossible might happen. It was half-time in the Champions League quarter-final at Valdebebas and Barcelona were losing. Not just the first leg, but for the first time: defeat would be their first against Real Madrid, the team built to be their rivals, and the first against anyone all season. It was March and they hadn’t even drawn yet – played 34, won 34 – but Olga Carmona’s early goal had them trailing. Struggling too. This wasn’t the way it was supposed to be, Madrid more dynamic and deserving of the lead. “We weren’t happy,” Fridolina Rolfö says, “so we changed things.” Fourty-five minutes later, two from Alexia Putellas and one from Clàudia Pina completed a comeback. Barcelona had won but that wasn’t the news; the news was that they nearly hadn’t. “It was good for us to get that game,” Rolfö adds. “Hopefully we learned a lesson.” This was a new experience certainly and Wednesday will be too. The second leg is at the 99,354-seat Camp Nou. Tickets sold out in four days. They come to see perhaps the best team in the world. Barcelona are the European champions, taking Chelsea apart and winning 4-0 in the final to complete a treble last season. A fortnight ago, they won the league with six games left, their third consecutive title secured by a 5-0 victory over Madrid. They had won every game, and haven’t stopped since. Played 25, won 25. Scored 138, conceded seven. Sign up for our new women’s football newsletter In Europe, before going to Valdebebas, their results read: a 2-0, a 4-1, two 4-0s and two 5-0s. Putellas is the Ballon d’Or winner, plastered across billboards in the city. Four of her teammates were nominated. The challenge now is to keep this going. On Monday, as they prepared for the return leg, the former men’s captain Carles Puyol was at the club’s San Joan Despí training ground, invited to speak to the players. But that cuts both ways, Xavi Hernández insisting the women’s team are an “inspiration”. Sitting just down the corridor after the morning session, Rolfö smiles. “That made us very happy: I hope we can show the world how good we are,” she says. Very, very good. The Norwegian won three consecutive doubles at Wolfsburg and reached two Champions League finals but insists: “I’ve never played in such a good team.” So good it is tempting to ask whether they could replicate Lyon, who won five Champions Leagues in a row. “That’s not something we talk about but I have to say that’s possible,” she admits. “We have to be humble – there are great teams out there.” Perhaps none quite like this. “Our philosophy is special: when I talk to players about coming here, I speak in a way they have never heard before,” says the sporting director Markel Zubizarreta. Ingrid Engen, who joined from Wolfsburg in the summer, says: “It is different to other clubs; Barcelona is a reference of the way it should be.” Barcelona have won 75 of their past 78 games, yet this starts with defeat, or so the story goes. They were at the airport waiting fly home from the 2019 Champions League final, where they were defeated by Lyon, when the players approached the then coach, Lluís Cortés, and demanded to do whatever it took. In the words of the then captain, Vicky Losada, that meant “more … everything.” Unfortunate to lose the semi-final the following season, they were victorious in Gothenburg last year. It had been coming. The Barcelona Women forward Gio Queiroz on Tuesday wrote an open letter to the president, Joan Laporta, saying that she suffered ""abusive behaviour"" while at the club and that her complaint had been sent to the board of directors.  In the letter, the 18-year-old, who is on loan at Levante, claims she was ""illegally confined"" by Barcelona in February 2021 and could not travel to play for Brazil. ""I was devastated. This also meant that I couldn’t travel with the squad for the Copa de La Reina final,"" she wrote. Queiroz says she completed the quarantine and was then given permission by Fifa to join the Brazil squad in the United States. When she returned to Spain though, she claims that a meeting was in held in which she was ""unfairly accused of breaching protocol and travelling without club authorisation"". She added: “From that moment on my life changed forever. I was exposed to humiliating situations for months within the club. It was clear that he wanted to destroy my reputation, undermine my self-esteem, and degrade my working conditions.” Barcelona said on Tuesday: ""Government rules did not permit the travel with Brazil. A complaint was filed by the player to both FC Barcelona and Fifa and the investigations into both found that FC Barcelona acted properly."" Guardian sport That was the final step, symbolic of an iron determination, but the roots of this success and the commitment to women’s football run deeper, good reasons why Engen calls Barcelona a reference. It is 50 years since they played their first game, but that pioneering team were not officially linked to the club until women’s football was incorporated into the Spanish federation in 1980. Founder members of the league in 1988, officially a section of the club in 2001, they became fully professional in 2015. “In seven years, we’ve changed everything,” Zubizarreta says. “We have everything you need; everything is taken care of,” Engen says. “It’s super-professional, different to other clubs.” The budget is €4.5m (£3.8m), an important advantage at least domestically. There are signings and significant ones, particularly in attacking positions – Lieke Martens, Asisat Oshoala, Rolfö, Caroline Graham Hansen – but economics do not explain everything. It is about construction, not appropriation. Only six of the 23-strong women’s squad are foreign, and there are academy players getting opportunities. “We wanted to develop players, not just buy them.” Zubizarreta says. For the first time, there are nine girls living in the club’s La Masia residency. Eight are Catalan, one from Mallorca. The second team are professional too. Until 14, the girls’ teams play in boys’ leagues. Above all, there is an idea, an identity. And it is a familiar one, imposed through an idea for training as much as games: about a way of playing. “There is something in the DNA of the club,” Rolfö says. Zubizarreta says: “It’s not ‘women’s football’, it’s football. There is no point in playing a certain way for seven or eight years and then it’s different in the first team. If you put the television on and you can’t see if it’s men or women, you can see that it’s a Barcelona team. It is easy to stick to an idea when you’re winning; it’s harder when you’re losing.” Zubizarreta speaks from experience. The turn to professionalism brought a shift in habits, a process of adaptation that was not always easy, and it also brought doubts. Defeats, too: previously champions, from 2015-19 Barcelona were runners-up four years in a row, Atlético Madrid emerging as the dominant side. But the idea survived relatively unscathed, continuity kept. Many players remained too, reinforcing that and when Cortés left immediately after the Champions League final win, everyone burned out, the objective that obsessed them achieved, Zubizarreta says he must have received “a hundred coaches’ CVs”. The decision to instead promote Jonatan Giráldez was, he says, “obvious”. “We have players who have been here for many, many years, who have grown up with this style, so to have them in the team is super-important,” Engen says. “Alexia, Patri, Aitana: you see how they understand each other. You get international players in to give you something else: maybe more physicality or speed. But this is the Barcelona style and that’s what I’m trying to learn.” In her case, she explains, that means adapting to the No 6 role, a positional game, “learning to stand still. Not to pass and go, but to stay sometimes.” She adds: “At Barcelona it is not enough to win – it is how you play and that’s in the roots of this team.” And win they do, relentlessly. The surprise may be that there is no relaxation, no falling away: when every week brings a huge score, some decompression might be inevitable; when you walk the league there is a risk of walking, full stop. But this is a hard, tough team, Rolfö says, “a group of really competitive players. The coach sets small short-term goals: it’s not about winning a game, it’s [that] we have to play good. You have to do this, this, this. So, you’re putting pressure on. That’s helped us to be focused 90 minutes, every game. If you drop in the league you won’t win in the Champions League.” “It’s not an option to not go and compete every game,” Engen says. “It is the mentality: we talk about it in the dressing room. We’re not happy to stop doing our best. That’s also why we have the results we have, with so many goals. We want more every time. And we don’t change anything. If we lead a lot it is not like someone does something on their own because they can. We are not happy at the break if we’re leading 3-0.” So imagine how they feel if they’re actually losing 1-0.",Sport/Football,‘Different to other clubs’: how Barcelona Women left rivals behind,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/29/how-barcelona-women-left-rivals-behind-sold-out-camp-nou
3/30/2022,"A rare white-tailed eagle found dead in Dorset was poisoned, police have confirmed – but they have shut the case, in a decision the RSPB has called “baffling”. The eagle was one reintroduced on the Isle of Wight, where a successful programme has been taking place since summer 2019. The white-tailed eagles had become extinct in the UK in the early 20th century after they were poisoned and shot by gamekeepers. Those who run shoots are often opposed to birds of prey being in the area, as when they fly over a shoot, the birds scatter. They also occasionally predate on game birds. The eagle was found dead on an unnamed estate in Dorset in January, and police launched an investigation into its death. Many conservationists in the area suspected it had been poisoned. The toxicology results have confirmed the eagle had high levels of brodifacoum, a rodenticide, in its system. But police have closed the investigation and will not be naming the estate on which the dead eagle was found. A spokesperson for Dorset police said: “An investigation under section 1 of the Wildlife Countryside Act 1981 was carried out in conjunction with the RSPB, Natural England, National Wildlife Crime Unit and the Roy Dennis Wildlife Foundation. A detailed examination and tests have been carried out on the bird, which were inconclusive, and it has therefore not been possible to confirm that any criminal offence has been committed. “While high levels of brodifacoum were detected, it has not been possible to establish whether this was as a result of a deliberate act or due to secondary rodenticide poisoning. As a result, no further police action will be taken in relation to this report.” The local MP, Chris Loder, a Conservative, was opposed to the police investigation, arguing that looking into the death of an eagle was a waste of funds. He also said that white-tailed eagles were not welcome in Dorset. An RSPB spokesperson said: “We are completely baffled by the decision of Dorset police to end the white-tailed eagle investigation so prematurely. “Brodifacoum – the rodent poison that killed the eagle – is highly toxic and it is clear that it was either used incompetently or with intent to kill the eagle – either way an illegal act.”",News/Environment,"Dead eagle found in Dorset was poisoned but case closed, police confirm ",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/29/dead-eagle-found-in-dorset-was-poisoned-but-case-closed-police-confirm
3/30/2022,"Australians and fans around the world will have their chance to farewell Shane Warne at a star-studded memorial at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Wednesday evening. Warne was farewelled by close friends and family at a private funeral on 20 March, after he suffered a heart attack while on holiday in Thailand, aged 52. Now the general public has their chance to pay tribute to the beloved sporting icon. A last-minute round of extra tickets was released for the event on Tuesday. The state memorial service is being held on Wednesday evening in Melbourne. The gates of the MCG will open about 5:30pm for a 7pm start, with the event running for two hours. Television personality Eddie McGuire, whose production company has organised the event, said that as well as family and close friends honouring Warne there would be a mix of performances by celebrities in Australia and abroad. Celebrities including Russell Crowe, Hugh Jackman, James Packer, Eric Bana, Greg Norman, and Kelly Slater will all pay tribute to Warne. A number of international stars will perform remotely, either live or taped. “Elton John, Chris Martin, Robbie Williams, and Ed Sheeran will be singing dedicated songs to Shane Warne in his memory and for this particular night,” McGuire said. Kylie and Danni Minogue will both be there, but it is unclear if they will perform. Jon Stevens is set to front a band playing a medley of Warne’s favourite INXS and Noiseworks songs while Anthony Callea will also sing. Cricket greats Nasser Hussain, Wasim Akram and Brian Lara are flying into Melbourne for the memorial, held at the venue where Warne captured his 700th Test wicket against Ashes foe England. Warne’s three children, his father, Keith, and brother Jason will also speak, while the Shane Warne Stand, formerly known as the Great Southern Stand, will be unveiled. McGuire, who will act as master of ceremonies, has said both Warne’s ex-fiancee Liz Hurley and his ex-wife and the mother of his children, Simone Callahan, would be “part of the show” but not in attendance. More than 50,000 people are have already nabbed tickets to the event, which are free. Another 10,00 spots were released on Tuesday morning after the stage had finished being erected. Warne’s family have asked that fans wear their cricket gear if they can to help memorialise him. McGuire said the two-hour event would be “quite spectacular”. “We’d like to invite people to come because this is going to be just one of the greatest events in the history of the city, in this country, in many ways – a tribute to a champion.” Tickets are free and are still available through Ticketek. All the free-to-air TV channels will be broadcasting the service. Guardian Australia will also be covering the event with a live blog, beginning just before the service kicks off at 7 pm. The Victorian government website will also be streaming the event. Australia’s other major cricket grounds, including the Sydney Cricket Ground, Gabba, Adelaide Oval and Perth’s Optus Stadium, will all be broadcasting the service. The broadcast at the SCG is not ticketed and gates open at 6:45 pm. In Brisbane at the Gabba, guests are asked to register their attendance before arrival and gates open at 6pm (local time.) The Adelaide Oval event is only open to SACA Members and their guests and in Perth, the public is invited, but are asked to book a free ticket, through Ticketmaster. -With Australian Associated Press",Sport/Sport,"Shane Warne memorial service: how to get tickets, events outside Melbourne, how to watch on TV",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/30/shane-warne-memorial-service-how-to-get-tickets-mcg-time-events-outside-melbourne-scg-gabba-how-to-watch-at-home-on-tv
3/30/2022,"A Victorian crossbench MP is set to introduce a motion to parliament next week calling on the government to overhaul the state’s “weak” donation laws. It comes after the Centre for Public Integrity last week urged the government to strengthen rules around political donations, election advertising and lobbying ahead of the November poll. Sustainable Australia MP Clifford Hayes says there are still many “loopholes” that political parties routinely exploit. This is despite changes to the state’s donation laws in 2018, which require donations above $1,050 to be disclosed and capped at $4,210 over four years. “Party fundraisers, corporate sponsorship of business forums, annual levies and membership fees aren’t covered by the reforms,” Hayes said. “There’s also the backdoor way, where you can give to the federal party and because the donation laws are so weak federally that money is funnelled to the state.” Hayes’s motion, to be introduced when parliament resumes on 5 April, calls on the government to broaden the definition of “donation” to include such income streams. It also says “weak donation laws undermine the public’s trust in Victoria’s political and bureaucratic processes”, and describes donations from sectors who rely on the issuing of government permits as particularly “problematic”. Hayes said the motion will help to rebuild trust in public institutions after the pandemic. “I’m very concerned about public mistrust in politics. There is a feeling that the major parties have sold out to corporate interests and I believe political donations is a huge factor in that,” he said. “The only way you can stop that, or fight against that belief, is to bring in tight laws to stamp it out. We can’t let it get to the extent where the public lose faith in political decisions and I think it’s getting to that stage.” Last week, the Centre for Public Integrity said attendance fees for fundraising events should be captured by the definition of donation, as it is in New South Wales. Catherine Williams, research director at the Centre for Public Integrity, said last week there were times those fees were higher than the cost of organising an event. “For instance, there may be a dinner where an MP is the headline act and it costs thousands of dollars to attend, but we know that running that dinner doesn’t cost thousands of dollars,” Williams said. “The difference between the cost of running the event and the fee needs to be explicitly captured as a donation. That’s how they do it in New South Wales.” Hayes said it was problematic developers pay thousands of dollars to attend events with the planning minister with little oversight. “They claim it has no influence, but surely if someone pays a huge amount of money to the party to talk to you about something they’re not doing it for the good company or the good food. They’re expecting something in return,” he said. In February 2020, Hayes’s motion urging the government to ban property developer donations to political parties, MPs and local councillors was opposed by both Labor and the Coalition.",News/Australia news,Bid to overhaul Victoria’s political donation laws to target ‘backdoor’ funding and ‘loopholes’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/30/bid-to-overhaul-victorias-political-donation-laws-to-target-backdoor-funding-and-loopholes
3/30/2022,"The usefulness of interventions and upgrades proposed to the Newcastle to Sydney rail line has been questioned by infrastructure experts, noting plans from both the Coalition and Labor lack detail and realistic long-term vision. As part of the budget, the federal government has pledged $1bn – to be matched by state government investment – to build 10km of new electrified tracks along the route, along with new rail bridges and stations between south Tuggerah and Wyong. The government argued the improvements would allow for additional express services to bypass the slower main track and set the corridor up for faster trains and improve reliability of passenger and freight services. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the infrastructure investments “will get people home sooner and safer” but federal urban infrastructure minister, Paul Fletcher, told ABC Radio the amount of time that would be saved was incalculable at this stage. The upgrade announcement was part of the coalition’s $17.9b pre-election infrastructure cash splash. The government commitment came after opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, in January pledged a Labor government would develop a plan to deliver high speed rail between Melbourne and Brisbane. Albanese announced an initial $500m would go towards land acquisition for the Newcastle to Sydney corridor, claiming travel times would be slashed from over two hours to 45 minutes. Grattan Institute transport and cities director, Marion Terrill, said the Labor plan was “very vague” and she couldn’t see how the Coalition’s intervention would significantly improve travel times to the point of usefulness for daily commuters. “The trip from newcastle to Sydney is really slow. There is very difficult geography. It might shift the 160 minutes to 120 minutes with faster rail,” Terrill said. “You’re not really talking daily commuters, so then who uses train if not for commuting? It’s leisure passengers. People having access to the capital is important but it’s a lot of money for that.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Committee for Sydney chief executive, Gabriel Metcalf, – who has been calling on the federal and state governments to work together to improve the line – welcomed the unusual “bipartisan consensus”. But he said there should be more detail from the state government on what it sees as a the long-term plan for the line. “Corridor acquisition and incremental bits of investment along the way are fine, you’ve got to start somewhere, but we don’t know what the alignment is going to be,” Metcalf said. “Let’s take it seriously enough to actually get it done, which means approving a plan and then moving through all the subsequent stages. “The best news is that we have a bipartisan consensus that this project needs to happen.” Head of University of Sydney’s school of project management, Prof Jennifer Whyte, said the coalition’s “relatively small intervention” could make a difference to travel times, but that more needed to explained about how it fitted in with the broader infrastructure plans for the state. “Too often we think about a project as an island whereas it is an intervention into an existing system,” she said. “It’s not a bad idea to do upgrades to the existing track because the cost of the overall project is so great. To find the bits which are really the bottlenecks in the network is not a bad solution.” Whyte expressed possible concern over the cost for such a short piece of track, noting the lack of publicly available information made it hard to assess the usefulness of the project.",News/Australia news,‘Very vague’: infrastructure experts question pre-election rail promises for NSW,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/30/very-vague-infrastructure-experts-question-pre-election-rail-promises-for-nsw
3/30/2022,"The suspension of Kiama MP Gareth Ward from the New South Wales parliament has jeopardised a bill based on a landmark inquiry that found the removal of Aboriginal children from their families was escalating “at an alarming rate” in the state. The Family Is Culture bill would for the first time require magistrates to “presume” an inherent harm in removing Aboriginal children from their families, in what advocates have hailed as a landmark reform to NSW’s scandal-plagued out-of-home-care system. Drafted by Greens MP David Shoebridge, the bill would codify changes recommended by Prof Megan Davis in a 2019 report detailing serious shortcomings in the system. After it sailed through the upper house with cross-party support last month – despite vocal opposition from the government – the bill was due to be introduced into the lower house on Wednesday. However the Guardian can reveal the legislation is now likely to be delayed after the suspension of Ward from parliament until charges against him are resolved, and as the government continues to lobby MPs against the bill. Ward was suspended from parliament after being charged by the NSW police over allegations of sexual assault against a man and a 17-year-old boy. He has denied the allegations and indicated he will be fighting the charges. Ward was minister for families when the Family is Culture report was handed to the NSW government in 2019. At the time, he said that its hundreds of recommendations would be “considered carefully and in their entirety”. But three years later, progress on key reforms recommended in the report have stalled and Davis has labelled the government’s response “incredibly disappointing”. Ward moved to the crossbench in 2021. Despite supporting the government on dozens of bills and motions since leaving the Coalition party room, the Guardian understands that he was seriously contemplating supporting the bill when it came to the lower house, due to his own frustrations with the slow progress on the reforms. That support could have proved crucial. Dominic Perrottet’s government is deep in minority, and the bill is being co-sponsored by three key lower-house independents and the Shooters MP Roy Butler. One of those independents, Lake Macquarie MP Greg Piper, has carriage of the bill in the lower house. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Ward’s suspension means the bill’s supporters are concerned they do not yet have the numbers needed to pass the legislation, and are unlikely to bring it forward this week as negotiations continue with members of both the crossbench and the government. The bill’s progress has also been complicated by the Coalitions’s own lobbying. Until recently the government had refused to consider any recommendations from Davis’s report which required legislative changes until 2024. But speaking to the Guardian this month the minister for families and communities, Natasha Maclaren-Jones, revealed she had ordered the department to begin work on some of the reforms. The Guardian understands that since then, the government has been lobbying against the Shoebridge bill, and has circulated a briefing that outlines plans to bring its own legislation to the house by October this year after more consultation. “The Department of Communities and Justice is now consulting with Aboriginal groups, the courts and legal stakeholders on which FIC recommendations can be implemented quickly and which recommendations need more consideration,” the briefing states. However any government legislation is unlikely to address concerns among the legal and Indigenous groups who have supported the Shoebridge bill. The government’s briefing includes criticisms of plans to increase the length of time that an Aboriginal child must be in out-of-home care before permanency orders can be made, as well as a requirement for Aboriginal-controlled organisations to approve those orders. Both of those reforms are among the key demands of Indigenous groups in the sector including the Aboriginal Legal Service and AbSec. The Greens responded with their own briefing pointing out the bill is the result of long-running consultation, and is an attempt to codify the government’s own report. Davis’s report called for sweeping reforms to the child protection system, finding disproportionate removals of Aboriginal children from their families was often the result of systemic failures. Davis found that in some cases children “not at risk of harm were removed from their families” by department caseworkers who “regularly” provided “false or misleading” evidence to the children’s court. Shoebridge’s bill seeks to force the government to fast-track those changes, including the requirement for magistrates to consider a presumption of harm when ordering the removal of an Aboriginal child from their family. Chief executive of the NSW Aboriginal Legal Service and palawa woman, Karly Warner, has called on MPs to “show that they care about Aboriginal children, care about closing the gap, and value the voices of Aboriginal experts” by supporting the bill. “The NSW government has signed on to the Closing the Gap target of reducing over-representation of Aboriginal children in out-of-home care,” she said. “The reforms in this bill are an evidence-based path to achieving that goal, backed by an independent expert review and supported by Aboriginal organisations. Voting for the Family is Culture bill makes sense, but more importantly, it’s the right thing to do. Our kids deserve no less.”",News/Australia news,Bid to reform NSW’s out-of-home-care system in peril after suspension of MP Gareth Ward,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/30/bid-to-reform-nsws-out-of-home-care-system-in-peril-after-suspension-of-mp-gareth-ward
3/30/2022,"Brisbane religious school Citipointe Christian college restricted its school counsellors from providing any support to students on matters of sexuality or gender identity last month, amid uproar about new “discriminatory” enrolment contracts. The school’s principal, Brian Mulheran, took extended leave in February after asking families to sign an enrolment contract that said students could only be enrolled by their “biological sex”. The contract included a “statement of faith” that described homosexual acts as “immoral” and “offensive to God”. Mulheran ultimately withdrew the contracts and apologised to students, saying: “The college does not and will not discriminate against any student because of their sexuality or gender identity.” Guardian Australia has now obtained an extract of a letter Mulheran sent to teachers before the contracts were revoked, when the school was experiencing considerable public backlash, in which he explained his reasons for their creation. In the extract, Mulheran said the enrolment contracts introduce a “major material change” that mean the school would only enrol students in accordance with their biological sex. “It truly breaks by heart to include such a clause,” Mulheran said. “Recent changes to our state legislation now make it impossible for us to accommodate precious young lives with gender dysphoria or gender incongruence if they desired to progress further towards transitioning. “State legislation has restricted our ability to journey alongside such young people in a way we believe would help and support their families best. These precious young people with such dispositions need to be afforded love, care and support, and I believe we would be one of the best schools to support them.” Mulheran also detailed plans to withdraw in-school psychological support to children who sought counselling for gender and sexuality issues. He said students who desired counselling would be given a referral to go elsewhere. “The second major change relates to restrictions on our student counsellors and psychologists regarding the support they can provide our students,” he said. “Our student counsellors and psychologists will not be able to counsel or provide support in areas including but not limited to: gender dysphoria, gender incongruence, gender identity, sexuality and sexual orientation. Students who desire to seek counselling for these areas will be referred to experts outside the college. “Our counsellors and psychologists must be available for all students and therefore will be limited from dealing with such complex issues.” Mulheran did not specify which changes to state legislation prompted the school’s revised approach. Guardian Australia has only been able to identify one potentially relevant change to legislation in recent years – a statewide ban on gender and conversion therapies, passed in 2020. Multiple former teachers and students say that such conversion therapies have previously occurred at the school. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Guardian Australia reported last week that Citipointe had sent teachers employment contracts that threatened them with the sack for being openly gay. The school says these are being redrawn and that its parent body, the International Network of Churches, has withdrawn its controversial “statement of faith”. Guardian Australia has sought clarification from the school about several matters, including whether the restriction on counselling on gender and sexuality matters was revoked once Mulheran took extended leave. The school sent a brief reply that did not address that question. It said: “The college has provided and will continue to provide pastoral care and support to all students, and values all students equally.” “Citipointe Christian college can confirm that the new enrolment contract has been withdrawn in February 2022 and will not be reintroduced.” The school did not address questions about whether the school had ever authorised or undertaken any sort of conversion therapy on students.",News/Australia news,Citipointe Christian college principal blamed state government for school’s policy on transgender children,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/30/citipointe-christian-college-principal-blamed-state-government-for-schools-policy-on-transgender-children

Over the next fortnight, the Perth-born comedian is going back to her roots with a new show, titled Tea, which she will perform as part of the Melbourne international comedy festival. It is her fondness for theatre – and the accompanying costumes – that prompts her to name a sewing machine as her most helpful possession. Here, Hooper tells us about that sturdy appliance, as well as the story of two other personal belongings. You start thinking about this and quickly realise your answer is “everything, please”. I like my things, which is why I haven’t already burned them in a fire.

If not, I’d request that you break the news to her that we’re leaving two in the fire. I wish sewing machines had odometers; I’d love to know how many kilometres mine has done.

Since then I’ve costumed dozens of theatre shows, sewn countless questionable outfits for myself from vintage patterns, made a tuxedo for a ball date, a dress for a boyfriend experimenting in drag, and jackets for my dog. I even met my husband because of a sewing project, when I did a late-night fitting on a mutual friend for a dance unitard. It was designed to resemble a 70s Kingswood, and Wade struck up a conversation as I measured up his friend for the brown and cream Lycra monstrosity. The rest is history. Since the pandemic I’ve made 100 fabric masks for friends and family. And yes, I’m one of those parents who takes Book Week too seriously. My proudest recent project was a “Christmas ice fairy” dress for my kid. It was a present she wore nonstop for a week, and boasted “Mum made this” to anyone who’d listen. I love praise. Back in about 2010, I lived in the last terrace house in North Melbourne to have a front window with no security bars. One day I came back from a 20-minute errand to find the window smashed and my bedside drawer emptied. I think someone had watched me leave. I still miss what was taken: a gold bracelet that held charms I’d collected from my mother for my teenage milestones – a dance award, my 16th birthday, a science prize. I made a list of what was hanging on it, hoping that one day I’d be able to afford to buy another bracelet and replace every charm. But – here’s the fun bit – I lost that list. I miss the charm bracelet. I regret losing the list. There’s a bright side to the story though. I thought I’d also lost two sweet little rings that I took from my grandmother when she passed, but a few days later I discovered I’d left them in an odd place in my office. I’ve never been so delighted to be absent-minded. Losing things is inevitable. But better to lose things while using them than by leaving them in your bedroom drawer.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Three things with Claire Hooper: ‘Yes, I’m one of those parents who takes Book Week too seriously’",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/30/three-things-with-claire-hooper-yes-im-one-of-those-parents-who-takes-book-week-too-seriously
3/30/2022,"Netflix has announced the return of Iron Chef to our streaming screens later this year and, as a superfan of the godfather of blockbuster cooking shows, I’m excited. The original series, Ryōri no Tetsujin (literally “Ironmen of Cooking”), aired in Japan for nearly 300 episodes across seven seasons between 1993 and 1999. It was one of the first Japanese series to be broadcast globally and became a cult classic notable for its flamboyant dubbing and uniquely absurd premise. A mysterious and weathly aristocrat named Chairman Kaga (played by well-known Japanese actor Kaga Takeshi) is searching for the next Rosanjin (legendary Japanese gourmet and aesthete, Kitaōji Rosanjin). In his quest he constructs Kitchen Stadium, where challengers pit their culinary skills against one of a team of Kaga’s hand-selected experts in different global cuisines, known as the Iron Chefs. From the elaborate costumes to the rousing Hans Zimmer orchestral theme music (actually a track lifted from the soundtrack to the 1991 Hollywood film Backdraft), every episode had a sense of occasion. It was Friday Night Football, without the ball. However ridiculous Iron Chef may have seemed, its influence on cooking programming has been genre-defining. It was perhaps the first instance of competitive cooking on television, rather than instructional and domestic shows. Now competitive cooking is one of the most ubiquitous and successful reality TV formats the world over. In Japan, sports commentary is an artform and Iron Chef celebrated it with play-by-play caller Fukui Kenji and colour commentator Hattori Yukio narrating the action of Kitchen Stadium (previous viewers will also remember the excited interjections of “Fukui-san!” from kitchen reporter Ota Shinichiro). This facilitated another of Iron Chef’s great strengths: diversity. It was the first program to show chefs proficient in different cuisines on screen at the same time, and the commentary of Fukui and Hattori’s commentary were integral to explaining dishes, ingredients and techniques that most of the audience had never seen before. When legendary French chef Joël Robuchon appeared on the show as a guest judge for a truffle-themed “battle”, he noted, “With one theme ingredient you have a matchup of totally different cuisines – French and Japanese. This is very impressive and interesting. I’ve never seen a program quite like this.” Neither had most of us. Chefs cooking dishes as entertainment was something completely new. These were dishes we were never meant to recreate. There were no instructions given or asked for. This was cooking purely as sport. Purely as art. As a teenager watching it, I was spellbound. If Robuchon had never seen television like this before, I’d never seen cooking like this before. And it’s stuck with me ever since. Decades on, my own show The Cook Up still gives a nod to Iron Chef in its theatrical theme reveals, complete with cloche reveal and camera zoom. Keen-eyed viewers might also notice that whenever I cook a recipe that includes capsicum, I walk on to screen holding the capsicum in my hand. It’s my way of acknowledging what I think is one of the most important pieces of visual storytelling in food TV, and one that played at the start of every episode of Iron Chef: a shot of Chairman Kaga standing in the centre of Kitchen Stadium, surrounded by a legion of white-toqued chefs, before Kaga bites into a yellow capsicum with gusto and a barely-stifled laugh as the camera pulls away. They could have shot that again without the laugh (no doubt they did), but keeping it was brilliance. That laugh tells you all you need to know about the show, and to me it’s the reason why none of Iron Chef’s many imitators since have ever superseded it. Some, like Top Chef and MasterChef, made competitive cooking earnest. Others, like Nailed it! and Worst Cooks, lean into the inherent absurdity of their premise. Iron Chef did both. It earnestly delivered brilliant chefs, creativity and incredible food, while acknowledging that the very idea of chefs competing was all a bit ridiculous. Kaga’s little laugh showed that, no matter absurd and over the top it got, Iron Chef was always, always in on the joke. Iron Chef is available to watch on SBS On Demand.

3/30/2022,"“Behind those gates, that was our private home … that was his sacred place,” says Priscilla Presley of the Memphis mansion that has earned the status of the US’s second most visited historical home after the White House. “There we could shut ourselves out from the world.” Nevertheless, some 600,000 Elvis fans walk through the home’s distinctive music manuscript-decorated wrought iron gates every year, turning Graceland over the past four decades into one of America’s top tourist destinations. And this month part of the museum’s 1.5 million-strong collection of artefacts and memorabilia is in Australia, in something of a coup for Victoria’s regional Bendigo Art Gallery: the result of more than two years of negotiation during the Covid-19 lockdown by gallery director Jessica Brigfoot, curator Lauren Ellis, Elvis Presley Enterprises’s vice-president of archives and exhibits, Angie Marchese, and Priscilla Presley herself. Some 300 items are on display – from the mundanities of childhood (a box of crayons with Elvis’s first name scrawled on the carton in red) to the trophies of early Hollywood fame (such as the red MG 1600 MKI he owned, which featured in the 1960 film Blue Hawaii). It culminates in the celebrity excess of the Las Vegas costume room, featuring a dozen glittering 1970s jumpsuits designed by long-time Presley style collaborator Bill Belew. Visiting Bendigo earlier this month, on the weekend of the exhibition’s opening, the outsider gets the impression the entire city has caught Elvis mania. Every second cafe, clothing retailer and hairdresser seems to have festooned their window displays with Presley iconography, as businesses pump out into the city’s main streets the classics All Shook Up, Blue Suede Shoes and Love Me Tender. At popular brunch spot Percy and Percy they’re serving up sophisticated versions of Presley’s infamous banana, bacon and peanut butter burger combo; the Bluebird bakery is churning out blue suede choux eclairs; and the Dispensary in Bendigo’s trendy Chancery Lane is perfecting its bacon, maple syrup and tequila margarita. Every Friday and Saturday nights for the duration of the Presley exhibition, concluding on 17 July, Bendigo Tramways’ Shake Rattle n Roll express, with a mobile cocktail bar, will ferry tourists through the city’s gold rush-built city streets accompanied by a high-decibel Elvis soundtrack. A two-metre high, brightly lit “Viva Bendigo” sign stands at the entry of the city’s central Rosalind Park. In comparison, the arrival of an impossibly preserved 76-year-old Priscilla to open the exhibition seemed positively understated. The exhibition has been carefully curated to reflect an unexpected depth and complexity to the pop culture icon. At a media Q&A the day before the opening, Priscilla teared up while talking about the aspects of Elvis’s life and personality that did not feed comfortably into the King’s celebrity narrative. While his love of fast cars, motorbikes, horses, over-the-top fashion and other women are well-documented, Elvis’s ongoing exploration into religion and spirituality is less so, as is his lifelong love of books. He often read through the night, adding copious notes to the margins as he went. “We could come home at two o’clock in the morning or later, and he would go right to the books and start reading,” Priscilla says. “And he would read [out loud to me] and I would be so tired … and he would say, ‘you aren’t listening to me’ and I would say [to myself], ‘OK, keep your eyes open’.” There were so many books stacked up around their palatial bed that she commissioned a cabinet maker to construct pull-out bookcases under it, out of concern her husband would injure himself in the dark. Some of those books are part of the Bendigo exhibition, including one of his most cherished: a heavily notated copy of Kahlil Gibran’s The Prophet. Presley’s eccentric nocturnal lifestyle – in part fuelled by a lifelong reliance on barbiturates and sleeping pills – impacted Priscilla from the earliest stages of their relationship. When she first arrived at Graceland, one of Elvis’s favourite dates was late-night private screenings of new release films at the local cinema, with the assistance of a devoted long-serving projectionist. “We would leave [Graceland] right after the Johnny Carson monologue and we would head out for the theatre, sometimes coming home at three, four or five o’clock in the morning. At that time I was going to school by the way, so I would go to bed and then get up at 7.30 … I didn’t do well with the grades.” It is the only reference Priscilla makes the most problematic aspects of their love story: that she was a 14-year-old schoolgirl when they met in Germany in 1959. Ten years her senior, he was the world’s wealthiest and most famous sergeant undertaking his compulsory military service in Bad Nauheim, where her stepfather and her family were stationed. While still a teenager, and with no sign of the long-distance romance dwindling, Priscilla’s parents agreed on her returning to the states to take up residence in Memphis in early 1963, under the conditions she finish her education at a local all-girls Catholic school, that she resided in a nearby residence to Graceland chaperoned by Presley’s father, Verne, and his second wife, and that a contract of eventual marriage be honoured. In her autobiography, Elvis and Me, Priscilla admits that soon after arriving in Memphis, she spent most of her time at Graceland, but insists the relationship was never fully consummated until the couple married in 1967, when she was 21 years old. Biographers and journalists who have suggested otherwise have not fared well in courts of law. It was a relatively low-key Las Vegas wedding. Priscilla shopped for her off-the-rack high-neck ivory wedding dress in the company of long-term “Memphis mafia” member Charlie Hodge, who posed as her fiance (the “Memphis mafia” was the nickname of Presley’s entourage, made up of close family, band musicians and long-term school friends, many of whom also resided at Graceland). Elvis Presley’s black brocade tuxedo was smuggled from the costume crate for Clambake, the movie he was working on at the time. The couple’s only child, Lisa Marie, was born nine months later. The tuxedo, along with Priscilla’s heavily beaded but modest gown, are part of the Bendigo exhibition, along with her veil and tiara. “The beginning [of the marriage] was very difficult, but I knew what I was in for because I saw it at a very young age,” she says in Bendigo. The gossip was the hardest part. “That’s when I started not reading papers anymore or [magazines] in the grocery stores,” she says. “I found out how vicious people could be … there were rumours I was pregnant, and that’s why he got married and I’m going, ‘Oh my God, this is not gonna be good for me’. “So it was hard to get accepted. But he always told me, ‘Don’t pay attention … don’t even listen and don’t look at the tabloids. You know what the truth is so just be cautious, but be aware’.” The marriage lasted six years. At age 27, Priscilla was all grown up, and confesses to two brief extra-marital affairs out of a feeling of physical rejection (in her autobiography she writes that when she was a teenager, Presley said he would never be sexually attracted to a woman who had given birth). She wanted to explore her own interests, opinions and ambitions without the controlling influence of a charismatic and world famous sex symbol. The couple left the divorce court hand in hand and neither ever remarried. Priscilla says she had regular long late night phone calls with her troubled ex-husband up until a matter of days before his death at Graceland in 1977, at the age of 42. Then the money troubles started. “Elvis was the type of guy that if you wanted something, you just buy it; you can buy two cars or a house in one day and give ‘em away, that was just Elvis,” says Angie Marchese, who has been keeper of the Presley archives since 2017 and accompanied Priscilla to Bendigo. “If he needed money, he’d just go on tour. But then Elvis passes, and there’s no more money coming in anymore.” The estate was run by Elvis’s father, Vernon, until he died in 1979, leaving the mansion, grounds, artefacts and bills to Priscilla. “That’s where it became apparent that there was not enough money to keep things running,” Marchese says. Turning Graceland – a private safe haven – into a money-making enterprise was “scary” for Priscilla. “Opening it up for the world to see was quite a brave thing for her to do,” Marchese says. And they never expected it would have been opened for as long as it has. “[It was assumed that] after five years, everyone who wanted to see Graceland [would] have seen Graceland, but by then the money will have built up and Graceland will have been saved.” Priscilla admits to a gut-wrenching dilemma over protecting the privacy of the Presley lifestyle and the instinct to preserve the Elvis legacy. Notwithstanding financial urgency, the latter won out. “Elvis never thought that he would be remembered, that was his thing,” Priscilla says. “He said, ‘you know, once I pass nobody will remember me’ and that really stuck with me … [throughout his fame] he was always asking, ‘How long will this last?’” The obsession with returning to the obscurity of his poverty-ridden childhood years plagued both Elvis and Vernon, who devoted himself to the exhaustive preservation of his son’s archives. Priscilla is moved by the curation of the Bendigo exhibition, which brings this essential neurosis to the fore. She said she got “a bit angry” recently when reading a book that claimed Elvis’s Las Vegas jumpsuits were a reference to Liberace. “This person didn’t know Elvis Presley and why he had those suits,” she says. “He wanted the audience to get a sight and go home with something to talk about. It wasn’t about Liberace. That didn’t impress Elvis at all. “It was always about the audience.” Elvis: Direct from Graceland is open at Bendigo Art Gallery until 17 July 2022",Arts/Culture,Priscilla Presley brings Graceland to Bendigo: ‘Elvis never thought that he would be remembered’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/30/priscilla-presley-brings-graceland-to-bendigo-elvis-never-thought-that-he-would-be-remembered
3/30/2022,"The Palaszczuk government’s attempt to extend Covid-19 emergency powers by another six months has been met with fierce opposition from parties across the political divide. The Greens and Liberal National Party have both called for greater transparency and oversight over the state’s pandemic legislation, in rare agreement. Labor has proposed to extend the powers of the chief health officer to issue detention orders and public health directions imposing mandatory quarantine, social distancing and movement restrictions. The government’s numbers in parliament mean the bill is likely to be pushed through in its current form, extending the legislation until the end of October. But the LNP has called for the government to be given until 31 May to map out future restrictions, as well as the establishment of a bi-partisan committee to overseeing the extension of powers. It has also called for health advice informing the decision to be released to the public. The Greens will also put forward a series of amendments this week requesting health advice be made public, the ability for public health directions to be disallowed by parliament and an assessment of human rights implications to be provided. Shadow health minister, Ros Bates, described the provisions contained in the bill as “extraordinary” during the second reading of the bill on Tuesday, and said they give unprecedented power to the government, with “little or no oversight.” “It is time for us to look to the future,” Bates said. “It is now the responsibility of the government to provide a step-by-step roadmap, grounded in expert advice that shows Queenslanders the path out of this pandemic.” Greens MPs Amy MacMahon and Michael Berkman said they would abstain from voting on the bill if amendments were not passed to make it “accountable, transparent and in line with Queensland human rights law.” “The Human Rights Commission doesn’t support the extension of emergency powers, so neither can the Queensland Greens,” MacMahon said. “A robust pandemic response relies on the trust of everyday people – a transparent and accountable government is needed to maintain that trust.” Earlier this month, Queensland Human Rights Commissioner, Scott McDougall, recommended the government replace the temporary measures with “fit-for-purpose, pandemic legislation” that are “transparent, accountable and more compatible with human rights”. He said the government should “follow the lead” of Victoria and the ACT on the legislation and allow for parliamentary oversight of the decision to grant emergency powers. Meanwhile, Katter’s Australian Party will take its opposition to the government’s Covid restrictions one step further this week by requesting the Public Health Act 2005 be changed to remove the chief health officer’s ability to impose vaccine mandates. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We are hopeful of gaining support from Labor, the LNP and the crossbench for the amendment we are putting forward,” a spokesperson for Robbie Katter’s office said. The party will also vote against the Public Health bill, with Member for Hill, Shane Knuth, claiming the extension of emergency powers “makes no sense” now that almost 92% of Queenslanders have received two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine. The health minister, Yvette D’Ath, said the emergency powers were “critical” for a swift and effective response towards health issues that arise during the pandemic. She said within the next six months, a combination of influenza and Covid-19 cases will put increasing pressure on the health system. “It is clear we are on the cusp of a second wave,” D’Ath said. “There may be a point in the future where restrictions are not required at all. But we are not there yet. “It would be reckless to withdraw all the measures on one occasion as soon as we entered this wave.”",News/Australia news,Greens and LNP in rare agreement over Qld government’s pandemic powers,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/30/greens-and-lnp-in-rare-agreement-over-qld-governments-pandemic-powers
