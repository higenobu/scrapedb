5/11/2022,"For the first time in the magazine's 58-year history, the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue will feature a model who is showing her cesarean section scar. The empowering moment came together through a partnership between Frida Mom founder Chelsea Hirschhorn and the publication with the intention of celebrating all moms who bare C-section scars. There is also an aim to authentically show the beauty of motherhood and help women who've gone through a C-section feel proud, while additionally normalizing conversations about all postpartum recoveries and bodies. The featured model, Kelly Hughes, is a C-section mom who has previously worked with the brand. Hirschhorn's brand, Frida Mom, is on a mission to support women through their physical transformation into motherhood and recently launched C-Section Recovery, which is a first-of-its-kind product line designed to improve the maternal post-op recovery experience. Frida Mom has faced obstacles when trying to get out its messaging, including in 2020, when the brand said its Oscars advertisement was not accepted by ABC or the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to run during the broadcast, which airs on the network, due to the Academy's guidelines for being ""too graphic with partial nudity and product demonstration."" The magazine and Frida Mom are also partnering as part of SI Swimsuit's ""Pay With Change"" initiative to positively shift the mainstream cultural narratives associated with women's bodies -- specifically, mothers who gave birth via C-section. ""Joining Sports Illustrated as its first official Pay With Change brand partner is a perfect fit for Frida Mom because they have a valuable platform to disrupt the traditional narrative around women's bodies -- especially those they feature who are mothers,"" Hirschhorn, who is also a mother of four, said in a statement. ""We're thrilled that Sports Illustrated Swimsuit appreciates the importance of highlighting these women authentically -- C-section scars and all -- and welcome the progress we will make together as a result of this shared commitment,"" she added. ""GMA"" previously reported that a cesarean section is a surgical procedure performed to deliver a baby through the birthing person's abdomen, instead of the vagina. It is a procedure that in some cases may be planned and in others is done on a more emergency basis if the labor is not progressing or if the health of the mother or the baby is in danger, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). More than one million children are birthed via cesarean deliveries, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

5/11/2022,"Alabama jail guard Vicky White fatally shot herself as she and escaped murder suspect Casey White were being chased by law enforcement in Indiana on Monday, ending an extraordinary 11 days on the run that captivated the nation. “We’ve captured them,” Vanderburgh County Sheriff Dave Wedding said in Evansville, Indiana, a five-hour drive from the Florence, Alabama, lockup the pair had vanished from. Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton, Vicky White’s former boss, told reporters: “We got a dangerous man off the street today. He is never going to see the light of day again. That is a good thing—for not just our community. That’s a good thing for our country.” After Vicky White signed Casey White out of jail for a phantom court appointment, the duo kept a step ahead of investigators—fleeing Alabama for parts unknown. End of police chase — Evansville, Indiana. Car badly damaged. pic.twitter.com/8KMN8rezxm — Brian Entin (@BrianEntin) May 9, 2022 It appears they were eventually undone by a stolen car. Late last week, investigators found Vicky White’s rust-colored SUV in a tow yard after the Whites abandoned it off an interstate near Bethesda, Tennessee. Authorities said another car, a black Ford pickup truck, was reported stolen in the same area around the same time. Investigators tracked the truck to Evansville, about 100 miles north of Bethesda, on Monday. A man who resembled Casey White was spotted exiting the vehicle at the car wash, officials said, citing surveillance images. A Sunday night tip led federal marshals and police to a hotel, where they set up surveillance. On Monday, Vicky White came out wearing a wig and got into a gray vehicle with Casey White, Northern District of Alabama U.S. Marshal Marty Keely told CNN. Investigators tailed the Whites—who are not related—and a chase ensued. It ended with the fugitives’ vehicle in a rollover crash. “U.S. Marshals task force officers intercepted them—actually collided with them to end the pursuit,” Wedding said. “We got Casey White out who immediately announced that his wife had shot herself in the head and that he didn’t do it,’’ Keely said, adding that the Whites were not married. Vicky White, 56, was taken to a hospital with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, while 38-year-old Casey White was taken into custody. Vanderburgh County Coroner Steve Lockyear confirmed Vicky died at a local hospital shortly after arriving. Wanted Jail Guard Vicky White Was Caught on Video at Motel When asked if it was surprising that Vicky White had pulled the trigger, rather than her road-trip buddy, a hardened criminal with a reported death wish, Wedding mused: “With criminals and criminal minds, they are very unpredictable. We don’t take anything they say with merit and they can change on a dime.” Vicky White, the Lauderdale County jail’s assistant director of corrections, was by all accounts a model employee for the first 25 years she worked at the facility. Then, on April 29, she told co-workers she was taking Casey White to a mental health appointment at the courthouse. They never arrived. “You don’t know who you can trust,” Singleton told reporters. “You know, I had every bit of trust in Vicky White. She had been an exemplary employee. And what in the world provoked her, or prompted her, to pull something like this, I don’t know. I don’t know if we’ll ever know.” Instead of the courthouse, Vicky and Casey White were said to have driven her patrol car to a nearby shopping mall. There, they jumped into the Ford Edge SUV that she had bought days earlier using a fake identity, and took off running. “This escape was obviously well-planned and calculated,” Singleton said. “A lot of preparation went into this. They had plenty of resources, had cash, had vehicles. Had everything they needed to pull this off.” Investigators concluded shortly after the inmate and guard’s initial disappearance that the two had had a “special relationship.” Inmates reported that Vicky White had given Casey White his trays laden with “extra food,” Singleton said last week. “He was getting special privileges,” the sheriff told WAAY 31. “She was doing special things for him that other inmates didn’t get. That he was getting treated special.” There was no immediate evidence suggesting that anyone else had been involved in the escape, according to authorities. Guard Who Fled With Murder Inmate Was Cashed Up and Eyeing Florida, Her Family Says Casey White, a hulking 6-foot-9 inmate decorated with white supremacist tattoos, was serving 75 years for a 2015 “crime spree” that included, but was not limited to, a home invasion, carjacking, killing a dog, and attempting to kill an ex-girlfriend. In September 2020, he was charged with capital murder over the “brutal” stabbing of a 58-year-old woman, the U.S. Marshals Service said. Shortly after the indictment, he had been moved to the Lauderdale County jail to await trial for the woman’s murder. During his pre-sentencing proceedings in 2015, Casey White allegedly threatened to kill the ex-girlfriend, as well as his sister, if he ever escaped from jail, the Marshals Service said last Wednesday. The inmate also said “that he wanted police to kill him,” according to the agency. Investigators had taken “appropriate protective actions” to ensure the two women’s safety while Casey White was on the run, the agency said in a statement. Read more at The Daily Beast.

5/11/2022,"By Gwladys Fouche and Victoria Klesty KIRKENES, Norway (Reuters) - Kirkenes, a Norwegian town a stone's throw from Russia, was for over three decades a symbol of cross-border harmony in the Arctic. That came to a crashing end when Russia invaded Ukraine. Since then people have been adapting to the new realities. One is the prospect that neighbouring Finland could join Norway in NATO, with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto expected to say on Thursday it should apply to the military alliance. Companies here are seeking to reduce their dependence on doing business with Russia even as Norway has made some exceptions to international sanctions. Kirkenes residents can cross into Russia with a visa-free permit while Russians can come and work in the area. Out of the town's 3,500 residents, 400 are Russians. There are also about 30 Ukrainians. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, ""many have felt grief, anger, frustration,"" said Lene Norum Bergeng, mayor of Soer-Varanger municipality which includes Kirkenes. ""It has been a surreal time. We have lived in peace for many years and now our neighbour is going to war with one of its neighbours. It has affected us all,"" she said from her office, on the same square as the Russian consulate. From Kirkenes, the Russian border is a 15-minute drive away while Finland's is 50 minutes away. Both are closer than the neighbouring Norwegian municipality. ""It is up to Finland to decide whether they want to join NATO,"" said Norum Bergeng. ""Should they want to, we should welcome then. I am very glad that Norway is part of NATO."" LIVING TOGETHER Street signs in both Norwegian and Russian were put up decades ago to welcome Russians. A petition is now circulating to take them down, though there are as yet not enough signatures for the city council to discuss it, the mayor said. Russian residents Reuters spoke to said they still felt as welcome as before the invasion. ""I have had no problems, no one has come up to me and said 'hey, you Russian',"" said welder Gleb Karionov, 43, during a break in his shift at the Kimek shipyard. Similarly, a Ukrainian refugee who arrived in Kirkenes in April said the Russians she had met had been ""very kind"" to her. ""They are not aggressive. And we try not to speak about politics and such provocative questions,"" said Katerina Bezruk, 27, a teacher who fled the eastern region of Luhansk with her two-year-old daughter Arena and now lives with her aunt. Some are finding new meaning to their work. Evgeny Goman, a theatre director from Murmansk who has lived in Kirkenes since January, is working with Russian artists in exile to present different voices of Russia, away from the militaristic officialdom. ""With the start of the war, we really understood why we do art...why it is a powerful instrument,"" the 42-year-old said at the art gallery that houses a regional collective of curators and artists, Girls on the Bridge. ECONOMIC HIT At the Kimek shipyard, which last year derived 70% of its revenues from fitting Russian vessels, CEO Greger Mannsverk worries about restructuring the business without losing his 80 employees to other employers, 15 of whom are Russians. While non-EU Norway has applied most international sanctions, it has not shut its ports to Russian fishing vessels, a lifeline for the ports of Arctic Norway like Kirkenes. Mannsverk would have laid off half the shipyard's staff had Norway applied that particular sanction, he said. Kimek's facility in Murmansk continues to operate, independently from the main facility in Kirkenes. ""I am planning for a future when the Russian clients are not the major ones. The percentage today is 70%, maybe it should be 20%,"" he said at the cavernous yard where a Russian trawler was being readied. Will cross-border cooperation resume to the full sometimes in the future? Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere is hopeful it will. ""There will be a day after, I don't know when,"" he said during a visit to the town. ""I think the spirit of the people living in this municipality is that borders should be respected, but there should also be contacts. We have to live through it.""
