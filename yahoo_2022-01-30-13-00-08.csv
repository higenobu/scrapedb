1/30/2022,"Trump used a 1968 Al Wilson song to compare immigrants to a freezing snake that bites its rescuer. Trump recited lyrics to ""The Snake"" at rallies throughout his first campaign for president. Wilson's family said the singer would likely not agree with Trump's use of the song. Former President Donald Trump once again used 'The Snake"" to push anti-immigrant sentiments at a rally in Conroe, Texas, on Saturday. The crowd erupted in applause after Trump asked if they wanted to hear the song, which he referred to as a poem. The 1968 soul hit, which was sung by Al Wilson, a Black man, is about a ""tender-hearted woman"" who saw ""a poor half-frozen snake"" and took it in. The woman ""wrapped him up all cozy in a coverture of silk"" and ""laid him by the fireside with some honey and some milk."" When the woman returned, the snake was ""revived"" but ""instead of saying thanks, that snake gave her a vicious bite (ooh),"" the lyrics continue. When the woman cries and asks the snake why he bit her, the snake replies that she knew he was a snake before she took him in. ""And that's what's happening to the United States of America with immigration,"" Trump said. ""I think it's pretty accurate, do you agree?"" Trump has recited the song – using the snake as a metaphor for immigrants – at multiple rallies throughout his first bid for president. In 2016, Wilson's daughter, Alene Wilson-Harris, told Business Insider's Allan Smith that she's not sure her father would ""see eye-to-eye"" with Trump or his use of the song. ""While I think that he would've had, at least some sort of appreciation for the fact that his music is appreciated by Trump to the affect that he would utilize the song, there are some things in my father's life that may have been an interesting perspective for him to have to grapple with in light of how [the song] was used,"" she said. ""And, some of the things that are the platform of Trump."" The song was written by Oscar Brown Jr., an African-American activist and musician, PBS reported. His daughter, Maggie Brown, told PBS she was actually relieved that Trump cited the song to Wilson, adding that she ""hated the idea of him using Oscar's words to create such a platform."" ""Wait until Republicans find out that he's quoting a former Black nationalist and former communist party member,"" she said.

1/30/2022,"After nearly a week of driving, Canadian truckers arrived at the nation's capital this weekend. What began as a protest against vaccine mandates evolved to include opposition to other measures. Trudeau was moved as a precaution, but as of Saturday evening the protest remained peaceful. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his family were moved from their home in Ottawa to a secret location as thousands of people descended on Canada's capital Saturday to protest vaccine mandates for truckers and other public health restrictions. Trudeau was relocated over security concerns earlier in the day, CBC reported, though the protests had remained peaceful as of Saturday evening, with no charges brought against any demonstrators, Ottawa police said. —Benny (@bennyjohnson) January 29, 2022 Truckers began arriving on Friday after nearly a week of driving across Canada. The ""Freedom Convoy"" began as a protest against COVID-19 vaccine mandates for truckers who travel over the US-Canada border. Canada's mandate, imposed on January 15, requires truckers to present proof of vaccination in order to cross the border. Truckers without a vaccine are required to quarantine and take a COVID-19 test when they return from the US. A similar mandate for truckers in the US was imposed on January 22. Insider's Grace Kay previously reported that the mandates could worsen supply shortages and price increases in both countries. Trudeau said at a press conference Monday that the vast majority of Canadian truckers were already vaccinated. ""Almost 90% of truckers in Canada are already vaccinated, and the best way to continue to prevent supply chain disruptions is to ensure that everyone gets vaccinated,"" he said. Since the convoy began, the protest has evolved to include other groups and people who are not truckers who oppose a variety of public health measures and government overreach in the pandemic. On Saturday, big rigs and people on foot filled the streets around Canada's parliament as police monitored the crowds. ""I'm not able to work no more because I can't cross the border,"" Csava Vizi, a trucker who said he was the primary provider for his family, told Reuters from inside his truck outside parliament. ""I refuse the vaccine."" One Ottawa resident present and carrying a sign that said ""Justin Trudeau makes me ashamed to be a Canadian"" told the outlet: ""Myself and a lot of other people are here because we're just sick of the vaccine mandates and the lockdowns."" Despite security concerns in the days before the protest, Reuter reported the scene was peaceful and mostly ""felt like a very cold street party, punctuated by blaring truck horns.""

1/30/2022,"The parents of a 10-year-old Virginia girl who died of COVID-19 after her teacher assigned her the role of “class nurse” tore into the school on Saturday for what they described as a half-hearted investigation into her death. Teresa Sperry died Sept. 27, just five days after she started experiencing a headache—and six days after her parents say she was tasked with walking sick children to the nurse’s office. Her parents weren’t even informed she had tested positive until two days after her death. She was conscripted into the role of class nurse at her school, Hillpoint Elementary, on Sept. 21, which required her to accompany sick students on their way to the nurse, according to the school’s report. The school has maintained, however, that strict protocols were in place when dealing with any children exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms. The school’s report makes no mention of any times when Sperry may have been exposed to the virus, instead finding that she had walked a student to the nurse’s office for an inhaler and an arm injury two days before she first experienced a headache, which then developed into more severe symptoms. Her teacher told investigators that neither Teresa nor the student she was helping exhibited symptoms at the time, nor did Teresa have to help students who did appear to be infected, the report states. Obligating a student to escort sick students to the nurse at all reportedly ran counter to Suffolk Public Schools COVID-19 protocols, however. Her father, Jeff Sperry, told The Virginian-Pilot, “They made her do this job without parental consent. Having a child walk students to the nurse during the pandemic? It is nonsense. It is insane. Had anybody asked me or informed me, I would have said no.” The three-page report on the 10-year-old’s death showed no effort to conduct thorough contact tracing, according to her parents. They obtained the dossier on Teresa’s death through a Freedom of Information Act request. The school did not voluntarily provide it to them. “If you print it out, it is three pages,” her mother Nicole Sperry added. “If they really wanted to do contact tracing they would have done more.” Teresa’s parents feel the school has failed to help them understand what happened to their daughter. “I feel that the investigation report is incredibly incomplete,” Jeff Sperry said. “How do they know who she was around while she sat outside the nurse’s clinic? They did not look at the cameras. There is nothing in it about interviewing the security guard, who would have seen my daughter going to the clinic. They did not interview anyone else that would have seen her.” Suffolk Public Schools said in a statement to the Pilot that no protocols had been broken: “Students who attend Hillpoint Elementary School who are suspected of having COVID symptoms are reported to the nurse or office with a phone call to indicate a suspected ‘Code C.’” Read more at The Daily Beast.

1/30/2022,"Former K-pop idol and Big Bang member Seungri will serve a reduced jail sentence after pleading guilty to all charges after previously denying all but one.

Seungri, who faces a total of nine charges following the Burning Sun scandal, appeared for his appeal trial on Thursday and reportedly expressed remorse for his actions.

The 31-year-old pled guilty to only one of his charges last August — violating foreign exchange policies related to overseas gambling — resulting in a three-year jail sentence and a 1.15 billion Korean won (approximately $950,000) fine.

Seungri’s other charges included (1) violation of the Act on the Aggravated Punishment, etc. of Specific Economic Crimes, (2) violation of the Act on Special Cases Concerning the Punishment, etc. of Sexual Crimes, (3) violation of the Food Sanitation Act, (4) embezzlement, (5) habitual gambling, (6) prostitution mediation, (7) purchase of prostitution services and (8) special violence instigation, according to Soompi.

On Thursday, after Seungri acknowledged guilt to all other charges, the South Korean High Court for Armed Forces retained his fine but nearly halved his jail sentence to one year and six months because of his new stance.

Seungri’s trials took place in a military court since he enlisted in the South Korean army – a requirement for men – even under investigation, according to the South China Morning Post.

The Burning Sun scandal is regarded by many as the biggest controversy in K-pop history. It is named after the nightclub where Seungri had worked as executive director and facilitated prostitution, drug trafficking and police corruption.

In addition to Seungri, several other celebrities and politicians were involved in the scandal. Singer Jung Joon-young, who was among them, admitted to filming himself while having sex with women — without their consent — and subsequently sharing the videos in a chatroom.

Twitter users had mixed reactions over the reduction of Seungri’s sentence.

“Punk a** motherf*cker lied for YEARS about the women HE hurt. And the ONLY reason he even admitted the truth was to save himself. What an absolute disgrace. F*ck Seungri now and always,” one Twitter user wrote.

Another commented, “If you have been following Seungri's case all this time, today's verdict doesn't have to change anything for you if you really know the truth. Every person who followed his case knows pretty well that he is just scapegoat in the hands of a corrupted system, and nothing else.”
