1/28/2022,"A Virginia cop and his wife are both facing criminal charges after she secretly recorded him to prove he was having an affair—and accidentally captured what might be key information in a felony trial. Sharon Maddox, 41, admitted in a bond hearing Wednesday to bugging her husband, Chesapeake Police officer Sean Maddox, after she became concerned he was cheating on her last April. She told local news outlet 10 On Your Side that she surreptitiously placed a recording device in his squad car for three days after finding a blonde hair in his car and some suspicious activity on his Facebook. According to her lawyer, Kristin Paulding, the tape confirmed what Sharon suspected: that her husband was sleeping with a local 911 dispatcher. The recording might have remained secret forever if the dispatcher hadn’t accused Sean Maddox weeks later of abducting and raping her on April 27—the day after his wife put the recording device in his car. On June 1, Maddox was arrested on charges including abduction, rape, and sodomy. Sharon’s lawyer said she willingly handed over her recordings to her husband’s defense attorney after he was arrested, in an attempt to prove his innocence. When Chesapeake police started questioning Sharon about the recordings, Paulding said, she thought they were looking for evidence against him. Instead, they charged her this week with wiretapping for making the secret tape. My Friend Was Raped By a Cop: Why Acquittal of NYPD's Kenneth Moreno, Franklin Mata, Was an Injustice “She was definitely a little blindsided by it because she didn't know they were actually investigating her,” Paulding said. “She believed they wanted the recording to help with the case against her husband, which was already going forward.” Maddox is a 13-year veteran of the Chesapeake Police Department, where he served as a lieutenant before losing his job over the charges. According to the 911 dispatcher’s court testimony, the two began having an affair in January of last year, which quickly progressed to them having sex at least once a week. By April, however, the dispatcher said, she had grown suspicious that the officer was not going to leave his wife, and she began thinking about ending the relationship. On April 26, she claims, Sean Maddox gave her $100 cash to book a hotel room and ordered her to meet him there that night, as they often did. The dispatcher claims she booked the hotel room, but went on a date with another police officer instead—during which time she claims Maddox called and texted her 25 times. On her drive home early that morning, she claims, she was pulled over by a Chesapeake patrol car, which turned out to be Maddox. She claims he threatened to charge her with a fake offense and forced her to go to the hotel, where he proceeded to rape her orally, anally, and vaginally. She also says he filmed parts of the encounter and threatened to send it to anyone else she tried to date. Days later, according to an arrest warrant obtained by 13 News Now, Maddox texted her to say that she had “no idea how hard I had to try to control myself and not do bad things,” later clarifying: “To you, a lot of things, hurt you.” “And it’s still an option,’ he allegedly added. “Keep your head on a swivel.” Maddox’s defense attorneys paint a different version of events, claiming the dispatcher was a scorned lover who turned on the officer when he refused to leave his wife. They claimed at the hearing that she sent multiple text messages in the days after the alleged assault saying she loved him and wanted to be with him, and accusing him of “ghosting” her when he did not respond. (The woman said she did not recall sending those messages at that time.) In a statement to The Daily Beast, attorney Taite Westendorf called the case a “real life example of Fatal Attraction” and said the woman had “admitted to being in love with Mr. Maddox and becoming emotionally unstable when he refused to leave his family for her.” “Mr. Maddox is absolutely innocent of all charges and looks forward to a jury of his peers exercising the common sense that has been sorely missing from the government’s approach to this case,” he said. Sharon Maddox’s attorney, meanwhile, says she cannot understand why police would pursue charges against the veteran Animal Control sergeant when neither her husband nor the dispatcher have requested them. “She’s just trying to protect her own interests and see if her marriage is falling apart—which in fact it was—and then they turn around and her own employer just kind of sticks it to her,” Paulding said. Sharon has yet to be indicted but she has lost her job with Animal Control. Maddox is expected to go to trial May 17. Both Paulding and Westendorf say their clients are supporting each other through their respective trials, though they declined to comment on their current living arrangements. At his bail hearing, Sharon told a judge that Maddox could come back to their family home if he was released, and Paulding said Maddox was in court for her preliminary hearing on Wednesday. “They’re definitely a unified front in supporting each other in each of their cases,” she said.

1/28/2022,"Former President Donald Trump is facing serious backlash from die-hard loyalists over his decision to intervene in a Tennessee House race, with his supporters accusing him of spurning a staunch Republican ally who’s running. Trump on Tuesday evening endorsed Morgan Ortagus, who served as a State Department spokesperson during his administration and is pondering a run for a Middle Tennessee-based congressional district. The announcement has caused a firestorm, with far-right, high-profile backers ranging from North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn to conservative activist Candace Owens taking to social media to voice their support for Robby Starbuck, a rival candidate who’s been a mainstay of the pro-Trump movement. Even Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, one of the former president’s most prominent supporters, promoted a tweet outlining criticisms of Ortagus. The gripes have included everything from Ortagus’ support of Jeb Bush in the 2016 GOP primaries to her being photographed with President Joe Biden and having her wedding officiated by Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Amid the criticism, two of the former president’s top lieutenants, eldest son Donald Trump Jr. and social media director Dan Scavino, have privately voiced their displeasure over what Trump’s inner circle concedes was a hasty endorsement rollout, according to two people familiar with the internal discussions. Starbuck himself is far from a sure-fire primary bet: He’s a first-time candidate and a relative newcomer to the district, running in what is expected to be a large field of formidable Republicans, and he has posted lukewarm fundraising numbers. Still, the episode represents perhaps the most intense blowback Trump has received from loyalists since leaving office — and a potential test of the former president's credibility with some of his fiercest defenders. While he has endorsed in races up and down the ballot ahead of this year’s midterms, few of them have generated substantial criticism from allies, though there have been ongoing questions about how carefully Trump has made his endorsement decisions. “This in a lot of ways is a watershed moment for, I’ll say, the entire Trump team,” said Daniel Bostic, a conservative activist whose Twitter page has closely documented the backlash. “And it should be, to be honest, because it is being perceived as a back-stab to his own base.” Unlike many of the former president’s other endorsements, the decision to get behind Ortagus unfolded quickly. The would-be candidate, joined by her family, met with Trump on Monday at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, where she informed him she was considering running. In the hours after their meeting, Trump began asking a range of people what they thought of Ortagus. By Tuesday evening, the former president had decided to move ahead with the announcement. He released a statement calling the 39-year-old Ortagus, a former Fox News contributor, “an absolute warrior” for his movement and saying she was “fantastic in her role” at the State Department. “Morgan Ortagus will have my Complete and Total Endorsement if she decides to run!” Trump said. The pushback was swift. “Absolutely not,” wrote Ned Ryun, a conservative activist, on Twitter. “Nope. Trump has this completely wrong,” Owens tweeted. “Trump is now firmly in the establishment camp,” wrote John Cardillo, another conservative activist. Within a few hours, Bostic, who was a producer of the pro-Trump documentary “The Plot Against the President,” began pumping out tweets with photographs of Ortagus alongside Biden and Ginsberg while noting that she worked on Bush’s 2016 presidential campaign. The following evening, the Republic PAC Twitter account circulated a TV clip from 2016 of Ortagus saying that she’s “not a Trump fan.” Within some corners of Trump’s inner circle, there were complaints about what they regarded as an impulsive, poorly planned and unnecessary endorsement, especially given that Ortagus isn’t an announced candidate. Others, however, defended the move, saying they’d received widespread positive feedback about Ortagus. They also contended the pushback was unfair, pointing out that Ortagus steadfastly defended the administration’s policies during her time at the State Department and as a Fox News contributor, and that she had a role on Trump’s first campaign. During a November appearance as guest host on “The View,” Ortagus went after House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), a prominent Trump antagonist. Ortagus has gotten backup from the likes of Robert O’Brien, who served as Trump’s national security adviser and on Tuesday evening published a tweet announcing his support for her. There is also a degree of skepticism within some corners of Trump’s orbit about whether Starbuck would be the strongest candidate in a potentially crowded primary. While Starbuck, whose full legal name is Robert Starbuck Newsom, has developed a reputation as a Twitter personality and has garnered support from out-of-state Trump backers, he has lived in the district for only a few years and never run for office. The primary is expected to draw a number of well-known local officials. The list of potential candidates includes former Tennessee state House Speaker Beth Harwell and Maury County Mayor Andy Ogles. Apart from the online backlash, it remains unclear whether Ortagus will actually enter the congressional contest. While she has begun reaching out to strategists and local party officials, she has yet to make a final decision. Ortagus, who has been working in the health-care industry since the Trump administration ended, has been living in the area for about a year. Whether she jumps in or not, the drama has taken center stage within Trump-world. During a Wednesday evening fundraiser at the Miami home of pro-Trump megadonor Peter Thiel, donors were abuzz about the skirmish, inquiring about how the endorsement had unfolded, according to several attendees. “Ortagus’ endorsement really came as a complete shock,” Bostic said. “My phone started blowing up.” CORRECTION: A previous version of this report misstated candidate Robby Starbuck’s full legal name. It is Robert Starbuck Newsom.",Politics/Politico,Trump faces MAGA revolt over endorsement,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-faces-maga-revolt-over-234239167.html
1/28/2022,"Lingerie and loungewear start-ups are making waves in the underwear world. This week alone, Rihanna’s Savage x Fenty lingerie and Kim Kardashian’s Skims innerwear brands revealed hundreds of millions of dollars ($365 million collectively) in additional funding to help scale their businesses. Those might be the biggest names, but there’s also Parade, ThirdLove, Cuup and Sofia Vergara’s EBY, among others. These are all intimates brands that have secured millions of additional investment dollars in the last few years. More from WWD Photos from HBO's 'The Gilded Age' 'Pam & Tommy' Red Carpet Photos Nino Cerruti Dies at 91: Photos from the Fairchild Archive Courtesy Photo Larger companies are getting in the games, too. Stakes have been claimed in names like Lively, Spanx and Playful Promises in an attempt to capitalize off of the momentum. Blackstone bought a majority stake in Spanx in November 2021 for an undisclosed sum, valuing the shapewear brand at $1.2 billion.
 Meanwhile, a handful of other digital innerwear darlings are rumored to be courting investors in the hopes of finding a buyer on the public market. Courtesy Photo At the same time, everyone from Danielle Bernstein’s We Wore What brand to established players like Zara and Karl Lagerfeld are entering the lingerie space, eager to take share from a market that has historically been dominated by Victoria’s Secret and HanesBrands. There’s also a growing number of niche innerwear businesses, offering things like period-panties, gender-free underwear and subscription lingerie services. Anyone who says the pandemic-induced-innerwear moment is over is clearly mistaken. “People are still shopping lingerie,” Todd Mick, executive director of fashion apparel at market research firm NPD Group, told WWD. “The customer just wants that comfort lifestyle; wants that lounge lifestyle. And there’s that sort of mixing up of lounge, sleep and active that’s really becoming a wardrobe staple. “And lingerie is a self-care purchase,” he added. “It’s something that’s very intimate. Putting on lingerie is kind of that first layer to feeling great and looking good.”  The U.S. women’s intimate apparel category, which includes sleepwear, grew 16 percent in fall 2021, year-over-year. (Sleepwear alone was up 69 percent in that same timeframe.) That’s on top of two years of solid growth where the category grew by approximately $5 billion. And while sales in the innerwear industry will likely decelerate in the first half of 2022 — thanks to supply chain headwinds and post-holiday consumer shopping fatigue — Mick said the momentum will likely pick up in the back half of the year. NPD is anticipating the category to grow by 3 percent to 5 percent each year.  “That’s kind of a steep change of growth for categories that were traditionally very mature and stable,” Mick said. “The truth is the [lingerie] business is still in a very, very healthy structure. And intimates was actually a category that continued to do well during COVID[-19].” Courtesy Photo Comfort continues to be a consumer favorite. But so are lace and push-up bras (up 4 percent in fall 2021, year-over-year). Mick added that “hybrid” bras, or bras that offer both support and style are increasingly sought after.  “Women do want to look pretty and they’re looking for more lace-embellished and push-up styles that give them shape. And that’s indicative of them wanting to go out into the world,” he said.  Meanwhile, Rihanna and Kardashian are using their star power and social media skills to convince intimates shoppers to buy their version of sexy undergarments — and control more and more of the lingerie experience. Even pre-pandemic, both superstars have been able to speak to an era where many consumers have collectively rejected rigid beauty standards, often opting for comfort instead.  Kevin Mazur / Getty Images It’s little surprise then that both Savage and Skims have revealed plans to expand internationally, open brick-and-mortar stores and move into new categories, including men’s basics. (Rihanna launched men’s in fall 2020, while Kardashian hinted at men’s shapewear in 2019.)  But the notion that lingerie giant Victoria’s Secret is dead in the water, is far from true. In fact, it’s still the market share leader in the U.S. women’s intimate apparel market. And while Victoria’s Secret has lost share in recent years — from roughly 32 percent in 2015 to its current 21 percent, according to NPD Group’s consumer-tracking service — the business is still sizable.  Courtesy Photo The firm, which spun off of Bath & Body Works in August to become a stand-alone company on the public market, is in the midst of a major transformation, trying to rebrand itself as the ultimate advocate for women in an attempt to win back consumers — and still has substantial sales volume to show for its efforts.  Victoria’s Secret topped out in 2016 with $7.78 billion in annual revenues and more than 1,100 stores around the country. While much smaller today, Victoria’s Secret generated approximately $1.4 billion in revenues in the most recent quarter, helping the retailer log $75 million in net profits. It also has more than 900 stores around the nation and a market cap of $4.48 billion.  The digital darlings, by contrast, are receiving outsized attention with little public information regarding their sales — or if they’re even profitable.  “The one cautious thing about funding versus revenue is that Victoria’s Secret is 20 percent of the market. That’s a really large business,” Mick said. “Whereas, a lot of these digital native brands are in that sort of $200 million to $500 million range. So they’re still relatively small, compared to the big guys.” NPD uses checkout data to track sales volumes at various brands.  Courtesy Photo twitter.com “When I think of what Rihanna is great at, one is, she does an incredible job of inclusivity, size diversity, body diversity,” Mick said. “Her lingerie is very popularly priced. It’s very affordable. And it’s on the sexy side. So, yes, that’s kind of playing in Victoria’s Secret’s space.  “But I think for [Victoria’s Secret], while they’re building back up in their sexy business, they’re growing in that more comfort, lounge, wire-free area, as well,” he continued. “That’s an area that they never played in at all. And that represents about 50 percent of the market. So there’s huge growth potential for Victoria’s Secret.”  Mick added that all of these brands will need to continue to innovate in order to keep up with the competition.  Courtesy Photo AEO “It’s really about understanding their assortment and growing their assortment in ways that attract new customers to the assortment,” he said. “Aerie [owned by American Eagle Outfitters] has done a good job of that. They’ve taken a core bra business and built and built and built upon the merchandising segment. And that’s why Aerie is so accessible and that’s what these smaller brands need to be doing.  “When we look at our top 25 brands, in the [lingerie] brands that we track, generally, half are doing well and half are not doing well,” Mick added. “When we look at the past year, all of the brands have [had] positive sales comps. So, there’s all this new activity, with the Rihannas, with the Parades [of the world], with Aerie. But the truth is, everyone is doing well, because the consumer is really voting in this category.” Sign up for WWD's Newsletter.

1/28/2022,"McALESTER, Okla. (AP) — Oklahoma executed a man Thursday for the brutal slayings of two hotel workers during a robbery in 2001. Donald Grant, 46, received a lethal injection at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester and was declared dead at 10:16 a.m. It was the first execution in the U.S. in 2022 and the third in Oklahoma since the state resumed lethal injections in October following a nearly seven-year hiatus. “Yo, God, I got this,"" Grant said while lying strapped to the gurney, delivering his disjointed last words for two minutes. “No medication. I didn't take nothing. Brooklyn for life."" Grant at one point began chanting unintelligibly. Even after Grant was told his two minutes to deliver his last words had ended and the microphone inside the execution chamber was turned off, Grant continued to speak to about seven witnesses who attended the execution on his behalf. A few minutes later, Grant's eyelids began to droop and he appeared to be sleeping. After a doctor entered the room to conduct a consciousness check, rubbing his sternum and calling his name, Grant could be heard snoring as a prison official declared him unconscious at 10:09 p.m. He appeared to stop breathing about two minutes later. Shirl Pilcher, the sister of one of Grant's victims, Brenda McElyea, said her family felt that justice had been served. “Although Donald Grant's execution does not bring Brenda back, it allows us all to finally move forward knowing justice was served,"" Pilcher said after witnessing his execution. Grant had asked a federal judge to temporarily halt his execution, arguing that he should be reinstated as a plaintiff in a separate lawsuit challenging Oklahoma’s three-drug lethal injection protocol as presenting a risk of unconstitutional pain and suffering. But both a federal judge and a three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver previously denied that request. The U.S. Supreme Court denied Grant’s request on Wednesday. Several Oklahoma death row inmates with pending execution dates have sought to delay their executions after John Grant convulsed on the gurney and vomited after receiving the first dose of midazolam, a sedative, during his October execution. John Grant's execution was the state's first since problems with the state's lethal injection protocols in 2014 and 2015 led to a de facto moratorium. Richard Glossip was just hours away from being executed in September 2015 when prison officials realized they received the wrong lethal drug. It was later learned the same wrong drug had been used to execute an inmate in January 2015. The drug mix-ups followed a botched execution in April 2014 in which inmate Clayton Lockett struggled on a gurney before dying 43 minutes into his lethal injection — and after the state’s prisons chief ordered executioners to stop. During a clemency hearing in November, Donald Grant admitted killing Brenda McElyea and Felicia Suzette Smith so that there would be no witnesses to his robbery of the Del City hotel. Court records show both women were shot and stabbed, and Smith was also bludgeoned. Prosecutors say both women also begged him to spare their lives before he killed them. During November's hearing, he expressed “deep, sincere remorse” and apologized for the killings, but the state’s Pardon and Parole Board voted 4-1 against recommending clemency. “I can't change that,"" he said of the crime while speaking to the board. “If I could, I would, but I can't change that."" Two of Donald Grant's attorneys, Susan Otto and Emma Rolls from the federal public defender's office, argued that he was mentally ill and had suffered brain damage that made him a candidate for mercy. They also discussed Grant’s childhood growing up in a New York City housing project during the crack epidemic of the 1980s, a time when he was frequently beaten and members of his family experienced alcoholism, drug addiction and mental illness. But the board also heard from members of McElyea's family, who tearfully urged them to reject clemency for him. Filcher, McElyea’s sister, recalled the pain she experienced when she had to tell their father that McElyea had been killed. “I had to call my dad and tell him his daughter, his baby girl, was dead,” Filcher said. “I had never seen him cry, but that night I heard him weep and it broke my heart.” The U.S. Supreme Court considered Thursday whether to let Alabama execute a death row inmate who claims an intellectual disability combined with the state’s inattention cost him a chance to avoid lethal injection. The state said it was preparing to execute Matthew Reeves, 43, in case the court allowed it to go forward as scheduled at 6 p.m. CST.",U.S./Associated Press,Oklahoma executes man for 2001 slayings of 2 hotel workers,https://news.yahoo.com/oklahoma-prepares-execute-man-2001-045038423.html
