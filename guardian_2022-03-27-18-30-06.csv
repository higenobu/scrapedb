3/27/2022,"Hospitals, schools and the civil service will suffer a “mass exodus” of key staff unless millions of public sector employees receive pay rises that at least match the spiralling rate of inflation, union leaders warn on Sunday. After the chancellor Rishi Sunak’s spring statement offered no more money to public services last week, the prospect of long and bitter battles over pay look certain as the cost of living crisis grows. The prospect of pay disputes with the public sector is another big headache for Sunak, whose net approval rating has dropped to an all-time low of minus 4 points (down 15 on two weeks ago) according to Opinium’s latest poll. Before this week his lowest net approval was plus 7. Last night, the country’s largest union, Unison, representing health service, education and other public service workers, said that unless members received “inflation busting” rises, staff would leave for better paid work in the private sector. Unison will give evidence to the NHS pay review body on Tuesday and will also highlight this week how many employers on the high street including supermarkets, coffee shops and logistics firms​, are among those offering wages higher than the lowest hourly rates in the NHS. One of the main teaching unions, the NASUWT, has already submitted evidence to its pay review body calling for a multi-year pay award for teachers, starting with a 12% award from September this year. The union says that successive years of pay freezes and below-inflation awards mean teachers have suffered a 19% real-terms erosion in their pay since 2010. Analysis by the TUC of official data shows that average real-terms pay in the public sector was down £81 a month in January 2022 compared with a year before. In addition the forecasts alongside the spring statement from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) show that average real pay for all workers (public and private sectors) is set to fall by 2% in 2022. Preparing the ground for a showdown with government, the TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, told the Observer that public sector employees had worked during the pandemic “through the most intense days of their working lives”. She added: “We have been holding meetings of public sector workers with their MPs. Many of them were not able to hold the tears back as they spoke up about how hard it has been at work, and how hard it is at home trying to make ends meet. “The danger now for the whole nation is that we are at a tipping point. Many public sector workers across services like health, education and social care say they don’t know if they can take it any more. If they don’t at least get a proper pay rise and help to reduce workloads, it will be the final straw. A mass exodus would send shockwaves through every community, and it would damage our economy too. Ministers must be much more alive to this danger. They cannot let it happen.” Recommendations on public sector pay are made to ministers by independent pay review bodies (PRBs) which receive submissions from the unions and employers. Ministers set the remit of the PRBs and can accept or reject their recommendations. Union sources said it was crucial that ministers now acted to give the PRBs a clear steer that pay should have to keep pace with inflation to avoid a recruitment crisis. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the fact that the chancellor had announced no more money for public services in the spring statement “is almost bound to result in more hefty real pay cuts for nurses, teachers and other public sector workers”. He added: “That will come on top of a decade of cuts during which pay in the public sector has done even worse than that in the private sector. It looks like trouble ahead.” Unison general secretary Christina McAnea said: “If the government doesn’t deliver inflation-busting wage increases across the entire public sector, staff will exit for better-paid, less stressful jobs. That would leave services unable to cope. “Firms on the high street are paying more to keep and attract the staff they need. That’s what public services need to do too, but it’s the government holding the purse strings.” The latest Opinium poll for the Observer found 68% of people believe that ministers should be doing more to tackle the cost of living crisis while just 18% said they were doing all they could. Some 57% think the economy will worsen in the next 12 months, against 19% who believe it will improve; 49% believe their personal finances will worsen in the next 12 months against 14% who think they will get better. Dr Patrick Roach, the NASUWT general secretary, said: “Uncompetitive pay levels are contributing to a worsening picture on teacher supply. Data shows that by 2020, over 40% of those who had entered the teaching profession 10 years previously were no longer teaching. “Our 2022 teachers’ pay survey indicates that 70% of teachers have considered leaving their job in the last 12 months and that 49% of teachers indicated that their pay had a great deal or a lot of impact on their intention to leave the profession. “Adding to the pressure on teachers is the soaring cost of living, which is driving more and more into financial hardship. Our survey shows that two-thirds of teachers are ‘somewhat worried’ about their financial situation and 22% are ‘very worried’.”",News/Society,UK unions: pay better wages or expect a mass exodus of essential workers,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/27/uk-unions-pay-better-wages-or-expect-a-mass-exodus-of-essential-workers
3/27/2022,"The Conservative party’s conceit is that it is the country, speaks for the country and is the custodian of the country’s true values. The combination of a first-past-the-post voting system, a divided and often not very electable opposition and a pliant media certainly means it’s more often than not in government, so apparently warranting the conceit. But that does not mean that the conceit is justified. Britain is a much more innately progressive, generous and fair-minded country than our party of the right ever imagines. But for an ambitious Tory politician, the falseness of the equation does not matter. What counts is the goodwill of backbench MPs and constituency associations. Not only are they seen in the Tory tribal echo chamber as proxies for mainstream public opinion, they are the voters who will confer the party leadership and thus prime ministership. Have them on your side and the prime ministership is yours. So the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, must have thought as he prepared a spring budget whose hallmarks were fiscal deceit, political cynicism and an astounding lack of imagination. He presented himself as if in a tight spot, but in truth he was in anything but. The rise in forecast inflation to 7.2% and falling back only slowly thereafter, interacting with his pre-announced policy of freezing income-tax allowances and a stronger economic recovery than expected, means that borrowing will be an astounding £72bn lower over the next four years than he thought only last October. The forecast budget deficit in four years will be the lowest for 25 years. How was that largesse to be allocated? Serious choices were available, but Sunak took us for fools. He assumed that a 5p cut in fuel duty, lifting the threshold for national insurance contributions and the promise of a penny off the standard rate of income tax in 2024 would delude the public at large and his backbenchers in particular into thinking he was a tax-cutting chancellor. This, even as the wider tax take is rising to postwar highs. Having suckered them into thinking he was doing as much as possible within his artificially created constraints, with Tory MPs waving their order papers joyously, he could leave unaddressed, and with little protest, the coming biggest drop in household incomes for 66 years. It was deceit posing as virtue. This parade of his devotion to Thatcherite virtues of thrift, lowering debt and commitment to “fiscal responsibility” would, he hoped, further cement his reputation with his key constituency. Of course, those principles must mean he should hoard the £30bn of financial headroom with which he could have done more in this year alone. But every positive option was stubbornly refused. A down payment to get levelling up going seriously, to capture the prize of an economy £2.5tn bigger in a generation’s time? No chance – it wasn’t even mentioned. Lifting departments’ cash spending totals to compensate for higher inflation, so avoiding a repeat of George Osborne’s austerity? Forget it – and Sunak will be the arbiter of government policy until the election, as department after department will come pleading to him to restore the spending power they thought they had last October. Amazingly, even defence spending is to face a real-term cut in 2022-23. An uplift in universal credit or a promise to index benefits to compensate for higher inflation as families face real poverty? No way – these are the undeserving poor who hardly vote and if they do vote they don’t vote Tory. They can twist in the wind. All that mattered was to guard jealously that hoard, offer no support to the beleaguered prime minister in his flagship policy and no additional help to millions of households facing a further £800 jump in energy bills when the price cap is lifted in October. The money is earmarked for tax cuts in 2024, aiming to buy the Tories the election and Sunak the prime ministership. For brazen cynicism, I have witnessed nothing like it in more than 40 years of commenting on budgets. Worse, tax cuts have been elevated to become the alpha and omega of policy – a standing they don’t deserve in theory or practice. Plenty of high-tax economies perform very well. What drives growth is ideas, access to open and growing markets, well-run companies, fit-for-purpose institutions, trained workers, smart, long-term finance, inspirational leaders and clever, innovative government not obsessed by capping debt. Most of this the government is simply not capable of doing systematically or even of grasping intellectually. Putting some muscle behind levelling up or driving to net zero could be catalytic, but neither is owned by Sunak or the party at large. Indeed, in key areas, we are going backwards. The Office for Budget Responsibility delivered a scathing verdict on how Brexit has induced a collapse in our exports to and imports from the EU. It calculates that trade’s share in UK GDP has fallen 12% since 2019 – two-and-half times more than any other G7 country. Brexit is the cause, not remotely compensated for by any of the much-vaunted trade deals outside the EU. Falling trade is a drag on growth – and weakens firms’ inducement to raise productivity. Bad and bad, although the reign of silence on Brexit – and that very much includes you, Labour party – means that the damage goes unnoticed and uncriticised. We are governed by uncreative over-claimers obsessed by Thatcherite shibboleths – hating Europe, fetishising tax cuts and “fiscal responsibility” and wilfully careless of the condition of the people. Sunak’s disastrous spring budget was a seismic event, but he was only making choices faithful to the conceit that the Tories’ priorities and values are those of the country. The near-universally hostile reaction was testimony to just how out of touch this narrow tribe has become. Britain is not aching for tax cuts or everlasting enmity with Europe. It wants a government that has its back and understands its instincts for fairness and wants to see a creative framework that will stimulate growth and living standards. The message from last week is unambiguous. These Conservatives have run out of ideas and road. Our stricken society and failing economy need so much more.

3/27/2022,"Among the performances vying for shiny gongs at Sunday’s Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles, there are a special few who have somehow escaped all the bright lights and hoopla. A handful of female stars have quietly made a spectacular job of playing unconventional roles in unusual films that have not hit the headlines, nor even drawn great crowds to the cinema. Kristen Stewart is nominated for playing Diana, Princess of Wales in the little-discussed, daring Spencer, while a favourite to beat her is Jessica Chastain, cast as the extravagant American television evangelist in The Eyes of Tammy Faye. But there is another Jessica, Ireland’s own Jessie Buckley, who also has a good chance of walking away with a golden statuette on Sunday. Her portrayal of a discontented young mother in The Lost Daughter, nominated in the best supporting actress category, has been hailed by critics as a crucial and mesmeric component of Maggie Gyllenhaal’s disturbing film. Observer film critic Wendy Ide is among those who believes Buckley deserves serious Oscar consideration for a performance that “once again demonstrates that she is one of the most exciting actors of her generation”. Quiet though Buckley’s performance may be, the Oscar ceremony’s glittering and raucous fuss will mark an extraordinary blossoming of her career. The 32-year-old from a big, unpretentious family in County Kerry is now increasingly in demand both on stage and in front of the camera. Theatre and film directors are clearly drawn to working with a star who has such a beguilingly off-centre charisma. It seems an effortless quality and is especially valuable in an actor who can also communicate high-voltage emotion. In The Lost Daughter, Gyllenhaal’s uncomfortable look at the paralysing challenges of motherhood, Buckley plays the younger Leda, a character played in later life by Olivia Colman. Playing opposite Buckley in her flashback scenes is Jack Farthing, who was already a friend. Now, after working together, Farthing is also a big fan of her talent. “I could write a book of nice things about her,” he said this weekend. “She just brought so much love and truth and commitment to that film. She is an extraordinary actor. Instinctive, authentic and free: the kind that elevates your own work immediately, and teases out the same openness and vulnerability that she brings.” If Buckley fails to claim her Oscar this time – if it goes instead to the Bafta-winning Ariana DeBose for her startling turn in West Side Story – all Buckley will need is patience. After all, it has worked for her before. In 2008, she was the “nearly girl” in a very public way when she was runner-up to Jodie Prenger in the BBC television talent show I’d Do Anything. The series was designed to pluck out an unknown to play the role of Nancy in a London production of Lionel Bart’s stage musical Oliver!. Impressing the judges, who included Denise van Outen and Barry Humphries, Buckley was eventually pipped to the post when the results of the viewers’ vote came in. How sweet it must be now then for the actor to finally be hailed as a West End star after her recent performance as Sally Bowles in the musical Cabaret. For Susannah Clapp, the Observer’s theatre critic, Buckley’s supreme skill was in making each of her songs “an individual drama” – so much so that she appeared to “have written them herself”. For the Financial Times’s critic, Buckley’s “raw, desolate, defiant” Bowles was “career-defining”. Her rendition of the famous title song, the review continued, “rips away all expectations of cheery resilience” and was “like watching someone break down before you”. The journey from rejection to such acclaim has been tough. Buckley, she has said, had only applied to take part in the talent show on the rebound after failing to get a place at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. When Prenger, rather than her, was given the role of Nancy, she stepped back into the shadows and took a range of jobs, working as a shop assistant and as a jazz singer at the swish Mayfair nightclub Annabel’s in order to stay in London. Her family back in Ireland were not worried, she has said. Her mother, Marina, a vocal coach, and her father, Tim, were just pleased to have more space in the house. “Oh Jesus, they were delighted – there are five of us, after all, so it was more: ‘Thank God one’s left the home.’ “They were incredibly supportive. They always told all of us not to be afraid because even if you’re standing on the edge of a cliff, at least you’re experiencing something.” Buckley’s decision to audition for drama school once again, this time for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, took courage, but it paid off: “I’d had to grow up pretty quickly and going back to drama school gave me a chance to be with people my own age and do normal things, like going to a pub on a Friday night and just hanging out.” The Buckley path to fame built steadily from there. TV audiences will perhaps have first recognised her face from the BBC One drama Taboo, where she starred opposite Tom Hardy as the widow Lorna Bow. (“I absolutely loved playing that character,” she has said, “because she had her own ambition and gave as good as she got.”) Or possibly in Peter Moffat’s The Last Post, where she was cast as a young army wife posted to Aden in the mid-1960s. Or they may have admired her in an adaptation of Wilkie Collins’s tale The Woman in White. But it was in the 2016 big-budget television serialisation of Tolstoy’s War and Peace, in a lineup of young talent that included Lily James, Tuppence Middleton and James Norton, that Buckley’s slow-burn presence really gave off some heat. She played Marya Bolkonskaya, the calm, wise soul who for some is the moral centre of the novel. Two important relationships were the legacy of the acclaimed series. Buckley went on to star in her breakthrough film, Wild Rose, with War and Peace’s director, Tom Harper, and she also became Norton’s partner for a couple of years. Observer film critic Mark Kermode, who had admired her “electrifying” performance in the Channel Islands-set thriller Beast, was one of many delighted to see her in the lead role of “firebrand” and hopeful country singer Rose-Lynn Harlan in Harper’s film. Her portrayal, as the headstrong, cowboy boot-wearing daughter of Julie Walters’s Marion, reaches “out from the screen and grabs the audience by the throat”, Kermode wrote, adding: “Brilliantly, she manages simultaneously to convey both boisterous confidence and searing self-doubt, rooting her character’s chin-forward recklessness in an underlying sense of confusion about her purpose and destiny.” Those who were slower to catch the Buckley habit will surely have begun to recognise her face when she appeared as a distraught wife in the terrifying drama series Chernobyl. In this grim role, inevitably, there was little sign of Buckley’s customary lopsided grin, but her pain seemed all too real. For Buckley connoisseurs, performances to savour include the dry humour of the lead role in Charlie Kaufman’s 2020 film I’m Thinking of Ending Things, in which she plays opposite Jesse Plemons, who has also been recognised on Sunday with a best supporting actor Oscar nomination for his role as Benedict Cumberbatch’s kinder brother in The Power of the Dog. And, again almost under the radar, Buckley wowed many British theatre critics during lockdown with her stage portrayal of the most famous young heroine of them all, Juliet in Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. With Josh O’Connor cast as Romeo in a filmed-for-television National Theatre production, Buckley persuaded seasoned Observer critic Clapp that she was one of the better Juliets she has ever watched. She wrote: “Jessie Buckley is completely absorbed and absorbing, prophetically fearful (her ‘fiery-footed steeds’ sound as if they are dragging a hearse), laying her soul as bare as her makeup-free face.” Whether or not that Oscar ends up in Irish arms tonight, the sensible money still says the award will land there before too many more years have passed.",Arts/Culture,From reality TV to Oscar nominee: the rise and rise of Jessie Buckley,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/27/from-reality-tv-to-oscar-nominee-the-rise-and-rise-of-jessie-buckley-lost-daughter
3/27/2022,"My Covid-postponed standup tour continues. Another Thursday morning; another hotel room; another opportunity to purloin branded shower caps and shoe-mitts that I will never use, yet which signify an indefinable victory over normal life, from which I appear to have fatally exempted my nomadic self. My stolen mini shampoo bottle supply will outlast my hair. Is this a win? Is anyone impressed? Once more, I have the privilege of wrenching another thousand words out of another week of the same unchanging Tory lies and incompetence. It’s like Groundhog Day, Boris Johnson a fat, ceremonial rodent driven only by instinct, cunning and desire. Turds emerges each week from the prime minister’s questions burrow, blinking in the bright light of cold, hard facts, his corruption and dishonesty apparently unaccountable as the faithful cheer and the unconvinced stare on in nauseated disbelief. Ever get the feeling you’ve been cheated? But somebody at central office sensed that, on some level, it might be expedient for the damaged Turds to put some distance between himself and last week’s bad news. As the already Covid-crushed and Brexit-battered British public face the biggest economic hit since rationing, Rishi Sunak remains a non-corporeal digital duct for artfully airbrushed disappointments. The chancellor exists in a glossy slipstream of cynically staged publicity photos that place him at the exact centre of an imagined middle England of inconspicuous consumption and shared Sainsbury’s values. Sunak is one shutter-snap short of being posed on a Ricky Gervais’s commemorative After Life park bench, secretly snaffling an entire Colin the Caterpillar while wondering if the National Trust is now “a bit too woke”, the ultimate embodiment of our current collective shared national values. On Wednesday, having cut a meaningless 5p from fuel duty, Sunak was systematically positioned and photographed – the poseable, single-mum-starving Ken Doll of the Downing Street Instagram account – by a government propagandist at a New Cross petrol station. Sunak fills up his calculatedly inoffensive Kia car (which, it later emerged, isn’t his car at all), making small talk with another motorist, shirt sleeves rolled up, artisanal wristbands offsetting sharp trousers, a Sainsbury’s storefront visible behind him, bland to the point where his uncomprehending and ignorant cruelty is almost invisible, as if smothered by a wall of ready-framed prints of Lake District jetties and umbrella-twirling lovers that his own home would never play host to. On Wednesday lunchtime in parliament, Sunak balanced his £180 “smart” coffee mug on the halo of flies surrounding Priti Patel’s head, swallowed down his integrity and his empathy and announced that leaving the EU meant he was able to abolish VAT on insulating materials. I smelled a rat, unsurprisingly, as we are never more than six feet away from one and rats really stink. But nonetheless, I thought, “I bet it’s more complicated than that”. And, of course, a swift Google revealed that EU finance ministers had already announced an EU-wide exemption on VAT for green products on 8 December last year. Similarly, the myth that the vaccine was only developed because we left the EU persists, sustained by Turds’s ability to cite it in answer to any difficult question. “Did you attend the bacchanalian revels of a KGB agent’s son, whom you later ennobled, having given your Foreign Office handlers the slip?” “The vaccine rollout was only possible because we left the EU.” Repeat to fade. Sunak says the incoming economic crisis is the fault of a global conflict it actually predates, suggesting a mismanagement of the national purse so acute it has actually destroyed the laws of physics and enabled debts to travel back through time, like the Avengers in Endgame. Of course, the acknowledged long-term hit to GDP from Brexit, identified by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, doesn’t get a look in, despite Jacob Rees-Mogg’s promises of cheaper food and cheaper footwear. Stamp on a pigeon in a £5 pair of slip-on shoes and maybe you’ll have something nice to spit-roast for your dinner! If you can’t afford the gas required to bake a potato, you can at least roast your flying vermin over some burning pallets. David Davies’s once-ridiculed post-Brexit Mad Max dystopia is here ahead of schedule! And while the rest of us, doing the right thing by Ukraine, will feel the hit to our pockets from sanctions and shortages, the Indian tech company Sunak’s wife has a £430m stake in continues to operate in Moscow, despite his government’s calls for disinvestment. The wealth that sustains Sunak’s own £180 smart mug supply is in no immediate danger, no matter how long the war in the east continues. Sunak’s smart heated travel mug allows him to set an exact drinking temperature for up to three hours, so his coffee is never too hot or too cold. It is always just right. Why does anyone even bother fact-checking anything the Brexit government say about the benefits of Brexit? Just save time by assuming everything Johnson and his henchmen say is lies and get on with your day. The rest of the world already has. Ukraine’s clearly exasperated former president Petro Poroshenko stands in combat fatigues in a bombed-out city and asks Johnson not to compare Brexit to his country’s fight against Russia, as if explaining the world to a stupid lying child. Once I have filed this column, I will walk in to Nottingham town for my daily exercise. In Brian Clough Square, just along from the lace museum and the newly minted statue of Sleaford Mods, there is a 100 foot-high mural of local hero Robin Hood, tossing requisitioned rich man’s gold to a waiting crowd of starving peasants, a foundation myth of our nation that speaks, I think, to an enduring sense of fair play. But who is that in the background, glimpsed through the greenwood, filling up his Kia car while supping perfectly warmed coffee from his £180 smart mug and calculating those Russian dividends? Can it be the Sheriff of Nottingham?

3/27/2022,"The rock autobiography is typically a male genre, telling tales of excess so competitive that readers could be forgiven for wishing Keith Richards, Neil Young, Roger Daltrey, et al, would break the monotony by taking up wood whittling. But now comes Martha Wainwright, whose autobiography, published this week, is a female-gaze account of what it takes to juggle relationships, familial and domestic circumstances with life under the stage lights. Speaking to the Observer last week, Wainwright recalled that while working her way through Young’s biography, Waging Heavy Peace, she felt that none of the stories would be happening without the wealth that came from decades of rock success. Paraphrasing her fellow Canadian-American singer-songwriter’s account, she says: “I went down in my incredible car, popped over to Honolulu, went over here, got some wood from the floors of the Algonquin room and put it on the side of my beautiful schooner yacht.” “That’s charming, but [mine] is not a rock biography,” she said. “It’s a woman’s story about a modern family and these things people have gone through – termination of pregnancies, separation and divorce, relationships with siblings, dealing with children, and trying to figure out how to get by and, as an artist, where I chalk up in the tower of songs.” Wainwright, a mother of two, speaks for thousands of working mothers when she describes the tension of balancing work and home. The daughter of the folk singers Loudon Wainwright III and Kate McGarrigle, she recalls her father saying to her mother, who died in 2010 at 63, “the baby or me, or else the baby and the career, but not all three”. The words “really fucked with” her mother, said Wainwright. “It was important for me to say it, because she talked about it. She, like myself, already felt bad enough leaving our kids for weeks at a time to go to places – where people kind of go, ‘Yeah? You’re gonna do that?’ ‘Well, yeah, I gotta feed them.’ We’re easy targets.” Wainwright was talking while spreading Marmite on toast in her Québécoise kitchen. “I used to put a little on, now I put a lot on,” she allowed. Like many things, it’s a habit that gets stronger. That could be said to apply to her honesty. Spread around her, she said, was a post-pandemic pile of bills and tax demands. “I’m starting to see and feel the damage done over the last couple of years. I’ve got a lot more wrinkles on my face, the house is an incredible mess, there’s nothing in the bank account, a lot of bad decisions were made, and I’m, like, what happened?” It took Wainwright, 45, seven years to write Stories I Might Regret Telling You, and we learn from this tender personal survey what it is to be the stray lamb of a folk-pop dynasty. Across four decades, the Wainwrights and McGarrigles – Loudon, Kate, their two children, Rufus and Martha, and aunt Anna – have sung singularly or together for fans, as well as with fellow travellers from Linda Ronstadt to Nick Cave, who asked her mother and aunt to join the Bad Seeds. But Covid gave her time, Wainwright said, to extricate herself from her story. It began with a devastating single, Bloody Mother Fucking Asshole, about her father. “I’ve been talking about my family since for ever, and families are interesting but, by putting it down on the page, I’ve maybe freed myself of it,” she said. “I’m letting some things stay in the past, and looking to create a new story, with new love and a new family with my own children.” Clearing the decks comes with an opening-page punch: her father pressuring her mother to have an abortion. “I had always felt a little out of place in the world, and knowing I’d only just barely made the cut didn’t help any,” she writes. Her musical inheritance wasn’t as daunting as it can be for some rock spawn. “Rock often comes with grandiosity. I come from folk, I still sing with my brother, and there’s goodwill in my family. We always had to sing together, and show up for each other, so there’s a mutual appreciation among the annoyances.” Next week, Wainwright will be in New York to celebrate the life of the music producer Hal Willner, who died in the early days of the pandemic. It will be a coming together of the people that he touched. Likely as not, the sound of harmonising voices will be the bond that holds the event together. “When everybody is civil and kind, and that impulse is creative and upheld by a harmony in the voice. That probably goes to singing with your community, going to church or singing with your neighbour. You don’t turn to them afterwards and punch them in the face. “It’s one of the reasons we sing,” Wainwright mused. “Certainly, it’s the glue that’s held this family together.”",Arts/Music,"Martha Wainwright: ‘Forget rock excess, life on the road was a juggling act for me’",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/27/martha-wainwright-forget-rock-excess-life-on-the-road-was-a-juggling-act-for-me
3/27/2022,"As vaccine makers seek authorization for a fourth dose of their Covid vaccines in America, existing delays with vaccination and a lack of federal funding could slow the next booster rollout across the country, experts say. “We’re way behind the eight-ball,” said Eric Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute. The rollout of the first round of boosters, authorized in the US last fall, “just fell off the cliff”, with many Americans still not realizing they are eligible or that the booster is recommended. With a potential second booster on the horizon for vulnerable groups, the Biden administration is still struggling to drum up American public interest in additional shots – and funding from Congress to pay for Covid initiatives. “We’re out of money pretty much for the pandemic spending, which is terrifying because we don’t know what’s coming around the corner,” said Katrine Wallace, an epidemiologist at the University of Illinois Chicago. Pfizer-BioNtech asked the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 15 March for another round of boosters for those 65 and up, while Moderna went a step further and asked on 17 March for more boosters among those 18 and up to give the FDA “flexibility” in considering who would benefit from additional shots, including vulnerable younger people, the company said. The doses in question would be the original formulation of the vaccines. Omicron-specific vaccines are still in the trial phase, but scientists believe updating the vaccines as the virus evolves could broaden immune responses to future variants. A $15bn funding package for testing, treatment, vaccines and more was cut unexpectedly from an omnibus spending bill in Congress on 9 March. Health officials spoke to Democratic senators about the urgent need for Covid funding in a meeting on Wednesday, Politico reports, but the plan may meet with opposition: Republicans, who were not at the meeting, say the White House’s $22.5bn request must be accompanied with equal cuts to government spending elsewhere. There is enough funding to give fourth doses of the vaccines to immunocompromised people, who already qualify for the shots, and for those over 65, if the shot is authorized for them in coming weeks, the coronavirus response coordinator, Jeff Zients, said at a White House briefing on Wednesday. But wider booster campaigns would not have funding under the current budget shortfalls, and first- and second-shot campaigns could also be affected in the longer term. The funding collapse may also affect future research on updated vaccines and treatments. “Maybe we will see a new variant that’s escaped all of these, and we need a new vaccine,” Wallace said. Without funding to create and then distribute the updated vaccines, “that is going to be an issue”. Three doses were on average 94% effective against needing mechanical ventilation or dying during the Omicron surge, according to research from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published on Friday. That kind of effectiveness is “a miracle”, Topol said. “That’s incredible, but that’s never been conveyed to the public – it’s amazing to me.” “If we had a chemo that would do that for cancer – increase the odds of survival by that much – everybody with cancer would want to get it,” Wallace said. Yet only about 29% of the US population has been boosted. Less than half (44%) of all Americans who received their initial shots continued in the series, although that figure is higher (67%) in those aged 65 and older. “There was a huge push to get people fully vaccinated, which was the two doses, but not as big of a push for the booster,” Wallace said. “A lot of people just don’t understand that the booster is now available to everybody.” When the boosters were first rolled out, they were limited to certain populations, including older and immune-compromised Americans as well as health workers, before they were opened to all adults and eventually to children 12 and up. “There was mass confusion, and that’s why the uptake is so poor,” Topol said. Some populations – including older Americans and health workers – received their first boosters last fall, raising concerns about waning efficacy among those who are most at-risk of getting or becoming very sick from the virus. The effectiveness of the third dose at preventing hospitalization wanes to 78% four months after the booster, according to another recent CDC report. In a recent study from Israel, a fourth mRNA dose increased antibody levels and protected against infection slightly better. The members of the FDA’s independent advisory committee will meet on 6 April to discuss booster authorization policies moving forward, especially in the light of new and emerging variants. No vote is scheduled for the advisers’ meeting, which will focus on a framework for boosters rather than specific applications for authorization. The CDC recommends that everyone 12 and up who received two doses of an mRNA vaccine or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine should also receive a booster dose two or five months later, depending on the vaccine. Immunocompromised people – including those undergoing treatment for cancer, organ transplant recipients, people living with HIV, and patients regularly taking immune-suppressing drugs like corticosteroids – already qualify for a fourth dose, because they may not mount a strong or lasting response to the initial three shots. Roughly 2.7% of Americans, or about 9 million people, are immunocompromised. Officials also need to step up efforts to vaccinate those who aren’t fully vaccinated, representing about one-third of the US population. “We need to somehow try to make inroads in that group, because it’s big,” Wallace said. And vaccinating the rest of the world is key for ending surges of the virus and the emergence of new variants globally. These three groups – the immunocompromised, those over 65, and those who haven’t been vaccinated – should take priority before others receive fourth doses, Wallace said. The US is likely to see another wave of Covid and vaccines can take weeks to become fully effective, making vaccination campaigns urgent now, experts said. “It is good that there’s a lull in circulating virus – that’s wonderful,” Topol said. “This is the time to get protected for the next wave, of which there will be one or two or more – but that hasn’t been conveyed. “People have been lulled into a zone of complacency, which is unfortunate,” Topol said. “It’s understandable after all the fatigue, and everyone is so sick of this, but it’s not what’s in the cards, and we need to prepare, defend and protect people.”",News/US news,‘We’re way behind’: next US booster rollout faces delays and lack of funds,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/27/us-second-covid-booster-delays-funding
3/27/2022,"“Ifeel a strange sense of deja vu,” I blurted out in the splendour of the wood-panelled parliamentary committee room with its battle-scene oil paintings and creepy portraits of the great and the good of past ages with eyes that almost follow you round the room. “Sorry that it’s Groundhog Day,” Orlando Fraser QC, the subject of our MPs’ inquiry, shot back, playing his part in the masquerade but also genuinely apologetic. We were there as digital, culture, media and sport select committee members in a pre-appointment hearing to scrutinise the government’s choice for the plum post of the nation’s charity commissioner. Nice work if you can get it; barely a couple of days work a week with a cool five-figure remuneration. And yet those who land these posts are the same-old same-old. This week, the one up before us will be Lord Grade, the 79-year-old Tory peer fingered as chair of Ofcom. The government picks them. Then the committee gets a token grilling before they metamorphose Doctor Who style from the last post-holder, who tends to be knighted if they weren’t already decorated. Even when we recommend a “no”, as in the case of Lady Stowell, whose Charity Commission tenure has now ended and was by all accounts disastrous (predictable when people are picked for loyalty not ability), they get the gig anyway. “If I am appointed,” Fraser interspersed between responses, knowing full well he will be. It was deja vu at last Thursday’s hearing because only in January another white bloke in a suit had been the chosen one before the same committee but that lucky winner resigned before even starting, after bullying allegations against him emerged. The government commented on a disappointing number of women and BAME applicants, then plumped for second best rather than re-advertising somewhere these underrepresented categories (the board itself has double the blokes it has women) might notice. Something has seriously gone wrong when people on boards spring from such a narrow gene pool. There is a distinct pattern to appointees. Fraser (son of Lady Antonia and a Tory MP) protested that his political leanings should not be presumed, as he was a young man when he stood as an unsuccessful Conservative candidate in 2005 and his grandfather had been a Labour peer, I felt rather landing himself in it. He dismissed his comments on Devon girls being ugly as another youthful indiscretion but by my maths he was 37. Then there’s the Conservative scourge of wokism and the BBC licence fee in the House of Lords, Michael Grade, son of Lew. And the government-installed BBC director-general, Tim Davie, another failed Conservative parliamentary candidate. The ability to exercise neutrality and objectivity in these roles is trumped by feeding the desires of Nadine Dorries and Oliver Dowden’s imagined war on the woke. And when people say Labour did the same too, we can’t avoid the lack of diversity in an appointments process that throws up the same-old same-old in a depressing treadmill of chumocracy and where the toothless select committee pre-appointment interview is expected to merely rubber-stamp these “great and good”. It was deja vu also as on committees past, I’ve questioned the likes of the chief inspector of prisons who could not recall when he’d last set foot in a prison but was well versed in going from board to board.

3/27/2022,"Transport officials have cut funding to three Conservative-controlled councils for failing to encourage walking and cycling amid a local Tory backlash against government-backed plans to reduce traffic and pollution. The Department for Transport (DfT) has been forced to reduce active travel funding to a string of councils after Tory councillors removed pop-up cycle lanes and pedestrianised areas before they had a chance to change the way people travel. The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead did not receive any funding to draw up cycling and walking infrastructure plans last year after it abandoned proposals for two low-traffic neighbourhoods. This month the Tory-run borough announced it was removing pavement widening measures on eight streets, partly to increase car parking bays. In a town forum discussing the removal, a council officer declared the “car remains king” in Maidenhead. Martin Richardson, who cycles with his son in the borough, said many felt it was too busy to cycle even short distances. “People feel frightened,” he said. “It is not inviting for families [to cycle] because there is no protection.” West Sussex county council was refused more active travel funding after it ripped out a popular cycle lane in Shoreham-by-Sea, which linked five schools and had been used for 30,000 cycle trips, within weeks of its installation in 2020. Leicestershire county council, which has removed pop-up cycle lanes , also lost funding. One non-Tory council, Brighton and Hove, had funding withheld after Conservative and Labour councillors outvoted a minority Green party administration to take down a temporary cycle lane connecting schools and workplaces, despite a report warning removal would negatively impact safety and the environment. The government’s active travel strategy states funding will be stopped if councils are “not taking active travel seriously” including removing “schemes prematurely”. A DfT spokesperson said: “We have consistently made clear to local authorities that they must deliver good quality active travel schemes, to ensure our roads work for everyone – or funding will be withheld.” Cycling UK said it was concerned too many councils were removing schemes prematurely. “Survey after survey shows active travel measures are actually popular but councillors and MPs are listening to a noisy minority and a misinformation campaign by parts of the media,” said Duncan Dollimore from the charity. The councils of Windsor and Maidenhead, and Leicestershire both said they were committed to developing cycling and walking plans. West Sussex said it was delivering permanent walking and cycling improvements across the county.",News/Politics,Get on your bike?

3/27/2022,"Concerns are growing over the government’s plan to install Conservative peer Michael Grade as the next chair of media regulator Ofcom, amid questions over his impartiality and past business record. Grade faces a pre-appointment hearing in front of the Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee of MPs this week before finally being approved for the role. MPs on the committee are understood to have concerns about the 79-year-old’s suitability to oversee the regulator. The selection of Grade, who has led the BBC, ITV and Channel 4, came after a protracted battle to install the former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre in the job. Dacre was initially rejected as “unappointable” by a selection panel. Ministers then reran the process, before Dacre pulled out. While Grade’s appointment has been cleared by a selection panel, industry figures and MPs are now raising concerns. Just last month, Grade defended Boris Johnson over the “partygate” row and said there should not be a leadership election. He criticised the BBC’s approach to reporting the story as “gleeful and disrespectful”, as well as “too aggressive”. He also said that the BBC’s request for funds to avoid cuts was “an appalling decision”. Grade has criticised “the woke brigade” and spoken favourably about the potential privatisation of Channel 4. One senior Tory MP privately expressed concerns about Grade’s impartiality. “He has very public views on a number of issues that Ofcom should be neutral on,” they said. When chairing the Fundraising Regulator, he was criticised after he referred to some fundraisers as “cowboys” operating in the “wild west”. Meanwhile, others pointed to issues that have arisen in his career since he left Channel 4, and effectively left broadcasting, in 1997. Grade has been attached to a series of failed businesses since then. In 2020, Gate Ventures, an entertainment investment company that he chaired, entered administration after a legal battle with an investor who claimed the company was being mismanaged. The company also made “unexplained” business and personal loans to the Duchess of York of more than £500,000. The high court was told this included a loan to her personally of about £288,000. Grade was forced to appear in court in person after lawyers for Gate Ventures quit at short notice over payment concerns. In the 2000s, he chaired financial information company Hemscott, which was fined by the Financial Services Authority over misleading advertising. One industry insider with knowledge of Ofcom’s day-to-day workings said that the chair’s role was one that required a great deal of time on legal issues, to which Grade was not suited. Another senior figure said: “To be chair of Ofcom, you really also need a legal brain. That takes up so much of the time. That’s not Michael’s thing.” Grade faces an intense grilling on Thursday. Julian Knight, the DCMS committee’s Tory chair, has already described the process of finding an appropriate Ofcom chief as a “shambles”. Grade will be overseeing Ofcom at a crucial time, with the regulator due to be given significant power over online platforms such as Facebook. It also comes with ministers accused of making a series of politically partisan appointments to major institutions. The Ofcom chairmanship is a three-day-a-week role. Rupa Huq, a Labour member of the culture committee, said something had “seriously gone wrong” with the public appointments process. She said that Grade’s appointment was part of a “war on woke” by the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, and the Tory co-chairman, Oliver Dowden. “The parachuting of yet another top Tory crony to a leading position in public life where government loyalty appears to have been paramount in selection criteria is deeply troubling and part of a disturbing pattern,” she said. Jamie Stone, the Liberal Democrat culture spokesperson, said: “Appointing this well-known critic of the BBC and Channel 4 shows that the Conservatives are trying to muzzle our treasured national broadcasters. At a time when Ofcom is being given huge new powers to police online platforms, Michael Grade would be an analogue chair in a digital age. MPs should fiercely oppose this political stitch-up and insist on a candidate who will protect our independent and impartial broadcasters, not do the government’s dirty work for them.” Grade was contacted for comment, but did not respond. It is understood he will relinquish any non-executive directorships that could create a conflict of interest. He will also sit as a crossbench peer once installed in the job.",News/Media,Michael Grade faces tough questions over fitness to lead Ofcom,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/27/michael-grade-faces-tough-questions-over-fitness-to-lead-ofcom
3/27/2022,"When Vladmir Putin rolled the dice of war just over a month ago, he was not alone in thinking that his imperial enterprise was a dead cert. More than a few senior figures in the British and other western governments shared his assumption that Russian forces possessed the numerical and technological superiority to prevail, and swiftly. It was widely thought that by now we would be looking at a subjugated Ukraine while a triumphant Putin taunted the west to do anything about it. Belligerent autocrats the world over would have been encouraged to believe that tomorrow belongs to dictatorships and the liberal democracies would never have looked so feeble. The decline of the west would no longer be a contentious draft of the history of the early 21st century. It would be more like a bitter fact. So when the leaders of Nato, the EU and the G7 recently gathered in Brussels, one of the strongest emotions was sheer relief that the Russian invasion has not gone to Putin’s plan. Only a minority of the credit for that belongs to western leaders, too many of whom were slow to supply the Ukrainians with the means to defend themselves and some of whom are still not rising to the gravity of the moment. The failure of Putin’s gamble is down to Russian military incompetence making contact with heroic, fierce and skilful Ukrainian resistance. In the early days of the conflict, the White House thought it so unlikely that Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s government could survive that it offered an escape route to save him from capture by the Russians. His response was the magnificently scornful “I need ammunition, not a ride”. The inspirational example of the Ukrainian leader and his defiant people has played a vital role in rallying and unifying the west. Another big factor is guilt. There is necessary shame among the democracies that Putin was emboldened to invade by the puny responses to his earlier aggressions. It wasn’t wrong to encourage Ukraine’s aspirations to join Nato. The mistake was not to satisfy them. That left Ukraine stranded in a dangerously ambiguous place, called “one of us” by the west but denied the protection of Nato’s nuclear umbrella, an exposed position that did not contain Russian aggression but amplified it. Along with the spasms of guilt and gasps of relief, there is also self-congratulation in western capitals that the democracies are displaying a resolve many doubted they could muster. Nato’s eastern flank is being reinforced. Finland and Sweden are debating whether to join the alliance, a window of opportunity they might be wise to leap through while Putin is preoccupied. Georgia and Moldova have applied to join the EU, which has managed to park some of its internal quarrels to concentrate on the external threat. The Swiss have put aside their neutrality to join the freezing of Russian assets. Even the ineffable silliness of Boris Johnson, who just couldn’t stop himself making a tasteless and ludicrous comparison between Brexit and Ukraine’s mortal struggle for freedom, hasn’t spoilt the mood. The most remarkable sight has been to witness Germany waking from its long slumber. During the Nato operation to prevent ethnic cleansing by the Serbian dictator Slobodan Milošević in the late 1990s, Gerhard Schröder told Tony Blair that Germany would never participate in military action because his country had become “essentially pacifist”. No longer. Under Olaf Scholz, Europe’s mightiest economic power has committed itself to a huge programme of rearmament – and pollsters report that three-quarters of the German public embrace the ambition. Yet question marks still hover over the democracies and their commitment to ensuring that Putin is defeated. The most pressing is about the scope and scale of the resources that Nato is prepared to commit to the defence of freedom. On this subject, President Zelenskiy is too eloquent for the comfort of many western leaders. When he addressed the Nato summit, he made a characteristically passionate appeal for “military assistance – without restrictions”, asking for the alliance to supply a tiny fraction of its military hardware: “You can give us 1% of your planes, 1% of your tanks.” This tugged on a significant rift between Nato members and within Nato governments. Some, notably the Americans and the French, are happy for the Ukrainians to receive defensive weaponry, such as anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles, but balk at warplanes and armour. They fear travelling a road that might lead towards escalation and even Armageddon. Sources report that Joe Biden personally nixed Poland’s proposal to reinforce the Ukrainians with MiG-29 fighters. This restraint has the sympathy of some senior Tories, including the former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt. He tells me: “The truth is we do have to stop ourselves getting sucked into an all-out war between Russia and Nato, because we have no idea how that might end.” Others contend that an excess of caution is handing Putin an advantage that he can and should be denied. Tobias Ellwood, the former soldier who chairs the Commons select committee on defence, argues that it is militarily and morally wrong to “leave the Ukrainians to do all the heavy lifting by themselves” while Nato’s “colossal firepower” is left “sitting on the bench”. The longer the war goes on – and especially if disgusted western voters put more pressure on their governments to respond to Russian war crimes – the more heated this argument will become. Russia is now a pariah state with a siege economy. Sanctions are hurting, but Putin is not being punished as severely as he could be, because western countries are still buying his hydrocarbons. Russia is banking $700m a day from European states for natural gas alone. This keeps the Kremlin solvent, finances its war machine and will be interpreted in Moscow as a sign that the west is not as fully committed to the fight for freedom as it claims to be. The selfish case for not imposing a comprehensive ban on Russian exports is that it will inflict discomfort on western consumers until alternative energy sources are available. The tactical case is that this sanction is a big bazooka best kept in reserve to deter Putin from an escalation of atrocities, such as using chemical or biological weapons. We know from his indiscriminate blitzing of major cities that he is utterly indifferent to the slaughter of civilians. Like Macbeth, he may tell himself “I am in blood stepped in so far that should I wade no more, returning were as tedious as go o’er”. He has already committed so much murder that his next gamble may be that he has nothing to lose from perpetrating even fouler acts. Should that happen, there will be an unanswerable case for tightening the economic blockade of Russia to maximum. Confronted with so much loss and devastation, it is natural to try to find solace in optimistic conjectures about how this war could end. This has been encouraged by battlefield deaths of senior Russian officers, the disappearance of key figures around Putin and reports of mutiny in his army’s ranks. The hope is that casualties and demoralisation on the Russian side will mount to the point that Putin is compelled to call it quits, withdraw his forces and try to dress up humiliation as some kind of victory. The dreamiest “dream scenario” is a putsch in Moscow. Putin contracts what was known in the cold war era as “Kremlin flu”. He goes away and never comes back – unless it is to face a war crimes trial at The Hague. Western governments do discuss the chances of a Kremlin coup. “It’s not impossible,” says Sir David Lidington, the former deputy prime minister and now chairman of the Royal United Services Institute. Russia has often surprised us. Western intelligence agencies didn’t anticipate the toppling of Nikita Krushchev in the wake of the Cuban missile crisis or the coup against Mikhail Gorbachev that triggered the collapse of the Soviet Union. We cannot entirely rule out the dethroning of Putin. But, as Sir David also says, nor should we be counting on it. It will be a major error to overinvest in scenarios that may turn out to be false. Western governments can hope for the best, but they must prepare themselves and their peoples for a protracted and testing conflict. Liberal democracy will not endure unless there is the stamina and the grit to battle for it. Whatever the cost of defending freedom to us, it will be as nothing compared to the sacrifices being asked of the courageous people of Ukraine.

3/27/2022,"Bridgerton NetflixSkint BBC Four | iPlayerThen Barbara Met Alan BBC Two | iPlayerThe Simpler Life Channel 4 | All 4 It’s obvious why some shameless types will be here for a Bridgerton second series review, so let’s get straight on to the sex quotient. In the opener, this series’ central character, Viscount Anthony Bridgerton (Jonathan Bailey), reveals his naked posterior. In ensuing episodes (all on Netflix), there is much feral flirting between him and Kate (Simone Ashley), sister of Edwina (Charithra Chandran), whom he is courting. Anthony also has a “wet shirt” moment, but it’s a bit sub-Darcy: not gratuitous/lingering enough, in my professional opinion. And Bridgerton wouldn’t be Bridgerton without Georgian cunnilingus; last time, performed by Simon (Regé-Jean Page) upon Daphne Bridgerton (Phoebe Dynevor) against a thankfully sturdy staircase. Here, such scenes are a long time, erm, coming. Which says it all about this serving of frothy, anachronistic, knowingly silly Bridgerton, based on Julia Quinn’s historical novel series; it arrives with a sumptuous jangle of crystal chandeliers, but then it never quite gets going. It doesn’t matter that there is less sex in this series of Bridgerton, but I am bothered by the general air of aimlessness. A huge 2020 lockdown festive smash, the first series (created by Chris Van Dusen for the Shonda Rhimes stable) might have been absurd – an unashamed sugar rush of period drama trifle – but it had heart and sparkle. Now, with Simon absent, Daphne is reduced to wandering the manicured lawns like a decorous ghost, perhaps dreaming of staircases past, while Anthony hunts for a bride with a list of requirements: “Tolerable, dutiful, suitable hips for child-bearing…” – that make him come across like an 18th-century Gene Hunt. It’s not a disaster, especially when compared with Sky Atlantic’s period offering The Gilded Age, which I am still watching in fascinated horror as it lifelessly plods to an anticlimax. Bridgerton still boasts deal-with-it colour-blind casting and witty orchestral pop takes (Pink, Alanis Morissette, Madonna). Eloise (Claudia Jessie) quotes Mary Wollstonecraft and appears to have caught a dose of feminism, possibly from the lower orders. Elsewhere, denizens of the “ton” are variously charmed, snubbed, courted, friend-zoned and swindled. Still – spoiler alert – maybe it was a mistake, TV-wise, for “insipid wallflower” Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) to be revealed so early on as scandal sheet scribe “Lady Whistledown” (voiced by Julie Andrews). There are eight books in Quinn’s series and already Bridgerton is dragging and puffing as if weighed down by petticoats dipped in wet cement. There’s much to relish about BBC Four’s Skint, seven different perspectives on poverty, not least the sheer diversity of artists who’ve experienced it. Creatively overseen by actor-director Peter Mullan (My Name Is Joe) and writer Lisa McGee (Derry Girls), these 15-minute monologues feature contributions from both of them, alongside other writers, directors and actors. Of the four shown on TV last week, the opener, McGee’s I’d Like to Speak to the Manager, performed by Derry Girls’ Saoirse-Monica Jackson, is a twisty fantasy of class resentment that unfolds like a Tale of the (brassic) Unexpected. Hannah, by author Kerry Hudson, depicts a young mother (Emma Fryer) musing candidly but hopefully on her difficult circumstances. In Gabriel Gbadamosi’s surrealist Regeneration, Gary Beadle plays a market-stall mushroom-seller, pondering gentrification and his childhood. For me, the standout is Byron Vincent’s No Grasses, No Nonces, where Michael Socha (This Is England) gives a nerve-shredding performance as a lost soul whose youthful impoverishment made him vulnerable to abuse. Skint emerges as a kind of Talking Heads of the dispossessed: short, pithy soliloquies of lived experience. The depth and range convey an essential ugly truth: that poverty is not just one, but many wrecking balls, and the impact can be never-ending. Even before the songs blare out (X-Ray Spex, the Fall), the BBC Two docudrama Then Barbara Met Alan, is imbued with riotous punk/post-punk spirit. Written by Jack Thorne and Genevieve Barr, directed by Bruce Goodison and Amit Sharma, it documents the fight for rights by disabled activist Barbara Lisicki (Ruth Madeley) and Alan Holdsworth (Arthur Hughes). Both fringe entertainers at the turn of the 1990s, they start a relationship, then, along with others, a “crip” revolution, disrupting the ITV charity telethon – “pre ‘show us your stumps’ voyeurism,” says Barbara, going on to fight for civil rights at the forefront of the Disabled People’s Direct Action Network (DAN). Lisicki, Holdsworth and their allies shun condescension (one DAN slogan is “piss on pity”), demanding choice, respect and law changes. Madeley is a whip-smart, articulate Barbara, who has a child with the impassioned, chaotic Alan. While their relationship collapses, the activism continues: people throwing themselves out of wheelchairs and inserting themselves beneath buses. The hard-won achievement of the 1995 Disability Discrimination Act was to prove insufficient, but it was still a start. What a wild, uncompromising ride. Barbara and Alan come across as clever, disruptive, dignified, funny, sexual, above all, real, breathing, alive. The real-life Barbara and Alan appear towards the end, reinforcing what a superb job Madeley and Hughes have done. This is a serious civil rights drama, delivered with bracing counterculture energy. My well-developed evil side enjoyed the opening episodes of Channel 4’s six-part The Simpler Life. It showed 24 Britons taking on the spartan, community-spirited Amish lifestyle on a Devon farm, under the guidance of an Amish family from Ohio, for a social experiment run by the University of California, Berkeley. The women have it worse, stuck with household chores and stupid long dresses, while the men get to wear trousers and build barns. Penny, a former footballer’s PA, is rebellious from the off – “Why would I spend two hours baking a cake?” – but the true comedy is in the bad-tempered community meetings where the sin of individualism is on full display. This is Big Brother with harvests and an updated Imagine vibe: “Imagine there’s no Netflix”. It’s now been reported that the entire production is in jeopardy because participants are withdrawing, this withdrawing presumably being in the direction of electricity, mobile phones, social media and Deliveroo. Blur were right: modern life is rubbish. Until you try the alternative.

3/27/2022,"Happy Mothering Sunday – an expression so cloyingly Edwardian, a tinted daguerreotype of an Angel in the House caressing the rosy cheek of a sturdy sort in frilly bloomers, it makes my teeth ache. If you celebrate, that is. If not, I get it: my mum’s dead and I know it can feel like a sharp poke to an already bruised heart. It’s nice that brands now ask if you’d like to opt out of their “10% off labiaplasty for mum on her special day” messages (enter WILLTHISDO at checkout), but it feels like just another round of emails to wade through. As with most Mother’s Day gifts, I suppose it’s the thought that counts. It doesn’t feel like the cheeriest time to be in the reproduction game. A maternity hospital bombed, and a mother and baby killed. Missouri making a murderous attempt to criminalise terminating ectopic pregnancies, because apparently, they’re only pro unborn lives, including non-viable ones. Even in the best-case scenario, you may be struggling to calm your kids’ fear of nuclear annihilation or climate collapse, when the same things wake you nightly. But we take our small joys where we can, especially now, and 20 years of Mother’s Days have provided me with a few. Even – perhaps especially – when it goes wrong. I get a perverse pleasure from the ones where everyone forgets, or I get a card pinched from my own carefully curated collection; some weird part of me quite likes the chance to hone my martyred expression. Thank goodness, because families being what they are, there’s more chance of pear-shaped than champagne brunch. Here’s my timeline of suboptimal, yet strangely perfect, Mother’s Days. Happy what? With a new baby, after a few snatched hours (ha, seconds) of sleep, you wake in bleary, milky confusion to a text, perhaps from a relative, but more likely from Uber Eats, wishing you a happy Mother’s Day. Is this who you are now and if so, shouldn’t something, well, nice, happen? It won’t. The baby is a dictatorial blob with no access to Interflora. Your partner, if you have one, will do nothing, because no one can instantly assimilate this new, totally alien responsibility along with all the other new and alien responsibilities of having a baby. Your reaction will depend on what hormones are raging through your ravaged carcass: anything from “meh” to Medea. Toddlers respect nothing Your child – a raging ball of id – has absolutely no interest in wishing you a happy anything at this time. Just settle down and watch your 5am Hey Duggee while being hit over the head with a wooden spoon. This is your life now. Special breakfast You can hear the precarious wobble of the tray, but what does it hold? Cheerios mixed with a handful of fishtank gravel? A pint of undiluted squash? Pawed slices of cold toast smeared with a proprietary blend of Marmite and chocolate spread? If your child gives you something they like themselves, suggest “sharing” (I’ve spared my pancreas mountains of Lucky Charms with this ruse). If not, enjoy starting your special day with Lego-studded crumpets, a raw potato or glitter putty. Craft If it can be fashioned from a Dairylea box and glue stick, expect to see it on your breakfast tray during the primary school years. For me, this was the Laminator: Dark Fate era – my sons’ school obviously had one and churned out identikit bookmarks every year with an efficiency that would put Moonpig to shame. Set your features to thrilled and don’t get glitter in the bed, it is an unforgiving exfoliant. Teenager roulette Teenage Mother’s Days are a thrilling lottery: you might get a thoughtful gift, or enjoy a meal, bursting with love and pride at seeing them bloom into fascinating, funny adults. More likely, you’ll get a lecture about phallocentric capitalism or a fistful of flowers of dubious origin (forgetful youths in my home town traditionally rely on the daffodils lining the city walls). Or nothing, because no one is up, or in. One year, following a fairly harrowing stretch of parenting, we “celebrated” in a pizzeria in the company of our silent younger son and the internet router, because his brother refused to come and, er, consequences or something. I forget, but I know I enjoyed offering the router a slice of quattro stagioni. Adulthood “I guess that’s over?” said my husband, hesitantly, but with real hope, as we watched a TV ad for some BOGOF Mother’s Day meal deal last week. Our sons are now adults, so he believes they – and he – are off the hook. Fat chance. I have no plans to relinquish my moment of mild diva-dom, this weird, imperfect feast day for the separation of my rectus abdominis. The truth is, there’s something about a crappy Mother’s Day that feels right: I am a pretty crappy mother lots of the time, after all.
