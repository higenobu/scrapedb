3/31/2022,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Russia's poor performance in its Ukraine war will make China more cautious about attacking Taiwan as Beijing is watching the conflict to learn military lessons, Taiwan's government on Wednesday cited a meeting of senior advisers as saying. Taiwan, claimed by China as its own territory, has raised its alert level since the Russian invasion, wary of Beijing possibly making a similar move on the island, though it has reported no signs this is about to happen. Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said in a statement following a meeting of its China policy advisers that Beijing was watching Russia's combat experience, Ukraine's resistance and international sanctions ""to deduce the possible situation of a conflict in the Taiwan Strait"". It cited the advisers as saying that the war had ""great lessons"" for China's People's Liberation Army, ""especially the Russian military's over-estimation of its long-range precision strikes"". Russia misjudged the war situation, did not properly analyse intelligence and its generals were promoted based on personal relationships, not talent, they added. ""This will also affect the trust of Chinese communist leaders in their army, and they will be more cautious when using force."" Russian precision-guided missiles are failing up to 60% of the time in Ukraine, U.S. officials with knowledge of intelligence on the issue have told Reuters, a possible explanation for the poor progress of Russia's invasion. The possible impact of the war on China's military thinking on Taiwan, and how China could attack the island, has been widely debated in official circles in Taipei. Asked about those kinds of remarks, China's Taiwan Affairs Office said earlier on Wednesday that the government was willing to make the greatest efforts to achieve ""peaceful reunification"". ""At the same time, we will never tolerate Taiwan independence. If Taiwan independence separatist forces dare to provoke and push things, or even cross red lines, we will take decisive measures,"" spokesperson Zhu Fenglian said in Beijing. China has been stepping up its military pressure against Taiwan over the past two years or so. Taiwan rejects China's sovereignty claims, and says only the island's people can decide their future.

3/31/2022,"A man who has been in prison for four decades after kidnapping a school bus of children and burying them alive in 1976, has been approved for parole, CNN and NBC News report. Frederick Woods, 70, was approved during a parole hearing on Friday at California Men's Colony, a state prison, after previously being denied 17 times. He had the support of two survivors. “I believe you have served enough time for the crime you committed,” said survivor Larry Park, who supported Woods' release along with Rebecca Reynolds Dailey. But Park added ""I’m concerned about the addiction you may have about money,” urging Woods to consider getting treatment. Woods along with his accomplices, brothers Richard and James Schoenfeld, kidnapped 26 children and their bus driver on July 15,1976 near Chowchilla, a town 125 miles southeast of San Francisco. USA TODAY reached out to California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. According to CNN, the group took the 27 hostages 100 miles away to Livermore where they were placed into a moving truck and buried alive. Woods and the brothers demanded $5 million from the state Board of Education. The children, aged 5 to 14, and bus driver were able to dig their way out after 16 hours. It was considered the largest mass kidnapping in U.S. history, the outlet reported. 'Time credits': Thousands of federal inmates to be released under 2018's First Step Act What's everyone talking about? Sign up for our trending newsletter to get the latest news of the day Gov. Gavin Newsom's late father, state Judge William Newsom, reduced all three men's life sentences in 1980 so they could have a chance at parole. Richard was released in 2012 after an appeals court order and James was paroled by then-Gov. Jerry Brown in 2015. At his parole hearing on Friday, Woods read an apology for his crime. “I’ve had empathy for the victims which I didn’t have then,” he said. “I’ve had a character change since then.” “I was 24 years old,"" he added. ""Now I fully understand the terror and trauma I caused. I fully take responsibility for this heinous act.” Because Woods committed the crime when he was young, he falls into a California law that requires parole commissioners to give greater weight to freeing inmates who were convicted in their youth, but are now elderly and have served long prison sentences. The approval from the parole hearing will become final within 120 days, then will be sent to Gov. Gavin Newsom where he will have 30 days to review the decision, CNN reported. Because it's not a murder conviction, Newsom can not overrule it, but instead send it to the Board of Parole hearings for review. Jennifer Brown Hyde, a survivor opposing Woods parole, said he had not made complete amends for the crime “He could have done much more,"" she said. “Even the settlement paid to some of us survivors was not sufficient. It was enough to pay for some therapy but not enough to buy a house.” Contributing: Associated Press This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: California man granted parole after kidnapping school bus of children",U.S./USA TODAY,Man who buried school bus full of children for $5 million ransom approved for parole,https://news.yahoo.com/man-buried-school-bus-full-153442091.html
