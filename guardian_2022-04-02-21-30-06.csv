4/2/2022,"The transport minister, Grant Shapps, said he has prevented the use of another private jet that has links to Russian oligarchs. Shapps tweeted on Saturday: “We won’t stand by and watch those who’ve made millions through [Russian president Vladimir] Putin’s patronage live their lives in peace as innocent blood is shed.” The Department for Transport (DfT) said it had issued a Notice to Airmen (Notam) to prevent the aircraft from taking off from London Luton Airport. The aircraft will remain at the airport while officials investigate further whether it falls under the recent sanctions legislation banning all aircraft connected with Russia, following its invasion of Ukraine. The DfT said it would not be commenting on the aircraft’s ownership while it investigates. The department has already detained two jets belonging to billionaire oil tycoon Eugene Shvidler, a sanctioned billionaire business associate of Roman Abramovich. Shvidler was a former boss and shareholder in Abramovich’s steel company, Evraz, and is thought to be worth an estimated £1.2bn. New laws were introduced after the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. Russian airlines and private jets have been banned from landing in the UK, along with a block on any aircraft owned, operated or chartered by anyone connected with Russia. Other rules mean that other forms of transport thought to be connected to Putin’s regime can be seized. On Tuesday morning, a £38m superyacht, Phi, was impounded in Canary Wharf, east London. It had arrived in the capital for the World Superyacht Awards. Shapps turned up with a TV crew shortly after police boarded the boat. It later emerged that it was owned by Vitaly Vasilievich Kochetkov, who is not on the UK sanctions list. The ship was registered in Saint Kitts and Nevis, but sailed under the Maltese flag. A government source told the FT: “This yacht detention is the product of weeks of inquiries, spanning the world, by the National Crime Agency and other agencies. The ownership of many of these vessels and private aircraft is buried in shell companies or shielded by pretend owners. It is the oligarch equivalent of the Russian matryoshka doll – where each layer conceals another, and then another.”",News/World news,UK prevents use of private jet linked to Russian oligarchs,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/02/uk-prevents-use-of-private-jet-linked-to-russian-oligarchs
4/2/2022,"At 2.26pm on 6 January last year, Donald Trump picked up a White House phone and placed a call to Mike Lee, the Republican senator from Utah. The communication came at a very significant moment. Thirty-seven minutes earlier, a riot had been declared by Washington DC police. Minutes after that the then vice-president, Mike Pence, was rushed out of the Senate chamber, where he had been presiding over Congress’s certification of Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election, and put into hiding. Fifteen minutes before Trump made the call his supporters, exhorted by the sitting president to “fight like hell” against what he falsely claimed was a rigged election, broke through a window in the south front of the Capitol and entered the heart of American democracy. The January 6 insurrection was under way. Yet when you look for recorded details of Trump’s 2.26pm call which was made, as Hugo Lowell of the Guardian revealed, on an official White House landline, they are nowhere to be found. The Lee call was one of an unknown number that Trump made during a mysterious gap of 7 hours 37 minutes that exists in the call logs – precisely the timeframe of the Capitol attack. Those missing call logs, disclosed by the Washington Post and CBS News, raise several burning questions – how did the records disappear? who carried out the excising? – but none more urgent than this: what was Trump trying to hide? “A gap like this doesn’t happen by accident. It’s not a coincidence,” said Charlie Sykes, columnist at the Trump-resistant conservative outlet the Bulwark. “There is no innocent explanation here – somebody made the decision to rip up the record for the crucial hours of January 6 and there has to be a reason why.” What Trump is trying to hide lies at the heart of the House committee investigation into the January 6 insurrection. The former president has consistently tried to block information flowing to the committee – pressuring his inner circle not to testify, tearing up documents before they were handed over. The stakes in the tussle over evidence rose sharply this week when a federal judge said in a ruling that Trump “more likely than not … dishonestly conspired to obstruct” Congress on 6 January. That would be a criminal act. There has never been any doubt that Trump inspired his supporters to descend on Washington on that fateful day, nor that he encouraged them to protest along the lines of the “big lie” that the election was stolen from him. Three weeks before the insurrection he tweeted: “Big protest in DC on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!” But Trump is a past master at making outrageous comments while simultaneously disguising or leaving ambiguous his actual intentions. What exactly did he mean by “will be wild!”? How far was he prepared to take that proposition? Critically, would the missing call logs covering the timeframe of the insurrection offer clues to his motivation? One call that it is known Trump made within the black hole of those missing hours between 11.17am and 6.54pm was to Pence. Late on 6 January the incumbent president made one final attempt to persuade his deputy to commit an illegal act – to delay certification of Biden’s win in contravention of his constitutional duties. According to a leaked account of the call to the New York Times, Trump cajoled Pence with the immortal words: “You can either go down in history as a patriot, or you can go down in history as a pussy.” Pence went down in history as a patriot – by doing his constitutional duty and certifying the legitimate result. But that phone call marked an important point in the chronology of Trump’s coup attempt: it amounted to a point of no return – his last move to hang on to power through political persuasion. Had Trump strayed beyond that point, he would have entered much darker territory. As Sykes put it: “When he got off the phone to Mike Pence, who did he call next? Once he knew the vice-president was not going to do his bidding, what next?” David Frum, a former White House speechwriter for George W Bush, writing in the Atlantic, said there were two major lines of inquiry: did Trump give a go-ahead to the Capitol insurrection in advance, and did he coordinate in any way with the attackers. The January 6 committee has its focus firmly locked on the so-called “War Room” – the gaggle of Trump’s close aides that gathered at the Willard hotel in Washington as the “command centre” of Trump’s efforts to subvert the election. They included his former strategist Steve Bannon, his lawyer Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman, the conservative law professor who prepared a detailed plan of how Trump could hold on to power illegitimately. As the Guardian has reported, Trump conveyed to the group Pence’s refusal to go along with the coup plot. But beyond that we remain in the dark. As a result of the missing logs it is unclear whether the then president remained in touch with the Willard Hotel group as the insurrection unfolded. Nor is it known whether they discussed any further tactics. The gap in official records could also hamper the committee’s attempt to ascertain whether there were direct contacts between Trump and January 6 organisers. Ali Alexander, who instigated the “Stop the Steal” movement and who planned a “One Nation Under God” rally in the Capitol grounds that was canceled amid the violence, has been a figure of interest to the committee. Before the insurrection he spoke to Kimberly Guilfoyle, the partner of Trump’s son Don Jr. CNN has reported that he also said in videos posted before the attack that he planned to reach out to the far-right groups the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers to request they provide security for his rally. Both organisations have members who are being prosecuted for criminal acts on January 6. Earlier this month the leader of the Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio, was arrested on conspiracy and other charges. The founder of the Oath Keepers and 10 other members have been charged with seditious conspiracy. Alexander testified before the January 6 committee in December. In his opening remarks, he said: “I had nothing to do with any violence or lawbreaking that happened on January 6. I had nothing to do with the planning. I had nothing to do with the preparation. And I had nothing to do with the execution.” Those words could easily have come from the mouth of Donald J Trump. The challenge facing the committee, in the absence of the vanishing phone logs, is to establish are they true.",News/US news,What is Trump hiding?

4/2/2022,"Pope Francis has said he plans to visit the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in what would be the most high-profile visit of a world figure since Russia invaded the country. The head of the Catholic church was invited by both Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, along with Ukrainian religious leaders on 8 March. At the time of the invitation, the Vatican had confirmed receipt of a letter and said the pope was praying for Ukrainians but made no mention of any travel plans. But asked by a reporter on the plane taking him from Rome to Malta on Saturday whether he was considering the invitation, Francis said: “Yes, it is on the table.” He gave no further details. The invitation from Ukrainian political leaders has been supported by Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk of Ukraine’s Byzantine Rite Catholic church and Ukraine’s ambassador to the Vatican, Andriy Yurash. Francis has previously described Vladimir Putin’s war as a “unjustified aggression” and denounced the “atrocities”, but has been careful not to mention Russian culpability for the war. On Thursday, the European parliament’s president, Roberta Metsola, met Zelenskiy in Kyiv to give the message that the EU would help rebuild the country after the war. The most high-profile visit so far, however, was undertaken by the prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia on 16 March. In a press conference after the meeting, the Czech prime minister, Petr Fiala, told Ukrainians: “Europe stands with you.” Pope Francis, 85, was visiting Malta on Saturday for a two-day trip in an attempt to draw attention to a migration crisis exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. After landing, he used for the first time an elevator to descend from the ITA aircraft on to the tarmac. He was also seated in his popemobile during a tour of the island’s capital, Valletta. Francis has been suffering from a painful knee inflammation for months. More than 10.5 million people have been displaced either within Ukraine or abroad as refugees, totalling around a quarter of the country’s population. About 13 million people are estimated to be in urgent need of humanitarian assistance across the country. Metsola met the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, with Ukrainian refugees on Saturday morning at Otwock school in Warsaw. She said: “We are impressed by the efforts made by Poland, its communities and citizens. You have given people in need a safe and secure space. This is heartwarming to see it – it is the best of Europe. “However, Poland has been carrying the largest weight of the consequences of the war outside Ukraine. Therefore, we need more support to Poland and other countries that are receiving and hosting people who are fleeing the war in Ukraine.”",News/World news,Pope Francis plans to visit Kyiv at invitation of Ukraine’s president,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/02/pope-francis-plans-visit-kyiv-invitation-ukraine-president
4/2/2022,"On the southern steps of the Mississippi state capitol last week, a group of protesters gathered in front of a bronzed casket. It was empty, but for piles of paper, strewn across the inside. They were printouts of dozens of bills that have died in the state legislature in recent months; a bill to expand healthcare coverage for new mothers; a bill to help provide healthy food options in rural and underserved communities, a bill to restore voting rights to formerly incarcerated people. All had failed before being voted on in a legislature that is controlled by a Republican supermajority. “These are bills that the people of Mississippi never got a chance to legislate,” said Nsombi Lambright, an organizer with the Mississippi Poor People’s Campaign, as she addressed the assembled crowd. “And so when bills like these don’t make it through the process, people seldom have a voice, we seldom have a way to then come back and say: what happened?” Just a week earlier, however, the state was in the national spotlight for a piece of legislation that it had passed as a priority: a law seeking to ban the teaching of critical race theory (CRT) in Mississippi’s schools, colleges and universities. Critical race theory is an academic practice that examines the ways in which racism operates in US laws and society. Mississippi, a crucible of the civil rights movement and the state with the largest proportion – about 38% – of Black residents anywhere in the US, became the latest of 15 states to enact laws suppressing teaching of the discipline. The issue has become a pivotal clarion call for rightwing policymakers in America’s ongoing culture wars. The bill had been voted through on partisan lines. When it passed the state senate in January, every Black senator withheld their vote and walked out in protest. Every vote for the bill in the House came from white Republican lawmakers. As he signed the bill into law, Mississippi’s Republican governor, Tate Reeves, said the legislation would combat “indoctrination in our state”. He argued, without citing evidence, that “children are dragged to the front of the classroom and are coerced to declare themselves as oppressors, taught that they should feel guilty because of the color of their skin, or that they are inherently a victim because of their race.” The Mississippi department of education has repeatedly stated that critical race theory is not being taught in public schools. Reporting indicates it is taught in just one higher education class in the entire state, at the University of Mississippi School of Law.Many who observed the legislation pass, including Democrats in the statehouse, argued the bill represented a direct backlash against bipartisan efforts to remove the Confederate battle emblem from the state’s flag, which occurred in 2020 after the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement. “It is retribution and retaliation for the flag coming down,” said the Democratic state representative Cheikh Taylor. “And I would dare say that many of my Republican counterparts were under tremendous pressure to bring this up.” He added: “What he [the governor] has shown is that he’s willing to align himself with divisive policies that are heavily red meat items for his far, far-right base.” Taylor sits on the house universities and colleges committee and became one of the most outspoken opponents of the bill as it passed through the legislature. “This whole debate was centered around ignorance. For me, ignorance is not not knowing. It’s a willingness not to know,” he said. “History needs to be told as is – it doesn’t need to be sanitized, whitewashed … surely we cannot sanction our public school systems and our districts for teaching history?” Like many other CRT bills around the country, the wording of Mississippi’s legislation is short and vague. It prohibits public schools and universities from compelling “students to personally affirm, adopt or adhere … that any sex, race, ethnicity, religion or national origin is inherently superior or inferior”. It also blocks public educational institutions from making a “distinction or classification of students based on account of race”. Despite not defining CRT directly, the bill stipulates that any school, college or university found to have violated these tenets could lose public funding. Advocates have warned of a chilling effect on school and college campuses around the state. Students too have begun to brace themselves for the uncertainty of how the legislation may be implemented. Although it was spring break last week, a number of students, high school, college and university, had come to the protest outside the state capitol. Telesia Bracey, a 17-year-old student at Jim Hill high school, spoke before the crowd. It was the first protest she had ever attended and she told the Guardian that history was her favorite subject. Her speech began with a reference to Brown v Board of Education, the landmark supreme court ruling that established segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. “Yet here we are,” she said. “Almost 68 years later, having a conversation and battling over the reality of the continued erasure of not only Black history, but the history and legacy of oppression, as if slavery, Jim Crow, mass incarceration, police brutality and discrimination were all a part of Houdini’s famous tricks and could be made to disappear.” Maisey Brown, a 20-year-old politics student at Jackson State University, said organizers on campus were now in the initial phases of monitoring how and if the legislation would affect their studies. “It’s a very broad bill, which makes it even more scary and easy to manipulate,” she said. “Right now we are in the process of making sure we completely understand what the bill is actually trying to do. And then secondly, figuring out how we can ensure that our history is not being watered down on any level of education – from kindergarten to collegiate level.” For Jeremy Marquell-Bridges, a 34-year-old studying process engineering at Mississippi Gulf Coast community college, the possibilities felt chilling. “The thing I fear is the thing we’re seeing now. We have a generation of people who don’t understand that what they’re saying or doing could be offensive to certain people,” he said. “The manipulation of history does what it always does. It confuses people and recreates the same problems over and over.”",News/US news,Opponents of Mississippi’s anti- critical race theory law fear whitewashing of history,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/02/mississippi-anti-critical-race-theory-law-whitewashing-history
4/2/2022,"Many Argentinians will this Saturday celebrate the 40th anniversary of the day their country’s troops landed on the Falklands, the South Atlantic islands that Argentina has long claimed as its own. But for Eduardo Ortuondo, 2 April will always be “a day of sadness”, due to the torture he and about 200 fellow veterans endured at the hands of their Argentinian commanders during the 1982 war. Within days of that triumphant first landing at the islands’ capital Port Stanley, Argentinian soldiers were being subjected to the kind of cruelty previously reserved for political prisoners back home. Troops were starved, staked to the ground or made to lie in pools of freezing water for hours. Not a few died at the hands of their own officers, say the veterans. Veterans like Ortuondo have been seeking justice for years, and they have now launched a fresh push for Argentina’s supreme court to review their case. “Many of us went to fight as volunteers, but not to go through that kind of hell. Our primary enemies – apart from the cold and the British troops – turned out to be our own superiors,” said Ortuondo, now 60. Soldiers like Ortuondo at first believed that their cases were exceptions but soon realized that the brutality was systematic – perhaps unsurprising in a military dictatorship also responsible for the “disappearance” of about 30,000 young people in death camps across Argentina. “To us it was the continuation of the torture that was already being practiced by a brutal dictatorship against civilians on the mainland,” said the veteran, who endured various incidents of torture. The generals claimed they were waging a third world war against young communists who threatened to convert Argentina into another Cuba – despite the fact that Argentina’s armed insurgents had been largely defeated by the civilian governments of President Juan Perón and his wife and successor, Isabel Martínez. “We knew we were living under a de facto regime, and that Argentina’s military abused young people like ourselves, barely out of high school,” Ortuondo said. “But to all of us the Malvinas were, are and will be Argentinian – and we went to fight full of patriotic pride. We knew that they were capable of all kind of barbarities, but we thought that they would look after their own troops.”Ortuondo and many like him found just the opposite. Once on the islands – known in Argentina as Las Malvinas – officers and NCOs hoarded rations and stole soldiers’ food. Ortuondo did not receive a single one of dozens of food packages sent by his family. Once, a superior officer caught Ortuondo licking an empty jar of marmalade. As punishment he was made to lie in a freezing pool of water in the inclement South Atlantic weather. “Water on the islands seeps up from the ground. They put four stakes in the earth and tied my hands and feet to them. They used very thin rope, which is excruciatingly painful. In some other cases they used wire to increase the suffering even further. So there I was, staked to the ground, with the snow falling on me, the cold worsening my pain. Then a sergeant stood on the inner arch of one of my feet and started jumping from one foot to the other.” After the end of the war, returning veterans were secretly made to sign non-disclosure documents, pledging never to talk about what they had seen or endured on the islands. Meanwhile, Argentinian society turned its back on the veterans, because of their perceived association with the dictatorship. It took many years, and the suicides of about a thousand veterans, before they could speak about their plight. Veterans like Ortuondo have been seeking justice for 15 years, ever since they opened their first case against a former superior in 2007. Despite some advances, including legally proving the existence of the crimes comitted against them, in 2015 Argentina’s supreme court invoked the statute of limitations to overturn a case against a non-commissioned-officer accused of torture on the islands. The ruling slammed a door in the face of the veterans seeking justice for the tortures they endured.The veterans have since appealed to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which has organized talks between the government and the veterans to find a solution. But the veterans are insisting that the torture they endured should be declared a human rights crime, and so not bound by the statute of limitations.Earlier this month a group of veterans, including Ortuondo, marched on the supreme court demanding a review of their case. “I don’t know why the supreme court is so scared. Maybe they’re scared of the military, that they might return to power, or maybe the supreme court is simply playing for time hoping we’ll go away. But it won’t work, because the older we get, the more passionate we become and the more anxious we are to see our case brought to justice.”",News/World news,Argentinian Falklands veterans mark ‘day of sadness’ over torture they endured,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/02/argentina-falklands-veterans-day-of-sadness
4/2/2022,"Some lessons, it seems, are never learned. Gareth Southgate may have been characteristically measured in his response to Friday’s World Cup draw but most seemed to follow Kyle Walker’s line that “you’ve got to be happy with the teams we’ve drawn”. The triumphalism wasn’t quite as strident as before the 2010 World Cup, but if other teams really are inspired by the misunderstood ironies of Three Lions, England’s group-stage opponents are going to be raging at some of Saturday morning’s headlines. Quite apart from the dangers of jingoistic complacency, this is not an easy draw. “Some of the ties are potentially trickier than just the rankings,” said Southgate, but the rankings are tricky enough. By the Fifa rankings, this is the toughest group. In part that is a consequence of the uncertainty over the final European team because of the postponements caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That unknown side was classed as a Pot 4 team in the draw, but of the three sides involved only Scotland would be a Pot 4 team; Wales and Ukraine would have been in Pot 3. But here we are – already – talking about the minutiae of football. This is what sportswashing does and why it is so insidious, infecting a thing we love so we end up ignoring the tawdry horror of the spectacle. England’s first Group B game will be played in the Khalifa Stadium, where the British construction worker Zac Cox fell to his death in 2017. His was one of only three work-related deaths on World Cup-related construction sites acknowledged by the Qatari authorities, although Amnesty International doubts those figures. There have been at least 6,500 deaths of migrant workers on infrastructure projects in Qatar. It turns out they have paid more than £1bn for the privilege. When Malcolm Bidali, a Kenyan worker, highlighted concerns about working conditions, he was held in solitary confinement for a month before eventually being allowed to leave Qatar two months later having paid a fine for spreading “false news”. Abdullah Ibhais is still in jail after defending migrant workers. There was an emphasis around the draw on Qatar’s culture of hospitality. Wealthy Europeans certainly seem to enjoy it. But LGBTQ+ pressure groups are still awaiting basic assurances. This week major general Abdulaziz Abdullah Al Ansari, chairman of the national counter-terrorism committee of Qatar, said that rainbow flags may be confiscated to “protect” the person carrying them. That hardly raises confidence and seems in direct contravention of regulations 15 and 23 of Fifa’s statutes, which stipulate the responsibility of members and confederations “to prohibit all forms of discrimination”. Regulation 4 makes clear that includes “gender” and “sexual orientation”. It has been striking how aggressive the Qatari tone has been over the past couple of days, with the secretary general of the supreme committee for delivery and legacy, Hassan al-Thawadi, telling the president of the Norwegian Football Federation, Lise Klaveness, to “educate” herself after she suggested that “the migrant workers injured, the families of those that died, must be cared for”. That process of education might be easier, of course, if journalists – such as the Norwegian film crew arrested last November – weren’t subject to intimidation when they tried to report on such issues. If that is the approach now when there has been time to prepare a PR strategy, you wonder what may happen come the chaos of the tournament itself. A Honduran delegate insisted this wasn’t the time or the place for such discussions. But if not now, when? It’s not those who point to the outrages who are tainting the World Cup. And if that means some awkward gear changes, that is the nature of this tournament. And so back to the group. As Southgate pointed out, that third game against the winners of Uefa Path A will be difficult whoever qualifies. It could be Ukraine who, carrying all the emotions of the war and fired by the sense of fighting for a cause, will be very different from the team England beat 4-0 last summer at the Euros. Or it could be a British side. Even at Wembley last June, a derby against Scotland brought England’s poorest performance of that tournament. History offers no great reason for optimism against the USA either, with England failing to win either of their two previous meetings at World Cups. There was Rob Green’s howler and the 1-1 draw in Rustenburg in 2010, the beginning of what, at least for four years, seemed a uniquely bleak campaign. And 60 years before that was the 1-0 defeat in Belo Horizonte. The USA then were a ragtag bunch of largely amateur players, few of whom would qualify under modern regulations on nationality. Now they have probably the most promising squad in their history, with players who are regulars at Chelsea, Juventus, Borussia Dortmund and Barcelona. England begin against Iran, a country they have never played before. The UK imposed sanctions on Iran in 2007 and although the release of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori last month removes an immediate flashpoint, there will be inevitable political tension. Iran are probably not the 21st best side in the world, even if that is what the Fifa rankings say. They have won only two games at the World Cup, but one of them was against the USA in 1998. They are solid and well-organised, conceding only five goals in 10 games in the third round of Asian qualifying. Group of death? Well, in this World Cup they all are, and the metaphor should probably be retired on grounds of taste. Group of baffling complex politics? Well, in the modern age, obviously. The likelihood is that England will go through, that it will be a grind and there will be great outpourings of frustration on the way, talk of the need to unleash this great generation of attacking talent, based in part in the underestimation of England’s opponents. And none of it will matter because World Cups are not won in the group stage but in knockout games against the elite. And none of it will matter because football shouldn’t be a propaganda tool, and its great tournaments shouldn’t be made possible by exploited labour.",Sport/Football,English glee belies tricky World Cup draw and dangers of complacency | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/02/england-glee-belies-tricky-world-cup-draw-and-dangers-of-complacency

4/2/2022,"Schools are being downgraded by Ofsted if children questioned by inspectors cannot recall the names of rivers in geography or struggle to explain key concepts in history, according to headteachers. Under a new inspection framework, schools risk being marked down if pupils fail to adequately recall or articulate what they have been taught, sometimes years before, when given an impromptu “pop quiz” by inspectors. At one flagship secondary school, an outstanding rating was lowered to good when 11- and 12-year-olds were unable to explain clearly “the principle of the rule of law”. Ofsted inspections in England were resumed at the end of last year after a suspension during the pandemic. Schools are being judged under a new framework introduced in 2019, which focuses more on teaching and the curriculum. Outstanding schools that were, up until recently, exempt from routine inspection are now being visited. Amanda Spielman, Ofsted’s chief inspector of education, has said that she expects the number of outstanding schools, currently one in five, to be cut by half under the new regime. As part of the framework, inspectors conduct “deep dives” in four to six subjects to explore planning, teaching and the impact on pupils’ learning. This involves inspectors asking randomly chosen pupils about what they have learned to test what they know and have retained. Headteacher organisations are increasingly concerned that schools are being marked down on the strength of the responses given by nervous children, some of them infants, questioned without prior warning by adults they do not know. Inspection reports refer to “gaps in pupils’ knowledge and understanding” and cite instances of pupils not able to remember or articulate taught content or who display “shallow” or “disjointed” understanding. Schools say too much weight is being given to these responses. The Ofsted handbook says inspectors must take “a rounded view” of the quality of education and use a variety of types of evidence in their judgments. Despite having the best GCSE results in its borough in 2019, and achieving outcomes for disadvantaged pupils that are higher than the national average for non-disadvantaged students, Ursuline High School, a Catholic girls school in Wimbledon, has just been demoted from outstanding to good. The school, deemed a flagship secondary by Merton council, has challenged the judgment. It believes the downgrade is due, in large part, to the lead inspector’s concern about responses by Year 8 pupils to questions he posed about “the principle of the rule of law” which they had covered in Year 7. According to the school, this incident has been given too much significance and wrongly used as evidence of a more systemic issue in the quality of education. In the 2019 GCSE results, 85% of history students at the school were awarded grades 9-5, with half achieving the top grades of 7-9. Ursuline High’s submission to Ofsted said: “The school does not dispute the finding that the topic of the rule of law was not sufficiently explicit in the schemes of learning. The school is, however, disputing the disproportionate weight placed upon that fact to support the overall assessment that its quality of education is not therefore outstanding. “That would be to place an undue … weight on that one piece of evidence and inconsistent with the overarching thesis that an accurate judgment on quality must be reached only after taking all evidence into account.” In another instance, inspectors who downgraded Coalway Community Infant School, in the Forest of Dean, from “outstanding” to “requires improvement”, cited an instance where pupils, who are aged up to seven, could not “order important events in history as they have gaps in their knowledge”. Headteacher organisations said last night that other schools have had similar experiences. “School leaders are increasingly worried about the conclusions some inspectors draw in response to pupils saying the ‘wrong’ thing or giving the ‘wrong’ answer or not understanding a question,” said Ian Hartwright, senior policy adviser at the National Association of Head Teachers. “It is really problematic to try to gauge how much children know by asking them ‘pop quiz’ questions and seeing if they remember things and can articulate [them] adequately. This kind of approach is subjective and variable. Neither of these is a good thing in an inspection system where you need consistency.” He cited an example of a school that felt it had been marked down because pupils in a geography class could not remember the name of a river they had covered in a lesson. “I’ve just had another example come across my desk last week where a school is absolutely convinced that they meet the criteria for outstanding but they were tripped up because children were asked about something they learnt in a previous year in design technology and they weren’t able to remember. According to the inspector, that showed that their knowledge wasn’t consolidated,” Hartwright added. “But there simply isn’t time for inspectors to accurately interrogate the curriculum in this way in a two-day inspection.An Ofsted spokeswoman said: “Talking to pupils is an important part of the inspection process, to help assess whether the school’s intentions around teaching are matched by what pupils actually know and understand. But it is never the case that pupils’ answers to questions would be the sole reason for a change in a school’s grade.”",News/Education,"‘Pop quiz’ Ofsted tests are downgrading schools unfairly, say heads",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/02/pop-quiz-ofsted-tests-are-downgrading-schools-unfairly-say-heads
4/2/2022,"The wail of an air-raid siren sends the group of Ukraine’s foreign fighters, including three British citizens, hurrying inside at their training camp in a secret location in Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital. Within the relative safety of a sturdy building, the 17 men amble around, chatting until the alarm passes and their military exercises can resume. Soon, though, there will be no such hiding place. The Britons and their brothers in arms – from countries including the US, Canada, Norway, Italy and France – have completed their five weeks of training and will be sent to the frontline as part of a fighting force known as the International Legion for the Territorial Defence of Ukraine. They know full well from those who have already served of the horrors that lie ahead. US officials have spoken of a major fresh assault on the capital, Kyiv, despite claims from the Kremlin that they are withdrawing in the north of the country out of respect for the ongoing peace talks. “If anyone says they’re not scared they are lying,” says James, 22, from Salford. “But I have come this far, I’m not going to turn back now. I’ve seen too many sad things to turn my back on these people… “The Russians say they are pulling back, but as you can see the alarm is going off – they’re not pulling back and, even if they are, they’re just going to pull back because they’ve been absolutely hammered, regroup, and attack somewhere else or attack here.” Since Volodymyr Zelesnskiy, Ukraine’s president, announced the formation of his foreign legion at the start of March, tens of thousands of people from around the world, some with a military background and many without, have arrived in Ukraine in what now amounts to the most significant international brigade since the Spanish civil war. The legion last week temporarily stopped recruiting those who lack experience due, in part, to a scarcity of firearms. But there is a sense among the British contingent that are already here that their presence, while not publicly endorsed, is privately accepted in London. Comments from the foreign secretary Liz Truss at the start of the war in which she said she would “absolutely” back those volunteering to fight only confirmed that feeling, despite her later backtracking. James says he was stopped at Manchester airport on his way out and told he would be arrested for terrorism on his return should he fight, but he is not concerned. “I’m doing nothing illegal,” he says. “According to my contacts in military intelligence, they are grateful for the veterans signing up,” says Paul, 27, from Greenwich, who served in the Mercian regiment of the British army between 2011 and 2016. That said, there is nothing gung-ho about the three Britons. There is no bloodlust. “Obviously, the intention is not to kill anyone, no one’s intention is ever to kill anyone,” says Paul. “But the Russians are advancing more than the government is letting on.” One of three declined to be interviewed. But James and Paul, polite, personable and switched on, were willing to talk about their motivations and background, although their true identities have been disguised. They both spent time in care as children, they say, and saw something in Ukraine’s desperate against-the-odds plight that would give them purpose. James, who had no military experience before leaving for Ukraine a week after the Russian invasion on 24 February, says he had lost his job working in a warehouse and had spent time on the streets. “They needed help, and I was doing nothing back at home. My life was going downhill so I thought I could do something better and help people who needed it. I didn’t think I would get very far because I didn’t have experience but I have done well, and here I am.” After spending his savings on flights, James arrived in the Polish city of Przemyśl near the Ukraine border before hitchhiking to a refugee camp. From there, he jumped in a car with some Ukrainian expats coming back to fight, and arrived across the border in the western city of Lviv, where he signed up. He was initially in the hands of former US special forces personnel who gave him some basic training before he joined the current unit. It has been a hard five weeks. “It’s all alien to me,” he says. “It’s new. But it is basically common sense. Once you get the hang of it, most things now just become natural to me. I hope that I remember that in combat” He adds: “I told my mum and dad I was coming here but I didn’t tell anyone else. Mum and Dad agree with it now because they’re proud of me. They know what’s going on. Obviously they don’t want me to be here. They want me to come home.” James believes he might rebuild his life in Ukraine. “I want to get citizenship and join their paratroopers,” he says. His commanding officer, Bruce, 38, from Wisconsin, says he believes the young Briton is ready for battle. A Ukrainian soldier, Vitaly Bilyak, 26, says there were already British fighters on the frontline, where they had proven their worth. Paul had thought his experience in the British armed forces could be useful. He quit his job as cabin crew for the airline easyJet and came over initially to help a humanitarian organisation extract people from the conflict hotspots around Kyiv. He is now training up Ukrainian soldiers, who he admits can be “trigger happy”. But they are in need. He will join the fight. And it is a cause he can believe in. “I don’t like bullies,” he says.",News/World news,‘I don’t like bullies’: British volunteers tell why they’re fighting  for Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/02/i-dont-like-bullies-british-volunteers-tell-why-theyre-fighting-for-ukraine
4/2/2022,"Thousands of people will take to the streets in the UK in protest against the sharp rise in energy prices, as a cabinet minister said the government could not “completely nullify” the increases. Demonstrations are due to take place on Saturday, including one outside Downing Street in central London, and others in Cardiff and Birmingham. The protests follow a major increase in the energy price cap on Friday, with an average household gas and electricity bill rising to £1,971 a year. A further jump in October could take the cost up to £2,600. Groups including the Trades Union Congress and anti-poverty campaigners have voiced alarm at the changes, and said that when combined with increasing inflation and low pay, it could push people into “impossible choices” between heating their homes or eating. A spokesperson for the People’s Assembly Against Austerity, the organisers of Saturday’s series of events, said: “Public outrage over the cost of living crisis is growing fast, and our response is gaining momentum.” Its national secretary, the former Labour MP Laura Pidcock, said: “We tell them about children going hungry and the government shrug, politically speaking.” The price increase is driven by more demand on energy as economies recover from the effects of the Covid pandemic, with supply unable to keep up. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also exacerbated the issue, with some countries stopping or limiting their purchasing of Russia’s oil and gas. Ministers have announced a council tax rebate for April and a £200 loan available from October to help soften the burden, but the Labour party has said there should be a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to help provide support to those in need. In France, the government has limited energy bill increases to 4% this year. Speaking on Sky News on Saturday, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said: “We [the government] can’t completely nullify the impacts of the global markets and global pressure, for example, on energy, which is obviously the main focus at the moment for most people. “But we will put in the support that we can, as and when we can, as I say, looking ... across the board at what we’re doing with the public’s money.” Labour said the government should bring in laws to keep prices down. The shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, said: “We would be meeting with oil and gas companies to make sure that it happened, and if it didn’t, then we’d be putting in legislative measures to make sure that it did. “I think we do need to see legislative measures if North Sea oil and gas companies, petrol retailers, are experiencing record profits and not passing any of those savings on to customers.” She said she was shocked that the increase in national insurance contributions was going ahead when people were having to deal with other spiralling costs. “It frankly beggars belief when we think about what people are having to pay over the coming weeks and months, that the government would not be doing much more to support people, let alone making things harder,” she told Times Radio. Amid a renewed focus on energy, the government’s strategy on the issue has yet to be revealed – weeks after it was due to be announced. Reports in the Times suggested that Boris Johnson was considering trebling the amount of onshore wind power by 2035, despite many Tory backbenchers opposing it. Nuclear power is also expected to feature heavily. Asked why there had been a delay and whether he supported onshore windfarms, Lewis said: “It’s complicated work to look at how we can have an energy policy package that’s holistic, that looks at all parts of energy, and we can become more domestically self-supportive on that, which will have a positive impact on prices. It’s right they take that time to have a look at it.”",Lifestyle/Money,Protests over soaring energy prices to take place across UK,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/02/protests-energy-prices-cap-uk-electricity-gas-household-bills
4/2/2022,"Only ghosts remain at the old asylum of Endenich in Germany, now a clean, orderly museum dedicated to the composer Robert Schumann (1810-1856). He ended his days there, isolated, suffering psychosis. Two of the only people who visited him were his wife, Clara Schumann, and the composer Johannes Brahms, a loyal friend to both but lovesick for Clara. This criss-crossing of emotions hovered over the recital given at a packed Barbican by the world’s starriest tenor, Jonas Kaufmann, his classy superstar companion, the soprano Diana Damrau, and Kaufmann’s revered long-term pianist, Helmut Deutsch, who had devised the programme. These three musicians have performed together many times and brought intimacy, contrast and vitality to these miniature dramas about the perils and joy of love. Alternating between Robert Schumann and Brahms, and between one another, Kaufmann and Damrau joined together in duets written by each composer or, in some cases, not. Brahms’s matchless Von ewiger Liebe, for one voice, was shared by both, to convincing effect. The evening reminded us of the rewards of a concert without frills: 39 songs, sung in German (with English surtitles), with only the briefest introduction from the two megastars explaining that – broadly – the first half were songs of anguish, the second of hope. Kaufmann is now fabled across the operatic world, in Wagner, Verdi, Massenet. Earlier this year, in Munich, he added Britten’s Peter Grimes, but his roots are in the songs of his own language. Hearing him perform Winterreise in Edinburgh long ago, when his John the Baptist curls were still black, his name unknown, I thought I would not hear Schubert’s song cycle sung better, a view that holds. (Nor did I predict he would sing Winter Wonderland on a Christmas album of supreme schmaltz, but if someone has to let it be him.) His distinctive quality, apart from his versatility, is the richness and dark timbre of the lower part of his voice, combined with secure, ringing top notes. There is now some sign of wear in soft moments, but in full voice he turned each song into a tiny opera, never forgetting Deutsch’s equal contribution in shading and colouring. Brahms’s Ach, wende diesen Blick, in its yearning and grief, showed Kaufmann at his best. So too did Stille Tranen (Silent Tears), building from introversion, the piano throbbing quietly, to distressed outburst, a high point of a generous evening. He and Damrau, a similarly multifaceted artist at home in lyric and coloratura roles, engaged in playful physical exchanges that were never exaggerated: an extended arm, a glance away. Damrau has impeccable diction and vocal gleam from top to bottom, with scarcely a weakness or snag. Her stage presence is vivacious but modest and she isn’t shy to look the diva. Frocks and glittering rocks don’t get many mentions in this column but her midway switch of gowns designed by Adrian Runhof added cheer and, given the state of the world, a reassuring comfort. Kaufmann and Damrau have made it. Royal Academy Opera supports those rising stars who hope they will. The postgraduate programme gathered a strong professional team - director Polly Graham, lute player Elizabeth Kenny and conductor Ryan Wigglesworth - to work with excellent students for a triple bill, part of the Royal Academy of Music’s bicentenary celebrations. With two versions of the Ariadne myth - Monteverdi’s Lamento d’Arianna and Richard Strauss’s anarchic Ariadne aux Naxos prologue - and a world premiere opera complete with green trolls, all tastes were met. Witch, by Freya Waley-Cohen to a libretto by Ruth Mariner, explores the witch archetype past and present. A teenager, Sarah/Sun Witch, seeks support from bullying via an online coven. Her story is interwoven with historical witch trials and a healer, Jane. In the first of two casts, Sophie Sparrow, also affecting as Monteverdi’s Arianna, sang Sarah. Bernadette Johns, outstanding as the Composer in Ariadne, was Jane. With some effective ensembles and a fast-moving score, skilfully played by the Royal Academy Sinfonia, the many episodes were held together by Graham’s ingenious staging and use of digital images (by Hayley Egan). There was rather too much to entangle on first encounter, but some streamlining should sort that out. The end is best explained verbatim from the synopsis: “Green Death Witch, Sarah and their friends develop a Penis Hex which aims to cleanse the world of toxic masculinity and goes viral.” Enigmatic, but no doubt essential.
