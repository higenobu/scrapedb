3/25/2022,"Saqib Mahmood was spurred on by the sight of his England teammates in their whites getting ready to take the field as he and Jack Leach mounted their determined 10th-wicket rearguard on the opening day in Grenada. The No 11 is not famed for his batting, given a career-best of 34 in first-class cricket for Lancashire. But his first innings at Test level – one that underlined his impressive temperament – could play a significant role in this decider against West Indies, turning 114 for nine into a healthier 204 all out by the close. Mahmood was last man out, chopping on the ball after he had moved to 49 with a rasping four off Jermaine Blackwood’s part-time spin, and admitted to feeling “gutted” afterwards; his motivation for the knock – and a record 10th-wicket stand of 90 for England in the Caribbean – was at least a source of amusement. “[When I got out to the middle] I did say to Leachy: ‘The cheeky fuckers have got their whites on,’” revealed Mahmood. “It did spur us on a little bit. I had a glance over later to see if some had taken them off but they had the whites on throughout. But yes, we did spot that. “We had little short targets, the first was seeing off that spell from Alzarri Joseph and Jayden Seales. They were a big threat. It could have fallen into pieces after the start we had but we stuck at it well. Hopefully we have tired those guys out.” England were 90 for eight before tea and will head into the second day knowing they must get the new ball talking like it did for West Indies on this spicy surface. Certainly Mahmood put the 149 minutes of defiance he showed alongside Leach in part down to the older ball going soft. Had Mahmood not been dropped on 15, England would have been 149 all out but they at least have a score on the board. That reprieve was also the motivation for the booming straight six off Kyle Mayers that followed the very next delivery. The 25-year-old added: “I had faced 25-30 balls without getting a run then I got dropped and I just thought ‘I’m gonna take this guy down’. Some of the lads got stuck into me for running after I hit that six. It was good fun out there with Leachy, it was a case of being disciplined out there and hitting the bad ball. “If you hear me in the dressing room, I’ll always talk myself up as a batter. But when you come into this environment and you’ve got guys bowling 145-150kph you tend to go quiet a little bit. I’ll try and stay level after this. But it would have been nice to get 50.”",Sport/Sport,Mahmood spurred on after England teammates ‘had the whites on’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/24/mahmood-spurred-on-after-england-teammates-had-the-whites-on
3/25/2022,"With 23 minutes gone there was a moment of uproar inside the Cardiff City Stadium as Harry Wilson was blocked off outside the Austria penalty area; uproar that gave way almost immediately as Szymon Marciniak blew his whistle for the free-kick. Suddenly the air was alive with a weird kind of buzz, like the moment in a storm just before the lightning bolt hits and things start to lift: the hairs on your arms, seats flipped up, people in the stands starting to raise their hands above their heads. Gareth Bale paced it out and waited, charging the moment a little more. There is a concept doing the rounds called “main character energy”. It describes those people who communicate at all times the certainty that whatever might be happening around them, they are the main character in this scene. A way of standing, talking, entering a room. It says: the camera is on me. This is my close-up. Thanks so much for coming. This is quite a handy notion in sport. Main character energy: sports people need this stuff. Although not too much of it. And ideally, you actually are the main character. Welcome to Cardiff, Österreichische Fussballnationalmannschaft. And thanks, really, for coming. Up to that point Bale had touched the ball 12 times. He’d floated a header wide. He’d tried to do some pressing. But was there ever any real doubt, as the ball was spotted and Bale took three paces back, who was doing the voice-over here, the cut-aways? Not that this was ever really going to work. Just look at the theatre of it. One-off game, win or bust. The home crowd hero. His first real sighter. Of course it’s thrilling, of course the crowd rises and stiffens. But people don’t score goals like this. It’s too difficult. It’s also too difficult. The ball was 35 yard or so from goal at an angle. Heinz Lindner had a full wall in place. There was only one spot Bale could put it, and that would require dip, power and perfect accuracy. He’s rusty. It’s early on. Just saying, don’t get your hopes … don’t think that … Oh. Bale took a hop, four steps, then hit the ball with the top of his foot in the familiar style. It wasn’t really a spank or a rocket, but a clip: all about the rhythm and the ping; and let’s just say it, with something of the golf shot. What was strange was the trajectory, the ball leaping, dipping, then travelling on in a flat line like a missile. Lindner stopped and craned his neck to look up as that lovely white orb, picked out in the cold Cardiff lights, grazed the bar and went spinning down in an orderly parabola, a thing of beauty even in that moment of hush before the seats erupted. In the stands people hugged and tumbled over one another. What really lingered was the softness in Bale’s movements: perfect, hard-honed technique executed under pressure, but with an ease that spoke to something spreading back up the foot, the years spent slow-cooking that feeling of team culture, of shared momentum. In that moment Bale really was at home, doing home things. The Cardiff City Stadium had been a slightly angsty place at kick-off. The Welsh anthem – a top three world anthem, up there with France and Italy – was, as ever, a stirring thing. And this World Cup playoff semi-final was a beautifully streamlined piece of staging. No need to consider developments elsewhere. Just win at home, then win the next one too. Fittingly enough for a high‑stakes, one-off casino trip of a game, Robert Page had loaded up every chip and swept it all into play. When it’s win or bust, well, it makes a lot of sense to try for the win. So Page picked a team with all the players. A midfield of Joe Allen, Aaron Ramsey and Wilson was never likely to die wondering. In attack Wales had Bale and Daniel James, one to ferret and press for two men, one to provide the fantasy, the vibes. It did leave them open. On four minutes there was a moment of jaw-drop as Christoph Baumgartner strolled in on goal and saw the ball clang back off the bar. At times here was a large green space at the heart of this Welsh team, Allen trundling gamely around trying to fill the space like a lone forklift truck in an abandoned hanger. Bale did little early on. This is fine. He doesn’t have to do anything, until he does the thing. And on 51 minutes he did it again to make it 2-0. This was a wonderful team move, Ben Davies holding the ball, Bale taking it off his toe, and swinging it back across and into the top corner. Marcel Sabitzer’s shot, deflected in off Davies, made it 2-1 with just under half an hour still to run. James kept passing up the chance to kill the game, but somehow this was always going one way. There is another act to play in this ensemble drama. But for one night only in Cardiff there was no doubt who was playing centre stage.",Sport/Football,Gareth Bale brings main character energy to Wales’s victory over Austria | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/24/gareth-bale-brings-main-character-energy-to-waless-victory-over-austria

3/25/2022,"There is a special corner of Twitter which spends much of its time lamenting the flaws of football in this country. It is referred to – in equal parts affection and frustration – as #SokkahTwitter. This inebriating sphere of pandemonium is a silent-but-deafening concoction of joy, rage, intellectual acuity and utter nonsense. But it is also, almost unanimously, in agreeance on one core belief: player development pathways in Australia are fundamentally flawed. This online conversation would barely register for the many Australians who tune in only to watch the national team play the big games – the matches trumpeted as those that matter. So they buy a ticket or turn on the TV and then, in a flash, are hit with it, overcome by the heat of an oven opened in their faces. As it stands, after Thursday night’s 2-0 defeat to Japan, the Socceroos are hurtling inexorably towards some place other than the World Cup. They are on the road not to Qatar 2022 but an arid oblivion not experienced since the finals in South Korea and Japan 20 years ago. They have just lost a home World Cup qualifier with a result riding on it for the first time since 1981. The casual fan may not hear or read the stream of analyses – #SokkahTwitter or otherwise – dissecting Australia’s performances in many a Fifa window. They come away with only what they have seen in front of them. And perhaps this is not an entirely irrelevant lens through which to consider the Socceroos’ predicament – a mortifying mess which is also confusing because this team which symbolises so much to so many people now looks like bric-a-brac of a past era. There were a couple of positives to appreciate, such as the classy Ajdin Hrustic and, for the most part, Mat Ryan. Viewers certainly would have sighted the hosts’ disallowed first-half goal and deduced that, had it stood, the complexion of the contest might have shifted. Mostly, though, they would have seen Takumi Minamino rip through Australia’s defence and Kaoru Mitoma score a brace in the final minutes. Of course, there are caveats – Australian football loves a caveat. Key players were unavailable for this match and the ones who were played in a manner befitting an XI which has spent little time together on a pitch. There are also viable questions around tactical and selection missteps. There will be further debate about Graham Arnold’s future. Separately, there have already been queries about the wisdom of a Covid-positive head coach walking his dog at the beach instead of isolating at home. Then there is Covid in general – travel restrictions enforced by the pandemic have ensured an even more mentally and physically arduous qualifying route. But at the crux of what has gone awry over the past 15 or so years is the bottleneck of player development. The paucity of opportunities for young, talented footballers to fulfil their potential and a resulting lack of national-team depth. This problem is evident at all levels of the domestic game but it is the most perceptible at the top of the inverted pyramid. The A-League Men has been heavily relied upon to produce high-quality players and yet there remains no solid, collective plan in place for this to occur. The coaches, understandably, prioritise their own teams, an issue compounded by a policy of not breaking for international windows. In 2018, when Arnold was managing Sydney FC, he said “I don’t see the A-League as a development league”. In 2019, after he was appointed Socceroos head coach, he called for the urgent establishment of a national second division or A-League reserves competition so players between the key development ages of 17 and 22 had somewhere to play. Still there is no second division, nor promotion and relegation. The FFA Centre of Excellence, a talent factory for the golden generation, has long been shut down. And it is worth asking whether those golden-generation players, that class of 2006 against whom every performance since has been measured, may have laboured just to break through in this iteration of the domestic league. Would a young Mark Viduka have been given a game? The same goes for Harry Kewell and John Aloisi. Yes, these are examples of attacking players, but the development of local talent in front-third positions has become particularly problematic given clubs are increasingly signing imports as their regular starters in these sexier roles. Primarily because of this, the Socceroos are in a state of paralysis. For years many believed they were punching above their weight, achieving wonderful things against the odds. Years later they should be accomplishing wonderful things but are instead falling demonstrably short as a rapidly developing Asian confederation ploughs full steam ahead. Much of the focus around Australia’s upcoming playoffs has been around the formidable South American tie which now looms as the final hurdle to Qatar. We are getting well ahead of ourselves. Before that is even a consideration Australia must beat the other third-placed team from Group A in a sudden-death playoff. At this stage that is likely to be the United Arab Emirates, who knocked the Socceroos out of the 2019 Asian Cup. And this should be cause for serious introspection. Japan have built a very good team on the back of three decades of development through the J. League. Its model ensures most players have a sound technical foundation at a young age and progress systematically through a pyramid of underage teams, from which J. League sides select their senior squads. The country has set the benchmark for youth development in Asia. Australia’s loss was predictable, and for that it has much to learn.",Sport/Football,The Socceroos are in a state of paralysis.

3/25/2022,"Kyle Walker-Peters will always have Barcelona. “Whenever people ask me about that, I talk about it as the best and worst experience I had,” says the Southampton full-back, who is in the England squad for the first time, preparing for the friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast. Walker-Peters was a 21-year-old Tottenham hopeful in December 2018 when he was thrust into the club’s final Champions League group game at the Camp Nou. It did not start well and he was at fault when Ousmane Dembélé opened the scoring in the seventh minute. At which point Walker-Peters could have gone under. Instead, he dug deeper, using the setback as fuel and growing into the tie, playing his part as Spurs came back to draw 1-1 and advance to the knockout rounds. It is what he does, his career so far defined by an ability to respond in adversity. Walker-Peters had begun the Under-20 World Cup in 2017 as an unused substitute but he finished it as the starting left-back in the England team that lifted the trophy. He could not establish himself as a Premier League player at Spurs; he has done so at Southampton. He was dropped by the then England Under-21 manager, Aidy Boothroyd, for the European Championship in March last year, despite being a regular for him previously. He is now in the senior squad. “Barcelona was an opportunity for me to realise that you’re going to make mistakes but how well can you continue to play?” Walker-Peters says. “I remember Harry Kane and Danny Rose coming over to me after the mistake and saying: ‘You’re playing well, just keep going.’ That gave me so much confidence and I ended up playing a really good game.” Young players will make errors. It is often a question of whether they will be allowed to make them again and it was all rather stop-start for Walker-Peters at Spurs; he made nine league starts across two and a half seasons. “I was competing with two really top players in Kieran Trippier and Serge Aurier,” Walker-Peters says. “I had some really good performances but then I didn’t play again. I looked at it more as a process. I trusted in [the manager, Mauricio] Pochettino and I’ve learned a lot from it.” Walker-Peters jumped at the opportunity to move to Southampton, initially on loan in January 2020, then on a £12m transfer in the summer of that year. He did not want to wait any longer for the chance of more minutes. He felt ready and he has started 57 league matches for Southampton. “The most important thing for me was playing games, getting regular minutes when you can make mistakes and improve from them … that’s the only way you can get better,” the 24-year-old says and, if that sounds a little pointed, then the bit where he is asked about whether he has proved a point to Spurs certainly is. “That’s what I wanted to do. I wanted to go to Southampton because I knew they believed in me. I wanted to play regular football and maybe I’ve proved a few people wrong, which is always nice.” Walker-Peters had been at Spurs since the age of 10. It was a wrench to leave and stepping down from a big-six club to step forward in the longer term was not without its risks. “Definitely,” Walker-Peters says. “But those are the risks you have to take in football if you believe in yourself. I wanted to be a Premier League footballer and to do that you have to play regular games.” Walker-Peters was told on Saturday of his impending England call-up by his manager at Southampton, Ralph Hasenhüttl. The England manager, Gareth Southgate, had named the full-backs Trent Alexander-Arnold and Reece James in his original squad last Thursday but, by now, he knew that neither would be fit. Walker-Peters had to cancel a holiday with friends to Milan. “He [Hasenhüttl] asked me where I was going and then he said: ‘No, you’re not. You’re going away with England!’” Another conversation with Hasenhüttl arguably sowed the seeds for Walker-Peters’ elevation. “He said: ‘If you want to play for England, it’s important you show them you can play on the left as well,” Walker-Peters says. “He said: ‘Look at Trippier. At the Euros, he played left-back some of the time.’ I’d say versatility is definitely a quality that Gareth appreciates.” Known primarily as a right-back, Walker-Peters has starred on the left for Southampton this season. That said, Southgate has used him on the right in training and it could be where he makes his debut. “I feel just as comfortable in either position,” Walker-Peters says. “It was a bit of a surprise to people when I started playing left-back this season but I’ve been doing it for a long time, throughout the England youth ranks – including at the Under-20 World Cup.” Walker-Peters’ mind goes back to the start of his football journey and to the people who have helped him, including his uncle, Phil Walker, a former Millwall and Charlton midfielder. “He played a big part in terms of sharing his experiences,” Walker-Peters says. “He would have been in the same situation of making mistakes and having to bounce back from them.” At 14, Walker-Peters was invited to St George’s Park for the first time to play in a tournament. “I remember actually playing a game on the pitch that we’re now training on,” he says. The circularity of the narrative is a nice detail but, for Walker-Peters, it is all about what happens next.",Sport/Football,Kyle Walker-Peters happy to ‘prove people wrong’ after England call-up,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/24/kyle-walker-peters-england-call-up-southampton
3/25/2022,"The UK government has set a new target to increase the number of electric car chargers more than ten times to 300,000 by 2030 after heavy criticism that the rollout of public infrastructure is too slow to match rapid growth in sales. The Department for Transport (DfT) said it would invest an extra £450m to do so, alongside hefty sums of private capital. Sales of new cars and vans with petrol and diesel engines will be banned from 2030. There were 420,000 pure-electric cars on UK roads at the end of February, according to the comparison website Next Green Car. There were, however, only 29,600 public charge points in the UK on 1 March, according to data company Zap-Map. The £450m local electric vehicle infrastructure fund would focus on charger hubs and on-street chargers, the DfT said. BP also confirmed it would spend £1bn on new UK charger infrastructure as part of its plans to diversify revenues. The company relies overwhelmingly on fossil fuels for its profits, and is under pressure from investors and activists to show how it will reach net zero carbon emissions. Boris Johnson linked the move to electric cars to the push to reduce dependence on foreign fossil fuel supplies. Fuel prices have hit record highs with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine expected to add further to a cost of living crisis because of global reliance on its exports of oil and gas. “Clean transport isn’t just better for the environment, but is another way we can drive down our dependence on external energy supplies,” the prime minister said. The car industry has consistently complained that the government is not doing enough to provide chargers, meaning many customers were holding back from buying battery electric cars for fear of being unable to top up. Sales of electric cars made up 18% of new-car registrations in February, according to the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), a lobby group. London and the south-east of England have better access to public chargers than poorer parts of the UK, although many electric car owners are likely to rely on private chargers at their homes. Car industry bosses responded with relief to the government pledge, which added to previous plans to invest £950m in rapid chargers. However, Mike Hawes, the SMMT’s chief executive, said he wanted binding targets on the charger rollout. “Charging infrastructure must keep pace with the rapid growth of sales of these cars,” he said. “Deployed nationally and at pace, this expansion would give drivers confidence they will be able to charge as easily as they would refuel, wherever they are.” Edmund King, the president of the AA, said: “Whilst great progress has been made, there is still much to do to convince drivers on the number, and importantly reliability, of charge posts.” He said urgent action was also needed to address problems with chargers’ ease of use, which can require separate accounts, and that more work was needed in rural areas to make isolated charging stations feel safer. Access for disabled drivers was also a problem, he said.",News/Politics,UK government vows 10-fold increase in electric car chargers by 2030,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/24/uk-government-vows-10-fold-increase-in-electric-car-chargers-by-2030
