12/10/2021,"A woman has died after being swept away in flood waters in the Snowy Monaro region in New South Wales, as severe thunderstorms hit Sydney. Police said the 37-year-old woman’s body was found on Friday morning, after emergency services were called to Tuross following reports two vehicle occupants, a man and a woman, were trapped by flood waters.  Authorities were told the woman disembarked from the car before being swept away, just after 2.20am on Friday morning. A body was recovered downstream by NSW State Emergency Services. She is yet to be formally identified, although police believe it to be that of the 37-year-old woman. The man was found a short distance from the car, and did not require medical treatment. NSW Police say inquiries into the incident are ongoing. The Bureau of Meteorology issued severe thunderstorm warnings for the Sydney metropolitan area and for parts of the Illawarra on Friday morning, with heavy rainfall triggering flash flooding. Although the Bureau said the storms had somewhat eased by midday, they warned they could redevelop in the afternoon. ⚠️⛈️ Severe Thunderstorm Warning issued for #Sydney Metropolitan & parts of the Illawarra.

In the 24 hours to 9am on Friday, Moruya recorded 209mm, Lake Conjola 204mm and Fisherman’s Repeater 156mm. The Bureau is reporting that Audley, part of the Royal national park in Sydney’s south, recorded 30mm of rain in 30 minutes on Friday morning. Agata Imielska, manager of the ACT and NSW Bureau of Meteorology said the region can expect some relief. “The good news is this low pressure system will continue to move offshore, and as it keeps moving, it will mean we’ll see an easing trend, and a clearing one as well.” “Broadly, moving into the weekend, we’ll see much drier conditions across the state.” The Bureau is not forecasting any rain for NSW up to Thursday next week, a welcome respite after weeks of storms and heavy rainfall. #Sydney Weather Update: heavy rainfall and storms are on their way to Sydney right now.

A woman died in flood waters on Thursday night, after her car was swept from a Brisbane Hungry Jack’s drive-through. Police and emergency services located the car at about 11.15pm on Thursday night, with a 52-year-old man able to be pulled from the vehicle, but his female passenger was unable to escape. She was found deceased in the car. “As they were exiting the drive-through to go back on to Gympie Road, that part of that road was underwater so they’ve driven into the flood water and the force of the flood water has swept them into the creek,” Queensland Police Sergeant Mark Jones said. The incident came after a 75-year-old woman died after her car was washed away in Brisbane’s west, amid extensive flooding across the city’s west and north. Emergency services recovered the woman’s body from the car about 4.40pm on Thursday afternoon. She was the only occupant of the vehicle.

12/10/2021,"Sir Anthony van Dyck’s Portrait of a Woman, JMW Turner’s Walton Bridge and LS Lowry’s painting of David Lloyd George’s birthplace in Manchester are among the dozens of items of cultural importance saved for the nation this year. Thanks to Art Council England’s cultural gifts and acceptance in lieu schemes, the paintings, archives and other items worth £52m have been accepted for the nation and allocated to museums across the UK.  Turner’s watercolour (1825-8), part of one the artist’s most ambitious projects documenting the landscapes of England and Wales, has been permanently allocated to the Ashmolean Museum. It features a shepherd taking his flock of sheep down into the River Thames, a girl carrying pails of water under a yoke and a boy fishing. Flemish baroque artist Van Dyck’s oil painting Portrait of a Woman (1621-27), which was the product of his trips to Italy, and which had a strong impact on Scottish painting of the period, has been allocated to Kelvingrove Art Gallery. The lady, possibly Marchesa Lomellini, is seated in a gold embroidered black dress. Lowry’s painting of Lloyd George’s birthplace, meanwhile, strikes a contrast with the crowded industrial scenes for which the artist is better known. The painting of a solitary house, with half-drawn curtains revealing a vase of dead flowers, is interpreted as conveying the loneliness and isolation the artist felt during his life time. It has been permanently allocated to the Lowry in Salford. Now in its eighth year, the cultural gifts scheme (CGS) enables UK taxpayers to donate important cultural objects to the nation in return for a percentage reduction in tax based on the value of the item donated. This year, this included the sketchbooks of the Mary Fedden, which have been permanently allocated to the Tate, a fine bronze inkstand by Peter Vischer the Younger, which now resides at the Ashmolean Museum, and two intricate collages by the artist John Bingley Garland, known as the Blood Collages, at the Fitzwilliam Museum. A large sculpture by British contemporary artist Phyllida Barlow has also been allocated to Leeds Art Gallery and the Hepworth Wakefield. The acceptance in lieu scheme (AIL) allows those who have an inheritance tax bill to pay it by transferring important cultural, scientific or historic objects to the nation. The scheme was created in Lloyd George’s people’s budget of 1910 and is now administered by Arts Council England, dispersing gifts to galleries across the UK. Highlights include the late Stephen Hawking’s archive and office, which have been allocated to Cambridge University library and the Science Museum respectively, James Tissot’s Quiet, a striking portrait of his lover and muse Kathleen Newton, now housed at National Museums NI Ulster Museum, and a watercolour, Girl with Butterflies, by Frances MacDonald Macnair, an important member of the Glasgow School, which is now at the Hunterian Museum and Gallery. The archive of award-winning illustrator and children’s book author Pat Hutchins now resides at Seven Stories, an exceptional collection of British pop and figurative art formed by celebrated architects MJ Long and Colin “Sandy” St John Wilson is at Pallant House Gallery, and a group portrait of Catherine de’ Medici with her children by the workshop of Francois Clouet has been allocated to Strawberry Hill Collection Trust. Sir Nicholas Serota, chair of Arts Council England, said the schemes played a vital role in ensuring that communities across the nation can enjoy cultural treasures close to where they live. “During these years, a diverse array of unusual and exceptional items have entered public collections throughout the UK, offering lasting inspiration to all for years to come.” Of the items allocated, 70% were acquired by institutions outside London, and more than 80% of the total tax settled was accounted for by objects that have been allocated outside London. Arts minister Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay said it was “wonderful that so many fascinating works have been acquired through the scheme and I’m delighted that the vast majority have gone to institutions outside of London, benefiting museums, galleries and people across the country”.",Arts/Culture,Works by Turner and Lowry gifted to British nation in 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/dec/10/turner-lowry-gifted-uk-nation-2021-arts-council-england
12/10/2021,"Khurram Parvez was a teenager when his grandfather, a civilian, was gunned down by the Indian army. Growing up in Kashmir in the 1990s, he became wearily familiar with such violence but it was an incident he would never forget. Over the next three decades, Parvez defended human rights and documented the alleged violence, torture and enforced disappearances of Kashmiris by Indian armed forces. After he lost a leg in a landmine explosion in 2004, he was instrumental in getting rebel groups to agree to a landmine ban.  It was work that won him international accolades. But last month, in the middle of the night, the 44-year-old was arrested at his home by India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA), the central bureau which investigates terrorism cases, and taken to jail accused of “terror-funding”. It is the latest case to trigger accusations that dissent is being stifled under the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), led by the prime minister, Narendra Modi. But under the shadow of Parvez’s arrest, Modi is one of the world leaders taking part in US president Joe Biden’s Summit for Democracy, which began on Thursday. The Indian prime minister is expected to take a “prominent role”, including giving an address about “democracy commitments”. The law under which Parvez was detained, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), stands accused of being unconstitutional and undemocratic. UAPA, ostensibly a terrorism prevention law, has instead routinely been used by the Modi government to detain those deemed critical of the government, from lawyers and activists to journalists, priests, poets, academics, civil society members, and Kashmiri civilians. The use of the law before Modi’s government came to power in 2014 was negligible. But between 2014 and 2020, 10,552 people have been arrested under UAPA. For those held under the law, it is notoriously difficult to be granted bail, meaning those accused can be left in pre-trial detention for years. In one of the most stark cases, Father Stan Swamy, an 84-year-old Jesuit priest with Parkinson’s disease who was detained for allegedly supporting anti-national activity, died in jail this year after being repeatedly refused bail even on health grounds. In another case, a journalist, Siddique Kappan, has been held under the law for more than a year without bail after being arrested while reporting. Last weekend, Parvez was denied bail and sent to Tihar prison in Delhi after 12 days of custody. Use of the law has risen steeply since 2019 when the government gave authorities the power to designate an individual as a “terrorist”. Last month, when communal violence erupted in the Indian state of Tripura, it was used against lawyers who tried to investigate the attacks, journalists who reported on the destruction of mosques and more than 150 journalists and civilians who tweeted about the incidents. In November, a case was taken to the supreme court challenging the constitutional validity of the law, pointing out that only 2% of UAPA arrests end in conviction, and arguing that “prosecution under the UAPA is either initiated in bad faith, or the quality of the evidence is not sufficient”. “The entire problem with UAPA is the vague definition of unlawful activity,” said Salih Pirzada, a Kashmir-based lawyer. “Anything you do by your actions, words, spoken or otherwise – or even if you only intend or think of doing something – the authorities can bring that under the definition of Unlawful Activities.” The deployment of UAPA has been particularly apparent in Kashmir, a region that has been disputed between India and Pakistan since Indian independence. Kashmir has been home to a long-running violent insurgency fighting Indian rule and as a result has become the world’s most heavily militarised zone. But in August 2019, the BJP government revoked the autonomy that Kashmir previously had for 70 years, and brought it fully under control of the central government. A severe military crackdown on the region followed, which has sharply escalated in recent months. A father who demanded the body of his son who was killed by Indian forces, the players of a cricket match which was organised in memory of a slain militant, and Kashmiris who supported Pakistan in an India-Pakistan cricket match have all had police cases filed against them under UAPA. The arrest of Parvez drew international condemnation. Mary Lawlor, the UN special rapporteur on human rights defenders, tweeted: “He’s not a terrorist, he is a human rights defender.” It also led to calls for UAPA to be amended and brought in line with international human rights law. Human Rights Watch said authorities were “increasingly using the counter-terrorism law against activists, journalists, peaceful protesters and critics to silence dissent”. The UN Office of the High Commissioner (OHCHR) said the law raised “serious concerns relating to the right of presumption of innocence along with other due process and fair trial rights”. India’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Arindam Bagchi, accused the OHCHR of making “baseless and unfounded allegations” and stating that Parvez’s arrest “was done entirely as per provisions of law”. “National security legislations, like the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 (UAPA), were enacted by the parliament to protect the sovereignty of India and ensure security of its citizens,” Bagchi said. It is not the first time Parvez has been targeted. His organisation, Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society (JKCCS), has investigated systematic torture, allegations of rape of civilians by Indian officers, staged gunfights and mass graves, and fought legal battles for victims in Kashmir, making him a thorn in the side of the Indian forces for decades, and in 2016 he was arrested and held for 76 days, until a judge declared his detention illegal and arbitrary. Parvez Imroz, a colleague of Khurram Parvez at JKCCS, said the aim of the arrest was to intimidate. Imroz is now the only member left running the organisation. Their office was first raided by authorities in October 2020, which Imroz believes was the first attempt to harass them. “The purpose was to stop us from doing our work,” he said. “No volunteers are coming here to work due to fear. We used to receive the victims here. But everyone is afraid.”",News/World news,How a terrorism law in India is being used to silence Modi’s critics,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/how-terrorism-law-india-used-to-silence-modis-critics
12/10/2021,"A man attacked by a pack of otters in a Singapore park has said that he thought he was going to die during the ordeal. Graham George Spencer, a British citizen living in Singapore, said he was chased, pinned down and bitten “26 times in 10 seconds” by a family of otters while out for an early morning walk in the botanic gardens.  Spencer told The Straits Times he was approaching the gardens’ entrance on 30 November when he spotted about 20 otters crossing a path in front of him. The animals were moving quietly but “went crazy” after another man ran towards them, Spencer told the paper. The runner was able to avoid the animals but Spencer was not as lucky. He said they lunged at him, biting his ankles, legs and buttocks and causing him to fall over. “I actually thought I was going to die – they were going to kill me,” he added. Spencer’s friend, who was about “15 paces” away from him, ran up screaming in a bid to scare away the otters. “I was bitten 26 times in 10 seconds. If it wasn’t for my friend, I don’t think I’d still be here. I’d be dead,” he told local outlet Today. The pair said they ran towards a visitor centre, still pursued by the otters. After staff at the centre treated some of the wounds, Spencer took himself to nearby Gleneagles hospital where he was given tetanus shots and oral antibiotics. He said he has returned to the hospital three times to treat his wounds. The attack has cost about $1,200 in medical bills. After speaking with a representative from the Singapore Botanic Gardens, Spencer said he was told authorities were investigating the incident. The island is believed to be home to 10 families of otters, or about 90 in total. Driven away by pollution in the 1970s, they have returned as the country’s waterways have been cleaned up in recent years. The Washington Post reports the animals are common sights in hospital lobbies and condominium pools, and have even been seen drinking from public fountains. Although river otters appears benign, the animals have been known to attack people int he past. In May, a 77-year-old man reportedly was bitten on the leg by an otter while exercising near Kallang River in Singapore. Residents of Anchorage, Alaska, were confronted by a pack of aggressive otters in September. A spate of reported incidents saw the group attack dogs, children and adults near creeks, rivers and lakes in the area. Bernard Seah, a member of OtterWatch and the Otter Working Group that track otters in the area surrounding the Singapore Botanic Gardens, said that the family of otters, named the “Zouk family”, were regular visitors to the Gardens and may have bitten Spencer fearing danger. “Given that it was early morning, it may have been dark and confusing for the otters and (Spencer) may have just been a victim of circumstance,” he told the Straits Times. Singapore’s national parks board has issued an advisory on what to do during an encounter with an otter. “DO NOT touch, chase or corner the otters. Observe them from a distance. Going too close to the otters may frighten them,” it says.",News/World news,‘I thought I was going to die’: otters attack British man in Singapore park,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/i-thought-i-was-going-to-die-otters-attack-british-man-in-singapore-park
12/10/2021,"Peter Dutton says buying up to 40 Black Hawk helicopters from the US sends “a very clear message to our partners and to our adversaries” that the Australian Defence Force “can make a significant contribution when we’re called on”. The Australian defence minister explicitly referenced the “growing threat” posed by China as he announced an intention to dump the trouble-plagued MRH90 Taipan helicopters, which were originally due to be withdrawn in 2037.   Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labor reacted to the decision by branding the Morrison government as “the worst national security government in our country’s history” and defence procurement as “an absolute mess”. Australia bought 47 of the Taipans as a replacement for the Black Hawk and Sea King helicopter fleets, but the multi-billion-dollar Howard government-era acquisition has been listed as a “project of concern” since 2011. The entire fleet was grounded in 2019 amid serious concerns about the tail rotor blades and 27 aircraft were grounded last year to fix cabin sliding door rails. Friday’s announcement marks the second major project scrapping on Dutton’s watch, after plans for French-designed conventional submarines were axed in September, although a major difference is that these helicopters are already in service. The helicopters are used by the army – including to provide support to special operations – while the navy also relies on them for maritime support. The Australian government has now formally requested advice from the US on the acquisition of up to 40 UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters for the Australian army “as an alternative platform to the MRH90 Taipan”. Dutton said the Taipans had been found to be “unreliable” and the government would buy up to 40 Black Hawk helicopters. He hoped the new ones would be in service “over the next couple of years”, adding they would not be built or designed in Australia because it was important to “achieve capability sooner than later”. Dutton – who was recently accused of ramping up national security rhetoric for political purposes as a federal election looms – said Australia could only deter “catastrophic outcomes” from “a position of strength”. “I’ve been very clear about what I see as a growing threat within the Indo-Pacific, and I want the Australian Defence Force to have at its disposal the most effective equipment and the most highly trained people to deal with that reality,” Dutton said. Dutton said Japan, India, European countries and Nato were also “worried about the military buildup by the Chinese government”. The defence minister said last month it would be “inconceivable” that Australia wouldn’t come to Taiwan’s aid if the US joined a military effort to defend the democratically governed island against an invasion by China. That prompted a top Chinese diplomat to warn Australian politicians against “doing anything that’s destructive to our relationship”. China has sought to portray the Aukus deal – in which the US and the UK plan to help Australia acquire at least eight nuclear-propelled submarines to be operational from about 2040 – as an “Anglo-Saxon clique”. In another sign of Australia drawing closer to the US, Dutton acknowledged the Black Hawk was “interoperable with our counterparts and with our allies” and was “the favoured platform in the United States”. Dutton, a significant conservative figure in government ranks who has signalled interest in leading the Liberal party when Morrison retires, foreshadowed that the government would announce “many other” defence-related decisions “in the coming months”. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, noted the helicopter decision was made by the cabinet’s entire national security committee, of which Dutton is a member. “The Taipans weren’t meeting their marks – simple as that,” Morrison said at a media conference in Sydney. “That’s a decision that we’ve taken together as a national security committee to ensure that we’re keeping Australians safe.” Labor’s deputy leader, Richard Marles, told reporters: “Defence procurement is an absolute mess and they have been in power now for eight years – it is on them.” In a statement, Labor frontbenchers Brendan O’Connor and Pat Conroy said: “Under the Morrison-Joyce government, 25 major defence projects are running cumulatively 68 years late, meaning ADF personnel are not getting the equipment and platforms they need to do their jobs.” Dutton played down the costs of abandoning the Taipans early, saying, “we will see savings of about two and a half billion dollars” between now and 2037 “because the Black Hawk is so much cheaper on a per hour basis to run”. The defence department has previously estimated the total cost of the MRH90 Taipan program would be $15bn by the time the helicopters were due to be withdrawn from service in 2037, including $3.7bn for the purchase and $11.3bn to sustain them. In October last year, defence officials conceded the door was not wide enough to enable the safe exit of personnel from the helicopter while it was firing. The Australian National Audit Office previously found “significant implications” from the Howard government’s decision in 2004 to approve the acquisition of the MRH90 aircraft, instead of the initial defence department recommendation for Black Hawks.",News/Australia news,Australia to dump Taipan helicopters and buy Black Hawks from US amid China fears,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/10/australia-to-dump-taipan-helicopters-and-buy-black-hawks-from-us-amid-china-fears
