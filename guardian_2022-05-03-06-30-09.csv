5/3/2022,"Boris Johnson will hail Ukraine’s resistance against tyranny as an exemplar for the world as he delivers a virtual address to the country’s parliament on Tuesday. Recalling Britain’s resolve during the second world war, the UK prime minister will say that “we remember our time of greatest peril as our finest hour”. He will say the bravery demonstrated by those who have sought to defend their country from Russian invaders means the war will come to be known as Ukraine’s “finest hour”, too. The speech to Ukrainian MPs reciprocates the move made by the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who gave a historic speech to the House of Commons in March. Johnson will become the first world leader to address the Verkhovna Rada since the conflict began, and seek to show critics he is focused on international affairs despite continuing questions over his leadership. Meanwhile, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has faced fresh questions from Labour about why a company his wife holds a stake in, Infosys, is still reportedly operating in Russia despite assurances it would pull out of the country. The Indian tech company said it would shut its office in Moscow after the invasion of Ukraine and ministers have urged British businesses to cease trading in Russia to help stymie its economy and avoid feeding Vladimir Putin’s war chest. With Russia attempting to focus its attention on the south and eastern regions of Ukraine after failing to take the capital, Kyiv, Johnson will attempt to provide a morale boost. He will tell the Ukrainian parliament: “When my country faced the threat of invasion during the second world war, our parliament – like yours – continued to meet throughout the conflict, and the British people showed such unity and resolve that we remember our time of greatest peril as our finest hour. “This is Ukraine’s finest hour, an epic chapter in your national story that will be remembered and recounted for generations to come. Your children and grandchildren will say that Ukrainians taught the world that the brute force of an aggressor counts for nothing against the moral force of a people determined to be free.” Johnson visited Kyiv last month and other senior western politicians have been to the city recently as well, including the US House of Representatives speaker, Nancy Pelosi. Sunak was urged by Labour to say when Infosys’s Russian office would close down and if his family was financially benefiting from the company’s continued presence there. His wife, Akshata Murty, holds about a 0.9% share in the company, which was founded by her father. Tulip Siddiq, the shadow economic secretary to the Treasury, said it was “really important that the chancellor clarifies what is happening here and whether his immediate family is benefiting from Infosys’s continued presence in Russia”. She added: “We can’t have a situation where a UK chancellor and his family maintain economic interests in the Putin regime.” A spokesperson for Sunak declined to comment. A spokesperson for Murty said she was “one of many minority shareholders and has no involvement in the operational decisions of the company” and added: “This is a matter for Infosys and should be addressed to them.” An Infosys spokesperson said: “While the company does not have any active relationships with local Russian enterprises, we have a small team of fewer than 100 employees in Russia, which services some of our global clients. We are currently working closely with those clients that are being impacted to enable a smooth transition.”",News/World news,Boris Johnson to hail Ukraine’s ‘finest hour’ in address to Kyiv parliament ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/02/ukraine-finest-hour-boris-johnson-virtual-address-kyiv-parliament
5/3/2022,"The largest active wildfire in the US has forced thousands from their homes in New Mexico, as unusually fast-spreading blazes dot the drought-stricken south-west. The blaze, dubbed the Calf Canyon fire, has consumed more than 121,000 acres (49,000 hectares), or more than half the area of New York City, tearing through centuries-old settlements and vacation homes in forested mountains 30 miles (48km) north-east of Santa Fe. The blaze is burning in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains near the small city of Las Vegas, where evacuation orders have been issued, along with several other New Mexican villages. Fire officials said they expect the blaze to keep growing, putting the fire on track to be one of the most destructive in the state’s recorded history. Fierce winds have blown embers beyond the fire, allowing it to breach containment lines set by about 1,000 firefighters backed by aircraft and bulldozers. “This emerging situation remains extremely serious and refusal to evacuate could be a fatal decision,” said the office of emergency management of San Miguel county, where Las Vegas is located. The Calf Canyon fire is the largest of about a dozen major fires in the south-west spurred by strong winds and parched conditions. Scientists say the climate crisis is turning wildfires into a year-round risk for much of the US west, with high temperatures drying out soils and turning vegetation into kindling. More than a million acres have already burned across the US since the start of this year, more than double the total for the same period last year, according to the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC). “Climate change is taking a situation that would be bad for us normally,” said Gregg Garfin, a climatologist at the University of Arizona, “and turning the dial up”. The Calf Canyon fire started on 6 April when a prescribed burn set by firefighters to clear out small trees and brush that can fuel fires spun out of control. The blaze merged with another fire a week ago. In north-west Las Vegas, families packed trucks with boxes of photos and heirlooms and loaded livestock onto trailers, heeding police warnings for residents to get out of the area. David Lopez, 31, chose to stay and defend his family’s two trailer homes, wetting down the earth with a hose and raking away dead grass to create a fire break. “This is all I have – I worked really hard for it,” said the 31-year-old mechanic, who said he planned to flee once flames got within a quarter of a mile of him. Samuel Coca, general manager of a bar in the town’s Castañeda hotel, told the New York Times he had packed his belongings in case he and his family needed to flee and had also met others who had to leave more quickly. “The first dozen people I spoke with lost everything,” Coca said. “They lost their houses, their ranches, some livestock. It was hard to get through the afternoon without crying.” High temperatures and erratic winds kept the fire spreading at “dangerous speeds and in different directions,” the Santa Fe national forest, administered by the US Forest Service, said in an alert. “This is a long-term event and we don’t anticipate having ‘control’ of this fire any time soon,” it said, adding that strong winds were expected most days for the next two weeks. As fire approached from the north and west, the university town of 14,000 staggered evacuations, with another 4,000 to 5,000 people on standby to go, said San Miguel deputy county manager Jesus Romero. The state psychiatric hospital in Las Vegas evacuated 197 patients to other facilities, the New Mexico health department tweeted. The fire has so far destroyed hundreds of properties and forced the evacuation of dozens of settlements in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, but there have been no reports of fatalities.",News/US news,Thousands flee New Mexico wildfire as blaze breaches containment lines,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/02/new-mexico-wildfire-calf-canyon-thousands-flee
5/3/2022,"Welcome to the world of DI Rachita Ray (Parminder Nagra), ITV’s newest cop. We meet her in the local shop choosing what to have for her tea – until a mentally disturbed man with a knife runs past and out into the square. As she runs to catch up with him, while calling in the armed response unit, he stabs a police officer. She manages to talk him into giving up the weapon without further loss of life and, as a reward, is promoted to the role of detective inspector of the homicide division. Life would be sweet for the ambitious DI if it hadn’t, over the preceding 10 minutes, shown how laced with racism it is for a person of colour at every turn. Sometimes, they are moments of othering – the customer in the shop who assumes she is an assistant not a customer, for example – that disrupt what should be the easy flow of daily life. Sometimes, they are even larger, such as the fact that she has been overlooked for promotion until her public heroic act brings her inescapably to the attention of the top brass, and that even the promotion when it does come is tainted by apparent tokenism. “Where are you from?” her unofficial interviewer asks her after the bravery award ceremony. “Leicester,” she replies. “What’s your heritage?” he inevitably responds. Punjab on her mother’s side and Bengal on her father’s. “I think,” adds Ray. “You’re exactly what we need right now,” he says, pleased to have found the right tick for the right box. When she turns up for her first day, the receptionist hands her a lanyard for another Asian person. The receptionist at least is abashed. Her DCI, Gemma Whelan (recently DS Sarah Collins in The Tower), is less so. Ray has been brought in to captain the investigation into a presumed CSH – “culturally specific homicide” of an Asian man (otherwise known as an “honour killing”. The term CSH was invented by the writer, but I will place good money on it being adopted force-wide within the year). How much of her animus towards Ray is fuelled by the subordinate’s “hero moment” and how much by her skin colour “allowing” her this opportunity is one of the many tangled motivations that hold the viewers’ interest. If I’m making it sound heavy-handed by massing so many incidents together, I apologise. It’s not, at all. Despite the wealth of material writer Maya Sondhi (best known for playing police constable Maneet Bindra in Jed Mercurio’s Line of Duty) doubtless has at her disposal, it is used in the service of giving us a police procedural with a fresh perspective rather than didactically. It lends heft to a story that at times moves a bit too slowly – not helped by a similar energy from Nagra that she brought to ER as Dr Rasgotra, who trailed clouds of non-specific misery behind her for six years – and feels a bit too by-numbers to stick to its own terms. Ray has the obligatory semi-troubled private life (she’s engaged to a white fellow officer – but with reservations, as demonstrated by the ring she stows in the glove compartment before she starts work), the obligatory battle with her DCI to dig deeper into the case rather than charge the nearest subjects, and a lot of static time spent spelling out instructions and situations to underlings for the benefit of viewers (who, by this stage in our police procedural consumption history, could probably all start tomorrow without the need for any formal training). The pace picks up as we get further into the case (it was a good decision to strip the whole thing across four nights). Ray soon suspects it is not the CSH the largely white unit had assumed it to be when presented with the death of a brown Muslim man and the disappearance of his Hindu girlfriend, but an eruption of a business rivalry between car firms (“Just shit limos for people who want to be extra,” says his former girlfriend, Nadia, in the opening episode’s best line) and a pointer to a web of underground criminal activity. Ray ends the episode being coshed from behind, but don’t worry – I’ve looked ahead and she is soon back on her doggedly determined game and will have the whole thing wrapped up by Thursday.",Arts/Television & radio,"DI Ray review – like Line of Duty, but with racism at every turn",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/02/di-ray-review-like-line-of-duty-but-with-racism-at-every-turn
5/3/2022,"Nearly a quarter of a century after breaking one sprinting world record as a mere 76-year-old, Lester Wright was back in form again on Saturday as he set the official 100m world record for centenarians. Wright was competing at the Penn Relays, America’s oldest track and field meet, when he surged over the line in a time of 26.34 seconds, breaking Donald Pellmann’s mark of 26.99 set in 2015. Britain’s Fauja Singh set an unofficial 100m world record for the age group in 2011 with a time of 23.40.

He started sprinting seriously in the 1930s before he was forced to pause due to the second world war. He served in a segregated unit on the beaches of Normandy and the Battle of the Bulge under George Patton, and was promoted to sergeant by the end of the war. When he returned to the US he started running again seriously at the age of 30 and has been competing ever since. He broke the 200m world record for over 75s when he was 76.

He and his wife, Adele, have been married 80 years. They ran a dental supply business for 40 years in New Jersey as well as training together and raising a family that includes their great-great grandchildren. “We bowled together, we ran together, we played together, we went to the movies together,” Wright told ABC 7. Wright was asked if he and Adele had a perfect marriage: “No,” he said with a laugh. Asked by ABC 7 what she thinks of her husband’s sporting career, Adele said: “It’s up to him. If he wants to do it, that’s what he wants to do.” Wright said his wife had given him valuable advice before Saturday’s race: “My wife tells me finish your own race.” He may be back to break more records too. Asked if he would compete at the Penn Relays in 2023 Wright replied with a chuckle: “Perhaps”.",Sport/Sport,‘I don’t run to be second’: WW2 veteran smashes centenarian 100m world record,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/02/lester-wright-100m-world-record-100-year-old-age-group
5/3/2022,"Israel has summoned the Russian ambassador and demanded an apology over remarks by the Kremlin foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, that Adolf Hitler “had Jewish blood” and that the “most rabid antisemites tend to be Jews”. The remarks were part of Lavrov’s defence of Russia’s policy of “denazification” in Ukraine, the Kremlin’s term for a sweeping purge that Ukraine says is a pretext for “mass murder.” In an interview with Italian TV, Lavrov was asked to address how Russia could say it needed to “denazify” the country when its president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is Jewish. “As to [Zelenskiy’s] argument of what kind of nazification can we have if I’m Jewish, if I remember correctly, and I may be wrong, Hitler also had Jewish blood,” Lavrov said during an interview with Italian television channel Mediaset. “It doesn’t mean anything at all.” “We have for a long time listened to the wise Jewish people who say that the most rabid antisemites tend to be Jews,” Lavrov continued. “There is no family without a monster.” The remarks have sparked a diplomatic row with Israel, one of the few western countries that has yet to impose sanctions on Russia over its invasion and has not provided military aid to Ukraine. “His words are untrue and their intentions are wrong,” said the Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett. “Using the Holocaust of the Jewish people as a political tool must cease immediately.” Yair Lapid, Israel’s foreign minister, said Israel made “every effort” to have good relations with Russia “but there is a limit and this limit has been crossed this time. The government of Russia needs to apologise to us and the Jewish people.” He said: “Foreign Minister Lavrov’s remarks are both an unforgivable and outrageous statement as well as a terrible historical error. Jews did not murder themselves in the Holocaust. The lowest level of racism against Jews is to accuse Jews themselves of antisemitism.” Israeli officials confirmed Russia’s ambassador, Anatoly Viktorov, had been summoned to the foreign ministry and Israel had “stated its position”. In his nightly video address, Zelenskiy said Lavrov’s comments showed that Moscow has forgotten, or never learned, the lessons of the second world war. “No one has heard any denial or any justification from Moscow. All we have from there is silence … this means that the Russian leadership has forgotten all the lessons of world war two,” he said. “Or perhaps they have never learned those lessons.” World leaders also condemned the remarks, which the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, described as “obscene” and Canada’s Justin Trudeau said were “ridiculous and unacceptable.” Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskiy, called Lavrov’s statement “antisemitic” and said that it was “further evidence that Russia is the legal successor of Nazi ideology”. “Trying to rewrite history, Moscow is simply looking for arguments to justify the mass murders of Ukrainians,” he said. Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust memorial, also condemned Lavrov’s remarks as “absurd, delusional, dangerous and deserving of condemnation”. The organisation in March had also attacked Zelenskiy for comparing Russia’s intentions in Ukraine to the Holocaust. Lavrov has addressed Zelenskiy’s religion in the past as Moscow has been pressed to explain how it can “denazify” a country with a Jewish leader. In March, shortly after Russia began its war in Ukraine, Lavrov told US broadcaster ABC News: “I think the Nazis and neo-Nazis manipulate [Zelenskiy].” In his interview this week, Lavrov also said he did not want Ukraine to surrender but simply that it “stop resisting”. “We don’t demand that [Zelenskiy] surrender,” Lavrov said. “We demand that he give the order to release all civilians and stop resisting. Our goal does not include regime change in Ukraine.” Italy’s Mediaset TV channel also came under fire for giving space to Lavrov, with Enrico Letta, the leader of the centre-left Democratic party, describing the exclusive interview on the current affairs programme Zona bianca as “a propaganda advert”. Laura Garavani, a senator with the small Italia Via party, said the interview, conducted by Giuseppe Brindisi, “was an offensive spectacle for a democracy like ours. The network acted as a sounding board for Russian propaganda by letting Lavrov speak undisturbed, denying the crimes he is committing without any cross-examination”. Ruth Dureghello, the president of the Jewish Community of Rome, said Lavrov’s statements were “delusional and dangerous”, and that their most serious aspect was that they were made “on Italian television, without any cross-examination and without the presenter opposing the lies that were uttered”. “This is unacceptable and cannot be allowed to pass by in silence,” she added.",News/World news,Israel summons Russia envoy over minister’s Hitler comments ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/02/israel-summons-russia-envoy-sergei-lavrov-hitler-comments
