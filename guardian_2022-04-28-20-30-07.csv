Terence She told me she was in the NHS. We probably had similar views on that, from a different angle. Liz He wants to preserve it as well – that was a big one. If we’d disagreed, that’s all we’d have talked about. Terence I openly said: “I don’t agree with these migrants who are coming across the Channel from France.” To me, in the main, the people doing this are fit gentlemen of a youngish age, who should be back home helping to defend wherever they come from, or helping to make it better. Liz He was all: “You make your own luck in this world” and I said,“What about these people in dinghies? They’re taking a risk. They’re making their own luck.” But he couldn’t see it.

He’s of the mindset that if people are genuinely fleeing conflict, they should be welcomed in. Terence From Liz’s point of view, and probably from mine, the NHS has been underfunded for about 10 years. But it’s been underfunded for the past 20 years, by successive governments, not just Conservatives. It was Tony Blair who introduced privatisation as well. Liz We talked about a two-tier private system – if the private sector cherrypicks the routine operations, the NHS is left with the difficult stuff. So we agreed on that. Terence It’s like a perennial football – if the government changes, the NHS changes. It needs cross-party consensus so that you can get a proper plan to go forward. Liz We both wanted more money for frontline staff. I agreed it should be less political. There’d be less need for management. Because the systems change so often, and it’s all about making things as cheap as possible, there’s a lot of unnecessary expense. Liz I brought up the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill, and how peaceful protest is being outlawed. I don’t think he was aware of the legislation. I said,“It’s about peaceful protest. And if you ban peaceful protest, what are people going to start doing to get their point across?” Terence Protesters stopping normal people going about their business, going to work to support their family, because people are playing silly buggers, that is out of order. Liz It wasn’t helpful that the Insulate Britain movement emerged just as the bill was going through. The timing of it, and the persistent targeting of the same areas, causing people to become so much more angry: that seems to me like the kind of tactic that would turn people against peaceful protest.

4/28/2022,"Ivery much enjoyed Ten Percent (Amazon Prime Video), the pleasant English-language remake of the French hit Call My Agent!, but it did seem to be rather pointless. Much of it is a straightforward remake of the French series, so fans will be familiar with storylines about two big-name stars being given the same role, for example, or another finding out she is considered too old for a leading Hollywood movie. It is not so much inspired by the original as it is borrowing its clothes, car and house. Call My Agent!’s Agence Samuel Kerr talent agency is rebranded as Nightingale Hart, near Goodge Street, an area of London that doesn’t quite have the same visual appeal as the 1st arrondissement. Otherwise, it’s all as expected. There’s a Mathias (Jack Davenport’s Jonathan), an Andrea (Lydia Leonard, as Rebecca), a Gabriel (Prasanna Puwanarajah, now Dan) and an Arlette (an underused Maggie Steed, as Stella). There are the same assistants, the same family members, the same actor types. As well as its conceit and several of its plots, it also shares some of the original’s jaunty spirit and bounce. Ten Percent is written by John Morton, who satirised inane corporate buffoonery in both Twenty Twelve and W1A, though considering his calibre and experience, the satirical side of this show is oddly toothless. Actors sending themselves up should be funny, and on occasion, it manages to get there. Dominic West is fun as a precious West End Hamlet struggling to get to grips with an Ivo van Hove-esque screen-heavy production, and David Harewood thunders in at the end to run away with the finale. But more often than not, it plays it too safe. Actors make fun of the business – it’s ageist! It’s full of massive egos! – but not themselves. It’s nice to see famous faces like Helena Bonham Carter and Himesh Patel, but there’s surprisingly little to no self-deprecation here. For a British version, it seems like an omission, or a missed opportunity. There are some twists and upgrades that really work. Who will be the next Bond? Why have a tax inspector when she could be a foreign correspondent instead? Americans meddle in the business quickly and completely, and it seems much more at ease when mocking bland Californian business platitudes than when teasing the world its performers inhabit. “You guys are so British,” beams one particularly high-wattage American newcomer. “Thank God someone is,” says Stella, the old hand who has been in the business for ever. This exchange sums up the mood of the series. It seems to say that there’s a stuffy old English way of doing things, and we like it like that. This is why, I think, the agents are all too nice. They occasionally make a phonecall behind each other’s backs, but they are not nearly cutthroat enough. They are all too moral, even Rebecca and Jonathan, despite their dastardly provenance. When it embraces its soapiness, it cajoles you into caring about the characters in the same way the French version did, but underneath the froth and fun, there is a strong undercurrent of melancholy. A washed-up, troubled actor called Simon Gould (Tim McInnerny) haunts proceedings, hanging around like a living prompt for other characters’ biggest fears, as filtered through his own failures. It is a strange choice, and he feels as if it belongs to a different series. If Ten Percent seems, on occasion, too deferential to the showbiz world, this is its luvviest concession. It made me pine for some spiky humour to cut through the fog of these teachable moments, as the Americans might call them. Yet despite my misgivings, I somehow managed to plough through the entire series with gusto. I suspect that viewers who have not seen the French original may get more out of this, as the agents’ storylines, about secret daughters and reluctant love affairs and buyouts and sell-offs, have a heightened sense of melodrama that is rarely seen on British television. It’s amusing to view Lorraine and The One Show in a dramatic setting, and it is also extremely enjoyable to see which British actors, old and new, can pull off playing themselves. On occasion, this seems like a bigger ask than you might think. Is there any point to this? Not really. But by the end, was I invested in Nightingale Hart? I was, and I hope that if it returns, it does so with more confidence in what it can do when it stands alone, without the Parisian office breathing down its neck.",Arts/Television & radio,Ten Percent review – a perfectly pleasant if pointless remake of Call My Agent! ,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/28/ten-percent-review-a-perfectly-pleasant-if-pointless-remake-of-call-my-agent
4/28/2022,"Energy companies in Europe are considering opening Russian accounts to pay for gas from Gazprom after Vladimir Putin’s regime cut off supplies to Poland and Bulgaria and insisted other countries must pay in roubles. Major gas distributors in Germany and Austria confirmed they were seeking ways to continue to make payments after Putin signed a decree at the end of March calling for a a “special procedure for foreign buyers’ fulfilment of obligations to Russian suppliers of natural gas”. The decree stipulates that non-Russian buyers of gas must open special “K” type rouble and foreign currency accounts at Gazprombank, the third-largest bank in Russia. Gazprombank was set up to be a key service provider to Gazprom, the state-owned gas producer which has a monopoly on exports via gas pipelines to Europe. German distributor Uniper and Austria’s OMV confirmed they were considering how to comply with the decree. The Financial Times reported that companies in Hungary and Slovakia as well as Italy’s Eni were also considering signing up for the accounts in the hope of securing continued supplies, despite a warning from the European Commission that doing so could breach sanctions. Poland and Bulgaria have taken a defiant position, refusing to sign up to Putin’s preferred arrangement. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, described Russia’s retaliatory suspension of gas supplies to the country as a “direct attack”. However, Germany, Europe’s largest economy and largest Russian gas user, has adopted a more emollient tone amid fears – disputed by some analysts – that an embargo would be impossible without crashing its economy. A spokesman for Uniper, one of Germany’s main buyers of gas from Russia, on Thursday confirmed it was in talks with Gazprom “in close coordination with the German government” over “concrete payment modalities”, but that it would continue to pay in euros for now. “Uniper can say for its contracts: we consider a payment conversion compliant with sanctions law and the Russian decree to be possible,” the spokesman said. “For our company and for Germany as a whole, it is not possible to do without Russian gas in the short term; this would have dramatic consequences for our economy.” OMV, an Austrian oil and gas company, is also looking at ways to pay for gas without contravening EU sanctions. In a statement OMV said: “We have analysed the Gazprom request about payment methods in light of the EU sanctions and are now working on a sanctions compliant solution.” European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday said the Kremlin was using “fossil fuels to try to blackmail us”, and that the EU was seeking to reduce its reliance on Russian gas by importing more from the US. However, the EU has not moved to impose sanctions on Gazprom or Gazprombank. Bloomberg News on Wednesday reported that four European companies have paid in roubles, citing a person close to Gazprom, while another 10 have opened accounts. Under the arrangement demanded by Russia, gas would be paid for in euros – the currency in which contracts were written – and those euros would be sold on the Moscow exchange for roubles, which would then be transferred to Gazprom. The extra demand for roubles would help to sustain the currency, helping importers in Russia’s economy, which has been hit hard by the war and the economic isolation resulting from sanctions imposed by many other major countries. Eni was approached for comment.",News/Business,European energy firms seek ways to comply with Putin gas payment decree,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/28/european-energy-firms-seek-ways-to-comply-with-putin-gas-payment-decree
4/28/2022,"The UN secretary general has described the war in Ukraine as “an absurdity” in the 21st century on a visit to the scene of civilian killings outside Kyiv, as Russia warned the west that increasing arms supplies to Ukraine would endanger European security. António Guterres was touring Borodianka, where Russian forces are accused of massacring civilians before their withdrawal, on his first visit on Thursday to Ukraine since the 24 February invasion, before talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “I imagine my family in one of those houses that is now destroyed and black,” said the UN secretary general, who has been criticised for visiting Ukraine only after having first met Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, in Moscow. “I see my granddaughters running away in panic,” Guterres said. “The war is an absurdity in the 21st century. The war is evil. There is no way a war can be acceptable in the 21st century.” Gutteres was accompanied by local military and civilian governors who showed him residential buildings that had been destroyed in Russian attacks. He was also due to visit the towns of Bucha and Irpin, sites of further alleged Russian war crimes. The Kremlin’s official spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, warned on Thursday that an increased western supply of heavy weapons to Kyiv – as urged by the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, on Wednesday – would endanger European security. “The tendency to pump weapons, including heavy weapons, into Ukraine, these are the actions that threaten the security of the continent, provoke instability,” Peskov said in response to Truss’s call for Kyiv’s allies to “ramp up” military production, including tanks and planes, to help Ukraine. Maria Zakharova, Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, also warned the west on Thursday to stop encouraging Ukraine to strike at targets inside Russian territory, saying it was “trying our patience”. Multiple targets, including fuel and ammunition depots, have been hit in Russian provinces bordering Ukraine in recent days. “Such aggression against Russia cannot remain without an answer,” Zakharova said. “We would like Kyiv and western capitals to take seriously the statement that further provocation prompting Ukraine to strike against Russian facilities will be met with a harsh response from Russia.” Zakharova added that western envoys in Ukraine would not be immune from Russian retaliatory attacks, saying “advisers from western countries” in Ukraine “will not necessarily be a problem for Russia’s response measures”. The senior Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak defended Ukraine’s right to strike inside Russian, saying: “Ukraine will defend itself in any way, including strikes on the warehouses and bases of the killers in Russia. The world recognises this right.” Britain’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, on Thursday also repeated the UK’s assertion that it was “legitimate under international law” for Ukrainian forces to target Russian logistics infrastructure, but he said such attacks were unlikely to use British weapons. He also denied Nato was locked in a “proxy war” with Russia, but said the west would provide increasing support to Ukraine if the Russian attacks continued. “Sometimes that will include planes and tanks,” he said, adding that he expected Putin, “having failed in nearly all his objectives to dig in “like a cancerous growth”. Germany’s parliament on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a petition backing the delivery of weapons, including heavy arms, to Ukraine to help it fend off Russian attacks. As Russia’s assault on Ukraine, now in its 10th week, continues to radically reshape security and economic ties across Europe, Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said non-aligned Finland and Sweden would be welcome in the alliance. “It is, of course, for Finland and Sweden to decide whether they would like to apply for membership in Nato or not,” Stoltenberg said on Thursday. “But if they decide to apply, Finland and Sweden will be welcomed with open arms.” Nordic media said this week the two countries, which are deliberating the question of Nato membership, had agreed to submit simultaneous applications to the US-led alliance in mid-May. Moscow has said that would force it to bolster its defences in the Baltic, including with nuclear weapons, to “restore balance”. While Russia presses its military offensive in eastern and southern Ukraine, its economic battle with the west threatens to disrupt gas supplies to Europe. In a retaliatory strike against western sanctions, Moscow on Wednesday halted gas deliveries to Poland and Bulgaria for refusing to pay for supplies in roubles, a move Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, called “blackmail”. Zelenskiy repeated the term in an overnight national address, saying Moscow’s “European energy blackmail” showed it considered “not only gas, but any trade as a weapon” and that “no one in Europe can hope to maintain any normal economic cooperation with Russia”. The Financial Times, however, reported that some of Europe’s largest gas importers in Germany, Austria, Hungary and Slovakia were preparing to pay for their supplies in roubles via accounts with Russia’s Gazprombank . The commission has warned this would undercut the EU’s sanctions and endanger the bloc’s unity.",News/World news,UN secretary general describes war in Ukraine as ‘absurdity’ in 21st century,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/28/un-secretary-general-describes-war-in-ukraine-as-absurdity-in-21st-century
4/28/2022,"You hear it all the time, the question: “When did you know you were trans?” The question should really be: “When did I know that the rest of the world didn’t behave in the same way as I did?” When I came out at 14, more than 30 years ago, my mother thought I was gay and confused. She thought that if I could just learn to pee standing up and toughened up a bit, there wouldn’t be a problem. And so she tried to get me “help”. She approached a church group which was, as far as I could tell, a coffee morning for Catholics. They advised her to get the parish priest to see me, who suggested these weekend retreats run by a commune that would, he said, “sort me out”. I was happy to go at first. I knew there was a problem and when you’re 14 and adults say they are there to support and help you, you believe them. But I quickly realised that they were not there to help me – they were there to condition me. I would get there on a Friday evening, in time for mass. I would have food, and then it was time for prayer, which went on until 1am. Then I’d be allowed to go to sleep, but I had to be up for 6am for another mass. The lack of sleep was deliberate – to make you more compliant. It’s simple – if you’re tired, you’re more likely to agree to things. After morning mass, I’d sit for hours and hours in an office with someone talking at me. And I genuinely mean talk at me, I never got to speak. “You’re not gay, you’re not gay,” they said repeatedly. “Why do you think you’re gay?” They tried to convince me that being gay was a terrible choice. I told them that I wasn’t gay, it was my sexuality that I was in conflict with – my gender identity, or what I now call it: that I was transgender. But they didn’t understand it. They said I was a straight man. They were determined that through prayer, through these long talks, that I would reach a kind of holy conversion. But that was just never going to happen. So I just shut down. Over time, I became withdrawn. To be told for hours at a time that what you say is wrong, you learn that it’s better to say nothing at all. It went on like this for three years. I didn’t have anybody to help me – and I started to believe that, actually, they might be right. I collapsed mentally – I was doubting my gender, my sexuality, my own mind. I bombed out of school and became a kitchen porter. But even then, for some reason, I took myself to that place every weekend. It’s a similar process to grooming – it happens slowly and incrementally. By the time you realise just how bad it is, it’s too late – you’ve been conditioned, so you go, because you have nothing else. A sous chef at work noticed a pattern: at the beginning and end of the working week, I’d be sullen and uncommunicative. Wednesdays were the days I would talk to people. It took him two months, but after a while I trusted him enough to tell him what was going on at the weekends. He helped me realise that this wasn’t how I should be living. He got me a job in Spain collecting glasses in an LGBT bar, and paid for my ticket there – he told me to go and figure out who I was. I spent five years in Spain and my gender expression changed greatly. Eventually, I was essentially living in a feminine role and was treated so by the people around me because it was an LGBT bar. But that came to an end. When I was 21, I met someone, a woman, and we got married and I went back to playing the part as the guy. Later, I got married again, to another woman. I never told anyone about the other part of my life – about being trans and going to “conversion therapy”. I kept it all bottled up. My confidence had been absolutely smashed. The “conversion therapy” messes up your ability to have relationships with people and you’re also left with sexual hangups because you’re so confused. I was playing a part because I didn’t have the confidence to say: “This isn’t me.” My mental health unravelled – by the time I was 45 I reached a breaking point and my wife sat me down and demanded to know what was going on. I just put my head on the table and said: “I’m trans.” Now, recalling the conversation, she says: “I came to the conclusion that you weren’t lying to me. You were lying to yourself.” And that’s exactly what happened, thanks to this conditioning. I believed that I could play a role – and I couldn’t. The suicide attempts for trans people is statistically very, very high. I attempted it, multiple times. In 1991, 1993, 1995, 1998 and 2022. I don’t want anyone to go through what I went through. It’s a form of torture and it must be banned. While the government has banned conversion practices for gay people, it has not done so for trans people. If people say they are trans, we need to believe them. And then genuine therapy can begin where they can explore their identities. I know first-hand that “conversion therapy” doesn’t work. But it does destroy people’s self-worth, pick them apart, mentally make them doubt themselves, make them confused. There is no set of guidelines for trans conversion practices, there is no manual, no Nice clinical guidance. These so-called “therapists” have no idea what they are doing. Trans people should have exactly the same rights as everybody else. If conversion practices are abhorrent for a gay men, abhorrent for lesbian women, and abhorrent for bisexual people, then they are abhorrent for trans people too.

4/28/2022,"A bizarre, unwholesome, sexually explicit melodrama whose depiction of rape would now be considered problematic, to say the least. Penélope Cruz is made up to look authentic and unglamorous as Italia, a vulnerable working-class woman assaulted by a prominent surgeon (played by the film’s director, Sergio Castellitto) who then conceives an obsession with her. Not a great part for Cruz, but the movie does at least approach her with something other than the traditional celebratory/lifeforce reverence. The role of the comely Greek woman Pelagia in this syrupy wartime romance is the kind of Euro love interest role that Hollywood would offer Cruz without thinking about it. Here she is torn between her hunky fisherman boyfriend, played by Christian Bale, and of course, the outrageously accented Italian officer Captain Corelli, played by Nicolas Cage, billeted on her island and twanging away at that awful mandolin of his. Cruz’s proud/passionate persona is caricatured here. Cruz had worked with director Rob Marshall on the toe-curling musical Nine, but this was something more palatable: a rare chance for her to play mainstream Hollywood comedy. She did it well, striking some meet-cute sparks with one of the biggest franchise stars of the era. Johnny Depp returned as the roguish pirate Jack Sparrow and Cruz enjoyably plays fiery pirate Angelica, an old rival or maybe old flame of Jack’s. Yet there is a disconnect: Cruz can’t help but be warm and romantic, while Depp’s Sparrow is a fastidious, oddly asexual turn. This is a 45-minute documentary directed by and starring Cruz, about the work of the Uno Entre Cien Mil foundation, a Spanish NGO that raises money to fund research projects into childhood leukemia. Cruz presents the film and interviews physicians, careworkers, parents and of course the children themselves – which she does with heartfelt sincerity and compassion. It’s interesting to see a nonfiction film that addresses Cruz’s now firmly established motherly image. The Spanish director Fernando Trueba won the best foreign language Oscar for this movie, a variation on Don Siegel’s US civil war drama The Beguiled, giving Cruz an important early role. This takes place just before the Spanish civil war: an army deserter fetches up at a villa owned by an unrepentant old anarchist who is only too happy to offer hospitality, and the fugitive finds himself highly enamoured of the owner’s daughters, especially the innocent Luz, played by Cruz. A sweet, gentle, uncomplicatedly sensual movie that established the keynote to Cruz’s own sexuality on screen. Cruz’s screen career will always be shaped by her magnificent work with the great master Pedro Almodóvar and their first joint appearance on this list is Almodóvar’s modestly intended comic romp set aboard a plane, in which his longtime leading lady contributes a high-spirited cameo at the start. She is, of all things, a baggage-handler driving one of the luggage carts across the asphalt when she is distracted by her husband, a ground-crew guy played by Antonio Banderas – which leads to a fateful revelation. It’s a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it performance and yet her appearance flavours the entire movie. Cruz co-starring with Tom Cruise should theoretically have been a conflation of pure physical gorgeousness to blow the roof off any cinema in the world. And in fact, after filming Vanilla Sky, the couple (Penélocruise? Tomcruz?) had a three-year relationship that reportedly foundered on Cruz’s inability to accept Cruise’s Scientological strictures. This was a Hollywood remake of the far superior Spanish mystery thriller Open Your Eyes (see below), in which a wealthy man gets cosmetic surgery to repair his face, which has been ruined in a car crash, and falls in love with a beautiful woman (Cruz). In this remake, Cruz reprises her role, but opposite a more self-consciously starry male lead; this arguably unbalances their relationship, and the film’s whole emotional ecosystem. It has become a cliche to compare Cruz to Sophia Loren, but it’s unavoidable in this enjoyable, silly meta-movie comedy from Trueba. Cruz is on regal form as Macarena, a gorgeous film diva from the 50s who is returning to her Spanish homeland after a triumphant Hollywood career to play Queen Isabella of Castille in a preposterous US-Spanish co-production. The production runs to farcical problems, at least partly because an anti-Franco director, serving a jail term as a political prisoner, is doing day-release manual labour on the set. The entire cast and crew become involved in a scheme for him to escape. Another short appearance from Cruz in this early movie of delicious brashness from Almodóvar, loosely adapted from the novel by Ruth Rendell. Her sensational charisma and screen presence, as a sex worker who gives birth to the movie’s hero in the opening sequence, provide the motivating power for the drama. It is also probably the case that, as the years went on, Almodóvar had to change his own style to accommodate the richness and breadth of Cruz’s performing potential – and her presence in his life is what governed his development as a film-maker. Cruz’s fiercely composed performance in this film from Isabel Coixet reclaims her character from the somewhat vapid desire-object that Philip Roth seems to have had in mind in his original novel, The Dying Animal. She plays Consuela, the literature student in a class taught by the goatish sensualist and Roth alter ego David Kepesh, played with beady-eyed concentration by Ben Kingsley. They begin an affair, and Cruz’s personal flowering is signalled by her ditching her rather lovable nerdy fringe in favour of something more glamorous. As a performer, she goes toe-to-toe with Kingsley, who might have upstaged another co-star. Here is an atypical movie from the Iranian auteur Asghar Farhadi, coolly received by some critics at the time. He gives Cruz a very strong role, in a bold and intricate mystery drama-thriller, as Laura, who comes for a family wedding to the Spanish village of her childhood with her two children, leaving her husband behind in their adopted home of Argentina. Her daughter tells Laura that she has found out there is a local man here (played by Javier Bardem) who was once in love with Laura. It is an unhealed wound of the past that is to become horribly significant when Laura’s daughter disappears. Farhadi gives Cruz something different to do – she is not the metafictional earth mother and romantic myth-icon that so many make of her, but someone more rooted in the grim and unadorned real world of secrets and shame. Here is Cruz’s movie debut – at the age of 18, she played the beautiful, young Silvia, who lives in a surreally conceived Spanish small town where the main employers are a ham production plant and an underwear factory. She has been having an affair with the spoilt young heir to the tighty-whitey empire; the man’s formidable mother tries to break them up by hiring a handsome man to seduce Silvia, and this is Raúl, a wannabe bullfighter who has recently been doing some male-lingerie modelling, and has in fact an emotional connection with Silvia’s mother. He is played by Bardem, whose appearance in Cruz’s CV here is significant given that they were to get married almost 20 years later. Like Belle Époque the same year, Jamón Jamon’s extravagant sexiness and absurdity set the keynote for Cruz’s own sensuality and desirability, which were coloured by a kind of romantic innocence and charm. Basque film-maker Julio Medem directed this brashly emotional melodrama, clearly constructed around Cruz’s established persona, and for some critics, it was too schematic. But it is such a lovely performance from her that the film deserves attention. She plays Magda, a teacher and single mum who gets breast cancer and then forms a relationship with Arturo, played by Luis Tosar, a romantic development leading to a complex emotional triangle involving Magda’s doctor. Granted, there is something contrived and even a bit preposterous about it all, but Cruz sells it with conviction; she is vivid in the way that only she can be, and the film shimmers and throbs with emotion. A flawed but very intriguing film about illusion and reality with hints of Buñuel and Franju, and growing cult status. It comes from director and co-writer Alejandro Amenábar, starring the Spanish actor Eduardo Noriega and Cruz – later remade as Vanilla Sky, with Noriego’s role going to Tom Cruise. Noriega plays César, a rich young guy who gets cosmetic surgery after being horribly disfigured in a car crash and then experiences ultra-real hallucinations indistinguishable from reality involving an affair with the fascinating young woman, Silvia (Cruz), whose dalliance with him led to the crash. In some ways, this movie was instrumental in Cruz getting cast as a heightened version of the manic pixie dream girl: the beautiful, unattainable, faintly dreamlike muse-like figure for entranced men. Cruz won her best supporting actress Oscar for this Barcelona-set film from Woody Allen – a moderate comedy from Allen’s luxury-tourist Euro period that also included his Italian romp To Rome With Love (2012), in which Cruz played a stereotypically conceived Italian call girl. This is a more interesting and engaged role for her and, whatever the film’s drawbacks, Cruz absolutely blows the rest of the cast out of the water with a showstopper of a comic performance. She plays Maria Elena, the passionate, troubled ex-wife of the moody Picasso-ish artist Juan Antonio, played by Bardem – and playing together in this movie kindled their professional friendship into love; they married two years later. Maria Elena is still a presence in Juan Antonio’s life, looming over his attempt to seduce two visiting Americans, the Vicky and Cristina of the title, played by Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson. Here is one of the amazing movie mirages or dizzyingly mesmeric meta-melodramas that come so naturally to Almodóvar. Cruz plays a stunningly charismatic movie star and producer’s mistress called Lena (inevitably, this is short for Magdalena, another hint of the sacredness wrapped in the profane that Almodóvar has ecstatically discovered in Cruz’s screen personality). There is a wonderful scene in which Lena tries on various costumes and styles, experimenting with a platinum-blonde Marilyn look. “Don’t smile!” gasps the enchanted director. “The wig is false enough!” For some, this is the high-water mark not merely of Cruz’s career but Almodóvar’s also – and it continues to have a sensational effect, irradiating its fans with bliss. Brilliant though this is, I think later Cruz/Almodóvar pictures superseded it. When a teenage boy is tragically run over and killed in the street, his mother decides to travel to Barcelona and make contact with the boy’s father: a trans sex worker who has also had a relationship with – and indeed impregnated – Sister Rosa, a young nun played by Cruz. It is an amazingly potent, complex pattern of emotional relationships and sexual identities, and although Cruz is not the star (this is Cecilia Roth), her presence is integral. Almodóvar found in Cruz that innocent and almost childlike quality that anchors the movie’s melodrama. Once again, Cruz’s presence marks the supercharged place where life and art meet in an Almodóvar film: a film about pleasure that is itself a pleasure. Antonio Banderas plays Salvador, a film director who is in the grip of midlife crisis, health worries and a career lull. A chance meeting (that key Almodóvar narrative component) unlocks something in him and he experiences ecstatic memories of his mother, wonderfully played by Cruz, a performance that fuses sensuality, motherhood and innocence – and also that certain sort of beauty that is idealised and poignantly unattainable through being in the past. Cruz and Almodóvar took it to the next level with this late-breaking masterpiece about the passionate courage of single mothers. Cruz plays Janis, a stylish photographer who gets pregnant after a brief affair; she finds herself sharing a room in the maternity unit with Ana (Milena Smit), a troubled teen who is also going it alone. Janis becomes a friend and even in some ways becomes a mum to her too. The ensuing baby-swap drama is deepened and complicated by a plot line involving Spain’s fascist past. Cruz brings to this role a maturity, passion and emotional intelligence bordering on genius. Volver is the fierce melodrama about women’s bravery that most fully unleashes Cruz’s amazing intensity, beauty and charisma. She plays Raimunda, a hardworking wife and mother (of course) whose world shatters after a terrible act of violence. The movie has something of Sirk and also Hitchcock, and there is an amazing overhead shot of Raimunda washing a bloodstained knife in the kitchen sink. The shot discloses the glistening crown of her raven hair and an enamel miniature of the crucified Christ nestling in her cleavage – an image wittily deconstructing the patriarchal world of church and state in which Raimunda finds herself, while also celebrating her unselfconscious resourcefulness and toughness. Cruz has a glorious song in this film: a lament for past lives and loves that she delivers for the crowd in a restaurant. She is one of cinema’s great heroines.",Arts/Film,Penelope Cruz’s 20 best films – ranked!,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/28/penelope-cruz-20-best-films-ranked
4/28/2022,"Hofesh Shechter’s dance always gives way to darkness at some point. You may start with a hand-scrawled sign saying “Part I, Pop”, and self-possessed performers channelling music-video vibes, looking us straight in the eye as bodies wind and pump and pop. But inevitably 10 minutes later half the dancers are flogging the other half, bodies fallen to the ground. Such is life in Shechter’s world. Alongside the darkness comes playful cynicism – including about Shechter’s own art form – anarchic energy, humour, and a whiff of the Peggy Lee line: if that’s all there is, my friends, then let’s keep dancing. All these are in the mix in Contemporary Dance 2.0, a reboot of a piece Shechter made in 2019 for Sweden’s GöteborgsOperans Danskompani, reworked for Shechter II, his own junior company of dancers aged 18-25. It’s a strong, hardworking group, pummelling the accents of the choreography for 55 minutes to Shechter’s own clubby score. Shechter’s choreography is shot through with countless references, magpied steps and fleeting images that sometime feel like subliminal advertising – did I just see what I thought I saw? He pinches from different styles, arm movements from waacking or locking, gyrating hips from Latin dance. There’s a machine gun motion, a man turned monkey. There are sudden changes of texture, from sharp bursts to serpentine bodies. But it’s still all recognisably Shechter. A pulsing current drives the movement, and its repetition and ritual become mesmeric – the dancers themselves sometimes look as if they’re in a trance state. This troupe is about half the size of that in the Swedish original, and you can imagine more bodies would increase the impact. Dancers hold up placards announcing each section with ironic detachment. Part 4, entitled “contemporary dance”, swaps electronic beats for Bach, and front-facing unison for the dancers noodling off on their own trajectories, but actually many of the steps are similar. What is Shechter saying? That all these things and more are contemporary dance? Is he mocking labels and conventions? Or just playing with how you can shape energy on stage and push it out into the room? Sometimes that last one is what matters the most.

4/28/2022,"My friend Malcolm Evans, who has died aged 61 of heart failure, was a former Fleet Street journalist who became a well-known figure in Manchester on the business startup scene, and whose expertise was sought by many aspiring entrepreneurs. He was born in Cinderford in the Forest of Dean, the younger of the two sons of a Welsh college lecturer, William Evans, and his wife, Margaret (nee White), a school secretary from Scotland. We met at the age of 16 at Morecambe grammar school, from where Malcolm went to read history at Downing College, Cambridge, graduating in 1981. He then trained as a journalist on the Lancaster Guardian and in 1984 went to be a reporter at the Keighley News in West Yorkshire, where he won the title of National Young Journalist of the Year in 1984 for a collection of his stories on local government. After some reporting shifts on the News of the World, in 1986 he got a job on the Daily Mail, where one story required him to approach the disgraced tycoon Robert Maxwell for a quote in a lift. Maxwell told him to “fuck off”, although the subsequent story said merely that he had offered “no comment”. In 1987 Malcolm became the youngest news editor on a national paper, aged 27, when he joined the newly launched News on Sunday. Unfortunately the paper folded after just seven months. Disillusioned, he then turned his back on Fleet Street. Years of hard work and struggle followed, including a spell selling air conditioning. In the late 1980s he moved to Ireland with his partner, Aoife Thornton, where they had two children, Mella and Bebhinn. Malcolm looked back on his period in Dublin with great affection, but the relationship ended and he returned to Manchester. He was involved in various business startups, including as a non-executive director of the property company Makeurmove.co.uk, as founder of Funding Enterprise, a body that carries out research on corporate finance, and as a director of 4Scaleups, a management consultancy. He developed an excellent reputation in the world of digital startups and was often sought out for his wise counsel and support. In particular he excelled at finding funding for others and helping those in need; he was also kind and generous with his time, advice and money. A big character with a wardrobe of eclectic shirts, he had a longstanding interest in gyms and bodybuilding and was a committed biker, bearing the scars of a number of road-based mishaps. He had a strong religious faith and a sure belief in the resurrection, and enjoyed high church Anglicanism. He also loved the natural world and wild swimming. In 2003 he married Susan Wildman, whom he had first met when they were in their 20s, working in local journalism. He is survived by Susan, by Mella and Bebhinn, his stepchildren, Sophie and Matt, his mother and a brother.",News/Business,Malcolm Evans obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/28/malcolm-evans-obituary
4/28/2022,"Good morning. Vladimir Putin has threatened allies of Ukraine that if any country were to intervene in the war, it would be hit with “lightning-fast” retaliation. The Russian president’s remarks to lawmakers in St Petersburg came as the UK called for Moscow to be so weakened militarily that Putin could no longer threaten European security. “If someone intends to intervene in the ongoing events from the outside, and create strategic threats for Russia that are unacceptable to us, they should know that our retaliatory strikes will be lightning-fast,” said Putin. He said Moscow had “all the tools for this”, saying he “wanted everyone to know” Russia would “use them if necessary”. The British defence secretary has said the UK supports pushing Russia completely out of Ukraine, saying Putin may order his troops to dig in and become a “cancerous growth” in the country. Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russia of “energy blackmail” against Europe after its decision to cut off gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria. Global organisations and volunteers are rushing to get emergency contraception into Ukrainian hospitals as reports of rapes continue to rise, particularly in the east. The Minneapolis police department engaged in a pattern of racial discrimination for at least a decade, a state inquiry launched after George Floyd’s murder found. After an almost two-year investigation, the report by the Minnesota department of human rights found a trend of: Stopping and arresting Black people at a higher rate. Using force more often on people of color. A culture where racist language is tolerated. The report said that the agency and the city would negotiate a court-enforceable agreement – known as a consent decree – to deal with problems it identified. Rebecca Lucero, the human rights commissioner, said the agreement would remain in force for “as long as it takes to do it right”. Who will be involved in the consent decree? It will include input from residents, officers and city staff among others. What other immediate changes did the report suggest? Stronger accountability of officers’ conduct, improving training and better communication with the public about critical incidents such as officer-involved shootings. A member of the far-right Proud Boys group has pleaded guilty to obstructing police officers during the January 6 Capitol attack. Louis Enrique Colon, from Missouri, admitted to crossing police barricades during the riot and climbing a wall. After entering the Capitol building, he used his hands and a chair to obstruct police who were trying to lower retractable doors to stop the rioters. Colon, 45, was charged in February 2021, with four others in the Kansas City Proud Boys chapter. He is the first defendant in that case to plead guilty. What sentence does he face? A statutory maximum of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. He is likely to get a reduced sentence for cooperation. It comes two weeks after a Proud Boys leader, Charles Donohoe, pleaded guilty to obstructing an official proceeding and assaulting and impeding police officers. The consulting firm McKinsey has denied illegally hiding work for the drugmaker Purdue Pharma while it advised the Food and Drug Administration. A report found consultants worked with the pharmaceutical company, which kickstarted the opioid epidemic, while simultaneously advising the FDA on drug safety. McKinsey’s global managing partner said the firm was protecting client confidentiality and denied a conflict of interest, saying it was not advising on regulation. New York’s highest court has ruled against the state’s new congressional district maps, which were broadly viewed as pro-Democrat. The party had hoped redrawing New York district boundaries would lessen expected losses in redistricted Republican-voting states. A pile of about 150 skulls found by Mexican police near the Guatemalan border are from sacrificial victims killed between AD900 and 1200, a decade-long analysis has determined. Police in 2012 thought they were looking at a crime scene. Global measles cases have soared by nearly 80% this year amid disruption caused by the pandemic, the UN has said. Covid-19 has disrupted vaccination drives for other diseases around the world. More than 17,300 measles cases were reported in January and February, compared with about 9,600 during the same period last year. Just a few years ago, it seemed to some that the US was consistently marching towards greater legislative rights and societal inclusion for LGBTQ+ people, from marriage equality in 2015 to the 2020 supreme court ruling that the 1964 Civil Rights Act protected gay, lesbian and transgender workers. Fast forward to the present day and LGBTQ+ Americans are once again under attack, with a slew of anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and legislation. Peter-Astrid Kane charts how this happened. Destruction of pristine rainforests continued at a “relentless” pace in 2021, with 11.1m hectares (27.4m acres) of tree cover lost in the tropics last year, including 3.75m hectares of primary forest that is key to reducing global heating and biodiversity loss. The figures have triggered concerns governments will not meet a Cop26 agreement to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. No, really – KFC has designed a handbag for the British market, retailing at £198 ($248) and shaped to be carry one of its Twister Wraps.
