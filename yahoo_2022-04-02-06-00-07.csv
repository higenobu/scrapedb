4/2/2022,"Herschel Walker, the former star running back who is now former President Trump’s pick for Senate in Georgia, repeatedly lied about his academic background, a CNN report found. Walker in December admitted that he did not graduate from the University of Georgia after the Atlanta-Journal Constitution reported that he claimed to have done so on his website. It turns out, however, that this wasn’t the only time Walker had lied about graduating. CNN found that he also made the claim during during a 2017 motivational speech, and during an interview on Sirius XM radio the same year. He alleged that he not only graduated, but graduated in the top one percent of the class.

CNN cites stories from the time in which Walker said he maintained a B average at the school, and that he told the Chicago Tribune a few years later that he had a 3.0 GPA before his grades fell off. CNN says Walker’s campaign did not offer any proof of his claim that he graduated in the top one percent of his class. Walker’s website also at one point boasted that he graduated valedictorian of his high school. He made the same claim in his 2008 book Breaking Free: My Life with Dissociative Identity Disorder. “If I’m proud of anything I did in my high school career, it’s what I did in the classroom that I reflect on and relish the most,” he wrote. “I did more than just shed the ‘stupid’ label placed on me as a result of my speech impediment. I shed it, erased it, and rewrote it with the titles: Beta Club president and class valedictorian.” Walker’s website no longer says he was valedictorian, only noting that he graduated at the “top of his class.” If there’s any proof out there that Walker was, in fact, class valedictorian, it’s apparently hard to find. His campaign sought to minimize this. “There is not a single voter in Georgia who believes that whether Herschel graduated at the ‘top of his class’ or as Valedictorian 40 years ago has any bearing on his ability to be a great United States Senator,” Mallory Blount, Walker’s communications director, told CNN. Walker would run against Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock should he win the GOP primary. Some Republicans, however, say his “baggage is too heavy,” and are trying to ensure his doesn’t win the nomination. Walker has been accused of domestic abuse, with his ex-wife claiming he once held a gun to her head and told her he was going to “blow [her] fucking brains out.” Walker spoke at Trump’s rally in Georgia last week. “I’m sick and tired of them wanting to teach CTR in schools,” he said at the event, referring to critical race theory. A few weeks earlier, Walker said he didn’t understand how humans could have evolved from apes while speaking at a church outside of Atlanta. “At one time science said, man came from apes. Did it not?” he wondered. “If that is true, why are there still apes?

4/2/2022,"The Ghislaine Maxwell juror who failed to disclose that he was a victim of sexual abuse, putting Maxwell's sex trafficking conviction in jeopardy, has made a ""bombshell revelation"" in a soon-to-be aired TV interview, according to the British socialite's lawyer. GHISLAINE MAXWELL: JUROR CALLS FALSE ANSWER ON QUESTIONNAIRE ‘BIGGEST MISTAKE’ Attorney Bobbi Sternheim notified U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan of the development in a letter Friday and asked her to hold off on ruling on Maxwell's request for a new trial until the Paramount Plus series, titled ""Ghislaine – Partner in Crime,"" broadcasts. ""The trailer announces a ‘bombshell revelation’ from Juror 50 in his ‘only in-depth interview,’"" the letter states of the juror, also known by his first and middle name, Scotty David. ""We have learned that Paramount is holding off airing the series pending the Court's ruling."" The documentary was initially scheduled to air March 29, Sternheim wrote. In a letter opposing the stay, prosecutor Maureen Comey called it ""pure speculation that an unreleased interview with Juror 50 could potentially contain information relevant to the defendant's motion."" Scotty David's defense lawyer Todd Spodek told Fox News Digital that his client taped the interview Jan. 4 – long before he was hauled into court over the blunder. Scotty David was grilled during a hearing March 8 over his false answer on the prescreening juror questionnaire. PRINCE ANDREW REACHES SETTLEMENT WITH SEXUAL ABUSE ACCUSER VIRGINIA GIUFFRE He was directly asked whether he had been a victim of sexual abuse, and he checked a box indicating ""no."" He testified that he had ""skimmed way too fast"" and called the lapse ""one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made in my life."" The false answer only came to light after Maxwell was convicted in December of sex trafficking and other charges for recruiting young women to be sexually abused by late financier Jeffrey Epstein, who committed suicide in jail in 2019. After the guilty verdict, Scotty David told reporters in interviews that he had swayed some jurors who were on the fence by sharing his own experience with sexual abuse during deliberations, prompting the defense to demand that the court toss the verdict. ""Juror 50 does not consider himself a victim,"" Spodek told Fox News Digital. ""His position then, and now, is that this is nothing more than an inadvertent, honest mistake.""",U.S./Fox News,Ghislaine Maxwell juror makes 'bombshell revelation' in new interview: lawyers,https://news.yahoo.com/ghislaine-maxwell-juror-makes-apos-180048242.html
