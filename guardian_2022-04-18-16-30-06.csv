4/18/2022,"In the summer of 2020, Liverpool were big favourites to sign Timo Werner from RB Leipzig before the move fell through when Jürgen Klopp could not assure his fellow German of regular first-team football. Liverpool fans have spent the last couple of seasons relieved that the striker chose Chelsea instead, his numbers way down on what they were in the Bundesliga. Werner remains a maddening but intriguing presence. Watch the denouement of the FA Cup semi-final. In the final 10 minutes, he overruns the ball to ruin a fast break, has the energy to get back and halt a Palace counterattack, is named man of the match, flashes a cross into the box with no Chelsea shirt in sight, drives into the area again to put the ball on a plate for Romelu Lukaku, who hits a post, and rounds it all off by ballooning a dreadful shot into Row Z. There is Werner’s Chelsea career in microcosm. Wild, erratic and inconsistent and yet he’s capable of being the biggest threat to Klopp and Liverpool in next month’s FA Cup final. David Tindall Match report: Chelsea 2-0 Crystal Palace Liverpool’s previous great era of the 1970s and 1980s owed its longevity to a careful evolution of the squad. One or two players at a time would be quietly added to augment and eventually supplant those in the first XI. Decades on, and with top-level football a squad rather than team game, Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool is doing much the same, with recent additions making big contributions to the club’s push for multiple trophies. Ibrahima Konaté’s header for Liverpool’s first was the latest showing of his power in the air while Luis Díaz’s energy and devilment caused Manchester City huge problems as Liverpool compiled the 3-0 first-half lead that eventually took them through to the final. Diogo Jota, last season’s addition, has already proved indispensable in the forward line. Though Manchester City have the greater financial muscle, Liverpool are keeping pace via careful recruitment of players finding it easier to adapt than Jack Grealish so far has. John Brewin Match report: Manchester City 2-3 Liverpool Anti-Glazer protests, a two-goal lead lost before Cristiano Ronaldo’s third sealed another late win, and next up Liverpool at Anfield: these are difficult days at Manchester United. Ralf Rangnick was supremely critical of how his team defend: not physical enough, in essence. Of Tuesday’s opponents, the German was glowing. “They are extremely good. It’s no coincidence that they’re as good as they are. Jürgen has built that team over the last six and a half years. Six or seven of those players used to be my/our players, we signed them for our clubs when nobody knew them.” As Schalke and RB Leipzig manager, and director of football of the latter club as well as RB Salzburg, Naby Keïta, Takumi Minamino, Ibrahima Konaté, Joël Matip and Sadio Mané have all been under Rangnick’s tutelage. United, though, are a universe away from their great rivals. Jamie Jackson Match report: Manchester United 3-2 Norwich For the second time this season, Leandro Trossard scored a 90th-minute winner in London. And, for the second time in a week, the Belgian scored a goal that did damage to a north London club’s hopes of making next season’s Champions League. Trossard’s goal at Tottenham was not dissimilar to his late winner at Brentford in September, cutting in from the left and giving the opposition goalkeeper no chance with a driving right-foot finish. With the same foot he had smashed in the opener at Arsenal the previous week. Brighton struggle to score goals, Trossard’s winner at Spurs only their fourth in nine Premier League matches, but given the chance he can be a neat, cool finisher. Brighton’s winner might have come late but was fully deserved. Trossard heavily contributed to aggressive pressing that squeezed down supply lines as Yves Bissouma dominated Tottenham’s midfield trio. John Brewin Match report: Tottenham 0-1 Brighton Mikel Arteta has acknowledged there will be psychological ramifications if Arsenal miss out on qualifying for the Champions League for a sixth successive season. After a third straight defeat arguably the biggest challenge before they visit Chelsea on Wednesday will be the mental strain. At 30, the former Southampton defender Cédric Soares was Arsenal’s oldest player in a starting XI with an average age of 23.5 at St Mary’s – Granit Xhaka was the only other starter over the age of 24 – and Arteta recognises this is new territory for most, emphasising that his squad need “all the support in the world” if they are to secure a top-four place. “They are 19, 20 and 21 years old, most of them,” Arteta said. “We are in the same position where we were with one less game. We have to liven them up. And the task is big. But the opportunity [is] as well. It’s so precious.” Ben Fisher Match report: Southampton 1-0 Arsenal Maxwel Cornet was a constant, much-needed threat at West Ham. His corner led to Burnley’s goal, and his clever diagonal run fashioned a second-half chance Jay Rodriguez ought to have done better with. On the stroke of half-time, Cornet won a penalty; a sublime touch to control Josh Brownhill’s pass and brought down after a jink past Lukasz Fabianski. Taking responsibility for the spot-kick, Cornet’s approach had the fluidity of ice – his chance to double the lead went low and well wide. Seven days previously, his glaring miss cost his side an equaliser at Norwich. Harsh to say four points dropped? Probably. But seasons are made on such fine margins. Sam Dalling Match report: West Ham 1-1 Burnley Even if his manager has seen him play better than in Brentford’s third successive victory, which took them to 11th, there is no doubting the difference Christian Eriksen has made. The Denmark midfielder’s assist for Pontus Jansson’s late winner against Watford was the second he has provided since joining on a short-term deal until the end of the season, with a goal against Chelsea in the 4-1 win at Stamford Bridge sandwiched in-between. But while Tottenham supporters will be wary of Eriksen’s threat when Antonio Conte’s side travel to west London on Saturday, Frank insisted that the 30-year-old still has room for improvement. “To be fair, I don’t think he was that good today,” said Frank. “A solid game, but [there’s] more to come from him.” Ed Aarons Match report: Watford 1-2 Brentford For a manager who had just lost to a rather harsh 95th-minute goal, Leicester’s Brendan Rodgers proved refreshingly magnanimous. “I’m so happy for the supporters here,” said Rodgers, displaying a characteristic touch of class as he praised Eddie Howe’s impact on Tyneside. “It’s one of the grounds and cities I’ve always enjoyed coming to. Newcastle’s one of the most iconic clubs in British football; it’s a special place.” On a day when Leicester, with Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall outstanding, dominated possession, it took two goals and a special performance, from an extra-special player to secure the three points that all but banished Newcastle’s relegation fears. Howe bought extremely well in January but the £33m spent on his marquee signing, the Brazil playmaker Bruno Guimarães from Lyon, looks an excellent investment in a pretty much complete midfielder who has already established himself as a cult hero. Louise Taylor Match report: Newcastle 2-1 Leicester Liverpool know all about a goalkeeper messing up in a huge match so may have felt some karmic payback after Zack Steffen’s spectacular Wembley bungle. Just a week on from Ederson’s heart-stopping clearance from across his goalline at the Etihad, perhaps it was unfortunate timing that Steffen had been given such a recent reminder that keeping cool and playing out from the back is a non-negotiable modus operandi for a Manchester City goalkeeper. Ederson avoided the calamity but Steffen was punished. Should the American have been playing in the first place? Yes, he’s appeared in previous rounds but away ties at Swindon and Southampton along with Fulham at home aren’t exactly in the same category as a Wembley semi against Liverpool. Jürgen Klopp went with reserve goalkeeper Caoimhín Kelleher in the Carabao Cup final but there was one crucial difference: the Irish stopper had a first-choice defence in front of him. Steffen did not. There are times to give the No 2 a go but this wasn’t one of them. David Tindall Guardiola defends Steffen after mistake costs his side Sitting 13th in the Premier League seems a default position for Crystal Palace and yet they are a far more exciting Premier League presence than the one programmed to avoid relegation by Roy Hodgson. But a key figure of the Patrick Vieira revolution was taken away in the FA Cup semi-final on Sunday with Conor Gallagher ineligible to appear against his parent club after Chelsea refused him permission to play. The Gallagher issue was always going to rear its head should Palace lose and the fact that Chelsea’s opener was scored by another former Palace loanee, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, only rubbed salt into the wounds. Gallagher’s goals garner attention but it’s his energy and closing down that Palace missed most. Would the moves that led to Loftus-Cheek and Mason Mount’s second-half goals have been stopped at source with Gallagher on the pitch? The big clubs have enough advantages; the parent club rule does not need to be one of them.

4/18/2022,"‘I’ve very much enjoyed turning 60,” says Kate Mosse, tipping several sachets of sugar into a cup of takeaway coffee. It’s 9am, and the bestselling novelist and founder of the Women’s prize for fiction has travelled up to London from her home on the Sussex coast to sit in on a rehearsal of her first full-length play, staged at Chichester Festival theatre. Across the table from her, in an unglamorous basement room that smells faintly of mildew, is the director who is helping her to transform one of her novels into a piece of theatre. And not just any piece, but a large-cast gothic revenge drama, with many mildewed basements of its own, which will open the spring season of a venue that Mosse has loved since she was a child. A debut play, written and directed by women, launching a season on the main stage of a major regional producing house is “as rare as crows’ teeth”, they laugh. “No pressure, then, no pressure at all!” The novel in question is The Taxidermist’s Daughter, which is set around Mosse’s home near Chichester in the unusually stormy year of 1912. Sea water surges through the marshes and carrion birds gather ominously above the local church as long-submerged evils bubble to the surface, confronting the eponymous heroine Connie Gifford with memories she lost years earlier in a mysterious childhood accident. Mosse wrote the novel at a time when the task of caring for her elderly parents meant she could no longer spend long stretches of each year in the French city of Carcassonne, which – she says – gave her the freedom to become a writer, and was the inspiration for her Burning Chambers series of historical novels. It took her back to the marshes where she used to play with her two sisters, and into local news archives, where she found reports of the havoc wreaked by the wettest year on record. “The Titanic had just sunk, but nobody was talking about that,” she says. “All the reports were of people who had drowned because they slipped in the dark on the way to the village to buy something.” The novel was published in 2014, when unusually wet weather didn’t seem as sinister as it does today, but it evokes a world that – like our own – is on the brink of seismic change that will only be comprehensible in retrospect. It’s all boiled down to the story of two women’s fight to redress wrongs they have suffered at the hands of powerful and secretive men. “At the core of it,” says director Róisín McBrinn, “is a young woman who has been separated from the justice that she deserves – which, unfortunately, is still a very common theme. And a woman who is believed less than the men around her, were she to have had the opportunity even to be heard. Which, again, is a very modern theme: women searching for their place, women defending their space, issues of class. It’s all very much alive. And the kind of cohesive power of a community to suppress secrets, unfortunately, is not something that’s gone away. All of those themes are highly contemporary, but also completely coherent to the period.” The story of the transformation of The Taxidermist’s Daughter from page to stage speaks of a place that has in some ways remained proudly parochial. Locals refer to Chichester as “Chi” (pronounced “chai”, as in tea). Mosse and her writer husband, Greg, met as pupils at “Chi High”, then separated into girls’ and boys’ schools, and have spent the last quarter-century as part of a three-generation household in a sprawling Edwardian house that had done its own community service, as a hostel for soldiers, then nurses, and then an an old people’s home. Mosse’s parents were among the local “angels” who pledged £100 each to make Chichester Festival theatre happen in the early 1960s. So when a new artistic director – Daniel Evans – arrived six years ago, with a mission that included getting the local community more involved, nothing was more natural than to invite him over for supper. “We were chatting away when he suddenly put his hand in his bag, slapped The Taxidermist’s Daughter on the table and said, ‘I want you to do this for me,’” says Mosse, who was so busy with her other lives – as a novelist, carer, and literary activist – that it took several years to get back to him. Once she’d agreed, Evans approached McBrinn, a Dubliner with whom he’d worked at his previous theatre in Sheffield, who was now running Clean Break, a theatre company for women with lived experience of the criminal justice system. “It was like Blind Date,” says Mosse. “Yes,” McBrinn fires back. “​​We did pre-marriage counselling, which was successful, and a chemistry test – which is essential, because if you can’t find a flow, a sense that you can collaborate, then personally I’m not interested.” Mosse felt she had the most to lose. “I was like, I really love her – what if she only gives me a four and we never meet again? Because doing a new play is a huge thing for any director, and I’m quite an odd first playwright, even given that I’ve done some other stuff before. It’s not like I’m a 25-year-old who needs to be mentored.” It took some help from Mosse’s actor son, Felix, to excavate the play from the novel. “As a novelist, I’m used to being responsible for the whole world. He would often say, ‘The actor will play that, Mum.’ On the stage, you have flesh and blood, so don’t tell the actor how to act.” The big structural decision was to turn the story from a gothic mystery – which only unravels towards the end, as Connie’s memories return – to a revenge drama involving, from the outset, a second woman, Cassie, who is a shadow presence for most of the novel. This decision meant stripping out a lot of the novelistic detail, such as the gory processes of Victorian taxidermy. “It’s the same story, but I realised it is a revenge play in the end, so it needed to be short and sharp, and packing a big punch.” says Mosse. “Why is Hamlet, which is a revenge play, so long? It’s because he’s not the right avenger. He can’t do it. If he could, we’d be out of the theatre in 45 minutes. That would be the end of it.” For all the forfeit of novelistic detail, Mosse has caught the theatre bug. She has just delivered a book celebrating the role of women in history – due for publication in October – but her next project will be an original play. “My 50s were a decade of loss and caring, when I lost both of my parents,” she says. “I feel more hungry for new experiences now than I did 10 years ago. I think it’s very easy, particularly as a woman, to not be prepared to fail, but women have to be ambitious. You know that famous Beckett quote: ‘Fail again. Fail better’? There’s a bit – ‘No matter’ – that often gets left out, because it’s not quite as snappy. But actually, ‘No matter’ is the point.” The Taxidermist’s Daughter is at Chichester Festival theatre, until 30 April.",Arts/Stage,"‘Don’t tell actors how to act, Mum!’: Kate Mosse on how her debut play was a family affair",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/18/actors-mum-kate-mosse-debut-play-taxidermists-daughter
4/18/2022,"In March 1976, when doing the rounds of the Barvikha sanatorium outside Moscow, a doctor found the once-celebrated architect Boris Iofan unconscious in his armchair. He was holding a drawing of a statue, Worker and Kolkhoz Woman by Vera Mukhina, that had surmounted Iofan’s most famous built work, the Soviet pavilion at the 1937 Paris World’s Fair. He had been working up proposals, obsessively perhaps, for a less ignominious setting than the one where this sculpture had ended up, on an undersized plinth in a Moscow exhibition ground. It was amazing that Iofan was still (just) alive. Born to a Jewish family in Odesa in 1891, he lived through pogroms, revolutions, world wars and times of famine. As the architect of Stalin’s most prominent projects, he spent years close to the murderous and capricious dictator. Those around him – patrons, friends, colleagues, associates, fellow members of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee – were murdered in large numbers, sometimes after torture. Iofan not only survived, but also created some of the most memorable designs of 20th-century architecture. He is an ideal subject for Deyan Sudjic, whose earlier book The Edifice Complex explored his interest in the interaction of architecture and power. Iofan has long fascinated Sudjic, who now tells his story – and the boggling horrors and absurdities that surrounded him – in a way that is accessible, informative and observant. He has an eye for telling details, such as the luxury finishes on facilities built for the Soviet elite, and for striking characters. There is Iofan’s snakish rival Karo Alabyan. There is the clownishly ideological architect Hannes Meyer, who continued to praise the Soviet system even after it had killed the mother of his son, and sent the boy to a prison camp. At the centre of the book is the saga of the Palace of the Soviets, a skyscraper surmounted by a gigantic statue of Lenin, an intended celebration of the Bolshevik revolution that fused the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty, and would have been larger than both. The project announced and defined Stalin’s preferred architectural style – monumental, classical, sometimes with Slavic aspects. It eventually foundered after the outbreak of war, when its insane requirements for steel and labour proved unsustainable. Something that did get built was the pavilion in Paris, another building that acted as a plinth for a large sculpture, the one that preoccupied Iofan at the end of his life, of a young man and a young woman raising a hammer and sickle to the sky. The pavilion stood on one side of a wide avenue oriented towards the Eiffel Tower, directly opposite Albert Speer’s pavilion for Nazi Germany. The confrontation dramatised a clash of two totalitarian ideologies, but also their kinship, as there were similarities in Iofan’s and Speer’s stripped-down classical styles. Many of those who worked with Iofan on the Paris pavilion would be killed by the time he built another one in New York, two years later, but he somehow stayed alive and working, despite a provocative liking for smart suits and ownership of a Buick convertible car. He eventually fell from favour from the late 40s on, in part as a result of Stalin’s antisemitic campaigns against “cosmopolitanism”: he would continue to work into the 60s, but on less glamorous projects than before. He died a few days after that doctor found him in his chair. His legacy would include substantial buildings, such as one of Moscow’s metro stations, a prominent apartment building called the House on the Embankment, and the sanatorium where he ended his life. But his greatest impact was through images: the drawings of the unbuilt palace and photographs of the short-lived Paris pavilion. His influence is clear in the seven Moscow skyscrapers – stacked-up, fantastical, Russianised versions of Manhattan towers – that other architects designed for Stalin after the war. Iofan remains somewhat inscrutable in all this, the means of his survival a mystery. Those who knew him described him as charming, gentle and “able to compromise in personal relationships”, or, less favourably, as “sly”. But he was also “unyielding” when it came to artistic matters. Like many architects, it seems, his work was everything to him, and he would go to great lengths to realise his vision. You could say he was a stooge, an accomplice of great crimes, a propagandist, albeit one with considerable talent and flair. You might, more charitably, say he was struggling to survive in almost impossible circumstances. Sudjic chooses not to condemn him, but lays out the facts of his life as best can be done. The result is a vivid account of a demented world. Stalin’s Architect by Deyan Sudjic is published by Thames & Hudson (£30).

4/18/2022,"Jamie Acton could not have been clearer. “You’re probably abnormal in the rugby league world if you haven’t taken drugs at some point, whether that is socially or performance‑enhancing,” the former Leigh forward said this year when he revealed he had taken drugs throughout his career. Rugby league is certainly not immune to drugs; to suggest otherwise would be irresponsible. But Acton’s claim that a player was “abnormal” if they had not been involved with drugs raised the question of just how much the game had overlooked the issue. Does rugby league have a deeper‑rooted problem with drugs than the sport always believed? “I do not recognise those comments from Jamie,” the Rugby Football League’s chief regulatory officer, Karen Moorhouse, says. “We’ve spoke with current and former players who also say they didn’t identify with them, but it does highlight the work we are trying to do to make sure we keep the sport clean and to keep the achievements of players as honest as possible. Those claims haven’t led to a flood of other admissions.” Rugby league was the third-most tested sport in the UK last year by UK Anti-Doping, with more than 600 tests on players carried out. Six players across the professional and amateur game are serving Ukad-enforced bans for drugs, including Acton, who became the first player to be banned for a historical offence after he admitted his previous substance abuse in January. In rugby union that number is 18, while in football there are only three. That would imply that the two rugby codes have a bigger issue than other sports. “I’m absolutely sure there is the odd person risking their career and doing it because they feel a lack of confidence or they’re not where they want to be physically,” the former England international Kevin Brown says. “But as far as it being widespread, having played in Super League for so long, I’d say that’s not true. We get tested so much, you’d have to spend so much on drugs that escape the system. I’ve played at a lot of clubs. I’ve not seen it. I would have heard a lot more about it.” Brown is not the only former player to share that opinion. Garreth Carvell is the head of the Rugby League Players Association but he also played in Super League throughout his career and represented Great Britain too. “That accusation [from Acton] puts players like myself under the spotlight, because they’re saying things like ‘everybody was doing it’,” he says. “I was tested rigorously. I never tested positive. It was a shot out of the blue to suggest it was widespread and I’m not sure that’s the truth.” However, despite the belief that performance-enhancing drug abuse is minimal, there is an issue which is impossible to ignore. In recent years several players have tested positive for recreational drugs such as cocaine, including international players such as Rangi Chase and Zak Hardaker. Club owners are privately aware that social drugs are a growing problem, and the RFL has ramped up its educational policies on the matter. “Social drugs are absolutely a live issue, but we have a policy which starts from encouraging anyone who has an issue with recreational drugs to approach us and it will be treated as a welfare issue rather than disciplinary,” Moorhouse says. “We believe we have the tools in our armoury to tackle it.” One current international player, who did not wish to be named, underlined the severity of the problem: “I don’t see much in the way of performance-enhancing drugs but things like cocaine … there are a lot of players who are in and around that on weekends with their mates and I can appreciate it’s easy to get dragged into.” Carvell says: “I think I could take a guess at maybe three players throughout my career who took performance-enhancing drugs, and that’s a guess. “On the social drugs side it’s different, but I think it’s a societal issue that has creeped into the game. The lads live a normal social life despite their status and that sort of thing blends into the game a lot easier because of the lives the players have.” While policies and routine testing can minimise performance-enhancing drug abuse, societal issues will be much more difficult to counter in a sport where players are frequently exposed to scenarios that include recreational drugs. “There’s help there in place, but the most important thing is reminding these guys of the consequences,” Carvell says. “Maybe we, as a union, need to do more on that.”",Sport/Sport,‘There’s help in place’: does rugby league have a drugs problem? | Aaron Bower,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/18/theres-help-in-place-does-rugby-league-have-a-drugs-problem
4/18/2022,"Rob Key is someone I have known for a very, very, long time. He’s been involved in cricket through his career; as a player, as a captain, and then with Sky, where he has become a prominent voice, somewhat surprisingly. I say surprisingly because they tend to hire former England captains for their main punditry and analysis roles, so Rob was a little bit of an outlier in that sense. But he has grown into the role very well and often comes up with thought-provoking conversations. Rob is a likable guy. His experience with Sky means he understands the media landscape and the news agenda, which is really important. However, I must say I’m surprised he has been named as managing director of England men’s cricket. It is very helpful to have colleagues with powerful voices in the media who can throw your name around, though clearly he does have some credentials. My own view is we are at a watershed moment in English cricket. The vacuum at the top of the game is extraordinary. I can’t think of any point in my lifetime where there has been such a lack of direction or leadership. And given where we are, are we really going to look around the room full of ex-cricketers, and say: “Why don’t you have a go?” It makes me feel uncertain about the future of English cricket. Managing director is such a prestigious role – a hugely influential one – and cricket needs someone with the right type of qualifications and experiences. John Neal, the England and Wales Cricket Board’s head of coach development, has always been very vocal on the benefits of crossing over from different sports and what a fresh pair of eyes could bring. I would question whether the ECB cast the net wide enough at such a pivotal moment for the men’s Test team, especially in the light of Joe Root’s resignation. Candidates have to have some experience of the role. It is all very well to have some interesting ideas, but you need to be able to back them up with evidence and work with people at all levels, from the ECB board to the county chairmen to the coaches and right through the structures and pathways in a systematic and methodical way. There has always been an element of jobs for the boys in cricket and society – you only have to look at the government to see that – but I do think we should have been looking outside the box; people like Rob Andrew at Sussex, or Clive Woodward, and from within cricket Mo Bobat, who has been carrying out the MD duties, and Paul Farbrace, or Vikram Solanki, who has a law degree and moved from Surrey to be a director of cricket in the Indian Premier League. Normally Andrew Strauss isn’t afraid to make strong decisions and he searched far and wide to bring in Trevor Bayliss. I was reading about Root and conjecture over who will take over as Test captain. It was said Alastair Cook had done very little captaincy with Essex before he took over the England job and that was similar with Joe, so captaincy experience would be ideal in the next candidate. Surely the same applies to the MD role, especially as we currently have no head coach or captain. The MD needs to be someone who walks into a room and makes people sit up and take notice. Root’s captaincy divided people into two camps. You can look at his record and say he led England the most times, with 27 wins, for five years and say he’s done very well. When I was involved in the England camp, I witnessed at first-hand his work ethic as a batsman and he was a great role model for the team, much like Graham Gooch was for me. I remember being in a meeting of ECB coaches once and there was a comment made that all the best players have something slightly unbalanced about their personality and their drive and hunger for success. Andy Flower turned round and said: “Well, what about Joe Root?” And that’s true, he’s so unusual to be so well balanced. Joe could mix with every group in the dressing room: the young players, the senior players; he could have dinner with Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid or with Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler. He is such a likable, popular guy with a great sense of humour. And that is an amazing attribute to have as a captain. Those with a glass half-empty would say that perhaps his captaincy was a little behind the game, a bit reactive, that there were situations where he didn’t take the game by the scruff of the neck. In terms of strategy, he could take things quite literally. England went through a period of being gung-ho and then, when Chris Silverwood came in, this switched to batting long and trying to make 500 in the first innings. But it is hard to be so prescriptive with different pitches and bowlers. At times it felt he was searching for an identity. We’re very harsh with our captains though – all Test captains make mistakes. Lots of the best ones have some very, very good bowlers on their teams. I think Joe can hold his head up high, he gave it absolutely everything. His attributes outweighed the things he didn’t have and he conducted himself brilliantly during a difficult last 12 months, under intense fire when results went against him. Sometimes you don’t realise what you’ve got until you lose it.",Sport/Sport,Rob Key’s appointment represents a gamble for rudderless England | Mark Ramprakash,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/18/rob-key-appointment-england-cricket-ecb-managing-director
4/18/2022,"In recent years it’s become fashionable for sport documentaries to include a self-referential element in which the protagonist reviews footage of their own triumphs and disasters. The facial reactions in these segments often say more than hours of talking head analysis ever could: the vision of Michael Jordan, tablet in lap, choking up with laughter as Gary Payton’s account of the 1996 NBA finals series is played back to him remains the defining image of 2020’s The Last Dance. For Shark, premiering in the US on Tuesday night, directors Jason Hehir (who also directed The Last Dance) and Thomas Odelfelt replace the tablet with a laptop kept open on a small side table next to the seated Greg Norman. The Australian has never rewatched the infamous final round of the 1996 Masters, in which he relinquished a six-shot lead to surrender the green jacket to arch-rival Nick Faldo: “There’s no need to,” he says curtly in the opening minutes of Shark. And when the footage of that fabled choke – still the biggest final-day lead ever blown in a PGA tour tournament – starts rolling on the laptop, you soon begin to understand why. The pain of every slice, hook, undercooked putt and moment of self-doubt is still very much with him, 25 years later. We see him three-putting the green on the 11th hole; we see him coming up short with his approach shot on the 12th, finding the water, and ending with a double bogey; we re-watch Norman’s anguished collapse to the ground after a chip for eagle on the 15th kisses the lip of the hole then just rolls wide. And then we see Norman, watching on in silence, shifting his weight in the chair, eyes glassy, swallowing his sighs. “Would my life be different today if I had a green jacket?” Norman asks rhetorically after the final-round playback concludes. “No. It would be beautiful to have in my trophy case, but it would not have changed one bit of my life.” It’s the least convincing line in the whole film. Norman’s final-day collapse at Augusta may now be the stuff of sporting legend, but what’s arguably less well remembered is the rich history of final-round failure that preceded the drama of 1996. Norman burst onto the PGA tour in the early 1980s, signaling his talent with a fourth-place finish at the 1981 Masters, his first spin around Augusta’s saintly turf. Norman’s Scandinavian mop, flashy pants, upright stance, easy swing, and commitment to attack made him instantly recognizable on the course. His blunt Australianness (“The Shark” was a nickname that stuck early, paying homage to a childhood spent growing up in the savage waters of far north Queensland) made him highly marketable off it, attracting the jealousy of less charismatic golfers at a time when big money was starting to roll into the sport for the first time and the commercial thirst for personality players was at a premium. Norman wanted to get a “complete hold” over the sport “on the golf course and off the golf course,” Faldo says. By 1986, his objective was almost complete. Golf watchers had begun to think of the Australian as the natural heir to the greats of the previous generation, Jack Nicklaus in particular – and possibly even as the player who could ascend golf’s Everest and win all four majors in a single year. Norman led all four majors in 1986 after three rounds; in all but one, the British Open, he collapsed on the final day and finished runner-up. That year established his reputation as a 54-hole maestro who couldn’t get it done in the final 18, and the following year cemented it: in a playoff for the 1987 Masters, Larry Mize sank an improbable chip from the rough to leave Norman with a 45-foot putt to keep the contest alive. It drifted wide. “I went home and cried on the beach,” Norman says now. “All these questions go through your head for months and months. Maybe I should have put it in the middle of the green and had a 20-footer instead of a 45-footer, maybe I got ahead of myself thinking that it was an impossible chip [for Mize]. Those things have haunted me for a long time.” A narrative has emerged that Norman was “snakebit,” fated by a uniquely malevolent fortune to lose in big tournaments to a sequence of improbable shots. In addition to the Mize chip, there was Bob Tway’s bunker shot at the 1986 PGA Championship, Robert Gomez’s fairway shot on the final hole at the 1990 Nestle Invitational at Bay Hill, and another bunker shot – this time from David Frost – on the final hole at the 1990 Zurich Classic in New Orleans. What Shark does well is put these miracle shots in context, showing the three Norman bogeys on the back nine that preceded the Mize chip, the 40 back nine he shot to set Tway up for triumph in 1986, and so on. Norman spent much of his playing days endorsing the fable of the snakebite: “I’m kind of like a fatalist, I believe that things happen for a reason,” he told former Australian prime minister Bob Hawke in a 1993 TV interview. Today he appears more sanguine: “You control your own destiny, you do your own thing,” he reflects in Shark. “You cannot control what other people do. You cannot influence what other people do. The only influence you can exert is what you do, yourself, in your shoes, with your golf clubs, with your score.” And yet, this hour in Norman’s presence never quite dispels the sense that he still feels, at some level, that the golfing gods chose him for a special category of misery. The pleasure of a documentary like Shark is not only in reliving, alongside Norman, the agony of all these collapses. He’s also eloquent on the high points, the moments during those charging final rounds when everything clicked. An example: when he reeled off four consecutive back-nine birdies on the final day at the 1986 Masters to recover from a disastrous start and pull within spitting distance of Nicklaus. “You’ve just got this freedom of mind, you’re happy and you just want to go,” Norman says. “You trust yourself, your swing is free, your mind is free, you see these shots, you execute them. You could even hit a leaf off the end of a tree if you wanted to.” Norman lost to Nicklaus, 15 years his senior, on the final hole that day. But the bond between the two golfers – avatars of two adjoining generations – emerges as particularly influential in Shark. At Turnberry in 1986, Nicklaus offered Norman a “critical” piece of final-day advice that helped the Australian overcome the nerves accumulated through two successive big-tournament collapses and clinch his first major (“Greg, just think about grip pressure tomorrow. Just think about your grip pressure.”). And he was there again to counsel Norman through a slump in the early 1990s, advising him to practice and play with “purpose”: “If you’re going to the driving range, are you just going there to hit balls and feel sorry for yourself? Or do you have a purpose?” Norman flew to Canada the next week and broke a 27-month PGA tour drought by winning the Canadian Open. “He was like my father, my brother, my mentor,” Norman says. Faldo – the more conservative, less charismatic rival who ended his career with six majors to Norman’s two – also looms large throughout Shark, though the real contrast that emerges is not between the players past but the two men as they appear today: Faldo has softened into a jolly middle age, while Norman remains as whip-fit as during his playing days. He has plenty to be thankful for: his post-playing career, taking in everything from golf course development to winemaking and the recent effort to launch a much-criticised Saudi-backed Asian professional tour, has been especially lucrative. But Shark leaves us with the sense that there’s still something missing, an emptiness inside that drives Norman on. Many of the film’s most memorable scenes show Norman back at Augusta today, playing 18 holes alone, heightening the sense that his greatest rival was not Faldo or Nicklaus but himself. At the age of 67, Norman still looks as trim as he was in his pomp: the stance is as firm, the swing as free. Under grey skies, across a perfectly empty course, he replays all the clutch shots from his 1986, 1987, and 1996 collapses, and executes them perfectly.

4/18/2022,"Earlier that day she had presided over the US Senate confirmation of the supreme court justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who would mark the occasion by quoting poetry: “I am the dream and the hope of the slave.” Then, in the evening, Vice-President Kamala Harris headed to the National Gallery of Art in Washington for a reception celebrating the opening of Afro-Atlantic Histories, a landmark exhibition that explores the brutal history of the transatlantic slave trade and cultural legacy of the African diaspora. Harris – whose father is from Jamaica and mother from India – declared the show “unlike any other in the National Gallery’s history”, adding: “This is world history and it is American history. And, for many of us, it is also family history. Yet this history is rarely taught in our schools or shown in our museums.” The vice-presidential visit was a thrill for co-curator Kanitra Fletcher. She says of Harris: “She was really lovely, very warm. We only were supposed to give her a tour for 20 minutes and it ended up being 45. She was genuinely interested.” Afro-Atlantic Histories contains more than 130 works from Africa, Europe, the Americas and the Caribbean, dating from the 17th century to the 21st. It includes leading African American artists Aaron Douglas, Theaster Gates and Kerry James Marshall as well as Eustáquio Neves of Brazil, Canute Caliste of Grenada and Senèque Obin of Haiti. The first and last works in the exhibition form powerful bookends. Visitors are greeted by Hank Willis Thomas’s 8ft-tall stainless-steel wall sculpture A Place to Call Home (Africa America Reflection), which outlines what appears to be the western hemisphere but is actually North America linked to Africa. Thomas, who made the fictional map in 2020, has spoken of how a “mythical connection to Africa is embedded in your identity, but many people go to Africa looking for home and don’t find it because our roots are so diluted there. They also never felt at home in the US, where they were born. I wanted to make a place where African Americans come from.” At the end of the show, conversely, David Hammons’ African-American Flag hangs from the ceiling. The red, white and blue of the Stars and Stripes are replaced by red, black and green, a reference to the Pan-African flag created in 1920 with the support of Marcus Garvey, founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association. Fletcher, the gallery’s associate curator of African American and Afro-Diasporic Art, comments: “Thomas is thinking about the tenuous relationship between Black Americans and Africa and America: feeling very American when they’re in Africa but then in America, because of histories of racism and discrimination, maybe not feeling like they’re home also. “Then Hammons’ work is fully merging Blackness and Africanness with American identity. In my mind he’s saying that they are one and the same, they are not exclusive of each other. It’s a much more defiant but also hopeful kind of approach to that topic. I just love it there at opposite ends of the exhibition.” Afro-Atlantic Histories was originally presented in 2018 at the Museum of Art in São Paulo in Brazil with more than 400 works at two venues. It has now been refined for a US tour and is divided into six sections by theme rather than chronology or geography. Maps and Margins, for example, evokes the early Atlantic crossings of the Black diaspora from the arrival of Portuguese slave traders in Africa to the abolition of slavery in Brazil. It serves as a reminder that this story is much bigger than the US. Between 1525 and 1866, an estimated 12.5 million Africans were violently taken from their homes and families and 10.7 million survived the Middle Passage across the Atlantic. Of these only about 388,000 were shipped directly to North America – roughly 4%. Fletcher observes: “Black Americans are often made to stand in for other Black cultures and we often are centred or we centre ourselves in discourses on Blackness. It’s important to think about how to disrupt that because most enslaved Africans do not end up in America. “All the rest ended up in South America and the Caribbean with 40% going to Brazil. So it’s a huge misunderstanding that is important to be corrected but it’s also important to see with those other Black cultures how many continuities and similarities that we also have with them.” In Enslavements and Emancipations, there are works that capture the terror – such as Restraint, a haunting 2009 etching by Kara Walker – but also endurance, uprisings and indomitable spirit. Fletcher continues: “From the inception of slavery, enslaved Africans were always fighting back, striving for freedom and liberty, and it wasn’t something that was just simply handed to them. “One of the first paintings in the enslavement section is an image by Renard, a French artist depicting an enslaved Black man – it seems he is clubbing a white trader whose leg you can kind of see in the background. Of course enslaved Africans were victims but they were still able to empower themselves to fight back for freedom.” Rites and Rhythms focuses on celebrations and ceremonies with references to various religious traditions as well as music and dance, for instance samba in Brazil, jazz in the US and Pedro Figari’s portrayals of candombe dances in Uruguay. Perhaps most spectacular is a dramatically lit room bursting with portraits of Black men, women and children from the past four centuries. There is a 1640s oil painting of Don Miguel de Castro, emissary of Congo to the Dutch Republic, a rare image of a Black person as a powerful and proud individual in elaborate European clothing. There is Njideka Akunyili Crosby’s incandescent Eko Skyscraper, which reverses a 1967 photograph of a young woman taken in Kisangani, Congo, adds a new backdrop and renders the picture in warm gradients of orange. Then there is the South African artist Zanele Muholi’s Ntozahke II, (Parktown), a giant photographic wall mural which, with loose-fitting toga-like garment and crown of scouring pads (a homage to the artist’s mother, a domestic worker), makes Muholi look like the Statue of Liberty. “It’s one of the most striking images and it immediately caught our eye,” Fletcher says. “They [Muholi] darkened their skin for this series of self-portraits as a way to assert their Blackness and that says even more about the history of the nation and the history of the Statue of Liberty and so many interesting connections that are being made. Aside from being just a gorgeous image.” The exhibition, on view until 17 July, resists a grand narrative or definitive history but contains multitudes. Fletcher concludes: “Often people think that Black cultures are counter to European culture and that is not the case. “This show demonstrates how intertwined our histories are and I hope that’s recognised: to see how European artists engaged with Black people in the past and saw them as a worthy subject matter. But also how, if it wasn’t for the presence of Black people, European culture and the modern west would not exist. “We wouldn’t be where we are today. It wouldn’t have happened without the presence of African and Black people.” Afro-Atlantic Histories is on view at the National Gallery of Art in Washington until 17 July",Arts/Art and design,‘This is rarely taught’: an exhibition examining African-Atlantic history,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/18/afro-atlantic-histories-national-gallery-of-art
4/18/2022,"Every morning, three lawyers navigate the gang-ridden, treacherous roads of Port-au-Prince to get to work. Of the women’s two priorities of the day this is the first: to get to and from the office safely. The second is fighting Haiti’s legal system from inside, trying to win justice for women who have been raped. Sexual violence linked to armed gangs in Haiti is not new but the situation has significantly deteriorated since the assassination of the president last year, which has left the country in a power vacuum. The Bureau des Avocats Internationaux (BAI) in Haiti’s capital, a human rights law organisation, was set up in the wake of the dramatic rise in sexual attacks predominantly on women in the displacement camps set up after the 2010 earthquake. The lawyers – Derolian, Marie Kattia Dorestant-Lefruy and Gladys Thermezi – help victims through the legal process, from lodging a statement at the police station to preparing the case and representing them at trial – if there is one. Of the 528 cases they’ve worked on since the 2010 earthquake, only 10 have gone to trial. “When you live in a society with a lot of problems, women and girls always suffer. In such a situation, gangs use women as weapons of war to get revenge, to show what they’re capable of,” saysAbigail Derolian. “We’re not a country that promotes human rights, particularly women’s rights. Women don’t know that they can live with dignity, that they can get justice. We have a lot of women who are raped, and we know that the majority remain silent because they’re afraid.” An assessment of Haiti by the UN high commission for human rights in 2021 found gang-related sexual violence was increasing. “Rape was used as a weapon to humiliate, terrorise and reinforce the control of gang members over local populations. In some areas, the feeling of impunity is so pervasive that rapes have been perpetrated in broad daylight,” it said. Karlyn*, who is being supported by BAI, was attacked during the day by two men. “I had to resign from my work at a garment factory and move to the countryside because gang members were looking for me,” she says. Her case is waiting at the state prosecutor’s office. In its latest figures published last March, the UN estimates 23% of married or cohabiting women will be sexually or physically abused by a partner in their lifetime. Last year, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said the number of recorded cases in Haiti increased by 377% in 2020. BAI, in partnership with the US-based Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, offersmuch-needed support. Women are referred from organisations such as Médecins Sans Frontières, who provide initial medical care after an attack, and from an extensive network of community support workers. “We have an obstacle in getting justice and that is the judicial system. We are fighting the system. We work double the hours to make sure the victim won’t be discouraged. We don’t stop investigating,” Thermezi says. Corruption, stigma and victim-blaming is rife, the lawyers say. Bribery is all too common in the courts while judges will ask questions such as: “What were you doing out at this hour of the day? What were you wearing? Isn’t this a love affair?” The BAI lawyers remain steadfast. “I come from a poor, voiceless family and I’m happy to defend women who don’t have anyone to speak out for them and who don’t have money for legal services,” says Dorestant-Lefruy. “We face a lot of obstacles in getting justice for women … but the work gives me the strength and courage to speak up for these women.” * Name has been changed Sign up for Her Stage to hear directly from incredible women in the developing world on the issues that matter to them, delivered to your inbox monthly:",News/Global development,‘We are fighting the system’: Haiti lawyers taking rape to the courts ,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/18/haiti-sexual-violence-rape-gangs-victims-women-lawyers
