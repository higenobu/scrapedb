12/24/2021,"The risk of being admitted to hospital is up to 70% less for people with Omicron compared to those infected with Delta, according to the first UK government study of its kind. People with Omicron are estimated to be between 31% and 45% less likely to go to A&E compared with those with Delta, and 50% to 70% less likely to require admission to hospital, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). The early findings, described as “encouraging” and “promising”, are consistent with analysis published on Wednesday by Imperial College London and the University of Edinburgh.  However, health leaders also warned that cases in the UK continued to increase at an “extraordinary rate” and that the sheer numbers of people becoming infected could still result in a significant number of people becoming seriously ill, and the risk of the NHS becoming overwhelmed. The UKHSA said the new variant was more transmissible than previous ones such as Delta, and could still lead to significant numbers of people needing hospital treatment over the coming weeks. The new data emerged after the UK experienced yet another record-breaking number of daily reported Covid cases, with 119,789 reported as of 9am on Thursday. Dr Jenny Harries, the chief executive of the UKHSA, said: “Our latest analysis shows an encouraging early signal that people who contract the Omicron variant may be at a relatively lower risk of hospitalisation than those who contract other variants. However, it should be noted both that this is early data and more research is required to confirm these findings. “Cases are currently very high in the UK, and even a relatively low proportion requiring hospitalisation could result in a significant number of people becoming seriously ill. The best way that you can protect yourself is to come forward for your first two doses of vaccine, or your booster jab and do everything you can to stop onward transmission of the infection.” The Omicron variant of Covid-19 is less likely to result in severe disease and hospital admission, the UKHSA data suggests. The preliminary findings of its research into the new variant confirm Omicron appears to result in less severe disease for those infected with it. However, Omicron is believed to be infecting more people who have previously had Covid, with 9.5% of people with Omicron having had the virus before. Vaccination is also believed to give less protection against Omicron, although a booster jab provides more protection against symptomatic disease compared with the first two doses alone. The preliminary UKHSA data suggests protection starts to wane 10 weeks after booster vaccination. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, said: “This new UKHSA data on Omicron is promising – while two doses of the vaccine aren’t enough, we know boosters offer significant protection against the variant and early evidence suggests this strain may be less severe than Delta. “However, cases of the variant continue to rise at an extraordinary rate – already surpassing the record daily number in the pandemic. Hospital admissions are increasing, and we cannot risk the NHS being overwhelmed.”",News/World news,"Hospital admission risk up to 70% less with Omicron than Delta, UKHSA finds",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/hospital-admission-risk-up-to-70-less-with-omicron-than-delta-ukhsa-finds
12/24/2021,"Joan Didion, the eminent journalist, author and documenter of contemporary America, has died at her home in Manhattan, New York, the New York Times has reported. She was 87 years old. The cause of death was Parkinson’s disease, according to an email sent to the newspaper by Paul Bogaards, an executive at Didion’s publisher Knopf.  Known for her pioneering blend of the personal and the political in her journalism and essays, Didion became a household name with her writing on US society. A standout female figure in the very male New Journalism movement alongside Tom Wolfe, Truman Capote and Gay Talese, Didion cast her precise eye over both American society and her own life in writing that was collected in books including Slouching Towards Bethlehem and The White Album. Famous for her detached, sometimes elegiac tone, Didion returned to alienation and isolation throughout her career, whether she was exploring her own grief after the death of her husband John Gregory Dunne in the Pulitzer-winning The Year of Magical Thinking, the emptiness of Hollywood life in the novel Play It As It Lays, or expats caught up in central American politics in her novel A Book of Common Prayer. Born in Sacramento in 1934, Didion spent her early childhood free from the restrictions of school, with her father’s job in the Army Air Corps taking the family all over the country. A “nervous” child with a tendency to headaches, Didion nonetheless began her path early, starting her first notebook when she was five. While her father was stationed in Colorado Springs, she took to walking around the psychiatric hospital that backed on to their home garden, recording conversations that she’d later work into stories. In a 2003 interview with the Guardian, she recalled an incident when she was 10: while writing a story about a woman who killed herself by walking into the ocean, she “wanted to know what it would feel like, so I could describe it” and almost drowned on a California beach. She never told her parents. (“I think the adults were playing cards.”) From reading Ernest Hemingway and Henry James, she learned to dedicate time to crafting a perfect sentence; she taught herself to use a typewriter by copying out the former’s stories. “Writing is the only way I’ve found that I can be aggressive,” she once said. “I’m totally in control of this tiny, tiny world.” In 1956, after majoring in English literature at the University of California, Berkeley, she won Vogue’s writing contest when she was 21, which led to a seven-year stint working at the magazine’s offices in New York. There she met Dunne – they’d marry when she was 29 – and between New York and Los Angeles, she began to mix with many famous contemporaries who would become friends, colleagues and rivals: Sylvia Plath, Roman Polanski, Janis Joplin (who crashed a house party), Christopher Isherwood (who called her “Mrs Misery” in his diaries), Warren Beatty and Natalie Wood (who shared her clothes with Didion). In 1963, her first book was published: the novel Run, River. In 1966, Didion and Dunne relocated to Los Angeles and adopted a baby girl, Quintana Roo, named after the Mexican state. Her first collection of essays, Slouching Towards Bethlehem was published in 1968: with its title essay about Haight-Ashbury’s hippy community, the collection established Didion’s voice as exceptional; in the New York Times’s review at the time, Dan Wakefield called Didion, “one of the least celebrated and most talented writers of my own generation”. In the book, Didion famously rubbished her own skills at interviewing and reporting: “My only advantage as a reporter is that I am so physically small, so temperamentally unobtrusive, and so neurotically inarticulate that people tend to forget my presence runs counter to their best interests. And it always does.” Didion followed it up with her novel about life in Hollywood, Play It As It Lays, which she later adapted into a screenplay with Dunne; the couple often worked together on screenplays, including the 1976 film A Star Is Born. A smattering of fiction would follow over the next two decades – A Book of Common Prayer (1977), Democracy (1984) and The Last Thing He Wanted (1996) – but non-fiction dominated. Her second essay collection, The White Album (1979) contained her most famous line: “We tell ourselves stories in order to live.” In 1983 came Salvador, a book-length essay about a trip she took to El Salvador with Dunne; Miami (1987), about the city’s Cuban expat community; After Henry (1992), a collection dedicated to Didion’s editor Henry Robbins; and Political Fictions (2001), which spanned the elections of US presidents George HW Bush, Bill Clinton and George W Bush. Over decades, the diminutive Didion built her own mythology; more than one journalist, when interviewing her, noted her quietness and frail frame with surprise. Her elegant style and interest in fashion, fostered at Vogue, also saw her revered as a a symbol of “cool”; at the age of 80, she became the face of French fashion house Céline. From the 1980s onwards, Didion focused on politics, coining the term “the permanent political class” to describe the fraternity of media, politicians and strategists that shape the US’s self-image. After Clinton’s impeachment, she wrote: “No one who ever passed through an American high school could have watched William Jefferson Clinton running for office in 1992 and failed to recognise the familiar predatory sexuality of the provincial adolescent.” Among Washington journalists, she wrote, “what ‘fairness’ has often come to mean is a scrupulous passivity, an agreement to cover the story not as it is occurring but as it is presented, which is to say as it is manufactured.” “For me, writing is a kind of exploration,” Didion told the Guardian in 2003. “I’m not sure that I have a social conscience. It’s more an insistence that people tell the truth.” When Dunne died of a heart attack in 2003, Didion began writing The Year of Magical Thinking, an exploration of her grief at his death while, at the same time, their daughter Quintana was severely ill in hospital. Unsparingly documenting her resulting strange habits, such as keeping Dunne’s shoes for when he “came back”, the book won her a Pulitzer prize. Months after it came out in 2005, her daughter Quintana died from acute pancreatitis aged 39, which Didion would write about in her 2011 reflection on ageing and parenting, Blue Nights. When she was presented with her National Medal of Arts and the National Humanities medal in 2012, President Barack Obama told the room: “I’m surprised she hasn’t already gotten this award.” In her later years, Didion wrote less; her most recent project was as the subject of Joan Didion: The Center Will Not Hold, a 2018 Netflix documentary made by her nephew, Griffin Dunne. Her final book, South and West, was a collection of her notes while travelling around Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana in the 1970s; when it was released in 2017, it was marketed as a prescient take on the then newly elected president Donald Trump’s base of voters. Talking to the Guardian when it was released, Didion said: “I suppose the crisis in American politics was behind everything I was thinking, whether or not I knew I was thinking it. These things have a way of creeping in. I think we currently are living through the scariest of times.”",Arts/Books,"Joan Didion, American journalist and author, dies at age 87",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/23/joan-didion-american-journalist-and-author-dies-at-age-87
12/24/2021,"Evidence that infections caused by Omicron may be less severe than other Covid variants is good news but is likely to make little or no difference to the duration of the pandemic, according to experts. Several pieces of research published this week suggest that people infected with Omicron are much less likely to require hospitalisation.  Those with the variant are estimated to be between 31% and 45% less likely to attend A&E compared with the Delta variant, and 50% to 70% less likely to be require admission to hospital, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said on Thursday. Separately, researchers at the University of Edinburgh studied infections from the Delta and Omicron variants since November and said the results “suggest that Omicron is associated with a two-thirds reduction in the risk of Covid-19 hospitalisation when compared with Delta”. But experts warned that the results suggested no change in the level of infection. In the UK, the huge surge in cases – with another 119,789 new infections reported on Thursday – means that even if only a small proportion of people with Covid need to attend hospital, it could cause difficulties for the NHS. Mark Woolhouse, a professor at the University of Edinburgh and one of the co-authors of the Scotland study, said the weight of new research meant that projections would be less pessimistic, although Omicron’s rapid spread meant there were still dangers ahead. “It’s good but it doesn’t get us out of the woods. Severity of infection is clearly very important but it is only one factor in terms of the public health burden,” Woolhouse said, speaking in a personal capacity. “The other thing is the sheer size of the wave. The simple way of looking at that, according to our data in Scotland, is an Omicron infection is about one-third as severe or likely to put you in hospital as a Delta infection. But if there are three times as many cases, then we are back where we started. “We should still be worried about the sheer size of the wave, the very fast growth rates, very fast doubling time. These peak numbers of cases that we have seen in the UK are still climbing, so it is the size of that wave that is worrying people most at the moment.” Dr Raghib Ali, a senior clinical research associate at the University of Cambridge, told Reuters that the hospital data was encouraging and “may help justify the government’s decision not to expand restrictions on social gathering over Christmas in England”. Another scientist, who did not want to be named because of involvement in ongoing research, said Omicron infections were going to be “hugely disruptive” because of the numbers needing to self-isolate “There’s a tremendous impact on the NHS because of the workforce getting infections,” they said. “But obviously it’s good news if a smaller fraction of those infections lead to severe illness.” Separate research published by scientists at Imperial College London found a reduction in hospital visits between Omicron and Delta cases, and estimated that those infected with Omicron were 40%-45% less likely to be hospitalised overnight than those with Delta. But the study also suggested that two doses of a Covid vaccine were not enough to combat Omicron alone. Prof Neil Ferguson, one of the co-authors of the Imperial study, said: “Given the high transmissibility of the Omicron virus, there remains the potential for health services to face increasing demand if Omicron cases continue to grow at the rate that has been seen in recent weeks.” Woolhouse said there remained substantial gaps in scientists’ knowledge of Omicron, such as how the UK’s booster campaign would affect the spread of infection. “Particularly, whether [boosters] not only stop people getting ill but also stop them getting infected and passing the infection on. That would also be very helpful – at the moment we don’t know that it has much impact on the spread of these cases,” Woolhouse said. “If it did have an impact on the spread of cases that would be further good news, and that would affect the size of the wave and therefore the public health burden.”",News/World news,"Good news is Omicron may be less severe, bad news is it’s surging faster",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/23/good-news-is-omicron-may-be-less-severe-bad-news-its-surging-faster
12/24/2021,"A hardship charity once chaired by Charles Dickens says shop workers are seeking its help due to the financial pain caused by the end of the universal credit uplift, fewer hours and the absence of sick pay. The Fashion and Textile Children’s Trust (FTCT) steps in to assist children whose parents work in the fashion industry but are struggling to make ends meet.  Anna Pangbourne, the charity’s chief executive, said the drop in visitors to stores and shopping centres this Christmas and speculation about new Covid restrictions were causing fresh anxiety about job security. The withdrawal of the £20-a-week universal credit top-up, which was introduced after the first lockdown, had been a “shock” for families, some of whom had got into debt during the pandemic said Pangbourne. “The effects of the initial lockdown are going to be felt for a long time,” she said. “We are continuing to reach out to industry families who don’t have the safety net of sick pay or savings.” In 2021 the charity received nearly 2,500 applications for grants, after a record 3,516 inquiries in 2020, when the high street was rocked by the failure of big employers Debenhams and Sir Philip Green’s Arcadia and the first wave of pandemic store closures. Families told the charity that the cut to universal credit had been felt keenly because most had started claiming it when the uplift was in place. Others said they had not received sick pay when off isolating or their children were ill or quarantining. This week, as part of its £1bn package of emergency financial support for hospitality and leisure businesses, the government reopened the statutory sick pay rebate scheme, which refunds companies with up to 250 employees for payment to staff. The rapid spread of the Omicron variant has seen the union Usdaw call on the government to review sick pay provisions. Those who qualify for statutory sick pay receive £96.35 a week, but the retail workers’ union wants the payment to be based on normal earnings. The end of the furlough job support scheme meant people had returned to work but were often receiving fewer hours, the charity said, with the accompanying reduction in pay affecting their ability to pay bills and replace broken household appliances at a time when the cost of living is soaring. The charity, which was founded in 1853 by a group of philanthropic textile merchants to support the bereaved family of a colleague, helped 713 families in its last financial year. Its average grant is about £500, which Pangbourne said was used to provide children with “hot meals, comfy beds and warm clothes”. The work of the charity, originally called the Purley Children’s Trust, attracted the attention of Charles Dickens who chaired its appeal board from 1856 to 1857.",News/Business,"Shop workers experiencing financial hardship and job insecurity, says charity",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/23/shop-workers-experiencing-financial-hardship-and-job-insecurity-says-charity
12/24/2021,"Boris Johnson entered the fraught festive period with his authority in tatters after a string of self-inflicted crises, and with colleagues warning that cancelling Christmas could be the final straw for the exasperated British public. So early, tentative evidence that the Omicron variant may result in less severe health outcomes is the best Christmas present the prime minister could have hoped for.  Downing Street sources expressed caution about over-interpreting the data, with experts continuing to warn that the sheer size of the Omicron wave could still put severe pressure on the NHS, even if a smaller proportion of those infected end up in hospital. But there is now hope that at the very least, the decision on whether to impose strict new restrictions after Christmas may not be cut and dried. The devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have each announced a package of new rules from Boxing Day, ranging from limits on the largest outdoor events to the return of social distancing. Johnson was under pressure from Labour and the Liberal Democrats to give families and businesses in England similar clarity by setting out his plans for the post-Christmas period. But ministers have said they do not yet have the data to act, and the cabinet has not been reconvened since a lengthy, inconclusive meeting on Monday. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, has confirmed there will be no further announcements from the government this week. This wait-and-see approach received the endorsement of the former Labour prime minister Tony Blair, who told Times Radio on Wednesday that he would not have introduced restrictions over Christmas. Blair argued that from a purely public health perspective the case for curbs was strong, but Omicron was so transmissible that only a full lockdown would be likely to have much effect, and this was too much of a “blunt instrument” to apply across the board to different categories of people, including the triple-jabbed. Johnson will now be hoping hospitalisations and other data provide a sufficient glimmer of hope to avoid a new year circuit breaker or other measures, such as limits on mixing. Having promised MPs the opportunity to vote on any restrictions, he would only be likely to get them through with the backing of Labour. That would delight the new shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, whose tactic has been to offer staunch support for government measures while highlighting the Tories’ divisions. Even if the data falls the right way and Johnson is able to avoid imposing fresh restrictions in the new year, however, Tory backbenchers appear unlikely to credit him for standing firm. Instead, the lockdown sceptics believe the prime minister was left with little room for manoeuvre after the historic rebellion against his plan B measures last week, which strengthened the arm of sceptical cabinet ministers. At the height of the Covid crisis in 2020 there was little cabinet consultation, with key decisions on draconian lockdown measures being made by an inner circle of Johnson, senior ministers and close advisers, while the full cabinet acted as little more than a rubber stamp. But Johnson’s power over his party is now considerably less secure, so that – as during Theresa May’s troubled premiership – the content of cabinet meetings is readily leaked, with jockeying rivals briefing their contributions to the press. Johnson will be sincerely relieved if England can start the new year free of harsh restrictions that could further batter his popularity, and he may even hope that, as with last year’s vaccine bounce, the end of the Omicron wave boosts the public mood. And it will certainly save him a fresh confrontation with battle-hardened backbenchers. But the pressure from within Johnson’s party over everything from political mismanagement to lockdown-busting parties, and from MPs looking at the North Shropshire result and fearing for their own future, is unlikely to abate.",News/Politics,Omicron news is boost for Boris Johnson but Tory pressure is still on,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/23/omicron-news-is-boost-for-boris-johnson-but-tory-pressure-is-still-on
12/24/2021,"Allowing women to give birth in hospital with their pet dog by their side could ease their anxiety, one of the first women to use a “birth dog” has said. Charlotte Beard, 24, who suffers from non-epileptic seizures, was supported through her 50-hour labour by her aid pet Flump, who is trained to detect seizures before they happen.  The fluffy-haired Maltese was prepared for the birth by being played audio tracks of babies crying at home and being introduced to staff at the maternity ward in Poole hospital. “I would say you can’t really do a practice run,” Beard joked. “He was visiting the maternity hospital on a very regular basis, getting to know staff, getting to know the different rooms and the setups. Even things like the different equipment that was going to be used, he would see that used on a regular basis.” Flump, two, attended every scan and every appointment alongside Beard. It is a legal requirement that assistance dogs are allowed into hospitals, but Beard said a lot of hospitals were not aware of this. “It would have caused high levels of anxiety if Flump was not there,” she said. “I would have certainly been more concerned about my safety. “I am not suggesting that if I were to have a seizure, staff would not have been able to look after me. But no staff member can detect beforehand whether you are going to have a seizure or not. That is something that Flump can do that nobody else can, and it gives them such valuable time to make sure that I am safe and have the right support in place before it happens. Prevention is always much better than treatment.” Beard gave birth to her son Alfie, weighing 6lb 10oz, after two days with Flump. Her partner and full-time carer, Ash Phoenix, 29, was present. Beard, a former wildlife rehabilitator who had to stop work due to her health, said Flump sat patiently at the end of the bed during the birth and then took in his stride the following days spent in the maternity ward. “We would regularly hear quite distressing noises and he was absolutely fantastic,” she said. “He slept through [a] lot of other people’s labours.” Beard said she was not sure whether she was the first woman in the UK to have an assistance pet present during birth, but the hospital where Alfie was born had certainly never allowed it before. Staff had to do lots of research and set up risk assessments before Flump could attend, she said. The idea of having a dog present had been put to Beard, who had studied animal behaviour and training, by a doctor. It was thought that having a dog at her side might give her more confidence. Beard had had three miscarriages previously and worried about having traumatic memories on her return to hospital. Beard got Flump at 10 weeks and has trained him since then. “From a human standpoint I cannot help but think how lovely it is that Flump was there. He was one of the first to see Alfie,” Beard said. “Obviously hormones play a great part in it. Being present there from the birth and meeting Alfie within moments of him being born, whether it has increased the bond or not, it was such a lovely experience for everyone. Flump was absolutely besotted with Alfie from the moment he first saw him.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,UK woman has baby in hospital with ‘birth dog’ by her side,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/23/uk-woman-delivers-baby-in-hospital-with-birth-dog-by-her-side
12/24/2021,"Another 119,789 people have tested positive for Covid within 24 hours in the UK, the highest figure since the pandemic began, as the highly infectious Omicron variant continues to drive infections. The figure represents a 139% rise on the 50,023 new cases recorded on Thursday two weeks ago. Wednesday was the first time the UK had recorded more than 100,000 Covid cases.  A further 147 people died from Covid-related causes, and the number of deaths remains relatively stable. It takes the UK’s total death toll for people with Covid on their death certificate to 171,801, the seventh highest in the world. NHS England’s national medical director, Stephen Powis, said the health service was “on a war footing and staff are taking the fight to Omicron”. The number of staff days lost to Covid across NHS England hit 124,855 last week, a 38% jump from the 90,277 of the week before, according to data published by NHS England. “We are once again ramping up to deal with the rise in Covid infections and, quite rightly, staff are making every possible preparation for the uncertain challenges of Omicron,” Powis said. In response to the staffing crisis, the UK health secretary, Sajid Javid, cut the self-isolation period from 10 to seven days if people get two negative Covid tests. “There is increased pressure in many workforces at the moment, especially if someone needs to isolate if they have a positive case,” he said. Javid said ministers would not be imposing any fresh restrictions in England before Christmas.

12/24/2021,"Tributes have been paid to Jon Snow, known to TV viewers for his loud ties and calm anchoring of Channel 4 News for more than three decades, as the 74-year-old journalist signs off on his last programme. Snow, whose memorable appearances have ranged from grilling government ministers to reports from war zones, will continue to work with Channel 4 on long-form projects and spend more time focusing on his charitable work.  Prior to Snow’s final bulletin on Thursday evening, a colleague shared a photo on Twitter of him looking out across the newsroom. “Going to be an emotional day, our last shift working together, before the Channel 4 News lights dim at 8pm,” wrote Hayley Barlow, the Channel 4 News communications director. Krishnan Guru-Murthy, a member of the Channel 4 News presenting team, described Snow on Twitter as an “extraordinary human being, who’s been there at some of the most amazing moments of history.” He wrote: “He’s always been the most energetic, enthusiastic, committed and questioning TV journalist – who has brought compassion and humanity to his reporting wherever he goes. Viewers love him. And even those politicians who disagree and get angry with him respect him.” The Channel 4 News correspondent Ciaran Jenkins shared a video of Snow performing a sea shanty that went viral on TikTok earlier this year. “The legendary @jonsnowC4 presents @Channel4News for the last time tonight. A superb journalist, unique communicator and an inspiration to so many of us,” he said. Referencing the lyrics of the shanty, Jenkins added: “‘One day when the tonguing is done we’ll take our leave and go.’ “We’ll miss you so much Jon.” The ITV News presenter Lucrezia Millarini described Snow as a legend, adding: “Wow. A constant on-screen presence in my household growing up. Then I was lucky enough to work in the same building.” Snow, whose father was the bishop of Whitby, started his career in journalism at LBC in 1973 and moved to ITN in 1976, where he served as Washington correspondent and diplomatic editor. He became the main presenter of Channel 4 News in 1989. Channel 4 has previously said Snow will now “focus on his charities and some of his many passions in life, people’s stories, inequality, Africa, Iran and the arts”.

12/24/2021,"Flutter, the gambling company that owns Paddy Power and SkyBet, has agreed to buy the Italian operator Sisal in a £1.6bn deal that could have a significant bearing on the competition to run the UK’s national lottery. In a statement to the stock market, Flutter said it had struck a deal with the private equity group CVC Partners to buy Sisal, a major Italian gambling and betting firm which also operates lotteries in Italy, Turkey and Morocco.  The Flutter chief executive, Peter Jackson, said buying the Milan-based firm would give the company a “gold medal position” in Italy, the second-largest regulated gambling market in Europe, after the UK. Flutter said Sisal was fast-growing, particularly in online gambling, which increased by 20% in Italy as the Covid-19 pandemic drove punters to migrate online. The takeover puts Flutter, whose brands include Betfair, Paddy Power and SkyBet, in contention to take over the UK national lottery. Sisal is one of four firms bidding for the next 10-year licence to run the lottery. The Gambling Commission is expected to make a decision in February 2022 after a competition that has been prolonged several times, with the new licence due to start in 2024. Sisal is up against Camelot, which has run the Lottery since its inception in 1994, and the media tycoon Richard Desmond, who already owns the Health Lottery. The biggest threat to Camelot’s 27-year incumbency is thought to be the Czech operator Sazka, which is bidding via a special purpose vehicle set up in the UK called Allwyn. All of the bidders have submitted their final proposals and are waiting for the Gambling Commission’s decision. However, Flutter did not mention the UK lottery in a statement attached to the announcement of its takeover of Sisal. The Guardian understands that Flutter has not factored the bid into its plans. The takeover is not due to complete until April, by which time the national lottery decision will have been made. While the Gambling Commission oversees all gambling activity in the UK, including lotteries, sports betting and casino games, it has typically treated the national lottery as a separate entity with specialist staff devoted to it. Flutter is also the subject of an investigation by the commission, after the Guardian revealed that its SkyVegas brand offered “free spins” to recovering addicts. If Flutter is not considered a suitable firm to run the lottery, that would leave Camelot, Sazka and Richard Desmond fighting it out for the lucrative 10-year licence. Camelot has faced criticism, including from a parliamentary public accounts committee (PAC) report in 2018, that charitable donations have not always risen as fast as profits under its tenure. In the first year of the current lottery licence, Camelot booked an after-tax profit of £31.5m after ticket sales amounted to £5.45bn, raising more than £1.5bn for good causes. In the year that so exercised the PAC, 2016-17, Camelot’s profit was more than twice as high at £70m but it raised only a little more for good causes, about £1.6bn. Since then, Camelot has rebalanced things somewhat. Profits for the year to March 2021 have not been published in full but are thought to have reached £80m on the back of record sales of £8.37bn, with good-cause money also hitting an all-time high of £1.85bn. In the first half of the current financial year, to 30 September, Camelot recorded sales of £3.9bn, up 2.7% compared with the same period in 2020. The amount Camelot returned to good causes was £884.5m, up 2.4% on the previous year.",News/UK news,Flutter enters contest to run national lottery via Italian takeover,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/23/flutter-enters-contest-to-run-national-lottery-via-italian-takeover
12/24/2021,"The billionaire US hedge fund boss Dan Loeb has launched a scathing attack on activist investors targeting his London-listed fund, calling them “juvenile” and “underhanded” after its chair resigned. Loeb’s New York-based Third Point is one of the most prominent and aggressive activist hedge funds, which take stakes in companies to push for changes that they believe will make them more valuable. Loeb has tussled with companies ranging from Sony to Sotheby’s and Prudential, and he is now agitating for a break-up of Shell.  However, in an unusual twist, it is Loeb’s London fund that is now the target of activist investors, triggering an extraordinary public spat between investment firms. Steve Bates, the chair since 2019, stepped down after claiming that he had received “personal threats” from a shareholder in a meeting who said they would “attack him in other business areas”, Third Point said. Third Point Investors was listed in 2007 to give UK investors easy access to returns from Loeb’s main hedge fund. It had a market value £680m on Wednesday, but Asset Value Investors (AVI), the largest shareholder after Loeb with a 10% stake, says poor management meant it was undervalued compared with its holdings. Third Point said in a statement to the stock market on Thursday that it had held meetings with AVI and other investors, including a firm called Staude Capital. It did not identify the source of the alleged threat. Third Point said the threat raised a “business conflict” for Bates if he continued as chair. Loeb, who is worth $4bn (£3bn) according to Forbes magazine and who has himself been criticised for his hard-driving activism, used the same stock market notice to attack his adversaries. He said: “The behaviour by these so-called ‘activists’ is a stain on institutional investors who attempt to engage constructively with boards and management teams. Being a successful activist requires moving on when shareholders reject your plans rather than resorting to underhanded tactics. These juvenile antics smack of desperation and inexperience.” Tom Treanor, a director at AVI, said in a statement the firm had supported Bates’s original appointment to the board, and it was “unfortunate that he has now chosen to resign”. He claimed that Bates had “felt under pressure from the manager”, Loeb, and also accused Third Point of putting out “misleading narratives”. This included Third Point’s description of a victory earlier this month in a vote over one of the London fund’s directors that was brought by AVI. Treanor said the vote was won only because a Third Point company controlled voting rights. He said that raised “serious questions around governance at the company”.",News/Business,Activist hedge fund furious after ‘juvenile’ attack by activist investors,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/23/activist-hedge-fund-furious-after-juvenile-attack-by-activist-investor
12/24/2021,"Three intensive care workers share the stories that have remained hidden from public view during the pandemic.  It was an eye opener seeing young people come in with severe respiratory illnesses. We’re used to managing people with respiratory diseases, but not to the extent they were almost on death’s door. We had to talk to patients on the phone, or, if we were in the room, wearing PPE. They couldn’t have family members or friends so it was really tough on them. It was heartbreaking seeing patients with their whole families in hospital, but they were spread throughout Sydney. Sometimes they hadn’t had any contact until a FaceTime or Skype call. Having to talk to family members on the phone and trying to relay how sick their family member was, or tell them they were going to pass away, was a really challenging time. In my culture – I’m Tongan – it’s very family oriented, and seeing Pacific islander families coming into hospital, and knowing that’s what they needed, I think some felt a bit more reassured someone could speak to them in their own language. One of the patients I remember was really quite sick. We were getting him sent to the intensive care unit. He was a young guy, I was on the phone to his wife wheeling him out and he said to me: ‘doctor, am I going to die?’. And I thought in my mind, ‘you could’, but I had to reassure him we were doing everything we could and we were sending him to intensive care to get the treatment he needed. We had a mixed model on the ward – [first we] utilised the negative pressure rooms, then we installed bubbles, then we transitioned the rest of the patients out, and we went full Covid. It was all staff in full PPE from the minute they arrived. We set up a donning station outside of the ward and had particular nurses supervising the procedure. Their background is neurology, stroke, brain injury and suddenly they were taking patients with respiratory issues – and they just took it in their stride. The acute patients were very unwell, and it is extremely labour-intensive on the nurses working in those areas, particularly in the bubbles. It’s such a different way of nursing, it’s like a tent on the outside of the four-bedded bay so they’d be zipping through two sets of tent to get into the patient … It’s extremely hot, really dehydrating for the nurses because they’ve got the full PPE on and it steams up really quickly. We did a transfer late one night, we had about 32 patients on the ward at the time, it was just a particularly busy day, patients were really sick and they deteriorated quickly with the Delta strain … It really hit home seeing how many patients were in and how sick they were. It was very different to getting on the bus and heading home to what was going on inside the hospitals. The public were protected from that. When Covid came, particularly with the second wave, our work changed completely. It was really a once-in-career type experience. I’ve never seen anything like it before, and most of my colleagues haven’t either. We went from being a 20 bed ICU which had two pods in it … to suddenly having to expand to a four pod ICU to accommodate our Covid patients. We also provide services for Covid patients with very severe lung problems who can’t be looked after in other hospitals … so even though there weren’t a huge number of Covid patients in our local community who needed ICU, we were seeing patients from all across New South Wales. Our workload increased exponentially … We needed many more nursing staff, more doctors, more equipment and more space and all of this came with its logistical challenges. The moments that stood out were when we had a patient dying without their family being able to be there with them … Having to be their healthcare workers but their family at the same time as well, you really feel that level of humanity comes out at the time.",News/Australia news,"Life on the ward: ‘He said to me: doctor, am I going to die?’",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/24/life-on-the-ward-he-said-to-me-doctor-am-i-going-to-die
12/24/2021,"Bernard and the Genie, a 1991 British made-for-television fantasy-comedy, is a Christmas sleeper with an impressive pedigree. The script, written by a young Richard Curtis, is a rollicking tale of good versus evil delivered by an impressive cast of comedians including Lenny Henry, Rowan Atkinson and Alan Cumming.  The opening scene takes place 2,000 years ago in an era of vengeful sorcerers, evil spells and, confusingly, Jesus of Nazareth. Bethlehem circa AD30 is not the kind of place you would normally associate with magic lamps and flying carpets but, if it’s cinéma vérité you’re after, this is not the film for you. A wizard’s curse on man-mountain Josephus (Henry) transforms him into a tiny genie who must remain in a magic lamp for eternity. Or at least until a heartbroken Bernard Bottle (Cumming) finds the lamp, his last remaining possession after his two-timing girlfriend has cleared out their apartment and moved in with his best friend. Earlier that day Bernard, a fledgling art dealer, discovered some priceless works belonging to a couple of naive old ladies. His workmates fete him with flowers, champagne and kisses on his arrival that morning to the accompaniment of a song titled Mr Success, memorable for its classic 90s line “From the shine on his shoe to the star in his eye / If he were a girl he’d be Princess Di.” To Bernard’s dismay, his honest intentions to compensate the women result not in an expected promotion from his boss, Charles Pinkworth (a superbly waspish Atkinson), but in a direction to get his “philanthropic little arse” out of the gallery. And so we find an unemployed Bernard at day’s end, stripped of flowers, champagne and worldly possessions, rubbing a lamp with the cuff of his shirt – thus causing it to explode – and winding up in an emergency ward with a bang to the head and one slightly scorched testicle. On his return to his apartment, he’s greeted by a shadowy presence that turns out to be a sabre-wielding, two-metre-tall genie with murder on his mind. “Your wish is my command,” snarls the genie. “Beware, oh short one. You smell of peppermint and it is time to die.” Once Bernard has confirmed that his wish is indeed the genie’s command, they call a truce and introduce themselves. On discovering that Josephus has been in the lamp for 2,000 years, Bernie introduces him to Mozart, Barry White (“What colour is this guy?” asks a besotted Josephus) and Big Macs. And Josephus introduces his diminutive master to his two kittens, fantastic pants and flying carpet rides. Bernard and the Genie alternates between buddy movie and parable as the two friends discover 1990s London at the height of the festive season, with all its rampant commercialism and material excess. “Tell me about this Christmas thing,” says Josephus. Bernard begins with the birth of Jesus. “But I knew this guy!” Josephus exclaims. He is horrified that such a “wonderful guy” was crucified. Together, he and Bernard decide to right some wrongs and “make some wishes for Big J”. They start with Pinkworth, then move on to Bernard’s ex-girlfriend and her new beau. In between, Bernard grants wishes to children in the Santa queue and a lottery win to the doorman at his apartment block. Bernard’s final grand gesture is to grant Josephus a wish. In return Josephus gives his friend a surprise gift designed to give Bernard the merriest of Christmases. It works of course – it’s from Richard Curtis, after all. Bernard and the Genie is dated, the production values are rough and the special effects are laughable. But throw in a cheesy soundtrack that includes Slade’s Merry Xmas Everybody and Bowie’s The Jean Genie and cameo appearances by 90s celebrities including Melvyn Bragg and Bob Geldof and you’ve got yourself a real cracker of a film.",Arts/Culture,Bernard and the Genie: 1991 Richard Curtis sleeper is a Christmas cracker ,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/dec/24/bernard-and-the-genie-1991-richard-curtis-sleeper-is-a-christmas-cracker
12/24/2021,"Have you been sold a pup? An increase in pet ownership through the pandemic means there are more than a million extra dogs in Australia than there were in 2019. But the fact that many people are prepared to spend big on their pets has also brought out the snake oil salespeople.  You can buy healing crystals for your collie, homeopathic junk for your jack russell, and reiki for your Rhodesian ridgeback. The anti-vaxxers have also entered the kennel. Then there are the purveyors of “natural” diets, vegan lifestyles or raw food; of massage and acupuncture and gourmet human-grade meals that cost as much as … gourmet human-grade meals. Some of what is on sale and promising wellness is total bunkum. Some is an easy way to part you from your cash and spoil your pooch. And some, such as the food, is slightly more complicated. Research from Animal Medicines Australia found the number of pet-owning households went up from 61% before Covid struck to 69% in May 2021. That includes more than a million “new” dogs. The report, Pets and the Pandemic, also found there is a lot of money at play. The average dog costs about $3,237 a year, with $58 of that spent on alternative health treatments, including acupuncture and massage. Nationally that equates to $20.5bn a year, with about $270m on alternative treatments. David Neck, a spokesperson for the Australian Veterinary Association, has been a veterinary surgeon for about 30 years. He says he has seen people lured in by false promises and warns that the market is “ripe” for those pushing unproven treatments and diets. “People believe things they read on the internet,” he says. “We have people who become instant experts in the field – they’re passing on their opinions.” Some dog breeders dig up online information that can be entirely wrong, he says, and hand it over as a guide for new owners. Neck says a breeder may have been breeding five dogs a month for years – for vets, five dogs is a morning’s work. A surprising number of websites offer crystals for dogs, spruiking a wide range of entirely unproven claims. If there is no evidence crystals work for Homo sapiens, why would they work for Canis lupus familiaris? Sure, they’re pretty. Humans might find them calming. A dog would, paws down, prefer a stick. Homeopathic products abound as well. Again, there is no evidence homeopathy works. At all. It’s not an “alternative” to anything. It’s mostly, and sometimes exclusively, water. Water is important, just don’t pay for it – fill the dog bowl from the tap. As for reiki, a roundup of studies found no evidence such “therapeutic touch” works. As with many complementary therapies, it may help humans feel better – but there’s no reason to think it would be better for a dog than a tummy rub. There are even people recommending “distance reiki” – basically sending healing thoughts. Neck says vaccinations and diets are more common and much more complicated issues for vets. Like humans, dogs need vaccines to protect against disease. And, as in the human world, some people have fallen prey to misinformation and conspiracy theories about vaccinations for dogs. In one sense, it’s simple. Vaccinations are proven, safe and effective, and side-effects are rare. But there’s a complication in the dog world – some vaccines given yearly may protect for longer than that but they are not approved to be given, say, every three years. So a dog will be considered unvaccinated after one year, unless it has a blood test, known as a titer test, that shows it is still immune. “But taking blood from a dog is done by plunging a needle into the jugular vein,” Neck says. “I’m not sure as a dog I’d like to have that done rather than a little needle.” So many vets will give the one-yearly injection even if the dog may still be immune. Some anti-vaxxers have latched on to this and spread misinformation about “vaccine overload”. The idea of vaccine overload is “questionable”, Neck says, and any concerns about adverse events are something people can talk to their vet about. The vet will also be able to say if the deadly parvovirus is in the area, for example, making vaccination more urgent. There are myriad places that advertise “alternatives” to vaccination – largely diet-based – but there is no evidence any of them work. With all the wellness palaver come, of course, diets. All sorts of them. Seafood and insect-based diets are being marketed as sustainable options for dogs. There are also vegan diets, which can be hard to get right and may be catastrophic if done badly. The biggest food trend for dogs is “raw”, which can cover fresh, freeze-dried, dehydrated, homemade or store-bought. Raw food usually has a high ratio of meat, bones and offal to vegetables, and is often marketed as “grain-free”. Producers spruik green tripe and animal penises, fat and edible bones. Raw food diets sometimes incorporate a fasting day (good luck with that). Proponents of raw food say it can do everything from giving your dog better skin and hair to better reproductive power and reduced body odour. It’s touted as more “natural”. But there is no evidence it’s any better than commercial or homemade cooked food, according to the World Small Animal Veterinary Association. Neck says if a patient comes through his door there is no way to tell whether it eats a raw or cooked diet. “I cannot measure anything on the patient … it doesn’t change anything in a measurable way,” he says. “Raw food will always run the risk of parasites and bacterial contamination.” WSAVA also warns about those risks, and earlier this year European researchers found that all the raw dog food samples they tested had bacteria, some of it antibiotic-resistant. There was also a chance the superbugs could infect humans. This year more than 20 dogs died and 44 were seriously sickened by contaminated pet meat. The RSPCA recommends against feeding dogs raw meat or bones. Commercial dry dog food that complies with voluntary Australian standards is recommended by the RSPCA, although occasionally both vegan and meat-based products have been recalled because of potential links to toxins that cause the potentially fatal condition megaesophagus. The federal government has resisted pressure for mandatory standards in the pet food industry. Neck says if owners want to feed a raw diet, they should “make it yourself, know the quality of the ingredients and how they’re handled”. And, he says, get to know your vet. That goes for vaccinations as well. Find a vet you trust, who will then know your dog’s history. Anne Chester, the chief veterinarian at RSPCA Queensland, echoes that advice. “They should develop a relationship with their vet clinic and get all their advice from the local vet,” she says. “With all things, it’s buyer beware, there’s an awful lot of information out there on the internet which is not always from reputable sources.” And Chester warns about household foods that are dangerous for doggos, with a specific Christmas warning – ham. “People need to be really careful about feeding dogs the fat off the ham. It can cause [life-threatening] pancreatitis.” In fact, be careful around any stray food this Christmas in case your beloved dog just wolfs it down.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Wellness for dogs: why your pet needs vaccines but not reiki and raw meat,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/24/wellness-for-dogs-why-your-pet-needs-vaccines-but-not-reiki-and-raw-meat
12/24/2021,"The Syncettes began in 2019 as a group of five swimming friends who met in the “latte lane” of their local swimming club in the Darwin suburb of Fannie Bay. Inspired by the British comedy film Swimming with Men, this fun-loving bunch of masters swimmers are now a retro-focused, synchronised swimming team of nine who are launching into a series of Christmas performances.  “Like the movie, it was an inspiration to have people who were all different shapes and ages who could bond and have fun,” says one of the original members, Corinne Fabian. “When we are strutting poolside in our cossies we feel really good. When the music starts and there is an audience … woohoo! We love it.” Aged between 30 and 66, the group initially trained to YouTube clips before they found 85-year-old Elaine Edwards, a synchronised swimmer in Canada in 1950. Their first performance was during the morning coffee break at the final masters swimming session in Darwin. “Up until now we have only done YMCA Christmas events but people are asking us to do private parties,” Fabian says. “And we have been approached to perform at the Darwin Waterfront and Mecure Resort. We are in demand and have developed quite a fan club.” Another Syncette, Helen Gould, says: “When we first teamed up with Elaine we did some great sessions learning the basics: sculling, floating, turning, holding your breath and swimming in a line. Elaine has been our biggest supporter and mentor.” Says Fabian: “We train all year to get a performance together and ramp it up in the last month or so. We aren’t restricted to women, we are happy to have blokes along but the only criteria is they need to attend our practices – they can’t be irregular.” The women enjoy the vintage appeal of old-style synchronised swimming, now called artistic swimming, and put a lot of work into costume selection and music. “Synchronised swimming makes us feel youthful, you get really strong in the core and it’s great for ‘tuck shop arms’,” Fabian says. “This year we were joined by a 30-year-old and we had a lot of interest but we need to find a new coach because Elaine is finding it a bit hard standing poolside. Our struggle will be to find someone to teach us the moves and technique.”",News/Australia news,"Meet the Syncettes: Darwin’s old-school, in-demand synchronised swimming squad",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/24/meet-the-syncettes-darwins-old-school-in-demand-synchronised-swimming-squad
12/24/2021,"Two weeks at Stradbroke Island was a Christmas tradition with my Dad. One that I resisted every year because none of my friends were there, leaving me feeling like the lonely older kid hanging out with my little brother’s friends. But this year was different – I was allowed to bring Jenna.  My first time with Jenna had been nervous, tentative. In the spare bedroom of our friend whose parents were away a lot, we crossed the threshold while This Year’s Love spun on CD. After that we started doing it whenever and wherever we could. To two teenagers who had just discovered sex, the whole world looked like a bed. It felt thrilling, illicit, each time like lightning. Every space – public and private – was an opportunity. My bed, her bed, behind the pool shed at a party on a surprisingly cold night. The spa in the pool area of the complex where she lived. Standing up in the change rooms at Myer Queen Street. This was how grown ups behave, we figured. It didn’t matter that the sex itself was rushed and messy, we felt warm and excited and alive, stealing moments to press ourselves together at parties while our friends necked Smirnoff Double Blacks and fell into bushes. As our list of secret sex locations grew, so did our ambition. We looked for somewhere to cap it all off. Somewhere thrilling and romantic and beautiful. It was the beach. We had to have sex on the beach. Which is how we came to be standing, at 10pm on New Year’s Eve, on a beach on Stradbroke Island, halfway through my family holiday, Havaianas in our hands and sex in our hearts. We played it cool for a few days, then on 31 December, the most romantic night of the teenage year, we made our move. After all that planning and anticipation, it was … fine. It was hard to make it work around our clothes, and the excitement wore off pretty quickly. And, the sand. Who knew a beach had so much of it? Pervasive and gritty, it quickly hardened under the compacting force of repetitive motion. So once we’d had some kisses and some thrusts, we figured we had achieved our goal and decided to go back to the unit to finish up properly in private. But sand behaves differently in different contexts. Brushed onto skin in a J.Lo music video, it’s sexy and elegant. En masse and at night, it comes to feel like cold concrete. And somewhere between those two extremes, it resembles a loosely organised, militia-like exfoliant. Seemingly everywhere, impossible to detect – until it ambushes you, in the single bed of the holiday room you share with your little brother, where you somehow swallow an entire bucket’s worth. Luckily my little brother was out all night with his nice friends, so while Jenna raced embarrassed into the shower and I gargled 18 glasses of water, we were at least granted the mercy of suffering our humiliations in private. Until now, I guess.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"A day at the beach: ‘As our list of secret sex locations grew, so did our ambition’",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/24/a-day-at-the-beach-as-our-list-of-secret-sex-locations-grew-so-did-our-ambition
12/24/2021,"Conservationists say a plan to search for oil and gas near Rowley Shoals in north-west Australia is “reckless” and will put one of the world’s healthiest reefs at risk. The area is an isolated archipelago of reefs home to three atolls – Imperieuse, Clerke, and Mermaid – that lie 260km off the coast of the Kimberley in Western Australia.  A scientific study published in April recognised Rowley Shoals’ status as a thriving marine ecosystem that has escaped the harm seen in other reef systems around the globe. The area is a biodiversity hotspot, with 96 different protected marine species living or migrating through the area, including 25 species of whales and dolphins, six types of sea turtle, 10 different shark and ray species, and 31 species of fish – including the Western Australian sculpin, a deep sea blobfish considered the ugliest animal in the world. Eighteen of the 96 species are classified as threatened or endangered. Spaced about 30km apart, Mermaid Reef is protected as a marine park under federal law, while the southern Clerke and Imperieuse reefs fall under the protection of the states. But now a Perth-based company, Seismic Searcher, has applied to conduct seismic testing to search for oil and gas across a 8,584km sq area on the doorstep of these protected areas. The proposed test will take place 4.4km from the boundary of the Mermaid Reef Marine Park and 11.9km from the Rowley Shoals Marine Park boundary. Dr Cat Dorey, marine parks campaign manager for Australian Marine Conservation Society said the effect of any testing will “bleed over” into the marine park area. “Sound waves don’t acknowledge human borders in the sea,” Dorey said. “You kind of have to wonder what is the point of a marine park where you can have oil and gas exploration going on with all of its risks?” Seismic testing involves sending regular “sound pulses” under water in short blasts to create a 3D map of what lies beneath the surface. The noise generated can reach 250 decibels as the sound waves generated by the blast penetrate the seabed. In comparison, the loudest whale noises range between 140 and 190 decibels. Seismic Searcher plans to send pulses every 5-to-8 seconds over the course of the 70-day test period.  Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Seismic testing is bad for marine life and, even worse, it will lead to oil and gas developments which is most definitely a threat to marine life and our environment from a release of too much carbon,” Dorey said. Dr Tony Worby, the chief executive of the Minderoo Foundation Flourishing Oceans initiative, said marine protected areas were vital to safeguard the health and biodiversity of the world’s oceans and that his organisation had considerable concerns about the proposed seismic survey. “Any activity that affects a marine park, including noise pollution, potentially undermines the ability of the ecosystem to function naturally and provide all its much needed benefits,” Worby said. “Minderoo strongly supports the ongoing maintenance of the marine park environments, including no-take zones, and the most stringent of risk management strategies in relation to marine protected areas.” According to the National Offshore Petroleum Titles Administrator (NOPTA), the exploration permits for these areas are held by Santos, Pathfinder Energy and 3D Oil. Public consultation on Seismic Searcher’s application closed on 15 December 2015 and should it be approved, the company will have permission to begin work as early as January 2022 – though they are not the only one. A spokesperson for Nopsema said Seismic Searcher was currently reviewing the public comments received and has yet to submit a revised plan for consideration by the regulation. “Even though the Possum 3D MSS is not planned to be conducted within an Australian marine park … Nopsema’s assessment of this EP will carefully consider the potential impacts on the values of the Mermaid Reef Australian Marine Park,” they said. Fossil fuel companies have been hoping to explore near Rowley Shoals for some time, with conservationists raising alarm in 2012 about efforts by Woodside to look for gas reserves in the region. While they were successful in stopping permits being issued, they have been re-issued in recent years. Japanese oil company Inpex has also received approval to conduct seismic testing nearby in the Kimberley Marine Park area from January in a separate application. Dorey said the federal government had shown it was capable of acting when it recently announced it will refuse an application to develop an area off the New South Wales coast for fossil fuel production known as Pep11. The International Energy Agency suggested in May that limiting global heating to 1.5C, a goal set out in the Paris agreement, meant the exploration and exploitation of new fossil fuel basins had to stop this year.",News/Australia news,"‘Reckless’ plan to search for oil and gas will put one of world’s healthiest reefs at risk, conservationists say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/24/reckless-plan-to-search-for-oil-and-gas-will-put-one-of-worlds-healthiest-reefs-at-risk-conservationists-say
12/24/2021,"Scott Morrison and the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, are both spending Christmas in Sydney but the prime minister is planning to take some leave in January, probably around the middle of the month. The final summer before a federal election would normally give party leaders a chance to recharge before a hard-fought campaign, but the country faces fresh uncertainty as a result of rapidly rising Covid case numbers and debate about bringing forward vaccine booster shots.  The prime minister would face political risks if seen to clock off during a crisis, evoking memories of his Hawaii holiday during the bushfires two years ago. Morrison, who has been crisscrossing Australia effectively in election campaign mode in recent weeks, was in Canberra on Wednesday for a previously unscheduled meeting of the national cabinet to discuss how to respond to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. Morrison is returning to Sydney to spend Christmas with his family and his mother, and is expected to remain on duty until some point in January. “The PM has publicly referred to taking some time off in the new year – when that is confirmed we will advise,” a spokesperson for the prime minister said. There was no word on whether the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, would be acting as prime minister at that point, given the arrangements are yet to be locked in. Joyce has said he will be back in Australia in time for Christmas, after isolating in a hotel in Washington DC after a positive Covid test. After Wednesday’s meeting, Morrison hinted that he was unlikely to take leave until after the next national cabinet meeting, to be held on 7 January and will consider a nationally consistent definition of close and casual contacts of Covid cases. “We will meet again in a fortnight. Obviously, we’ll continue to work through these issues as I will over the next few weeks over Christmas and into the new year, before I take a break,” Morrison told reporters. “And because we really need to get these things sorted over the next couple of weeks as we see Omicron rise.” The government has said the vaccination of children aged five to 11 is on track to begin as scheduled on 10 January. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Like Morrison, Albanese is planning to spend Christmas in Sydney with his family. But Albanese has already taken some time off: the Labor leader holidayed in the Bundaberg region of central Queensland from Friday last week until Wednesday this week. During this time, Albanese asked his deputy, Richard Marles, to serve as acting leader. Albanese cited his recent trip to Queensland during a press conference on Thursday, reflecting on the rise of daily Covid numbers to record highs in New South Wales, and stressing the need for leaders to follow the best health advice. “It is a tale of two states,” Albanese told reporters in Sydney. “In Queensland around the Bundaberg region, people were checking in with their QR codes, people were wearing masks indoors, people were checked in, every place I went into over the five days I spent in Central Queensland, they asked to see the tick on my phone to show that I’ve been vaccinated. And everyone was getting on with life as normal.” Albanese is not planning to take further holidays in the coming weeks, but has said he is planning to travel to South Australia next week. He has also said he wants to visit Western Australia as soon as it opens to domestic travellers. “Well, I’ll be there on the day that WA opens, on 5 February, I’ll be on the first flight,” Albanese told Perth radio 6PR on Thursday. “I was on the first flight to get into Queensland, to get into Brisbane. And I was on the first flight to get into Tasmania, into Launceston.” Federal parliament is scheduled to begin its first sitting of the year on 8 February, with an election due to be held by May. The budget has been brought forward to late March, setting the stage for the election campaign to begin shortly after then, but Morrison retains the option of going to the polls sooner.",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese time Christmas holidays with eye to 2022 election campaign,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/24/scott-morrison-and-anthony-albanese-time-christmas-holidays-with-eye-to-2022-election-campaign
12/24/2021,"Those England supporters who only pay attention to cricket in Australia every four years might be expecting the third Ashes Test to be a certain kind of game. That would be based on England’s last visit to the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 2017, for a match played on a pitch so dead that the biggest sporting event in Victoria’s calendar was more a state funeral. What we saw that year was a horticultural marvel, in that nobody could get anyone out, but equally nobody could score. The batting oozed along in a slurry of mistimed shots, and the chief mode of occasional dismissal seemed to be deliveries chopped onto the stumps. After days of that, the large sign above the Percy Beames bar bearing the ground’s highest score by a visiting player saw Alastair Cook’s 244 regrettably replace the masterpiece 208 by Vivian Richards. At least they both got knighthoods.  This time around, things might be different. English correspondents express bemusement that Australians use the title “curator” for those who prepare the pitch, but of course we do – it is the finest of arts. After 2017, the MCG persuaded Matt Page to move states and give up guardianship of the pitches for the two Perth grounds. In a gradual process that culminated last year, Page managed to bring the drop-in wicket square for the MCG back to life. Thus on Boxing Day in 2020, we saw a slightly green surface that was full of juice and life, giving vigour to the fast bowlers on both sides. India took the honours via Mohammed Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah, Australia bowled well via Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood, and it was a true enough wicket for Ajinkya Rahane to dig in for a series-turning century. There was also some bounce and grip for the finger-spinners on both sides, who took 11 wickets between them. It was an enthralling contest, done late on the fourth day. No curator can just roll out the same surface again, but if Page can get something approaching last year’s effort, it will be a fit stage for a contest. As deflated as the whole camp must be, England’s seam attack could yet get something useful out of such a surface and push back in the series. That won’t be of much use though without help from England’s batting, which is as likely to struggle here as anywhere. Personnel changes in the top six are likely, but if there were any potential replacements with good credentials to play, they already would be there. As to which Australian bowlers they will be facing, that is a much more open question. Josh Hazlewood will spend Christmas in Melbourne but apparently won’t play. Mitchell Starc had some back problems last time out and is facing 14 days of Test cricket out of 23. Cameron Green was held back by the fitness staff on the last day in Adelaide. Jhye Richardson put in a big shift there after not playing a Test in nearly three years. Michael Neser has had recent hamstring problems. Into the squad comes Scott Boland, seemingly as cover for everyone. Two days out from the match, Australia’s coach, Justin Langer, said that Starc would probably play and that Green’s treatment was just precaution for a young player. Cummins will return, and surely one of Neser or Richardson will be right. Boland probably won’t play but, if he does, he’s a sharp bowler who hits a hard length, and takes his wickets for Victoria at the MCG at an average of 25. Also different for this visit in 2021 will be the crowd. Facing up while surrounded by 70,000 people is still a rare experience in professional cricket, but it will be less intense than the 90,000 or more who would usually pack out Boxing Day for an Ashes tour. The Covid rate in Melbourne will keep some people at home, because for all of the MCC’s assurances about protocols, there is no way that safety standards can be maintained all day at crush points and bars. For those who do come along though, the last point of difference is a big one: the series is still live. In 2006, 2013, and 2017, the Ashes had been wrapped up 3-0 before the Boxing Day Test. With the revised schedule in 2021, it has become the third Test, which is much more compelling. A fifth Test later in January is also great for the schedule. Cricket Australia should learn and retain that for future years.

12/24/2021,"If 2020 was novel – like the virus itself – then 2021 took on a danker, darker tone. The virus and associated restrictions continued to apply a blowtorch to many aspects of our lives. The shapes that emerged from the heat were not always pretty.  “She’s not going to lock down.” “She won’t lock down.” “There’s no way she’ll lock down.” In the middle of the year, as Melbourne continued to shuffle painfully in and out of Covid restrictions, it looked like Sydney would once again avoid a major lockdown. Gladys wouldn’t do it, people said with the certainty of Moses reading a tablet. It’s just not her style. They booked restaurants and Hamilton tickets and winter holidays to Queensland. But she did do it – ultimately for 107 days. Australia’s richest city, with arguably the most libertarian bent, had to spend almost a third of the year at home. It is also Australia’s most unequal city, so some people had a better time of it than others – ie if you lived within 5km of a beach, or were not one of the LGAs of concern that had harsher lockdown measures. The future’s uncertain, the end to this thing unknown, and the lack of being able to place ourselves at a definite point in the Covid narrative has led to a hunger for the recent past. Jonathan Franzen released Crossroads, the first of a trilogy set in 1971, and part of the pleasure of reading his suburban saga of the Hildebrandt family is the absence of tech as well as huge, global meta-narratives such as coronavirus. The Vietnam war haunts the margins, but it’s in its waning days – and most of the character’s problems are reassuringly small and personal: Does he like me? Am I an OK parent? Do I look good in this coat? I hope I don’t appear foolish trying to impress these people. The three-part Beatles documentary Get Back was celebrated across the globe, not just for lost glimpses of genius in action, but as Adrian Chiles put it, a world that had yet to be degraded by the ubiquitous mobile phone and plastic packaging. “Sandwiches were brought in on actual plates and tea was drunk from actual cups,” he marvelled. And voted the best show of the year was It’s A Sin, a portrait of queer life in 1980s Britain. Over our shoulder is the nicest place to look. Meanwhile a sad nihilism has crept into the art that’s being made right now about this historic moment. In it there’s the assumption that the end is not far away. In the literary blockbuster of the year Beautiful World, Where Are You, Sally Rooney writes: “Aren’t we unfortunate babies to be born when the world ended? After that there was no chance for the planet, and no chance for us.” In Bo Burnham’s Netflix special Inside, he sings about how “The planet’s heating up. What the fuck is going on.” And in That Funny Feeling, he drops in “a quiet comprehending of the ending of it all” and “20,000 years of this, seven more to go”, referring to the amount of time we have before catastrophic climate change really bites. In Australia, novelist Emily Bitto told Guardian Australia: “I’m constantly struggling to understand the strangeness of the world right now: the hyper-capitalist, overdeveloped west, this Rome-before-the-fall moment, this onwards-rushing not looking back, this more-more-more moment.” Being tired was so hot in 2021. A democratic trend, no one was excluded. You could be young and tired, elderly and tired, working from home and tired, working in a hospital and tired. Part of the reason “tired” was a thing in 2021 was that people gave 2020 their all – and subconsciously thought somehow the virus would end when the clock struck midnight on 31 December 2020. The fact that 2021 was worse meant that already tired people suddenly entered a new, almost previously unexperienced state of fatigue. This fatigue felt like visiting a new planet, where the air was thinner, moving around felt harder, and sleep when it came, was lighter. It was the sort of tired that felt like it might take years to get over. Some of the very tired people joked that they needed a break from holiday socialising, and they got their wish! A fast-spreading new variant came along just in time for Christmas! Luckily one of the best news story of 2021 was Australia’s high vaccination rate after a slow start. A combination of everything we love. Korean content. Senseless violent deaths. Games. Tracksuits. Netflix. Author and journalist Sarah Jaffe said in a recent podcast on the great resignation: “What a lot of people realised during the pandemic is that their boss doesn’t care if they die.” The great resignation is occurring – more markedly in the US than in Australia, but still the question is being posed on a million lips: should I really be organising my whole identity around work? And if I don’t – who am I? And how do I afford stuff? Expect more existential angst in 2022. Summer 2019-20 was on fire. A billion animals died and from November until January we inhaled their charred corpses, which had been alchemised into fine particles that drifted into the cities and caused asthma. Summer 2020-21 was wet, strange, with snap border closures and Victorians recalled from their interstate holidays – or else forced to remain in Sydney. Summer 2021-22 has La Niña, cyclones, Omicron, and queuing for tests before Christmas because you don’t want to infect family members. But the last couple of winters have been mild. Maybe it’s global heating but winter at the beach over the last few years has been a lot more pleasant than summer. A trend? Not a good one. Remember when people used to post pictures in 2018 of literal haunted houses in Marrickville that were a million dollars but had rotting wallpaper and an outside toilet – and just laughed at who would actually spend a million on it? Well, that place is worth $3m and no one’s laughing now. Twitter got bad. Like – worse than usual bad. Like in June, July and August where a lot of people wanted whole cities (ie Sydney) to have a rise in case numbers and an increase in suffering and death. There is not enough space on even the most powerful phones to screenshot all the bad, mean, nasty takes. While Twitter can be a powerful spreader of information and news, its tone in 2021 took a markedly nasty turn. Time to log off or limit the Bird in 2022. But a hopeful note: Life doesn’t stop. This year I went to a wedding where the couple had spent the majority of their courtship in lockdown. They met on an app, and their first date was Zoom. Recently they got married in a socially distanced outdoor ceremony after restrictions were lifted. They are having a baby. This is great year two stuff. People will find a way. The most deadly pandemic of the 20th century, the Spanish flu, went through wave after wave and lasted for nearly four years. We have to find a way to live and love, otherwise we’ll all go insane.",Opinion/Opinion,"Farewell to 2021 … a year that was darker, stranger and even less fun than the one before | Brigid Delaney",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/24/farewell-to-2021-a-year-that-was-darker-stranger-and-even-less-fun-than-the-one-before
12/24/2021,"In the absence of restrictions that would normally accompany Covid case spikes, Australians are being left to their own devices to plan a Covid-safe Christmas. There are measures we can take to reduce the risk of transmission at Christmas gatherings and help protect yourself, your family and friends.  Here’s some tips to enjoy a Covid-safe holiday season. ’Tis the season … to cut back on socialising. Perhaps the most difficult expert advice to heed is to reduce contact with large numbers of people. It’s not something health experts advise lightly, but considering the increased transmissibility of the Omicron variant, it becomes an easy way to reduce your risk of infection. Prof Hassan Vally, an epidemiologist at Deakin University, said socialising was, unfortunately, directly linked to transmission risk. “Instead of attending 10 separate gatherings, maybe you’ll say this is the year where you should just go to two or three that are the most important ones. “There’s going to be a lot of sound judgment that’s going to be required.” It may seem mean, but maybe you shouldn’t invite your second cousin’s boyfriend’s sister to lunch this year. Health experts are advising that people should avoid large crowds over the holiday break, and that includes family members. Be ruthless with your guest list. That means reducing the number of people invited to parties, gatherings, dinners or barbecues, with many potentially acting as super-spreader events. Vally said it was a “simple relationship between the number of people you interact with and your likelihood of getting infected”. Health experts estimate that the danger of transmission rises by up to 30% as soon as someone enters an indoor area, especially one with poor ventilation. This becomes particularly relevant during Christmas, with experts advising people to avoid crowds at high-risk venues such as pubs, clubs or boats. Prof Peter Collignon, an infectious disease physician and microbiologist at the Australian National University, told the Guardian the safest Christmas gatherings were ones held outside. “I think you’d get some protection, especially for your older relatives, if you tried as much as possible to hold your gatherings outside,” he said. “The more events you’re indoors, in bars and pubs, those are the super-spreading events. The more you’re in those, the more it increases your risk.” An advantage of keeping to smaller and more intimate gatherings is that you are more likely to be able to keep a track of everyone’s vaccine status. Prof Sarah Palmer, a virologist with the Westmead Institute, emphasised the importance of creating a “vaccine bubble” at gatherings, in an effort to protect people from infection. “Is your whole family vaccinated? If not, there may be some difficult discussions to be had as to who should be getting together and who shouldn’t be.” Palmer was mindful of family gatherings being ruined by difference in vaccine status, but said it was of the utmost importance to keep track. Awkward! What to do if a guest or family member is unvaccinated and is insisting on attending a Christmas gathering? Health experts say this is where you should ask them to be socially distant and wear a mask. Blow them a kiss from across the back yard. Vally said unvaccinated people pose a risk to everyone in attendance, and it was reasonable to ask them to take extra precautions to protect others. “That may be getting them to wear a mask, be socially distant where possible, or it may be getting them to do the rapid antigen test,” Vally said. Palmer added that the booster shot was essential in keeping Christmas gatherings Covid-safe. Earlier this month, the booster schedule was changed in light of growing cases, with the gap between second dose and booster now at five months. But Palmer said people needed to be “extra careful” if they were still not due for a third dose. “The booster increases your antibody level, up to 25-fold in fact. If you’re double vaccinated, you do have some protection, but you will probably be at more risk of getting infected.” Masks are still considered essential in reducing transmission. The chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, told reporters on Wednesday that masks do work to reduce transmission. “They do protect yourself, they do protect others. The health advice is wear a mask,” Kelly said. Masks are particularly recommended in indoor settings, especially in retail settings, or in places where social distancing is impossible. Rapid antigen tests could be a convenient way to protect yourself and protect others, but only if they’re used regularly. But with reports of shortages and varying levels of dependability, they should act more as an added layer of protection, not as a replacement for other preventive measures. Vally said they’d need to be used “very judiciously” and at particular times. “Doing a rapid antigen test in the 24 hours before a gathering, or even immediately before a gathering could give everyone that extra reassurance.” Good hygiene still plays a major role in preventing infection. Victoria Health advises people to continue practising good hygiene during the Christmas break, saying it is still essential. “Cough or sneeze into your elbow. Regularly wash your hands using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser or soap and water, especially after touching surfaces, contact with others and when preparing, serving and eating food.” Finally, after a difficult and turbulent year, experts also advise everyone to try to enjoy the holidays, despite the extra precautions necessary. “I think it’s going to be really important for people to enjoy Christmas this year,” Vally said. “Just do it sensibly and responsibly.”",News/Australia news,"Mask up, reduce the guest list and sit outside: 10 tips for a Covid-safe Christmas",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/24/mask-up-reduce-the-guest-list-and-sit-outside-10-tips-for-a-covid-safe-christmas
12/24/2021,"Queensland restaurants looking forward to a bumper Christmas as tourists return are instead shutting their doors as Covid case numbers increase in the state. Some 300,000 people from Victoria, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, which have been experiencing high case numbers, travelled into Queensland after it opened its borders on 13 December.  The hospitality industry was already crippled by staff shortages caused by closed borders and a lack of migrants and backpackers. Now restaurants are being forced to close as staff found to be close contacts must quarantine for a week. Noosa has been hit hard because of the small population pool, the dominance of the tourism industry, and the influx of tourists from other states. In one venue, Sum Yung Guys, 23 staff have been deemed close contacts after another tested positive, and has closed for a week. Popular restaurant Bistro C is shut until 27 December, Paradise Arcade has closed until further notice and Theo’s Social Club has closed until 30 December. Wes Lambert, Restaurant and Catering Australia’s chief executive, said people were frustrated seeing tourists enter the state from Covid hotspots without isolating while staff had to quarantine. “The hospitality industry in Queensland was one of the hardest hit industries and continues to be so as we enter into the fourth wave with the Omicron variant,” he said. “There are inconsistencies in rules, where business owners are confused about why you can enter the state with a test within 72 hours while their staff must isolate at home for seven days even after a test. “This has led to mass [closures] … as many businesses face an even more critical staff shortage and are unable to trade.” Sum Yung Guy’s Matt Sinclair revealed on Facebook that the entire crew from a night shift had to isolate for a week, making it impossible to open during the “busiest week of the year”. “It’s not really the roadmap we saw coming out of the borders opening, the rebirth of the Queensland economy, getting businesses going again,” he said. “Losing staff because we had to enforce the mandate of them being double-vaxxed, turning away people who aren’t vaccinated, for what? I don’t know, right now, because we’ve ended up in the same place.” More than 12,000 people have signed a petition on Sum Yung Guys’ Facebook page calling for “business as usual” with no more contact tracing or restrictions. Michael Fowler, manager of Locale restaurant, said two of his staff were already isolating and another was getting tested. “We’re just being hammered with the opening of the borders,” he said. “The majority of people here are from Melbourne and Sydney, we’ve been flooded with people from there. Restaurants were hanging on until Christmas, and now they have to shut.” Indoor mask mandates were introduced for a range of Queensland venues including restaurants on Thursday as the state recorded 369 new Covid cases. Asked about the hospitality sector, the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the government was aware it was at a “critical juncture”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Which is why we are mandating masks in hospitality. This is an added measure to keep our businesses open,” she said. A government spokesperson said the quarantine period for fully vaccinated close contacts had already been reduced from 14 days to seven. Visitors did not have to isolate but close contacts did, because they had “a higher risk than other people in the community of developing Covid-19,” the spokesperson said.",News/Australia news,Covid exposures force Queensland restaurants to shut during ‘busiest week of the year’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/24/covid-exposures-force-queensland-restaurants-to-shut-during-busiest-week-of-the-year
12/24/2021,"Shegofa Hassani is leaning up against the inside of the perimeter fence, surveying the blur of moving bodies in front of her. “She’s got a mad boot on her – best kicker in the team,” she says, pointing to one of the taller girls. She is talking about Asma Mohammad Zada, an 18-year-old winger who joined when she was 13. Hassani – the captain – scans the group on the western Sydney pitch. “And she is the youngest,” she continues, redirecting her gaze towards Shafiqa Karimi, who is not yet 16. Another, named Zahra Mogul, receives her own sideline assessment as the “driven superstar” who works all-nighters as a disability support worker and then backs up for extra individual training sessions at 6am.  Mogul is one of only two Sydney United Girls squad members who were born in Australia. The rest, Hassani says with a hint of deadpan humour, are “imports” – mostly first-generation Hazaras whose families fled their native country and who will, in the coming days, contest the Afghan National Cup. Football is obviously the bread and butter of this annual five-day, round-robin tournament but the game itself is also a vessel to community, a bringing together of the diaspora, including some who have recently escaped Afghanistan. It is an excuse for families to travel interstate and renew cultural roots – and make a heap of food. It is, basically, a festival. The men’s tournament has been running since 2003 – every Christmas hopping from Queensland and Victoria to New South Wales and South Australia – but there was no female equivalent until 2015, when teams from Melbourne and Adelaide played each other in the inaugural women’s competition. The following year, Hussain Ramazani created Sydney United Girls. “I encouraged some girls to play,” says Ramazani, a Hazara man and a long-time footballer and coach who arrived by boat in 2010. “Some girls wanted to play football, but in their traditional culture they shame their family or they can’t play among their people – that’s why I encouraged them to come.” During his 20 months in Nauru detention centre, Ramazani set up mini-competitions to help distract fellow asylum seekers from their uncertain and weary circumstances. Once he got out he continued doing the same, establishing pathways for the Afghan Australian community to play football and volleyball affordably. His unofficial role now encapsulates a bit of everything: tournament organiser, team logistics manager, fundraiser, acquirer of sponsorships, mentor. In Auburn he is many things to many people. Tonight he is general overseer, perched on the touchline observing a small-sided training game. The girls, within the confines of witches hats, pass in invisible prisms at a pace clearly not quite quick enough for one of the coaches. “Yallah, yallah,” he directs, then slips into English and calls “come on, come on.” Midweek training is generally scheduled to start at 6pm but the squad, Hassani says, operate on “Afghan time”, which means the warm-up does not realistically get going until 6.30pm. The scene is relaxed, and it’s also pretty quiet at Webbs Avenue Playing Fields, save for a couple of men doing shooting practice a couple of pitches over. “It was really last-minute,” says Nilofar Sadegi a 22-year-old striker-cum-central defender who started playing football with school friends before joining Sydney United in its infancy – less than a month before the 2016 tournament. “We weren’t amazing, we just had the interest. Shegofa was captain; she was playing state league at that time. That’s where I met her actually, and now she’s my sister-in-law – soccer starts everything.” Throughout the year most of the squad play the regular football season together with local clubs. “We’ve definitely progressed over the years,” she says. “To see that grow from six people to more than a team of us ready to do the training and be committed to playing the games on Sunday and then do the tournament as well, I think that’s incredible.” Sadegi, who is almost finished a double degree in law and business and works as a clerk, arrived in Australia with immediate family when she was five. She is from the Hazara-majority Jaghori district in south-eastern Ghazni province. “I grew up here,” she says, “but I remember the mountains back home and I really, vividly remember the sunset. “My parents talk about how when they grew up it was very different in terms of it was slower, peaceful, because we were from the countryside. Whereas in Sydney it’s like full on 9-5.” She clicks her fingers. “This appointment, that appointment, you don’t know when you’re sleeping, you don’t know when you’re waking up. “My parents always try to keep my culture in me, and I’m proud of that. I love my my heritage, my food especially. I can’t cook it – I depend on my mum – but I love eating it. I love the colours, the dresses, the dances, the music. I’m very proud of my culture, but I think it does sometimes clash with the Aussie culture. I there’s a few different values at certain times.” She has been back to Pakistan, where she has some relatives, but the rest of her family are in Afghanistan, where the Taliban has returned to power and the country has plunged into a pit of mass poverty, overflowing health facilities and an economy the United Nations says is now in “freefall”. “I think it’s gotten to a point where you just kind of have to accept it,” Sadegi says. “At the end of the day, it is what it is and they can’t really do anything, and it doesn’t seem like help is coming.” Helplessness is an undeniable sentiment in this community. In Australia, though, life throws up other, less-spoken-about hardships. “There may be a misconception that people who have come here have gone through the most difficult part – for example fleeing the Talibs,” says Bahram Mia, a photographer whose family come from the eastern Laghman province, and who appears to know just about everybody. He is pitchside, on his knees and rolling film. “But in actuality,” he continues, “when you come to a new place as a migrant and you are in a completely new environment, with no family support and you’ve come with nothing, it can be even more challenging. “Especially if you’re a parent, you have those intergenerational conflicts as well, where you’re kind of pulled by your homeland but then you’re also being pulled by your kids here into a different culture and set of values. That can cause you to almost relive the trauma of leaving your homeland, because you feel as though like the sand is moving from underneath the feet of your children in terms of that cultural bedrock they had that’s no longer there. “Everybody’s journey is different. If you are from say, the intelligentsia or the more well-off and privileged and you can speak to English, you’ll probably settle a lot quicker. But that has its own challenges in that, when you were overseas you were something, and then you come here and now you’re nothing.” It is for this reason – this need to “realign perceptions” – that Mia’s mother was among a group of Afghan Australians who Zoomed some members of the women’s national team, coaches and family while they were in hotel quarantine, having been safely extracted from Kabul in August. Hassani sent them food. She doesn’t even mention this until somebody else does because it is just the normal thing to do. The 25-year-old, like Sadegi, is from Jaghori. Her father came alone by boat and subsequently sponsored her, her mother and siblings, who arrived in 2006. “I spoke very little English or little to none,” says Hassani, who now works for Creating Chances, an organisation which promotes youth development through sport in schools. “It’s very difficult … but because I was young I was able to adapt, and football really helped me in that sense because I was able to have fun and play with kids my age and learn the language through that.” She had always loved kicking the football with her brothers, but the cultural barriers around women playing seemed insurmountable. Until they weren’t, and the many initially reluctant parents came around and now whole-heartedly support their daughters. Still, there are other, more confronting challenges in Australia, such as racism. “Last year I got called a terrorist on the field by a player on an opposing team, and it hurt me,” she says. “I mean, we were terrorising them in a way because we were smashing it – I scored two or three goals – and they couldn’t play the game so they resorted to using hurtful words. We reported them to the association.” Mogul – Hassani’s “football superstar” – was born here. Her father is Afghan and her mother Armenian. The 19-year-old midfielder, who lives in Auburn with her brothers, dropped out of school not long before graduating so she could help her mum financially. She was working at Kmart then. Now she is with the NDIS, and will head straight to work after training for an overnight shift, before training again in the morning. There is method to the madness – rehabbing injuries and maintaining fitness in a bid to eventually return to playing at a higher level. In this group she is a bit of a leader. She is vocal, albeit in a few different languages. “There’s Hazaragi, Pashto, Farsi,” she says. “They all kind of sound the same but they’re not. I understand more than I can speak.” Still, the girls are a second family inside a wider second family that is the more than 12,000 Afghanistan-born Australians living in Greater Sydney. It is evident in the way a Lidcombe mosque hosted a dinner to raise funds for the tournament, in the way a local Afghan business is their front-of-shirt sponsor, and in the way Mia jokes he is told to sleep in the garage during the tournament so his household can squeeze in impromptu visitors. The Western Sydney Wanderers are also heavily involved. The A-League Men club will host the event, comprising some 600 players across 24 men’s teams, six women’s and eight youth, free of charge at their elite Blacktown training facility. It is also facilitating donors through the Wanderers Foundation. The overall emphasis is inclusion, a point particularly felt by the female players. “In our culture especially, our people place a lot of emphasis on women in education … but when it comes to sport maybe it’s not as open-minded,” Sadegi says. “It’s definitely getting better. Now we’ve got our parents seeing us on the field, and you kind of feel their pride. They get into it and they come and support you.”",Sport/Football,‘Realign perceptions’: the women behind the football at Australia’s Afghan National Cup | Emma Kemp,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/24/realign-perceptions-the-women-behind-the-football-at-australias-afghan-national-cup
12/24/2021,"Scientists and engineers have pumped 300 litres of simulated whale poo into the ocean off Sydney as part of efforts to snag a share of Elon Musk’s US$100m prize for capturing and storing carbon. The team, known as WhaleX, carried out its first open-ocean experiment on Sunday about eight kilometres off Port Botany in New South Wales after gaining clearance from the federal government.  The 12-strong team are racing to carry out a follow-up experiment using up to 2000 litres of the simulated poo – a mix of nitrogen, phosphorus and trace elements – before the end of January. Tesla and SpaceX founder Musk announced in February he was funding a US$100m competition through the XPrize Foundation to find methods that could safely capture and store carbon dioxide at a scale of a billion tonnes or more a year. Musk said at the time the competition was not “theoretical” but was looking for teams that could “build real systems that can make a measurable impact and scale to a gigaton level.” WhaleX registered for the four-year competition and will send a report before February hoping to be selected for one of up to 15 “milestone” prizes of U$1m each. Whale faeces is known as an ocean fertiliser and a food for phytoplankton. When phytoplankton grow and multiply, they absorb carbon. When they die, they sink to the ocean floor taking much of the carbon with them. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Dr Edwina Tanner, a climate scientist who is leading the WhaleX project, and colleagues said they targeted a 225sq km area off Port Botany where their previous water sampling had shown a deficiency in nutrients. From a small boat, the team aerated the formulation with a gel made from seaweed and mixed that with a dye so they could see from a drone how it dispersed. The formulation, manufactured as an aqua food by a fertiliser company in regional New South Wales, was formulated to match the deficiencies in nutrients in the area where the trial was carried out. The amount released was about the equivalent of a Humpback whale doing two poos, Tanner said. To be successful, she said the aqua food mix needs to stay in the top 20 to 30m for at least a day. “It was incredible. The food stayed buoyant and well within the trial zone location,” Tanner said. The team thinks the experiment, which was to test the method used to disperse the formulation and to see how buoyant it was, will have sequestered about two tonnes of carbon dioxide. Tanner said “a lot of science” would need to be done to make sure the approach is not damaging the marine environment, but she said as it closely mimicked a process that has been happening for millions of years “we’re confident we can do this safely.” A further trial is being planned before the end of January and will see up to 2000 litres dispersed from a larger boat in the same area of ocean. If scaled up, WhaleX would fall into a broad category of carbon reduction efforts known as negative emissions technologies – an approach where more CO2 is sequestered than is used during the process. WhaleX is looking along whale migration routes for suitable sites for further trials, including near Morocco, Oman and Kenya. An area off Western Australia over the north-west shelf has also been selected. Managing director of Ocean Nourishment Corporation (ONC) and one of the partners in the project, John Ridley, said work would continue even if it was not successful in the XPrize competition. He said the process was currently costing about $25 to $30 to sequester a tonne of carbon dioxide. He said investors were being attracted to it because of the potential scale and, he said, it could store carbon securely and for longer than some land-based methods. ONC was actively speaking with more than 10 investor groups from Europe and Australia. He said the world’s climate crisis was pushing the planet close to “several dangerous tipping points”. “We need emissions reductions and carbon removal and we have to escalate both of those really fast, almost at military scale.” This month the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a report summarising the potential risks and benefits of a range of supposed ocean-based methods to remove and store CO2. The report said there was medium to high confidence that adding nutrients to the ocean to promote phytoplankton growth could be “effective and scalable”. There was less confidence about the potential environmental risks of the method on a very large scale, but the report said “there are deep-ocean impacts and concern for undesirable geochemical and ecological consequences.” The report added: “No matter what the impact of [ocean fertilisation] on the deep sea, it should be noted that what deliberate and large-scale [ocean fertilisation] would do is essentially speed up the natural processes that are already happening, under any current scenario of enhanced CO2 in the atmosphere.” A department of agriculture, water and the environment spokesperson said it was aware of the WhaleX project and the department had confirmed the experiment could go ahead without the need for any permit. A statement said the WhaleX trials were “considered to be genuine scientific research” under the London Protocol that covers dumping at sea as it was considered a “placement” of materials. The statement said: “For future trials involving larger volumes of material, the department has advised WhaleX that additional information would be required for the department to determine whether the activity could still be defined as ‘genuine scientific research’ under the London protocol.” “If the department considers that future trials are of a scale that cannot be considered to be genuine scientific research, the activity would be considered as dumping under the sea dumping Act.” The spokesperson said the government did not have any policies on ocean fertilisation that would regulate future large scale activities. But the spokesperson also said: “However, work is under way with reference to Australia’s obligations under the London protocol to consider ocean fertilisation as a future regulatory area.” In November, teams of Australian university students at Monash University, the University of Sydney and the University of Tasmania each won a $250,000 prize in the competition for proposed carbon projects. Judges were looking for student projects that would make them “competitive applicants” in the overall competition. After four years XPrize judges will pick one U$50m grand prize winner and a U$30m prize to go be shared among up to three runners up.",News/Environment,Can fake whale poo experiment net Australian scientists a share of Elon Musk’s US$100m climate prize?,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/24/can-fake-whale-poo-experiment-net-australian-scientists-a-share-of-elon-musks-us100m-climate-prize
