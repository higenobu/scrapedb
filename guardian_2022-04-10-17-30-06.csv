4/10/2022,"Period poverty in the UK has been exacerbated by the cost of living crisis, charities warn, as the demand for menstrual products distributed by charities has increased. Data from Bloody Good Period, a charity that provides period products to those unable to buy them otherwise, found that there was a 78% increase in demand for their products during the first quarter of 2022, compared to the same period in 2020, rising from 7,452 period products to 13,284. The charity also says it expects this increase in demand to continue to rise as a greater number of people have limited disposable income as essential items, such as electricity, gas, and fuel, take up a larger proportion of their budgets. The charity has also seen a decrease in individual donations and the smaller community grants they receive due to the cost of living crisis. Emma Defoe, the operations and activism manager at Bloody Good Period, said the charity is seeing increased demand from the organisations that distribute their products, such as food banks, groups supporting refugees, and groups supporting survivors of domestic violence. These period products include sanitary towels, tampons, reusable cups and period pants. “The government committed to tacking period poverty in 2019, yet despite the issue being so much worse now due to the combined impact of the pandemic plus the current crisis, there is no meaningful commitment nor funding to provide essential period products for people who can’t afford them,” Defoe says. “Instead, small charities like Bloody Good Period fill the gap.” Abibat Olulode, who works for Feed for Read, a charity affiliated with Lambeth council that supports about 20 families with no recourse to public funds during school holidays, says that since 2021 the charity has also been distributing period products, provided by Bloody Good Period, to these families. People with no recourse to public funds, primarily asylum seekers, receive a weekly allowance of just under £40, and with period products costing on average £13 a month, many cannot afford them. “They simply can’t afford period products,” Olulode said. “They’re struggling to pay for a fairly expensive item. We’re acutely aware of all the problems with reports of children staying off school because of their period.” “Some families couldn’t even afford the bus fair to come and pick up products from us,” Olulode adds. “If they can’t even afford that, paying for a period is going to be a problem.” Judith Shalkowski, a coordinator at Meeting Point, a charity based in Leeds, has also seen an increase in the demand for period products due to the cost of living crisis. “We are seeing more and more people who bring with them friends in similar situations to themselves, but who have not registered with us. Someone will come in with a friend or a neighbour, who is also an asylum seeker or refugee, and they’ll show them what support they can receive.” Meeting Point acts as both a community hub for refugees and asylum seekers, providing English classes and activity groups as well as hot meals and essential hygiene at a weekly drop in. Since 2017, it has also been distributing period products. “The people coming to us are always surprised that they can have free period products,” Shalkowski says. “One woman who receives period products from us said that after she came to collect pads, she was surprised to see well-known brands on offer that she would never be able to afford otherwise. She said that in the past she would never buy a liner, and so would stay indoors whenever she had her period because she couldn’t afford to buy anything.” “People tell us that supplying period products takes the stress away so that they can try to deal with other issues, such as their energy bills.”",News/Society,"Cost of living crisis has exacerbated period poverty, charities say",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/10/cost-of-living-crisis-has-exacerbated-period-poverty-charities-say
4/10/2022,"Creatives in Ukraine are trying to harness consumer power in an attempt to keep the country’s economy going amid the Russian invasion. Before the war began in February, Ukraine was known as a hotbed of creativity in fashion, art and design. Now its designers and artists are launching initiatives to support creatives with various websites that support Ukrainian brands. Earlier this month Angel for Fashion launched – a website with more than 30 Ukrainian fashion brands, ranging from the frills of Paskal to the modern tailoring of Elena Burenina. It was set up by Jen Sidary, a former Vivienne Westwood staffer who spent the pandemic in Kyiv, and the Ukrainian designer Alina Kachorovska. In a press release Sidary said Angel for Fashion “was created to mobilise the global fashion community and ensure Ukrainian fashion continues to thrive”. She added: “You are supporting these companies with your purchase as the money goes directly to the brand.” This follows other online resources, including Spend With Ukraine, which links to Ukraine-based businesses across everything from digital fashion to blankets and electric bikes, and the Ukrainian Emergency Art Fund, which allows people to donate three-month stipends to support artists. Bettter Community, set up by the former Vogue Ukraine fashion director Julie Pelipas, is a platform for those in the industry to hire photographers, stylists, makeup artists and others based in the country. Spend With Ukraine’s founders, Yaroslav Azhnyuk and Andrey Klen, are clear about the power that comes from buying Ukrainian. “Armies win battles, but economy wins wars,” says Klen. “Product teams in Ukraine keep working while being shelled, displaced, and pressured … Backing Ukrainian-made businesses equals supporting the economy which nears our victory.” Klen says the simplicity of the idea is essential. “Global media and influencers are taking notice because the whole thing is very reasonable and logical – it’s quite easy to support Ukraine with your purchase decisions.” The fashion designer Anna October makes 90s-style slip dresses and knitwear and is featured on Spend With Ukraine. She agrees with Klen. “Almost all [Ukrainian brands] are operating now, so when buying a dress for the date, you can support the brand teams and Ukraine,” she says. “Every brand is donating to different needs to support the country.” For each Anna October sale, 30% is donated to the Children’s Emergency Fund. These initiatives are primarily about helping Ukrainian creatives in a way that supports existing industries, and even provides some semblance of normality. “Product demand allows businesses to stay afloat and contributes to a very important financial balance,” says Klen. “Life goes on – investments definitely help with that.” After leaving Vogue, Pelipas was in the midst of setting up an upcycling business – then the war began. She pivoted her website to become a platform for young creatives in Ukraine. This was partly prompted by her experience travelling to Paris early on in the war: “It was a very, very dramatic day for me because I witnessed this contrast between my worlds in Ukraine and, you know, the beautiful world of fashion.” Bettter Community came about as a response to her international colleagues asking how they could help. “This will make it easy to help these kids on all levels,” says Pelipas. “If they will feel that they have a job, they have a chance for their future.” Klen says sustaining interest in spending with Ukraine is key. “We are seeing some indications of increased demand and frankly we want it to blow out. That’s why getting the word out is so important. This programme is working and we’ll take any help [we can get] to scale it.”",News/World news,‘Economy wins wars’: Ukraine creatives hope to harness consumer power,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/10/economy-wins-wars-the-projects-helping-shoppers-to-support-ukraine
4/10/2022,"This election can’t be about Scott Morrison, because if it is, there’s a very good chance the Coalition loses. To put it bluntly, Morrison has an “I’m the problem” problem. So the prime minister swerved around this central difficulty for the Coalition campaign on Sunday by declaring the political contest he’d just opened was about you, the voters, and the risks of an unproven alternative. Distilled to the essence, the coming election was “a choice between a government you know and a Labor opposition you don’t”. Interestingly, Morrison didn’t name Anthony Albanese once in Sunday’s opening sortie. The doer of all the unspeakably scary things that would happen if the Coalition loses on 21 May was the “Labor opposition” – a description that conveys two negatives economically to distracted voters. One: Labor is not currently in government. Two: the word “opposition” sounds negative and carping. Morrison dragged the Labor brand and totally blanked his opponent. This suggests that at the opening of the 2022 electoral battle, Albanese is not considered a negative by voters. To understand this point, we need only compare Sunday’s pitch with the one Morrison unfurled three years ago. Back in 2019, Morrison bowled up almost identical formulations about elections being about choices, and about the Coalition being the party of lower taxes and proven economic management. But last time he namechecked his opponent. The 2019 election, Morrison said, was “a choice between a government that I lead and the alternative of a Labor government led by Bill Shorten. You will have the choice between a government that is delivering a strong economy and will continue to do so, or Bill Shorten’s Labor party, whose policies would weaken our economy.” Morrison’s opening pitch this time was one of the shortest I’ve ever seen for a federal election campaign – very simple messages, and not a word wasted. Having judged that he’d landed his lines, the prime minister entertained only six questions before retreating to his office, prompting laughter from the assembled press pack about the hasty retreat (in the spirit of laughing at, rather than with). The prime minister is clearly opening this fight for his political life – and that’s what he’s now in – exactly as he means to continue. If Morrison has his way, the next six weeks will not be a freewheeling dialogue, a group hug or a fireside chat. What’s coming between now and 21 May is core Morrison, or at least core political Morrison: brutal, transactional and on-task. The prime minister intends to rise before dawn, appear at his staged events, landing the messages he wants to land. Then he’ll vamoose before anything gets even remotely sticky. The sum of these parts tells us Morrison and the Coalition are not starting this contest from a position of political strength. Morrison’s charm bank, such as it was, is empty. The devil you know is what the prime minister has, and what he intends to use. The length of the coming campaign, six weeks instead of five, also tells you Morrison’s chief hope is to first pin his elusive opponent, Albanese – the one he’s been struggling to get a glove on – and then grind the Labor leader down with his buzzing relentlessness. There’s a mantra in the government, or perhaps a prayer or an invocation: Morrison is a better campaigner. Well, that mantra is about to be tested. For his part, Albanese fronted the voters in the commonwealth parliamentary offices in Sydney. On television, that location read as flat and workaday, but presumably the campaign thought the setting looked putatively prime ministerial. Albanese’s pitch is safe change in an environment where change might feel scary. He told voters Australia was a great country, but could be “better with a better government”. He said the incumbents had a plan for re-election, a plan to grab a second decade in office, but no plan for the future. The Labor leader tipped his hat to the grinding relentlessness of the six weeks to come. Fear, he told the voters, can be a “powerful emotion, and I imagine there will be quite a bit over the next few weeks”. “But I want to appeal to your sense of optimism and desire for a better future, one where there is more work and better-paying jobs, stronger Medicare, cheaper childcare, and a future made here, revitalising Australian manufacturing.” Apart from what country he might build if given the opportunity, Albanese offered the following on who he is. The core pitch was: I am decent. I will respect an office that my opponents have disdained and traduced. Labor is ready to govern. I’ve been campaigning since I was a kid. I’ve been deputy prime minister, acting prime minister and chief parliamentary tactician for Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. If you put us back in government, I will lead the “most experienced incoming Labor government in history”. It’s true, Albanese was the glue in the Rudd/Gillard period, the roving diplomat shuttling between the divorcing parents and the crossbench required to maintain Labor’s grip on power. Albanese works from the inside out. He doesn’t overpromise and he doesn’t sizzle. He’s had the glow-up, but he’s not used to styling himself as the political frontman with the X factor, and it’s not clear he could be trussed that way, even if that’s what this moment ultimately requires. If Morrison is the devil Australians know, safety is Albanese’s campaign pitch, with a measure of political qualities perhaps thought to be extinct: hope and humility.",News/Australia news,"Settle in for a long grind: this federal election is going to be core, brutal Morrison | Katharine Murphy",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/10/settle-in-for-a-long-grind-election-is-going-to-be-core-brutal-scott-morrison
4/10/2022,"No war crimes case is easy, but the task of indicting Vladimir Putin at the International Criminal Court (ICC) appears to be straightforward. There are two key elements necessary to charge a commander-in-chief with war crimes. First are the crimes themselves. Second, the chain-of-command to the top. In the case of Russia’s Ukraine invasion, both seem clear. The horrors of Bucha and a slew of towns north of Kyiv are gruesome and widespread. They are also, crucially, being recorded in real time. A major problem for war crimes trials in the past was that evidence had to be sifted from chaotic battlefields years after the fact. This is not the case here. Ukraine’s own investigators are already on the ground, alongside specialists from The Hague. Last month the ICC opened an online evidence portal, inviting ordinary Ukrainians to become part of the investigation process. Russia is not a member of the ICC, but Ukraine has given the court jurisdiction for crimes on its territory, no matter who commits them. The first stage of an indictment is to match evidence of atrocities to records showing which units committed them. For this, video of shattered Russian tanks and abandoned camps will be scrutinised to see which formations were at the scene of the crime. Tiny details can be important, such as graffiti left by a retreating unit, information from abandoned laptops or regimental flashes on discarded uniforms. Nato can play a role here by giving access to intelligence it has collected. Last week Germany’s security service, the BND, released chilling intercepts to its parliament. They included a blunt instruction from one Russian commander: “First question the soldiers, then shoot them.” Spy planes and satellites have kept track of Russia’s order of battle, some of it gleaned from Russians themselves. As the BND has found, many Russian headquarters give orders in the clear. The United States is not an ICC member, but Congress has passed a bipartisan resolution calling for cooperation with the court, which should release an avalanche of information. War crimes evidence works like a mosaic. Prosecutors combine forensics with witness accounts, video and intelligence to produce a complete picture of the crimes and who committed them. When prosecutors have established a pattern of atrocities, the next step is moving up the command chain. Normally this is difficult. The two most high-profile war crimes trials of recent years, against Serbia’s Slobodan Milošević and Liberia’s Charles Taylor, had problems linking these leaders to ragtag militias operating in distant forests and mountains. By contrast, Russia’s chain of command needs no investigation because it is a matter of public record. Its military regulations set out the responsibilities of its generals, while Article 87 of the constitution names the president as supreme commander of the armed forces. War law gives no immunity to presidents, as Milošević and Taylor found out. Nor is responsibility diluted the further up the command chain you go. If anything, the supreme commander is the most responsible, because he has the most power. The ICC can charge Russia’s high command with war crimes and crimes against humanity without having to prove they ordered these crimes. It is enough to show that crimes happened and commanders did nothing to prevent them, or punish those responsible. Prosecutors are likely to argue that, with its continuing bombardment of Mariupol, Russia has shown no interest in preventing or punishing even the worst atrocities. In the past the ICC has started investigations at the top, rather than first charging lower-level commanders. When it began investigating atrocities in Libya’s Arab spring revolution a decade ago, the country’s leader Muammar Gaddafi was on the very first indictment. Less clear is whether anyone will be charged with genocide. Rightly called the crime of crimes, genocide requires evidence of intent, which is a procedural labyrinth prosecutors may for now avoid. More complicated still is bringing a charge of the crime of aggression. The charge is arguably the easiest to prove, because it refers to any war, such as Russia’s Ukraine invasion, launched in violation of the UN Charter. However, the ICC is not part of the UN. And for this particular charge, ICC rules dictate it cannot indict those from non-member states like Russia. Available evidence suggests that, as with Gaddafi, ICC prosecutors could bring charges against Russia’s top brass in a matter of months. Yet it is possible nobody will ever be brought to trial. The ICC has no police force or ready means to get suspects to The Hague. Western powers could tie existing sanctions to Russia handing over indictees, but that is an uncertain path. For now, investigators labouring amid the mud and blood of Bucha do so despite knowing that justice may never be done.Chris Stephen is the author of Judgement Day: The Trial of Slobodan Milošević (Atlantic Books, 2004)",News/Law,Witnessing atrocities in real time in Ukraine is changing everything,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/apr/10/witnessing-atrocities-in-real-time-in-ukraine-is-changing-everything
4/10/2022,"Last week I had a big professional meeting, not about chocolate, yet most of it was taken up talking about chocolate. I can’t think of another food stuff that can so bind people together. Maybe cheese, or chips, but chocolate talks to the child in all of us. One of the questions I was asked was, ‘Where can I get a dark chocolate egg that has lots of nuts in?’ At Easter, I rarely go dark chocolate (although, see later), it has to be milk for me, but Venchi does some really good offerings of dark eggs so pebble-dashed with hazelnuts, from £13/70g, they are strangely, pox-like-fascinating. (For an egg with bits in, in general, nothing beats a Gabriella Cugno egg, but they sold out two weeks ago, 48 hours after launch). Talking of ‘none betters’, I’ve spent a year trying to find better mini eggs than Chantal Coady’s Chocolate Detective Bird’s Eggs, £12.75. And I haven’t succeeded – the ones to go for are the chaffinch eggs, pink and plenty full of praline. Bare Bones launched its first ever Easter egg this year, £22, a stupendous offering, in 60% Honduran milk chocolate, I am glad to say. Luisa’s Vegan Chocolates has some wonderful flat bunnies, called Luigi, from £9.50, in dark chocolate or Casholate (cashew nuts therein) in ‘milk’ or white. But my absolute favourite here was the ‘flat’ 75% Solomon Islands chocolate egg with Sicilian orange peel, £9.70. So good I ate it all in one sitting.

The result crackles with a wired energy that doubles down on his core creative tenets, while still sounding like no other White record released previously. The colourful, Nashville-based impresario has always favoured discrete sounds as penetrating as dental drills.

At the same time, a half-light suffuses this album in which anything goes, dodging the logic of the day. Songs called Into the Twilight (whistles, burbles, funk, piano) and Morning, Noon and Night (in which White begs for “a little more time” with a lover) underline the liminal theme, while Eosophobia (Greek for fear of the dawn) uses dub techniques, echo, stereo pans and analogue squealing to ward off the inevitability of morning. “No you don’t!” chants White, as though trying to command the sun.",Arts/Music,Jack White: Fear of the Dawn review – crackles with energy,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/10/jack-white-fear-of-the-dawn-review
4/10/2022,"Thousands of borrowers took out mortgages lasting 35 years or more during the government’s stamp duty holiday in an attempt to keep up with rising prices. There was a surge in borrowing across the board, and figures show that despite record low interest rates, the number of people taking “marathon mortgages” also increased. As the first phase of the stamp duty holiday drew to a close in England, 35,046 mortgages with a term of 35 years or more were sold in June 2021. In September, as the second phase came to an end, another 28,112 were sold. The figures, obtained by wealth management firm Quilter under the Freedom of Information Act from the Financial Conduct Authority, showed a huge jump in the June figures, although that was from a period just after lockdown restrictions on the housing market were eased. The September figures showed a 75% year-on-year increase in long-term home loans. Quilter says this suggests borrowers were taking the opportunity during the stamp duty holiday to buy larger and more expensive homes, stretching repayments over a longer term in order to make them affordable. The £3.8bn stamp duty holiday was announced by chancellor Rishi Sunak in July 2020 to ward off a collapse in the housing market during the first Covid lockdown. Until the end of June 2021, the first £500,000 spent on a property in England and Northern Ireland was tax free, which meant a saving of up to £15,000. Scotland and Wales had different stamp duty holidays which ended in June 2021. In England, the tax break was scaled down, with the threshold at which the tax on property purchases begins falling to £250,000 to the end of September 2021. The so-called “nil rate band” returned to its pre-pandemic level of £125,000 on 1 October. Charlotte Nixon, from Quilter, says people who take out the longer-term mortgages will pay more interest in order to spread the loan. She says: “Those who purchased for the average house price in June and September 2021, saved £3,283 and £2,499 on stamp duty respectively. But to take advantage of this saving, many had to opt for a longer term to ensure it was affordable.” “However, had they held off until they could afford a standard length mortgage, they could well have saved themselves a lot more money in the long run than just the stamp duty savings.” The policy has been described as a “reckless move” by Generation Rent, a lobby group for private renters. Deputy director Dan Wilson Craw says: “Not only did it hand billions of pounds to the already wealthy through higher house prices, but thousands of households have exposed themselves to huge risk by taking out mortgages they could still be paying off in retirement, in order to compete with other buyers.” The Quilter figures show there were increases of more than 300% in mortgages taken out across the board, from 20- 25-year terms up to 35-40-year terms. Nixon says the additional cost of taking on a longer-term mortgage may have been an “afterthought” for those rushing to meet the stamp duty deadlines.",Lifestyle/Money,Stamp duty holiday tempted buyers into ‘marathon’ loans,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/10/stamp-duty-holiday-tempted-buyers-into-marathon-loans
4/10/2022,"Immediately after Russia invaded Ukraine the BBC recognised that something extra meaningful would be required from its daily religious slot, Thought for the Day. No offence to its regular Thinkers, the meek being blessed and so forth, but this was a moment for TFTD’s random Buddhists, novelist-preachers and the man from the Iona community to step aside while one of the world’s star prelates showed how a secular audience can still benefit from organised religion. Radio 4’s Today programme – cursed to feature this slot for eternity – duly introduced the archbishop of Canterbury’s thought as a “special” one. “To wake up to the news of war is terrible” was the celebrity’s rousing start – well, rousing if you know that a non-special TFTD generally goes for an introductory anecdote, where no interesting religious festival is available, about reading a gas meter or watching telly. The Adam Kay drama, for instance, got canon Angela Tilby, TFTD’s answer to Tammy Faye, wondering if hospitals shouldn’t be less hierarchical and thus “more in tune with the Christian roots of the NHS”. Another regular began: “Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine I came down with Covid, which is this dreadful year in a nutshell.” But Justin Welby, in training for this all his life, knew a bard moment (“Shakespeare refers to war as chaos”) should preface the diagnostic this-is-how-we-are-feeling section of his address: “We are thinking, where is it going to go next?” A quote from Jesus – “in the world you will have trouble, but do not be afraid” – and we were soon cantering towards the classic TFTD conclusion: that there are no answers to all the awfully big questions beyond the speaker’s declaration of faith. Welby’s audience could forget Ukraine and dwell, by way of respite, on him. “For me and for many of faith, the great certainty in the world, the only certainty, is that we know that God does not change.” At times like this, we ask: how can such stuff still be broadcast to the educated audience of a news programme? There are no easy answers. Nor, despite decades of protests against TFTD’s platitudes, is any end in sight. But having listened to most of the offerings since the Russian invasion I do know we should give thanks: the archbishop’s wartime contribution could so easily have been worse. His message was not, in contrast to some fellow contributors’, spectacularly silly, deranged or offensive. That might not sound much of an achievement, but one junior thinker, a mask-hating Telegraph journalist anointed by the BBC, would later volunteer this insight: “Ukraine has touched the west in the way that Syria or Yemen did not – and one of the reasons is that, being a European country, it looks so familiar.” Well, as a fellow TFTD sage tells us, “we are all sinners”. Are the contributions, you sometimes wonder, even edited? Not just for taste and decency, but for weirdness, for repetition. Within the last month, we’ve heard twice about doubting Thomas, ditto the story about Abraham hosting the angels, along with ritual reminders, for any listeners unaware, that rape is bad, time precious and war, though dreadful, not new. “Although dating back several thousand years, the context in which Hinduism’s Bhagavad Gita was first spoken is strikingly similar.” Along with various Ukraine-refreshed bromides, the audience has been invited to consider deep suffering as a learning opportunity and to enjoy music that teaches everybody, not excluding dispossessed refugees, to look on the bright side. Oddly enough, the occasional confession of utter defeat can come across better. “Buddhism has no magical answer to events like the Russian invasion of Ukraine.” We can only hope, anyway, that no survivors of Bucha heard the offering by Brian Draper (“associate lecturer at London’s Institute of Contemporary Christianity”), delivered when there was still some of Bucha left to be shelled: “A friend told me recently how she’s listening to Rachmaninov’s Vespers to identify with the spiritual sorrow of Russia.” Music, Draper said, “carries us beyond words and hopefully beyond division too”. And maybe there really is some tune out there, since words have yet to enlighten Russia’s patriarch Kirill that could carry his and other faith communities beyond their divisions. Isn’t it time someone told Kirill, as bishop Nick Baines recently told us, that “hope has a melody and life has a rhythm that makes us dance”? But post-invasion TFTDs have yet, perhaps understandably, to mention the elephant in the pulpit. Even with their vast experience separating palatable religion from the horrible bits, any Thinkers who publicly speculate on how another religious leader can be so obscenely wrong risk reminding listeners that their own authority derives, give or take some job titles, from the same source. Kirill’s even done his Thoughts for Each Day of the Year. Was it a good idea for Welby to invite this monster round in 2016? It would look more like a well-meaning mistake if Kirill hadn’t previously denounced feminism as a threat to the motherland, adding that it was “no accident” that most feminist leaders were unmarried. Still, what’s the subjugation of half of humanity when impressive faith alliances are at stake? Meeting at Lambeth Palace, it was recorded, the Anglican and the future genocide sympathiser “agreed that the first loyalty of the Christian church is to the Lord Jesus Christ, and they affirmed that reconciliation was the key ministry of the Church in situations of conflict”. In a similar spirit, with the Rev Lucy Winkett teaching listeners that “reconciliation is the core of Christian living”, it might be harsh to hold an occasional tolerance for rabid misogyny against archbishop Justin. That said, until faith leaders can demonstrate the art of reconciling themselves, there’s a good case, if it can’t be axed, for the BBC’s inverting the cast and audience of TFTD. Wait until the clerics hear about that time an archbishop thought he was hosting a harmless old patriarch.

4/10/2022,"The attorney general, Merrick Garland, is facing more political pressure to move faster and expand the US Department of Justice’s investigation into the January 6 Capitol attack and charge Donald Trump and some of his former top aides. With mounting evidence from the January 6 House panel, court rulings and news reports that Trump engaged in a criminal conspiracy in his aggressive drive to thwart Joe Biden’s election win in 2020, Garland and his staff face an almost unique decision: whether to charge a former US president. Ex-justice officials caution, however, that while there’s growing evidence of criminal conduct by Trump to obstruct Congress from certifying Biden’s win on January 6 and defraud the government, building a strong case to prove Trump’s corrupt intent – a necessary element to convict him – probably requires more evidence and time. In an important speech in January this year, Garland said he would hold “all January 6 perpetrators, at any level” accountable, if they were present at the Capitol that day or not, who were responsible for this “assault on our democracy”, which suggested to some ex-prosecutors that Trump and some allies were in his sights. But rising pressures on Garland to move faster with a clearer focus on Trump and his top allies have come from Democrats on the House panel investigating the Capitol attack. Those concerns were underscored this past week when the House sent a criminal referral to the justice department charging contempt of Congress by two Trump aides, trade adviser Peter Navarro and communications chief Dan Scavino, who refused to cooperate after being subpoenaed. “We are upholding our responsibility, the Department of Justice must do the same,” panel member Adam Schiff said. Likewise, Congresswoman Elaine Luria urged Garland to “do your job so we can do ours.” About four months ago, the House sent a criminal contempt of Congress referral to the justice department for the former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, but so far he has not been indicted. Some former top DoJ officials and prosecutors, however, say Garland is moving correctly and expeditiously in pursuing all criminal conduct to overturn Biden’s election in its sprawling January 6 inquiry. “When people (including many lawyers) criticize the DoJ for not more clearly centering the January 6 investigation on Trump, they are expressing impatience rather than a clear understanding of the trajectory of the investigation,” the former justice inspector general Michael Bromwich told the Guardian. “DoJ is methodically building the case from the bottom up. It is almost surely the most complex criminal investigation in the nation’s history, involving the most prosecutors, the most investigators, the most digital evidence – and the most defendants,” he added. Bromwich added that “people view the scores of ongoing criminal prosecutions of participants in the January 6 insurrection as somehow separate from the investigation of Trump. They are not. He is the subject of the investigation at the top of the pyramid. People need to carefully watch what is happening, not react based on their impatience.” The department’s investigation is the biggest one ever. More than 750 people have been charged so far with federal crimes, and about 250 have pleaded guilty. Still, concerns about the pace of the investigation – and why charges have not been filed against Trump – have been spurred in part by a few revelations over the last couple of months. Last month, for instance, federal judge David Carter in a crucial court ruling involving a central Trump legal adviser, John Eastman, stated that Trump “more likely than not” broke the law in his weeks-long drive to stop Biden from taking office. “Dr Eastman and President Trump launched a campaign to overturn a democratic election, an action unprecedented in American history,” Carter wrote in a civil case which resulted in an order for Eastman to release more than 100 emails he had withheld from the House panel. Similarly, the January 6 select committee made a 61-page court filing on 2 March that implicated Trump in a “criminal conspiracy” to block Congress from certifying Biden’s win. On another legal front that could implicate Trump and some top allies, the deputy attorney general, Lisa Monaco, revealed in January that the DoJ was starting a criminal investigation into a sprawling scheme – reportedly spearheaded by Trump’s ex-lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Trump campaign aides – to replace legitimate electors for Biden with false ones pledged to Trump in seven states that Biden won. Further, the Washington Post reported late last month that the DoJ had begun looking into the funding and organizing of the January 6 “Save America” rally in Washington involving some Trump allies. Trump repeated his false claims at the rally that the election was stolen. “We won this election, and we won it by a landslide,” Trump falsely told the cheering crowd. “You don’t concede, when there’s theft involved,” he said, urging the large crowd to “fight like hell”, shortly before the Capitol attack by hundreds of his supporters that led to 140 injured police and several deaths. A Trump spokesperson, Taylor Budowich, has called the House January 6 inquiry a “circus of partisanship”. And Budowich attacked Judge Carter’s ruling as “absurd and baseless”, noting that Carter was a “Clinton-appointed judge in California”. Dennis Aftergut, a former federal prosecutor, told the Guardian that recent actions by the House January 6 panel and by the DoJ, along with court opinions, have notably increased legal threats to Trump. “Anyone would need ice in their veins not to feel the heat when all three branches of the federal government are breathing down your neck,” he said. On the issue of whether Trump may be indicted, Donald Ayer, who served as deputy attorney general in the George HW Bush administration, said “the critical question should be whether there is adequate proof of wrongful intent.” Citing Carter’s ruling that Trump “more likely than not” broke the law, Ayer said that “the evidence of such intent has recently become a lot stronger.” Nonetheless, Ayer and Aftergut stress Garland has to juggle competing priorities lest he politicize his department, while being extra careful to ensure any charges he may bring against Trump will stand up in court. “Garland’s between the rock of defending one justice department ideal and the hard place of protecting another. On one hand, no person is above the law. On the other hand, the department needs to avoid, as much as possible consistent with the first ideal, appearing political,” Aftergut said. “There’s nothing easy about the position Garland’s in,” Aftergut added. “The safest course, before considering a prosecution of a former president, would be to demand considerably more evidence of guilt than you’d require in any other case.” Ayer added: “Garland is right not to be discussing the specifics of whether and how Trump may be indicted,” a stance Garland has adopted to protect the DoJ’s credibility as not political. At the same time, Ayer suggested that Garland “should spend more time talking to the country about impartial justice and the idea that no person is above the law”. There are clear risks in moving too fast to appease critics. “Garland must make his decisions based on the law in relation to the facts,” the former federal prosecutor Michael Zeldin said. “The more politicians endeavor to pressure Garland to act, it runs the risk that any decision Garland makes will be seen as politically motivated rather than based on purely legal considerations.” That seems to fit with Garland’s approach. In his 5 January speech this year, Garland emphasized, “we follow the physical evidence. We follow the digital evidence. We follow the money. But most important, we follow the facts – not an agenda or an assumption. The facts tell us where to go next.” And, if there is enough evidence, following the rules could end up with Trump getting charged. “DoJ will never announce that it is investigating Trump and his inner circle. Such an announcement would violate DoJ policy to neither confirm nor deny the existence of an investigation,” said Barbara McQuade, a professor from practice at the University of Michigan Law School and a former attorney for the eastern district in Michigan. Garland, McQuade added, “is avoiding the mistake FBI director Jim Comey made in investigating Hillary Clinton, for which Comey was properly criticized”, referring to two status reports about the investigation made in the months before the 2016 election. Ultimately, McQuade said that Garland’s “biggest challenge will be proving that Trump had corrupt intent or intent to defraud, both of which would require proving that he knew his fraud claims were false. It can be very difficult to prove what was in someone’s mind, but it is not impossible.”",News/US news,Is Trump in his sights?

4/10/2022,"Meera Syal is arguably the nation’s favourite British-Asian TV comedian. She’s definitely the Queen’s. A few weeks ago, former Radio 2 editor, Phil Jones, revealed that, when introduced to the Queen in 2001, she told him her favourite show was The Kumars at No 42. According to Jones, she even quoted lines from Syal’s grandma character. Syal laughs when I mention this: “If it’s true – fantastic. I can see why she’d respond to a very smart older woman with agency.” We meet at a London photo studio. Maybe I also have Granny Kumar lodged in my brain because Syal, 60, is slighter, more delicate, than I expect. She is also engaged and easy company, tucking into a veggie burger as we chat. There’s certainly plenty to talk about when it comes to Syal’s decades-spanning career. The groundbreaking British-Asian television comedies – Goodness Gracious Me and The Kumars – are just the tip of it. There’s her extensive work across film, television and theatre, ranging from the RSC to the West End. There are also books, scripts, screenplays, including the adaptation of her debut (semi-autobiographical) novel, Anita and Me. Her awards include an MBE in 1997 and a CBE in 2015. Is Syal as driven as it appears? When it comes to work, you sense an effervescent restlessness, like a tablet permanently fizzing in a glass of water. “A work ethic is a terrible thing,” she says. “I’m not very good at doing nothing. I’m getting… better.” She feels her mindset has shifted with time. In 2005, she married her GGM/Kumars collaborator, Sanjeev Bhaskar (who also played Sunny in ITV’s Unforgotten) in what could be a romcom plot – they got together after years of being friends. She has a daughter from her first marriage, and she and Bhaskar have a son. Her mother lives with them in north London, as did her late father. “When you’re young and hungry, it really is…” Syal pulls a “grrr” face. “Ambition has a sharp taste, you’re out there. Now it’s more about job satisfaction, work-life balance. What’s the script like? Who am I working with? Will I learn anything?” Her new project is Roar, an Apple TV+ anthology series based on the short story collection by Cecelia Ahern. Involving, among others, Alison Brie, Cynthia Erivo and Issa Rae, they are playfully dark, uber-feminine stories suffused with magical realism: women find their bodies disappearing; or they are placed on shelves; or they have disturbing relationships with ducks. Nicole Kidman – also co-executive producer – appears in one episode playing a woman who eats photographs. Syal stars in The Woman Who Returned Her Husband, a blackly comedic parable (teleplay by Vera Santamaria) about midlife marital ennui. She plays a frustrated housewife who – literally – returns her husband to a shop. It’s a strong, fluid performance: Syal has to first sag like a frump, then convince as a woman taking action. “It’s about two people who’ve forgotten who each other are, and regard each other as invisible,” says Syal. Her character reminds her of playing Shirley Valentine at the Menier Chocolate Factory in 2010. “The life unlived; that feeling of – two-thirds of my life gone, and what have I done with it?” She shudders. “Ah god – unfulfilled potential really gets me.” Syal’s parents were originally from New Delhi and she grew up in the Midlands, first in a mining area in Staffordshire, then Bloxwich, north Walsall: “We were the only Asians in the village, to coin a phrase.” The family encountered prejudice from outsiders, but not their neighbours: “We were all at the bottom of the social pile together, that’s the thing.” She was surrounded by people – her father, who spent part of his youth as a refugee; Indian “aunties” – who had to sideline their creative impulses. “That’s the immigration journey: artistic skills don’t travel, nobody wants them.” Did that scare her, push her harder? “It totally did. I didn’t want to ever feel like I hadn’t tried. If you try and it doesn’t work out, at least you’ve got the knowledge that you did try.” Education was her “passport” out, initially to Manchester University to study English and drama, and she worries about young working-class people now. “How would a kid like me have got in without a grant system, and free education?” Once she was working, she didn’t suffer a lot of sexual harassment in the industry – “I was just lucky” – but there were casting couch incidents early on. “One director barefacedly said, ‘I’ll give you the part if you sleep with me’, and it was Aladdin in a panto. It was, like, jeez, if I’m going to do that, I’m not going to do it for fucking Aladdin! Offer me something better.” She didn’t mean it, of course. “I laughed heartily, then he laughed heartily, as if it was a joke, but it wasn’t.” Syal shakes her head wearily: “The gall of it, it’s astonishing. Never underestimate the confidence of a mediocre white man.” Goodness Gracious Me and The Kumars at No 42 were interesting in purely television terms; as vehicles for long-neglected Indian talent, they were revolutionary. “It was unique because it was very specifically British-Asian humour, and that was new,” says Syal. They represented their community? “It’s a tricky one, this – when there’s so few of you, everything becomes representative, that’s the problem.” Growing up caught between two cultures, Syal was never surprised that so many of her generation were creative. “We had to be. We were shapeshifters… it made us adept at being inventive.” Do young people now view her as an inspiration? “Yes, sometimes, and that’s lovely. I know how few role models there were for me and how important it is.” In her view: “It’s a golden age of television.” She is delighted to see new comedies such as Channel 4’s We Are Lady Parts, about a Muslim punk band, and she is cautiously optimistic that things are improving for actors of colour. “The streamers kicked everybody up the arse – they’re looking at global audiences not parochial ones.” In Syal’s day, she was driven to write scripts by the lack of roles. “It was, ‘Victim of arranged marriage’, and, as you got older, ‘Mother of victim of arranged marriage’, and you just go, there’s got to be more than this, surely?” She smiles sagely. “This is why you get your Michaela Coels, your Shonda Rhimes, your Mindy Kalings. At some point, if you’re those kinds of women, nothing is being written that’s reflective of who you are.” Syal once said that female actors had “dog years – one of ours is seven of anybody else’s.” Now she thinks things are slowly improving from the days when older women were “in the wasteland, that terrible middle section where you’re not considered sexy or fertile any more. And you certainly won’t be playing wives of 50-year-old men, because they’ll be played by 30-year-olds.” That’s not to say she doesn’t think there’s a way to go. “There’s still a lot of supportive older women roles, where you’re basically there to say to blokes,” Syal flings out a hand and turns her voice into a coo: “‘Be careful out there!’ But it is changing.” Among projects coming up, Syal will appear alongside Jessica Raine and Peter Capaldi in The Devil’s Hour for Amazon Prime. A certain royal personage may be interested to learn that Syal will also be imminently recording a new series of Gossip and Goddesses With Granny Kumar, the Radio 4 show she conceived during lockdown as “a way of interviewing women you don’t see on the usual chat shows”. “It’s the perfect part,” grins Syal, “I can play this into my 80s. It’s the gift that keeps on giving.” Her life-advice to her younger self would be: “It’s a marathon not a sprint.” You get the feeling she will stay busy: acting, writing, crafting, shapeshifting. “Sometimes you have to suck it and see, see what works,” says Syal. “Because it’s better than not doing anything. Just trying to keep creative.” Roar starts on Apple TV+ on 15 April",Arts/Culture,Meera Syal: ‘It’s a golden age for TV – the streamers have kicked us all up the arse’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/10/meera-syal-interview-roar-devils-hour-kumars
4/10/2022,"Dance takes many forms and can fulfil multiple functions. Over his career, the choreographer William Forsythe has explored most of them. When he started out, he was hailed as the successor to Balanchine, a creator of work full of off-kilter balances, striking juxtapositions and unexpected twists and turns, but clearly rooted in the classical tradition. Yet he has also always been fascinated by what dance can communicate, and has taken challenging journeys into more experimental territory, mingling words and micro-movements to create his effects. A lot of his early admirers disliked the exploring; I found it difficult but still more stimulating than anything around it. Now in his 70s and a freelance without the burdens of his own company, he has turned again to ballet in its purest form, but teamed its bravura steps and expressive symmetries with pop music. The result is deliriously gorgeous, a sugar rush straight to the heart that leaves you cheering and breathless with joy. The Forsythe Evening by English National Ballet pairs Blake Works 1, set to James Blake’s album The Colour in Anything and created for Paris Opera Ballet in 2016, with Playlist (EP), a new version of the work he made for ENB’s men in 2018, now expanded to include women, and danced to a propulsive, funky score, including Lion Babe’s Impossible and Natalie Cole’s Everlasting Love. It’s this second piece, with its great sweeps of women in formation like a jazzy chorus line – throwing off pirouettes, flicking their feet and changing direction like so many spinning tops – and the men defying gravity to jump across the stage, swaggering like jocks, that brings the audience to its feet. It’s not just the elevation that thrills, it’s the weight, the way the dancers slope on, swinging their arms as if at a disco, and then suddenly fly. They own it. Blake Works is less overtly showy, but almost unbearably beautiful, with its groups moving contrapuntally, building patterns of beats and extensions, holding poses for a split second longer than you’d expect, and then snapping to change direction just that bit faster. There’s a duet for Isaac Hernández and Emily Suzuki that’s full of tender gestures with the hands; there’s a section for the women, marked by sweeping arms and grace. It’s heavenly. In addition to his choreography, Forsythe has built a set of computer programmes around dance-making; the programmes are popular, apparently, with hip-hop dancers and you can see why. The forms are different but have in common the qualities of groups moving in unison, of flexion and control through the limbs. Ivan Michael Blackstock’s Traplord, a bold, brave, upsetting examination of depression and the pressures of black masculinity, also shares Forsythe’s belief that you can say anything through movement. It’s a truly impressive piece, a confident mixture of speech, theatre, music and dance (by Blackstock and associate choreographer Chaldon Williams), tied together by Ian William Galloway’s video design, which means that at moments the dancers seem both to be real and part of a disturbing game being played. Blackstock stalks the world, a nervous figure in rabbit ears, often isolated, striving to be the perfect human. A dancer dons a pig mask and becomes a symbol of police brutality, breaking Kanah Flex’s apparently boneless body, until he can sling it over his shoulder like a dummy. A figure raps about becoming more powerful, egged on by his gang. It feels incredibly honest; it’s also extraordinarily powerful.

4/10/2022,"Raphael, at the National Gallery, is a revelation. It could hardly be otherwise, in a sense, since this is the first exhibition outside Italy ever to encompass every aspect of his stupendous career. It runs through paint, chalk and print, wool, bronze and ink, and from the earliest drawing of himself at 15, with doe eyes and a half-formed nose, to the last startling self-portrait where Raphael paints himself with a fellow artist who points to the mirror as if looking to the future, at themselves and also us: one of the greatest double acts in the history of art. That picture has come from the Louvre, and it is a testimony to the extraordinary pulling power of the gallery and its exemplary curators that they have been able to bring together 89 works from all over the world. Here are his apprentice works and the final masterpieces made just before his death at 37; here are his visions of tranquil saints and tense philosophers, sultry beauties and soaring apostles, his friends, his colleagues, his amused and flirtatious lover. In room after room, singing with Raphael’s radiant red-blue-green palette, you are able to walk through his art and life as never before. Which is vital, for Raphael has sometimes seemed the most elusive of old masters. The shape of his life is familiar enough from the ecstatic hagiography of his first biographer, Vasari. Born in Urbino in 1483, orphaned at 11, the prodigy is a master painter at 17. He leaves his hilltop birthplace for Perugia, where he learns from Perugino, then Florence, where he picks up Leonardo’s smoky technique. In Rome, by now intensely successful, he works for two popes and their Vatican bankers and is allowed surreptitious sightings of Michelangelo’s progress in the Sistine Chapel, from which he also learns. There follow cartoons for the Sistine tapestries, drawings for bestselling prints, designs for St Peter’s Basilica – you can see them all here – and the running of an enormous workshop. Raphael was also working on the so-called Vatican Stanze, those immense murals alas bypassed by most visitors in favour of Michelangelo, when he died in 1520. Vasari tells us that Raphael was fatally weakened by too much lovemaking. He was apparently amorous. The smiling woman in La Fornarina, said to be his mistress, holds one bare breast while pointing at an armband bearing his name, as if she belonged to him. The connotations are hard to take, at least to modern eyes, and yet her sidelong eyes hold a smile as if she too is in on a joke. It was Good Friday when Raphael died. According to Vasari, his death was like a second passion. The saint of painting was everywhere mourned for the perfection of his art; a perfection, especially of draughtsmanship and harmonious design, that represented the evolutionary pinnacle to which artists would aspire for the next three centuries. But it is this very emphasis on perfection – purity, balance, grace, the immaculate line, the sweetness of what Browning called the “dear Madonnas”, the artist of angels who drew like an angel, and so forth – all of it blocks the view. What is so exhilarating about this show is that it offers a chance to see past the old academic praise and to look at Raphael whole. There are, to be sure, paintings that appear almost bafflingly serene. Saint Catherine of Alexandria poses in exquisite torsion, everything rippling upwards, from her soft drapes to her knees, thighs and sashaying hips, right up to the gracefully upturning face. Leaning on a wheel, emblem of the horrific torture she endured, she could be modelling martyrdom as the latest look. The concept is either absurd or it is ideal, if you prefer your martyrs flawless and untroubled, rising above it all. Saint George smites the dragon with supreme ease, showing off his long-line armour all the way from upraised wrist to elegant, gleaming toe. Saint Michael lands lightly upon the monstrous body of Lucifer in a balletic jeté. Suppressing evil appears remarkably stylish and simple. But then look at a late drawing of an apostle, made for the great Transfiguration Raphael was painting at his death. A single head, in black chalk, the line appearing and then mysteriously disappearing to describe light on the dark curls, on the heavy eyelid, on the lowest tendril of the beard as the apostle looks down in silent despair. He does not yet know what we see above: that Jesus Christ is risen. Arriving from Urbino, where it was made, is a rarely seen portrait known as La Muta. It shows a young woman in courtly dress, hair finely plaited, all the usual Renaissance jewellery. She has a very slight cast in her brown eyes, but more than that an appearance of watchful remoteness. One of her fingers is tensely flexed on the bottom edge of the painting, and she sits in encroaching blackness. It is no stretch to imagine that this profound portrait shows a woman who cannot speak or cannot hear, or perhaps both. Raphael drew from living models. There are tremendous sequences of male nudes straining back a bow to shoot an arrow in battle, except that there is no bow. An exquisite red chalk sketch of a child with its arms upraised, as if about to lift off, will be transformed into an angel. God himself looks an athlete at the end of a race, arms triumphantly outflung. And the more you look at Raphael’s drawings, so peerless, so lithe in their descriptive power, so quick with the maker’s touch, the more you see how the sight of life affects his paintings. For every idealised Madonna, there is a real mother touching, holding, guiding, cradling, protecting a real infant. Is there a more beautifully instinctive painting of a mother holding her baby than The Tempi Madonna from Munich? He is three or four months old, growing plump and upright, and just edging towards an independence she carefully supports with one hand below his bottom and the other round his back. It is affecting to think that Raphael, an orphan with no children, saw and depicted this intimacy with such closeness. And that tenderness is there in his portraits of men as well as women. Raphael’s friend Bindo Altoviti turns dramatically towards us with his liquid blue eyes and long blond hair. Look at the downy sideburns descending almost to his jaw and you are seeing Raphael, transfixed, seduce you too with his brush until you could reach forward and stroke that cheek. Was there ever a portrait more tactile, irresistibly calling on the sense of touch? If the sight of life deepens his art, so does personal insight. A high point of this show is Raphael’s startling painting of his great friend Baldassare Castiglione, diplomat, humanist and celebrated author of The Book of the Courtier. The face is all open intelligence and sensitivity; the demeanour a perfect expression of “sprezzatura”, that effortless grace recommended in Castiglione’s book. But the portrait has an immediacy quite unlike anything in Raphael’s idealised art. Titian, Rembrandt and Ingres all based portraits on the originality of Raphael’s half-turned, conversational composition. But most unique is the notch in the black hat, with its extraordinary zigzag sharpness: open like a speaking mouth.

4/10/2022,"Robin Dunbar sets out to offer nothing less than “an overarching theory for why and how humans are religious”. Unlike most writers on such themes, he is largely uninterested in the truth or otherwise of religious claims and has little to say about the damage caused by religions, although he does touch on their “militant violence” and the predatory promiscuity we find among the charismatic leaders of small cults. But he is intrigued by the “seeming universality” of religions and their constant tendency to fragment. His stimulating and hugely ambitious book, therefore, uses a variety of different approaches to throw light on three really big questions: “the functions that religion has served”, “the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms that make this possible” and “the timing of the origins of religion”. At the emotional heart of religion, as Dunbar sees it, is something he calls “the mystical stance”, which includes “a susceptibility to enter trance-like states”, “belief in a transcendental (or spirit) world” and “a belief that we can call on hidden power(s) to help us”. Though sophisticated systems of theology have obviously been built on these foundations, “beneath the surface veneer of doctrinal rectitude lurks an ancient foundation of pagan mystical religion”. One of the key questions is how the original immersive or shamanic forms of religion develop into elaborate doctrinal religions. Since Dunbar is emeritus professor of evolutionary psychology at the University of Oxford, his book is “firmly grounded in our current understanding of evolutionary theory”. Those who sign up to religions, he points out, “can incur serious costs in terms of self-imposed pain, celibacy and even self-sacrifice”. This raises obvious moral issues, but it also makes little evolutionary sense for creatures struggling to survive and reproduce. So do religions offer some countervailing benefits to individuals or communities? Or are they “the maladaptive byproduct of traits or cognitive processes that evolved for other perfectly respectable biological purposes”, like the lower back pain we have to put up with in return for the advantages of walking upright? Here, Dunbar surveys the key evolutionary explanations for religions, the evidence that they make people healthier and happier and their role in building a sense of cohesion (which apparently means that religious communities tend to be larger and longer-lasting than their secular equivalents). He also makes use of “nearly two decades of research… on the nature of sociality and the mechanisms of community bonding in primates and humans”. One of the strange things Dunbar is famous for is the number 150. He has argued in several earlier books – such as How Many Friends Does One Person Need? – that this is a “natural” size for human groups, as large as possible while still allowing us to organise our social interactions by keeping track of all the individual members. Evidence for this claim, he suggests here, comes from research on “wedding guest lists”, Facebook friends and “egocentric social networks” (the number of friends and family we make a conscious effort to keep in touch with) and, more particularly, from “the typical size of hunter-gatherer communities, the form of society in which we have spent more than 95% of our existence as a species”. While other primates resolve conflicts and maintain cohesion in much smaller groups largely by grooming each other, humans rely on laughing, singing, dancing and feasting – and the rituals of religion – to release endorphins and overcome the inevitable tensions. Yet as societies get bigger, we keep hitting a series of glass ceilings that require more and more elaborate and law-like forms of religion to prevent breakdown. How Religion Evolved offers insights into why “all the great world religions emerged within the very narrow latitudinal band of the northern subtropical zone that lies immediately above the tropics”. It also sketches in a four-phase model, taking us all the way from “informal, immersive… ancestral religions”, which were “designed to bond very small hunter-gatherer communities of 100-200 individuals living in dispersed camps of 35-50”, through to the much more formal styles of religion, incorporating temples, professional priests and complex rituals, which emerged about 4,000 years ago alongside “a dramatic rise in the size of settlements and the polities within which these are embedded”. The result is a compelling intellectual workout. Dunbar offers a powerful central argument, an excellent survey of alternative theories and a wide range of vivid and illuminating examples. These take in extreme and painful rituals, wishing wells and malicious witches, experiments exploring the impact of synchrony in rowers and the common fears among those visiting spirit worlds while in a trance that they will never be able to find their way back to the real world. Many people today are, of course, indifferent, if not actively hostile, to religion. Yet it would be a pity if that led them to miss this book. If Dunbar is right that religion is “unlikely to have evolved before the appearance of anatomically modern humans around 200,000 years ago”, that also makes it “something that sets humans apart”. The story he tells is important to us all. How Religion Evolved: And Why It Endures by Robin Dunbar is published by Pelican (£22).

4/10/2022,"A dietary supplement sold in the UK could be toxic and should not be used until it has been shown to be safe, an international group of biologists has warned. The team, from Manchester and Kyoto universities, reported last week that the supplement – known as SAMe – can break down inside the body into substances that cause a wide range of medical problems, including kidney and liver damage Short for S-adenosylmethionine, SAMe is marketed online in the UK as an agent that can help a range of conditions, including joints and liver diseases, and promote emotional wellbeing. But Jean-Michel Fustin, of Manchester University, said experiments that he and his collaborators had carried out had revealed that SAMe breaks down into adenine and methylthioadenosine in the body. These substances are known to be toxic, he added. “This discovery came out of the blue,” Fustin said last week. “When we gave the supplement to mice we expected they would become healthier. But instead we found the opposite. We found that when SAMe breaks down in the body, it produces very toxic molecules, including adenine which causes gout, kidney disease and liver disease.” Fustin added that although their study – which was published in Communications Biology last week – was carried out on mice, their results were relevant for humans. “We have not yet tested the supplement on men and women but we have added it to human cells in laboratory cultures and have found it had the same effect as it had on mice.” SAMe is not sold over the counter in pharmacies in the UK. However, numerous companies offer the supplement for sale on the internet as an agent for promoting joint comfort, liver health, mobility and “a positive mood”. It is also marketed as an agent for promoting liver health in dogs and cats on some sites. “We studied the impact that SAMe had on the body clocks of mice and found that instead of improving them, their biological rhythms got slower and slower. It was clear something was wrong,” said Fustin. Their study, which was funded by the Medical Research Council and the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science, makes it clear that the health benefits of SAMe are questionable, to say the very least, Fustin added. “It is unclear what dose of it might be safe, so there is a good chance that a safe dose will be exceeded if someone takes this supplement – if a safe dose exists at all.” The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MRHA) has been asked for a response.",News/Society,Biologists warn against toxic SAMe ‘health’ supplement,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/10/biologists-warn-against-toxic-same-health-supplement
4/10/2022,"It’s often the majestic opulence of the Alhambra or the craggy peaks of the Sierra Nevada that lure visitors to the southern Spanish city of Granada. But it takes just minutes in one of the local bars – whether a heaving, dimly-lit tavern or a space where wine barrels stand in for tables – to discover another of the city’s charms: the free tapas that come with most drink orders. While olives and crisps flow freely in bars across Spain, Granada’s establishments have long gone the extra mile, serving up deluxe tapas that range from deep-fried shrimp to hearty patatas bravas. But in recent days, the city has been gripped by a debate that cuts to the core of this ubiquitous tradition. The catalyst came from the city’s mayor after he seemingly took a dig at the custom while speaking at a festival celebrating local gastronomy. “The city council will no longer promote free tapas,” said Paco Cuenca. “Never again.” He pointed to economics to back his view, describing paid-for tapas as a means to bolster the restaurant industry and foster a local take on the high-end gastronomy that draws millions of tourists a year to Spain. “One has to pay for tapas because they’re haute cuisine,” he added. “That’s what leads to profitability and creates stable jobs.” News of his remarks travelled swiftly along the hundreds of bars that line the city’s winding alleyways and narrow streets. Media from across the country swooped in to cover the polemic in the ciudad de la tapa – city of the tapa – asking whether this was the end of free tapas in Granada or pronouncing that the mayor had “declared war” on the tradition. The conversation lit up the inbox of Gayle Mackie, who has run tapas tours in the city since 2006. “I got the link about 10 times on the same day,” said Mackie. “It was sort of a ‘shock, horror, look at this’.” She described the mayor’s push for change as quixotic. For Granadiños, “the tapa is sacred,” she said. “Having a tapa is ingrained in the lifestyle here.” As misinformation began to swirl about the city’s plans, the mayor swiftly moved to set the record straight. “As if we’re going to ban them! They’re part of the essence of Granada, and I want them in my city,” Cuenca said in a video posted online. Still, the debate raged on. Some people were quick to point out that Granada’s tapas are hardly free: drinks in the city are often sold at an inflated price to compensate for the handout. A cold beer, for example, will run up a bill of around €2.50 in Granada, compared to €1.50 or €2 in similarly-sized cities, noted the newspaper El País. Others joined the mayor to call for change. “Let’s be honest, many of the supposedly free tapas in Granada are not free, nor are they tasty, nor can you choose them,” said local journalist Cecilia Cano on Twitter. “Yes to tapa, of course, but I prefer to pay for it, choose it and eat well.” The debate cast a spotlight on a conversation that has quietly been playing out in the city as a smattering of restaurants attempt to carve out a culture of higher-end, paid tapas, said Gregorio Garcia, who leads the federation that represents Granada’s hospitality industry. “There’s a saying here that says with three tapas in Granada you’ve had a meal,” said Garcia. “So the people in restaurants say, if they’re eating tapas, what do we do?” His association has long pushed to make space in the city for a wider variety of bars and restaurants, in hopes of better catering to palates that range from cash-starved university students to high-rolling tourists. “In the end, I think it would be very difficult to do away with the tapa in Granada,” he said. “It’s something that you can’t get rid of. What we should do is give people other options.”",News/World news,Residents of Granada rally round to protect their sacred tapas,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/10/residents-of-granada-rally-round-to-protect-their-sacred-tapas
4/10/2022,"A friend admitted to me recently how much she loves lip gloss. She said it sheepishly, like it was a dirty secret: “I know it is a bit tacky…” Well, actually it’s not. On any level. Yes, the formulation used to be tacky, but now it’s much more sophisticated. And you can get a slightly more understated gloss look – it needn’t be gooey – with a glossy lipstick. Which makes it easier to channel Studio 54 meets stealth wealth. Keep everything else simple and just let your lips shine. 1. Fenty Beauty Gloss Bomb £18, boots.com2.

Tom Ford Soleil Ultra Shine Lip Color £44, tomford.co.uk Powders have a terrible reputation. Their original purpose was to absorb excess oil, give your makeup a velvety finish and set everything in place. Instead, what we largely have is a product that gives you a caked look, and gets stuck in the creases and crevices of the skin, making you look older than Methuselah (and at this point your skin also looks dead). And if you have dark skin by now you also look very grey. It’s not surprising that many of us balk at the idea of powders. However, there is a new wave worth tapping into, all down to a beautiful, modern and really sublime formulation. This one from Hermès is at the very top of the game. The powder is mattifying, but leaves you radiant. It is so finely milled and exquisitely developed that it is barely perceptible on the skin. In fact, as the name suggests it has such an air-like quality to it – so unlike other powders – you feel as if you are wearing nothing. And even if you have to reapply it during the day, it adds no weight. The most impressive thing about it, however, is that it includes emollients – so it is really beneficial to the skin. A powder that has skincare qualities, leaves your make up with the perfect finish without leaving you flat? When you consider the glut of skin-deadening powders on the market right now, this truly is a triumph.

4/10/2022,"More than three-quarters of the public are in favour of windfarms being built in the UK. That is the key result of an Opinium poll carried out for the Observer in the wake of publication of the government’s controversial energy security plans last week. Ministers backed nuclear power but shunned new onshore wind plants as the main means for protecting the UK against future energy crises. But the new poll indicates Tory voters’ backing for wind turbines almost matches that of Labour and Lib Dem supporters – suggesting the move against onshore wind, a result of backbench Conservative pressure, runs counter to the views of the party’s own voters. In the Opinium poll, 79% of Tory voters said they were strongly or somewhat in favour of windfarms being installed in the UK, compared with 83% of Labour voters and 88% of Lib Dems. Two-thirds of all voters said they would be happy for a windfarm to be built near them. By contrast, only 46% of all voters favoured new nuclear power stations in principle, while a mere 32% favoured gas power plants. Less than a third of voters would be happy with a nuclear power station being built near them, while less than a quarter would approve of having a gas power station in their neighbourhood. These findings suggest that government thinking is at some distance from the public’s perception of the need to ensure energy security while still working to achieve net zero emissions. It is also at odds with warnings from experts who say reliance on atomic power raises key concerns for the nation. They point out that the country’s next nuclear plant, Hinkley Point C, currently under construction in Somerset, was supposed to start generating electricity in 2017 but will not do so until 2026 because of delays that have raised the station’s cost from £16bn to £23bn. “Instead of this wasteful nuclear plan, the government should invest in onshore wind to help lower people’s bills now,” said the Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey. “Safely storing nuclear waste is also expensive, complicated and controversial.” However, former Tory energy minister Charles Hendry – who now advises the energy industry – said he was pleased the government had committed to more nuclear but doubted whether the funding model for building new plants would attract enough private sector interest. The government needed to address whether it should take on the entire funding of the building of the plants, he said. “That happens in almost every other country in the world. Then if it chooses to, when they are built, it can sell them off to the private sector. That is the most assured way of getting the investment which is necessary and the partnerships which are necessary.” But scientists are warning that heavy reliance on atomic energy is premature when the critical issue of nuclear waste disposal has yet to be tackled. The UK has still not selected a site to build an underground store for the spent fuel rods and radioactive cladding it has accumulated over the past seven decades of operating nuclear plants. Most of the nation’s nuclear waste is still stored above ground, at Sellafield in Cumbria. “We need to build an underground store that is acceptable to local people, that is geologically stable, and which is big enough to store the 750,000 cubic metres of nuclear waste that we will have accumulated once all our current reactors are in operation,” said Prof Claire Corkhill of Sheffield University. “That will take another decade at best. Only then would I be happy to know another eight nuclear power plants were going to be built in the UK.” In 2019, the UK relaunched its efforts to get agreement to build an underground nuclear waste facility. So far residents in four areas – three in Cumbria and one in Lincolnshire – have entered the voluntary process to explore whether it would be possible to have the store built in their neighbourhood. Drilling to test how subterranean water flow might damage a facility in each area will be carried out in the near future. Then, if the rocks there are found to be suitable, geologists will have to estimate if a sufficiently large underground store could be built in that location. “We could find an area has good rocks but … not sufficient space to store all the waste we need to bury,” added Corkhill. “Then we might have to try to find a second, or entirely new site. This is not an issue we can rush.”",News/Environment,"Three-quarters of Britons back expansion of wind power, poll reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/10/three-quarters-of-britons-back-expansion-of-wind-power-poll-reveals
