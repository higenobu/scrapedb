3/11/2022,"Russia can expect a “dramatic increased response” from the west if Vladimir Putin uses chemical weapons in Ukraine, a minister has said, amid fears that a false pretext is being laid by Moscow for such an attack. Chris Philp, the technology minister, accused Russia of sharing disinformation online to create a false narrative that Ukraine is preparing to use chemical weapons, so that Russia can launch its own chemical attack. His comments echo those made on Thursday by Boris Johnson, who said he feared that the “barbaric” regime in the Kremlin may be ready to use the banned weapons as the invading Russian forces had failed to make the progress expected. Philp told Sky News: “We have seen in the last 24 or 48 hours what appear to be bits of disinformation published by Russian state outlets, including in fact the Russian embassy here in London, putting on things like Twitter information that appear to be creating a false narrative that Ukrainians are considering using chemical weapons, which is clearly ridiculous and totally untrue. “Sometimes they do that in preparation but I hope that’s not what they’re contemplating. The use of chemical weapons in any theatre of war, certainly one where there are lots of civilians, is totally unacceptable.” Philp said any such use of weapons would “trigger an increased response from the west”. He told Times Radio: “Clearly, the use of chemical weapons, especially in an invasion where there are a very large number of civilians, would be an outrage against humanity. I would say to anybody in Russia thinking about this: do not cross that line, do not inflict any more misery and suffering on the Ukrainian people. “They’ve already been shooting civilians who are fleeing down humanitarian escape corridors, they’ve been bombing and shelling hospitals including a children’s/maternity hospital. Do not go any further in inflicting misery on the Ukrainian people. “It will trigger an increased response from the west, there’s a dramatic increased response, there’s no question about that. I’m not going to speculate about the form that’s going to take or pre-empt it, but that’s a line that Russian governments should not cross.” Johnson and the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, have raised fears of the use of chemical weapons by Russian forces, while the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said the world should be “on the lookout” for the Russian use of chemical and biological weaponry. Johnson said on Thursday: “The stuff which you are hearing about chemical weapons is straight out of the Russian playbook. They start saying that there are chemical weapons that are being stored by their opponents or by the Americans, so that when they themselves deploy chemical weapons – as I fear they may – they have a sort of a maskirovka, a fake story, ready to go.” In a reference to the Salisbury nerve agent attack, he added: “You have seen it in Syria, you saw it even in the UK. I just note that is what they are already doing. It is a cynical, barbaric government, I’m afraid.”",News/Politics,UK minister warns Russia against using chemical weapons in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/11/uk-minister-warns-russia-against-using-chemical-weapons-in-ukraine
3/11/2022,"The National Farmers’ Union has warned of a huge drop in UK-grown crops, including peppers, cucumbers and aubergines, as it becomes too expensive to produce them. The NFU said producers of crops who use glasshouses are looking at a drop of up to 50% in the amount they can afford to grow because of the crippling increase in the cost of the gas they use for heating. “The impact is being felt most in the protected crop sectors, that’s aubergines, peppers, cucumbers,” said Minette Batters, the president of the NFU, speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We are already seeing massive contraction, these costs are making it impossible to grow. The only thing is to keep these glasshouses empty.” She said producers are saying the number of cucumbers that will be grown annually could fall from 80m to 35m, while pepper production could halve from 100m. She also added that inflation was leading to dramatic rises in other areas, citing the example of the cost of raising a chicken increasing by 50% in a year for farmers. She said the NFU had asked the government to treat the situation as a “matter of urgency”, potentially intervening and prioritising gas demand. “We have really got to look at the gas requirements for the whole industry and where to look to intervene otherwise we are going to see less British production,” she said. Batters added that wider issues, such as the record price of wheat and the potential reduction in exports from the big producers Russia and Ukraine because of the war, were also serving to fuel inflation and supply issues. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has said it does not expect any significant impact on UK food supply. Batters said: “I think if you spoke to any producer they would be saying exactly the same as we are. This is a global market we all operate in. We have to act to make sure that everybody can have affordable food. But most importantly that we don’t contract production. That is the essential bit. “Otherwise we are going to see more situations like the glasshouses where growers are not planting. These are going into landfill, these plants, at the moment as they cannot afford to plant them. We have to intervene to make sure these businesses can stay operational and keep producing what the country wants.”",News/Environment,UK farmers warn soaring gas costs could cut food production,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/11/uk-farmers-warn-soaring-gas-costs-could-cut-food-production
3/11/2022,"If you were into video games in the 1980s or 90s, then along with your computer, your QuickShot joystick and your tape player, there was one other vital component of your set-up: a games magazine. For me it was Zzap! 64, a glossy mag dedicated to the Commodore 64 with brilliant, opinionated writers, excellent features, and an exhaustive tips section. I would rush to the newsagent on publication day, bring it home with almost religious reverence, then read it from cover to cover. And then I would go back and read it again. This was how I discovered new games such as Sentinel, Elite and Leaderboard, but also, through the letters page and competitions, joined a community of players, years before the world wide web allowed us all to get in contact. In the 80s, video game magazines were the internet. In the mid-90s I was lucky enough to get a job at Future, one of the leading publishers of gaming magazines in Britain. This was the absolute heyday for the industry – as a writer on Edge magazine, I shared offices with the acclaimed Nintendo magazine Superplay, the wildly enthusiastic GamesMaster, the anarchic Amiga Power and a burgeoning Official PlayStation Magazine, which would go on to rival FHM and even the Radio Times in monthly circulation. Producing a magazine was a labour of love – a constant battle between our desire to play and cover everything and the restraints of page counts and print deadlines. Conveying the excitement of a new Resident Evil or Tekken title in prose, images and captions, was a skill that took months to learn. Readers weren’t just consumers, they were acolytes. Magazines were like football teams: if you read PC Gamer, you didn’t go near PC Zone; if you loved Computer and Video Games magazine, you side-eyed Mean Machines. Like the old rivalry between NME and Melody Maker, the actual content of the magazines was almost secondary to the gang affiliation. These things mattered. Look at the newsagent shelves now and it’s a different story. Future, still a huge force in games media, publishes just four print magazines in the field – Edge, PC Gamer, Retro Gamer and Play. Elsewhere, most publications are aimed at children and tweens – the likes of Toxic and 110% Gaming with their covermounts and endless features on Fortnite and Minecraft. The news, the reviews, the communities – they are now online in the form of gaming sites, Reddit forums, Discord servers and Twitch streams. What use is there in the 21st century for the monthly cycle of the magazine when everything is available online immediately? But quietly, and away from traditional high-street newsagents, game magazines have started to make a comeback. Partly, this has been fed by a surge of gaming nostalgia, engendered by the availability of classic titles on digital stores, as well as the craze for retro “mini” consoles. Veteran gamers in their 30s and 40s, exhausted by 100-hour adventures and endless live service games, are looking back on the simpler days of the Speccy or the Mega Drive or the original PlayStation with a sense of yearning reverie – and there’s a shared understanding that print mags were a huge part of that era. Jonah Naylor runs an IT services company but back in the 80s he trained as a local newspaper reporter – and also loved video games. “My first computer was a ‘Rubber Key’ ZX Spectrum, before I moved to the Amstrad CPC range, and then to Amiga. Magazines and computers have always had an important relationship, I remember reading Amstrad Action and Amiga Format magazines religiously - print was the only decent source of computer and gaming news back then!” A couple of years ago he started to really miss the Amiga scene and on discovering there were no magazines still running, he gathered a group of similarly nostalgic gaming friends and decided to launch one. Reaching out to the online Amiga community, he managed to secure enough funds to work on a launch issue, which he printed via a local firm. The resulting magazine, Amiga Addict, is a bright, brash paean to its 90s forebears, covering classic titles and developers such as DMA and Psygnosis, but also reporting on the current Amiga community. Originally only available online, it will soon be going on sale at more than 300 newsagents nationwide. And Amiga Addict is not alone. The Commodore 64 magazine Freeze64, which takes its style cues from Zzzap!, has been around since 2017 featuring retro reviews and interviews with legendary developers. On the console side, Ninty Fresh has been running since a successful kickstarter in 2020, covering Nintendo machines from the NES onwards and theming each issue around classic titles such as F-Zero, Metroid and Zelda. The latest example is Sega Powered, another Kickstartered print project, this time headed by Dean Mortlock who edited Future’s classic Sega Power and Saturn Power magazines back in the 90s. “We’ll cover new titles from Sega, as well as indie releases in the reviews section,” says Mortlock. “We’ll also be slowly working our way through the Sega back catalogue in the re-reviews section. This is where we take the old games and see how well they’ve stood the test of time. Additionally, we’ll cover what’s happening in homebrew gaming, as that does throw up some interesting and original games and conversions – which often go unnoticed.” All of these magazines have their roots in old school gaming communities, but there’s more to the return of games magazines than industry nostalgia. The independent print publishing sector has been going through a revival for more than a decade, buoyed by falling costs, accessible desktop publishing software and the rise of small-scale independent printing companies willing to take on limited print runs. “It is often compared to the return of records,” says Daniel McCabe manager of the brilliant magazine store Magalleria in Bath. “In the same way many young people today completely missed the vinyl age, they’re all now discovering the joy of analogue. “The modern, more high-spec magazine feeds our inner craving for tactility in a digital age. That is, the magazine offers touch, smell and even a change of pace – sure, you can curl up with your mobile phone but, where practical, a print magazine is more immersive and transporting. They offer a break from ‘instant’ and ‘non-stop’ media.” Now a freelance graphic designer, Caspian Whistler started making gaming zines back when he was studying at the University of the Arts in London. “At the time, games discourse felt very bleak to me, so I wanted to create something celebratory and optimistic to try and reclaim a bit of my love for the medium. I’d become quite enamoured with print publications while on my course. Being exposed to all these amazing, high end publications for other areas of the arts and culture sector really made me wonder why there was so little out there that gave games the same treatment.” At first Whistler was doing all the writing and design himself as a side project, but when he posted images of the zine on a forum, he was amazed by the positive response he got. In 2016 he turned to Kickstarter, looking for £20k to make the debut issue of A Profound Waste of Time, a beautiful, contemporary gaming magazine printed on high-quality paper stock, with illustrations by talented designers and in-depth articles on current games culture. By the time the crowdfunding period closed he’d raised £39k. The second issue, published last year, was even more ambitious, featuring a booklet insert and prismatic holographic cover. “I’m constantly trying to find unique ways of utilising the physicality of the medium in ways that pixels and screens can’t replicate,” he says. “Foldout sections, paper stocks, die-cut pages, tip ins ... There’s a lot of work put into justifying the mag’s existence in ink and paper. If we’re going to cut down a tree, I want to do something as special as I can with it.” What all of these magazines confirm is an aspect of gaming that often gets overlooked. This is not a purely digital medium – it is haptic, it relies on touch and feel – the click of a button, the swoop of a rotated anologue stick, the swish of a mouse. Magazines reflect this tangible pleasure. There is a sensuousness to turning pages, to running your fingers across a matt-printed surface. And unlike a website or instagram feed, a magazine offers a discrete, focused experience: it’s not accompanied by a dozen other digital apps, notifications and alerts. It’s a respite from screen fatigue, an excuse to totally indulge in something carefully edited and curated. On Edge magazine, the most exciting day of the month was when the new issues arrived. They came in boxes of 50, bound together with plastic ties. We’d prise them out with great care, and finally, you would see the cover, all glossy and real, and you could flick through and find your words rendered into something concrete and lasting. Every single time I opened one of those boxes it reminded me of cycling home with the latest copy of Zzap! 64 in my bag, wondering what games I would discover, and what worlds would open up in its pages.",Arts/Games,Paper view: the return of video game magazines,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/mar/11/paper-view-the-return-of-video-game-magazines
3/11/2022,"Pixar is masterful at introducing unusual subjects into its family animations. This fun, perceptive film from Domee Shi, who made the touching short Bao, takes female puberty as its theme. Meilin, a 13-year-old Chinese-Canadian girl living in Toronto, is a booksmart, dutiful daughter until hit by a family curse – passed down the female line – that turns her into a giant red panda when she is overexcited. With her musical idols, boyband 4*Town (songs by Billie Eilish and Finneas), coming to town, opportunities for emotional turmoil are rife. Chinese art-inspired visuals mix with pop culture in a heartwarming comedy that fizzes with life, teenage and otherwise.Out now, Disney+ Quentin Tarantino’s unashamed love letter to the American film and television industry is a tour de force of pinpoint pastiche and counterfactual drama. It’s 1969, and Leonardo DiCaprio’s actor Rick Dalton is negotiating a declining career alongside stuntman best pal Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt, never more laid-back). They live next to Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) and Roman Polanski, so the Manson “family” cast a shadow, but for the most part it’s a nostalgic ride saturated in the pop culture of the time. Even LA’s neon signs get their moment to shine.Saturday 12 March, 9pm, Channel 4 Showing in a double bill with his 2020 Tilda Swinton-starring short The Human Voice, Pedro Almodóvar’s 2019 drama is his most autobiographical yet. A surprisingly subdued Antonio Banderas stars as Salvador, a feted, ageing director beset by ailments that have curtailed his career and stunted his pleasure in life. When he starts taking heroin to alleviate his aches, memories of his childhood and mother (Penélope Cruz) flood back – at the same time as figures from his past reappear – revealing a richly creative existence that should be far from over.Saturday 12 March, 9pm, BBC Four London, 1880. A bloody serial killer is rampant, and out-of-favour Scotland Yard detective John Kildare (a maudlin Bill Nighy) is given the poisoned chalice of trying to close an impossible case. Adapted from Peter Ackroyd’s novel, Juan Carlos Medina’s crime mystery roams thrillingly through the underbelly of Victorian life, from the sordid backstreets to the music hall stage. It’s there that Olivia Cooke’s hard-up but ambitious Lizzie finds a mentor in the great performer Dan Leno (Douglas Booth) but gets drawn into Kildare’s investigation.Saturday 12 March, 11.05pm, BBC One With Will Smith a frontrunner again for an Oscar with tennis tale King Richard, here’s a chance to see another of his nominated performances. In Michael Mann’s bold, sweeping 2001 biopic he brings natural charm and wit to the role of Muhammad Ali – from 1964 when the boxer was still Cassius Clay to his comeback in the intensely dramatic Rumble in the Jungle fight in 1974. With such a larger-than-life character, the film struggles at times to glean insight but it’s a victory on points.Sunday 13 March, 10pm, BBC Two It is easy to forget the impact the actor Audrey Hepburn made in the mid-1950s. With her open face, ballerina’s poise and Givenchy-styled look, she epitomised a thoroughly modern female lifestyle. The camera loved her and this insightful documentary from Helena Coan makes the most of it, while audio interviews reveal her insecurity about her public image and private relationships. After her semi-retirement at the end of the 60s, her work with Unicef in the late 80s brought her back into the public eye.

3/11/2022,"The rescheduling of events to avoid warmer Beijing weather forecast for the weekend made for a busy Friday at the 2022 Winter Paralympics, with medals available in Alpine skiing, biathlon and snowboarding, and the para ice hockey and wheelchair curling competitions reaching the semi-final stages. Britain’s Ollie Hill picked up the first ever ParalympicsGB medal in snowboarding. He went into his second run laughing and clapping as he knew his first run time of 1min 10.45sec was enough to have guaranteed him at least the bronze in the men’s banked slalom SB-LL2. With snow conditions deteriorating, like the majority of athletes he could not improve on his time, and so finished third. Sun Qi of China took gold, with Finland’s Matti Suur-Hamari second. The 32-year-old Hill was making his Paralympics debut, having joined the ParalympicsGB programme in summer 2020 after a below-the-knee leg amputation after a car crash in December 2018. His teammate Owen Pick, who lost his right leg serving in Afghanistan in 2010, just missed out on a historic second British medal, finishing in fourth place in the same event. After the race Hill told Channel 4: “I didn’t think banked slalom was going to be my thing. It’s my third ever banked slalom.” He won a bronze medal in the same event in the World Championships in Lillehammer in 2021, and added that after that result, where he felt he had made a mistake right at the end of his run, he “kind of thought that there was a little chance in the back pocket that I could pull something out here”. That gold for Sun Qi was accompanied by a victory for Wu Zhongwei in the men’s banked slalom SB-LL1 on another highly successful day for the hosts. In the two other snowboarding classes contested on Friday, Chinese athletes filled out the podium with silvers and bronzes. The women’s banked slalom SB-LL2 went to Brenna Huckaby of the US, while France’s Maxime Montaggioni won the men’s banked slalom SB-UL In the para Alpine skiing, the women’s visually impaired giant slalom was a family affair for Austria’s Aigner sisters. Veronika Aigner comfortably won the gold by a margin of more than seven seconds from China’s Zhu Daqing. In bronze medal position was Veronika’s 16-year-old sister Barbara Aigner. If two medals in one event for the Aigner family wasn’t enough, Veronika Aigner is guided by her elder sister Elisabeth Aigner – and Barbara Aigner is the twin sister of Johannes Aigner, who has taken the men’s events by storm. Between them the family now have six medals to take home from Beijing. Millie Knight of ParalympicsGB finished ninth, describing Friday’s run as “really good fun”, and Britain’s Menna Fitzpatrick finished seventh. Fitzpatrick had enough breath left after her second run to wish her parents a happy wedding anniversary into the camera. She would normally have been able to do that in person, as athletes would usually be accompanied to the Winter Paralympics by friends and family, but the Beijing “closed loop” system to mitigate against Covid-19 means attendance in China is severely restricted. Those precautions may yet prevent Steve Arnold from competing for Great Britain. His journey to China was delayed by a pre-departure positive Covid test, and ParalympicsGB have confirmed he has tested positive again on arrival. He awaits the results of further tests with just two days of Nordic skiing competition remaining. Back on the slopes, China’s Zhang Mengqiu claimed a second gold of the Games with victory in the women’s giant slalom standing. Sweden’s Ebba Årsjö had been in contention, only 0.07sec slower than Zhang in the first run, but she suffered a bad crash on her second run, which led to a course hold while she received medical attention. Mollie Jepsen of Canada ended up with silver, with Germany’s Andrea Rothfuss third. Momoka Muraoka of Japan won her third gold of these Games in the women’s giant slalom sitting, ending up with a 7.28sec advantage over China’s Liu Sitong in second place. At the National Biathlon Center in Zhangjiakou, the Ukraine-born Oksana Masters now has two golds and three silvers from these Games after finishing ahead of teammate Kendall Gretsch in the women’s individual sitting biathlon race. Masters finished in 42:17.09 despite missing a shot, and in the end had a 5.8sec cushion over Gretsch. Liu Mengtao had a clear shooting round as he powered to another Chinese gold, finishing nearly 45 seconds ahead of Ukraine’s Taras Rad in the men’s event. Britain’s Scott Meenagh finished an impressive sixth. In the men’s individual standing biathlon, France’s Benjamin Daviet raced away with it, finishing more than two minutes ahead of Canada’s Mark Arendz in silver and four minutes ahead of the bronze medallist, Grygorii Vovchynskyi from Ukraine. In the women’s individual standing biathlon there was silver for China’s Zhao Zhiqing and bronze for Canada’s Brittany Hudak, but the gold went to Ukraine, with Liudmyla Liashenko leading from start to finish, and winning by 44.3sec despite picking up two shooting penalties. Oleksandr Kazik added a ninth Ukrainian gold of these Games with victory in the men’s visually impaired biathlon, with his compatriot Vitaliy Lukianenko in second. That result came moments after Oksana Shyshkova had secured gold for Ukraine in the women’s event in a tight finish, just 3.6 seconds ahead of Germany’s Linn Kazmaier. Sadly Carina Edlinger of Austria did not finish the race in the women’s visually impaired biathlon, and so there was to be no repeat of the scenes when her guide dog Riley stole the show while she was receiving her gold medal for the women’s sprint event on Wednesday. Edlinger has said Riley has become “more famous than the Chinese President” in the Paralympics Village, and that “even when you have a bad day, your dog still comes to you and wants to have a cuddle. He is worth more than gold”. The 2018 silver-medallists Canada booked their expected place in the final of the para ice hockey competition with an emphatic 11-0 victory over South Korea. The South Koreans must be absolutely sick of the sight of the Canadians, who also beat them 6-0 in the preliminary stages. The gold medal match is scheduled for Sunday, and Canada will most likely face reigning champions the US, who play China in the other semi-final late on Friday.",Sport/Sport,Winter paralympics 2022: historic bronze for GB snowboarder Ollie Hill,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/11/winter-paralympics-2022-historic-bronze-for-gb-snowboarder-ollie-hill
3/11/2022,"The likelihood of a criminal investigation and charges against Donald Trump are rising due to allegations by a House panel of a “criminal conspiracy” involving his aggressive drive to overturn the 2020 election results, coupled with a justice department (DoJ) inquiry of a “false electors” scheme Trump loyalists devised to block Joe Biden’s election. Former federal prosecutors say evidence is mounting of criminal conduct by Trump that may yield charges against the ex- president for obstructing an official proceeding of Congress on 6 January or defrauding the US government, stemming from his weeks-long drive with top allies to thwart Biden’s election by pushing false claims of fraud. A 2 March court filing by the House January 6 panel implicated Trump in a “criminal conspiracy” to block Congress from certifying Biden’s win, and Trump faces legal threats from justice department investigations under way into a “false electors” ploy, and seditious conspiracy charges filed against Oath Keepers who attacked the Capitol, say department veterans. The filing by the House panel investigating the 6 January assault on the Capitol by a mob of pro-Trump supporters stated that it has “a good-faith basis for concluding that the president and members of his campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States”. The panel’s hard-hitting findings about Trump’s criminal schemes were contained in a federal court filing involving top Trump lawyer John Eastman, who has fought on attorney client privilege grounds turning over a large cache of documents including emails sought by the committee. Back in January, the deputy attorney general, Lisa Monaco, also revealed a criminal investigation was being launched into a far reaching scheme in seven states that Biden won which was reportedly overseen by Trump’s ex-lawyer Rudy Giuliani to replace legitimate electors with false ones pledged to Trump. But the House panel’s blockbuster allegations that Trump broke laws to overturn the election have prompted some ex-prosecutors to call on the justice department to quickly accelerate its investigations to focus on the multiple avenues that Trump used to nullify the election results in tandem with top allies like Giuliani. “The compelling evidence of criminal activity by Trump revealed by the committee in its recent 61-page court filing should spur DoJ to act expeditiously,” Paul Pelletier, a former acting chief of DoJ’s fraud section, told the Guardian. “Given the gravity of the revelations, the department should consider a strike force or even a special counsel to coalesce sufficient resources to focus on these criminal attacks that strike at the heart of our democracy,” Pelletier added. “There is no time to waste now that the House committee has provided the clearest view yet into how Trump and his campaign apparently schemed to upend our democracy.” Other ex-prosecutors say the House panel and the justice department seem poised to increase legal heat on Trump. “A pincer-movement is emerging in the January 6 investigations of those who conspired to overturn the election,” said Dennis Aftergut, a former federal prosecutor. “The justice department and the House select committee investigating the Capitol siege have turned up the heat on Trump’s inner circle that could ensnare Trump himself.” Trump and his lawyers have fought unsuccessfully to keep White House records from the panel on executive privilege grounds, and Trump last month sparked strong criticism by calling for massive protests in DC, Atlanta and New York if “vicious” and “racist” prosecutors in those cities probing his political and business activities “do anything illegal”. Former prosecutors note that the justice department has at least two key criminal investigations under way that could be instrumental in bringing criminal charges against Trump himself. The criminal inquiry into “false electors” came after referrals by state attorneys general in Michigan and New Mexico where phony slates of electors were assembled with help from the Trump campaign and key loyalists like Giuliani who has also been subpoenaed by the House panel to testify and provide documents. In addition, the department announced this month it struck a plea deal with one of about a dozen Oath Keepers who had been charged with seditious conspiracy for the attack on Congress on 6 January aimed at disrupting Biden’s certification. Further in another legal track threatening Trump, a special grand jury in Georgia has been convened by the Fulton county district attorney to investigate Trump’s high-pressure call to the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, on 2 January urging him to “find” 11,780 votes to overturn Biden’s win in the state. These federal and state investigations could gain momentum given the House panel’s allegations that Trump and his campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy to block Biden from taking office. Some ex-prosecutors say the panel’s detailed allegations could lead to a criminal referral to the justice department that prosecutors would probably examine seriously. “The committee’s sworn, evidence-based allegation that former president Trump conspired to overturn the election sends an unmistakable message,” Aftergut said. “The train heading toward a criminal referral to the DoJ is leaving the station.” Aftergut in a 9 March Washington Post op-ed co written with Harvard Law professor Laurence Tribe called for the attorney general, Merrick Garland, to name a special counsel to lead a Trump related-investigation as the best way to reassure the country that “justice is non-partisan, and fears of political fallout will not determine the decision on whether to bring charges”. Other former prosecutors say the House panel’s 2 March evidence that Trump broke laws in a criminal conspiracy, coupled with the justice department investigations that are moving forward, could fuel criminal charges against Trump and his top allies. “The seditious conspiracy charges and the newly announced investigation of fake electors indicate that the government is increasingly investigating more serious and significant charges above and beyond the violent events of the day,” said Paul Rosenzweig, a former federal prosecutor who worked on Ken Starr’s team during the impeachment of Bill Clinton. “These developments, along with the ongoing investigation of Trump confidants like Rudy Giuliani, suggest that more charges are likely,” Rosenzweig added. “I assume that as part of the ongoing investigation into January 6, the department already has a dedicated task force looking into potential criminal charges against Trump and his top loyalists. If they do not, they should.” Aftergut said that the House panel had amassed substantial evidence that should benefit prosecutors investigating criminal charges against Trump. “In the course of interviewing more than 600 witnesses, the committee has developed a mountain of evidence that could greatly enhance prosecutors’ efforts,” he said.",News/US news,"Likelihood of criminal charges against Trump rising, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/11/donald-trump-criminal-charges-capitol-attack-house-panel
