2/12/2022,"You could hear this match between Ireland and France coming way back in the autumn. The anticipation has been building like a drum fill since the two teams beat New Zealand on back-to-back Saturdays last November. Right now, the world rankings will tell you that Ireland are the best team in Europe. The French, who were, after all, the last team to beat Ireland when they won 15-13 in Dublin last year, believe differently. They are playing to settle that, the shot at the grand slam, and something more, too. The winner will step forward full of confidence that they can beat the best teams in the biggest games, with the ringing conviction that they are the top team.  The loser will have to live with the knowledge that they came up short when it counted most, and deal with the doubt that follows a step backwards. At the start of the week, you could have made a case that the Irish were just about favourites, even though they are going away from home. They had played pitilessly well against Wales last Saturday, while France had had a harder time getting past Italy a day later. And then the news broke that Johnny Sexton had strained a hamstring and would miss this game. In a match as finely poised as this, that was enough, all of a sudden, to tilt the balance back the other way. “That’s sport,” said Ireland’s head coach, Andy Farrell. His team had trained for this, rehearsed it in practice, swapping Sexton and his replacement Joey Carbery in and out for the last three weeks. The game’s never just about one man, Farrell said, and he’s right. His Ireland team have grown over the last year, winning nine games on the bounce, and don’t depend on Sexton like they used to. But it’s true, too, that some players are easier to do without than others, and Sexton, the man who won the game with a 45-metre drop-goal the last time Ireland won in Paris, is about the last one Farrell would want to lose. For Ireland, then, the game has become a different sort of test. The question in front of them now is how they’ll go without their captain and playmaker, and whether Carbery, who has played so well off the bench since he made his debut in 2016, is the man to take over when Sexton has finally gone for good. It’s an issue they have been worrying about on and off for the last few years. It even came up in the last World Cup, when Sexton was forced out of Ireland’s pool match against Japan with a thigh injury. On that occasion, Farrell’s predecessor Joe Schmidt picked Jack Carty to start, and put Carbery on the bench. Ireland lost 19-12. This time, Farrell has them the other way round. Even so, the Irish have been talking a good game. The players and coaches have sounded calm and confident all week. “We’re very clear on where we’re sitting at the moment, how we’ve developed our game, how we’re playing the game,” says the scrum coach John Fogarty. “We’ve played France twice in the last two years, when we came here last time out we didn’t feel as ready as we do now.” They sound like a team who know exactly how they want to win. “There’s going to be times when we have to muscle up, but in general we want to be on our feet, we don’t want to be on the ground, and we don’t want to be clustered in any parts of the field. Hopefully we can spend more time playing the game than in an arm-wrestle.” The question is how well that plan holds up when the French bring the hammer down on it. Their head coach, Fabien Galthié, has brought the burly François Cros into the back row to bolster his monumental pack, and loaded his bench with six forwards too. They’ll look to soften Ireland up, and then strike. The chances are there will be a moment in there, somewhere, when it’s all Ireland can do to stay in the game. Farrell knows it, and has tried to prepare his team for it. “There’s no doubt that France are going to have a purple patch, it’s an absolute given,” Farrell says, “How we get back on task is going to be key for both sides, no doubt about that.” If they can hold on through that stretch, then the game may come down to the replacements. It’s a sign of just how strong this Ireland squad is that they have five British and Irish Lions on the bench. If the match is still in the balance at that point, it might be the young French side who start to feel the pressure. As Galthié put it, in his own inimitable way, “we are touching the summit of European rugby, the sublime side of the European game.” Which, if you need the translation, is his way of saying it’s going to be a hell of a match.",Sport/Sport,Ireland look to Joey Carbery to step up in finely poised match with France,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/12/ireland-look-to-joey-carbery-to-step-up-in-finely-poised-match-with-france
2/12/2022,"“You sure know the way to a Polynesian’s heart” said Olsen Filipaina, eyeing a large pile of grilled Greek lamb chops. I had finally enticed the legend of Australian and New Zealand rugby league to commit to a story about his life for the Guardian Australia in their “Forgotten” story section. “Why would anybody be interested after 35 years?” So the journey began. It turns out that a lot of fans are still interested in a cult hero who became one of the most lovable figures in rugby league. However, beyond the stories and statistics lies an impact and legacy still felt today as the “Pacific Revolution” culturally disrupts rugby league across the world. Today the NRL boasts 46% of its players with Pasifika/Māori background.  Olsen played 29 Tests and 50 total games for New Zealand and over 100 first grade games for the Balmain Tigers, Eastern Suburbs Roosters and North Sydney Bears. Yet pioneers have different metrics beyond cold statistics: soft measures matter like inspiration, role modelling, resilience and restraint. He was born on 23 April 1957, under a cabbage tree in the small village of Awarua, near Kaikohe. His mother, Sissie, was his guiding light, and she was a tough, proud and compassionate Māori woman of the Ngāpuhi nation north of New Zealand. His father was a tough Samoan boxer who migrated to Auckland, a pioneer of the mass migration of Polynesians into New Zealand. The Filipaina family moved to Auckland when Olsen was five and he gravitated from dominating bullrush to terrorising opponents in Auckland rugby league. His heady mix of brute strength and silky skills turned his beloved Mangere East Hawks into a contender and at 20 made his debut for the Kiwis. At 23, at the urging of his mother he signed with the Balmain Tigers and began his journey. There had been a smattering of Pasifika/Māori players in the NSWRL but Olsen was the first to carry the burden of expectation. His form fluctuated in Sydney and he was dropped a number of times for non-performance related issues. Playing in the NSWRL, a new monocultural world hostile to outsiders, he promised his mother that regardless of the physical or verbal abuse he received, he would never use his fists to fight back and give Pasifika/Māori a bad name. Olsen was a confidence player who needed coaches to love him and, without that key relationship in place, he suffered from homesickness, depression and was particularly affected by racism. There were many months when his phone bill to his mother in New Zealand exceeded his combined salary as a ‘garbo’ and a rugby league player. He received the aroha/love he needed from revolutionary Kiwis coach Sir Graham Lowe and rewarded Lowe’s cultural competence with a dominant Player of the Series display for the Kiwis in the 1985 test matches against the Kangaroos billed as “the world championship”. To achieve this on a losing team is a major achievement. To do so facing Wally Lewis, who had the year before won the inaugural Golden Boot award for the best player in the world, was a shock to rugby league’s cosmic order. “The influence, domination and magic of Polynesian players in the NRL was created by Olsen,” Lowe reflected. “He knew what would follow him .” Olsen’s influence went beyond rugby league. As the first Pasifika superhero his inspirational feats were celebrated across the sporting divides. For former All Black Eroni Clarke, Olsen was the chosen one: “We talk about how we as Pacific people navigated the oceans of the Pacific by just using stars. Olsen was like those stars for us; he dared to open the pathway. Olsen gave us permission to dream, express our talent and individuality without conforming and he gifted us a map to navigate through.” Wally Lewis, an NRL Immortal considered one of the greatest players of all time, recalls Olsen’s impact: “The Kiwis were desperate to increase their standings in the international rankings … and thanks to his injection, New Zealand immediately became almost unbeatable on the international stage. He was an instant inspiration to teammates and fans, but Olsen was so humble he rarely sought credit … He was a wonderful player, but an even better bloke.” Olsen was also a man of principle. He refused to accept his prestigious Hall of Fame, Legends of League induction unless family were allowed into the event having driven for four hours to pay tribute to their relative. And when he was asked to captain Samoa late in his career, Olsen accepted on the strict condition that 50% of the players be local based Samoans to help the development of the local game. As the Māori All Stars honour the memory of Olsen Filipaina in the 2022 Indigenous All Stars match, they will know that they are paying respect to a key person in their rugby league whakapapa (lineage). John Devonshire, chair of Māori Rugby League calls Olsen: “A man with humility and humour and whose playing skills spoke for themselves’ “He was the flagship for the Māori and Polynesian pathway and most importantly he has unquestionable mana – his respect, his stature and his reason for being.” Patrick Skene is the author of The Big O: The Life and Times of Olsen Filipaina - Pacific Revolution Pioneer, available in bookstores. @patrick_skene",Sport/Sport,"‘He gifted us a map’: game to farewell Olsen Filipaina, first star of NRL’s Pacific revolution",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/12/he-gifted-us-a-map-game-to-farewell-olsen-filipaina-first-star-of-nrls-pacific-revolution
2/12/2022,"The Morrison government has faced one of the biggest parliamentary revolts in decades. Five Liberal MPs crossed the floor to pass Labor amendments to the government’s religious discrimination bill in the early hours of Thursday. The last time any Australian government faced a revolt of this magnitude was when six Coalition senators crossed the floor in November 1982 to support a Labor bill to curtail the power of the Senate to bring down governments by blocking or threatening to block supply.  Crossing the floor is rare, and only seems to be getting rarer, with a minority of federal politicians having ever crossed the floor and just a single politician involved in more than half of all floor crossing divisions between 1950 and 2019, according to data compiled by the parliamentary library. Large defections have scuttled significant legislation before. In 2006, then prime minister John Howard was forced to drop a bill that aimed to send asylum seekers who arrived by boat to Nauru for processing. Despite three lower house MPs crossing the floor against the bill, with one abstaining, the bill made it to the Senate. But Howard was unable to secure a majority in the Senate despite the government having a slim majority of 39 (out of 76) Senate seats. At the time, Liberal senator Judith Troeth had vowed to cross the floor against the legislation, and Nationals senator Barnaby Joyce said he planned to abstain from the vote. Troeth would also later cross the floor with senator Susan Boyce to vote in favour of Labor’s carbon pollution reduction scheme. In 1994, six Coalition senators – three Liberals and three Nationals – crossed the floor to vote against legislation introduced by the Labor government, and supported by the Coalition, which would override Tasmania’s anti-gay laws. Four Coalition MPs had also crossed the floor in the lower house against the bill. The legislation still passed, legalising sex between consenting adults in Australia and eventually leading to Tasmania repealing its anti-gay laws. The vast majority of floor crossings happened in the middle of last century according to parliamentary library data, with more than 160 floor crossing divisions by Coalition members while Sir Robert Menzies was prime minister. Malcolm Fraser also saw more than 100 floor crossing divisions while prime minister. But in the past few decades the numbers have dropped off. There were just over 35 floor crossings by Coalition members while John Howard was prime minister between 1996 and 2007. Malcolm Turnbull’s tenure saw 15 but there were just three under Tony Abbott. The Labor party had just 29 individuals cross the floor between 1950 and 2019, according to the parliamentary library. Members of the Coalition tend to cross the floor more often when they are in government than when in opposition. The reverse tends to hold for Labor. Although the Labor party has only been in government for six years in the past thirty, and has seen far fewer floor crossings in total. The Labor party has strict rules against crossing the floor, with members expected to vote with the party or face potential expulsion. The Liberal and National parties do not enforce voting as strictly. Data from They Vote For You shows that there were no floor crossings in 2019, one in 2020 and 35 in 2021. But these counts include conscience votes, where parties allow members to vote freely. Only a minority of MPs ever cross the floor against their party. Since the 50s less than 30% of all members of parliament have ever crossed the floor. The percentage is slightly higher for senators than it is for members of the House of Representatives.",News/News,Religious discrimination revolt: crossing the floor big under Menzies but increasingly rare,https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2022/feb/12/religious-discrimination-revolt-crossing-the-floor-big-under-menzies-but-increasingly-rare
