1/9/2022,"The Observer and Guardian journalist Carole Cadwalladr will appear in court in London next Friday to defend herself against an accusation of defamation brought by Arron Banks, the multi-millionaire businessman and outspoken backer of Brexit. The case concerns a remark made in a talk at the Ted technology conference by Cadwalladr in April 2019, and a related tweet. In the widely viewed 15-minute talk about the pernicious effects of Facebook on the democratic electoral process, Cadwalladr spoke about the 2016 Brexit referendum and noted briefly that Nigel Farage’s Leave.EU campaign, largely funded by £8m from Banks, the largest donation in British political history, had been found by the Electoral Commission to have broken electoral and data laws.  In two sentences Cadwalladr also noted the commission’s investigation into the source of Banks’s funding, and made a passing reference to the financier “telling lies” about what she called “his covert relationship with the Russian government”. A couple of months later, after Banks had complained about the Ted talk reference, she tweeted a further reference to Banks “lying” about his contact with the Russian government. Banks, who was subsequently cleared of criminality in relation to the donation, after an investigation by the National Crime Agency, and who has always strongly denied any illegal Russian links – although he admits meeting Russian embassy officials on a number of occasions – has been pursuing the case against Cadwalladr for more than two years. In a preliminary ruling in November 2019 on the meaning of Cadwalladr’s words in the talk and tweet, Mr Justice Saini concluded that an average listener would have understood that: “On more than one occasion Mr Banks told untruths about a secret relationship he had with the Russian government in relation to acceptance of foreign funding of electoral campaigns in breach of the law on such funding.” Banks, in his legal claim, says this meaning is defamatory of him. Cadwalladr has said this is not the meaning she intended and that she had always been careful to say there was no evidence to suggest Banks had accepted any money. Although she initially defended the claim on the basis of truth, limitation and the public interest, the defences of truth and limitation were withdrawn after Mr Justice Saini set out the meanings which he had found the Ted talk and the tweet to bear. Cadwalladr is now defending the claim against her on the basis that her reporting was in the public interest. Cadwalladr, who has won numerous awards for her investigative reporting into the effects of big data and social media on the Brexit campaign and the election of Donald Trump, reporting which led directly to the American Federal Trade Commission imposing a record $5bn fine on Facebook, has spent much of the past two years trying to work with the threat of Banks’s suit hanging over her. If Banks wins the case, Cadwalladr may be personally liable for his costs, estimated at between £750,000 and £1m, together with any resultant damages. The case has been monitored closely by several British investigative reporters, some of whom have had their own libel litigation problems. There has also been support for Cadwalladr from a number of press freedom groups, concerned about what they see as the potentially chilling effect of a rich individual with a high public profile like Banks being able to sue Cadwalladr, a freelance journalist, in person, but not suing the Ted organisation, which provided the platform for her talk, and on whose website it can still be viewed. When Banks first brought his case against Cadwalladr, seven press freedom groups, among them Reporters Without Borders and Index On Censorship, called for the case to be thrown out and for the British government to defend public-interest journalism. Their open letter described the case as bearing many of the hallmarks of a so-called Slapp suit – strategic lawsuits against public participation – in which legal action will inevitably be expensive and time consuming for journalists to resist. Paul Webster, editor of the Observer, said: “Carole’s brave reporting has given the public deep insight into the secretive ways powerful people, organisations and social media companies have sought to influence our democracies and the hidden role played by technology in using our data and shaping our politics. “We will continue to support the rights of journalists like Carole to report independently and in the public interest.”",News/Politics,Guardian’s Cadwalladr in court to fight defamation claim by Brexit backer Banks,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/08/guardians-carole-cadwalladr-in-court-to-fight-defamation-claim-by-brexit-backer-arron-banks
1/9/2022,"The emergence of Omicron could be the “first ray of light” towards living with Covid as an endemic disease, according to a government scientific adviser. Dr Mike Tildesley, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M) and a University of Warwick professor, said Omicron could be an indicator that in the future there may be a less severe variant that is similar to the common cold. But as Covid cases continued to rise in the UK and hospitalisations at their highest in almost a year, he said “we’re not quite there yet”.  “The thing that might happen in the future is you may see the emergence of a new variant that is less severe, and ultimately, in the long term, what happens is Covid becomes endemic and you have a less severe version. It’s very similar to the common cold that we’ve lived with for many years,” he told Times Radio on Saturday. “We’re not quite there yet, but possibly Omicron is the first ray of light there that suggests that may happen in the longer term. It is, of course, much more transmissible than Delta was, which is concerning, but much less severe.” He added: “Hopefully, as we move more towards the spring and we see the back of Omicron, we can get more inter-relationships of living with Covid as an endemic disease and protecting the vulnerable. Any variant that does emerge which is less severe, ultimately, in the longer term, is where we want to be.” A total of 18,454 people were in hospital with coronavirus on 6 January, according to government figures. This marks a 40% week-on-week rise and the highest number since 18 February. Middlesbrough, Copeland and Redcar and Cleveland had among the UK’s highest week-on-week rises in Covid cases, while in London they were thought to be slowing down. Tildesley said rises in hospital admissions in the north-east, north-west and the Midlands were “concerning” and that most parts of the country were approximately two to three weeks behind London. “On the slightly more positive side, so it doesn’t sound all doom and gloom, what we are seeing from hospital admissions is that stays in hospital do appear to be on average shorter, which is good news, symptoms appear to be a little bit milder, so this is what we are seeing consistently with the Omicron variant,” he added. According to NHS England data, 39,142 NHS staff at hospital trusts in England were absent due to Covid on 2 January – a 59% rise on the previous week and more than triple the number at the beginning of December. The Health Service Journal estimated that staff absences across the whole of the NHS for all reasons, including Covid, could be as high as 120,000. Around 9,300 armed forces are available on standby. Meanwhile, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has advised against giving a second booster, or a fourth dose, of the vaccine to care home residents and people aged 80-plus after figures showed it was 90% effective at preventing hospital admission. Instead, experts want to prioritise the rollout of the first booster dose and encourage those who are still unvaccinated to have first and second doses. To date, more than 51 million people have had a first dose and over 47 million have had a second dose. More than 35 million have had a booster or third dose.",News/World news,"Omicron shows Covid may become more like common cold, says UK expert",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/08/omicron-shows-covid-may-become-more-like-common-cold-says-uk-expert
1/9/2022,"If not for the freshly plastered graffiti over its walls informing passers-by of the dozens of detained refugees inside, the Park hotel looks like it could be any regular building in Melbourne. It exists in a particularly pleasant part of the world, just north of Melbourne’s central business district, right in the shadow of the city’s university and surrounded by a parade of enticing Asian restaurants. The building, meanwhile, is coloured in nondescript shades of cream and grey. In regular times, people rarely look twice. Since Novak Djokovic arrived in Melbourne and was promptly ordered by the Australian Border Force to leave the country before being whisked away to the detention hotel as his lawyers appealed the cancellation of his visa, the Park hotel has been at the epicentre of one of the most absurd sporting stories in recent memory. As Djokovic’s fans gathered, so too did those campaigning for the freedom of the refugees, some of whom have been there for years.  On Monday, one way or another, those sights will be no more. Djokovic’s legal battle against his deportation from Australia began on Thursday as his lawyers secured an interim injunction for him to remain in the country until after his hearing, which the government did not oppose. That hearing begins on Monday at 10am. Despite the spectacle, the facts are simple. Upon Djokovic’s arrival in Melbourne on Wednesday night, the Australian Border Force found that he was unable to prove that he met Australia’s entry requirements, which requires arrivals to be vaccinated. As an unvaccinated traveller, Djokovic had been granted a medical exemption through a process directed by Tennis Australia and the state of Victoria in order to compete in the Australian Open, but the federal government, and no other entity, controls the country’s borders. Thus, Djokovic’s legal team will have to prove that the border force’s decision to cancel his visa and move to deport him was unlawful. On Saturday, court documents revealed that Djokovic sought his medical exemption after, his lawyers say, he was infected with Covid-19 on 16 December. His lawyers also cite his travel declaration and exemption as indication that he was entitled to enter Victoria Of the possible outcomes, Djokovic could win the case, allowing him to leave the hotel and compete, or he could lose it and be forced to depart the country. The case could rumble on, with his presence and freedom in Melbourne at the discretion of the judge. The hearing is set to be a spectacle itself:it will be held on Microsoft Teams and be open to the public. The federal court’s website has published the link to Monday’s hearing, along with the warning in bold letters: “It is imperative that you keep your camera and audio off as this can affect the progress of the hearing.” In the wake of so much public emotion, outrage and attention, that may be the entire goal for some. From a sporting perspective, the stakes are clear. Djokovic has already fumbled one major championship recently when he was defaulted from the fourth round of the 2020 US Open after accidentally hitting a lineswoman with a ball. He does not need to do so again. Even though Djokovic remains the dominant player in men’s tennis, having stood one match from winning the grand slam last year, and will have other opportunities, every major tournament counts when you are 34 years old. He had arrived in Melbourne seeking a record-breaking 21st major singles title. Should he lose the case, there are further concerns. If the cancellation of Djokovic’s visa is upheld, he could be banned from re-entering the country for three years. It remains to be seen whether he would even want to return to Australia after how things have panned out. His cause has found support in unlikely corners. “It’s just too much at this point,” said Australian tennis player Nick Kyrgios on Saturday. “Honestly, I hope it all gets sorted as soon as possible. For the sport we need him here, it’s that simple. He’s one of the most influential sports people probably of all time.” On Saturday morning, after some rowdy days and nights, the hotel’s surroundings were far quieter. A couple of Serbian fans of Djokovic, a father and son, quietly scanned the building across the road. Meanwhile, a dozen tenacious human rights protesters continued to brandish their signs demanding the immediate release of the refugees. Policemen and policewomen stood guard, while photographers congregated around windows, their cameras clicking every time a curtain moved. Occasionally, members of the public would pass by and stop to take a look. Karen and Patrick were on their way to the neighbourhood of Brunswick, minding their business on a route they had taken countless times in their lives, when they stumbled across the scene. “We walked past this building so many times not knowing that they’ve been there for months,” said Karen. When Djokovic departs , so too will the cameras that had only briefly focused on the plight of the refugees. One activist, Asher, stood to the southern side of the building with a bright pink sign that read: “Aussie Open? More like Aussie endlessly abusing refugees,” a real tennis racket attached to each corner of the sign. His frustration was clear: “I’m kind of disgusted that it’s taken Djokovic being put in here for attention to come to these men,” Asher said. “Djokovic will be here for a few days and he’s not in the same situation at all. The media should be caring about these men – regardless of Djokovic.”",Sport/Sport,How the Novak Djokovic row brought the world’s attention to a drab refugee hotel,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/08/how-the-novak-djokovic-row-brought-the-worlds-attention-to-a-drab-refugee-hotel
1/9/2022,"The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, has questioned the BBC’s complaints process in an escalating row over the broadcaster’s reporting of an antisemitic attack in London. In a letter to Tim Davie, the BBC’s director general, seen by the Guardian, Dorries asked him to explain how the corporation has responded to concerns from Jewish leaders over its coverage of an incident in November on Oxford Street and how he plans to “resolve the issue in a suitably timely manner”.  She added: “You will know my concerns about the speed of the process which I asked officials to communicate to the BBC earlier this week.” In the letter, she suggested that the BBC’s handling of the issue raised questions over whether it handled audience complaints in a “fair and effective” way. “It is crucial that the BBC can be properly held to account for the fulfilment of its Mission and Public Purposes as set out in the Charter, including through a fair and effective complaints process,” she wrote. “I expect the Mid-Term Review of the BBC Charter to consider whether this is currently the case.” Ofcom, the communications regulator, said it has written to the BBC to request information but that it could not comment further at this stage. The Times reported that during the attack, Jewish passengers on a bus were abused by a group of men. The BBC website published a story in which it said that “a slur about Muslims” had been heard from inside the bus, a claim that was also broadcast by BBC London. The newspaper reports that it was later discovered BBC editors thought the words “dirty Muslims” had been used. However, the Board of Deputies of British Jews, which has reportedly commissioned two independent reviews of audio from the incident, concluded that the phrase was in fact “tikrah lemishu, ze dachuf”, meaning “call someone, it’s urgent” in Hebrew. Marie van der Zyl, president of the board, wrote to Davie last month, copying in Dorries. The BBC said the audio had been checked by “a number of Hebrew speakers”, reports the Times. The BBC told the Guardian: “Antisemitism is abhorrent. We strive to serve the Jewish community, and all communities across our country, fairly. As we have stated previously, our story was a factual report that overwhelmingly focused on the individuals the police want to identify; those who directed abuse at the bus. “We know that there are some strong views about this report. We take complaints very seriously and they are being taken through our complaints process. Tim Davie has instructed that this process is accelerated to the executive complaints unit which is editorially independent from news and will ensure complaints are fully responded to as swiftly as possible.”",News/Media,Nadine Dorries grills BBC over coverage of antisemitic attack story,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/08/nadine-dorries-grills-bbc-over-coverage-of-antisemitic-attack-story
1/9/2022,"“People talk about stress as something we have to learn to live with, particularly anxiety,” she says. “Actually we can do something about stress.” She believes we need to change our mindset around what she sees as one of the greatest causes of suffering today. There is no such thing as “good stress”, she says. “People are tired, exhausted and stressed. And they compensate for that by all sorts of behaviours and habits. I want to bring us into a normal state, a balanced state that is healthy.” Lavender is the least guru-like guru you could hope to meet. A Kiwi by birth, she talks in the no-nonsense style of the publishing CEO she was – “Rest is the funding mechanism for everything you do” – before discovering Vedic mediation in Sydney in her late-20s. In 2008, she set up the London and New York Meditation Centre with her American partner, Michael Miller, who she met on a retreat in India. The couple, now in their 50s, live in Notting Hill with their young daughter. They emit the sort of glow usually reserved for the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow. It’s not for nothing that they have built a following among burnt-out celebrities and stressed execs, with fees operating on a sliding scale from £400 to (you may need to sit quietly for a bit) £2,000 according to salary; their unwafty approach appealing to those who would run a square mile at the whiff of a joss stick.  “There’s nothing weird about us. We really love what we are doing. We are here to help people,” Lavender says. “It’s that simple.” Since the London Meditation Centre began, meditation has gone mainstream, with subscriptions to apps like Headspace and Calm soaring during the pandemic. Lavender wrote Why Meditate? in lockdown (ironically she had been too busy teaching people to meditate before). The book is her attempt to redress the “sloppiness” and misunderstandings surrounding meditation, to distinguish it from all the buzz around mindfulness. She also wanted to reach a wider audience, “to get the message out wide and far, and do it in a way that is honest and clear and accessible”. As she makes clear from the off, this book will not teach you to meditate. It is a why-to, not a how-to book – the clue is in the title. As anyone with a shelf-ful of unread meditation manuals will know, learning from a book is a non-starter (reading with your eyes closed can be tricky), and the prose style can usually be relied on to send you to sleep. We already know a lot of the Whys: meditation makes us happier, healthier and nicer to be around – broccoli for the brain. But Lavender follows the science to back it up: during meditation our metabolic rate drops far more quickly and deeply than in sleep, cortisol levels go down, serotonin levels rise. My favourite takeaway is that long-term meditators have been shown to have a biological age 12 years younger than their real one. Most of us are getting through the day on what she calls “excitation chemistry”, stress hormones, sugar, coffee and alcohol. “Life is hectic. There’s no question about that,” especially over the last few years. In her work, she sees the burden falling heaviest on women, mothers in particular, for whom each day is often a caffeine-fuelled race from the school run to the evening when you find yourself trying to open a bottle of wine with a bit of Lego. “People are recognising they need a counterbalance to all this.” I’ll drink to that. This is where Vedic meditation comes in, a mantra-based technique (very similar to transcendental meditation), which Lavender believes is nothing less than “an antidote to stress”. “Why is Vedic meditation so powerful?” she asks. “Because we de-excite so quickly, so efficiently and so deeply, much deeper than in a night’s sleep.” So what’s the catch? You can only learn it from a specially trained teacher, not a book or an app. As she says, you wouldn’t expect to learn to play the piano from watching YouTube videos. Students on Lavender’s most recent course included a nurse, a mother of three and a former venture capitalist. People come to mediate for many reasons. “It might be that they are not sleeping, that they want to get off medication, that they are going through a tough time and everything is upside down,” she says. “People are desperate for change. They are desperate to feel better. And they want to do that in a way that is natural.” Learning is “a really life-changing moment. I don’t say that lightly. I see it in every person that I teach.” Jo, a city lawyer and mother of two young girls in her mid-30s, learned to meditate with Lavender back in 2017. She had recently lost her father and was recovering from surgery for breast cancer. “I was absolutely wrecked. It would take me a few hours to get up and get dressed and start functioning properly,” she says. But when she started meditating she felt better almost immediately. “I was able to get up in the morning. It was just incredible.” Clara still meditates religiously every day, as it makes her feel more in control and that “nothing is impossible”. She has just sent a friend on a course who has recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. “People think it is going to be hard work. They say, ‘I couldn’t sit still,’ ‘I couldn’t silence my mind,’ ‘I don’t have time to meditate,’” Lavender says. “You can! If you are curious and are willing to sit down and follow instructions, you can do this!” Over the years I have held my breath in yoga studios all over London, chanted in a love circle on Ibiza and taken part in a moonlit meditation in the Austrian Alps (the moon was a no-show). And I subscribe to so many mindfulness apps my phone should be on permanent snooze. None of them have stuck. I still have the excitation levels of a small child at a birthday party which, as we all know, only ends in tears. And so I find myself on a late November afternoon in a chilly Unitarian Church in west London, sitting with my eyes closed with a room full of strangers wearing masks and woolly scarves. The course spans four days over a long weekend, each session no longer than two hours. It opens with a brief ceremony, which, as Miller informed us in the free introductory Zoom talk, “you will like if you like that sort of thing, and is very short if you don’t”. Nobody runs for the door. Then we get down to business, each of us called individually into an even chillier room, to be given our mantra, a meaningless sound, our key to Vedic meditation and lasting serenity. We are so far in now, we all return to our seats like children who have just met Santa. As Lavender promises, the instructions are few and seemingly straightforward. One of them is: “Don’t try.” As one of life’s pathological over-triers, this is up there with, “Don’t breathe.” And you must practise for 20 minutes twice a day – obviously, if anyone had 40 minutes to spare, they wouldn’t be here in the first place. But one of Lavender’s aims is to help people find ways to fit meditation into busy lives. If the nurse working 12-hour shifts is going to do it, then so can I. We begin to meditate. The first thing to say about Vedic mediation is that you do not have to stop your thoughts. Purifying my head is a bit like emptying out my handbag. The stuff that comes up (gritty lip balms, pebbles, headless toys) is messy, pointless and odd. I try not to try. Really hard. I repeat my mantra silently over and over. I’m not sure I’ve remembered it right. A few minutes in and my head starts moving weirdly, all on its own, like one of those nodding dogs you see in the back of car windows. All of the knotty bits in my neck and shoulders magically unravel. It must be working! I wonder if the same thing is happening to everyone else, if we are all sitting there swaying as if listening to music on invisible headphones. I don’t open my eyes. Then, eventually, there is a strange sort of quiet. Really, really quiet – like the floaty sensation before you come round from an anaesthetic. It works! Damn, the moment bursts like a bubble when you poke it. I leave the church feeling lighter, taller and more rested than I have for years – joyful, even. Later that evening a friend says I look well – official confirmation that I have indeed begun to glow. It is still early days, but I haven’t missed a session. My kids are delighted, not only because I am less shouty, but because they get 20 minutes TV before tea, when I sneak off for my afternoon meditation. It has become my secret superpower. That nice swimming feeling (and the nodding-head thing) comes more quickly and I get better at not chasing it away. I hope the benefits are incremental and by the time you read this, I will be well on my way to enlightenment – and a little younger, biologically speaking. If you are looking to “upgrade” – Lavender’s word – your life this year, you might start by doing nothing. Do Lavender and her partner ever have a moment over emptying the bins, or who has been putting in the most hours? Lavender hesitates. “No. There’s a kind of smoothness,” she admits. “We’ve both been meditating for a long time. Do I not get pissed off at some things? Sure. But not in a way that sticks.” And this is why she wants more people meditating: “Because I know the benefits of this for those individuals and I know the spreading effect that it has on families, on workplaces, on society,” she says. “It is why I do what I do.” Why Meditate?

1/9/2022,"Diane Kruger slapping Jessica Chastain across the face with a frozen fish should be funny. The scene, sadly not played for laughs, is one of many wasted opportunities in this lacklustre action thriller. Chastain’s Mace and Kruger’s Marie, along with Khadijah (Lupita Nyong’o) and Graciela (Penélope Cruz), are international spies who team up to retrieve a “deadly cybertool” that’s fallen into the wrong hands. Simon Kinberg’s film feels aggressively focus-grouped for the girl-boss crowd. “James Bond never had to deal with real life,” says mother-of-two Graciela with an eye roll. Winking dialogue about how women have been erased from history is similarly crowbarred in. Kruger smoulders as a German goth with daddy issues, and the only agent with any sort of swagger; Nyong’o, resplendent in a sweater vest, plays a tech specialist. Cruz is as luminous as ever, despite the fact that her role is mostly limited to crying and holding the phone. “We need another round… or like 10!” jokes Mace.

1/9/2022,"Not since Words With Friends, not since Draw Something, has an online game spread with such vigour. Wordle, a short, sweet word game in which the player has six attempts to guess a five-letter word, hangman-style, is everywhere, leaving green-and-yellow-spotted grids in its wake. It was created by software developer Josh Wardle, who wanted to come up with a game that his crossword-loving partner would enjoy playing during lockdown. Then he sent it to his family WhatsApp group and then he gave it to everyone. Like many, I fell for its charms last week. When it was released to the public in November, 90 people played it, but now hundreds of thousands are on it. I failed to get my first one – for some reason, I thought “tiler” was a better option than “tiger” – but I got the most recent in three tries.  I have placed a lot of hope in Wordle, which might seem disproportionate for a quick game, but hear me out. This is not an era in which good things are taken at face value. We are cynical, irritable and tired, and if there is a bad intention to be read into anything, someone will scratch away at it until they decide that they have found it. For now, Wordle seems to exist outside of that. A new puzzle appears just once a day. It doesn’t demand much time and in an attention economy built on the zombifying potential of an endless scroll or click, this seems like a generous gesture. The scarcity makes it more desirable: you can’t get tired of something so shy and retiring. The website is ad-free, there are no paid upgrades, no chance to reveal an extra letter by shelling out cash. When Wardle noticed that people liked to discuss their results, he added a function allowing them to share their grids, hence the green-and-yellow proliferating on social media like algae in a warm spell. That’s all there is to it. It is simple, fun, satisfying and free. Even its name, a nod to Wardle, is charming; even its origins – the New York Times has called it “a love story”, describing it as a lockdown gift from Wardle to his partner – are unbelievably sweet. I want to be uncynical about Wordle, I want to be unsuspicious, because right now, Wordle suggests that we can have nice things without breaking them. I got my BlackBerry for the Reading festival, somewhere around the mid-00s. Another writer, also there for the NME, had suggested that it would change the game: it meant no more running to a backstage cabin to hurriedly type up a review on a spare computer, if one was even spare; instead, you could just write as you watched, with frantic thumbs. It left more time for drinking pints from plastic cups and trying to get someone from Foals to pose for a photo with a fake moustache. (Reader, they declined.) Much like the Reading festival, I left the BlackBerry behind a long time ago, as a relic of youth. Soon after, the iPhone came along and swept away the BlackBerry’s practical good sense, the touchscreen temptress not great for typing anything at length, though in exchange it did offer the ability to pretend your fingers were riding a skateboard or playing a piano. With hindsight, that could be the moment it all started to go wrong. Nevertheless, the BlackBerry persisted. My favourite holdout was Kim Kardashian, who knows a thing or two about monetising platforms and perhaps knew something we did not. She tweeted her despair at the death of her BlackBerry Bold as late as 2016. But only last week, on 4 January 2022, after several spluttering death rattles and a number of false alarms, has the BlackBerry finally shuffled off this mortal coil, with the company ending support for its mobile devices, effectively killing off most of them. Is there a word for the specific wave of nostalgia that greets the demise of something that has long been obsolete? I have always maintained that The Golden Girls is muckier, funnier and more anarchic than most contemporary comedies could ever dream of being and I treasure my DVD box set as comfort watch, style inspiration and blueprint for getting older. What a treat, then, to witness people sharing their favourite Rose scenes online, after the death of Betty White, the last living Golden Girl, who died at the age of 99, a couple of weeks before her 100th birthday. Many of the tributes highlighted White’s impeccable comic timing. It can’t have been easy to play Rose, famously the ditsy one, against Blanche’s blowsy naughtiness, Dorothy’s dour wit or Sophia’s fabulously blunt ways, but White sailed through on comedy genius, her sweetness a perfect balance to all the acidity, one look from her enough to send the audience into raptures. You can’t help but wonder how White might have felt about People magazine’s latest issue, which went to print before the sad news broke, and hit newsstands with her face on the cover and the celebratory declaration, “Betty White Turns 100!” In a certain light, you could say it looks like one final punchline.

It’s basically a slightly different take on tech headlines and different things that are happening in the tech world, from two podcasters called Abadesi Osunsade and Michael Berhane. I used to physically go to events all the time, but now I don’t get to hear people’s perspectives about the things that are currently going on.

It’s about millennial life and this group of friends who have all these ups and downs in their careers, love lives and relationships.

Eat of Eden I don’t order out often, but when I do I like to support local spots. I’m vegan, so that cuts things down, but there’s still quite a richness in the options you can get. This is a place I order from all the time – it’s in Walthamstow, not far from me, although it turns out they have six branches across London. It’s proper comfort food – warming and filling. It’s Caribbean-inspired: they’ve got plantain, red rice, quinoa, patties, stews, salads, dumplings. I love the flavours and the fact that it’s healthy but also tastes amazing. King Richard (dir Reinaldo Marcus Green, 2021) I went to see this with my siblings last month. Serena and Venus [Williams] came up with the idea to do this movie about their dad and his role in their early lives, and it was a pretty cool film to watch with my own siblings – there are definitely parallels between their upbringing and ours. At a certain point he’s mad at them for being boastful, and he gets them to watch Cinderella, thinking there’s a lesson they’re going to learn in it. We were all laughing in the cinema, because it was the kind of thing my dad could have done. Meeting Owl I’m obsessed with this. It’s an owl-looking speaker; you put it in the middle of the room and it’s got a 360-degree camera and microphones and speakers. As a team, if we’re doing a hybrid meeting often it can be quite awkward to get everyone to hear everybody on both sides. But with the Meeting Owl, if someone starts talking it zooms in on them, or if two people talk at opposite ends of the owl there’s a split screen. It’s my new best friend and I’m having to hold myself back from taking it everywhere. Afrocenchix I wanted to highlight this as a cultural phenomenon: Afrocenchix are the ones who just had the first-ever afro hair Christmas advert, on Channel 4. It’s the brand of shampoo I use, and it’s been cool to be able to see the two founders take on the science of it all, build a brand, serve people and get mainstream coverage in such a short period of time. There’s genuine utility in it – the bottles are recyclable and everything they do is vegan and sustainable. I’m excited that they’ve started doing the shampoo in bigger bottles so I don’t need to buy it as often. Àsìkò Àsìkò is an artist whose work I love – I’ve got one up in my house. He’s a visual artist who works in photography, film and mixed media. He’s Nigerian but based in London, and his art is just beautiful; he is able to find the beauty in what could look quite mundane or ordinary. The piece I’ve got is called Edo, which are the marital beads you wear if you’re from Edo in Nigeria, which is where I’m from. He also does commissions; he did a pregnancy shoot for a friend of mine and she literally looks like a goddess.",Arts/Culture,On my radar: Anne-Marie Imafidon’s cultural highlights,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/08/on-my-radar-anne-marie-imafidons-cultural-highlights
1/9/2022,"At half-time Millwall’s supporters must have been convinced this was going to be their day. Leading in the south London derby thanks to a howler from the Crystal Palace goalkeeper Jack Butland, a famous FA Cup upset seemed very much on the cards. Unfortunately for them and their manager Gary Rowett, however, Michael Olise had different ideas. A sparkling 13 minute period at the start of the second half that saw him equalise, hit the post and then set up Jean-Philippe Mateta for what proved to be the winning goal was more evidence of the 20-year-old’s burgeoning talents.  Apart from reaching the quarter-finals under Roy Hodgson in 2019, Palace’s record in this competition has been awful since they came within nine minutes of beating Manchester United in the 2016 final, having been eliminated in the third round for the past two seasons. With that in mind, manager Patrick Vieira fulfilled his promise to select a strong side that featured the return of Conor Gallagher from injury and four other changes from the side beaten by West Ham last week. Since Palace’s last trip to the Den nearly nine years ago. Millwall have flirted with the top half of the Championship table but not quite managed to reach the play-offs despite a couple of close shaves. Their chances of reaching the top flight for the first time since 1990 were not helped by a run of three defeats in their last five league matches and this was a welcome opportunity to make a statement against their higher-ranked neighbours. While neither would describe each other as mortal enemies, there is certainly no love lost between clubs separated by just six miles and there was an intense atmosphere at kick-off. While Palace fans in the away end set off flares, there was widespread booing of those players who took the knee from all sections of the home support. Rowett remembered this week how he had been on the end of some real beatings against Vieira’s Arsenal during his playing days with Derby but his side clearly had a gameplan from the start here as they sprang out of the traps. Millwall should have gone ahead in the eighth minute when Benik Afobe blasted wide from close range but the former Arsenal striker would be handed another opportunity on a plate soon after. Quite what Butland was contemplating when he decided to take an extra touch under pressure from Tom Bradshaw only the goalkeeper will ever know and Afobe was a grateful recipient of his weak clearance. Had George Saville made the most of his chance inside the penalty area then it could have been much worse for the visitors. Palace did at least have a sight of goal when Jeffrey Schlupp forced George Long into a solid save midway through the half, before Gallagher was inches away from equalising from just outside the box. While Eberechi Eze – making his first start since returning from a lengthy injury layoff – also started to grow into the game against his former club, it was Vieira who headed down the tunnel feeling frustrated after Saville’s well-timed challenge on the Palace forward inside the area went unpunished. Whatever the Palace manager said during the break clearly had the desired effect. Barely 40 seconds of the second half had elapsed when Gallagher picked out Olise on the right and he unleashed a brilliant curling shot that went in off the far post. The 20-year-old was then inches away from doubling his tally six minutes later with a carbon copy, only for the ball to bounce off the post and away to safety this time. The loss of the influential Saville to injury suddenly meant Millwall were struggling to hang on as Olise again went close. But they could do nothing to stop him turning provider for Mateta as an inch-perfect cross picked out the unmarked Frenchman to complete the turnaround. Mateta’s reward for celebrating in front of the home fans was to be pelted with plastic bottles as several flares were set off by the Palace fans causing a delayed restart. Rowett abandoned his three-man defence and threw on Mason Bennett in a bid to find a way back into the tie. Substitute Matt Smith’s header in injury-time proved to be their big chance and it was gratefully grasped by Butland after his earlier error.",Sport/Football,Olise and Mateta ensure Crystal Palace avoid FA Cup exit after scare at Millwall,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/08/millwall-crystal-palace-fa-cup-match-report
1/9/2022,"Lisa Morrow has lived in the city since 2010 and blogs at Inside Out In Istanbul  The types of food available in Istanbul reflect its diverse population. Ficcin Erra Goppa, in the backstreets of the busy Taksim district, serves particularly good ficcin, a flat pastry meat pie from the Circassian territory – in northern Turkey on the other side of the Caspian Sea. For a heartier meal I usually head over to Siirt Şeref Büryan Kebap Salonu, near the Valens Aqueduct, across Haliç, (the Golden Horn) in Fatih. Named after Siirt, a city in south-east Turkey, it specialises in buryan kebab, mouth-watering lamb slow-cooked in a tandir (tandoor) oven. I’ll combine that with a plate of mumbar, lamb intestines stuffed with rice, parsley, onion and pepper. I love Istanbul’s waterways. I regularly catch the ferry up the Bosphorus to Emirgan to take in the air and art at Sakip Sabanci Museum. Turkish businessman Sabanci’s former family home now puts on a variety of local and international exhibitions. The large terrace overlooking the water is a great place to daydream. Or I’ll take a ferry along the Golden Horn to Eyüp. There I gaze at the stunningly beautiful tiles in the Eyüp Sultan mosque complex, sit for a while under centuries-old plane trees and then meander through elaborate Ottoman graveyards thinking about what I’m going to write next. The words Üsküdar and conservative often go hand-in-hand, but this mosque-filled neighbourhood offers a lot more. I marvel at the extraordinary glass dome roof in Nevmekan Sahil, a former registry office turned library. Lunch is at nearby Filizler Köftecisi. Its handmade köfte are extremely good, and the view from the first-floor tables is fabulous. Kiz Kulesi (the Maiden’s Tower) is directly opposite, and some days you see people swimming past. Afterwards, I go to Kadim Kahve for the thrill of drinking a coffee in a former hamam, then to Tabi Tasarım Dükkan to see if they have a new scarf to add to my collection. Outdoor space is precious in Istanbul, and much of it vertiginous. Yildiz Park, not far from Dolmabahçe Palace, cascades down the banks of the Bosphorus, offering a leafy retreat from the traffic. I enjoy Turkish breakfast here with friends in Malta Köşkü – which was built for Sultan Abdülaziz as a hunting pavilion – or pack a picnic to eat on one of the grassy terraces. Recently I have taken to walking the paths along Haliç. Broad tracts of flat land have been created on either side of the estuary using the sludge removed from the waterway. The gardens are a work in progress but it’s great to see them take shape. Evenings out in Istanbul usually revolve around meeting up with friends for dinner, to eat and talk over a glass of wine or two. For that I like to go to Viktor Levi Şarap Evi, a long-established wine house in Kadiköy. It produces its own wine, with bottles labelled by the number. The interior is like a gentlemen’s club, with cosy banquettes, and there’s alfresco dining in the garden. When I want to dance, I go to Babylon. It’s a club where everyone focuses on the music and having a good time so it’s like being at a party full of friends. They have live acts as well as DJs from around the world. The charming and quirky Hotel Empress Zoe (doubles from £42 B&B) has a labyrinth-like layout that mirrors the complexity of the city’s history. The reception area is down a short set of stairs and incorporates part of the wall of a Byzantine Palace. From there, a spiral staircase winds up to rooms ornamented with timber detailing and handwoven rugs, and a garden lush with palm trees and other exotic plants. It’s within easy walking distance of the Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque.",Lifestyle/Travel,"A local’s guide to Istanbul: mosques, slow-cooked kebabs and the magnificent Bosphorus",https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/jan/08/a-locals-guide-to-istanbul-turkey-mosques-slow-cooked-kebabs-and-the-magnificent-bosphorus
