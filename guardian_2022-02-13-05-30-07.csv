2/13/2022,"The Taliban have detained 29 women and their families in Kabul, a senior US diplomat said on Saturday, adding to concerns about rising numbers of people seized and held indefinitely in Afghanistan. Rina Amiri, US special envoy for Afghan Women, Girls & Human Rights, said that women were among 40 people seized on Friday. “These unjust detentions must stop,” she said in a tweet.  It has since been deleted, but other sources confirmed that multiple women had been detained in Kabul. The state department did not respond to requests for comment on why it was removed. Earlier on Friday the Taliban released a group of journalists including two foreigners, after news of their detention caused an international outcry. They also freed an activist who had disappeared after a women’s rights protest, amid mounting diplomatic pressure including from the UN secretary general. “I am increasingly concerned about the wellbeing of missing women activists in Afghanistan. Several have ‘disappeared’, some not heard from in weeks,” António Guterres had said on Twitter on Thursday. “I strongly urge the Taliban to ensure their safety so that they can return home.” But other female activists, some who were abducted from their homes in the middle of the night, have not been set free. The Taliban police and the Interior ministry denied any role in their arrests. Rights groups denounced the disappearances as a campaign of intimidation, after the Taliban brought in oppressive rules including barring girls from secondary education, and women from most work outside the health and education sectors. “Every disappearance highlights one of the huge gaps in Afghanistan today, the lack of rule of law,” said Heather Barr, associate women’s rights director at Human Rights Watch. “This is not how you act when you are trying to be a government, and it highlights the callousness with which they seem to think they can just abduct women and sloppily deny it.” There are also concerns about Alia Azizi, a senior prison official who has been missing for more than four months after reporting for work. Several women who worked for the security forces under the previous government have been attacked and killed since the Taliban came to power. “While we welcome the release of Parwana, these families and others, including Alia, are still detained,” Amiri said in her tweet. None of those held have been charged with any crime, or able to contact lawyers or speak to their families. The British government has also raised concerns about citizens who have been held for several months. The family of cameraman-turned-businessman Peter Jouvenal have gone public with their concerns about his health, since he was seized in December. He is married to an Afghan citizen and was in Kabul for work and to settle family affairs. Friends are concerned about his health and safety; he requires medication for high blood pressure and Covid is rampant in the Afghan prison system.",News/World news,"Taliban have detained 29 women and their families in Kabul, says US envoy",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/12/taliban-have-detained-29-women-and-their-families-in-kabul-says-us-envoy
2/13/2022,"For Liverpool, Wednesday’s Champions League tie against Internazionale will inevitably conjure memories of 1965. Leading 3-1 from the first leg of their first European Cup semi-final, Liverpool went to San Siro and lost 3-0 in a game that players insist was fixed. The first Inter goal was scored direct from a free-kick they believed to be indirect, the second after the ball was nicked from the goalkeeper Tommy Lawrence as he bounced it before clearing. The evidence in that instance is circumstantial, although as Brian Glanville noted in an investigation into match-fixing in the Sunday Times almost a decade later, Italian sides did remarkably well when the referee who officiated that game, José María Ortiz de Mendíbil, was in charge. There had been some very strange decisions as well in the previous year’s semi-final when Inter had beaten Borussia Dortmund, but the first concrete evidence of fixing came the following year.  As the Hungarian journalist Péter Borenich revealed in his 1983 book Csak a labdán van bőr, ”Only the Ball has a Skin”, Budapest in the 1960s and 70s became the nexus of European match-fixing. At its heart was the Hungarian Dezső Solti, who had approached the referee György Vadás, offering him enough money for “five, six Mercedes” to ensure Inter beat Real Madrid in the semi-final first leg. But Vadás refused, the game finished 1-1 and it was Madrid who went on to beat Partizan in the 1966 final. By 1983, Solti was already serving a ban from football for his part in the scandal exposed by Glanville, having offered the Portuguese referee Francisco Marques Lobo $5,000 and a car if he ensured Juventus beat Derby in the semi-final of the 1973 European Cup. Lobo reported the approach and is generally deemed to have officiated the second leg fairly but the damage had been done in the first leg, which Juve won 3-1. Brian Clough was so certain the game had been fixed that the Derby manager’s post-match press conference consisted of a single sentence: “I will not speak to cheating bastards; to cheating bastards I will not speak.” As he left, he turned to Glanville: “Translate that for them, Brian.” If Solti is remembered at all now, it is as a bogeyman, but his story is far more complicated than that. He was born Dezső Steinberger in 1912 to a family of merchants in Balmazújváros, a small town 20 miles north-west of Debrecen. In 1944, after the German invasion of Hungary, he was rounded up with the area’s other Jews and sent to Auschwitz. His immediate family was killed within hours of arrival but Steinberger was physically fit and so used as labour. He played in goal for one of the camp football teams and began to secure favours by informing on other prisoners. At some point in the winter of 1944-45, Steinberger fixed an SS officer’s car. Impressed by his linguistic ability and general usefulness, the officer began to use Steinberger as a runner and general factotum. That officer was Josef Mengele. As Soviet forces closed in, Steinberger went on one of the death marches west. Having spent time at Dachau and Mühldorf-Mettenheim he was packed on a train to be taken into the mountains and massacred. However, a local Wehrmacht commander, in a fit of conscience, delayed the train to ensure it would be intercepted by US forces. The US housed him in a temporary camp at Feldafing near Munich, and he was interviewed over his links with Mengele before, eventually, being returned to Hungary. The war had changed him. “I was weakened in everything,” he wrote in his memoir. “I was weak in character, in will, in everything. Auschwitz burned everything.” He was approached by the ÁVH, the Hungarian secret police. Péter Veres, the head of the National Peasants Party, who was the biggest opponent of the Communist programme of collectivisation, was also from Balmazújváros. Did Steinberger know him, and could he trap him into something that would force him to resign? He could, and he did. As a reward, Steinberger said he wanted to leave the country. The ÁVH told him it could be done if he qualified for an entertainer’s visa. So Steinberger trained as a stage magician and, in 1949, he was granted a passport, issued in the name Dezső Solti. He left for Italy with six female dancers he claimed were essential to his act, but it is clear from ÁVH records that this was cover for trafficking prostitutes. In Milan, Solti met the great coach Béla Guttmann, another Hungarian Jew. It was Solti’s car, imported from the US, that Guttmann was driving (without a licence) when he struck and killed a 17-year-old student. Solti took the blame for long enough that Guttmann was able to leave the country and avoid the courts. Solti worked with football clubs as an agent – and then more. In March 1990, Solti spent a day with the film director Béla Szobolits, who was researching a documentary. “He was good-humoured with a mischievous look in his eyes,” Szobolits said. “He talked a lot about women. He was very religious, sensitive, easily moved. “He lived alone in a very average two-bedroom apartment in Milan. Every day he got up at 7am and prayed for an hour. He would read passages from the Torah. There was a Jewish jeweller of about his age from Romania who came round between 10 and 12 every day. Solti would have lunch alone and sleep. Then, he read the newspapers and went into the town centre for an ice cream. He read philosophy after that. He would have his evening meal, then stand in the window looking over the city, taking in the fresh air, before going to bed after midnight.” Solti didn’t exactly come clean, but he did admit he had at times given gold watches to referees. “Football is a game of fine margins,” he told Szobolits. “All we did was try to ensure those were not against Inter. If a free-kick is going to be given one way or the other, we wanted to make sure we were seen as the victim not the opposition.” Just another ambiguity in a life lived in a world of limited morality.",Sport/Football,Notorious match-fixer Solti’s game of fine margins echoes down the years | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/12/notorious-match-fixer-soltis-game-of-fine-margins-echoes-down-the-years
2/13/2022,"First-half goals from Filip Helander, Kemar Roofe and Fashion Sakala sealed a comfortable 3-0 victory for Rangers against Annan Athletic at Galabank to secure their place in the Scottish Cup quarter-finals. Giovanni van Bronckhorst changed the whole team from their midweek defeat of Hibs, handing Aaron Ramsey and Mateusz Zukowski both made their first starts with Helander featuring for the first time in five months after recovering from a knee injury.  Helander headed in the opening goal after seven minutes before strikers Kemar Roofe and Fashion Sakala added further goals to end any hopes of the League Two side providing a shock. Hearts progressed to the quarter-finals beating Livingston 4-3 on penalties. The contest finished 0-0 after extra time at Tynecastle with the visitors coming closest to breaking the deadlock in 90 minutes when Scott Pittman hit the post. Livingston’s Cristiano Montaño struck the outside of a post and Ayo Obileye had his penalty saved by Craig Gordon. John Souttar, Peter Haring, Ben Woodburn and Ellis Simms all converted as Hearts edged through. Greg Kiltie scored two goals to help St Mirren to a comprehensive 4-0 win over second division Kelty Hearts. The Buddies opened the scoring after 16 minutes when Alex Grieve followed up a save by Darren Jamieson from a Richard Tait attempt to nod in. Jordan Jones superb strike increased their lead after 50 minutes and he assisted Kiltie to score after 58 minutes. Kiltie added the fourth goal with five minutes remaining. Kevin van Veen and Connor Shields scored as Motherwell fought back to beat Aberdeen 2-1 at Fir Park to secure their passage to the next round. Christian Ramírez opened the scoring with a header for Aberdeen in the third minute and the visitors appeared to be on course to bounce back from their defeat to Celtic in midweek.

2/13/2022,"Chelsea can finally call themselves champions of the world. Nine years on from losing in the final of this competition to Corinthians, they were determined to make history and the celebrations were joyous when the full-time whistle blew and they had ended their long wait to win the only trophy to have eluded them in the Roman Abramovich era. Perhaps it had to be this way. It seemed Chelsea would need a penalty shootout before Kai Havertz, the man who scored the only goal when Thomas Tuchel’s side won the Champions League, stepped up to make history with three minutes to go. César Azpilicueta, the first Chelsea player to have won every club trophy, had won a penalty and Havertz was nerveless from the spot, finally ending Palmeiras’s stout resistance.  Chelsea had led through Romelu Lukaku’s goal, only to concede a penalty to Raphael Veiga. Palmeiras, who finished with 10 men after Luan’s late red card, gave everything as they looked to become world champions for the first time. This was an occasion to savour, even though Fifa’s official cheerleaders would not be swayed from their doomed attempts to silence the Brazilian din with some ludicrous pre-match entertainment. Memo to Gianni Infantino: Palmeiras’s 15,000 supporters needed no help creating an atmosphere. The noise was deafening long before kick-off, most of the ground decked out in green and white, and initially there was a sense of Chelsea trying to draw the sting, their approaching seemingly to calm the crowd by hoarding possession and taking few risks on the ball. As the opening period wore on, though, the more it felt as if Chelsea were being too polite. Tuchel, who was on the touchline after flying to Abu Dhabi on Friday, did not see enough urgency. He had taken no chances, disappointing Kepa Arrizabalaga by starting Édouard Mendy in goal, but Chelsea were unconvincing. Their set-pieces were poor and there was too much wastefulness in the final third, Havertz shooting wide when he might have released Callum Hudson-Odoi in the 25th minute. The attacks felt forced. With Lukaku isolated against Gustavo Gómez and Luan, there was little cohesion to Chelsea’s attempts to break the Copa Libertadores champions down. Thiago Silva saw a long-range effort saved by Weverton and Antonio Rüdiger headed narrowly wide, but a goal rarely looked likely and the sense of foreboding grew when Mason Mount had to make way for Christian Pulisic in the 31st minute. Palmeiras, well drilled by their Portuguese manager, must have taken confidence from Mason Mount limping off. Compact in their low block, they were growing into the game. Ze Rafael was energetic in midfield and Palmeiras were dangerous when they crept forward, Dudu having the best effort of the half when he fired over from 20 yards. Dudu was showing plenty of willing. The striker ran the channels and he was unlucky with his second chance, Ze Rafael’s undercooked pass forcing him to pull a shot wide as Andreas Christensen closed him down. Chelsea were too open. Christensen would also have to make a vital intervention when Ze Rafael burst down the left and Tuchel cannot have had many kind things to say to his players during the interval. With Abramovich in the stands, Chelsea needed to improve. They had to show more urgency and the signs were encouraging at the start of the second half, N’Golo Kanté and Mateo Kovacic offering more poise in the middle and Hudson-Odoi pushing on from left wing-back. It seemed that Chelsea had realised that they were allowed to use their wide players. They were beginning to stretch Palmeiras and the shift soon brought a reward. Hudson-Odoi reached the byline before crossing with his left foot – his weaker side – and Lukaku, who had been crying out for that kind of service, sent a stunning header past Weverton after bullying Luan in the air. Surely the natural order had asserted itself. Chelsea’s £97.5m striker had shown his class and for a brief moment it seemed that Palmeiras, who had given so much to the defensive effort, had run out of belief. Soon, though, their fans were roaring again. Chelsea, normally so streetwise on these nights, had been caught out by the simplest of moves. A long throw in the 62nd minute was enough to cause the panic and it was difficult to know what Silva was complaining about when Scott Beath pointed to the spot after consulting the VAR monitor. The Brazilian defender had clearly handled as he challenged Gómez and Chelsea were back to square one when Veiga calmly sent Mendy the wrong way from 12 yards. Palmeiras, by contrast, were starting to dream. Veiga, a nimble No10, tested Mendy from the edge of the area and Chelsea’s frustration grew when Pulisic shot inches wide from the edge of the area. Desperate for a spark, Tuchel made some curious changes. The players who made the opening goal came off, Lukaku and Hudson-Odoi making way for Timo Werner and Saúl Niguez, but Chelsea had become predictable by the end of normal time. Tuchel kept tweaking. The introduction of Malang Sarr and Hakim Ziyech for Christensen and Kovacic saw Chelsea ditch their 3-4-2-1 for a 4-2-4, but there was no sign of a breakthrough during the first half of extra time. Palmeiras were defending bravely and Chelsea grew irritable, Pulisic and Ziyech bickering with each other as half-time approached. Yet the pressure grew and Chelsea broke through when another VAR check confirmed that Azpilicueta’s volley was handled by Luan, who was shown a yellow card. The Palmeiras players were heartbroken. Havertz stepped up to put the penalty away and Chelsea, who have already won three trophies under Tuchel’s brief management, had made history.",Sport/Football,Chelsea crowned world champions after Kai Havertz penalty sink Palmeiras,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/12/chelsea-palmeiras-club-world-cup-final-match-report
2/13/2022,"Pep Guardiola may outwardly fear a title fight but that would require Manchester City to make a misstep. They have taken 43 points from the last 45 and, while Norwich revealed hints of fallibility early on, this was as comfortable as most of the victories that came before it. A hat-trick from Raheem Sterling, including a sublime opener and a late penalty rebound, was supplemented by Phil Foden, and City could have scored more. Norwich’s survival bid will neither stand nor fall on nights like this, but Dean Smith may wonder how things would have developed if Grant Hanley’s header had not struck the post with the score goalless.  Smith had proclaimed Norwich to be “in the fight” after taking seven points from three games; any positive result here would add potency to the idea and the Canaries could recall that, on City’s most recent visit, in September 2019, they heroically won 3-2. Kenny McLean and Teemu Pukki were the only survivors in Smith’s starting lineup, and as it happened, both players had scored that afternoon. When Pukki warmed Ederson’s palms from an angle in the 10th minute, profiting from an enterprising run by Brandon Williams, it was a reminder Norwich were capable of baring their teeth. They had lived dangerously until then, surviving by a whisker when Bernardo Silva cut inside from the right and snaked a shot against Angus Gunn’s far post. Ilkay Gündogan then headed straight at the goalkeeper from a position that promised better, allowing a comfortable save when Oleksandr Zinchenko found him unmarked. Quickly enough, this became a good game. City dominated, as anyone might expect, Gündogan and Silva flashing across deliveries that narrowly evaded onrushing feet. But they looked vulnerable to Norwich’s forays: neither Zinchenko nor Nathan Aké, both of whom had been recalled to the starting lineup, looked comfortable and they were almost exposed after a spell of sloppiness. A dash by Milot Rashica had been crudely halted by Rúben Dias, who was booked, and prompted a spell of Norwich pressure. When Pierre Lees-Melou retrieved a half-cleared corner and crossed, Grant Hanley planted a firm header down to Ederson’s left. It struck the woodwork and was cleared: City weathered the resulting skirmishes and it felt a key moment in the evening. Relegation battlers do not get many chances like that against City and, inevitably, will give up rather more. Gunn saved from Sterling with a leg but, when Norwich made a conspicuous individual mistake, it was punished. Just after the half-hour, Max Aarons should have intercepted Kyle Walker’s ball across the area but failed to connect. Sterling took possession in the kind of position he relishes, shifting the ball on to his right foot and curling a delicious finish beyond Gunn. It was Sterling’s first goal of the calendar year and hard on Aarons, who had just caused flutters with an enterprising run to the byline. Kenny McLean immediately dragged wide from a promising position but, by half-time, Riyad Mahrez and Gündogan had both come close to effectively making things safe. For Norwich the instructions would have been to stay competitive for as long as possible but, within 80 seconds of the restart, their best-laid plans were shattered. That was thanks to the muckiest of goals from Foden, who had initially drawn a save from Gunn after meeting Gündogan’s cutback with an awkward effort off his thigh. He dug the ball back out, at some length, as it squirmed around the six-yard box and scrambled in an effort that deflected off Williams. Although Hanley hacked clear, it had already crossed the line by a foot. The game was virtually over now, as most of those present seemed to acknowledge. When Norwich tried to spring a counter, Ederson found himself sweeping up and fleetingly joining his midfield; the busy Rashica then made him work more conventionally with a firm strike but City were otherwise in total control. Twenty minutes from time they reiterated the point, Sterling converting from a couple of yards after Dias had nodded Foden’s delivery across goal. Guardiola could deploy a few youngsters, including the league debutant Kayky, in the closing minutes. Sterling beat Gunn at the second attempt before the end and, protest though his manager may, it is all looking too easy.",Sport/Football,Raheem Sterling hits hat-trick in easy Manchester City win at Norwich,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/12/norwich-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report
