2/19/2022,"BIDEN: ""As of this moment I'm convinced he's made the decision."" U.S. President Joe Biden said on Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine, and that he continues to spread false information... building a pretext for a military strike that could happen in days. ""We believe that they will target Ukraine's capital of Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million innocent people. We're calling out Russia's plans loudly and repeatedly, not because we want a conflict, but because we're doing everything in our power to remove every reason that Russia may give to justify invading Ukraine, and prevent them from moving."" Biden said Russia is pushing out disinformation, and said Russia-backed separatists have falsely claimed Ukraine is planning an attack. ""There is simply no evidence of these assertions, and it defies basic logic to believe the Ukrainians would choose this moment, with well over 150,000 troops arrayed on its borders to escalate a year-long conflict."" Earlier Friday, separatists backed by Moscow told civilians in eastern Ukraine to leave breakaway regions on buses, saying they would evacuate hundreds of thousands of citizens to Russia; a move the US believes could be part of a pretext for an attack. Russia wants to stop Ukraine from joining NATO and accuses the West of hysteria, saying it has no plans to invade. Moscow has released footage it says shows it is withdrawing troops from the border, but the U.S. and allies are adamant the military build-up is continuing. Biden's comments came after a phone call with leaders of NATO, the European Union and several countries. The leaders pledged to continue pursuing diplomacy while preparing to impose swift, coordinated economic sanctions on Russia should it choose further conflict.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Biden says Putin has decided to invade Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/biden-says-putin-decided-invade-011354074.html

2/19/2022,"NATO allies, including White House officials, are concerned by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky‚Äôs decision to depart Kyiv for the Munich Security Conference this weekend, sources told Fox News Friday. Allies of the 30-member alliance are reportedly worried that Russia could exploit the president‚Äôs absence as tension in Eastern Europe has reached a boiling point not seen in decades. STATE DEPARTMENT CALLS EVACUATIONS IN EASTERN UKRAINE 'FALSE FLAG OPERATIONS,' WARNS OF DISTRACTIONS Zelenskyy, who is set to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday, is expected to be a key target if Russia does successfully invade Kyiv, sources confirmed. President Biden said Friday he is ""convinced"" that Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to invade Ukraine. In answer to questions from reporters as to whether he believed it would be a mistake for Zelensky to leave Ukraine at this time Biden said, ""It may not be‚Ä¶the wise choice, but it's his decision."" ""That's a judgment for him to make,"" Biden said. ""It's in the pursuit of a diplomatic solution."" A senior U.S. defense official told Fox News Digital there is a strong possibility of a ""significant invasion"" by the Russian military in the coming days and Kyiv is its sites. The official said Russian military forces have left their barracks and that roughly 40-50% of Putin's troops have moved into attack positions ‚Äî putting them within striking distance of the Ukrainian border. Putin now has 120-125 Battalion Tactical Groups amassed along Ukraine's border. All Special Forces have been mobilized, and rocket forces along with ballistic missile units are within range of the capital. Destabilization efforts that the U.S. and NATO have warned against ""has begun,"" the senior U.S. defense official said. Tensions in Eastern Ukraine, where Russia-backed separatists have clashed with the Ukrainian military since 2014, mounted this week and resulted in an exchange of artillery shelling that began Thursday. KYIV MAYOR PLEADS WITH US, GERMANY OVER THREAT OF RUSSIAN INVASION: 'WE CAN'T DEFEND OUR COUNTRY' Leaders of two the separatist groups called for an evacuation of the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, and leaders of the self-proclaimed republics claimed Friday that Russia has allegedly agreed to host evacuees. Ukrainian officials and Russian-backed separatists have blamed each other for the attacks. The U.S. has not said who is responsible for the attacks, but officials have been sounding the alarm that Russia is laying the groundwork for an incursion. The State Department this week pointed to false claims by Putin regarding human rights abuses, and a spokesperson told Fox News Digital the evacuation effort is just the latest ""false flag operation."" Harris reaffirmed that the Biden administration remains committed to engaging with Moscow, but said the focus of the security talks will be in maintaining a united front to deter Russian aggression. ""We have made clear that we remain open to diplomacy,"" she said from Munich Friday.

2/19/2022,"The Manhattan DA's ex-investigations chief can't understand: why no search warrant on Donald Trump? Trump has successfully fought documents subpoenas for three years, until Thursday. Other former Manhattan prosecutors say search warrants can actually hinder a probe. A former top prosecutor with the Manhattan District Attorney's Office says it is ""remarkable"" that former President Donald Trump has managed to keep his business files out of the hands of local investigators throughout three years of subpoenas and court battles. Only on Thursday did a Manhattan judge order Trump to comply with a series of New York Attorney General civil subpoenas for the former president's testimony and personal business documents, many of which the AG believes he has kept at his headquarters in Trump Tower. But with both the AG and the DA conducting parallel probes, why, wondered former Manhattan DA Investigations Chief Adam Kaufmann, hasn't the DA simply gone into Trump Tower with empty boxes and a search warrant? Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Put another way, why rely on the more dainty, drawn-out process of civil subpoenas ‚Äî AG Letitia James issued her first demand for Trump business documents in early 2019. ""This is remarkable,"" Kaufmann told Insider of the long battle for Trump's files. ""It suggests that after all this time, The Trump Organization has managed to evade disclosure of the very records that would point directly to the involvement and knowledge ‚Äî or lack thereof ‚Äî of Trump himself,"" he said. ""What I do not understand is this,"" added Kaufmann, a partner specializing in white-collar criminal defense at Lewis Baach Kaufmann Middlemiss. ""If this is true, and there are documents constituting evidence still with The Trump Organization, then why has the DA not gone after those documents in any fashion, or gone after the Trump Organization for not producing them?"" The Manhattan DA's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Still, search warrants can be problematic. ""The pros are, obviously, you don't have to trust the company ‚Äî you just take stuff,"" said Daniel R. Alonso, who as former chief assistant DA was second only to Cyrus Vance during his first term. ""A search warrant has the element of surprise,"" said Alonso, a partner at Buckley LLP. ""It's a fantastic tool when an investigation has been covert up until that moment."" The cons, he said, are that getting a search warrant ""takes a ton of resources, and you can be challenged if you are wrong about probable cause or if you seize a document that's beyond the scope of the warrant."" Search warrants can work well when law enforcement wants to seize such physical evidence as guns, drugs, or money, says white-collar defense attorney John Moscow, who prosecuted complex financial crimes at the Manhattan DA's office. ""There are times you know something is there, you know where it is, and you go in and grab it before it moves,"" Moscow, told Insider. But when investigators are looking for paper, subpoenaing whoever has that paper is typically the better route, he said. That person is then the one who has to gather up the responsive documents ‚Äî and they can then be asked to sit down and provide context for each page. ""If it's paperwork, as a prosecutor you need someone to sit down and walk you through that paperwork, and say what the documents are,"" said Moscow, who is senior counsel at Lewis Baach. ""Your chances of that are much better with a subpoena, and you can't do that with a search warrant."" Then there is the question of whether the documents James initially sought will still be produced now, three years later. In court papers filed in January, James complained that Trump officials were not sufficiently helping a third-party document search firm that has been hired, under court order, to help gather all subpoenaed documents. ""Now, it's late in the game,"" said Alonso. ""Without suggesting anything untoward, to me, if there was smoking gun physical documents it's less likely that they're still there"" three years later. Still, hiding or even destroying documents can come back to haunt a defendant. First of all, it's illegal and punishable by a contempt of court charge. ""The state has stronger law on this than federal law,"" said Alonso. ""The company or the individual can be held in contempt."" And destroying a document can backfire in a big way. ""[DC-based defense lawyer] Bob Bennett likes to say 'No document is as damaging as one that can be proven to have existed,"" Moscow said, ""but which isn't produced.""
