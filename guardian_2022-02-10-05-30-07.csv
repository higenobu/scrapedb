2/10/2022,"The Home Office was accused of presiding over a “shocking miscarriage of justice” by MPs during an urgent debate on the English language testing scandal which saw thousands of international students wrongly accused of cheating in an exam they were required to sit as part of their visa application process. Those students who were wrongly accused of deception, many of whom were subsequently detained and deported, should now be helped to clear their names, shadow Home Office minister Stephen Kinnock told parliament.  About 2,500 students have been forcibly removed from the UK after being accused of cheating in the exam and a further 7,200 left the country after being warned that they faced detention and removal if they stayed. Kinnock said the Home Office was not fit for purpose, adding that this case brought the department’s fundamental flaws into “one toxic combination of indifference and incompetence”. New information unearthed by a BBC documentary has raised further doubts about the reliability of the evidence used by the Home Office to accuse students cheating in the tests. A BBC Newsnight investigation revealed that the Home Office has continued to try to remove students from the UK, despite being aware that there were flaws in the data provided as evidence of cheating. Campaigners have been working since 2014 to help students fight the allegations, and the Home Office’s record on the English language testing scandal has already been the focus of a critical report by the National Audit Office. The US firm Educational Testing Service (ETS) was licensed by the Home Office to operate a test to establish if overseas students had a high enough level of English to study in the UK. In 2014 undercover filming by Panorama uncovered organised cheating in two of the 90 Home Office-approved centres offering the exam. The government responded by asking ETS to assess whether the 58,459 tests taken between 2011 and 2014 were valid. The company made checks and concluded that 97% of the tests taken were suspicious. Questions have repeatedly been asked about whether it was plausible that 97% of those who took the officially approved test could have been involved in cheating. The Home Office has faced criticism for allowing ETS to conduct the investigation into cheating allegations. Many students have protested their innocence and over 12,500 legal appeals against the Home Office decision to refuse visas on cheating allegations have been heard in UK courts; more than 3,600 people have won their appeals. Shana Shaikh, 33, came to London from India to study for a masters in business in 2011. She was already fluent in English, having completed an undergraduate chemistry degree which was taught in English, but she was required to take the test in order to renew her student visa in 2014. She was accused of cheating in the exam and has subsequently spent about £20,000 on legal fees attempting to get the accusation overturned. In the seven years since the accusation was made, she has not been able to work, travel or study; she is still waiting for a decision on her case. “I have been mentally destroyed by this accusation. I’m not able to get on with the rest of my life. I invested thousands of pounds to pay for a good education from this country. I’ve done nothing wrong, but I have been treated worse than a criminal,” she said. “I spoke very good English. I come from a very educated family, I wanted to do a PhD here. Why would I cheat in the test?” Jakir Hussan, 35, came to the UK on a student visa from Bangladesh in 2009, and was accused of cheating after taking a test in 2014. He spent three months in an immigration detention centre, and has also spent over £20,000 on legal fees. “I came here with ambitions and dreams but my future has been destroyed,” he said. “Some relatives in my home country think that I did cheat; I feel ashamed and I lost ties with them. The most important thing for me is to clear my name so I can show my face to them.” An ETS spokeswoman said “several actions were promptly taken” after it was made aware of “serious allegations” involving test of English for international communication (Toeic) testing in the UK, which it said were conducted by third-party contractors. “ETS has co-operated with investigators … ETS shared our methodology and findings with the UK Home Office but did not make any recommendations in relation to the same, nor was ETS involved in determining how such information was utilised by the Home Office in its subsequent actions.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “Courts have consistently found that the evidence we had at the time was sufficient to take action. We have made significant improvements to ensure large-scale abuse like this can never happen again. We have fixed the broken student visa system as it operated in 2014 and overhauled English language testing requirements.”",News/UK news,English test scandal: Home Office accused of ‘shocking miscarriage of justice’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/09/english-test-scandal-home-office-accused-of-shocking-miscarriage-of-justice
2/10/2022,"Racial tropes and stereotypes have continued to loom large in documentaries centred on black people despite pledges by the BBC and other broadcasters to change after the killing of George Floyd, according to new research. Senior black professionals working in British television also voiced concern that the commissioning of ‘black programming’ was predominantly viewed through the interests of white commissioners.  The report, commissioned by the Sir Lenny Henry Centre for Media Diversity, examined 275 documentary programmes between April and May last year. It found that race and racism were still the leading subject matters when a programme featured a black person. Crime was the second most popular subject while music was third across documentaries, a sector of TV in which black people disproportionately work in comparison with much lower levels of representation in drama, for example. Black professionals working in the documentary genre also warned that the situation was being compounded by a lack of career progression among black media workers to positions of editorial control with real commissioning power. Black documentary film-makers were often having to push back at stereotypical representations of black people on the projects they were working on, while black production company owners were not being given the same opportunities as non-black production company owners. Maxine Watson, an award-winning producer and former commissioner of BBC documentaries, said: “When TV talks about a ‘broad audience’ they are really talking about the broad white audience. So that means making sure niche or targeted subjects are done in a way that will appeal to that audience.” The report, Black in Fact – Beyond the White Gaze, was conducted by award-winning documentary producer and director Cherish Oteka. They noted that the BBC had the biggest sample size of 127 programmes that either featured black people or were about black experiences. Of the 127 programmes, 27% had race as the central premise of the show, making this the leading category for black stories on the BBC iPlayer. But they warned: “When stories about the black experience are repeatedly told through the prism of racism, it limits the breadth of experiences that black people have and, as a consequence, the black experience is positioned as one marked solely by trauma.” They also highlighted concerns in relation to the BBC’s second biggest category of black programming, crime. “Black stories have long been told in close relation to crime and criminality – the BBC’s representation of crime within black contexts ranged from murder and knife crime to sexual assault and harassment, child abuse, drug dealing, gangs and account scams. This creates a troubling association of fear and crime with the black community,” they said. Oteka said that black producers or directors were often brought on board in documentary making to tell a black story but no real structural change happens. “The production company is still white-owned and white-led, the crew is still predominantly white, the commissioner is white and the story is being shaped and primed to please a white audience,” they said. Patrick Younge, a former BBC executive who was among industry professionals who spoke about their perception of black representation on UK public service broadcasters, said: “You can put black people on soap operas or a black person on the panel of every panel show; the numbers can rise really easily, it’s not hard at all. But whose story are they telling and from what perspective? That hasn’t really changed.”",Arts/Television & radio,"Black Britons in documentary still boxed in by race, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/09/black-britons-in-documentary-still-boxed-in-by-race-report-finds
2/10/2022,"Rebekah Vardy has been accused of being a “habitual” leaker of private information about Coleen Rooney to the Sun newspaper, at the latest hearing in the “Wagatha Christie” case. Lawyers for Rooney alleged at the high court on Wednesday that Vardy received money from the tabloid and was regularly providing information to the newspaper’s journalists – including material from Rooney’s private Instagram account.  They claim that Vardy authorised her agent Caroline Watt to access her personal Instagram account, which was then used to monitor Rooney’s posts and pass information to the Sun. On Tuesday the court heard Vardy sent WhatsApp messages saying she “would love” to leak messages about Rooney to the media and apparently described her as a “nasty bitch”. Vardy’s lawyers say this message is not evidence she actually leaked any stories and “nasty bitch” was referring to someone else. They also stood by a claim that Watt’s mobile phone was accidentally dropped off the side of a boat into the North Sea, shortly after a legal request was made to search the device for potential evidence. Hugh Tomlinson QC said: “That is what happened. Mrs Vardy was not present when that happened. She [the agent] was on holiday, she lost her phone.” In 2019 Coleen Rooney – the wife of the Derby County manager, Wayne Rooney – accused Vardy of leaking stories from her private Instagram account to the Sun after a months-long sting operation. Rebekah Vardy, who is married to the Leicester City footballer Jamie Vardy, denied the accusation and is suing Rooney for libel. The case is due to go to a full trial in May but a two-day hearing this week has considered which evidence should be taken into account. The libel case could hinge on who, if anyone, with access to Vardy’s Instagram account was providing stories to the Sun. Rooney’s lawyers are attempting to bring Watt into the case, arguing she played a role and alleging she misused Rooney’s private information. They told the court that if Vardy wins her claim on the basis that she was not the specific individual who leaked the information, then Rooney will be left without “vindication” unless she is able to bring the claim against Watt as part of the same case. The court previously heard Vardy had messaged Watt to say she was “offended” that Rooney had publicly named her as the individual leaking information to the Sun. Tomlinson, acting for Vardy, said: “If one reads these messages in full, what one sees is that Mrs Vardy expresses shock at being accused … These are obviously candid personal messages, and if she was really concerned – ‘Oh, this is terrible, we have been found out’ – then it would have been completely different.”",News/UK news,"Rebekah Vardy ‘habitual’ leaker of Coleen Rooney stories to Sun, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/09/rebekah-vardy-habitual-leaker-of-coleen-rooney-stories-to-sun-court-hears
2/10/2022,"Acolourful cast of characters dance round the maypole at the end of Laurie Sansom’s gender-quizzical staging. Designer EM Parry fits them out with a dressing-up box of mix-and-match outfits: sheepskin coat, cowboy hat, naval tunic, wedding veil, bodice and ruff. It is not quite an Adam and the Ants video but it has a new-romantic sense of flamboyance and possibility. There are bare chests and crinoline underskirts. It is the culmination of a Northern Broadsides production of Shakespeare’s pastoral comedy that is all about appearances. It takes place in a forest of hat stands beneath a canopy of dresses; a changing room where everyone is changed.  Here, the play’s search for romantic partnership is also a quest for identity – so often determined by what we wear. It could be the suit of shimmering gold sported by a hirsute Ali Gadema as Duke Frederick or the colourful cabaret outfits shown off by Joe Morrow’s Touchstone. There is something dreamlike about this. Frequently in this languid, autumnal production, Sansom fills the stage with people, bathed in a hazy light, more imaginary than real. The gorgeous accent of Adam Kashmiry’s Jacques, forged in Alexandria and Glasgow, adds to the otherworldly atmosphere. Only Rosalind and Celia are in control. Everyone else is buffeted around. In this way, the production seems to be telling its own story. Shakespeare’s narrative, which resolves with a series of heterosexual couplings, is at odds with the non-binary ethos of the show. It’s not that the playwright himself didn’t play games with identity; a boy actor would have played Rosalind who pretends to be man who role-plays as a woman. It’s that the narrative conventions are too straight for this production. Here, the most compelling relationship is between Rosalind, a playful, expressive EM Williams, and Celia, a joyful, sensitive Isobel Coward. Celia’s declaration that “thou and I am one” when the two are banished into the Forest of Arden overshadows even the charming courtship between Rosalind and Shaban Dar’s Orlando. It means that when Rosalind and Celia leave the stage to prepare for the big reveal, you’re disappointed when they don’t return as one of the happy couples.

2/10/2022,"Forty charities have written to the government calling for the genocide of Roma and Sinti Gypsies to be included as a mandatory part of Holocaust teaching in schools in England, after a joke on the subject by comedian Jimmy Carr prompted outrage. The letter to the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, said better teaching was needed to address widespread ignorance about the murder and torture of more than 500,000 Roma and Sinti people by the Nazi regime, as well as the high levels of prejudice and hate against Roma communities today.  Carr drew widespread condemnation when he said in his Netflix special that the murder of Romany and Sinti Gypsies in the Holocaust was ignored because people did not want to “focus on the positives”. “Public condemnation of the comments is important,” the letter said. “But measures need to be implemented to create meaningful change. This incident has highlighted the pressing need for teaching about the genocide of Roma in the Holocaust to be mandatory on the schools’ curriculum.” The letter, which was organised by Friends, Families and Travellers and Roma Support Group, said YouGov research in 2019 found that 55% of British adults did not know that more than 500,000 Roma and Sinti people were killed by the Nazis. Research from the Equality and Human Rights Commission in 2018, meanwhile, found that 44% of those surveyed expressed openly negative attitudes towards Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities, more than any other protected characteristic group. “There is a clear and strong case for improving education to address this,” the letter said. “Including the history of Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities in school curricula would improve the understanding that the communities are an integral part of both national and European societies, and would act as an effective tool to combat hatred, discrimination and prejudice.” The letter also called for additional teaching to reflect more positive narratives about these communities and suggested that the Department for Education support schools to celebrate Gypsy, Roma and Traveller History Month. Mattey Mitchell, the health campaigns officer at Friends, Families and Travellers, said: “The experiences of Roma and Sinti peoples during the Holocaust remain in living memory, but are still largely unknown to the wider public. When these memories are gone also from our communities, who then will remain to ensure history does not repeat itself?” A DfE spokesperson said: “The atrocities of the Holocaust should not be forgotten, and that is why it is compulsory in the history key stage 3 national curriculum. “As part of Holocaust education, schools have the flexibility to teach about the persecution of different groups of people by the Nazis, including the genocide of the Roma and Sinti communities.” Signatories to the letter include the Anne Frank Trust, the Race Equality Foundation, Show Racism the Red Card and the Runnymede Trust.",News/World news,"Add genocide of Gypsies to national curriculum, say charities",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/09/add-genocide-of-gypsies-to-national-curriculum-say-charities
2/10/2022,"Boris Johnson has appointed a temporary chief operating officer in Downing Street as he rebuilds his depleted top team in an attempt to persuade fractious Tory MPs he can reassert his grip on government. Samantha Jones, a former nurse and healthcare leader – including in the private sector – has been advising the prime minister on managing the pandemic. She will take on the new role for six months.  Jones was until last year the chief executive of Operose Health, the UK subsidiary of a US private health firm called Centene, which provides services including primary care to the NHS. She is also a former NHS trust chief executive. Downing Street said Jones would be chief operating officer and permanent secretary for Downing Street, and would help to establish a new Office of the Prime Minister. One No 10 source described her role as “head of people”, highlighting her experience across the public and private sectors. Two more appointments are expected within days – a “gatekeeper,” whose role No 10 sources compared to that of Tony Blair’s formidable aide Anji Hunter, and a “delivery-focused” person. Both are expected to be what the source called “alpha females”. Alongside “failures of leadership”, Sue Gray’s report into lockdown-busting gatherings in No 10 warned “the leadership structures are fragmented and complicated and this has sometimes led to the blurring of lines of accountability”. Johnson told MPs in response: “I get it and I’ll fix it.” He has already appointed the Cabinet Office minister Steve Barclay to be his new chief of staff, replacing the departing Dan Rosenfield; MP Andrew Griffith as head of policy; and former lobbyist Guto Harri as director of communications. Griffith’s role was hastily announced last Thursday after Johnson’s longstanding policy chief, Munira Mirza, who had been at his side for more than a decade, resigned over his attempt to link Keir Starmer to the failure to prosecute Jimmy Savile. Mirza called the prime minister’s use of the slur “scurrilous”. Jones said: “I look forward to establishing an Office for the Prime Minister that provides him with the professional operation to deliver his agenda.” In a 2017 blog for the Health Foundation, Jones argued that ensuring an organisation had the right culture was just as important as getting the structure right. She said: “You have to change people’s behaviours and that means focusing on leadership, building relationships, and making sure everyone understands and shares a common purpose. “Equally, just focusing on the softer behavioural aspects (arguably the harder work) without structural changes, won’t be sustainable. It is when you put organic behavioural change together with structural change that it really gets powerful.”",News/Politics,Johnson appoints former private health executive as No 10 ‘head of people’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/09/johnson-appoints-former-private-health-executive-as-no-10-head-of-people
2/10/2022,"Good morning. The Morrison government has passed its controversial religious discrimination bill after a marathon all-night sitting of the lower house – expect a day of reaction ahead. Russia and Belarus prepare for joint military exercises, and more Australians turn to renewable energy than ever before. In a long but dramatic debate, the hotly contested religious discrimination bill has passed the lower house, despite five Liberal moderates defecting to help add more extensive protections for LGBTQ+ students. Bridget Archer, Trent Zimmerman, Katie Allen, Fiona Martin and Dave Sharma crossed the floor against the government, helping Labor and the crossbench add protections for LGBTQ+ students into the Sex Discrimination Act. Zimmerman told the house the parliament could not send a message by “omission” by moving to fix sexuality discrimination but not gender identity discrimination: “I could not live with myself if I didn’t seek to address those issues.”  Australians from socially disadvantaged households or communities suffered an “incredible imbalance” in receiving Covid-related fines, a Guardian Australia analysis of freedom of information data has revealed. Towns in north-western New South Wales with high Indigenous populations bore a disproportionate percentage of fines, making up nine of the state’s 10 most-penalised areas, while several suburbs in western Sydney received more than 10 times as many penalty notices as suburbs in Sydney’s east. Redfern Legal Centre’s police accountability solicitor, Samantha Lee, says the numbers show that “those who were over-policed before Covid were just policed more during the pandemic”. Russia and Belarus are to begin 10 days of joint military drills on Thursday, with the Kremlin moving 30,000 troops, two battalions of S-400 surface-to-air missile systems, and numerous fighter jets into Belarusian territory. Vladimir Putin reportedly told French president, Emmanuel Macron, that the troops would leave once the exercises had ended but the drills mark a strong shift from Belarus’ position of neutrality during the 2014 invasion. Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, lies 210km south of its border with Belarus.

2/10/2022,"Cressida Dick would be expected to resign as commissioner of the Metropolitan police if she loses the confidence of London’s mayor, Whitehall and City Hall sources said on Wednesday, with the Conservative government making no attempt to save her. Contingency planning for a new commissioner has already started, with Sadiq Khan telling her she must deliver a convincing plan at their next meeting.  The pair are expected to meet within the next week, with Dick facing the threat of a public declaration of no confidencefrom Khan after Scotland Yard’s leadership failed to tackle a series of confidence-sapping scandals that have rocked the force. Khan backed Dick to be the first ever female commissioner of the Met in 2017, but the rupture between the two has been coming for some time. Khan does not have the power in law to dismiss the commissioner. But a Whitehall source made clear if he declares he lacks confidence in Dick, they would not fight to save her. “This is his call and his decision,”, said the source. Khan told the Guardian that last week’s revelations about messages circulating among officers at Charing Cross police station between 2016 and 2018, discussing the deaths of African babies and the rape of women, was a shock too far. A 90-minute meeting between the pair last Wednesdayleft the London mayor unconvinced she understood the seriousness of the situation. Khan was concerned she lacked a plan to reverse the haemorrhaging in trust and confidence in the Met since she became commissioner almost five years ago. Khan made it clear the Met commissioner was in a perilous position, saying she was “on notice”. He told the Guardian: “It is in the public interest for me to make clear to not just the commissioner, and the home secretary, but to Londoners ….whether or not I have confidence in the leadership of the Met police service.” Khan said the crisis in Scotland Yard damaged people’s willingness to come forward as victims or witnesses, as well as potential recruits – which remain disproportionately white and male compared with the capital’s demography. He also acts as the police and crime commissioner (PCC) for the Met, overseeing the force. The London mayor said he was angered 14 officers at Charing Cross thought racist, misogynistic and discriminatory views were acceptable – and that the root of the problem could be systemic. He said: “What is clear to me that is this is not isolated. This is not historic. It is not one [rogue] police officer there are issues of culture … “That is why I need to be reassured, as the mayor of London and PCC, that the leader of the police service gets it, in terms of the importance to root this out.” He was further angered that an officer was promoted despite having been found to have committed misconduct. Khan said he understood the limits of his powers, with the only precedent being in 2008 when then-London mayor Boris Johnson, declared he had lost confidence inMet commissioner Ian Blair, who then resigned. Anxiety levels have been rising among the Conservative government about the country’s biggest and most high-profile police force. A senior government source told the Guardian there was concern that the Met’s mishaps were damaging confidence in other forces around the country, with others in policing making home secretary Priti Patel aware of that. A senior policing source said that sympathy from other chiefs for Dick was draining away. A Whitehall source added:“I don’t think there is any way if the mayor of London says he has no confidence in the commissioner that her position is tenable. “It would not be for us to intervene or say anything. “If Sadiq Khan comes out and says the commissioner should go, it is within his competency to say that, in the same way any other PCC could.” Officials at the home office and City Hall have “opened channels of communication” to discuss the crises plaguing the Met and the commissioner’s future. The Whitehall source added: “We are now looking at the options if the Mayor declares no confidence.” Responding to the question that Khan, their political opponent, could be bluffing, the source said: “The train is only going one way at City Hall.” Dick’s term would have finished in April this year, but in September she was granted a two-year extension, approved by Patel and backed by Khan. The mood among the Met leadership was downbeat. They feel they have plans in place after dealing with a crisis over race, and announced their own inquiry into the aftermath of Sarah Everard’s kidnapping, rape and murder by a serving Met officer in March 2021.

2/10/2022,"Manufacturing plants at the heart of North America’s automotive industry face potential shortages, shutdowns, layoffs and multi-million dollar losses as “freedom convoy” protestors continue to block traffic on the busiest border crossing between Canada and the United States. The Ambassador Bridge, between the car-manufacturing cities of Detroit and Windsor, remained mostly blocked on Wednesday, as business associations warned that manufacturers in the region risk losing $50m a day because of delays.  Vehicles are Canada’s second-largest export, with the US buying more than 90% of that supply. David Adams, president of auto industry group Global Automakers of Canada, told the Guardian that between 5,000 and 7,000 trucks use the Ambassador Bridge daily to deliver automotive parts. The bridge is responsible for 27% of all Canada-US trade. “It’s a pivotal border crossing,” he said. “Some of the plants are at risk of being shut down.” White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said the US government was watching the protests closely. “The blockade poses a risk to supply chains, for the auto industry,” she said. Meanwhile hundreds of protestors remain encamped in Canada’s capital Ottawa, and others blockaded a second international bridge in Alberta also remained. Flavio Volpe, head of Canada’s Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association – said the blockades, organized in the name of Canadian truckers who oppose mandatory mask mandates – could result in layoffs for the very people the protests purportedly represent. Volpe described the blockade as a “brain dead move.” “By allowing the protests to continue, we’re giving the impression that you can take over the country with a couple Hyundai Tucsons and a flimsy cover that you’re representing a group that has clearly said you do not,” Volpe told the Guardian. He said that the blockade could ultimately lead to the shutdown of automotive parts manufacturers on both sides of the border. “This is literally the stupidest thing you could do,” he continued. Between 50 and 75 vehicles and 100 individuals were involved in the blockade, Windsor police chief Pam Mizuno said on Wednesday. At the same news conference, Windsor mayor Drew Dilkens said that the demonstration had so far been “peaceful and without incident” but added that local authorities have requested additional support. He also said he didn’t want to “risk additional conflict” by removing protesters. Police have repeatedly been accused of turning a blind eye to brazen infractions of the law as protests proliferate across the country. The protest movement was initially spurred by a federal vaccine mandate for truck drivers crossing the Canada-US border, but has evolved into a mixture of anti-vaccination, anti-mandate, anti-government complaints. In Ottawa, 23 arrests have been made and hundreds of tickets have been issued by local police. But the downtown area remains paralysed by rows of trucks and other vehicles, some of which are parked directly in front of the Canadian Parlaiment. Police say a considerable amount of financial support is coming from the US, which has enabled protesters to stay in place. Dozens of small businesses and their employees have been affected by the blockades, some of them having to close for the duration of the protests to avoid run-ins with the protesters – many of whom are unvaccinated and who refuse to wear masks inside. Convoy representatives have said they have no intention of leaving until their demands are met. Late on Tuesday, one organizer prompted concern with comments that the protest convoy would move on to Canada’s most populous city, Toronto, but he later said he was just “playing a game” with the police. But on online protestor channels, calls were made to block additional border crossings between Canada and the US, further threatening a trade relationship valued at more than $700bn USD. Meanwhile anti-vaccine mandate protestors in France launched their own “freedom convoy”, with many displaying Canadian flags. Some 200 protesters assembled in a parking lot in Nice, on France’s Mediterranean coast, saying that said they planned to head first to Paris, then on to Brussels to demand the scrapping of rules barring people from public venues if they do not have a Covid-19 vaccination.",News/World news,"Auto plants face shortages, shutdowns and layoffs as protesters block US-Canada bridge",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/09/us-auto-plants-face-shortages-shutdowns-layoffs-protesters-block-canada-bridge
2/10/2022,"Kurt Zouma has been fined £250,000 by his club and had his cats taken away by the RSPCA after a video emerged of the footballer kicking his pet. Here we look at some of the other people who have faced criticism over their alleged treatment of animals.  At a concert in Des Moines, Iowa in 1982, the Black Sabbath frontman, Ozzy Osbourne, shocked the world when he bit into a bat on stage. He has since said he thought the bat was rubber but quickly realised something was “very wrong” when liquid poured out of it and he felt its head “twitch”. The person who threw the bat was reportedly a 17-year-old fan, who said the animal was dead and had been stolen from his younger brother’s science department. After the show Osbourne was rushed to get rabies and tetanus injections. He attracted global headlines, questions from the city’s mayor and a visit by the local animal control unit. But in recent years Osbourne, 73, has capitalised on the incident, launching a bat toy with a detachable head and even a non-fungible token called CryptoBatz. Mary Bale, from Coventry, became reviled around the world and known as “cat bin woman” after she was captured on CCTV picking up a four-year-old tabby cat Lola during her walk home and depositing her into a wheelie bin in 2010. The cat was trapped for 15 hours until her owners found her the next day. The former bank worker, then 45, described the act, for which she was punished with a £250 fine and ordered to pay a victim surcharge and costs by Coventry magistrates court, as a “split second of misjudgment”. But her act of cruelty attracted newspaper headlines such as “Miaow could she?” In 2013, the 19-year-old pop star Justin Bieber was criticised when his pet capuchin monkey, Mally, was seized by customs officials in Germany during a tour because he did not have the required vaccination and import papers. Bieber was accused of having taken the monkey, who was about 14 weeks old at the time, away from its mother too early. He then failed to reclaim the monkey from a shelter. The heiress Paris Hilton, 40, reportedly received a visit from the Los Angeles department of animal services in 2008 after she revealed she owned 17 dogs. More recently, in 2016, Hilton was criticised by the UN, which said her behaviour was “appalling” after she posted a video of herself with a young orangutan, called Dior, dressed in baby clothes.",News/World news,Humans behaving badly: Kurt Zouma is not alone in alleged animal abuse,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/09/humans-behaving-badly-kurt-zouma-is-not-alone-in-alleged-animal-abuse
2/10/2022,"As the threat of the Omicron wave has receded in England, the government has been quick to move the conversation on to “living with Covid”. It was inevitable that this would mean the eventual lifting of legal restrictions, including the need to self-isolate. But even given the optimistic tone in recent weeks, Boris Johnson’s announcement on Wednesday came sooner than many expected.  While he signalled the scrapping of restrictions in England by 24 February – a month earlier than had originally been planned – he provided no detail. It is unclear whether any specific scientific advice was provided on the impact of the move – none has been published - and some of the latest evidence published by the government’s Sage advisers gives an idea of potential risks. An assessment in mid-January concluded that lifting of plan B measures could result in a return to epidemic growth, “particularly if precautionary behaviour, including testing, decreases as a result of reduced perception of risk”. Since then, case numbers have remained high and on Wednesday figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that in England infection levels rose to one in 19 people in the first week of February. But those figures are not as frightening as they once were. Vaccines and immunity from infection mean that a large surge of cases no longer translates to tens of thousands of deaths. Nevertheless, the Sage analysis points out that another increase could result in “a sustained period of high levels of hospitalisations [that] would have detrimental consequences for the NHS”, at a time when waiting lists are at a record high. As we move out of the crisis phase of the pandemic, it is perhaps also time to recalibrate what we expect from public health policy, beyond simply avoiding large numbers of deaths in the immediate term. Restrictions have to be balanced against the real downsides of self-isolating, but policies should also be evidence-based, coherent and consider the impact on those in vulnerable groups. The latest announcement has left a sense of confusion about how the public will be expected to live out the changes to rules in two weeks’ time. Following the jubilant tone of the announcement regarding people no longer needing to self-isolate, Downing Street later clarified that “in the same way that someone with flu, we wouldn’t recommend they go to work, we would never recommend anyone goes to work when they have an infectious disease”. A substantial proportion of Covid infections are asymptomatic, or mild, though. So as England moves to a new phase, so new questions will have to be faced. Most employers would not expect – or tolerate – people staying off work when suffering from mild cold symptoms. Will they feel the same way about Covid? Will people just need to stay at home as long as they are ill – as with flu? Or will there be a suggested isolation period? And how will the rules apply to NHS staff, who until last week faced being sacked unless they were fully vaccinated? The details are, so far, unclear. There is also continued concern about how the latest policy will affect those in the clinically vulnerable group, for whom Covid remains a more serious threat because their immune systems do not respond as effectively to vaccines. Campaign groups and charities representing those with blood cancer, kidney disease and other immunocompromised people say that while the government has celebrated being able to return people’s freedoms, it has failed to set out plans for how vulnerable groups will be able to return to a normal life, or to ensure that all of these people are able to access fourth vaccine doses and antiviral drugs. The emergence of future variants also remains a possibility, and Sage scientists have repeatedly stressed the need for vigilance. While requirements for individuals to test and isolate may be relaxed, it will be crucial for national surveillance to continue to ensure that there is time to react in the case of new variants.",News/World news,"Covid rules are to be axed in England, but is pandemic’s end really in sight?",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/09/covid-rules-axed-england-is-pandemic-end-really-in-sight
2/10/2022,"Betty Davis, the trailblazing raw funk pioneer of the 1970s who spent decades after a blistering music career out of the spotlight, has died at the age of 77. The vocalist and ex-wife of jazz legend Miles Davis died of natural causes, according to her close friend, Danielle Maggio, an ethnomusicologist focused on Davis’s work, and the Allegheny county communications director, Amie Downs, Rolling Stone reported.  Known for her overtly sexual lyrics and raw, wild voice, Davis was an influential musician and significant figure in New York’s late-60s music scene. Nearly all her catalog was recorded between 1964 and 1975. She cut three albums in the 1970s – 1973’s Betty Davis, 1974’s They Say I’m Different and 1975’s Nasty Gal – which gained her a reputation as a cult hero for explicitness and sensuous carnality years ahead of her time. Born Betty Mabry in Durham, North Carolina, in 1945, Davis grew up in North Carolina and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, before moving to New York at 17 to enroll at the Fashion Institute of Technology. She worked as a model and club manager, mixing in the city’s social scene with such figures as Andy Warhol, Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone and Eric Clapton. But she was most interested in music; she began writing songs at 12 and recording some in the late 60s, catching the eye of Miles Davis. The two married in 1968 and endured a tumultuous, violent year together. “Every day married to him was a day I earned the name Davis,” she says in a 2017 documentary on her life, Betty: They Say I’m Different. She would appear on the cover of the jazz legend’s 1968 album Filles de Kilimanjaro, and served as the inspiration behind his song Mademoiselle Mabry. A close friend of Hendrix, she is also credited with introducing Miles Davis to the rock music of his time and steering him into the jazz fusion era of his career on such albums as 1969’s In a Silent Way and 1970’s Bitches Brew. Though she kept his name, Davis never wanted to operate in her ex-husband’s shadow. “I wanted my music to be taken seriously,” she said later. “I wasn’t going to turn into a Yoko Ono or a Linda McCartney.” Davis recorded her most transgressive work in the 1970s, with carnal lyrics and a lascivious performance style that opened doorways for such artists who openly explored sexuality as Madonna and Prince. As the Guardian’s Stevie Chick put it in 2016, Davis “roared, growled and rasped, her voice like erotic sandpaper, making Janis Joplin sound like Dionne Warwick”. Her work later inspired a new generation of artists, such as Afro-futurist singer Janelle Monae, who has credited Davis as “one of the godmothers of redefining how Black women in music can be viewed” who “opened up a lot of doors for artists like myself.” Neo-soul singer Erykah Badu has said, “We just grains of sand in her Bettyness.” Her music was never commercially successful and Davis abruptly left the music industry after 1975’s Nasty Gal. She moved to Pittsburgh and did not record new music. “When I was told that it was over, I just accepted it,” Davis told the New York Times in 2018. “And nobody else was knocking at my door.” Following the 2017 documentary, Davis released her first song in over 40 years, A Little Bit Hot Tonight, in 2019, sung by Maggio.",Arts/Music,"Betty Davis, raw funk pioneer, dies at 77",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/09/betty-davis-funk-artist-music-dies-77
