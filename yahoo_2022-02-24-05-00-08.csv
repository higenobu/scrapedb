2/24/2022,"LAS VEGAS — A young boy was found dead Tuesday in a freezer at a Las Vegas home after his sister handed her elementary school teacher an alarming note that would prompt a homicide investigation. In the note, the children's mother wrote that her boyfriend was holding her against her will inside their home, according to Las Vegas homicide Lt. Ray Spencer. ""She stated that she didn't know where her younger child was,"" Spencer said of the note's contents, ""and that she believed he was deceased."" The teacher alerted authorities shortly after 8 a.m. Tuesday, prompting a team of Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officers to begin surveilling the family's home in northeast Las Vegas. By 10 a.m., the children's mother and her boyfriend, identified in court records as Brandon Toseland, were seen leaving the house inside a vehicle. 'Come on, I have a family': Pittsburgh Uber driver begged for her life before being killed by rider, police say Nation: Florida woman facing murder charges after allegedly stabbing her husband more than 140 times Police pulled the car over in the neighborhood and detained Toseland, 35, while the woman was interviewed by officers. The woman, who has not been identified, said she had last seen her son on Dec. 11 and described to the officers months of alleged abuse by her boyfriend, Spencer said. ""She said she was not allowed to leave the house alone or go into the garage,"" according to Spencer. Shortly after the traffic stop, Toseland, who is not the father of the children, was arrested and booked into the Clark County Detention Center in downtown Las Vegas on two counts of first-degree kidnapping. Authorities are working to file a murder charge in the case. Toseland is expected to be rebooked into the detention center on Wednesday on the charge. Toseland has a history of arrests in Las Vegas dating back to at least 2005 on charges including domestic battery and disorderly conduct, court records show. In the meantime, Spencer and his team searched the home after securing a search warrant Tuesday afternoon, finding the boy's body in the freezer. The freezer was in the garage, where the woman said she was not allowed to enter. Spencer, who called the case ""such a tragic situation,"" did not release details Tuesday about how the boy may have died. The Clark County coroner's office will identify the child and determine his cause and manner of death. Toseland made his first court appearance on Wednesday. As of Tuesday evening, detectives did not consider the children's mother to be involved in the death. ""But it’s still early on,"" Spencer said, ""and there are a lot of questions that we still have to answer about what occurred over the last three months."" The woman's daughter was placed in the care of relatives on Tuesday.

2/24/2022,"Chinese news media posted instructions to social platforms about how to approach coverage on Ukraine, including a note of China’s need for Russian ""support"" with Taiwan. One outlet appeared to accidentally post guidelines on what should and should not be published, while an editor from another outlet weighed in with guidance on language and approaches that he believed necessary in walking a fine line. Ming Jinwei, senior editor at Xinhua News Agency, wrote in his WeChat blog about how his outlet needed to walk a tight line on its Ukraine coverage, noting that China ""has to back Russia up with emotional and moral support while refraining from treading on the toes of the United States and European Union."" ""In the future, China will also need Russia’s understanding and support when wrestling with America to solve the Taiwan issue once and for all,"" his post read. Ming said that it ""doesn’t hurt"" to use moderately pro-Russia language. PUTIN, IN NEW VIDEO, CALLS RUSSIA'S CORE INTERESTS ‘NON-NEGOTIABLE’ BUT SAYS IT'S OPEN TO ‘HONEST DIALOGUE’ And Horizon News, a social media account belonging to CCP-owned Beijing News, appeared to post similar instructions along with a note that no posts unfavorable to Russia or with pro-Western content should be published. The Horizon News post was later deleted, according to The Washington Post. An amateur translation on Twitter claimed that the post said ""From now on, for Ukraine-related topics, post them on Weibo. All post on Shimian first and then on our major account to promote Shimian. Don't post anything against Russia or pro-west. Let me review your words before posting."" WHO HAS THE BETTER MILITARY TECHNOLOGY: RUSSIA OR US? Hu Xijin, former editor of the state-run Global Times, described Russia’s recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk regions as a measure to ""break the deadlock"" of the crisis in a way that showed ""Russia’s strategic determination."" China and Russia have developed a tighter bond over the past few years – a relationship that has accelerated in the past few months. China only last week accused the United States of ""playing up"" the crisis on Ukraine’s border after Moscow claimed to have pulled back some of its 150,000 troops amassed in the region. RUSSIA-UKRAINE CRISIS – IT'S TIME FOR BIDEN TO SURPRISE PUTIN And the day before Russia’s recognition of the breakaway Ukrainian regions, Moscow and Beijing agreed on a new deal that would see Russia supply 100 million tons of coal to its southern neighbor in a move that could help to mitigate any sanctions enacted by the West. On Tuesday, President Biden announced new sanctions against Russia, citing what he described as ""the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine,"" following reports of Russian troops entering two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine. Robert L. Wilkie, former undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness during the Trump administration and visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, previously told Fox News Digital that China would play a role in mitigating any U.S. sanctions placed on Russia in the event Vladimir Putin authorizes any military action in Ukraine. ""A lot of the talk about economic sanctions is really a pie in the sky because China is now Russia’s banker,"" Wilkie said. ""Xi Jinping will back Putin if sanctions from the West come.""",World/Fox News,"Chinese media accidentally posts CCP rules on Russia-Ukraine coverage, hint at Taiwan takeover",https://news.yahoo.com/chinese-media-accidentally-posts-ccp-151743081.html
