3/22/2022,"Rishi Sunak has been handed a boost from figures showing lower government borrowing than official estimates on the eve of the spring statement, despite a sharp rise in debt interest payments last month amid soaring inflation. The Office for National Statistics said borrowing over the first 11 months of the financial year 2021-22 was £138.4bn, less than half the sum borrowed a year earlier and almost £30bn less than estimated by the Office for Budget Responsibility in October. Helped by resilience in the jobs market after the end of furlough, analysts said the figures could strengthen Sunak’s position at the spring statement to offer tax cuts or additional spending to cushion the blow from soaring living costs. However, the latest snapshot showed a worsening picture for the public finances in February as the budget deficit – the gap between spending and income – came in at £13.1bn, the second-highest borrowing figure for that month since records began in 1993. It comes as soaring inflation pushed up interest payments on government debt by more than 50% to £8.2bn, the highest February figure on record. City economists had forecast a borrowing figure of about £8.1bn for the month. The chancellor is understood to have drawn up a range of options to help with the cost of living crisis – including a 1p cut to income tax, raising the national insurance threshold and a significant cut to fuel duty. However, Sunak may use the February borrowing figures to insist on a more limited approach. Responding to the latest snapshot, he said it was now “more important than ever” to take a responsible approach to the public finances. “With inflation and interest rates still on the rise, it’s crucial that we don’t allow debt to spiral and burden future generations with further debt,” he said. “Look at our record, we have supported people – and our fiscal rules mean we have helped households while also investing in the economy for the longer term.” James Smith, the research director at the Resolution Foundation, said Sunak needed to take the opportunity to provide emergency support to families. “The chancellor will approach the UK’s latest crisis – the tightest income squeeze in generations, exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine – with the public finances in better shape than expected, increasing the chance of significant policy action to support families through the tough year ahead,” he said. Despite the hit from higher debt servicing costs, the recent sharp rise for inflation is expected to have some benefits for the public purse. Government income from fuel duty and VAT on energy bills has increased over the past year, while Sunak’s plan to freeze the income tax personal allowance and higher rate threshold over four years is expected to generate £21bn – more than double the amount budgeted for due to rising inflation, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Despite the highest rates of inflation since the early 1990s, the government’s debt servicing costs remain low compared to recent decades as a proportion of national income.",News/Business,Rishi Sunak handed borrowing boost before spring statement ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/22/rishi-sunak-borrowing-spring-statement-fuel-duty-tax-inflation

3/22/2022,"Bayern Munich ended Wolfsburg’s four-year stranglehold on the German league title last season. The team’s route to the Champions League quarter-finals was straightforward, but a surprise 0-0 draw with Benfica prevented the German champions from topping Group D ahead of seven-time Champions League winners Lyon. Former Lyon midfielder Saki Kumagai helped the German side to a 1-0 home win against Lyon and the team’s only defeat of the group stage was a 2-1 defeat in the reverse fixture. To reach this tie, PSG emerged from the weakest group in this season’s competition with six wins from six, 25 goals and 13 different goalscorers. Both teams have lived in the shadows of their domestic rivals in the Champions League, but last season PSG knocked out Lyon and Bayern reached the semi-finals while Wolfsburg exited at the quarter finals stage. Verdict: Paris St-Germain The tie of the round on paper will probably be less exciting on the pitch. Champions League holders Barcelona are 19 points clear at the top of the Primera División, having scored 136 goals in 24 games without dropping a point. Their record in Europe this season is just as formidable, with 24 goals in six group games and just one conceded – that in a 4-1 home win over Arsenal. Real Madrid, meanwhile, are struggling domestically. Very much in their infancy, with the women’s team acquired in 2019 and rebranded from CD Tacón in 2020, Real sit fifth in the league, two points behind Granadilla Tenerife but with a game in hand over all the teams above. Barcelona have beaten Real each time the two teams have met; most recently the Ballon d’Or winner, Alexia Putellas, scored twice in a 5-0 win for the Catalans. Most exciting will be the attendance for the second leg at the sold-out Camp Nou, where Barcelona’s women’s team are playing for the first time. Verdict: Barcelona Juve surprised in the group stage when they secured a 0-0 draw at Chelsea’s Kingsmeadow and took four points off Wolfsburg to secure second place in the group of death and earn progression at the expense of Emma Hayes’s side. Juventus had been flying in Serie A with a five-point lead over second-placed Roma, but have won only two of their last five games. Having previously failed to progress beyond the round of 32 in this competition, this is the Italian side’s best run in their short history. Up next, though, are seven-times champions Lyon. The Ligue 1 leaders are on a mission to reclaim multiple crowns after a rare trophyless season in 2020-21. The only blip the team suffered in Group D was a 1-0 away defeat to Bayern Munich. They are benefiting from the return of the competition’s all-time top scorer Ada Hegerberg, who had to sit out much of last season with an anterior cruciate ligament injury. Verdict: Lyon Arsenal crept out of Group C in second place with a superior head-to-head goal difference over third-placed Hoffenheim. The Gunners suffered two bruising defeats to reigning champions Barcelona, 4-1 away and 4-0 at the Emirates, and staggered to the quarter-finals after a 4-1 loss to Hoffenheim. After back-to-back defeats in the delayed 2021 FA Cup final to Chelsea and then to Barcelona in December, Arsenal’s season looked to be unravelling with three defeats in their next four games. Since then, however, the ship has been steadied and reinforcements were pulled aboard in January. Wolfsburg are a tricky test though. They emerged from the group of death on top, based on head-to-head goal difference with both Chelsea and Juventus. The two-time Champions League winners know what it takes to progress in the latter stages, having reached the final in five of eight years in the competition, including finishing as runners-up to Lyon in the 2019-20 final. Arsenal certainly have a team capable of reaching the last four, but the experience of the German side could be decisive.

3/22/2022,"Expect something on Wednesday, some gesture in the spring statement to ease the gathering cost-of-living storm. But for whom? That’s the chancellor’s political and moral choice. But, before he chooses, I would like to bring him with me to sit in court to watch a day of housing evictions, warrants and repossessions. Since the ban on evictions in England during Covid ended last summer, a wave of cases has surged through the justice system. Here Rishi Sunak would see stricken households losing their daily battle to stay afloat in a sea of bills and misfortunes. Many were knocked into debt by lost earnings in the pandemic, struggling against mounting bills. Many were “just about managing” with the £20 a week “uplift” to universal credit, before that was cruelly withdrawn. In Watford county court, Hertfordshire, some of them find their last hope in Ruth Camp, a duty solicitor and housing specialist who works for Shelter, the housing charity. They spill out their story briefly to her before they go into the courtroom, where she argues their case before the judge, doing the best she can on the day. Some tenants, having already given up in despair, never even turn up. Often she does win adjournments and delays, finding technical errors in landlords’ paperwork or gaining a legal “breathing space” for those with mental health problems. Years of legal aid cuts have left just one law firm still taking housing cases in all of Hertfordshire, she says, while landlords often have barristers. The usher says no reporters ever come here. I’d like the chancellor to meet Adele, who has fallen asleep in the foyer queueing for Camp’s help. She has already been evicted by bailiffs, but all her possessions, including, crucially, her ID, are locked in the flat – she can’t get benefits or anywhere else to rent without it. She had lived there for nine years with her brother, until both lost work during Covid and fell behind with their rent. Or how about Michael, who has taken the day off his chemotherapy for throat cancer to attend court? His arrears are huge, as he says his benefits got stopped. Why? He rambles, a bit confused, and has brought a heap of documents, including photos of black mould in his sitting room. “I’ve tried over 40 flats, but no landlord will take me,” he says, knowing eviction is inevitable. The judge tries his best but has no discretion in granting the landlord possession within 28 days. Camp writes everything down for Michael, tells him to go to Citizens Advice about his benefits and the council’s homelessness prevention team, but, she says, hard-pressed councils keep raising their criteria for help of any kind. If some tenants seem disorganised, maybe the typical Tory minister would brand them feckless, but in hard times those in the frailest mental state fall under the wheels first. Some are just unlucky – like Kingston, an assistant plumber, who tells me that in his 20 years since leaving the Caribbean: “I paid tax and stamp, took no benefits, never been in debt in my whole life.” But work was scarce during the worst of the pandemic and now he’s been in hospital. Working on a zero-hours contract for an agency, he got no sick pay, so he’s in arrears and his landlord wants him out. Camp bargains with the judge to reduce his repayment rate. “He can’t pay it off that fast, with the cost-of-living rising,” she warns. Housing associations can be as tough as private landlords. “We’re a charity, we can’t afford arrears,” one argues – but the judge negotiates a last chance to repay. The chancellor really should meet Esther, so resourceful and resilient that she leaves Camp and me full of admiration. She’s a widow with children who has already been served with a warrant for eviction. Her landlord does no repairs, so she taught herself on YouTube to plumb in a new toilet. Her budgeting is tuned to the last penny. “We buy 20p pasta packs, cheap packed lunches, no school dinners. We’ve stopped wifi, my boy’s football club and my girl’s bus pass,” she says: all that with no breath of self-pity. She works in hospitality and barely earns above the minimum wage. She glows with pride at her daughter, who has just been accepted into university, but her debt problems started when she had to pay for her mother’s funeral. When Camp assesses her bills, the scale of the problem is apparent, especially now that crucial £20 week has been lost from universal credit. The judge lets her repay a bit less, but warns he can’t stop an eviction from taking place if she falls behind in the onslaught of price rises ahead. One landlord came to court accompanied by an incandescent father, who shouted at Camp after the case: “Shelter! You’re a disgrace: you should be ashamed!” Finding a technical error, Camp had won a stay for an agoraphobic tenant in high arrears. But usually the boot is firmly on the landlord’s foot. Official figures show a 43% rise in evictions in the three months to December in England on the previous three months, with Shelter reporting that 275,000 privately rented households had received an eviction notice or were behind on their rent. A landlord can evict a tenant with two months’ notice for no reason at all. Of Camp’s 30 cases that day, she says, 10 evictions went ahead. But, even for those cases where she won a respite, many would still end with the bailiff’s knock. Since the great austerity axe fell on the welfare state, charities such as Shelter and Citizens Advice can be all that’s left to defend destitute people; the Department for Work and Pensions can be worse than no help, and social workers are stretched to life-and-death cases only. On Wednesday, the chancellor chooses how to spend a windfall of £9bn from better than expected tax income, as the Bank of England warns of the deepest fall in living standards since modern records began. His backbenchers clamour for popular cuts to petrol duties and taxes for all voters. But if he took the moral course and directed £9bn to keeping benefits up with inflation, then, says the Resolution Foundation, three-quarters of his assistance would be well-targeted on the lower earners in most need. If he does nothing to stop benefits falling, low earners such as Esther will be losing a colossal 14% of their real income to rising prices, according to the political economist Richard Murphy, analysing official figures. Barring a miracle, that means she would fall behind with rent and lose her home. Would the chancellor look her in the eye and tell her that? Esther probably shouldn’t hold her breath. It doesn’t take much political tea-leaf reading to guess who this Tory chancellor will spend most money on pleasing.

3/22/2022,"Let’s be honest, King Richard is nowhere near being a favourite for best picture. Some would even suggest an unpretentious sports biopic like this doesn’t even belong at the awards top table. But isn’t that what they said about Venus and Serena Williams? King Richard is an underdog movie about underdogs, and if the notion of the lowly outsider overcoming daunting odds sounds too Hollywood to swallow, well tough: this actually happened. Richard Williams’ story is absurdly improbable, on the face of it: a working-class Black man from Compton, Los Angeles, who decides he is going to coach his two daughters to become world-beating tennis players before they are even born, and writes an 85-page plan for how to achieve it. Needless to say, the pro tennis world laughs in his face. “You’re asking me to believe you have the next two Mozarts living in your house.” But of course, Williams does achieve his goal, and if the conclusion of this story is not exactly a cliffhanger, King Richard at least departs from the standard “everything depends on the big game” sports-movie formula, and gets into the psychology of this unique family. An icon himself, Will Smith has to work hard to embody a potential loser, but this is his best dramatic performance to date. It’s quite a transformation: greying, stooping, weary and pained – nobody would mistake King Richard for a Fresh Prince. He’s a curious mix of humility and resolve, of compassion and stubbornness. He is unwavering in his conviction, and relentless in instilling self-belief in his daughters. Not everyone agrees with his approach: the Williams sisters themselves (Saniyya Sidney and Demi Singleton) seem remarkably compliant much of the time, but some of the movie’s best scenes are Richard’s exchanges with his wife Oracene (Aunjanue Ellis on excellent form), who presents a robust challenge to his tyrannical reign. Race is inevitably a factor here, and the white-dominated world of tennis throws American prejudice into stark relief, not least the way in which Black talent is dismissed by white outsiders until it becomes potentially exploitable. As the Williams sisters’ brilliance on the court emerges, the way in which the attitudes of white coaches, agents, and sponsors switch from snooty condescension to strategic grovelling is a dynamic only a movie like this can illustrate. When a coach insists to Richard that the sisters have only a tiny window of time in which to turn professional, he replies: “Peoples like us, we get shot when we go through those.” As counterbalance to these serious themes, King Richard smartly brings in a comedy wildcard half-way through, in the form of Jon Bernthal. As the sisters’ coach Rick Macci, he’s everything their daddy isn’t: cheerful, friendly, irrepressibly perky. Inevitably, he and Richard don’t always see eye to eye but he’s just what the story needs to pep it up. You could well complain that King Richard is too generous towards its central figure, just as you could argue that the Williams sisters themselves deserve the real credit for their success, but Venus and Serena are the co-producers of the movie (along with Smith), and this is the story they wanted to tell. It is as much a story about parenting achievement as sporting achievement, which is far more useful to the wider world. Yes, it might be buffed by the rosy glow of hindsight and a little on-the-nose at times, but King Richard is too specific in its detail to devolve into cliche. It is an American dream that actually came true.",Arts/Film,Why King Richard should win the best picture Oscar,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/22/why-king-richard-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar
3/22/2022,"The new head of the defence force’s space command says she is “scared” by the activities of China and Russia and concerned by Australia’s current inability to combat those threats. Air vice-marshal Cath Roberts on Tuesday warned that a Beijing-controlled satellite could, for example, easily “take out the NBN for [regional] Australia”. Roberts initially started with a quip when asked on Tuesday which adversaries scared her the most. “Well, it’s not Darth Vader, but I do watch a lot of science fiction,” said Roberts, who is the commander of the new space division established within the air force. “[But] the activities by China and Russia, which have been fairly well documented in the public domain, scare me. I think our lack of capability at the moment against those threats … that is concerning.” Roberts, who is based at Fairbairn in Canberra and is leading a team of 105 people, added “we are really tight with the US” and “we can rely on them to an extent but we need to accelerate the capability so that we can deal with the threats”. Part of her role, according to a document released on Tuesday, is to “increase the national understanding” of the threats in space. Roberts said China’s SJ-21 satellite towed another Chinese navigation satellite “out of orbit and into a graveyard orbit” in January – raising concerns about Beijing’s capability to disrupt vital communications satellites. “What do we have in geosynchronous orbit that is important for Australia? Well, we have Optus C1, which is all of our satellite communications, and we also have Sky Muster, which is our NBN feed for the country and all the remote areas. “That Chinese satellite, which drifts around, and we watch it, can actually just, you know, if it decided to, take out the NBN for [regional] Australia.” Roberts said space was “contested and congested and there are threats”. “We need to be able to protect our assets in space, otherwise it would change Australia’s way of life,” she said. Roberts said her team would investigate Australia having the capability to generate “reversible and irreversible effects” on objects in space, such as “jamming” satellite communications, without creating debris. In a speech to a conference in Canberra on Tuesday, the defence minister, Peter Dutton, insisted space must not become “a new realm for conflict”. Dutton cited an anti-satellite missile test in November 2021 when Russia “destroyed its own redundant Cosmos 1408, which left behind a cloud of more than 1,500 pieces of lethal debris that will take decades to clear”. At the time, the head of Nasa described the test as a threat to the safety of seven astronauts onboard the International Space Station, but the Russian military said it was aimed at boosting the country’s defensive capabilities and denied the fragments were dangerous. At a media briefing on the sidelines of the air force-organised conference on Tuesday, Roberts said it has not yet been clearly defined whether towing or disabling a satellite would be considered an act of war. “What is the line that takes you from competition to conflict? And if they did, you know, take one of our satellites out of geostationary orbit, is that a conflict? That has not happened in space yet. So we have to work through those red lines.” Air commodore Nicholas Hogan, who join the space command as the director general of space capability, raised concerns that the lack of established norms or laws in space created a “wild west” scenario. Hogan said it was worth considering the response if the Russian anti-satellite test in November had occurred on the land or in the sea or air. “If another country created such a lasting impact on one of those domains for 10-plus years, what do you think our reaction would be?” The commander of the US Space Command, Army General James Dickinson, told reporters in Canberra: “What we’ve seen over the last few years is really an increase in trackable pieces of debris that we look at each and every day. I think today we’re up to close to 44,000 objects that we track, and in having an event like that just adds more to that problem.” Dickinson also described China as “our pacing threat” and said “we’re watching very closely” but wouldn’t comment on whether the US has similar capabilities. He said the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, has issued him with five tenets of responsible space behaviour, including limiting the creation of long-lasting space debris. Dr Cassandra Steer, a space law and policy expert from the Australian National University warned against “accelerating a global strategic race to the bottom”. “We are already in a security dilemma in space: as each greater power points the finger at the other for threatening the space environment, in response the other great powers ramp up their own space military programs, and we find ourselves in an upward spiral towards a less stable, more risky space environment,” Steer said. Steer said Russia and China saw the very existence of the US space force to be a threat. In addition to the Russian anti-satellite weapon test in November last year, she cited previous tests by China (2007), the US (2008) and India (2019). While Steer believes Australia needs a space command and a space strategy, she also said Australia must be “very conscious of the policy positions and statements we make”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Together with the UK, Japan, Canada, NZ, Germany, France and others, we should be advocating for responsible behaviours in space, and a return to strategic restraint,” Steer said. “We cannot afford to have space become a theatre of war.” While Dutton appeared to keep the door open to a US-style space force in the future, Steer said Australia did not have the size nor the technological capability to build a separate force. “We don’t need to do a copy-cat of our largest ally,” Steer said. “Space command, and even US space force, is about technological capabilities in space to support terrestrial military operations, and to protect space systems. That doesn’t need ‘boots on the moon’ or even people in space. To talk about an Australian space force is misplaced, and potentially an escalatory statement.” On Tuesday, the defence department revealed space command’s logo, together with the slogan “the ultimate high ground”. These attracted some mirth online, but were perhaps not as contentious as the logo for the space force launched by the former US president Donald Trump in 2019. Defence has earmarked plans to invest $7bn in space capabilities over the next 10 years – spending that has been supported by the opposition in the lead-up to the federal election due in May. That includes a tender known as JP 9102, with a winning bidder expected to be announced this year, to deliver at least two, and as many as four, military communication satellites. Roberts said she wanted that capability to be achieved urgently, amid concerns Australia is “so far behind” in its awareness of the space domain. “We need to be able to deliver and contribute space capability a lot faster than was planned in the integrated investment plan.”",News/Australia news,China could ‘take out’ Australian satellites says new head of Defence’s space command,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/22/china-could-take-out-australian-satellites-says-new-head-of-defences-space-command
3/22/2022,"A 22-year-old man has been charged with the murder of teenager Sabita Thanwani, who was found dead at student accommodation in London. Maher Maaroufe, 22, of no fixed address, has been charged with 19-year-old Thanwani’s murder as well as assaulting an emergency worker, the Metropolitan police said. Maaroufe, a Tunisian national, who is not a student, will appear at Highbury Corner magistrates court on Tuesday. Police officers were called to Arbour House in Sebastian Street in central London at about 5am on Saturday, where Thanwani, who was studying psychology at City University, was found suffering serious injuries. She was pronounced dead at the scene. A postmortem examination carried out at the Whittington hospital, north London, on Monday gave the cause of death as sharp force trauma to the neck. On Monday, Thanwani’s family paid tribute to her, adding they pray that “there will come a day when girls and women are safe”. In a statement issued through police, they described the 19-year-old as “an angel” who “was pure and did not see bad in anyone”. “Sabita Thanwani was our daughter. Our angel,” they said. “Her life, that we hoped would be long, was cut tragically short.

3/22/2022,"The Syrian regime is setting up shell companies in a systematic attempt to avoid sanctions, according to official documents obtained by the Guardian. The documents, not publicly available, detail at least three companies established in Syria on the same day with the explicit purpose of operating as a shell to buy shares and manage other companies. They show clear links between the owners of the new shell companies, President Bashar al-Assad and Syria’s economically powerful elite, including individuals under sanction. Complicating the ownership structure of businesses in Syria increases the complexity in untangling the role they have in bolstering the regime’s finances and makes it more difficult for foreign powers to impose sanctions effectively on the government’s inner circle. Last October, Syria’s economy minister, Muhammad Samer al-Khalil, said that “evading sanctions has become a Syrian craft,” and called on foreign investors reluctant to join the market because of sanctions “not to appear under their true names in the local market”. Each of the new shell companies, established in October 2021 – Trappist, Generous and Super Brandy – is majority owned by an individual linked to the Syrian regime by an intricate web of connections. Eyad Hamid, a senior researcher at the London-based Syrian Legal Development Program, said: “It is important [to continue to track shell companies] as it is part of the asset freeze and drying-up of resources the regime is using to violate human rights in Syria.” Justine Walker, head of global sanctions at the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists, said governments did not have to wait for shell companies to start buying shares or moving money before imposing sanctions on them. “Part of [sanctions] is to ensure a company doesn’t continue operations and isn’t able to set up [in the first place],” she said. One of the three owners of the new shell companies is Ali Najib Ibrahim, who is a co-owner of Tele Space, a firm that part-owns Wafa JSC, which was licensed in early 2022 to become the country’s third telecom operator. Another part-owner of Wafa JSC is Yasar Hussein Ibrahim (also known as Yasser Hussein Ibrahim), an adviser to Assad and head of the economic and financial office of the presidency, and under sanctions imposed by the US and the UK. The other two figures who own the new shell companies are Rana Ahmad Khalil, 20, and Rita Ahmad Khalil, 21. They are the daughters of Ahmad Khalil Khalil, who half owns Tele Space, in partnership with Ali Najib Ibrahim. Ahmad Khalil Khalil is also co-owner of Sanad Protection and Security Services, which is in charge of protecting Russian phosphate shipments from central Syria to Tartus port. His partner in Sanad Protection is Nasser Deeb Deeb, co-owner of Ella Services – and under sanctions imposed by the US – with Khodr Ali Taher, a leading businessman for the Assad regime. Taher, who has also had sanctions imposed by the US, UK and EU for bankrolling the regime and his involvement in smuggling and profiteering, is reportedly implicated as a smuggler of captagon – a type of locally made amphetamine. The criminal network the Syrian regime uses to evade sanctions and to keep the country’s illicit economy functioning to continue is outrunning any updates by western governments. Hamid said: “The new [Biden] administration’s sanctions have been very limited and, in a way, they do not have the appetite that was in the previous administration to impose sanctions on individuals in Syria.” The same also applies to the UK government, which has only announced one fresh round of sanctions since leaving the EU. The sanctions targeted close allies of Assad, including Yasar Hussein Ibrahim in 2021 and Syria’s foreign minister, Faisal Mekdad. The US Office of Foreign Assets Control, the enforcement agency of the US Treasury, has also imposed sanctions on Ibrahim and Taher. Peter Stano, of the EU’s foreign affairs department, said developments in Syria were kept under constant review. “[The EU] has shown … that it is responsive in deciding to renew sanctions and/or amend the list of targeted entities or persons based on developments on the ground,” Stano said. The EU Commission said it would pass on information the Guardian had published to “the relevant competent authority for assessment and, if needed, further investigations”. The US’s so-called Caesar Act – named after a whistleblower in the Syrian security services who documented the Assad regime’s use of torture – allows for secondary sanctions to be imposed on individuals and businesses connected to the regime even if they did not commit sanctionable behaviour. However, such sanctions have not been applied since the act went into effect in mid-2020. Walker said: “If you can imagine how many companies are set up in Syria, it’s outside of the bandwidth of governments … [therefore] investigation specialists [and] due-diligence providers … play a very crucial role.” Hamid added: “There needs to be more investment, investigations and on-the-ground sources to keep up with these changes in the Syrian business scene because it’s not a stable environment, it keeps shifting.”  Karam Shaar is research director at the Operations & Policy Center (OPC) and Syria programme manager at the Observatory of Political and Economic Networks",News/Global development,Syria using maze of shell companies to avoid sanctions on Assad regime’s elite ,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/22/syria-using-maze-of-shell-companies-to-avoid-sanctions-on-assad-regimes-elite
