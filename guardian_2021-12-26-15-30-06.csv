12/26/2021,"So how was it for you? 2021? It was an odd year at the plot. Old winter crops left to flower into summer. Brassicas towering. Gastropods feasting. Almost a glimpse into a post-apocalyptic gardening world. I grew to love the wild abandon. Grasses seeding, blowing in the wind (though we might come to regret some of this later). Flower beds left to live a fuller life. I couldn’t help but save some seed.  Howard and Rose grew a memorial plot to Rose’s grandmother. A shaded spot. Making a virtue out of austerity. Highlight for me there, the overwintered chicory flowering sky-blue deep into autumn. We had height like never before. Self-seeding fennel largely left to its own devices, yellow heads dancing. Tall Verbena bonariensis, beloved by butterflies, from shoots on a neighbouring plot. Lasting into November, until torn to the ground by clambering nasturtiums, roped like mustangs. And what a year for nasturtiums. Feral in creams, oranges, rusts and reds. Purest tagetes Ildkongen, too, refreshed with new stock from Signe (copenhagenseeds.dk). Sprawling scarlet bushes, tall and confident. Self-seeding amaranth (Hopi Red Dye) and orache spread and added extra height. What about vegetables you might ask? Tear peas were disappointing. We may have to search for new stock, though as yet we will trial to see if it was the year, the strange season, or the seed. It was slightly the same story with climbing beans, though we will have to hunt for more Gold of Bacau. Howard has a plan. There was chard, chervil, some parsley, too. But it was a year for flowers. For colour, for beauty. All largely left to go to seed. Most we saved for next summer. There are trays and paper bags and envelopes on shelves throughout the house. Full of hope for a brighter and better year. As the year shudders to a stop, from Howard and Rose, Mary and me, wishing you all a happy, healthy 2022.

12/26/2021,"You don’t have to look far to find evidence of Wada’s centuries-old connection to whaling. Visitors to the town on Japan’s Pacific coast are greeted by a replica skeleton of a blue whale before entering a museum devoted to the behemoths of the ocean. At a local restaurant, diners eat deep-fried whale cutlet and buy cetacean-themed gifts at a neighbouring gift shop. At the edge of the water stands a wooden deck where harpooned whales are butchered before being sold to wholesalers and restaurants.  In 2019, when Japan withdrew from the International Whaling Commission (IWC) – the body that had effectively banned whaling in the late 1980s – Wada rejoiced at the prospect of a return to commercial hunting and at a popular reconnection with a source of food that had sustained coastal communities for 400 years. But here and in other whaling towns in Japan, the resumption of killing whales for profit for the first time in more than three decades has offered little cause for celebration. While condemnation from conservation groups has eased in the three years since Japan’s fleet exited the Antarctic, the country’s whalers face other obstacles: ageing fishermen and vessels, mysterious changes in cetacean behaviour possibly linked to climate change, and a stubborn refusal among Japanese people to eat enough whale meat to make killing them a profitable venture. While Japan skirted the IWC ban by conducting limited “scientific” hunts in the Antarctic, it had long argued that only a return to commercial whaling would guarantee a stable supply of affordable meat and ignite a revival in consumption. “But all the evidence points in the opposite direction,” says Patrick Ramage, senior director for outreach and programme collaboration at the International Fund for Animal Welfare. “Whether pursued on the high seas under the pretext of science or in coastal waters in pursuit of profit, Japan’s commercial whaling is an economic loser, kept afloat only by government subsidies.” Ramage believes the future of Japan’s ageing whaling towns rests on embracing ecotourism. “Whale-watching is making growing contributions to local economies around the world, particularly in locations previously involved in whaling. It’s better to have tourists paying to see whales than taxpayers paying to keep whaling on life support.” Barely 300 people in Japan are directly connected to whaling, while whale made up only about 0.1% of the country’s total meat consumption in 2016, according to government data. About 4-5,000 tonnes of whale meat enter the domestic market every year – the equivalent in volume of about half an apple for every person. But Yoshinori Shoji, the president of the Gaibo Hogei, a whaling company in Wada, said abandoning coastal hunting was unthinkable. “I know it is controversial in other parts of the world, but for us, whales are simply a source of food,” said Shoji, whose company has been processing whale meat for more than 70 years. To keep the town’s whaling culture alive, whale meat is served twice a year at local primary schools and children are invited to watch workers flense Baird’s beaked whales after they have been harpooned and dragged ashore, where they are left intact for 18 hours to allow their meat to mature. “Why shouldn’t we eat whale meat?” says Shoji. “Humans have always eaten local wildlife. It depends on the surrounding environment. My job is to give people the chance to eat and appreciate locally caught whale meat. We’re not forcing anyone to eat it.” He displays hunks of frozen meat and blubber, some of which is sent to Japan’s north-east coast where it is made into soup. On the roof of his factory, slices of Baird’s beaked whale blacken beneath the winter sun before being sold as a local delicacy reminiscent of beef jerky. But Wada’s 30 whale-industry employees are struggling. During last year’s April-October season, they caught just nine whales and have harpooned the same number so far this year. Shoji believes warmer seas may have sent the whales farther north, while more frequent powerful typhoons have confined the town’s two whaling boats to port for days on end. Japan’s commercial whaling industry would grind to a halt without government subsidies of ¥5.1bn (£.033bn) a year, says Junko Sakuma, a freelance journalist and expert on Japan’s whaling economy. “The government has said that it can’t continue to subside what is supposed to be a commercial concern for ever,” she says. “When Japan left the IWC, fisheries officials thought they would be able to catch as many whales as they needed to sustain the industry, but in fact it has shrunk. Japanese whaling will continue, but in a much smaller form.” Paradoxically, the end of “scientific” whaling and the Japanese fleet’s annual clashes with the anti-whaling organisation Sea Shepherd may be hastening whaling’s decline. “In the past, Japanese people were defensive because they didn’t like white people telling them not to eat whale meat,” Sakuma says. “But whaling is barely mentioned these days by anti-whaling countries like Australia, Britain and the US. Now Japanese people have nothing to rebel against, so they could end up just forgetting about whale meat.”",News/World news,Japan’s whaling town struggles to keep 400 years of tradition alive,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/26/japans-whaling-town-struggles-to-keep-400-years-of-tradition-alive
12/26/2021,"Tesco Finest Premier Cru Champagne, France NV (£21, Tesco) As I’ve written in these pages before, t This is a golden age for sparkling wine and the choices for giving 2022 a sparkling welcome are more appealing and diverse than they’ve ever been. Let’s start with some of the cheaper options. If you like your fizz with r a little sweetness and gentle foaminess, a prosecco-alike from near Bologna, such as Taste the Difference Pignoletto Vino Spumante Brut NV (£9, Sainsbury’s), or, even better, the apple-snow light fluffiness of the Languedoc’s Antech Blanquette de Limoux Méthode Ancestrale NV (£10, thewinesociety.com) are both good candidates for midnight on Friday. For something drier, but still in that circa-£10 spot, Marks & Spencer’s Cava Prestige Brut NV (£10) is a wine of real depth and character, while Jansz Premium Cuvée NV is a bright, toasty example of the pristine Tasmanian fizz style at a very good 20%-off price (£14.39 until 2 January, Waitrose). Tesco’s stylish, creamy Premier Cru is my pick of this year’s crop of supermarket own-label champagnes. Bollinger Rosé Brut, Champagne, France NV (£28, 37.5cl, Waitrose) England’s sparkling wine producers haven’t had a particularly good year in the vineyard (it’s been a vintage to remind everyone that this country is still on the northern fringe of winemaking possibility). But the sparkling wines available to buy continue to win friends and awards. Among my favourites this year were the immaculate range from the exponentially improving Rathfinny vineyard in the South Downs in East Sussex (including the impeccable Classic Cuvée Brut 2017, from £28.95, robersonwine.com, leaandsandeman.co.uk) and the briskly stylish Bride Valley Blanc de Blancs 2017 (£38, Waitrose), a slightly bittersweet choice since it comes from the Dorset estate of the debonair wine writer Steven Spurrier, who died earlier this year. With large parties rather unlikely, a half-bottle, such as Bollinger’s typically rich and savoury rosé, is just right for two, and works very well with food. As indeed can the same producer’s La Grande Année Rosé 2012 (£110, Waitrose), a superbly complex wine from a great vintage for blowing any savings you’ve made from missing that expensive NYE night out.  Kleine Zalze Project Z Sweet Fortified, Coastal Region, South Africa NV (from £24.40, handford.net; harrogatefinewinecompany.com) Contrary to every single marketing message and supermarket inducement to the contrary, there is in fact no law stipulating that all wines consumed on the strike of midnight – or at any other celebration – must be filled with bubbles. This, after all, is a late-night occasion, and sparkling wine is very rarely at its best after a meal or a night of other drinks. My own preference when the time comes is often for something richer and calmer – more suited to reflection – than the frenetic energy of fizz. Certainly, there’s something to be said for toasting the end of another weird and, for many of us, very difficult year with something a little cosier and sweeter, but no less special. The ideal – the dream! – would be the astonishing spice-cupboard and exotic fruit complexity and startling Atlantic Ocean freshness and intensity of the great fortified Barbeito Malvasia 20 Year Old Madeira (£175, oxfordwine.co.uk). More realistically, a glass of Kleine Zalze’s fine, filigreed, floral-perfumed and graceful Project Z would also help me to start 2022 in my desired state of blissful enchantment.

12/26/2021,"It was the year we craved the normality of a meal out, regardless of how abnormal an experience it might have to be for that to happen. No matter that the waiters might be masked up or the tables dotted across the room as if set for an interrogation, or that there could be screens between those tables. If the essentials were present – a list of dishes that you hadn’t cooked yourself, someone to fetch them, a pass on the washing up – many of us were there for it. At times it felt as if all of us customers and staff alike, were working very hard to share that delusion of normality. But 2021 was not normal. I began mine by combing my bookshelves for satisfying cookbooks with which to fill a restaurant column when all the restaurants were closed. I reacquainted myself with the brilliance of great recipe writers and cooks such as Claudia Roden, Simon Hopkinson and the late Gary Rhodes. The latter finally taught me to swallow my shame and learn how to make custard from scratch. Custard vanquished; life skill achieved. Thank you, Gary. You may no longer be here, but you held my hand from beyond the grave.  When the time finally came, I grabbed the opportunity to get out of my own kitchen like an A-level student galloping from the exam hall after the final paper. I made a list of the past year’s top restaurant experiences recently and the first three that came to mind were all outside London. I loved the butch, gutsy cooking at the Double Red Duke in Oxfordshire, with its glossily sauced devilled kidneys and its fat scallops under drifts of garlicky crumbs. The sunlit early evening I spent at Sonny Stores in Bristol, sweeping the fattest of salted anchovies on to crusty bread, and demolishing a plate of perfect meringues with white peaches will stay with me for a very long time. And then there was the tiny menu at Erst in Manchester, which delivered so much more than it promised: bubbled and blistered flatbreads swamped with garlic butter; steak tartare under a shouty tonnato sauce; a bay panna cotta that melted away on the tongue. In an age when holding polarised opinions has become a spectator sport, someone somewhere will now extrapolate from this that all restaurants in London are therefore awful. Obviously not. The dish that I got the most correspondence about was the golden carb and dairy fat wonder of a double XL triple cheese toastie served to me at the Wigmore. People exchanged photographs of theirs on social media, like tourists proving they too had visited Angkor Wat on their holidays. Only it was an Angkor Wat crafted out of toasted sourdough, Ogleshield, raclette and Montgomery cheddar. Elsewhere in the capital I was thrilled by the intense nerdiness of Humble Chicken where many specific parts of the bird were carefully grilled on sticks over burning coals. Oh, that line of parsons’ noses. Honourable mentions must also go to the bravery of the Dirik brothers at Mangal 2 who have broken from the traditions of the many Turkish grill houses around them in Dalston, to serve something a little more subtle and, in its own curious way, Scandi. And then there’s the extraordinary bespoke sushi experience that Chris Restrepo narrated his way through at Kurisu Omakase, operating out of his parent’s café in Brixton. I do so love dinner and a show. But if you want stupidity in the restaurant sector, if you want a business proposition that will make your eyes roll so aggressively your neighbours will be able to hear the friction of ball against socket, the capital is still guaranteed to deliver. It speaks volumes about what truly dreadful people you all are, that when I finally broke my self-imposed ban on negative reviews by dismembering the pop-up Polo Lounge on the rooftop of the Dorchester Hotel on London’s Park Lane, it became my most read review of the year online. They deserved it for marking up bog standard wines by a factor of six or seven, and charging £38 for a McCarthy salad that looked like someone had been trying to colour code vegetables as part of a middle management away-day bonding exercise. The second most read review online? It had to be my stupid stunt outside Salt Bae’s Nusr-et Steakhouse in Knightsbridge, during which I declined a hyper expensive gold leaf-wrapped steak in favour of a takeaway from the marvellous Kebab Kid. I will admit I did feel a bit of an arse sitting at a picnic table on the pavement outside, but not as much of an arse, I venture, as all those people who are still going there for £1,000 gold leaf-wrapped steaks even though dear Salt Bae – that’s Mr Bae to you – flew out of London weeks ago, presumably sprinkling various seasonings from his private jet while howling with laughter. Of course, while I swanned around from one table to the next putting my back into the arduous business of eating my tea, life for the restaurants themselves has been rather less dreamy. Many reopened after the lockdown to find that staff they depended upon simply weren’t there any more. Some had re-evaluated what they wanted from life during the pandemic and concluded that a tough job in hospitality wasn’t it. Others were EU citizens who had simply gone home. When I pointed out in a recent review that this was forcing restaurants to shorten their opening hours and blamed this squarely on Brexit, a number of people argued this was a positive. It meant people were no longer willing to work for what were too often the lousy wages offered by hospitality. While I don’t think that negates any of the arguments against the utter bollocks of Brexit, they do have a point. Each week commenters on my reviews online compare the prices in British restaurants unfavourably to those in, say, rural Thailand or Ukraine, while failing to acknowledge the differences between the economies. Those comparisons are pointless. Running a British restaurant is expensive and this past year has shown us just how shaky the sector’s economic model can be. If we want to eat well and be served by people paid a proper wage, we are going to have to accept that it will continue to cost more. That doesn’t mean all pricing is fine. Some restaurants do take liberties. Good value matters. But the cost of eating out is rising. Don’t bother being cross with me about that. It’s just a fact. And it will still be the case in 2022. See you next year.

12/26/2021,"“As ever for me, the best ideas are the intuitive ones:” Giorgio Armani is musing on his era-defining casting of Posh and Becks in his advertising campaign for Emporio Armani underwear back in 2008. “In those years, David and Victoria were at the center of attention,” he recalls. “In the mirroring of their respective personalities, they embodied the moment: the metrosexual man, and the seductive woman with a fierce entrepreneurial outlook on things. And they both paid utmost attention to their physical appearance [so] having them in underwear looked like the right idea … and it took very little effort to persuade both.” Armani – or Mr Armani as the fashion industry unofficially-officially refers to him – is a man who is no stranger to having the right idea. Aside from his multi-billion-pound Giorgio Armani empire, his Emporio Armani brand for which he managed to get the world’s most-talked-about couple down to their pants for is case in point. Established back in 1981 as a more liberal multi-platform to complement his eponymous mainline after seeing “a gap in the market and hunger from younger people for something new and fresh”, he proudly marked its 40th anniversary this year with an exhibition in his native Milan chronicling its trajectory.  “I wanted to show how innovative the brand has been since its very beginning,” says 87-year-old Armani who famously, like many designers of his generation – most notably the late Karl Lagerfeld – is “fiercely anti-nostalgic”. Initially, he says he “resisted the idea” of the exhibition but ever young at heart he says he “changed my mind when we switched from the retrospective format to adopt the concept of the exhibition as an experience and a lively manifesto”. A visual blitz through the past, The Way We Are is very much Armani’s homage to living in the present, documenting key moments such as its first menswear and womenswear catwalk shows in 1985 and its iconic campaigns shot by the likes of Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott, Peter Lindbergh and Armani’s longtime collaborator Aldo Fallai. “Honestly, it feels like an achievement,” reveals Armani in a rare self-congratulatory moment. “The collection that stemmed from my desire to talk to the younger generations evolved into an essential part of the Armani lifestyle as a whole: one that speaks a metropolitan language that still retains my pared-down, essential idea of elegance.” The first years of the brand, he continues, “are the ones I am most fond of, quite simply because we kept experimenting in order to find the right communication language, the perfect tone of voice for a collection that was so new.” If that sounds like familiar rhetoric in the current age of brands rushing to “speak” to Gen Z, back in 1981 Armani’s methods were pioneering. One of the most mined assets belonging to Emporio Armani for the exhibition is the brand’s huge glossy bi-monthly magazine which was launched in 1988 and helped to lay the foundations for the fashion industry adopting the concept of combining content with commerce. “Today, it’s normal for fashion brands both large and small to produce content of all kinds, but in 1988, Emporio Armani Magazine was something new,” says Armani, crediting his sister, Rosanna in helping him “create a product that was much more than a catalogue: a real magazine, in which photographic reports on the collection … were accompanied by articles dedicated to the most diverse topics, written by prominent authors.” To mark the brand’s anniversary, Armani commissioned a special issue of the publication for which features current Italian icons, including the Ferrari F1 drivers – and Armani ambassadors – Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz in conversation; the actor Pierfrancesco Favino on what it means to be an actor; and GQ-famed editor Masafumi Suzuki on the power of the suit alongside shoots of current collections. “I think printed matter will never die, because in the age of transience, it stays,” he says. “That is the statement I wanted to send out with this special, one-off issue of the magazine. I wanted to offer a picture of this moment that in twenty or forty years’ time will still feel relevant and timely.” The anniversary couldn’t pass without an ode being made to Milan, the city to which Armani is considered royalty. The hangar in the city’s Linate airport which has greeted arrivals with Emporio Armani in shimmering sky-scraping signage since 1996 is celebrated in all its dominant glory (“[I] love people to feel welcomed in a city that has always expressed modernity, energy, an optimistic outlook towards the future; an international metropolis with an Italian soul, exactly like Emporio) and the famous “Broletto” billboard in central Milan that, as well as the Beckhams, saw Cristiano Ronaldo and Rafael Nadal supersized in their underwear (he has a soft spot for sport, he admits, by virtue of the “discipline, hard work and teamwork” he relates to) both take centre stage. “I am quite proud of the fact that the Broletto billboards have become part of the Milanese urban landscape and as such a landmark,” he says. “What started as a fresh idea – adopting the bold language of traditional advertising and bringing it into the fashion world – has turned into a series of endless surprises that engage and entertain whoever passes from that spot.” During the pandemic, Armani – who donated more than €2m to hospitals in Milan, Rome, Bergamo, Piacenza, and Versilia in the devastating first few months – eschewed advertising on the billboard to instead “send out messages of hope, support, and happiness. It is a blank canvas that allows me freedom to communicate in a very direct way, and I truly enjoy it.” It’s a sentiment that he applies to his vision for Emporio Armani in its 40th year and for the future. “It stands for a set of values that are not merely aesthetic even though they are based on my appreciation for simplicity and elegance,” he says. “The only way to push boundaries is to keep looking at the world, at the evolutions of society, and act inventively. Fashion, for me, is always a reflection, and at times also an anticipation, of the moment.” Emporio Armani – The Way We Are is on display at Armani/Silos in Milan until 6 February 2022",Lifestyle/Fashion,Forza fashion: The pioneering vision of Armani,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2021/dec/26/forza-fashion-the-pioneering-vision-of-armani

Following the duchess’s real-life divorce from the duke (an icky Paul Bettany who will make you wince), it cleverly unpicks the institutional misogyny of the time, which targeted Campbell for being a woman who enjoyed sex. In fact, it could be argued that Thorpe stealing and using his wife’s explicit, private photos against her in court was an early example of revenge porn.

12/26/2021,"There was a strip of cafes and bars that ran alongside Tompkins Square park in the Lower East Side in New York and none of them minded if all you bought was a single coffee and sat all night long. So I did just that. It was the late 90s, I was 19 years old and I had never lived in a city before. I sat night after night in these cafes, reading books, watching people, drinking too much coffee. I didn’t really have anything else to do, I didn’t know anyone, so I’d sit and watch the East Village whirl around me. I wasn’t the only lonely kid, though. After a while I noticed another sitting night after night in Café Pick Me Up, a studious young man feverishly filling up notebooks. Café Pick Me Up was a cosy little place with a low pressed-metal ceiling, crammed full of tiny tables, with French cafe chairs and mellow lighting. If you were to write a romcom featuring a meet cute, you’d set it there.  I can’t remember who sent the first note; I can only imagine it must have been him because I certainly wasn’t that bold back then. He wanted to know what I was reading that night. I read voraciously back then, a book a day, in part to fill the long hours of boredom. I think I might have been a bit standoffish in my reply, but it didn’t deter him. He sent more notes. Eventually I asked him what he was writing. Poetry – it was his true love. He was Danish. It was nice to talk to someone, even nicer that he was European. I’d only been in New York for a couple of months but I missed home. I didn’t quite get these loud, mouthy New Yorkers. This quiet, thoughtful Danish poet was just what I was longing for. He was there the next night, and so was I, and the night after that and the following one. We struck up an intense friendship and spent all our free hours together. We’d hop from Café Pick Me Up to Alt Cafe next door, or end up sitting late into the night eating steaming bowls of cabbage soup in Leshko’s. It was winter, the coffee shops’ windows steamed up, the Christmas lights went up outside, it was bitterly cold, and when we were finally high on caffeine we’d walk it off. We were both penniless, but we were young and happy to stroll for hours, exploring Manhattan. One weekend we got up at the crack of dawn and walked the length of the island; it took all day. Through all this I learned about his life in Denmark, the childhood sweetheart waiting for him back home, how he was reluctantly training to become a social worker, but mostly about his infectious love of poetry. That bit worked very well on me. I was falling. His training placement in Manhattan was coming to an end, though. By Christmas he’d be home again. We had just weeks, we’d met too late and, anyway, he had a girlfriend. It was all very chaste, until it wasn’t. He’d walk me back each night through Tompkins Square park, with its Christmas lights glowing. One night he kissed me on a park bench. I knew we shouldn’t but he would be gone so soon. The next night a homeless guy on a bench nearby hollered at us to get a room, but we couldn’t as we both had fierce landladies. His flight left on 20 December, and we spent every available hour till then together, sitting up all night kissing on park benches, despite the bitter cold. On the morning of the 20th I left him to go to work at New York Botanical Garden, where I was employed in the labelling department. It was my job to make those plastic display labels you see on all the plants. I sat in an attic with a loud engraving machine and stacks of blank labels, meticulously spelling out Latin names, locations of origin and accession numbers. It was a pretty boring job but it had got me the ticket to New York and I only had to do it over the winter. Come spring I’d be gardening outside again. As no one ever came to the attic to see what I was doing – as long as the machine was running – I could go to sleep without anyone noticing. And I did that a lot, making up for all those late nights talking. That morning, broken-hearted, I curled up to sleep the day away. But I didn’t get to: my boss, Margaret, came to tell me there was a telephone call for me. No one ever called me at work, not even my mother. She looked at me curiously. I had to take the call at her desk. It was him calling from the airport. The cheapest way to fly back to Europe back then was via Iceland. He’d decided to make a trip of it, taking a three-day layover to explore the island before returning to his life in Denmark. He wanted to know if I would come. He’d buy the ticket; he had a hotel room already paid for, and we could see the northern lights. We’d be alone with all that ice and snow for three whole days. Then we’d go our separate ways. All I had to do was tell my boss I was suddenly very unwell, get back to Manhattan, pick up my passport, and a ticket would be waiting for me for the evening flight; he’d meet me at the other side. With Margaret looking on, and noting this was probably the case, he said: “Think about it, make your excuses, call me back in 30 minutes and I’ll book the flight.” I put the phone down. I cannot now remember much about this man – not what he looked like, nor his name, nor where in Denmark he came from – but I can remember exactly how my heart felt in my chest, the way the office span around as I ached with sadness and lack of sleep. I never called him back. I waited for the half-hour to pass and then I went back to making labels. I sobbed so loudly in my attic space, I don’t think the machine drowned it out. But if I had gone it would no longer have been so innocent. He had a girlfriend and a life to return to, whereas my time in New York was just beginning. Still, I spent the next three days inconsolable. New York was twinkling with Christmas cheer and I was heartbroken and alone again.

12/26/2021,"The question I am due to be the bridesmaid at my friend’s wedding. She’s been engaged for five years. The whole thing has had to be rearranged twice due to the pandemic and now it’s on for 2022. When she became engaged, I was one of her only mates. We had been teenage friends and used to go out drinking and partying. She started working and became sensible and ambitious, met her fiancé and settled down. I went to college, met a bunch of people I bonded with and we started to drift apart. She asked me to be her bridesmaid more than four years ago and I think it was because at that time there were not many other people she could ask.  Since then, our friendship has continued to diminish. She refuses ever to meet on week nights because of work and doesn’t like to go out on the weekend any more. I go to her house for a cuppa about twice a year. She talks wedding plans, we do a rudimentary catching up, and then I leave. We don’t speak for months at a time. We don’t share any interests, we don’t have any other friends in common. I haven’t even met her fiancé because she has told me that we won’t get on. Neither of us has really put any time or effort into our friendship. Unfortunately, she cares strongly about the perfect wedding, another thing which we don’t agree on. My dilemma is this: I am working a low-pay job and cannot afford a four-day hen do abroad. I want to get out of this responsibility. I do not want to go to the hen do, be a bridesmaid, or even go to the wedding. My friends tell me to grin and bear it, that it’s only a few days, but I have never wanted to escape a situation more. Philippa’s answer You are reminding me of that Reba McEntire track, I’d Rather Ride Around With You, about a bridesmaid who jumps into a sports car with her boyfriend when she should have been at church holding the bouquet for her cousin, the bride. It’s a great story-song, have a listen. You are expected to make good your promise. She wants the perfect wedding and you fit the perfect bridesmaid role. The bride even has a cup of tea with you twice a year (to be fair we have had lockdown) to keep you primed for this role. It will be horrible to be the “bad person” in this and the extraction process will be unpleasant, but the relief of not having to go through this charade will make up for that. What your friends haven’t realised is that it’s not just a few days of the hen do and the wedding that you lose if you go through with this, but all the days leading up to it as well. Your life at the moment seems to be tarnished with background dread. If you get yourself out of this situation, you will get back more than saved money and a few days, you’ll also free yourself from months of this trepidation. How about sending her a letter: “Dear X, I am really sorry, I know I promised all those years ago to be your bridesmaid and a good person would keep good her promise. But as your wedding approaches I find myself not wanting to be a bridesmaid, not wanting to join the hen do and not even really wanting to go to the wedding. I realise by extracting myself I’m not being a great friend to you and I’m sorry. It’s not just that I can’t afford it and I can’t, it’s that I don’t want to be there. I can’t put on an act and I don’t want to spoil your day by not being enthusiastic. I hope you have a wonderful day and I’m sorry. Love from… PS Sometimes being authentic means I’m not as kind as I would wish to be, sorry.” If you need permission to break your promise, I am giving it to you. And if you need an excuse to justify your actions to yourself, it seems she has only wanted to spend time with you lately on her terms and you have to come to her. But the thing that sticks in my throat more, is her not introducing you to her fiancé and saying you won’t get on. She obviously loves him because she’s chosen to spend her life with him, but what does it say about her regard for you, if she doesn’t want the two of you to meet? But you don’t need excuses, your dread is reason enough to go back on this promise. Free yourself from dread. Release her from having a hostage at her wedding. There is a strong possibility she’ll not see it like that and be very hurt. But one of you will suffer – either you with the dread, or her with the hurt. Now I’m playing Please Release Me, Let Me Go, by Engelbert Humperdinck, and one of the lines in that song is “to live a lie would be a sin”.

12/26/2021,"The Christmas lights are on along the nation’s busiest high street, but beneath their festive glow about a quarter of the outlets are either empty, or housing temporary shops. Alongside the shuttered stores and building sites on London’s Oxford Street are now at least a dozen shops selling confectionery, cheap souvenirs or perfume, giving it the air of a rundown seaside resort rather than a global retail destination.  Big names including Topshop, Debenhams, Gap, French Connection and Carphone Warehouse have disappeared, while others, such as Next and Monsoon have reduced their space. And little wonder: in the second year of the pandemic, sales in the Oxford Street area, including Regent Street and Bond Street, dropped by £8bn to £2bn last year and are expected to reach just £5bn this year, according to trade body the New West End Company (NWEC). The vast former House of Fraser department store will close next month before it is redeveloped into offices and a rooftop restaurant above a smaller shop and a basement gym with a pool. Both Marks & Spencer and John Lewis are considering converting some of their retail space into offices and leisure facilities. Drapers, bonnet makers and saddlers began to take over from pubs and theatres on Oxford Street at the end of the 18th century, and these changes mark a historic retreat from retail’s national stronghold. “I do think we have hit the bottom,” says Jace Tyrrell, the chief executive of NWEC. The 1.2-mile long shopping street is in the throes of major change, with Covid accelerating the switch to buying online and in more local shops. This has driven away commuters, day trippers and international tourists. But Oxford Street is still devoted almost exclusively to retail. It has just one pub, and very few dining outlets facing the thoroughfare. (There are, however, restaurants and cafes in department stores such as Selfridges and John Lewis.) Redevelopments promise more entertainment and dining alongside office space and leisure facilities such as gyms and crazy golf. There may also be more flats, which is not new: in Victorian times it was common for shop staff to be housed above the store. Mark Robinson, chair of the government’s High Streets Task Force, says Oxford Street’s future must be about reacting to consumer and stakeholder demands: “Its location and heritage give it an enormous start.” The street has reinvented itself before: in the early 18th century the Roman road out of London had become a muddy track by the time it reached the gallows at Tyburn, now known as Marble Arch. A building boom in the 1700s saw terraced houses replace the street’s animal pounds and seedy pubs. The houses were soon converted into retail spaces, with workrooms above, for drapers, bootmakers and milliners. In the early 1800s there was a trend for “bazaars” – indoor markets that often included entertainment as well as stalls. In the 1870s, as outlined in Andrew Saint’s Survey of London, department stores emerged. Marshall & Snelgrove, on the site of the now-empty Debenhams, was among the first, but of the Victorian retail giants only John Lewis remains. Well-known names including Peter Robinson, Bourne & Hollingsworth and furniture maker Waring & Gillow are long gone. Before retail took over, Oxford Street was an entertainment hotspot, home to several theatres, starting with the Pantheon in 1772. That gave its name and site to the Marks & Spencer store east of Oxford Circus. There have been churches on the street, as well as hospitals and several pubs – only one of which, the Flying Horse near Tottenham Court Road, survives. Lyons, the tearooms operator, once had three “corner houses” on Oxford Street, and training rooms in the building that is now Marks & Spencer Marble Arch. Tyrrell says Oxford Street must look to its history to build a more “European approach”, with food and drink services, entertainment, seating and greenery serving offices above. “We still think that by 2024 we will be back to £10bn of sales – even given what has happened in the world – but this will be from a very different mix and different customer. There will be more people working, a longer dwell time and more domestic shoppers coming to London.” Rents in the street have fallen by up to 50%, according to Tyrrell, and that could foster new ideas. Paul Swinney at the Centre for Cities thinktank agrees: “In the past the risk of trading [for a new business] in the centre of London was too expensive. If that comes down, it opens a new business opportunity for experiment and innovation.” For that to succeed, though, work must be done on making Oxford Street a more attractive place to dally. Westminster council has pledged to £150m of public realm improvements, including more greenery and seating, but it ditched plans for temporary piazzas on either side of Oxford Circus this year after an early attempt to lure back the crowds backfired. The widely mocked £6m Marble Arch Mound, an artificial hill intended as an attraction linking Oxford Street to Hyde Park, had to switch to free entry after only two days, and is set to close next month. Westminster council now plans wide consultation before confirming its plans to improve the look and feel of the street. But finding a happy solution could be tough. Traffic has been reduced and the pavements widened in recent years, but it’s hard to engender a leisured atmosphere amid a constant stream of buses and taxis, with no space for slower transport such as bicycles. The traffic problems seem endemic: witnesses to a royal commission more than a century ago, in 1903, complained that there were too many buses on Oxford Street. Proposals for improvement have varied from a 1960s plan for a deck above the street to carry shoppers via a travelator and a 1970s scheme for a track carrying cars on air cushions, to numerous calls for full pedestrianisation. Today the street is banking on Crossrail, or the Elizabeth Line, which will ferry in shoppers from further afield if it opens this spring, at least four years later than once hoped. Plans for improvement have “got to get moving fast”, according to Tyrrell. “The next couple of years we have got a window,” he says. “Not just retail but all brands will be looking at the street. When we get into the spring and summer, and customers and office workers are back, that’s when trends and perceptions are going to be set. We have to make sure we are ready to take that opportunity.” Andrew Saint’s The Survey of London, Vol 53: Oxford Street, is published by Yale University Press",News/Business,Oxford Street: why London’s shopping mecca can’t trade on past glories,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/26/oxford-street-why-londons-shopping-mecca-cant-trade-on-past-glories
12/26/2021,"This year the public saw an alarming side of Facebook, after a huge leak of internal documents revealed the extent of vaccine misinformation and extremism on the platform, a two-tier system of who gets to break the rules, and the toxic effects of Instagram for teens. Digital rights activists around the world have warned about these issues for years, but with the company facing mounting pressure, next year could provide an unprecedented opportunity for action.  We spoke to researchers, activists, and tech experts about how Facebook can be reined in 2022 and beyond, and the innovative solutions that could bring about change. In the US, the path towards regulation is likely to be a long one. But this year has seen rare bipartisan calls to tighten the rules on big tech. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects Facebook from lawsuits if users post anything illegal, has once again come under scrutiny. Rashad Robinson, president of the civil rights group Color of Change, who led a corporate boycott of Facebook in July 2020, says amending it is a critical first step. “I believe that there needs to be a removal of the Section 230 immunity when it comes to paid advertising and when it comes to things that are connected to product design,” Robinson said. Meanwhile, lawmakers have introduced bills – including the Children and Media Research Advancement Act and the Algorithmic Justice and Online Platform Transparency Act of 2021 – that would, respectively, fund research into the platform’s effects on young people and tackle Facebook’s often inscrutable algorithms. Robinson says such laws would address “the ways in which Facebook makes money and refuses to be held accountable”. In Europe, 2022 will see a final decision by the European court of justice (ECJ) in a German online gaming case that could pave the way for Facebook to face legal ramifications for privacy violations. Javier Pallero, the policy director at the digital civil rights organisation Access Now, says any regulation must consider human rights, particularly when it comes to content moderation in the global south. Facebook’s current moderation model is flawed, he says. “They either allow too much or they take down too much and they end up basically censoring entities, activists, and so on around the world. So you need human moderators, ergo, you need more investment, you need more people.” Facebook’s sheer size and market dominance remain a major barrier to change, and a growing chorus of lawmakers and others are calling for a simple solution – break it up. Matt Stoller, research director at the American Economic Liberties Project, Facebook’s vast power is the greatest threat to democracy. “He’s operating like a sovereign,” Stoller says of Zuckerberg. “And that’s what a monopolist is. Somebody who has control, governing power over a market.” First, Stoller urges breaking up Facebook’s grip on the social media market. Once Facebook took over all its competitors, he says, “they just started surveilling and doing anything that they wanted, and there was really no way around it”. Second, Stoller proposes bringing criminal charges against Zuckerberg and his leadership team over allegations of fraud and insider trading. (Facebook has rejected those claims.) Third, Stoller recommends imposing rules on the social media marketplace so companies such as Facebook can’t be financed by or engage in advertising that is driven by hyper-personalized surveillance. Some of the strongest pushes for change are coming from Facebook’s own workforce or former workers, including Frances Haugen, the former product manager at Facebook’s civic integrity department who disclosed tens of thousands of the company’s internal documents to the Wall Street Journal and the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Jeff Allen and Sahar Massachi are a former data scientist and data engineer at Facebook who helped build the company’s election and civic integrity team and now run a non-profit organization called the Integrity Institute. They believe the solution is empowering integrity professionals who deal with issues such as trust, security and detecting fake activity. Massachi says Facebook’s culture currently incentivises the opposite: one team will flag harmful content and recommend driving down engagement, while another team will find a trick to increase engagement with the harmful content. To fix this, he proposes introducing a monthly metric that ranks companies based on integrity. Regulators could monitor companies based on this metric. He envisions regulators being able to take concrete action if companies don’t keep up their score. Katie Harbath, founder and CEO of the tech policy consultancy Anchor Change, said the lack of empowerment for integrity teams was a structural problem at Facebook. “The fact that the integrity team reports into the growth team is problematic,” she said, leading to prioritising growth. “One way to think about this would be to actually put integrity and growth on the same level within the company.” When Facebook promised to collaborate on a research initiative with academics after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, there were hopes it would shed light on how Facebook affects society. Instead, researchers were met with flawed and incomplete data, with only a handful of scholars granted access. Nate Persily, professor at Stanford Law School and the director of the Stanford Cyber Policy Center, has worked with Facebook in an academic capacity but became increasingly frustrated with the amount of data the company shared with researchers. Since then he has drafted text for a law – the Platform Transparency and Accountability Act – which would grant scholars access to information the social media company holds, while protecting user privacy. “These companies have thrived in secrecy and we are now seeing that from the Frances Haugen revelations,” Persily said. The impact of opening the data up would be twofold: first, it would educate academics and the public about what’s happening on the platform, including the role of algorithms, apps targeting kids, and rates of disinformation, Persily said. Second, Facebook would behave differently if it knew it was being watched.",News/Technology,"Regulate, break up, open up: how to fix Facebook in 2022",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/25/facebook-how-to-fix-break-up-regulation
12/26/2021,"I read with interest “Host of golden daffodils will rot in the fields for want of foreign pickers” (News). While farmers are struggling to recruit UK workers, the National Farmers’ Union lists the UK’s new points-based immigration system, which coincides with the free movement of EU citizens ending because of Brexit, as one of the reasons for this problem. Giving asylum seekers the right to work would allow them to use their skills and live in dignity. How can the government justify to farmers who need labour the policy of not allowing people who are already in the UK the right to fill these vacancies? How can you explain to a farmer who has no labour to harvest his fruit, vegetables or flowers that, yes, we have people who are eager to work but we will not allow it and if you employ them you will be breaking the law? Refugee Action has been running a campaign to “lift the ban”. The Lift the Ban coalition report shows that a change in policy would result in an economic gain of £97.8m a year for the government as a result of additional tax revenues and savings. This is based on the amount that would be saved by not having to provide cash support plus the extra money received by the exchequer through payroll contributions from income tax and national insurance. Other sectors would also benefit from a change in this Kafkaesque scenario.Virginia BrownTalgarth, Powys  Who would argue with Catherine Bennett about the need for tougher penalties for dangerous, careless, uninsured, irresponsible or even intoxicated drivers (“Pity the poor, oppressed driver forced to share their roads with the rest of us”, Comment)? But what she misses is the impact on the victims. Society pays little attention to those seriously but not fatally injured, whose livelihoods are lost as a result of someone else’s wrong decisions. They are left to the machinations of insurance companies whose motivation seems to be minimising and delaying compensation pay-outs. The companies’ prolonged negotiations leave victims with no financial cover when they need it most and mental and physical suffering. By all means pile up the righteous indignation if it will prevent future carnage but spare a few thoughts for the many permanently injured people whose lives are never the same after a chance encounter on the road.Yvonne WilliamsRyde, Isle of Wight I, too, am very worried about the future of the NHS (“A dangerous lie is stalking the NHS: that it is no longer fit for purpose”, Comment). Since 1948, many on the right have been keen to kill it off. However, until recently, the popularity of the NHS has prevented this. The way the Tories traditionally move a public service into the private sector is to underfund it to the point that the public will agree to any change in the hope of seeing it improve. This was classically demonstrated by the way the railways were run down in the 1980s in order to privatise them in the 1990s. NHS funding stagnated between 2010 and 2016, with the corresponding rise in waiting lists to 4.5 million pre pandemic. The political strategy could not be any more transparent.John KinderRomsey, Hampshire Re “Strange beasts, these ‘libertarians’ who love to curb the freedom of others” (Comment): for another example of libertarian inconsistency, Kenan Malik needed to look no further than Nick Cohen’s description of the damagingly partisan elections bill (“The Tories call it electoral reform. Looks more like a bid to rig the system”, Comment). Last week, Unlock Democracy, Open Britain and Fair Vote UK wrote to all the Conservative Covid rebels about the elections bill. We pointed out that, if it is passed, to be allowed to vote people will need to present photographic identity documents. This unnecessary requirement will cost up to £180m over 10 years and actively discriminates against young, older and disabled voters. For Conservative rebels committed to fighting a “papers, please” society, there will be a chance at the report stage of this bill to stand up and be counted and defeat photo voter ID. I fear many will be missing in action.Tom Brake, director, Unlock DemocracyLondon N1 Your rugby union correspondent, Michael Aylwin, writes that primary-school teacher is a euphemism for “part-timer” in his report on Cardiff’s heroic performance against Harlequins in the Champions Cup (“Dombrandt’s double helps break resistance of Cardiff’s kids”, Sport). Is he up for changing jobs in January with Cardiff’s stand-in hooker, Evan Yardley?Rob WalkerLinthwaite, Huddersfield One factor Simon Tisdall might have mentioned in his thoughtful article (“The world is ablaze. Xi, Putin and Biden must join the firefighters”, Foreign affairs commentary): while each world leader’s interest is in protecting his/her back, the one voice that reaches every corner of the world and consistently advocates the common good is Pope Francis. He urges world leaders not simply to look after their own interests but to work together to abolish nuclear weapons and capital punishment, to oppose interests that selfishly squander natural resources and damage the world’s ecosystems, to make refugees welcome in more prosperous countries, to put an end to the enslavement and trafficking of vulnerable women and to make the sharing of technology to defeat Covid a priority.Guido WaldmanLondon N1 Angela Neustatter’s article was a beautiful account of her grandmother’s role as AS Neill’s partner in founding the extraordinary Summerhill school as it celebrates a century of existence against all the odds (“My grandmother’s forgotten role in the school with no rules”, Focus). She rightly also referred to the debt the school owes to the “charismatic” Zoe Redhead, Neill’s daughter and successor. At a time when the pressures on childhood and adolescence have made being a “good enough parent” so much more difficult, Redhead has just written Barefoot in November: Parenting the Summerhill Way. It is published by the Summerhill Trust and is, a guide to hard-pressed parents – and grandparents and other guardians, for that matter – on how to cope with the everyday, and increasingly vexed, issues of family life. Summerhill is not, as your headline suggests, “the school with no rules”; it has plenty, but the children are involved in agreeing and enforcing them. A failure to involve pupils in the running of our schools has been a drag on school improvement, especially in England, and has led to a decade-long fad for “zero tolerance” and “assertive discipline”, which has resulted in 1,500 pupils being permanently excluded from English schools for every one excluded in Scotland.

12/26/2021,"London’s Oxford Street is undergoing a painful reinvention as some of its biggest names close their doors. House of Fraser is expected to leave in January, while Debenhams, Topshop, French Connection and Gap are already shuttered. While there are no guarantees for the future, there is hope in the fact that the nation’s retail mecca has undergone multiple reinventions. Here, we take a walk through 300 years of Oxford Street history, through the evolution of five key buildings.  Woolworths, July 1957. Left: Royal Bazaar, coloured lithograph, circa 1829. Right: Sports Direct in 2021. Billionaire Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct has just lavished £10m creating a London emporium designed to throw off its bargain tracksuit image and dazzle the crowds when it opened this summer. His chosen site has been involved in drama from the start. When the Royal Bazaar opened its doors in 1827, it offered a mix of entertainment and retail with artworks and other goods on sale alongside a diorama, where audiences stood on a rotating platform to view semi-transparent paintings lit to give the impression of changing seasons or shifts from day to night. The diorama caught fire, and by 1840 the Princess Theatre had opened in its place, hosting high class Shakespeare plays and popular melodramas, according to Andrew Saint’s Survey of London published for the Bartlett School of Architecture at University College London, and informs our history of the street. It was not until 1931 that new owners created Princess House, a modern building housing offices and workrooms and an outlet for relatively new arrival, Woolworths, which occupied the basement and ground floors complete with a cafeteria and lunch bar for 500 people. Woolworths departed in 1977, 32 years before the UK business went bust and disappeared from Britain’s high streets, and the site became a shopping mall called Oxford Walk. Then in 1986 HMV moved in, claiming the three-floor 600,000 sq ft (55,740 sq metres) store was “the biggest music shop in the world”. Such space became increasingly redundant as new technology diminished demand for vinyl records then CDs and DVDs and HMV went into administration in late 2013, making way for cut price fashion chain Sports Direct to move in. Ikea will be taking over the building previously occupied by Topshop at 214 Oxford Street. Left: Crystal Palace Bazaar, circa 1858. Right: Peter Robinson department store, on the corner of Oxford Street and Great Portland Street, circa 1905. Once the sparkling gem of British high street fashion, Topshop’s former flagship on Oxford Street lies empty. Now being refitted to lead furniture chain Ikea’s march on to high street, this north-east corner of Oxford Circus encapsulates the history and the future of British shopping in one site. In 1858 the spot debuted as the Crystal Palace Bazaar, an iron and glass-roofed shopping arcade selling toys, jewellery and other goods, in a building designed by the architect Owen Jones who had been involved with the Crystal Palace. The glittering emporium only had a small entrance on Oxford Street which, at that time, was not a major shopping destination. As trading dwindled, the building was bought by Yorkshire draper Peter Robinson in 1876 as part of the expansion of his clothing business. In 1912, a building covering the entire block was erected with Peter Robinson occupying the lower floors and an upper floor restaurant crowned by domed ceilings decorated with murals, which are still there today. In 1965, the department store’s basement became home to Topshop which in 1994 took over the building, hosting a hairdressers and a nail bar alongside its giant changing rooms. Sports brand Nike took over the prime corner plot in 1999. Topshop finally exited the high street last year after it fell into administration and was bought by online specialist Asos. The building that was BHS. John Lewis East House, decorated in 1953 for the coronation the Queen. The 2016 closure of Oxford Street’s BHS, and its dozens of other outlets around the country, was at the heart of a retail scandal. The collapse of the ailing department store, just a year after it was sold for £1 to a serial bankrupt by the retail tycoon Sir Philip Green, led to thousands of redundancies and a hefty pension deficit only covered by Green’s family after public outcry. The department store’s grubby end came after even grubbier beginnings, with part of site on the Cavendish-Harley estate once home to Nibbs’s Pound for lost pigs, according to Saint. There was also a stable yard nearby, alongside the Phoenix pub. Redevelopment began in the reign of George I and by the 1780s there were a range of shops including a saddler and a print seller. The occupants were eventually bought out by Spedan Lewis, the head of John Lewis, in 1928. After John Lewis came the fast expanding BHS, which opened its flagship there in 1961. The site has now been divided into a pick and mix array of uses including Polish fashion chain Reserved!, Swingers crazy golf and a tourist souvenir and sweet shop. One name has remained a constant for the last 300 years, however: the block still houses a pub called the Phoenix. Marks & Spencer, December 1964. Artist’s impression of the new Marks & Spencer store at Marble Arch. Marks & Spencer’s Marble Arch flagship store is right at the sharp end of the reinvention of the Oxford Street. The retailer wants to raze its current plot, which includes Orchard House, completed in 1930, to make way for a building that will halve its selling space, from five floors to just two-and-a-half, topped by several floors of offices. The development will include a shopping arcade, a small park and potentially leisure facilities, such as a gym. While Westminster council has given approval for the plan, pending the go-ahead from the mayor of London, campaigners have urged a rethink, criticising the scheme over its potential carbon footprint and destruction of a historic building. The loss of retail space, however, is very much back to the 19th century for Oxford Street. Like most of the street this stretch began as terraced houses. By the 1830s all had shops on the ground floor, with homes or small workrooms for businesses, such as milliners or dressmakers, above. Orchard House was commissioned by tearoom operator Lyons & Co which used the upper floors as training rooms until the late 1960s. M&S, which opened its first London store in 1899 having grown from a penny bazaar in Leeds, initially took the ground floor and basement of the new building. Marks & Spencer gradually expanded to take more of the building, before the rise of online shopping made such acreage redundant.

Shoppers swarm through the entrance to the C&A clothing store at Marble Arch, for the start of the January sale 1956. Left: Primark, near Marble Arch. Right: Allders department store. Primark’s 100,000 sq ft store near Marble Arch caused mayhem when it opened its doors in 2007, with shoppers queuing down the street for two hours and battling to snap up cut price fashion at the chain’s first central London outlet. Primark has endured a difficult few years during the pandemic when it has been forced to close its doors for months on end, with no online sales to fall back on. But that is nothing compared with the grim fortunes of previous retailers in this spot. Once the site of several grand houses on the Grosvenor Estate’s Hereford Gardens, it was taken on by the Gamages department store group in 1928 which wanted to expand from its Holborn base to a new store with flats above. The building cost more than £1m, with construction overseen by the arts and crafts era star architect, Sir Edward Lutyens. While the luxury flats were a success, the store, which opened in 1930 at the height of the Great Depression, closed after only eight months. In 1938 it was bought out, becoming the UK headquarters of C&A, which used the upper floors as its offices. The Dutch fashion chain had opened its first UK outlet just eight years earlier, further along Oxford Street, and continued to trade until 2001 when its rainbow logo and cheap fashions had fallen out of favour. The site was next taken on by Allders department store, but by 2005 that group collapsed into administration with hefty debts, paving the way for Primark’s grand entrance.",News/Business,Oxford Street buildings through time – photo essay ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/26/oxford-street-buildings-through-time-photo-essay
