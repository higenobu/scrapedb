3/1/2022,"Let’s be generous to Priti Patel. She’s by far the dimmest member of the cabinet – a low water mark in a confederacy of dunces – so it’s possible no one has told her that Boris Johnson has changed his mind on Ukraine from his 2016 assessment of Russia’s invasion of Crimea, which he blamed on the EU. So she may think she is doing the government a favour in blocking the flow of Ukrainian refugees to the UK. There again, the home secretary is also vicious, so she may just enjoy the sight of hundreds of thousands of women and children seeking sanctuary. Either way, Priti Vacant isn’t having a good war. While the rest of the country sees a homeless population trying to avoid a war zone, she just sees people who are somehow looking to take advantage of the UK. The home secretary has never seen a refugee she really trusted to go back home when it was safe. At least, that’s the appearance she gave in the Commons on Monday afternoon. By any normal standards, Patel ought to have been giving a ministerial statement on the government’s handling of the refugee crisis; but instead she merely gave the Commons a quick heads up during Home Office departmental questions. Mainly, presumably, because she didn’t feel she had a lot to say. The EU might have decided to temporarily waive visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees, but the UK most definitely would not be following suit. There was far too much chance of us taking the wrong kind of refugee. People who could have been better accommodated by other European countries. Criminals with fixed penalty notices for breaking lockdown rules. Russians masquerading as Ukrainians. Or “the” Ukrainians. Patel insisted on calling Ukraine “the Ukraine”. It was all very confusing. Patel was adamant that the visa requirements were being made more generous, only for her to contradict herself by saying that the new rules would only let in people with immediate family in the UK. She didn’t sound at all pleased to be allowing up to 100,000 of the Ukrainians into the country. Not even the thought that other European countries were taking in significantly more people could cheer her up. The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, tried to make sense of the muddle. So were we making it easier for refugees to get into the UK or not, she asked. Because it wasn’t at all clear from what Patel had said so far. Vacant looked vacant and did what she always does when she’s on the back foot. She snapped and got angry. She had said all that needed to be said, and if no one had quite understood everything then it was their fault. She couldn’t be blamed if no one could quite keep up with her. Had it been a ministerial statement, there’s a fair chance that Patel would have come under pressure from many MPs on her own side who are upset by the UK’s lack of generosity to refugees. They want their government to walk the walk as well as talk the talk. But given that it was just departmental questions, there was no time for anyone to interrogate the home secretary’s thinking. Though they may get a chance on Tuesday as the Speaker made it plain he was dissatisfied at Patel trying to stifle debate and would be happy to grant an urgent question the following day. Still, Patel wasn’t the only one getting it in the neck. Earlier in the session, the shadow junior Home Office minister Stephen Kinnock had asked Kevin Foster, his opposite number, to unreservedly apologise for his tweet suggesting that Ukrainians could come to this country via the seasonal workers visa. If Foster had had a shred of dignity he could have just said he had been off his head when he had tweeted on Sunday. Instead he doubled down. He wasn’t going to apologise – though curiously he had deleted the tweet – and many Ukrainians had been in touch with him to say how grateful they were to be offered the opportunity to pick fruit at some point in the future. So Labour should just learn to get with the programme. Foster is nothing if not loyal to his boss. Though he may just be as half-witted. For a lesson in taking the Commons with you, Patel could have learned a lot from Liz Truss, the warrior queen who won’t rest till every UK citizen is fighting in Ukraine, who gave an update on sanctions immediately afterwards. The foreign secretary may be hopelessly vain and see almost everything as an Instagram opportunity, but she is at least aware of her limitations. Or maybe she’s just very good at blocking out her mistakes. But in her favour, Truss can do some of the basic niceties. So by striking a collaborative tone and thanking MPs for their support, she effortlessly carried the opposition with her. Apart from the patronising Barry Sheerman, who said he was much more experienced than her and she ought to take his advice on asking the oligarchs for help. Truss even managed to ignore him without causing offence. Best of all, though, was Matt Hancock who really didn’t have anything to say but felt the need to say something anyway. So he burbled on about there being no need for her to blame herself for Putin having gone nuclear. Which she hadn’t been doing in any case. In fact she was thrilled to have been considered so influential. After all, it doesn’t happen that often. But what Matt really wanted to talk about was how much in love he was. There had never been a love story quite like his and Gina’s. The star crossed lovers who had managed to conquer all. He wanted to shout his love from the rooftops. And not just from some embarrassing podcast. He had so much love to give, he had all his life to live. Whoops … that was the Suspect’s song. Gissa job. Need and teenage hormones dripped from every pore. No one quite knew where to look.

3/1/2022,"Natalia Balasynovych, the mayor of Vasylkiv, woke up at 5.13am last Thursday and thought there was a fireworks display outside. She quickly realised that, in fact, Vladimir Putin had launched an assault on Ukraine. Missiles were raining down on her town. Vasylkiv is a pleasant, quiet town of 36,000 people about 20 miles outside Kyiv. But it contains a military airfield, and is home to one of Ukraine’s four air defence control centres. This meant it was an early target for the Russians, who want control of the airfield to land troops and launch an advance on Kyiv from the south. Balasynovych had read all the speculation about a possible Russian invasion, and as mayor had gone over drills of what to do if it really happened. But “in her soul”, she said, she never believed it was possible. As she jumped out of bed on Thursday, it was soon clear she had been wrong. “I had 10 minutes of panic when I was running around the house and I had no idea what to do. Then I pulled myself together and went to work,” she said, speaking at an interview in a fortified building in the town, guarded by armed volunteers, where the local administration is working to keep the town running. Balasynovych, 37, has been in local politics since her twenties and is known as a campaigner for women’s rights and the victims of domestic abuse. Now she finds herself coordinating her city’s response to a Russian assault. There have been surprises about who turned out to be the most resilient among her team of local administrators, now cast in the role of military organisers and local defenders. “My secretary is 19 years old and she is here almost 24 hours a day. She isn’t scared of bombs and she’s completely fearless; I wouldn’t have guessed it,” Balasynovych said. Her economic adviser, Andriy Melnyk, has become the commander of the city’s “territorial defence forces”. Weapons have been handed out to all who want them, something she concedes will probably fuel a domestic violence catastrophe in future. “But for now, victory is more important,” she said. On the third night of the Russian assault, Vasylkiv was again hit with missiles. The target this time was a fuel storage facility which exploded, causing a huge boom to rumble through the town. Smoke was still rising from the location on Monday afternoon. Also hit was a technical college on the main street, blowing a huge crater in the centre of the building, and tossing pipes and debris over a wide area. Balasynovych at the time was in a cellar with 70 other people. The walls began shaking and everyone inside was terrified.“I called the priest from the local monastery and put him on video call and we all prayed together. I thought it was the last moment of my life,” she recalled. Amid the attacks, work has begun in earnest to keep the town fed, as food and fuel shortages threaten to make life even harder for the millions of Ukrainians sheltering from Putin’s aggression. On Monday, after a 39-hour weekend curfew, residents emerged to stock up on supplies, and there were long queues at pharmacies and supermarkets. Other shops remain closed. Amid widespread confusion and deliberate disinformation strategies, it has been hard to pin down details of exactly what has happened in many places across Ukraine in the past few days, and Vasylkiv is no exception. Ukrainian authorities have claimed that two Ilyushin transport planes, from which the Russians were trying to land troops and hardware at Vasylkiv, were shot out of the sky over the weekend, and that Russian troops dropped into the city launched an assault on the airbase and were repelled. Balasynovych confirmed this account, and Melnyk said he had been involved in shooting battles with Russian soldiers who had dropped in. Balasynovych said there were “about 10” casualties on the Ukrainian side and 28 people still in hospital. But no convincing public evidence has surfaced about the two downed planes, or about a drop of paratroopers in Vasylkiv. “So far, there has not been evidence of a Russian airborne assault on Vasylkiv, though Russian forces may have sent a ground force detachment there early on from the north,” said Michael Kofman, a military analyst who has been closely tracking the Russian assault. Also difficult to verify were Balasynovych’s claims about a large network of Russian agents, living in local towns and villages, many of whom had spent months blending into local communities, won over people’s trust and had been carefully identifying targets and making measurements to pass back to their bosses in Moscow. When asked for evidence or further information about their arrests, she cited military secrecy. There is certainly no doubt about the missile attacks on Vasylkiv – on Monday afternoon shocked students walked through the destroyed remains of their former technical college, presumably hit by a missile aimed at the military college across the street. Sights like these have helped to consolidate the mood that has been gradually maturing over the last eight years in towns like Vasylkiv, which were never previously known as hotbeds of Ukrainian nationalism. “Every second person here has family links to Russia,” said Balasynovych. Men came from all over the Soviet Union to study at Vasylkiv’s aviation academy, including Balasynovych’s grandfather, who grew up in Russia, met a local woman at a military ball and settled in Vasylkiv. Even now, part of her family lives in Belarus, and her cousin is a paratrooper in the Belarusian army. With Belarus edging closer to full participation in Putin’s war, she now faces the prospect that her own cousin could be fighting to take over her town. As she spoke of these painful splits, a call came in: a Russian sabotage group had been apprehended at a checkpoint just outside the town. Some had been shot dead, but one was alive and still talking. “I want to look him in the eye, and talk to him,” she said. She pulled on a flak jacket – the first time she had ever worn one, she said – and summoned a large van with blacked-out windows. The van was bought with an international grant and in normal times was used to transport victims of domestic violence from locations across Ukraine to a shelter. Now she uses it to traverse the town, usually accompanied by armed men. On the way to meet the captured Russian, she drove past a checkpoint where a man was giving lessons in how to make molotov cocktails, the symbol of this new Ukrainian resistance. Volodymyr Kravets, an 83-year-old veteran of the Soviet missile forces, was at the checkpoint to request a few molotov cocktails to throw from his house, just down the road from the checkpoint. Kravets did his military service in the Russian far north in 1959, and used to have warm feelings for the country, but said he was now disgusted with Putin’s Russia and wanted to fight his invading army. “I tried to buy a gun but they told me I was too old. I at least want one of these to throw at the fuckers,” he said with a cackle symbolic of just how much Putin’s actions have damaged affection for Russia even in the older generation. In the end, the van was turned back before the scene of the shootout. At the last minute, the national guard sealed off the checkpoint. The story of the Russian sabotage group was another claim that could not be verified. Balasynovych said that while it was important Ukraine did not capitulate, she hoped negotiations with Russia might bring some kind of compromise to avoid the trauma that would come from an extended war. “People used to think about new car or iPhone, but nobody was thinking about peace. Now, we are dreaming of it. When old people used to wish each other peace, we didn’t understand what they meant. Now we do.”",News/World news,Vasylkiv: why this small Ukrainian town is now a big Russian target,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/vasylkiv-why-this-small-ukrainian-town-is-now-a-big-russian-target
3/1/2022,"Good morning. Today marks the fifth day of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as countries and companies around the world boycott Russia. In Australia, more rain is set to prolong devastating floods in south-east Queensland, and the UN releases its latest and “bleakest warning yet” on climate impacts. Russian rocket attacks killed “dozens” of people in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv as officials from both countries met for ceasefire talks, with Moscow facing unprecedented western sanctions that it said had created “a new economic reality”. The Élysée Palace said after a call between Emmanuel Macron and Vladmir Putin the Russian president was “willing to commit” to ending attacks on civilians and civil infrastructure during the talks. Russia could receive backup from Belarus, who may be preparing to send its soldiers into Ukraine in support of the Russian invasion, according to a US defence official. Meanwhile, the Nigerian government has condemned the treatment of thousands of its students and citizens fleeing the war amid concerns that African students are facing discrimination by security officials and being denied entry into Poland. Companies have also condemned Russia, with Shell announcing it will exit its joint ventures with Russian state energy firm Gazprom a day after BP said it would offload its 20% stake in Kremlin-owned oil firm Rosneft, amid mounting criticism that the oil industry has helped empower Putin. Fifa and Uefa have also acted in unison to suspend Russian teams from international football competition. The United Nations warned of another crisis today: climate change. After the release of the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, the UN warned that even at current levels, human actions in heating the climate are threatening devastation to swathes of the natural world and rendering many areas unliveable. The comprehensive IPCC assessment, based on 34,000 studies, documents “widespread and pervasive” impacts on people and the natural world from increasingly frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, storms and floods. Some impacts are now irreversible. The report, approved by 195 countries, is the “bleakest warning yet” on impacts of climate breakdown. In Australia, it said extreme events exacerbated by emissions – heatwaves, droughts, floods, storms and fires – were causing death, injury and financial and emotional stress. Their impacts were “cascading and compounding” across nature, society and the economy. The flood crisis continues to unfold across two states. Eight people have died, more are missing and hundreds have been rescued as flooding hits Brisbane, Lismore, Murwillumbah and Grafton. Yet the federal government has only used a fraction of $4.8bn emergency fund. The minister for emergency management, Bridget McKenzie, said the federal Emergency Response Fund was “operating as envisaged” despite mounting Labor criticism that it had only spent a fraction of its budget. Labor’s shadow emergency management minister, Murray Watt, has previously criticised the government for what he claimed was a failure to spend money put aside in the ERF, an investment vehicle which began in 2019 with $3.9bn. Meanwhile, the people of Lismore and Kyogle have banded together to rescue neighbours and save homes. Record flooding will force Lismore shire council to rework its new flood management strategy even before it is implemented, and other regions will probably follow suit as insurers tally the cost of worsening climate extremes. These before and after pictures show the full scale of disaster. The New South Wales coroner is considering an inquest into the deaths of four food delivery riders killed in road accidents between October and November 2020. General practitioners should have access to training to provide patients with more advanced mental healthcare in response to the critical shortage of psychiatrists, the peak body for GPs has recommended.

Tim Winton has used his closing address at Perth festival’s Writers Weekend to voice his opposition to the ongoing reliance of Western Australian arts organisations on sponsorship from the fossil fuel industry. Pressure is mounting on Israel to conclude the trial of a Gazan aid worker accused of funnelling relief money to Hamas in a six-year-old case widely derided by the international community as “not worthy of a democratic state”. Over the past decade the two most intense cyclones recorded to date in the southern hemisphere ripped through the Pacific. Tropical Cyclone Pam, the second worst, devastated Vanuatu in 2015 while in 2016 Tropical Cyclone Winston, the worst, ravaged Fiji. Both not only caused extreme environmental damage but economic damage worth 64% and 20% of the respective nations’ GDP. Police leaders in England and Wales will decide not to accept that their forces are still institutionally racist as they try to battle their way out of a race crisis. A senior official has admitted the government knew 15 years before the Grenfell Tower disaster that plastic-filled cladding panels – which fuelled the fatal fire – burned “fast and fierce” and he believed they should not be used on tall buildings. Omar Sakr, a bisexual Turkish-Lebanese Muslim poet, has explored the multiplicity of his identity in literary publications, anthologies and his own poetry collections: These Wild Houses, and the Prime Minister’s Literary Award-winning The Lost Arabs.

3/1/2022,"Smoke injected high into the atmosphere by the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires resulted in a depletion of the ozone layer, new research has found. Scientists have found that the smoke from the devastating bushfires caused a 1% loss in ozone – an amount that typically takes one decade to recover. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy Of Sciences, suggests rising fire intensity and frequency due to the climate crisis may slow the recovery of the ozone layer. The ozone layer – part of the stratosphere, the second layer of Earth’s atmosphere – absorbs ultraviolet radiation emitted by the sun and consists of a high concentration of ozone molecules. Using satellite observations, researchers have found that the smoke aerosols reacted with nitrogen in the stratosphere, resulting in chemical shifts causing the depletion of ozone. Study co-author Dr Kane Stone, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the reduction occurred between March and August 2020. “As the bushfire aerosols leave the stratosphere over time – they come back down to the [Earth’s] surface – ozone depletion stops,” Stone said. “This is a short term decrease, but it’s significant. “We are currently seeing ozone recovery at about a 1% recovery a decade.” Ozone is continuously replenished in the atmosphere above the tropics. “Sunlight reacts with oxygen and it creates ozone,” Stone said. Despite the continual production of ozone, concentrations had been depleted by substances such as chlorofluorocarbons, which were phased out under the 1987 Montreal protocol. Smoke from the 2019–2020 bushfires circumnavigated the globe, blanketing the middle latitudes of the southern hemisphere. The pyrocumulonimbus cloud formed during the event – three times larger than anything previously recorded – ejected smoke particles kilometres upwards into the stratosphere. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The researchers did not study if the bushfire smoke affected the Antarctic ozone hole, which occurs at more southern latitudes and develops annually during the southern hemisphere spring. The director of the centre for atmospheric chemistry at the University of Wollongong who was not involved in the research, Prof Clare Murphy, said more intense fires in the future – as is predicted by current climate models – would slow down the recovery of the ozone layer. “In the stratosphere, the pressure is very low … there’s not a lot of molecules around, so chemistry typically happens very slowly,” Murphy said. “You put [smoke] particles up there and suddenly you provide a surface on which the chemistry can happen many orders of magnitude faster.” Efforts to address the Antarctic ozone hole were a successful example of coordinated environmental action, Murphy said. “There’s no reason that humanity can’t come together and solve the climate issues as well.”",News/Environment,"Smoke from Black Summer bushfires depleted ozone layer, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/01/smoke-from-black-summer-bushfires-depleted-ozone-layer-study-finds
3/1/2022,"Britain has long been a haven for people of negotiable integrity to stash their cash, often via property deals made with the help of an army of lawyers, PR advisers and bankers. Not only are super-mansions in London and the home counties a safe bet from an investment point of view, but the ability to disguise ownership via a labyrinthine network of shell companies offers a degree of anonymity to those who prefer their financial dealings to remain secret. On top of that, the Companies House database – the repository for details of UK-registered businesses – has become almost a punchline to a pretty bad joke. Information is often missing, incomplete or obviously fake. Directors have been registered in the name of Adolf Tooth Fairy Hitler and Judas Superadio Iskariot, without anyone batting an eyelid. Information can be hard to search for and the website crashes or times out on a regular basis. On Monday, amid pressure to crack down on the billions of pounds in Russian “dirty money” flowing through London, the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, brought forward measures designed to clean up the mess. They include a register of properties owned by overseas investors, in theory preventing them from disguising their identities. “By legislating now, we’ll send a clear warning to those who have or are thinking about using the UK property market to launder ill-gotten gains,” Kwarteng said. Companies House will also be “upgraded” to improve the quality of information available from its database and there will be measures to strengthen “unexplained wealth orders”, which give law enforcement bodies the power to seize assets where they suspect criminality may have occurred. Long-time anti-corruption campaigners are relieved, if frustrated at how long it has taken Britain to relinquish its role as obsequious financial butler to what the business department now calls “corrupt elites”. “It’s about bloody time,” said Susan Hawley, executive director of Spotlight on Corruption. She said campaigners had “been waiting six years” for measures like these, ever since an anti-corruption summit in 2016, adding: “These measures are a good start but on their own will not be enough to plug the loopholes in our defences against dirty money. “We need a massive investment in law enforcement capability so they can get on with investigating unexplained wealth, and with investigating and prosecuting money laundering breaches and sanctions evasion.” Already, there is scepticism about whether the super-rich and super-nefarious will be able to flout the rules. For instance, while the “ultimate beneficial owner” of a property will have to be disclosed, that could still be a legal entity or a company. If that entity is itself in a jurisdiction that permits corporate secrecy, there will be no way to unravel the final links in the chain to the person at the very top. Graham Barrow, of the Dark Money Files podcast, has consistently exposed some of the more ludicrous failings of Companies House to provide legitimate data. He pointed out that these rules are similar to those for “persons of significant control” disclosures that, in theory, tell you who owns a company. “We know from experience that they can be circumvented by declaring that there is no one who meets the definition of a ‘beneficial owner’,” he said. “Whilst there are penalties for making a false declaration, knowing who is behind an entity in a location like the Marshall Islands, the Seychelles or BVI is not a straightforward task. “Without adequate human and financial resources, along with cooperation from overseas territories, the requirements look difficult to enforce effectively”. Hawley raised misgivings about measures to target those trying to evade sanctions, a hot-button topic as ministers target Russian oligarchs and Kremlin officials. “It isn’t clear that this bill goes far enough in giving law enforcement the real tools to bring criminal cases for sanction evasion,” she said. “There hasn’t been a criminal sanctions evasion case for over 12 years.” Barrow also declared it “deeply disappointing” that the government was not acting faster. “Companies House continues to be abused on a daily basis and further delay simply opens the door to more and more criminals.” One campaigner, who asked not to be named until he had spent more time analysing the detail, was more sanguine about the prospect of the financial chicanery that may go on as the corrupt and secretive hide their assets elsewhere in the period between the proposals being announced and implemented. “The gate will be open for a while,” he said. “But I’d rather get a decent piece of legislation than try to pass it in three hours. We can’t turn back the clock. We are where we are.”",News/World news,‘It’s about bloody time’: UK finally moves to block Russia’s ‘dirty money’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/its-about-bloody-time-uk-finally-moves-to-block-russias-dirty-money
3/1/2022,"During the second world war, a poster famously read “Careless Talk Cost Lives” – based on the premise that German spies might be in the pub listening out for secret ops being divulged over a pint of beer. Over the past three days, some careless talk at the top of government has served to underline how difficult it is in a modern war for ministers to get their messaging right. Run of the mill ministerial blunders in domestic politics can be tidied up with little consequence, but in a propaganda battle such as this, minor errors and misspeaks can be ruthlessly exploited by Moscow to justify escalation or to sow division. That requires ministers to stick to the broad government script while trying to sound more diverting than an answerphone message. It also requires an unbelievably quick mopping up operation since, in the first major war fully to engage western social media, a lie can be retweeting itself halfway around the world before the truth has got its counter-tweet ready. Hence it took a few hours for the home office minister Kevin Foster to delete his tweet proposing that desperate Ukrainians could come to the UK if they tried some fruit picking. Even on Monday, the home secretary, Priti Patel, was struggling to reconcile her policy with the handling of individual cases. More seriously, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss found her endorsement of British citizens answering Ukraine’s urging to enlist and join an international brigade may have seemed an innocent endorsement of Kyiv’s call. Equally her warning, now frequently made, that Russia may extend its offensive into Nato territory has been picked up by Moscow to justify Russia’s deterrence forces – including nuclear weapons – being put on high alert. It may have been a specious Russian effort to justify an unjustifiable escalation, a point made by Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP leader and no soul sister of Truss, but it also shows the minefield in which politicians are currently walking. In an interview on BBC One’s Sunday Morning programme, the UK foreign secretary had replied “absolutely” when asked whether she would back anyone wanting to volunteer to help the Ukrainians fighting for their freedom. It took the defence secretary Ben Wallace 24 hours to point out Truss’s own department’s travel advice urges British citizens not to travel to Ukraine, and if British people wanted to help, it would be better either to donate financially or even enlist to join the British army. The messaging became worse when the prime minister’s official spokesperson said western sanctions “are to bring down the Putin regime” at a daily briefing on Monday. He said: “The measures we are introducing, that large parts of the world are introducing, are to bring down the Putin regime. “We have introduced widespread sanctions, we aim to inflict financial pain on Putin and his regime to stymie the Russian war machine as it attempts to subjugate a democratic European country.” Downing Street quickly explained the spokesperson had misspoken, explaining: “We’re not seeking anything in terms of regime change. What we’re talking about here clearly is how we stop Russia seeking to subjugate a democratic country.” But again some damage was done since the item was zipping across the newswires, seeping into international media, and being gratefully grasped by Russia to prove this is about a Nato conspiracy to unseat their leader. At root, there is an occasional British intellectual confusion that needs clarifying and policing. Boris Johnson has been at the forefront of those, saying that the west must not only actively help the Ukrainian resistance, but also ensure that Putin fails and is seen to fail, in essence to serve a lesson to autocrats worldwide that the age of impunity cannot chalk up such a famous victory. As the west made clear in the case of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, it is not seeking regime change, but instead for the regime to change. Some will say the distinction is bogus, but it is the difference between legality and illegality. Above all, it is about making sure Conservative politicians, brought to power by playing to a domestic gallery, realise the global gallery is listening just as hard.",News/Politics,Russian invasion is no time for UK ministers’ clumsy messaging,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/28/russian-invasion-is-no-time-for-uk-ministers-clumsy-messaging
3/1/2022,"The Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine is less effective in children aged five to 11 than in adolescents and adults, according to new data from New York state health officials. The new research was announced shortly after federal authorities relaxed masking guidance and a day after Eric Adams, the mayor of New York, said he would probably follow Governor Kathy Hochul in ending a mask mandate in city schools. The study was carried out during the Omicron variant surge but was made public at a time of rapidly dropping cases and hospitalizations in New York and elsewhere. In the study released on Monday, not yet peer-reviewed, six New York state public health scientists analyzed cases and hospitalization rates from 13 December 2021 to 30 January 2022 among 852,384 fully vaccinated children aged 12 to 17 and 365,502 fully vaccinated children aged five to 11. Results revealed that vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization during the Omicron variant surge declined from 85% to 73% for children aged 12 to 17. Among children aged five to 11, effectiveness fell even more significantly, from 100% to 48%. Vaccine effectiveness against testing positive declined from 66% to 51% among children aged 12 to 17. In the younger group, effectiveness dropped from 68% to 12%. In the last week of January, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization among 12-year-olds was 67% – but just 11% for 11-year-olds. “The difference between the two age groups is striking,” Florian Krammer, an immunologist at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine, told the New York Times. He noted that 12-year-olds were administered 30mg of the vaccine, the same dose given to adults. But 11-year-olds were given only 10mg. “This is super interesting because it would almost suggest that it’s the dose that makes the difference … the question is how to fix that,” Krammer said. Eli Rosenberg, the New York state deputy director for science, told the New York Times that although it was disappointing to see the decline in vaccine effectiveness, it should be acknowledged that the Pfizer/BioNTech shot was developed in response to an earlier virus variant. “It looks very distressing to see this rapid decline but it’s again all against Omicron,” he said. Additional research was needed, he said, to determine the best dose to administer to children, taking into consideration factors such as the number and timing of shots. News of the research came shortly after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) outlined new mask guidelines for more than 70% of the US population. The new system changes the CDC risk map and puts more than 70% of the population in counties where coronavirus is posing a low or medium threat to hospitals. Those people can stop wearing masks in many settings, the agency said. Nevertheless, the CDC is still advising that people including schoolchildren wear masks where the risk of Covid-19 is high. That is the situation of approximately 37% of US counties, where about 28% of Americans live.",News/US news,"Pfizer vaccine significantly less effective in children ages five to 11, study shows",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/28/pfizer-vaccine-less-effective-children-ages-five-to-11-data
3/1/2022,"Since the outbreak of fighting last week and after years of reluctance, western countries have promised to send thousands of anti-tank and hundreds of anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine, but they will have to get supplies to the frontline quickly if they are to be effective. Germany in the past few days broke with decades of anti-rearmament tradition to send 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 Stinger anti-aircraft missile systems, while Sweden agreed to send 5,000 next generation light anti-tank weapons (NLAWs). And over the weekend it emerged that the US, for the first time, would send the portable Stingers, badly needed if Ukraine is to prevent Russia gradually gaining air superiority as it tries to close in on Kyiv. Britain and the Netherlands have also agreed to send more weapons, although in the UK’s case details are sketchy. British and other western officials were keen to avoid public discussion of supply lines, although Boris Johnson was pictured at RAF Brize Norton on Saturday in front of a military plane sending humanitarian and “military supplies” to Ukraine. With Ukraine’s airspace closed to Nato planes, experts believe western supplies are being dropped off in Poland before crossing the border by land. For now, routes to key Ukrainian cities remain open, but it is not clear for how long. Nick Reynolds, a land warfare analyst with Rusi, said “the failure of the offensive against Irpin on Sunday leaves two major highways connecting Kyiv and Poland still under Ukrainian control. Likewise, Russian forces do not seem to have been able to encircle Kharkiv, so supply lines there should remain open for now.” That may explain why Russia has been so keen to try to take control of the north-west of Kyiv, starting with the helicopter deployment of special forces on the Hostomel airport on Thursday. But even if that were to change, other less direct routes to the capital from the south remain open. Ukraine’s armed forces have historically been largely reliant on equipment originally made in Russia or before that the Soviet Union, but this has gradually been augmented by western weaponry over the past three years that is now deemed critical to halt the Russian tank-dominated advance. Barack Obama was reluctant to provide Ukraine with any defensive weaponry after Russia’s seizure of Crimea in 2014 when he was president, fearing it could be escalatory, although the US did supply body armour and night vision goggles. The US first supplied $47m (£35m) worth of sophisticated Javelin anti-tank missiles, with a range of 2.5km (1.5 miles), in 2018, although they were not at first delivered to the frontline of the conflict that was ongoing at the time in the Donbas. But the US record of arms supply has been uneven to say the least. In 2019, Donald Trump appeared to threaten to halt further supplies unless Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, provided information about the business dealings in the country of Joe Biden’s son Hunter. The then US president was forced to relent after a leak of the demand became public – an issue that led to his impeachment in the House, although the Senate acquitted him. Other nations have only followed this year, including the UK in January, which sent 2,000 simpler NLAW anti-tank weapons, and Lithuania also sent some Stingers. Experts believed that Ukraine would have about 10 days worth of military supplies, making the need to resupply at all levels pressing. It is hard to get definitive evidence of the use of western equipment in action, although a reliable report from the eastern city of Kharkiv, suggested that NLAWs had helped stop an advance of Russian armour on Thursday, the first day of fighting. “How do you say in English ‘God save the Queen?’” a Ukrainian soldier told the Daily Telegraph. Videos are circulating on social media of a strike on a stationary Russian tank. Ukraine has so far claimed it has shot down 29 Russian planes and 29 helicopters, and taken out 191 tanks. These figures cannot be verified, but there is enough evidence of combat damage to suggest modern western weaponry is helping the defence of the country. Maintaining the supply of western arms is therefore likely to be crucial to the defence of Ukraine.",News/World news,Weapons from the west vital if Ukraine is to halt Russian advance,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/weapons-from-the-west-vital-if-ukraine-is-to-halt-russian-advance
3/1/2022,"First BP, now Shell. The rush to disinvest from Russia is impressively quick since it’s possible to imagine an alternative script in which the oil companies’ boards tried to buy time by issuing woolly “all options are open” statements. A definitive statement to sell its 20% stake in Rosneft (in BP’s case) and ditch all partnerships with Gazprom (Shell’s position) leaves no ambiguity. There can be no going back. The mechanics of the exit are yet to be determined, and BP’s route to disentanglement is probably simpler. The company has had a wild ride in Russia over the years (one minute it was fighting local oligarchs, the next it was in partnership with them), but since 2013 it has been reduced to the role of dividend-collecting passive investor in Rosneft. So it can either seek a buyer or accept whatever token sum of devalued roubles that the Russian company cares to offer. The latter looks more likely. Shell, by contrast, is an active participant in the Sakhalin-2 project that produces about 4% of the world’s LNG and is crucial to Russia’s efforts to develop Asian markets. The joint-venture structure, where Gazprom is the 50% owner, will be harder to dissolve, but, at this point, the intention to exit is what matters. As significant is Shell’s scrapping of a five-year “strategic cooperation agreement” with Gazprom that was signed only last year. That cosy working relationship with Russia’s biggest energy company could not possibly continue. The same goes for the now-ditched involvement in the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. The hit to BP’s share price on Monday was a modest 4% by the close of trading. The message in that movement is that BP can easily afford to say goodbye to its stream of Rosneft dividends for zero compensation. BP had received about $650m annually from Rosneft in recent years and could have been looking at $1bn with oil at $100-plus a barrel. They are large numbers in themselves but consider the context: BP’s operating cashflow was $23.6bn in 2021. The fall in BP’s share price, one can speculate, would have been greater if the board had risked serious reputational damage and tried to ignore the UK government’s entreaties. Oil is always a political business, and there’s no point pretending otherwise. For Shell, the financial impairments should be slighter: the company said it had about $3bn of non-current assets in Russia at the end of 2021, which hardly dents the wider investment case. The Norwegian energy group Equinor has also said it will exit its Russian partnerships, and the French group TotalEnergies will surely follow. These are all public companies that operate in the public spotlight. For the next round of disinvestment, western governments should lean on privately owned western trading companies that are also important players in the Russian energy industry. They are harder to pressure, but they also matter if the disinvestment process is to have bite. GlaxoSmithKline could have safely shelved its long-planned big presentation to the City of its Panadol-to-Sensodyne consumer products division: most of the main financial details were aired in January in response to Unilever’s brief but entertaining £50bn takeover offer for the unit. It was, for an example, a non-revelation that Haleon, as the division has been named, expects to achieve 4-6% organic sales growth over “the medium term”. Nobody will be fundamentally rethinking their valuation thesis as a result of a new show of corporate confidence in the numbers. The same applies to the confirmation that GSK will take a dividend of more than £7bn before a demerger in July. That was almost exactly as predicted. The only mini-surprise is that Pfizer, the US joint venture partner in Haleon, intends to retain its stake, which will emerge at 32% after GSK’s pre-separation dividend shuffle. GSK, by contrast, intends to “monetise” its rump 20% holding, which translates as flogging a few shares at timely moments. Pfizer’s stance is slightly odd because its shareholders are quite capable of buying shares directly in an independent Haleon if they wish. But nobody at GSK will be grumbling: having a long-term major shareholder with two board seats ought to be mildly valuation-supportive. Come back in July to see how close Haleon gets to the value implied by Unilever’s offer. But the arrival in the FTSE 100 of a large UK-based consumer goods giant with reliable cashflows is very welcome. As index investors are learning to their cost, the UK’s blue-chip index is absurdly overpopulated with Russian mining companies.",News/Business,BP and Shell lead rush to exit Russia.

3/1/2022,"Oligarchs and kleptocrats will no longer be able to hide their ownership of property through companies based in overseas territories, the business secretary said on Monday, but refused to give a date for when the change would come into force. In a move brought forward by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Kwasi Kwarteng said there would be a register showing the ultimate beneficial ownership of foreign-owned UK properties – a move that was first promised under David Cameron. He also revealed new powers to seize crypto assets under economic crime legislation that will be brought forward on Tuesday. Kwarteng said the legislation would “send a clear warning to those who have or who are thinking about using the UK property market to launder ill-gotten gains, particularly those linked to the Putin regime.” Labour welcomed the measures outlined by Kwarteng but criticised years of “government inaction”. Seema Malhotra, the shadow business minister, supported the measures “in light of the atrocities we are seeing in Ukraine”, but added: “He will know that Labour, and indeed some on his own side, have been calling for measures the government has announced for years. “We were first promised this legislation in 2016, and in fact this draft legislation has been ready since 2018. While we support the government’s actions today, he needs to take responsibility for the time and progress lost through government inaction.” However, a series of MPs expressed frustration that there was no immediate move to reform Companies House, the register of company ownership, which will only be discussed in a white paper. Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP, said she was “dismayed that all we are getting is a white paper”, saying there was an extensive consultation a year ago giving plenty of suggestions for reforms to prevent wrong, missing and fraudulent records. Liam Byrne said it “was at best a half measure”, highlighting 11,000 shell companies where there is no person of significant control registered – and only 112 prosecutions. MPs also raised concerns about the time it would take to set up the register of beneficial ownership of property, with Robert Jenrick, the Tory former cabinet minister, questioning whether people would be given up to 18 months to declare their ownership. James Murray, a Labour MP, called for owners to have to make declarations by the end of March this year. “Every day we waste now gives those benefiting from Putin longer to hide their dirty money elsewhere,” he said. Kwarteng did not say when the deadline for declaration would be but he said he was working to get the register up and running within “a few months”. He said there was “plenty of scope” for MPs to lay amendments to the legislation if they wanted to. The legislation will establish a new register of overseas entities requiring foreign owners of property in the UK to declare their true identity, in a move intended to ensure criminals cannot hide behind secretive webs of shell companies. Those that fail to comply will have restrictions placed on selling the property, while those who are found to have broken the rules will face up to five years in prison. The legislation will apply retrospectively to property bought by overseas owners up to 20 years ago in England and Wales and since December 2014 in Scotland. The changes proposed for Companies House would give the registrar of companies new powers to maintain the integrity of the register – stamping out erroneous or fraudulent entries and tackling late filing of records. The paper said the new powers would include those to “query suspicious appointments or filings and, in some cases, request further evidence or reject the filing” and more data sharing with law enforcement agencies. It proposed that those setting up, managing, and controlling companies and other registrable entities will have a “verified identity” with Companies House, or have registered and verified their identity via an anti-money laundering supervised third-party agent. The white paper said: “This will make anonymous filings harder and discourage those wishing to hide their company ownership through nominees or opaque corporate structures.” However, it also suggested more privacy for those who own companies could be introduced, with the suggestion that the government “will also enhance privacy mechanisms across the register”. “Anyone whose personal information has been made public on the register in the past will be able to apply to have some of that information suppressed, and we will ensure that individuals who can provide evidence that having their personal information on the public register puts them at risk of harm can apply to have it suppressed,” it said. Boris Johnson, who is travelling to Poland and Estonia on Tuesday, told G7 leaders that he welcomed the “unity of messaging” condemning Russia’s invasion in recent days. A Downing Street spokesman said: “The prime minister stressed the need for countries to continue supporting the Ukrainian government, including with the provision of defensive weapons. He also underlined the need for an international response to the emerging humanitarian crisis, including through supporting Ukraine’s neighbours to deal with large numbers of Ukrainians escaping violence in the country.” He also stressed the need for Russia to be removed from the Swift payment system and further pressure to be applied on Putin’s regime. “The leaders agreed to pursue every avenue to ensure that Putin fails in his ambitions,” the spokesman added.",News/Business,Foreign owners of UK properties to be identified in new register,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/28/foreign-owners-of-uk-properties-to-be-identified-in-new-register
