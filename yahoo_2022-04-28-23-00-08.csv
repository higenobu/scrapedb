4/28/2022,"When Google was a baby start-up, the company was infamous for its Rumpelstiltskin-style questions. To land a job as a program manager, a candidate would have to flounder and guess how many golf balls fit in a bus or create an evacuation plan for the entire city of San Francisco. These questions were irrelevant to the nature of the program manager's role, and they also proved to be unhelpful to Google. In 2013, Google scaled back these questions, as former chief of Google human resources and current CEO of Humu, Laslo Block, told the The New York Times: “We found that brain teasers are a complete waste of time. They don’t predict anything. They serve primarily to make the interviewer feel smart.” But Google is still reportedly asking hardball questions. And Google employees have turned to Blind, the anonymous social app for workplace-related conversations, to discuss the alleged usage of unnecessarily difficult questions in the interview stage. Googlers hate Googlers A Google employee took to Blind on April 24th with a post titled “I hate Googlers,” which now has more than 400 likes and 100 comments. In this self-described “TED talk,” the worker, verified as a Google staffer by Blind’s email process, complains about how questions in the internal bank of interview questions are needlessly difficult and also sometimes wrong. “The people writing the hardest interview questions are always the people with, like, one year at Google and working on something irrelevant like Google Wear and pushing protos. … Why are you asking interview questions that require space partitioning trees or 4D dynamic programming?” the employee said. The original poster claims that sometimes the individual who writes the question will get the answer wrong and take more time to get the correct answer than they give their potential new hire to figure out the question. “It’s common for there to be weeks of discussion around the best solution, or improving already existing solutions, and these are so-called ‘Googlers,’ yet they expect the candidate to do this in an hour,” the employee said. The game then becomes more about appeasing a Silicon Valley employee than proving your worth. Correcting an interviewer is often considered taboo, according to the post. ​​ “Your chance of passing the interview is inversely correlated to the chance you get one of these fragile ego'd interviewers,” says the Blind poster. Individuals in the comments said that this interview process is indicative of larger issues at Google. Said one commenter on this phenomenon, “It’s the embodiment of what’s wrong with Google culture.” Google did not respond to requests for comments.

4/28/2022,"Marjorie Taylor Greene’s double talk on her “Marshall law” text found a friendly ear in Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Wednesday. (Watch the video below.) The far-right House member, who in a text brought up the possibility of Donald Trump imposing martial law to keep himself in power after the 2020 election, said on “The Ingraham Angle” that ... Well, her answers were so convoluted we’re not sure what she said. “Those are reportedly my text messages,” the Georgia Republican told Ingraham. “I think if people read them for themselves, if those are my text message, they clearly say that I wasn’t calling for that. I actually said that’s something I don’t know about.” Ingraham asked if she advocated for martial law. Greene again obfuscated, saying she didn’t remember doing so and questioned if the message was hers. At a hearing earlier, she took a similar tack while being questioned about whether she supported martial law, saying she didn’t “recall.” “In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall law.” the spelling-challenged Greene wrote to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on Jan. 17, 2021. “I don’t know on those things,” she added. “I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!” The text was among many turned over by Meadows, and it was highlighted by CNN recently. A group in Greene’s district has called for a judge to keep her off the ballot for reelection because the 14th Amendment bars insurrectionists from holding office. h/t Media Matters This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.
