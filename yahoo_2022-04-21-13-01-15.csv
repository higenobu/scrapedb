4/21/2022,"A broad sell-off in technology stocks has dragged Cathie Wood’s main Ark Invest fund into the gutter – and it looks like it will take a long time for the popular ETF to dig itself out. The average holding in Ark Innovation (ARKK), Ark Investment Management’s namesake flagship exchange-traded fund, is currently down over 70% from its five-year high, according to fresh data from market research firm Bespoke Investment Group. The rout in ARKK’s portfolio brings the investment vehicle 60% below its peak in February 2021. Shares of ARKK were down 4.7% Wednesday to $56.89 as of 2:23 p.m. ET. Without Tesla (TSLA), Ark Innovation’s largest holding and a relative outperformer compared to other components in the fund, the picture would be even worse. The electric-vehicle maker has fallen only 16.4% from its high on Nov. 4 as of Tuesday’s close — a substantial loss of its value but far less severe than the losses in ARKK’s other stocks. Digital biology company Berkeley Lights (BLI), for example, is down over 94% from its five-year high. When taking into consideration the broader declines, Tesla, which comprises about 10.4% of all holdings, has kept the fund from falling even lower. Moreover, Ark Invest continues to bet heavily that Tesla will help it reach its lofty promises to investors. Earlier this week, Ark Investment Management boosted its already-hefty $3,000 price target on the electric-vehicle maker to $4,600 by 2026, citing its prospective robotaxi business and expectations the company will become more capital efficient. The firm’s bear case for Tesla alone is $2,900 by 2026, roughly three times its current share price and the bull case sees Tesla at $5,800. “Although tuned to our expectations for 2026, we believe our Tesla model is methodologically conservative,” Ark analyst Tasha Keeney said in a recent research note. “We assume that Tesla’s stock will trade like a mature company rather than a high-growth one in 2026.” Of all the stocks in ARKK, nearly half have fallen by at least 75% from their five-year highs, per Bespoke’s data, and only one is positive on the year — Signify Health (SGFY). Bespoke Investment also pointed out that the average stock in the ETF needs to rally 348% to get back to prior highs. “I'm thinking about our clients,” Wood said in a recent interview with Yahoo Finance Live. “They have felt the full force of this decline, and yet we inflowed last year, and we're inflowing this year, and I think that has been shocking to a lot of counterparts out there, who have gone through periods, like we've just experienced, and have had massive outflows.” “I think a few things are at work,” Wood added. “Number one, our long term time horizon is practically the first thing we say, when we're talking to prospective investors.” Wood repeatedly emphasized that a critical feature of Ark’s investment strategy is that it focuses on a five-year time horizon, even calling the 12-18 month time horizon of most traditional asset managers “short-sighted.” When considering that period as a gauge of performance as of recently, ARKK is up only 20% over the last five years. By comparison, the S&P 500 has a five-year return of 91.75%. Ark rose to fame when the fund returned 150% in 2020, but the fund has since erased its post-pandemic gains. Its struggling performance also prompted Morningstar to downgrade its rating on ARKK from Neutral to Negative last month, citing issues with the fund's risk management and ability to navigate the space it aims to explore. “The firm favors companies that are often unprofitable and whose stock prices are highly correlated,” Morningstar strategist Robby Greengold wrote in a note. “Rather than gauge the portfolio’s aggregate risk exposures and simulate their effects during a variety of market conditions, the firm uses its past as a guide to the future and views risk almost exclusively through the lens of its bottom-up research into individual companies.” “Wood has suggested that risk management lies not with her but with those who invest in ARK’s funds. It’s tough to see why that should be so,” Greengold wrote. “ARK could do more to avert severe drawdowns of wealth, and its carelessness on the topic has hurt many investors of late. It could hurt more in the future.” — Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

4/21/2022,"The oldest advice in the financial markets is to buy low and sell high. The trick to winning, however, is to find the right stocks to buy, and to remember that ‘buy low’ doesn’t always mean these stocks can't go lower. Sometimes the best bargains really do come in at the lowest prices. There are plenty of stocks under $10 that won’t break your bank and still offer substantial upside potential. How substantial? Well, one analyst at investment banking giant Morgan Stanley has been tapping two winners among these low-cost stocks, and she sees the upside beginning at 100% or better. We can dig deeper into the Morgan Stanley picks using the TipRanks database, to find why these lost-cost stocks are getting the thumbs up. Rocket Lab USA (RKLB) First up is a California-based company that works in a futuristic niche – space flight. Rocket Lab is a non-governmental space launch company, offering customers access to the Electron small orbital launch vehicle, which it boasts is the second-most frequently launched US rocket. The Electron, which boosts payloads up to 300kg into low Earth orbit, is on the only reusable small launch vehicle in service. Rocket Lab has completed 25 Electron launches to date, successfully deploying 112 satellites into orbit. In a major announcement for the company, Rocket Lab released news that it will attempt a mid-air helicopter recovery of the Electron vehicle’s first stage in the next scheduled launch, later this month. Currently, the company complements the Electron rocket with the Photon customizable orbital spacecraft. Looking forward, Rocket Lab is developing the Neutron rocket, a large-scale reusable launch system, which will be able to deploy a 13,000kg payload into low Earth orbit, or a 1,500kg payload into an orbital trajectory to Mars or Venus. During 2021, Rocket Lab was awarded a contract from the US Space Force, worth $24 million, to complete development of the Neutron’s upper stage. Building on its launch program, and to raise capital for its development program, Rocket Lab entered the public markets in August of last year. The stock’s entry to the NASDAQ came through a business combination with a SPAC firm, Vector Acquisition Corporation, and brought the space launch company as much as $777 million in gross proceeds. Since going public, Rocket Lab has reported fiscal results for three quarters, starting with 2Q21 last September. The company saw zero revenue in that quarter – but reported $5.3 million in 3Q21, which more than quintupled to $27.5 million in 4Q21. Full-year revenue for 2021 came in at $62.2 million, up 77% year-over-year. Kristine Liwag, Morgan Stanley’s resident expert on the Aerospace & Defense sector, sees the upcoming helicopter retrieval attempt as the key catalyst for Rocket Lab, writing: “We view RKLB’s upcoming mid-air booster retrieval attempt as a potential near-term catalyst as a successful operation would reflect a key milestone as the company executes on its strategy to increase rocket reusability (and thus lower cost).” Going on, Liwag points out how this retrieval capability will set Rocket Lab apart from its peers: “We view the company’s ongoing and planned innovations in rocket reusability enabling Rocket Lab to potentially further widen the moat between itself and competitors... These innovations could enable recovery of ~70-80% of each rocket’s economic value, allowing Rocket Lab to potentially further drive down vehicle costs and insulate itself from potential pricing pressures engendered by rival small launch offerings and rideshare services.” In line with her comments, Liwag rates Rocket Lab shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), with a $17 price target to imply a robust 109% upside for the stock. (To watch Liwag’s track record, click here) Overall, with 6 recent Buy ratings overpowering a single Hold, Rocket Lab gets a Strong Buy from the analyst consensus. The shares are priced at $8.11, and their $18.86 average target suggests ~133% upside from that level. (See RKLB stock forecast on TipRanks) Joby Aviation (JOBY) Sticking with the Aerospace realm, we’ll look over at Joby Aviation. This is a mid-cap firm, working on development of a new urban commuter aircraft. Joby’s proposed aircraft is an electrically powered vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) model, designed for the urban air taxi niche. Joby has demonstrated the concept through small-scale remotely controlled drones, and is currently testing a full-sized prototype. The company is aiming for FAA type certification next year. Joby’s prototype commuter aircraft uses six electric motors, in a tilt-rotor configuration. The engines are aligned at the leading edges of the wing and tail surfaces, in a layout that optimizes motor and rotor efficiency. Joby’s concept plane has 5 seats – a pilot and four passengers – plus room for passenger luggage, and is designed to fly up to 150 miles on a full battery charge, with a top speed at 200 mph. Last year, in August, Joby completed a SPAC combination with Reinvent Technology Partners, and entered the NYSE on August 11. The company’s realized proceeds, plus cash on hand, brought the balance sheet to $1.6 billion after the business combination. The company is highly speculative, but last year, while the SPAC combo was in planning and in progress, Joby achieved several milestones. The pre-production prototype aircraft flew a total of 5,300 miles in test flights. That total included a flight on 154.6 miles on a single battery charge – the longest single flight, and an important proof-of-concept for the prototype’s proposed performance. Joby has also completed construction of its second pre-production prototype, and the first FAA production conformity inspection. Once again, we’ll check in with Morgan Stanley’s Kristine Liwag, who lays out this aircraft maker’s strengths: “Joby continues to progress on their path to aircraft certification with meaningful steps forward in the certification and manufacturing process, along with strides in pushing the flight envelope of the aircraft. The company made meaningful progress in the certification process as it began manufacturing conformity testing and completed their first Systems and Compliance Reviews with the FAA.” ""Strides were made on the manufacturing front as the company began the manufacturing of their first production-intent aircraft. The design of the aircraft is yet to be frozen, but the idea is to have more conforming production with each passing aircraft across the line,"" Liwag added. Overall, Liwag believes this is a stock worth holding on to. The analyst rates JOBY shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and her $16 price target indicates room for 209% one-year upside potential. (To watch Liwag’s track record, click here) With 2 Buy ratings and 1 Hold assigned in the last three months, the word on the Street is that JOBY is a Moderate Buy. Not to mention the $11.33 average price target brings the upside potential to ~121% from the current trading price of $5.14.

4/21/2022,"Netflix (NFLX) shares are tanking 35% on Wednesday afternoon, their worst daily performance since 2004 after an unexpected decline in first-quarter net subscribers. “I think what we got here was a significant disappointment,"" Truist Securities equity research director Matthew Thornton told Yahoo Finance Live. “The real culprit here is churn,"" he said. ""That’s why you’re seeing the surprise, and that’s why you’re seeing the violent reaction this morning,” he added. (Churn is the rate at which subscribers discontinue their service.) The streaming giant lost subscribers upon exiting Russia following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine — and amid an increasingly saturated North American market. “Some of it was macro related, and some of it is industry related,” said Thornton. Netflix has been increasing prices in the U.S., Canada and other countries, and devising ways to prevent account sharing. Streaming-related stocks like Disney (DIS) and Roku (ROKU) were under pressure on Wednesday in sympathy with Netflix. Though the landscape for streamed content has become crowded, “most of the competitors really don’t have the same geographic footprint or exposure, at least not yet, that Netflix has,” added Thornton. Netflix's decline in new subscribers was a surprise to Wall Street. Analyst had been expecting decelerating, but still positive growth for the first quarter of 2022. The company says it expects an even steeper drop in new users for the current quarter. ""Our relatively high household penetration — when including the large number of households sharing accounts — combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds,"" Netflix said in a letter to shareholders. ""The big COVID boost to streaming obscured the picture until recently.""

4/21/2022,"We all know how the markets started this year by falling into correction territory. Electric Vehicle (EV) stocks were no exception, although there was no clear trend in the segment. Major EVs have fallen between 5% and 50% year-to-date, compared to the S&P 500’s 6% drop. Inflation is a key to understanding that performance. EVs will require new factory processes in their manufacture, and new sets of raw materials – and those raw materials don’t come cheap. A combination of increasing demand, production bottlenecks, and a snarled distribution chain have pushed up prices for lithium, nickel, and cobalt, vital battery metals, anywhere from 16% to 70%. And in addition to metals, auto companies are finding it difficult to procure everything from semiconductor chips to window glass to flooring carpets. The result is a surge in EV prices, which on average now run some $10,000 per unit higher than combustion vehicles. But this isn’t the only chapter in the story. EVs are also showing rapid technological improvements, with battery efficiency and vehicle range closing in on gasoline vehicle averages, and charging infrastructure expanding its footprint and adding newer ‘fast charging’ stations. We don’t know what the final look of the EV market will be; it’s clearly still evolving, and we’re in the early stages of the shift – but the consensus among the sector experts is, the future is electric. And that’s the underlying fact which will provide support for EV stocks. If there’s a demand for the product, then that demand will get filled – and that will open up opportunities for investors. To get a picture of those opportunities, as they now stand, we’ve used the TipRanks database to pinpoint three EV stocks that give investors a chance to ‘buy the dip,’ at least according to the analyst community. Lion Electric Company (LEV) We’ll start with a Canadian company, Quebec-based Lion Electric. This automaker focuses on some specific niches – fully electric school busses, urban transit busses, and commercial trucks. The company is one of North America’s largest EV manufacturers, and in addition to its line of 7 vehicles, Lion offers customers additional services such as parts & services, charging infrastructure, and financing. The company bills its vehicles – especially the flagship school busses – as turnkey solutions, and includes technician and driver training in the package. Lion boasts that all of its vehicles, of which some 550 are currently on the road, are zero-emission. By staking out a niche – school busses and commercial trucks – with essential needs, Lion has positioned itself to readily compete for sales, and has seen recent successes. In the last two months of 2021, Lion had orders from two companies, both in Canada, for school busses, totaling 255 units. These orders will begin delivery this year, and continue through 2025 and 2026. More recently, on April 4, Lion announced another Quebec-based school bus order, for 50 units, with deliveries to start in 1Q23. On the commercial truck side, Lion earlier this month launched a new lightweight, all-electric heavy-duty truck for the urban ‘last mile’ delivery market. Urban last mile delivery is a niche well-suited to electric vehicles, as the trucks can remain within easy range of their base for charging. Lion’s new vehicle features a chassis and box that is 40% than previous models. Lion will release its 1Q22 numbers in May, but we can get a feel for the company’s position by a look at its last report, for 4Q21. The company delivered 71 vehicles that quarter, up by 25 units from the 46 deliveries in 4Q20. Top line revenue came in at $22.9 million, up 69% year-over-year – and the highest quarterly revenue of 2021. The company ran net losses in Q1 and Q2 of last year, but turned profitable in Q3 and Q4, with Q4 EPS coming in at 14 cents. Despite these gains, the shares are down 29% this year. In the eyes of Canaccord’s 5-star analyst Jed Dorsheimer, Lion is an EV maker with plenty of potential going forward. He writes, “Lion Electric has a first mover advantage in the EV school bus market... With an order book of 2000+ units, Lion Electric is well positioned to capitalize on electrification of this segment... Lion is leveraging its success in the school bus market to fund the build-out of a wider portfolio of chassis to increase penetration in a range of CEV segments..."" ""With nearly 600k units of Class 4-8 trucks sold annually in North America, we believe Lion Electric is positioned to be one of the first to market with a flexible manufacturing platform that can serve several commercial fleet applications. Success in school buses provides a platform into other key CEV segments with large and growing TAMs,” the analyst added. All of the above makes it clear why Dorsheimer is now standing with the bulls. The top-rated analyst gives LEV a Buy rating along with a $12 price target. This figure reflects his belief in ~74% upside over the next 12 months. (To watch Dorsheimer’s track record, click here) Overall, LEV has picked up a Moderate Buy rating from the Street, based on 6 recent analyst reviews that include 4 Buys and 2 Holds. The stock is selling for $6.91 and its $13 average price target indicates room for 88% growth in the year ahead. (See LEV stock forecast on TipRanks) Lucid Group (LCID) Next up is Lucid Group, a California-based company stepping into the luxury EV segment. Lucid has several models in production, and is in the process of building out its manufacturing facilities to accommodate its customer reservations, which currently stand at more than 25,000. The company’s vehicles feature high performance, range between 400 and 500 miles, and are priced between $95,000 and $169,000. Lucid went public last summer, through a SPAC transaction with Churchill Capital Corporation. The merger saw the LCID ticker enter the NASDAQ on July 26. The stock has been volatile since then, however, and Lucid’s shares are down 45% year-to-date. Since going public, Lucid has released two earnings reports, for Q3 and Q4 of 2021. In the Q4 report, the company noted over 125 vehicle deliveries by the end of 2021, and a total of 300 as of February 28, 2022. Production has exceeded 400 vehicles, and the company foresees a total of 14,000 units produced by the end of this year. Ramping production and delivers have turned on the company’s revenue stream. Lucid reported $26.4 million at the top line in Q4, up 626% year-over-year. The company had over $6.2 billion in cash on hand as of the end of 2021. Covering this stock for BNP Paribas, 5-star analyst James Picariello explains why Lucid’s start in the luxury segment will lead to expanded opportunities in the larger EV universe: “LCID will not have any problems competing in a much more hypercompetitive EV environment, as its full, in-house, vertically integrated powertrain system does all the talking. For a ~$36B market cap company, our sense after several conversations with the Co. and a few investors, is that LCID’s powertrain prowess can be much better understood."" ""We also believe 'on paper' its positioning within the luxury vertical has less of a broader appeal. Once its unique, global-leading powertrain efficiency is properly appreciated, this is when a tipping point should take place for all investors, current and new, in the stock to realize just how large the LCID TAM truly is, as well as just how extensive the Co. can outcompete other OEMs on either performance or cost, and typically, BOTH,” the analyst added. To this end, Picariello rates LCID an Outperform (i.e. Buy), along with a price target of $45. Investors could be pocketing gains of ~116%, should Picariello's forecast hit the mark over the next 12 months. (To watch Picariello’s track record, click here) The projection amongst Picariello's colleagues is for plenty of upside, too. The average price target stands at $40.50 and suggests 94% of share gains over the next 12 months. Overall, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating, based on 3 Buys and 1 Sell. (See LCID stock forecast on TipRanks) Fisker, Inc. (FSR) The last stock we'll look at is Fisker, a California-based EV maker established by the well-known automotive luxury designer – and BMW vet – Henrik Fisker. Fisker is working to promote his Ocean all-electric SUV, which debuted at the 2021 LA Auto Show. The vehicle features a solar-panel roof and is on track to enter regular production later this year. In addition to the Ocean, Fisker is also now accepting reservation for its second vehicle, the PEAR (Personal Electric Automotive Revolution). This 5-seat EV will start at $29,900, and is scheduled for deliveries in 2024. The PEAR will be produced in Ohio, and the company anticipates a production rate of 250,000 units annually. Currently, Fisker is operating with minimal revenue, making the stock highly speculative. The shares get support from the industry’s overall faith that Henrik Fisker can live up to his reputation for results. While he has delivered in the past, and his company has a disciplined cash spending plan, the stock is still vulnerable to market volatility – and FSR is down 27% year-to-date. Investors can find some additional good news in the company’s recent 4Q21 report. Fisker had $1.2 billion in cash available at the end of 2021, which is considered enough to fund the production launch of the Ocean this coming November. That launch is, in turn, supported by customer reservations currently exceeding 40,000. So far, 2022’s reservation pace for the Ocean is up 400% compared to last year. Fisker is currently running a production line for 2 prototype Ocean vehicles per day, which are used in the company’s global certification test and validation program. Let’s check in with BNP Paribas' James Picariello again, as the EV expert has covered FSR, too. The analyst notes the PEAR as a valuable ‘second act’ for Fisker, but points to the Ocean as the key factor for investors to consider. “If there is going to be demand for the Fisker Ocean, we are certain of its supply and build quality. Given the highly affordable price points of the Ocean, and deliberate attempts to separate it from the old guard through offerings such as a lifetime Flex-Lease option, we think the Ocean has all the makings to work,"" Picariello opined. The analyst summed up, ""We consider FSR to be an intriguing way to play the EV space in a smaller cap fashion and gain exposure to a company that is making deliberate strategic decisions far away enough from the OEM mainstream, not only to be interesting, but also to take some risks off the list, as opposed to adding more."" In Picariello’s view, this adds up to an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating, and his $22 price target implies an upside of ~90% in the next 12 months. All in all, Fisker has picked up 7 recent analyst reviews in recent weeks, with 6 Buys and 1 Hold making for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock’s $22.17 average price target suggests it has ~92% upside from the current trading price of $11.55.

4/21/2022,"Meta's stock (FB) remains a dog with fleas, especially going into the company's April 27 Q1 2022 earnings report. That is the hot take from veteran tech analyst Mark Mahaney at EvercoreISI, who slapped the stock with a short-term negative rating. ""I think the expectations are going to be super low,"" Mahaney said on Yahoo Finance Live. ""I think we will see signs of brand advertising weakness out of Western Europe. I guess currency headwinds will be a bit of an issue. The cautious comments from Mahaney are not without good reason. It's almost hard to imagine a darker day for the parent company of Facebook than Feb. 3, 2022. Shares crashed 26% by the close of trading after a very disappointing fourth quarter and outlook. Facebook said it added just 2 million monthly active users in the quarter, barely moving the needle from the prior quarter. In the third quarter, the platform added 15 million monthly active users. Daily active users fell by 1 million as Facebook saw increased competition from TikTok. The company missed analysts' profit estimates by a whopping 14 cents. For 2022, Facebook saw slowing growth and a $10 billion hit from privacy changes to Apple's iOS operating system. The stock's slide wiped away $251.3 billion in market value from Meta. It marked the biggest one-day loss in value for any U.S. company ever. Shares of Meta have largely flat-lined since that report as Wall Street braces for another financial shoe to drop. In the wake of Netflix's shockingly bad quarter and market reaction, the Street is right to be nervous about Meta. Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

But Nabiullina told parliament Monday that 52 institutions from 12 countries are participating. Until recently, the list was posted on the central bank’s website. “Under the current circumstances we decided not to disclose on the website the list of companies connected to the system,” the press service said. “The users of the system can still see the list.” Russia set up the system in 2014 after the first waves of sanctions over Ukraine. Nabiullina told legislators Tuesday that the central bank will continue its push to add new members, according to Interfax. “Until there was such a threat of being cut off from SWIFT, foreign partners weren’t in much of a rush to join, but now we expect their readiness to be greater,” she said. The list of participants is only one of several items that have disappeared from the central bank’s website in the weeks since the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, which triggered sanctions on the Bank of Russia itself. On Tuesday, the central bank said that it will no longer publish quarterly data on the schedule for repayments of foreign debt. Previously, it suspended release of some detailed information on its reserves.

4/21/2022,"Making sense of the markets these days is no easy trick. Inflation is stubbornly high, and rising. The Federal Reserve has embarked on a policy of rate hikes and monetary tightening in response, but there are serious worries that their new path is a matter of too little, too late. The war in Ukraine and further Chinese COVID-lockdowns have promised further shortages of vital commodities and products, just as supply chains were beginning to untangle themselves. It’s no wonder that the big market trend of 2022 so far has been a huge increase in volatility. Following the insiders is one way to find stocks that are worth buying. After all, the insiders, under scrutiny from shareholders, Boards of Directors, and Federal regulators, don’t trade their own company shares lightly. But how do you know which insiders to follow? Are all insider trades made equal? They’re not, of course. Some are simple stock adjustments, to fit shareholdings into corporate salary structures, others are related to bonus or severance compensation. But some insider trades are really worth noticing. The Insiders’ Hot Stocks tool, at TipRanks, offers the filters to sift through these trades and find those nuggets – trades that get into the millions, and are sure to raise eyebrows. We’ve used that data to locate two stocks that have seen recent insiders trades of that impressive magnitude. They made for an interesting bunch, Buy-rated equities with plenty of upside potential, according to the analyst community. Let’s take a closer look. Braze (BRZE) We’ll start in the world of multichannel digital marketing, where Braze, a New York-based company, offers a cloud-based software package for customer engagement. The platform is scalable, with tools for data analytics and optimization, giving marketers options for retail and e-commerce, media and entertainment, customer onboarding, and improved acquisitions. In short, Braze makes it possible to connect customers with brands. The company is no newcomer to the digital marketing world. It was founded in 2011, and has built up its niche with a loyal enterprise customer over 1,300 strong. Braze saw its users sent over 1.5 trillion messages through its platform in fiscal year 2022, and saw 64% year-over-year revenue growth to boot. All of that helps explain the company’s eye-popping IPO. Braze went public on November 17, 2021, putting 7.5 million shares up for sale directly at an initial price of $65 each. The shares jumped up to $95 early on their first day of trading, and closed that day north of $93. The company raised more than $435 million in gross proceeds from the sale, and reached a market value of $5.9 billion. Since then, however, the shares have fallen by half, and the company’s market cap now stands at $4.38 billion. From an investor’s perspective, however, there is still plenty of potential here. Braze has issued two quarterly reports since going public, and shown consistent year-over-year revenue growth. For fiscal 3Q22, the company showed $64 million at the top line, up 60% y/y, and for Q4 that number grew to $70.4 million, up 64% from the prior year. The company’s dollar-based net retention in fiscal Q4 reached 128%. On a cautionary note, Braze is still reporting quarterly net losses, of 16 cents per share in fiscal Q3 and 18 cents in Q4. Turning to the insiders, we find that two Board members have made substantial buys in Braze stock in the last couple of weeks. Director Douglas Pepper made two purchases, totaling 399,718 shares, spending a total of $15 million on the stock. He was joined in this move by Matthew Jacobson, also a company Director, who made purchases of the same size, as the same price. The insiders aren’t the only bulls here. JMP’s 5-star analyst Patrick Walravens is enthusiastic about Braze, writing: “We like Braze for several reasons, including: 1) the company is disrupting a large and growing total addressable market opportunity, estimated at ~$16B in the U.S. alone and has multiple vectors to attack that TAM; 2) Braze is built on a stream processing architecture (vs. batch processing used by most competitors) that optimizes timeliness, receiving and responding to first-party customer data as it occurs in real time; 3) the company posted 64% organic revenue growth in F4Q22, its fourth quarter of acceleration..."" It should be unsurprising, then, that Walravens rates BRZE an Outperform (i.e. Buy). Not to mention, his $75 price target puts the upside potential at ~60%. (To watch Walravens’ track record, click here) It’s not often that the analysts all agree on a stock, so when it does happen, take note. BRZE’s Strong Buy consensus rating is based on a unanimous 12 Buys. The stock’s $68.64 average price target suggests ~46% upside from the current share price of $46.99. (See BRZE stock forecast on TipRanks) TeraWulf, Inc. (WULF) Next up, TeraWulf, is a bitcoin miner, one of many companies that have formed to ride the mounting crypto wave. Since the advent of cryptocurrencies, the cost of mining has increased tremendously, as the computing needs to calculate the next blockchain link increase, and increase again. Crypto mining firms bring together the resources – in capital, in computing capacity, and in energy production – to make those calculations in an economically viable way. The firms profit directly from the bitcoins mined by their operations. TeraWulf's ‘hook’ for investors is its claim of 90% carbon-free energy to support its mining ops. Bitcoin mining is enormously energy intensive, and environmental pollution from power generation has always been a concern in the industry. TeraWulf boasts that the power needs for its two facilities, in New York State and in Pennsylvania, are almost entirely derived from carbon-free nuclear, hydro, or solar sources. Getting to the nitty gritty, TeraWulf aims to become the largest North American crypto miner by 2025, with plans to have 800 megawatts of power capacity and more than 23 EH/s of mining capabilities up and running by the end of that year. TeraWulf was formed in 2021, and later that year merged with IKONICS Corporation. Through that merger, TeraWulf saw the WULF ticker start trading on the NASDAQ on December 14, 2021. The shares close their first day at $20.30, and are since down by 71%. While most of that drop has come during the market volatility this year, a portion of it came in the past week; TeraWulf announced on April 12 the pricing of a new sale of stock, to raise over $20 million. Share prices were hit by fears of dilution. At least one insider, however, bought big. Paul Prager, CEO and Board Member, made a $2.5 million purchase of 317,259 shares. This followed a buy last month, of 396,447 shares, that totaled $3.076 million. Joining the bulls on this crypto miner, B. Riley analyst Lucas Pipes, rated 5-stars by TipRanks, sees serious potential in this stock. He writes, “While WULF is relatively early in deployment and just completed its first installations at Lake Mariner, we believe the company has an industry-leading growth profile over the next 24 months... Despite the company's impressive growth profile, favorable ESG position, and low-cost power, WULF continues to look highly discounted compared to its peer group."" To this end, Pipes gives WULF a Buy rating to go along with this bullish outlook, and quantifies it with a $24 price target to indicate potential for ~322% upside in the year head. (To watch Pipes’ track record, click here) Some stocks slip under the radar, picking up a few analyst reviews, and this is one. Pipes is the only review on record for TeraWulf, which is currently trading at $5.83 per share.

4/21/2022,"By Svea Herbst-Bayliss (Reuters) -Billionaire investor William Ackman liquidated a $1.1 billion bet on Netflix on Wednesday, locking in a loss of more than $400 million as the streaming service's stock plunged following news that it lost subscribers for the first time in a decade. Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management made an abrupt U-turn, selling the 3.1 million shares it had bought just three months ago as Netflix' shares tumbled 35% to $226.19. In January, the investor funneled over $1 billion into the streaming service just days after a disappointing forecast for subscriptions pushed the share price lower. Now a second bout of negative news about subscribers - the company said it had lost 200,000 - prompted the fund manager to turn his back on a company he had showered with praise only weeks before. In a brief statement announcing the move, Ackman said proposed business model changes, including incorporating advertising and going after non-paying customers, made sense but would make the company too unpredictable in the short term. ""While Netflix's business is fundamentally simple to understand, in light of recent events, we have lost confidence in our ability to predict the company's future prospects with a sufficient degree of certainty,"" he wrote. Pershing Square, which now invests $21.5 billion, buys shares in only about a dozen companies at a time and needs a ""high degree of predictability"" in its portfolio companies, Ackman said. Rather than wait around for things to improve at Netflix, Ackman locked in losses that are calculated to be more than $400 million, people familiar with the portfolio said. After the sale, Pershing Square's portfolios are off roughly two percent for the year, Ackman said. Netflix said it had lost 200,000 subscribers in its first quarter, falling well short of its modest predictions that it would add 2.5 million subscribers. Its decision in early March to suspend service in Russia after it invaded Ukraine resulted in the loss of 700,000 members. Profitable hedges helped Pershing Square survive the early days of the pandemic in 2020 and then again in recent months as interest rates began to rise. The last three years have been among the best in the hedge fund's lifetime, including a 70.2% gain in 2020. But Ackman also acknowledged in his statement on Wednesday that he had learned from leaner times when his fund backed Valeant Pharmaceuticals, a disastrous bet that cost the hedge fund billions in losses. ""One of our learnings from past mistakes is to act promptly when we discover new information about an investment that is inconsistent with our original thesis. That is why we did so here,"" he wrote.

4/21/2022,"Make no mistake: The drop in Netflix’s (NFLX) subscriber count is a major setback for the company, Manhattan Venture Partners Head of Research Santosh Rao told Yahoo Finance (video above). “This is a body blow to the bull case — definitely to the Netflix story, the subscriber story,” said Rao. “Netflix was all about subscribers for so long… and it's really taking it on the chin here.” Netflix’s stock tanked in response to its latest round of earnings, as shares dropped by more than 35% in after-hours trading on Wednesday. After withdrawing from Russia due to its invasion of Ukraine, Netflix lost about one million subscribers and clocked a net loss of 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter of 2022. The Internet’s abuzz with theories as to what could be behind the decline and what the company should do next, from too much subscriber churn to talk of Netflix’s exploration of an ad-supported subscription. But one thing is clear, said Rao — that it’s time for Wall Street to revamp its expectations. “The whole story has to be re-evaluated from a lower base now,” he said. “The multiples are getting compelling at this point, but we need to see that the growth story is still intact and they have a strategy to tackle the challenges ahead.” Despite the markets’ reaction to earnings, bright spots for Netflix could be on the horizon as it looks to adjust, given the release of much-awaited content like the latest seasons of “Stranger Things,” “Peaky Blinders,” and “The Umbrella Academy.” Wall Street’s also intrigued by the company’s newly-announced efforts to offer an ad-supported subscription, as well as its efforts to wrangle password-sharing. Raymond James analyst Andrew Marok especially views the possible ad-supported offering as a significant positive, he wrote in an April 20 note. He also added that the company has solid operating margins. “Netflix recorded 1Q22 operating margins of 25.1% vs. guidance of 22.3%, driven by cost efficiencies,” wrote Marok. As Netflix finds its way forward, the company’s going to need to expand both its content strategy and geographic reach, said Rao. “They need to get into some other sticky things – like more gaming, maybe sports, advertising revenue, of course,” he said. “There are all these additional levers that they need to pull, because this is not working. The traditional core business may have peaked, especially in their core markets.” There are many ways forward for Netflix, though perhaps the most important of them is international growth. India and Japan are key growth markets for Netflix, and there’s room to keep building out the platform’s footprint in EMEA, said Rao. Netflix agrees, per its shareholder letter, which delineated the ways the company is setting itself up to thrive internationally. “To support this, we’ve been building out capabilities like creative development, personalization, and language presentation/localization,” the company said in its shareholder letter. “Netflix is now producing films and TV in more than 50 countries with a high degree of integration in the local entertainment ecosystem resulting in the creation of blockbusters from every region. In fact, three out of our six most popular TV seasons of all time are non-English language titles: Squid Game, La Casa de Papel Part 4 and All Of Us Are Dead.” It’s imperative that Netflix approaches these markets with a “more localized strategy” and competitive pricing, added Rao.

4/21/2022,"By Arunima Kumar (Reuters) -Kinder Morgan Inc surpassed Wall Street estimates for first-quarter profit on Wednesday as strong demand for jet fuel and natural gas boosted volumes at the U.S pipeline operator. Exports of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe have hit record levels after Moscow's invasion of Ukraine as the European Union tries to cut its dependence on Russian energy. That has come as a boon for U.S. pipeline operators, with Kinder Morgan - which transports nearly half of the natural gas in the country - posting a 2% rise in volumes of the commodity. The company expects the trend to continue, saying that its present LNG export facilities would likely run at capacity for the foreseeable future. ""The U.S. will be a major supplier of additional LNG to Europe to replace at least in part Russian gas,"" Executive Chairman Richard Kinder said on a call with analysts. The results for the January-March quarter also got a boost from the resurgence in air travel, with volumes of jet fuel transported surging 38%. But net income attributable to the company fell to $667 million, or 29 cents per share, from $1.41 billion, or 62 cents per share, a year earlier. Last year, the company had benefited from a winter storm that boosted demand for natural gas and electricity. Excluding that impact, earnings per share rose 17%, the company said. On an adjusted basis, Kinder Morgan earned 32 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 29 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

4/21/2022,"There are few stock segments more polarizing than the ‘pennies.’ These are low-cost equities, typically priced below $5 per share, and they elicit two distinct responses from investors. Some buyers can’t get away from the pennies fast enough; while for others, these shares have a magnetic attraction. And no matter what any particular investor thinks of the pennies, it’s impossible to deny that these stocks present a fascinating picture of advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side of that ledger, the penny stocks offer what is likely the market’s best possible combination of entry cost and potential gain. At their low price, investors can pick up more shares on a budget – and by starting so low, even a small gain in absolute value will quickly turn into a large gain by percentage of investment. However, it’s wise to remember that there could be a very good reason these shares are priced so low. The key here is to find the difference between penny stocks whose price low due to poor fundamentals, and those whose prices are low due more to bad luck or simple prevailing market conditions. And that’s where investment banking firm Roth Capital comes in. The firm's analysts, who specialize in the small-cap segment of the market, have picked out two penny stocks for particular attention. In Roth’s view, they both ripe for a surge to $15 or more. Using TipRanks’ database, we learned that the stocks they’ve tagged as winners have earned a ‘Strong Buy’ consensus rating from the rest of the Street as well. Syros Pharmaceuticals (SYRS) We'll start with Syros Pharma, a clinical-stage biotech company working on new small-molecule therapeutic agents. The company’s drug candidate programs are designed to control and modify gene expression as an approach for the treatment of cancer and genetic diseases. Syros currently has three programs at various stages of clinical trials. The most advanced clinical candidate is tamibarotene, an orally dosed, selective retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) agonist. The drug candidate is under development as a treatment for genetic diseases defined by overexpression of the RARA gene; the drug targets a genomically defined subset of patients in this category. Tamibarotene is undergoing two clinical trials. The Phase 3 SELECT-MDS-1 trial focuses on RARA-positive patients with newly diagnosed higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS), while the Phase 2 SELECT-AML-1 trial is testing the drug in RARA-positive patients with newly diagnosed unfit acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Syros is on track to report data from the Phase 2 trial in the second half of this year, while data from the Phase 3 trial is due in 4Q23 or 1Q24. Tamibarotene was recently granted Orphan Drug Status by the FDA for the treatment of HR-MDS. The company’s second drug candidate program is SY-2101, or oral arsenic trioxide (ATO), under development as a treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in newly diagnosed patients. The trial is expected to show pharmacokinetic and safety data from the dose confirmation trials by the middle of this year, and is scheduled to initiate a Phase 3 pivotal trials in 1Q23. Syros also has an active Phase 1 trial program for SY-5609, an oral CDK7 inhibitor. This early stage trial is testing the drug candidate against several cancers, including relapsed/refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer, BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer, and relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies. Data from this trial is expected late this year and on into 2023. In addition to an active clinical program, Syros is fortunate enough to have a modest revenue stream, derived from collaboration agreements with Global Blood Therapeutics and Incyte Corporation. In its last reported quarter, 4Q21, Syros received $6.5 million from the former and $1.3 million from the latter. As there are multiple potential catalysts on the horizon, Roth Capital analyst Zegbeh Jallah argues that its $0.95 share price reflects an attractive entry point. ""With three readouts ahead, we struggle to understand why Syros trades at [$0.95]... Recall, that ongoing is a Phase 2 (SELECT-AML) study of Tamibarotene + VenAza in ND unfit RARa+ AML patients, and data from the safety lead-in portion remains on track for 2H2022, which could be a major catalyst... Also recall that SY-2101 is being evaluated in a Phase 3-dose-confirmation study, and safety/PK data are on track for mid-2022. Safety, PK and dosage data were already established in a Phase 1 study, however, management wanted reassurance that the right dose will be moved into Phase 3, and the study also allows for a comparison of the oral vs IV ATO that has already been shown to be effective. Thus, we can expect additional PK to establish that the overall exposure profile makes sense for an oral drug, and the convenience of SY-2101 could be a game-changing for patients,"" Jallah wrote. In line with his optimistic take, Jallah rates SYRS a Buy. The analyst also sets a price target of $23, suggesting a whopping upside of 2,346% in the next 12 months. (To watch Jallah’s track record, click here) Roth Capital is hardly the only Wall Street firm bullish on this stock, or a bit confused by the low price. Syros has a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 6 recent analyst reviews. At $16.83, the average price target brings the upside potential to 1638%. (See SYRS stock forecast on TipRanks) Agrify (AGFY) Now let’s change gears, and take a look at an agricultural company. Agrify is a leader in indoor growing systems, and provides advanced tech for cultivation and extractions solutions in the cannabis industry. The company’s chief product is its Vertical Farming Unit (VFU) system, a proprietary micro-environment-controlled indoor growing technology, which allows for higher yields per square foot, greater consistency of product, and a stronger ROI at any scale. Agrify is set to release its 1Q22 financial results next month, but we can get a feel for the company’s status by looking back at the fourth-quarter results. The company's top line came in at $25.3 million, up 481% from the year-ago quarter. The full-year revenue was up 395% year-over-year to $59.9 million. Agrify reported $377 million in new bookings for 2021, up 919% from the $37 million in bookings from 2020. Looking forward, the company has a work backlog totaling $837 million, up 1,319% from the previous year, and a strong indicator of future business. Turning to customer agreements, early this month Agrify announced a partnership with the multi-state cannabis grower Greenlight to encourage and accelerate the adoption of Vertical Farming Units. Next, on April 11, Agrify announced an agreement with Loud Wellness for the installation of 500 VFUs at a New Jersey cultivation facility. These installations are part of Agrify’s ‘total turn-key’ (TTK) solution for customers. On April 13, Agrify announced an international VFU installation agreement with BioCann Pharma in Portugal. This agreement will involve the installation of 190 VFUs at a grow facility on the Portuguese island of Madeira. And finally, on April 20, Agrify announced the release of its VFU rapid deployment pack, a system of prepackaged vertical farm units (10, 15, 20, or 28) designed for faster installation to accelerate the cultivation process. And this is all just in one month. Among the bulls is Roth Capital analyst Scott Fortune, who sees the TTK as the key to Agrify’s future success. He writes: “Our long-term thesis on AGFY remains intact and view 2022 as a year of execution for management to setup the pivotal 2023 inflection to high margin SaaS revenue. Converting the potential sales pipeline into TTK deals remains the primary driver for the company. We view the market demand for TTK’s as favorable with NJ coming online 2Q22, CT and NY potentially 4Q22, and additional licenses approved in IL and MA. We expect growing demand for cannabis derivative products to drive additional extraction growth, generating revenues from extraction solutions of $62M-$65M in ‘22."" In line with this upbeat view, Fortune rates AGFY a Buy, and his $15 price target indicates his belief in ~311% one-year upside for the stock. (To watch Fortune’s track record, click here) There is plenty of optimism for Agrify on Wall Street, as shown by the Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock has 4 recent analyst reviews, including 3 Buys and 1 Hold. The shares have a current trading price of $3.66, and their $11.75 average target implies ~222% upside from that level.

4/21/2022,"Netflix's ""The Stock Crash"" is now airing on the Yahoo Finance ticker pages, and according to the company's Co-CEO Reed Hastings the market's reaction to the company's latest disappointing quarter is well-deserved and reflects several issues that will take time to correct. ""We're working on how to monetize sharing. We've been thinking about that for a couple of years, but when we were growing fast, it wasn't the high priority to work on. And now we're working super hard on it. And remember these are over 100 million households that already are choosing to view Netflix. They love the service, we just got to get paid,"" Hastings told investors on the earnings call. ""And then two, it's really, we got great competition. They've got some very good shows and films out. And what we got to do is take it up a notch. And I'll tell you that we're all pretty ... I know it's disappointing for investors and it is for sure. But internally, we're really geared up and this is like our moment to shine. This is when it all matters. And we're super focused on achieving those objectives and getting back into our investors' good graces."" Shares of the streaming media giant plunged 26% in pre-market on Wednesday as Wall Street analysts marked down their estimates and price targets after the shocking quarterly miss on sales and net subscribers that reflect the challenges outlined by Hastings. Here's how Netflix performed compared to Wall Street analyst estimates: Revenue: $7.87 billion vs. $7.95 billion expected, $7.16 billion Y/Y Earnings per share: $3.53 vs. $2.91 expected, $3.75 Y/Y Net subscribers: -200,000 vs. +2.51 million expected, +3.98 million million Y/Y For the current quarter, Netflix said it expected an even steeper decline in new users as it battles through increased competition from the likes of Apple and Paramount and tries to get 100 million account sharers to pay up. The streaming service is modeling for subscribers to decline by 2 million in the fiscal second quarter, whereas consensus analysts were looking for a gain of 2.4 million. ""However, given that 2Q is likely to be another challenging quarter for subscriber growth and, given that account-sharing monetization and the advertising-supported product are 2023-2024 events, we don't expect investors to collectively allocate more capital to owning Netflix in 2022. We believe investors will want to be closer in time to the implementation of these changes and might want to see some confirmation that they're having the desired effect before rerating the stock higher. 2Q is generally a softer seasonal quarter, but the content slate has popular returning series, including 'Ozark' (Season 4, finale), 'Stranger Things,' and 'Grace & Frankie.' The upcoming slate builds in the back half of 2022, leading up to a bigger 4Q with titles such as 'Gray Man' and 'Knives Out 2,'"" said Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft.

Musk's latest compensation windfall, which must be certified by Tesla's board, comes days after he offered to buy Twitter Inc for $43 billion, with analysts suggesting he could sell Tesla shares to help finance the deal. Musk already is the world's richest person, according to Forbes. Tesla reported quarterly revenue of $18.76 billion and so-called adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $5.02 billion. Combined with the previous three quarters' results, that surpasses milestones that trigger the vesting of the ninth through 11th of 12 tranches of options granted to Musk in his 2018 pay package. Musk said Wednesday there were no discussions underway about incremental compensation. Musk, who is also a major shareholder and CEO of rocket maker SpaceX, receives no salary at Tesla. His pay package requires Tesla's market capitalization and financial growth to hit a series of escalating targets. Each tranche gives Musk the option to buy 8.4 million Tesla shares at $70.01 each, a discount of about 90% from Wednesday's closing price of $977.20. At the stock's current price, the three options tranches that will vest as a result of Tesla's March-quarter performance could generate a profit of about $23 billion, or almost $7.7 billion per tranche. Late last year, Musk netted $16.4 billion from selling about 10% of his stake in Tesla to meet to meet tax withholding obligations related to the exercise of stock options.

4/21/2022,"Popular innovation investor Cathie Wood of ARK Invest has seen her funds sink at a rapid pace over the past few quarters. Her flagship ARK Innovation Fund (ARKK) has already lost over two-thirds of its value from peak to trough, thanks to a more hawkish Federal Reserve. As the Fed proceeds with its rate-hike schedule and the possibility of a double-point hike in May, rates on the 10-year note yield could easily continue to surge, adding even more selling pressure to ARKK and the high-multiple growth trade. Despite the magnitude of the headwinds and the damage that's already been done to the ARK line of funds, Wood has not changed her stance on investing in innovation, insisting that investors think long term. It is respectable that Wood has doubled down on some of the fallen darlings within the ARK basket. Eventually, such beaten-down names will bounce back with a vengeance. Against this backdrop, we've used TipRanks’ Stock Comparison tool to evaluate three of the largest stocks within the ARK Innovation Fund. Let's dig deeper and see which stock has more room to run. Teladoc (TDOC) Teladoc has been a disaster for investors over the past year, shedding 64% of its value from peak to trough. Undoubtedly, the telehealth innovator was a major beneficiary of pandemic lockdowns. Amid the strength, investors got a bit overexcited, and eventually, the stock crumbled. At writing, the stock trades at $64 and change per share. It's lost all of its pandemic gains and then some. As one of the most beaten-down stocks in the ARK Innovation basket, bottom-fishers have a lot of reason to be intrigued. At just five times sales, Teladoc is hardly an expensive stock anymore. The growth is still alive, with a guide of 25%-30% revenue growth for 2022. Teladoc CEO Jason Gorevic also remains incredibly bullish, previously noting of major tailwinds ahead, including the expansion of support from regulators. It's not a mystery that TDOC remains one of Cathie Wood's most cherished plays. Wall Street analysts are also incredibly bullish on the name, with the average Teladoc price target of $99.17, suggesting ~53% upside from current levels. Zoom Video Communications (ZM) Next up, we have Zoom Video Communications, a video-conferencing kingpin that's also suffered a massive reversal of fortune in the past year, sinking 72% from peak to trough. Indeed, an overwhelming majority of the pandemic gains have been wiped out. With a mere eight times sales multiple and more favorable comparables ahead, the risk/reward has arguably never been this good in the pandemic era. Remote and hybrid work is likely here to stay, even if the pandemic were to shift into endemic mode at some point. This alone should drive demand for digital communications. It's not just the firm's flagship video service that could drive growth in the road ahead, though. For the latest quarter, the company clocked in an impressive 21% in revenue growth, with prominent strength in Zoom Phone and Zoom Rooms. The recently launched Zoom Contact Center may also bode well for growth moving forward. With the recent strength across a broader range of offerings and a potential opportunity to create immersive metaverse-like experiences similar to Microsoft's Teams Mesh, there are many levers the firm can pull to keep its impressive growth alive. Wood still views Zoom as an innovator, not merely a pandemic one-hit-wonder. I think she's right on the money. Wall Street analysts share Wood's bullish view, with an average ZM stock price target of $162.56, suggesting ~46% upside from today's levels. Tesla (TSLA) Tesla stock has held its own amid the tech-focused plunge, falling less than 40% from peak to trough. Today, shares of Tesla are down just 16%, far less damage than that endured by your average ARKK stock. EVs remain one of the most exciting places to be in innovation these days. Though the EV pioneer has kept its stock supported by incredible quarterly results, it's worth noting that an increase in competition could threaten Tesla's spot at the top of the podium at some point in the future. There's no denying the innovation going on at Tesla. Wood and many other Tesla bulls and Elon Musk fans may claim the rich, high-tech multiple on shares of TSLA is more than warranted, given the company's unparalleled innovative capabilities. Could it really be that Tesla is miles ahead of rivals, with a frontrunner position in autonomous driving? It's hard to tell at this juncture. In time, rivals could close the gap on the battery tech front, leaving just the brand and autonomous hopes powering the stock's pie-in-the-sky multiple. In any case, the stakes are extraordinarily high for the relatively resilient top holding in ARKK, which currently trades at 18.9 times sales. For now, Tesla appears to be firing on all cylinders, with auto sales and margins continuing to power higher. Adjusted net profits for the fourth quarter came in at an impressive $2.88 billion, up from just $903 million posted a quarter prior. Arguably, such impressive growth deserves a rich premium multiple, even as investors sour on the growth trade. (See TSLA stock forecast on TipRanks) Conclusion While investors can get a good dose of innovation from the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, which holds more profitable tech companies versus the ARK Innovation Fund, Wood argues that such indices aren't giving investors exposure to ""true innovation."" The top three holdings within ARKK could provide more bounce once this tech sell-off finally ends. Between Tesla, Teladoc, and Zoom, analysts seem most bullish on Teladoc over the next 12 months.

4/21/2022,"Netflix (NFLX) is past its prime. Shares of the streaming media giant crashed nearly 40% on Wednesday as the company uncorked another disappointing quarter, sparking fresh worry on the Street about future growth potential. ""I think its best days are behind it,"" said Macquarie tech analyst Tim Nollen on Yahoo Finance Live. Nollen is one of the few analysts on Wall Street to downgrade Netflix shares ahead of the company's latest results. And Nollen's call looks to be spot on. Here's how Netflix performed compared to Wall Street analyst estimates: Revenue: $7.87 billion vs. $7.95 billion expected, $7.16 billion Y/Y Earnings per share: $3.53 vs. $2.91 expected, $3.75 Y/Y Net subscribers: -200,000 vs. +2.51 million expected, +3.98 million million Y/Y For the current quarter, Netflix said it expected an even steeper decline in new users as it battles through increased competition from the likes of Apple and Paramount and tries to get 100 million account sharers to pay up. The streaming service is modeling for subscribers to decline by 2 million in the fiscal second quarter, whereas consensus analysts were looking for a gain of 2.4 million. Nollen is standing by his Sell rating on Netflix even in the wake of the stock's plunge. ""We certainly are avoiding the stock and selling the stock for now,"" Nollen said. ""Eventually, if they can turn this around there is still a good growth opportunity for them — particularly internationally."" Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

4/21/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Hedge fund Kerrisdale Capital Management is betting against the shell company tied to Donald Trump, wagering that it will fail to get regulatory approval to merge with his media company and take it public. Most Read from Bloomberg Kremlin Insiders Alarmed Over Growing Toll of Putin’s War in Ukraine Netflix Rout Is Worst Since 2004, Punishing Roku and Disney, Too Ukrainian Troops Risk Being Encircled in New Russian Offensive Ukraine Update: Mariupol on Brink; China Stands With Moscow Billionaire’s Abrupt Death Leaves Dubai to Untangle Messy Inheritance Shares of Digital World Acquisition Corp., a special-purpose acquisition company, have more room to fall, according to a report Wednesday from Kerrisdale announcing its short position. DWAC gave misleading statements in registration documents and the high-profile nature of its potential combination with the former president’s company, Trump Media & Technology Group, is an “ideal way” for regulators to send a message to the broader industry, it said. “DWAC is not just another dubious 2021 SPAC; it is a poster child for some of the worst abuses the investment vehicle has spawned,” according to the report from Kerrisdale, which is led by founder and chief investment officer Sahm Adrangi. SPACs have faced increased scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after they exploded in popularity as a way for companies to go public without some of the rules required for initial public offerings. The crackdown could be the biggest obstacle to the Trump’s bid to create a media company to rival Twitter Inc., which banished him. Shares of DWAC soared in October when the blank-check company announced it would merge with Trump’s media group, fueling a retail trader frenzy. The SPAC has since pared its advance after downloads of Truth Social, Trump’s social-media app, dried up and key technology executives departed. “Truth Social’s disaster of a launch, among many other red flags regarding TMTG, raise valid concerns over execution and the company’s long-term viability,” Kerrisdale said in the report. “These factors raise serious doubts regarding the scope of due diligence DWAC conducted.” DWAC will likely never file an S-4 with documentation of that due diligence, which will doom the merger, according to the report. That would wipe out 80% of its current share price of $45.61 and bring it back down to the $10 level where most SPACs raise capital.

4/21/2022,"Reuters reported that demand for Paxlovid lagged estimates.  Pfizer’s coronavirus drug was expected to boost the company’s financial performance.  Earnings estimates have started to move lower, which is bearish for Pfizer shares.  Shares of Pfizer gained downside momentum after a Reuters report indicated that demand for the company’s antiviral drug Paxlovid was lower than previously expected. The report noted that factors like reduced testing and the spread of Omicron, which is believed to be less severe than Delta, contributed to the decline in demand for Paxlovid. Previously, markets thought that Paxlovid would be a material contributor to Pfizer’s bottom line. However, it looks that analysts will have to adjust their forecasts after the new report. Not surprisingly, Pfizer shares found themselves under pressure after the Reuters report was released. Analysts expect that Pfizer will report earnings of $7.23 per share in the current year and earnings of $5.69 per share in the next year, so the stock is trading at 9 forward P/E. It should be noted that analyst estimates have started to move lower in recent weeks as analysts began to adjust their demand forcasts for coronavirus vaccines and treatments. While Pfizer stock looks cheap at current valuation levels, it remains to be seen whether speculative traders will rush to buy the stock in the current situation. Earnings are expected to decline, and earnings estimates may move even lower in case sales of Paxlovid are weak as the Reuters report suggests. If analyst estimates continue to move lower in the upcoming weeks, Pfizer stock could find itself under more pressure and move closer to yearly lows near the $45.50 level.

4/21/2022,"Investors should lean toward owning stable stocks amid the increasingly volatile economic backdrop and hope for the best, fancies Goldman Sachs. Goldman strategist Ben Snider said in a new note Tuesday that stable stocks — or ones that sport low share price and earnings growth volatility — are a must-own in this current moment. The strategist said the investment bank's basket of stable growth stocks has outperformed the S&P 500 by five percentage points during the past six months as economic risks such as rising inflation have risen. These types of stocks ""appear to have room to run,"" said Snider. The valuations on these stable stocks look attractive, too. Snider added, ""Stable stocks also trade with undemanding valuations, supporting the likelihood that they will outperform if the macro environment grows increasingly challenging. Stocks with stable share prices and stable earnings growth generally trade with a valuation premium relative to more volatile peers and to the typical S&P 500 stock. However, relative valuations today are much lower than they have generally been during the last few years."" Snider's call comes against a backdrop of slowing economic growth, stubbornly high inflation and elevated geopolitical risk. That cocktail has Wall Street increasingly worried about a recession within the next two years. ""Our analysis of historical G10 episodes suggests that although strong economic momentum limits the risk in the near-term, the policy tightening we expect raises the odds of recession. As a result, we now see the odds of a recession as roughly 15% in the next 12 months and 35% within the next 24 months,"" said Jan Hatzius, Snider's colleague at Goldman, on Monday. Earlier this month, Deutsche Bank's Matthew Luzzetti became the first economist from a major Wall Street firm to predict a U.S. recession. Others such as Goldman have since piled on. The latest economic data sheds light on the recession calls. Inflation readings continue to run red-hot as the economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic and deals with soaring prices for energy. The Producer Price Index (PPI) for March recently showed a worrying 11.2% advance spanning the past 12 months. Goldman's economists led by Hatzius expect annual average U.S. real GDP growth to slow from 6% in 2021 to 3% in 2022. The team sees 2% growth for 2023.

4/21/2022,"(Reuters) - CalPERS, the largest U.S. public pension fund, on Tuesday said it will vote for a shareholder proposal that Berkshire Hathaway Inc replace Warren Buffett as chairman, though he would remain chief executive officer. The fund, whose full name is the California Public Employees' Retirement System, disclosed its vote in a regulatory filing ahead of Berkshire's scheduled April 30 annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. CalPERS said it invests more than $450 billion, including more than $2.3 billion in Berkshire shares. Berkshire did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In proposing to install an independent chair at Berkshire, the nonprofit National Legal and Policy Center said the roles of CEO and chairman are ""greatly diminished"" when one person holds both. Berkshire opposes the proposal. It has said someone outside management should be chairman after Buffett is no longer in charge, but that the billionaire should remain chairman and CEO. Buffett, 91, has run Berkshire since 1965. Berkshire plans for Buffett's son Howard Buffett to become non-executive chairman after his father's departure, while Vice Chairman Greg Abel is slated to become CEO. Shareholder proposals that Berkshire opposes are generally defeated by large or overwhelming margins. Buffett recently controlled about 32% of Berkshire's voting power, while owning about 16% of its stock. CalPERS said it will also vote for shareholder proposals that Berkshire report on its plans to reduce greenhouse gases and improve diversity, and its own proposal that Berkshire report on its plan to handle climate risk. Berkshire opposes these proposals. CalPERS also plans to withhold votes to reelect directors Susan Decker and Meryl Witmer because of a lack of disclosures related to climate change. The fund backed U.S. company directors 72% of the time in 2021, according to the research firm Insightia.

4/21/2022,"Steel prices have moved higher all over the world.  In the U.S., the infrastructure plan should provide additional demand for steel.  Steel stocks gained a lot of ground in 2022, but they continue to trade at reasonable valuation levels.  Steel stocks had a strong start of this year as problems with steel production in Ukraine and sanctions on Russia have created a tight market in the world. In addition, U.S. President Joe Biden has recently said that U.S. – made steel will be mandated for projects made under the infrastructure plan. In this environment, steel stocks will remain on investors’ radars. Cleveland-Cliffs stock is up by more than 40% year-to-date, but the company’s shares still trade at a modest 8 forward P/E. At this point, analysts do not believe that current pricing conditions will remain in 2023, so the analyst consensus predicts that the company’s earnings will decline from $5.89 in 2022 to $3.79 in 2023. However, analyst estimates are rising fast, so Cleveland-Cliffs stock may have more upside without multiple expansion. Nucor stock has also benefited from favorable market conditions and gained about 50% since the beginning of this year. Nucor has historically enjoyed a premium over its peers in the steel industry, and it is currently trading at almost 19 forward P/E. It should be noted that analysts believe that Nucor 2023 earnings will decline by more than 50% compared to the projected 2022 earnings, and it remains to be seen whether such forecasts are accurate. In the U.S. Steel case, analysts expect that the company’s earnings will decline from $10.8 in 2022 to $3.93 in 2023, so the stock is trading at 9 forward P/E. Analyst estimates for the year 2023 have been moving higher in recent weeks, and the continuation of this trend should provide additional support to U.S. Steel stock.

4/21/2022,"For a company with a market cap around the quarter of a trillion mark, Alibaba (BABA) stock’s one-year performance resembles that of a small-cap. Over the past 12 months, the shares have lost 60% of their value as a confluence of bearish developments have kept pushing the share price lower. According to Deutsche Bank analyst Leo Chiang, given the latest domestic Omicron outbreak and international geopolitical uncertainties, investors should expect “more near-term pressures for BABA across its various business lines.” The analyst says the “escalating lockdown measures” and international developments have hit the company hard on several fronts. “1) ecommerce, due to logistical disruption; 2) other retail and local services, on muted offline activities; and 3) Cloud, because of on-site project delays,” Chiang explained. “On international, the recent geopolitical tensions have further dragged on the growth trajectory amid the ongoing impact of the EU’s removal of the VAT exemption and the currency depreciation in certain markets (e.g., Turkey).” As for the June Quarter, assuming a gradual recovery which began in May, Chiang anticipates it will probably be the “toughest quarter for domestic businesses (e.g., ecommerce, other retail, local services, Cloud).” However, in light of the ongoing geopolitical uncertainties, over the next few quarters, international commerce “may continue to fluctuate.” On the margin front, to counter China Commerce’s soft performance, Chiang thinks the company will resort to “prudent” investments in new initiatives, Taobao Deal and Taocaicai. That said, there are some positives to note. During the lockdown period, the FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) and on-demand local services such as Hema and ele.me increased the new user count and “deepened user engagement,” particularly in major hubs like Shanghai and Shenzhen. Going forward, Chiang sees “structural opportunities post pandemic” for these businesses. All in all, Chiang wraps up on a hopeful note: “Despite the near-term challenges, we remain confident in the ample potential and solid fundamentals of its new businesses, such as Cloud and international commerce, to support long-term growth.” To this end, the Deutsche Bank analyst rates BABA a Buy along with a $172 price target. This target brings the upside potential to an 84%. (To watch Chiang’s track record, click here) Overall, Wall Street takes a bullish stance on Alibaba shares. 16 Buys and 1 Sell issued over the previous three months make the stock a Strong Buy. Meanwhile, the $171.36 average price target suggests ~83% upside from current levels.

4/21/2022,"By Sabrina Valle HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. estimates there will be a $4 trillion market by 2050 for capturing carbon dioxide and storing it underground, the company said in a presentation on Tuesday. That is about 60% of the $6.5 trillion market the U.S. largest crude producer estimates for oil and gas by then. Carbon capture is an important emissions reduction technology, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). It involves the capture of CO2 from fuel combustion or industrial processes, transporting it via ship or pipeline, to be stored underground in geological formations or used as a resource to create products. Large oil companies have been investing to make carbon capture and storage (CCS) a relevant business as international bodies such as Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) point the technology as key to mitigate the effects of global warming. Exxon is under public pressure to reduce its total emissions as its energy transition strategy does not include renewable sources of energy like solar and wind. It has recently hired Dan Ammann, who led the Cruise self-driving unit of General Motors Co until December, to lead its Low Carbon business starting on May 1. U.S. oil producer Occidental Petroleum, developing the world's largest project to extract CO2 from the air, has previously estimated CCS could become a $3-5 trillion global industry. The technology could generate as much in earnings and cash flow for Occidental than oil and gas today, Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said at a conference in March.

4/21/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors are shifting more of their shares in Chinese e-commerce giants to the Hong Kong market, as Beijing’s efforts have yet to dispel concerns over the companies’ eligibility to remain listed on Wall Street. Most Read from Bloomberg Kremlin Insiders Alarmed Over Growing Toll of Putin’s War in Ukraine Netflix Rout Is Worst Since 2004, Punishing Roku and Disney, Too Ukrainian Troops Risk Being Encircled in New Russian Offensive Ukraine Update: Mariupol on Brink; China Stands With Moscow Ackman Loses More Than $430 Million on 3-Month Netflix Bet About 77% of JD.com Inc.’s shares are circulating in Hong Kong’s clearing and settling system as of Tuesday, versus 44% at the beginning of this year, according to Bloomberg calculations based on stock exchange data. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s Hong Kong-listed share portion rose to 56% from 53% during the same period, the data show. Most of this year’s conversions at Alibaba and JD.com took place this month, even as China modified a decade-old rule that potentially removed a key hurdle for U.S. regulators to gain full access to auditing reports. While other companies that are listed in both Hong Kong and New York haven’t seen a similar scale of share conversion this year, the moves by shareholders at Alibaba and JD.com highlight that the U.S. delisting risk remains a concern. By slashing exposure to American depositary shares, investors avoid direct regulatory shocks that may force trading suspensions and liquidation of their stock in the U.S. “We are buying incrementally through the Hong Kong shares instead of U.S. shares,” said Louis Lau, fund manager at Brandes Investment Partners, who said Beijing’s efforts lowered the possibility of delisting, but the odds still stand at 50%. “The attention is now shifting onto implementation -- how will China grant U.S. audit access and to what companies.” The U.S. and China have been at odds for two decades over the mandate that all companies that trade publicly in America grant access to audit work papers. Firms face removal if they shirk requirements for three straight years, meaning they could be kicked off the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq as soon as 2024. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has named at least 23 Chinese companies on a list of those who are running afoul of the auditing requirements. There are more than 200 Chinese firms that are listed in the U.S., of which about 20 companies also have a listing status in Hong Kong, and that group is expected to increase. Holders of depositary receipts can hand their U.S. shares back to the depositary bank to register a conversion, which then swaps them into Hong Kong-listed shares at a set ratio. The portion of Hong Kong-listed shares at JD.com and Alibaba almost doubled last year. To be sure, a conversion doesn’t offset all of the risks introduced by U.S. delisting. Investors will need to deal with a less liquid market and potentially lower valuation when shares are shifted back to Hong Kong. “There are more discussions in the market on the differences in liquidity and investor structures between the Hong Kong and U.S. stock markets,” said Jamie Chen, an analyst at Third Bridge Group Ltd. “It is inevitable that there will be some discounts in valuations and the turnover rate will also be reduced. This is the main risk of listing in Hong Kong.” The Hang Seng Tech Index has dropped 27% in Hong Kong this year, and the risk of abandoned U.S. listings remains a key overhang for the sector. Didi Global Inc. tumbled Monday after the Chinese ride-hailing giant said it’s planning to delist its U.S.-traded shares before it finds a new venue for the stock. On Wednesday, Didi shares fell 6.9%, Alibaba Group Holding dropped 4.3%, and JD.com slumped 5.5%. Baidu slid 3.4%. Tech Chart of the Day Netflix shares fell as much as 39% on Wednesday, their biggest intraday percentage loss since 2004. The selloff, spurred by weak subscriber trends, took the stock to its lowest since 2018. With the drop, Netflix is now down more than 60% for 2022, making it the worst-performing component of both the Nasdaq 100 Index and the S&P 500 Index.

4/21/2022,"By Sam Boughedda Investing.com – Stocks ended the day mixed on Wednesday as a 35% plunge in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares weighed on tech stocks but strong earnings from other companies lifted the Dow.
