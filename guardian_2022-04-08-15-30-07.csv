4/8/2022,"More than $1.5bn (£1.2bn) worth of personal property including cars, olive groves, shops, houses, electronics and jewellery has been seized by the Syrian government from citizens accused of joining anti-government protests, according to a rights group. The Association of Detainees and the Missing in Sednaya Prison (ADMSP) estimates that almost 40% of those detained after the Syrian uprising of 2011 were subject to property seizures.It alleges the Syrian regime has attempted to circumvent international sanctions through this revenue, while ensuring that former detainees in exile have nothing to return to as the country struggles to rebuild.“The regime did this, they took everything so that we don’t go back,” said Hassan Al Haj, remembering his family’s land in a village near Aleppo. “We used to have lands with olive and pistachio trees. I’d built a house there but never moved in. The government seized it before I was able to.” Al Haj and other former detainees interviewed by the Guardian said they were forced to sign convictions against them while blindfolded, after being tried on terrorism charges for taking part in protests. This meant neither they nor their families were aware they were forced to sign away both their civil rights and anything they owned. “My family initially didn’t know there was a ruling to seize our property,” he said. “What they knew is I was sentenced to 15 years in prison.”“After my release, when we asked those in our village, we learned that people associated with the intelligence services are using our land, to plant trees and sell the wood. They tell people in the village that this land, these properties belong to terrorists so that no one dares approach or ask any questions.” ADMSP describes how the dictatorial regime of Bashar al-Assad honed legal methods to confiscate property from detainees as part of a brutal crackdown on protests following the Syrian uprising of 2011.Those accused of joining demonstrations or carrying out anti-government activity were convicted under an anti-terrorism law that permits the state to permanently strip them of all civil rights and opt to seize any property or belongings. “It’s akin to a revenge or scare tactic that the regime is using,” said Diab Serrih of ADMSP, who pointed out that the seizures have reshaped Syria, as most of the property claimed by the state is in areas previously associated with dissent, such as Daraya in the south, and Homs and Aleppo in the north. Tarek Ibrahim, whose name has been changed for his safety, described how the government seized 15,000 sq metres of his family’s land near Damascus. “I had many beautiful memories of that place,” he said. The state also seized properties and a computer equipment shop previously operated by his family. Ibrahim was arrested along with two of his brothers in 2012 for being anti-government media workers in Aleppo. His family later learned that both his brothers were executed in Sednaya military prison, outside Damascus. It was only after Ibrahim’s release from prison in 2020 that he learned he had been stripped of all civil rights, including the right to own property or possessions. The rulings against all three brothers meant the entire family’s property had been confiscated, including their parents’ land. “All of our family properties are now held by the state. We can’t do anything with them – if we try to sell them or rent them, the government will seize them and arrest anyone involved,” he said. Ibrahim said he decided to leave Syria after being detained and then ejected from a government building for attempting to obtain a passport for his young daughter. State bureaucrats saw that his paperwork bore a stamp showing he had been stripped of all civil rights. They warned him: “If you come back, we will have you arrested.”",News/Global development,Syria’s $1.5bn seizure of protesters’ property ‘akin to scare tactic’,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/08/syria-billion-dollar-seizure-of-protesters-property-akin-to-scare-tactic
4/8/2022,"Greenfinch populations, which were previously in steep decline in the UK, are showing the first signs of recovery, according to the latest annual RSPB big garden birdwatch results. The citizen science survey gives a good idea of how bird populations are faring in Britain. This year almost 700,000 people took part, counting more than 11 million birds. Many scientists and bird enthusiasts have been worried about the greenfinch, which has experienced a population crash of 63% since 1993 after a severe outbreak of trichomonosis. The little finch was put on the red list last year, signalling it was at risk. This year, however, there has been a small increase in greenfinch sightings, raising hopes for the recovery of the species. The deadly infection is spread through contaminated food and drinking water, or by birds feeding one another with regurgitated food during the breeding season. Garden owners can help slow transmission rates by temporarily stopping the provision of food if ill birds are seen and making sure that garden bird feeders are cleaned regularly. Another bird that fared well was the jay, a colourful acorn-eating corvid with bright blue and peach plumage. It moved up nine places in the RSPB’s rankings of most seen birds to number 23, an increase of 73% compared with 2021 numbers. The RSPB’s chief executive, Beccy Speight, said: “We don’t know the reasons for the sudden increase in jay sightings this year. It may be down to food availability as we have reports that last year was poor for acorns. Whatever the reason, a sighting of this stunning bird is enough to raise one’s spirits any day of the year, let alone on a gloomy January weekend. “It’s been brilliant to see so many people taking part again this year, taking time out to watch and reconnect with birds and then generously submit their sightings to help RSPB scientists gain some insight into how our garden birds are faring.” The top three birds from last year held their positions: the house sparrow remained at the top of rankings as the most commonly seen garden bird, with more than 1.7 million recorded sightings throughout the weekend. Blue tit and starling remained in the number two and three positions respectively. The bird that fared worst compared with last year was the long-tailed tit, which was seen 23.6% less than in 2021. The fuzzy little bird, which weaves its nest from cobwebs and lichen, suffers during cold snaps and is prone to unsuccessful breeding years. 1. House sparrow2. Blue tit3. Starling4. Wood pigeon5.

4/8/2022,"In an era of undercover investigations, hidden videos and potential prison sentences for those involved in trespassing, US livestock farmers are not known for welcoming activists on to their land, or letting them find homes for unwanted calves.But Vermont-based activist Jason Bolalek has upended a narrative of opposing sides by befriending dairy producers in his home state, the biggest dairy-producing state in north-east US. Vermont in the snow makes an enchanting picture, but conditions inside dairy farms can be far from picturesque. The calves Bolalek rehomes are mostly males, as they are of little use in a business reliant on female cows to breed and produce milk. Many are shot at birth because it is cheaper and easier than waiting for them to gain weight then driving them to market to be sold at auction.“It’s not worth it. Sometimes, you make three bucks on a calf that cost you six dollars in gas to transport,” one dairy farmer told Bolalek. It is impossible to know how many dairy calves are shot in the US each year, since there’s no official record of animals that don’t enter the food chain. But an agricultural veterinarian who prefers to remain anonymous says numbers could be in the hundreds of thousands. Using sexed semen to produce only female calves is another option but according to another agricultural vet, who also prefers to remain anonymous, many farmers see shooting males as cheaper. A cow has her legs tethered to prevent ‘splitting’ – when a cow slips on the wet concrete floor and can sometimes not get up because her legs have split in opposite directions In the UK, which is home to about 2.7 million dairy cattle, an estimated 95,000 calves were killed each year, although that number is believed to have fallen significantly through the increased use of sexed semen. By that ratio, the number of calves killed annually in the US, home to more than 9 million dairy cows, could be close to 300,000. Only a fraction of those can be saved, and Bolalek remains frustrated that the public knows so little about standard dairy practices such as shooting calves, or wintering cows in barns on chains so short they can only stand or lie for weeks on end. Barns dot the Vermont landscape, adding to its bucolic feel, but hundreds of cows live in this barn, with little outdoor access in winter. Born in the New York state town of Rochester, Bolalek’s world was urban until a move to Vermont brought him face to face with dairy production. “I had no idea about farming. When I went to Vermont to grow hemp, I was exposed to the dairy industry – it’s chock full of dairy farms,” he says. “I looked like a tourist because I was always stopping to see the cows. Then I heard a story about how the farmers killed the males, and that changed my life.” Bolalek asked the friend who had told him about the practice of shooting males to introduce him to one of the farmers. “My first plan was to save just two calves. And it was so easy – every door opened.” Jason Bolalek, and (top) a newborn calf which could face slaughter. Once introduced, discussions began of how and when he might take two calves. Critical to the talks, Bolalek says, was both sides seeing each other as people. “I had to learn how to be opposed to dairy but friends with the farmers – and all farmers are different.” He says he did not have to deal with any overt activist versus farmer issues, possibly because Vermont has not yet been a target for undercover animal welfare actions. The other advantage, Bolalek says, is that he is not trying to convince the farmers of anything. “I just want to leave with the calf, and they have too many male calves. That makes it quite simple.” Bolalek believes that what matters is the stories the sanctuaries tell of each animal. “That is what helps educate people about dairy. That’s the bridge over the gap between the people buying dairy products with no understanding of how it is produced – which included me. I was clueless about dairy production.” Bolalek befriends, feeds and rescues a calf in Vermont. After he collected the first two calves, Bolalek founded a rescue organisation, Destination Liberation, funded by social media donations, and has since found homes for 75 unwanted calves. He recently became a manager at Rosie’s Farm Sanctuary in Maryland. It is his dream job, he says, and means he will be rescuing and keeping calves, rather than trying to find homes for them. Cows are meant to be on grass, insists Bolalek. “The only limit is space; cows are all about space. That is why dairy farming is so unnatural – they are very confined. Some never leave their barns. They spend their whole lives on concrete floors and it does terrible things to their bodies. Cows are meant to be on grass.”Bolalek says the animals he rescues are always given, never sold, to their new homes, and one of the fundamental rules of the sanctuary community is that animals must have proper space, food, shelter, love and veterinary care for the rest of their natural lives.

4/8/2022,"The confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the US supreme court marked a moment in American history many in public life waited over decades for – and one some thought they would never see happen. When the day arrived, it inspired an outbreak of euphoria for many Black Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill. “I’m glad I’m alive,” said a joyful Yvette Clarke, a New York congresswoman. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) filed on to Capitol Hill, through corridors lined with portraits, busts and statues of the white men who have dominated Congress since its inception. Clarke’s district was once represented by the first Black woman ever elected to the Congress, the late Shirley Chisholm of Brooklyn, who was first elected in 1969. “I’m glad I’m around to witness this,” Clarke told the Guardian. “I wasn’t around for Thurgood Marshall,” she said, referring to the lawyer and civil rights activist who became the first African American on the supreme court in 1967, and who served until 1991. Clarke entered Congress in 2007. “This is so historic on so many different levels,” she said. After the 53-47 Senate vote that included the support of three Republicans, Jackson will take her place as an associate justice on the nine-member court. She will be the 121st justice to join America’s highest judicial body, established in 1790. In October 1967, Marshall became a supreme court justice. In September 1981, Sandra Day O’Connor became the first woman to serve on the court. In August 2009, Sonia Sotomayor became the court’s first Hispanic member. And in April 2022, Jackson became the first Black woman confirmed to the bench in its 232-year existence. “I’m very proud that my very first vote to confirm a supreme court nominee will be to confirm this historic pick,” Raphael Warnock, who won his own milestone race in January last year to become Georgia’s first Black US senator, told the Guardian as he headed to the Senate chamber to vote for Jackson. “I had the opportunity to meet her, and she brings talent and integrity and as we saw during those scorched-earth hearings, a great deal of grace and civility,” he added, nodding to Jackson’s confirmation sessions before the Senate judiciary committee last month where she endured vicious attacks from several Republicans. The chair of the CBC, Representative Joyce Beatty of Ohio, swept on to Capitol Hill on Thursday and witnessed Jackson’s triumph. “It means the world to us, because when you think about voting rights, when you think about our children, when you think about all of our fundamental issues – it starts at the supreme court,” Beatty said. “For the first time, a Black woman sitting there. It gives us balance. Not only because she’s Black, but because of her judicial temperance, and because of her reverence for the rule of law. But also when you look at her background and culture: she attended public [publicly funded] schools,” Beatty continued. Members of the caucus gathering in an ornate room in the Capitol near the House floor for a group photo after Jackson was confirmed included those holding black T-shirts saying “Black Women are Supreme”. Representative Hank Johnson of Georgia said: “Despite all of the dog-whistling and appealing to racist instincts among the Republican base, there are three Republican senators who have been able to work their way through all of the QAnon-conspiracy nonsense being spewed by Tom Cotton and Ted Cruz, and folks trying to outdo themselves with outrageousness directed toward [Jackson].” Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah broke with their fellows who went along with Republican leadership, and those who attacked Jackson outright, and voted for Joe Biden’s nominee. “I’m glad we had three Republican senators who saw through that, and recognized how eminently qualified Ketanji Brown Jackson is, and the fact that she will bring more experience to the bench than just about every one of the justices on the supreme court – including the chief justice [John Roberts],” Johnson added. Jackson has a connection to Congresswoman Frederica Wilson of Florida, who represents parts of Miami, and has known the judge’s parents for decades. “Her father was the first Black school board attorney when I was serving on the school board. Her mother was a principal when I was a principal … so [for] the Black people in Miami, you can imagine what’s happening now as we watch this,” she told the Guardian. “Young kids know her name, and they’re talking about her in schools. They’re talking about her in barbershops,” she said. “This was a young lady who grew up with people telling her you can be anything you want to be.” On Thursday afternoon, a beaming Kamala Harris also became emotional as, in her other role as president of the Senate, she announced that Jackson was officially confirmed. The first female and first Black US vice-president marked another historic moment that, as Harris said after she won the 2020 election with Biden, may be the first but “won’t be the last”.",News/US news,‘It means the world to us’: Black lawmakers’ euphoria greets Jackson confirmation,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/08/black-lawmakers-ketanji-brown-jackson-supreme-court

This time, they’re on a new platform after a tearful farewell to E! in 2021. But the tone is more or less the same, even if the title has been tweaked. Expect Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker’s engagement to feature prominently, along with the aftermath of the tragic events at Travis Scott’s Astroworld festival and, on a happier note, Kylie Jenner’s pregnancy.Disney+, from Thursday 14 April Catherine Tate returns to our screens with a documentary-style comedy, set in the fictional female prison of HMP Woldsley. Tate gets on the prosthetics to play multiple characters – from the incongruously happy-clappy governor Laura Willis to Big Viv, an inevitably furious lifer – as the inmates attempt to stage a musical with the idea of finding redemption via creativity. As is often the case with Tate, her undeniable talent and versatility as a performer is sometimes not quite enough to mask flaws in the writing, which can feel slightly one-note.Netflix, from Tuesday 12 April A second series for this meta-sitcom (very much in the stylistic vein of Curb Your Enthusiasm and Louie) starring Argentinian comic and radio personality Sebastián Wainraich as, inevitably, Sebastián, a slightly grouchy and put-upon comic and radio personality.

4/8/2022,"The sound system played Pink Floyd’s Money as the Patriotic Millionaires assembled in the boutique Eaton hotel in Washington DC last week. After compulsory Covid tests there was a lot of well-heeled hugging and laughter among a crowd that looked like extras from Succession as they sat down at tables stacked with M&Ms stamped with “tax the rich”. This was the first time since the pandemic that the Patriotic Millionaires had assembled together in person. The group, founded in 2010, is made up of high net worth individuals who believe – counterintuitively these days – that the really rich should pay more taxes. And after a dozen often frustrating years some of them now believe change is coming. In the White House, Joe Biden has proposed new taxes on households worth more than $100m. The war in Ukraine has shown that the international community can, and will, crack down on oligarchs. Some of the workers who made fortunes for Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Starbucks’s Howard Schultz have successfully formed unions despite the millions both companies spent fighting them off. “No one was talking about taxing the rich when we started,” said Morris Pearl, chair of the Patriotic Millionaires and a former managing director at BlackRock, the largest money manager in the world. Even the conversation seemed ridiculous under Donald Trump, Pearl added. “We have seen a huge change. You have a president talking about taxing the rich, people are talking about wealth taxes – those weren’t even fringe ideas 10 years ago. I’m not saying it’s going to happen and pass into law but there are conversations at the highest levels.” Part of the reason why those conversations are happening is that the situation has got so bad. Speaker after speaker at the one-day conference highlighted how the very, very rich have hijacked the political system around the world, run down wages and exacerbated income inequality, ramming home the title of the conference: Oligarchs vs All of Us: The Fight for Power & Money. Another member, Gary Stevenson, a British trader turned inequality economist, believes things are only going to get worse. Billionaires made fortunes from soaring stock markets, property prices and other assets during the pandemic. Government handouts have largely helped the rich, he argues. “If nothing is done this is going to be a massive disaster,” he said. “However bad you think things are, I guarantee they will get much, much worse.” When the pandemic struck there was talk of it being a great leveler – we were all in this together. In fact, Covid-19 exacerbated economic and racial inequalities. US billionaires received a $1.1tn windfall as their wealth soared to record levels. The billionaire class boomed in Asia and reached record levels in the UK. But as we emerge from the shadow of Covid-19, hoi poloi find themselves struggling with soaring inflation and rising cost of basics such as rent, utilities and food. For Stevenson this enormous explosion of wealth is “end of civilization stuff”. “There is one thing and one thing only that we can do,” he said. “We have got to take that money back.” But are rich – and overwhelmingly white – people the right people to push that message? Abigail Disney thinks so. Disney, the granddaughter of Roy Disney, co-founder of the Walt Disney Company, sees her family as a synechdoche for what has happened to the rest of America. The Disneys were already super-rich by the time Disney, 62, was born but their wealth grew enormously just as the gap between rich and poor has grown. “Money changed my family,” she said, and not for the better. Now, she says, those rich people live in another world and are unable to see what the consequences of rising inequality will be. Hearing that from one of their own breaks that barrier, she believes. “The only people billionaires will listen to are other billionaires and multimillionaires. You need at least the two commas. And if they won’t listen, there are their children and their wives, and they will listen,” she said. While her money opens the doors of power, Disney finds her message also discombobulates ordinary Americans. She is regularly assailed on Twitter for daring to suggest rich people should pay more taxes. The problem is that people have been convinced that “every single person in this country is a billionaire waiting to happen”, in an orchestrated campaign she believes was engineered to protect the wealth of the 1%. The last four decades have seen a massive redistribution of wealth. Only problem is it went to those who were already wealthy. https://t.co/anTolPYv5g Hearing one of the 1% suggest that maybe that dream is a nightmare makes people crazy, she said. “The pushback I get is: ‘You never worked a day in your life! You don’t know anything!’ Well, you are right, you are making my point for me! I should not have this power and influence. Just keep making my point for me,” she said. “For me to be speaking out against my own supposed self-interest has a wow factor that catches the attention. I don’t want to ever stop doing that. We need to model what it looks like to not defend your own self-interest all the time. When you are fine and other people are not, you put aside your own self-interest and stick up for somebody else.” The chance of Biden’s tax cuts making it through Congress are slim. US politicians rely too heavily on the wealthy and some Democrats as well as Republicans will balk at taxing them more. But Disney argues that the debate has changed. After the pandemic, US oligarchs aren’t the heroes they once were and, notably, Republicans have so far steered clear of an all-out attack on Biden’s proposal. “Four years ago if you’d said ‘billionaires tax’ then they would have said you can’t bash billionaires, you’re encouraging class warfare. I haven’t heard a whiff of that,” said Disney. “Let’s not kid ourselves, the other side has tested that and found it isn’t working. That class war rhetoric isn’t working any more. And that’s good news. Because if we don’t ruffle some feathers now, we are going to have a class war. A real one.”",News/US news,Tax the rich: these one percenters want people like them to pay higher taxes,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/08/patriotic-millionaires-one-percenters-pay-higher-taxes
4/8/2022,"When Ketanji Brown Jackson takes her place on the supreme court this summer, following her confirmation by the Senate on Thursday, it will bring to an end a painful period for US progressives, who were forced to watch Donald Trump appoint three rightwing justices under extremely contentious circumstances. But if left-leaning Americans think that the supreme court will be dramatically recalibrated by the appointment of KBJ – as she has become affectionately known, in an echo of RBG, the late justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg – they should think again. By replacing a fellow liberal, Stephen Breyer, she will effectively leave the current 6 to 3 conservative dominance of the court unchanged. That dominance has already been powerfully displayed in hyper-partisan rulings on voting and union rights, and is likely to be wielded again later this term when a divided court is expected to deliver a potentially fatal blow to the constitutional right to an abortion in Roe v Wade. Jackson will for now have to live with the fact that she and her two fellow liberal-leaning justices, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, will be lumbered with being in the frustrated minority at least for now. Which is not to say that Jackson’s presence as the new ninth member of the nation’s highest court will be immaterial. Far from it, she will bring to the bench a wealth of real-world knowledge and a personal narrative that no other justice can match. Top of the list of those qualities is her historic status as the first Black woman to sit on the court since its initial gathering in 1790. She will bring to deliberations the sensibility of someone whose parents grew up under Jim Crow segregation in Florida. “Her presence won’t do much to change the court’s ideological balance at this point, but her personal story as a Black woman and her diverse legal experience will have an impact,” said Noreen Farrell, a civil rights lawyer and executive director of Equal Rights Advocates. Farrell said that such an impact is likely to be especially apparent in criminal justice cases, given Jackson’s spell as a former federal public defender – making her the only justice in supreme court history to have represented defendants. “As someone who has represented indigent clients and people who have not always been treated fairly by the justice system, including people from communities of colour, she will give the court a new perspective.” Court watchers have already begun indulging in the parlour game of predicting where Jackson will fall along the ideological spectrum of the court’s members. That is a perilous sport, given that justices are appointed for life and, with no one telling them how to vote, are capable of surprises. Anthony Kennedy, who sat from 1988 to 2018, was nominated by Ronald Reagan but went on to side frequently with the liberal wing on social issues such as affirmative action, gay rights and abortion. When the analytical site FiveThirtyEight looked at where Jackson might end up, it came up with different answers according to what data model was applied. A model devised at Washington University in St Louis put her to the right of Sotomayor and Kagan, though still to the left of the most centrist conservatives, Brett Kavanaugh and chief justice John Roberts. A separate model created at Stanford, by contrast, predicted she would be the most left-leaning of all the nine justices. Examinations of her past opinions as a federal district court judge for eight years and an appeals court judge since last year similarly only tell you so much. She has certainly delighted progressives with some of her judgments, most memorably her 2019 ruling rejecting Trump’s attempt to block his former White House counsel Don McGahn having to testify before Congress. “Presidents are not kings,” she wrote. Yet in the same year she ruled in favor of Trump and the Department of Homeland Security and against environmental groups in allowing the expansion of the wall along the border with Mexico. Farrell believes that though Jackson will be in the minority, her meticulous style as a jurist, her long and precise opinions and legendary attention to detail will give her an outsized influence with colleagues, even the more conservative ones. “She never cuts corners, she holds herself and others to a higher standard, and that will have an influence on the language and scope of opinions.” Perhaps the greatest advantage she brings to the court is her age. At 51 she is the youngest of all the justices other than Amy Coney Barrett, a year her junior. That gives Jackson possibly three decades or more of service on the supreme court, over which timespan the fortunes of the liberal wing might improve. “She may not be able to change the outcome of cases immediately,” Farrell said, “but her long-term presence will be profound and we can see the soon-to-be justice Jackson taking a leadership role for years to come.”",News/US news,Ketanji Brown Jackson brings a personal narrative no other justice can match,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/08/ketanji-brown-jackson-impact-supreme-court
4/8/2022,"Atrip to the Cambridgeshire riverside village of Hemingford Grey, on the outskirts of St Ives, feels like wandering into a fairytale land of creeper-covered manor houses and thatched cottages with roses around the door. One of my favourite walks runs through the village, following paths through woods and flowering hay meadows and beside the Great Ouse. The river twists through the landscape, splitting and merging to form islands, or shining out suddenly from behind a churchyard wall. The loveliest thing about the church of Saint James is not its architecture (the now truncated spire was destroyed by a hurricane in 1741) so much as the views from its riverside churchyard. Left along the river is a particularly pretty view, through trees and reeds to a thatched cottage and boathouse. The churchyard gate, framed by tall Japanese anemones, leads to the yellow walls of the moss-roofed former Anchor pub, now just another picturesque cottage with thatch, half-timbering, and colour-washed bricks. Hemingford Grey once had nine pubs; only the Cock survives. I’m setting out from there on a warm day for a circular walk that will end with a pub lunch in the garden. A chillier walk could just as happily end by the fire in the bar. The village has numerous listed buildings, including the wisteria-hung Georgian River House, where the artist Walter Dendy Sadler once lived. Sadler is probably best known for Thursday (1880), which shows a group of monks fishing for their Friday feast, one of the three paintings that kicked off Henry Tate’s collection. Leaving Hemingford Grey, along a riverside path, I pass the gate of The Manor, setting for the Green Knowe children’s stories by Lucy Boston, who lived there. Its gardens are open daily (entrance a fiver). The village of Hemingford Abbots, less than a mile further on, is also stuffed with story-book cottages: there’s an old school house with a little clock tower, thatched animals on the rooftops and some Dutch-style gables that hint at the influence of the 17th-century engineers who arrived to help drain the fens. A heron is staring into the reeds on one side of the next meadow, a big, grassy island between two branches of the river. On the far side, paddleboarders are holding a race, with spectators lining the bridge above them. Also on that side, there is a National Trust cafe outside Houghton Mill, a working 18th-century watermill. From here, the route follows a short stretch of the Ouse Valley Way, which tracks the Great Ouse for 142 miles, from its source in Northamptonshire to where it meets the sea in Norfolk near King’s Lynn. This section runs through the Thicket path, where today butterflies – large whites and speckled woods – are dancing through the leaves. In spring, there are violets and primroses under the trees and the branches fill with birdsong. The route heads along a lime avenue back into the Old Riverport area of St Ives, past the recently renovated Norris Museum (free) with its Victorian fen skates and prehistoric pots. St Ives is the best place for car-free walkers to join the route (with a pub lunch after a couple of miles). The world’s longest guided busway stops in the town. The frequent buses, which look ordinary otherwise, have guide-wheels that emerge when they reach tracks: the driver doesn’t need to steer on those sections. I usually hop on the busway, which opened in 2011, at the relatively new Cambridge North railway station on the city’soutskirts and ride half an hour to St Ives, along a concrete track on the route of an old railway line. Once you leave the city, the landscape is flat fenland, with long views across south Cambridgeshire. There’s a sail-less windmill, a big church at Swavesey, and the lakes and reed beds of RSPB Fen Drayton nature reserve. In autumn and winter you’ll often see huge starling murmurations swirling against pink sunsets through the bus windows. In the middle of St Ives there’s a statue of Oliver Cromwell, who lived here in the 1630s. Today, I turn right just before the statue, heading back towards the Great Ouse. The river is crowded with ducks and swans and spanned by an arched medieval bridge with a chapel in the middle. Crossing the cobbled bridge, I head over the grassy expanses of Hemingford meadow towards the pub. In spring, the grass is still long beside the path and full of meadow flowers: cowslips, cuckoo flowers, and the pink spires of common spotted orchids. This is one of Cambridgeshire’s finest walks, and spring is really the best time to do it.

4/8/2022,"Four SAS witnesses to be called by Ben Roberts-Smith in his war crimes defamation trial have been accused of colluding in their evidence concerning a murder allegation against the SAS veteran before the federal court. In an argument over access to documents and whether they attract legal privilege, lawyers for the three newspapers being sued by Roberts-Smith have alleged the four soldiers have all given the “same, precise, demonstrably false error” in their outlines over an Afghan special forces member. Roberts-Smith’s lawyers said the newspapers’ allegation of collusion was scandalous, describing the arguments before court as “completely baseless” and “an attempt to prejudice the court and the public” against the witnesses. Roberts-Smith and the four other SAS soldiers have all provided statements of evidence that state an Afghan police special forces officer – known as Person 12 – was not present on an Australian SAS mission to Khaz Uruzgan in October 2012. The court has previously heard evidence on behalf of the defendant newspapers that an unarmed prisoner was allegedly murdered on Roberts-Smith’s orders during that mission. The five statements say Person 12 could not have been present because he had previously been stood down from missions with the Australians for shooting a dog – and accidentally injuring an Australian soldier – on an earlier mission. Nicholas Owens SC told the court Person 12 was present on the Khaz Uruzgan mission, and during that mission relayed an order from Roberts-Smith to one of his subordinates to execute a detained prisoner. The order was followed and the prisoner was shot up to 10 times. The newspapers’ application, Owens told Justice Wendy Abraham on Friday, “is really as simple as saying five witnesses have had outlines of evidence filed on their behalf, each of which contains a highly specific and false account of a material matter”. “The account that is given has no relevance in itself. Its purpose in the case is only to provide a negative alibi [regarding Person 12] … in those circumstances we say that there is no explanation for that consistent with coincidence or innocent mistake, we say it shows a prima facie case of impropriety.” Owens said the coincident evidence represented a “fraud”, and so the soldiers’ correspondence with lawyers lost its privilege. He stressed solicitors were not accused of wrongdoing. “The fraud is the collusion between witnesses … multiple witnesses colluding together in relation to the evidence they will give at trial.” Owens said it was “utterly inconceivable that five people would make the same, precise, demonstrably false error” by innocent, coincidental mistake. Roberts-Smith, a Victoria Cross recipient and one of Australia’s most decorated soldiers, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges portray him as committing war crimes, including murder, as well as acts of bullying and domestic violence. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. The court has heard that during July 2012, Australian SAS were on a mission with members of the Afghan police special forces unit, known as the Wakunish, when a member of the Wakunish opened fire on a stray dog. Shrapnel from the assault hit and injured an Australian SAS soldier. Roberts-Smith had told the court he had understood it was a Wakunish commander, Person 12, who had fired at the dog and was subsequently removed from going on patrols with Australian SAS. In the witness box last year, Roberts-Smith told the court he later came to learn that it was not Person 12 who had been stood down, but maintained the he was not on the Khaz Uruzgan mission. The identity of the Wakunish member who shot the dog is critical because the newspapers allege that Person 12 was present at the Khaz Uruzgan mission in October 2012, and that Roberts-Smith ordered him to command one of his subordinates to kill a prisoner. The newspapers allege that towards the end of the Khaz Uruzgan mission, an Afghan man who had been detained inside the final compound cleared was being questioned by Roberts-Smith’s patrol through an interpreter. Also present were members of the Wakunish, including, according to the newspapers, Person 12, who was the officer commanding. During the interrogation of the prisoner, a member of Roberts-Smith’s patrol kicked at a discoloured area of the compound’s mud wall that appeared to be a recently constructed false wall. From behind the false wall fell a cache of weapons, including rocket-propelled grenades. According to the newspapers’ defence documents, Roberts-Smith saw the weapons fall out and turned to his interpreter, telling the interpreter to instruct Person 12 “shoot him or get his men to do it, or I’ll do it”. Person 12 allegedly instructed one of his subordinates to shoot the prisoner, who fired several shots into him, killing him. The soldier who discovered the cache, Person 14, gave evidence for the defendant newspapers earlier in this trial, saying he was standing behind the interpreter when Roberts-Smith twice gave the order “tell him to shoot him or I will”, pointing at the senior Wakunish officer on the mission, and gesturing towards the prisoner. “One of his soldiers … trained his suppressed M4 [rifle] on the Afghan man and unloaded five to eight rounds into his centre of … mass … his torso,” before shooting him twice more in the head and neck, Person 14 told the court. In court on Friday, Arthur Moses SC, for Roberts-Smith, said the newspapers’ allegation of collusion was scandalous, describing the arguments before court as “completely baseless” and “an attempt to prejudice the court and the public” against the witnesses. “These are serious allegations, not principled or based on evidence. This application should never have been brought. They should have known better.” Moses said there was no certainty, even now, over the identity of Person 12, pointing to the fact the newspapers’ had previously said he was also at an earlier mission in Darwan, but had since withdrawn that assertion. “There are serious questions over Person 12’s identity,” Moses said. “They [the newspapers] can’t even get it right as to who Person 12 is.” Roberts-Smith has consistently denied the allegation he ordered the execution. He told the court there were no prisoners in the final compound at Khaz Uruzgan, and that Person 12 was not on the mission. During his evidence last year, Roberts-Smith was asked by his barrister, Bruce McClintock SC, whether he had any PUCs (persons under control) with him or with his patrol when he was in the last compound. “No, we didn’t,” Roberts-Smith replied. “Did you order [the interpreter] to translate an order to Person 12 to kill a PUC?” “No, I did not … I never killed an unarmed prisoner.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In his outline of evidence, Roberts-Smith told the court: “I did not see Person 12, nor do I recall seeing the interpreter … during the mission. They were not ever in my presence and I did not have any conversation with them during the mission. As noted above, Person 12 was not present, as it was my understanding that Person 12 had been stood down well before this time.” In his statement of evidence to the court, Roberts-Smith said he had understood that it was Person 12 who had fired at the dog and that Person 12 had been removed from going on patrols with the Australians. In the witness box last year, Roberts-Smith told the court he later came to learn that it was not Person 12 who had been stood down for shooting the dog, but maintained the Afghan officer was not on the Khaz Uruzgan mission: “one way or another, Person 12 wasn’t there,” Roberts-Smith said. Justice Abraham has reserved her decision on the legal privilege of the soldiers’ documents. The trial proper will recommence on Monday, before Justice Anthony Besanko.",News/Australia news,Soldiers supporting Ben Roberts-Smith accused of colluding over section of evidence in defamation trial,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/08/soldiers-accused-of-colluding-over-allegation-evidence-supporting-ben-roberts-smith-in-defamation-trial
4/8/2022,"On 23 March, at 7am, Svetlana Zalizetskaya, editor-in-chief of the RIA-Melitopol news outlet, learned that armed men in a white jeep had arrived at her house. She wasn’t in the city but neighbours told her they saw men with machine guns taking her parents out. Russian soldiers had occupied Melitopol since early March, kidnapped the city’s mayor Ivan Fedorov and tried to force him to work on the Russian side. He refused. At the same time, the Russians began putting pressure on journalists: they needed to convince the population that the Russian army had come to “liberate the city from the Nazis”. Zalizetskaya learned that the Russians ransacked her house, took cash from her mother, and left with her 75-year-old father, saying they would return him in exchange for Svetlana. Someone called her from a Ukrainian number and told her in Russian that she had to come to Melitopol and stop “writing nasty things” on the largest Melitopol news website. In the background, she heard her father’s voice repeating, like a mantra: “They don’t beat me.” “They told me that, because of my activities, the blood of Russian soldiers would be on my hands,” she said. “I told them it was the Russians who had come to our land and were holding my father hostage.” Vladimir Putin has said that the purpose of the Russian invasion was “the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine”. Russian propagandists lied that Ukraine was run by “neo-Nazis and drug addicts”. All the power of propaganda was thrown at explaining to the Russians why bombs were flying into Ukrainian cities and why thousands of soldiers were killing Ukrainians. The Russian authorities banned the media from calling the “special operation for demilitarisation and denazification” a war. A phrase has been circulating on state TV channels from the lips of officials and public figures: “Russia does not start wars – it ends them.” It’s as if someone was using George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four as a roadmap for a parallel reality where “war is peace”. Russia has made it a goal to destroy independent journalism so that no one can record the atrocities its soldiers are committing on Ukrainian soil. On 2 April, the world saw photographs of cities liberated from Russian invaders in the Kyiv region: once-peaceful towns were strewn with the bodies of murdered citizens. According to official data, in Bucha, a mass grave of 300 people was discovered, among them women, the elderly and children. In the Vyshgorod district, north of Kyiv, the body of Ukrainian photojournalist Max Levin was found among the dead. He disappeared on 13 March, the day he went to photograph the offensive of Russian troops. The prosecutor-general’s office reported that he had been shot twice at close range. Max was wearing a bulletproof vest and a helmet with a “press” inscription that the killers must have seen. Max has four children. The youngest is two. At the beginning of the full-scale war, on 24 February, my colleagues and I created the 2402 Foundation emergency fund for journalists. Its slogan is “freedom needs eyes”. Our first task was to find bulletproof vests and helmets for hundreds of Ukrainian journalists who were completely “naked” in the middle of a war zone. We found them, but body armour and helmets do not protect from mortar fire, a Kalashnikov at close range or kidnapping. We are now more focused on helping with risk assessment and training in tactical medicine. Back then, little more than a month ago, I could not imagine how large-scale the elimination of journalists in Ukraine would be. According to various sources, between seven and 13 journalists have died since the invasion began, with more than 20 injured. Many are risking their lives to document Russia’s crimes in Ukraine, and journalists are one of the important targets of Russian soldiers. For them, “press” written on a car or helmet is like a red rag. I recently spoke with my colleagues from the Associated Press (AP) – Zhenya Maloletka and Mstyslav Chernov. We have known each other for more than eight years, since we started working as war correspondents in Donbas. They were practically the only journalists in the encircled city of Mariupol, and filmed the mass graves of people who died from the bombings and the shelling of the maternity hospital in which a woman in labour died. They didn’t expect to witness so many war crimes. They managed to escape Mariupol, despite Russian federal channels announcing a hunt for them, saying their photographs were staged as “Nazi propaganda”. They passed 16 Russian checkpoints on their way out. I’d call it a miracle rather than luck. Is it worth risking your life for photos and videos? This is the discussion among Ukrainian journalists. From my point of view, it will be a miracle if journalism proves Russia’s guilt in war crimes in international courts. If photographs could stop war and restore justice some decades ago, today it doesn’t help. After the Russians bombed the Mariupol theatre, which killed at least 300 people sheltering there, the west didn’t close the skies over Ukraine or even fully turn off the Swift payment system in Russia. I doubt that any tough action will follow after photos are published from Bucha and Irpin. The world just watches the pain of others and expresses deep concern. Russia unleashed a war in Ukraine eight years ago. The false accusations of Maidan participants of “fascism” became a reason to annex Crimea and help occupy part of the Donbas. But Russia doesn’t want witnesses to its crimes. Many Ukrainian journalists, such as Hromadske TV’s Nastya Stanko and Radio Liberty writer Stanislav Aseyev, have been held captive and tortured for reporting on what is happening in the occupied territories. Hundreds of reporters have risked their lives and health so that the world can see what Russia is capable of, and that Russia wants to destroy Ukrainians. The Russians shot down a Malaysian plane with 298 people aboard in 2014. The Russians imprisoned dozens of Ukrainian citizens simply because they were against the annexation of Crimea. For eight years, Russia has committed many crimes recorded by journalists, but the world just watched the pain and did nothing to stop this fresh tragedy. Zalizetskaya’s father was released three days after the Russians took him. In exchange, the Russians demanded she renounce the RIA-Melitopol news outlet on social media. Her family is still in the occupied city without the opportunity to leave, because the Russians kept her father’s passport. Parts of the south and east of Ukraine are controlled by Russia. From the first days, they detained activists and journalists. On 31 March, journalist Kostyantin Ryzhenko disappeared in Kherson. His father, Oleksander Ryzhenko, told the press that the Russians came to him and demanded to know where the journalist was, claiming “he has a lot of blood on him” and he was a “nationalist”. A little earlier, the so-called “Donetsk people’s republic” military kidnapped journalist Iryna Dubchenko and is holding her captive in Donetsk. Russia is trying to silence journalists with all available violent means. Unpunished evil for eight years gave birth to real evil. And this threatens the very concept of truth.

4/8/2022,"Good morning to you all, Graham Russell here with the news you need to end the week. Akshata Murty, the chancellor’s wife, has potentially avoided up to £20m in UK tax by being non-domiciled, leading to Labour accusations of “breathtaking hypocrisy” against Rishi Sunak. The heiress has collected about 5.4bn Indian rupees (£54.5m) in dividends from Infosys, the India-based IT business founded by her father, over the past seven-and-a-half years, the period for which there is public data. Non-dom status for that whole period could have saved her about £20m in UK taxes. The furore risks further damaging Sunak’s public image already battered by a mini-budget forecast to lead to the biggest drop in living standards since records began in the 1950s. Labour wrote to Sunak, saying it was “in the vital public interest” that he provide clarity on issues including whether he had benefited from his wife’s status, how long she had claimed it and how much she had saved. “As chancellor it is crucial you both follow the rules and lead by example,” said James Murray, the shadow financial secretary. Murty’s spokesperson initially characterised her tax status as a function of her Indian citizenship, but tax experts said non-dom status was not automatic but a choice. Prof Richard Murphy, who co-founded the Tax Justice Network, said the claim was “simply wrong. She is only non-domiciled because she asked to be so.” Murty’s spokesperson said they had no comment on the £20m figure beyond reiterating she paid relevant taxes on UK and overseas incomes. They accepted that people with such tax arrangements could theoretically minimise payments using tax havens, while saying they had no comment as to whether Murty did this. Murty has previously collected other dividend income via the tax haven of Mauritius, which does not tax dividends. If non-domicile tax status has not been a priority in your personal tax affairs, here is a handy guide to what it is. Also a guide to the wealth of a woman richer than the Queen. Ukraine – Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has said Russia has suffered “significant” troop losses in its war against Ukraine, describing them as “a huge tragedy for us”. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has foreshadowed more atrocities, saying the situation in the town of Borodyanka was “much more disastrous” than in Bucha. A fresh offensive is expected in the east, and Kyiv has called for more heavy weaponry from its western allies and “ruinous” sanctions against Moscow, saying the assault on eastern Ukraine would remind Nato members of the second world war. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told a meeting of his counterparts in the alliance in Brussels on Thursday: “I think the deal that Ukraine is offering is fair. You give us weapons, we sacrifice our lives, and the war is contained in Ukraine. This is it.” Benjamin Hall, a British reporter for Fox News, has said he feels “pretty damn lucky” to be alive after suffering serious injuries in a shelling in Kyiv in which two of his colleagues died. Boris Johnson is set to host the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, at Downing Street on Friday amid discussions on how to help Europe wean itself off Russian gas imports. You can find our at-a-glance guide here, and the latest events on our liveblog. Refugee education – Charity workers in Manchester say hundreds of children of asylum seekers and refugees are being taught in the car parks of hotels where they live because no school place has been found for them. Dr Rhetta Moran from charity Refugee and Asylum Participatory Action Research said: “Many of these children have been victims of war and persecution … and upon arrival they are faced with lengthy delays in our asylum and immigration system.” She said some lessons involved learning maths on the ground using chalk. Manchester city council said it had placed more than 400 such children in schools and colleges and that hotel staff were made aware of the need for families to apply for a school place. Stuck in the middle – Health authorities are urging people to ensure their waist size is less than half their height, amid rising concern about obesity rates. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence makes the appeal today to adults with a body mass index (BMI) under 35 to help them stave off health problems and save a struggling NHS. By using the ratio together with BMI, people can work out whether they are carrying excess fat around their middle, which is known to raise the risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease. Justice for all – Ketanji Brown Jackson has navigated a rancorous US Senate approval process to become the first Black woman to serve in the supreme court in its more than 200-year history. At 51, Jackson is young enough to serve on the court for decades. Her ascension, however, will do little to tilt the ideological balance of the high court, dominated by a 6-3 conservative majority. But it does mean for the first time in the court’s history that white men are in the minority. Joe Biden called it “a historic moment for our nation. We’ve taken another step toward making our highest court reflect the diversity of America.” You can find more reaction here, plus analysis of the QAnon-tinged questioning she faced from some Republicans. Holiday rush – Passengers have been warned of delays as airlines and cross-Channel services brace for their busiest weekend since the start of the pandemic. Transport hubs are already struggling to cope with the Easter holiday surge and staff shortages brought on by Covid. Eurotunnel expects rising traffic in both directions and P&O Ferries services remain suspended. P&O rival DFDS is also now fully booked. Airports are redeploying office staff with security clearance to frontline roles and passengers have been advised to allow extra time. EasyJet, which had to axe hundreds of flights this week, said it would be pre-emptively cancelling a further 50 flights a day over the weekend to minimise disruption. After the rapid withdrawal of Russian forces from the suburbs around Kyiv, the full scale of the atrocities they had committed were exposed to the world this week. The Guardian’s Daniel Boffey was one of the first reporters to witness the scene of multiple war crimes in Bucha.

Here, Elle Hardy takes a look at whether it can function as a church rather than a brand after its recent troubles. Tiger Woods says he is “right where I need to be” with a one-under-par round of 71 at the Masters after his remarkable recovery from serious injury. Woods commanded huge gallery support at Augusta National, having not played competitive golf since November 2020, and 14 months on from a serious car crash that left him fearing his lower right leg may need to be amputated. Amid signs of the old magic, there is more to come, writes Andy Bull. Serena Williams has hinted that she will make her return to tennis at this year’s Wimbledon. She has not played professionally since last year’s event, where she withdrew early in her first-round match with a hamstring injury. Emails have been released that appear to show the state of Abu Dhabi facilitating payments to Manchester City, reigniting the controversy that led to the club receiving a ban from European competition that was ultimately overturned at the court of arbitration for sport. City would not comment on the allegations but sources close to the club said the new reports were a continuation of an “orchestrated campaign” and part of “an endless attempt to damage us”. Once his anger at Felix Zwayer’s officiating has faded, David Moyes will look back at West Ham’s draw against Lyon and conclude that their Europa League dream is far from over. It will stand West Ham in good stead when the quarter-final resumes at Stade de Gerland next week. In the Premier League, here are 10 things to look out for this weekend. Boris Johnson has been “held to ransom” by his backbenches after failing to back onshore windfarms in his energy plan, the shadow energy secretary, Ed Miliband, has said. Energy experts and environmental groups labelled the plan – which set targets for long-term expansion of nuclear, offshore wind and solar capacity – “inadequate”, warning it would do little to address sky-high bills and reduce dependence on gas imports, including from Russia. The energy crisis has seen customer service levels among providers plummet to their lowest since 2017. The pound is buying $1.306 and €1.203. The furore over the tax status of Akshata Murty, Rishi Sunak’s wife, continues on many front pages today. The Guardian says she may have avoided £20m in tax, while the Mirror reports she has benefited from £50m in UK public sector contracts. The Daily Mail gives its picture slot to Murty, reporting that she chose to be non-domiciled in the UK, but its main story is Sajid Javid talking about “women only” hospital wards. The fightback is spearheaded by the broadsheets and the Sun. The Times focuses on Sunak’s concerns that the tax story was timed to coincide with his raising of national insurance contributions. “Sunak fears revelations over wife are ‘hit job’” is the headline. The Telegraph suggests that No 10 is briefing against Sunak (a suggestion Treasury sources have said in their view is “categorically not true”). The headline is: “Sunak allies claim No 10 undermining chancellor”. The tabloid claims an exclusive with the headline: “Lay off my missus”. The i also claims an exclusive, reporting Sunak blocked plans to further ease the cost-of-living crisis. “Sunak vetoed extra help on energy bills” is the headline. Metro has “human rights pariah” with news that Russia has been ejected from the UN’s human rights council. The FT also sticks with Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine, with the headline: “Rusal becomes first Russian group to call for Bucha war crime inquiry”.
