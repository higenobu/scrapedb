1/22/2022,"Mike Ashley has initiated legal action against Amanda Staveley, the co-owner of Newcastle United, for allegedly breaching the terms of a £10m loan he provided in order to help facilitate the club’s £300m sale to a Saudi Arabian led consortium last October. A representative of Staveley, who has a 10% stake in Newcastle while Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF)has an 80% controlling interest and the property developers Reuben Brothers another 10%, said on Friday night she was “very confident” of successfully defending Ashley’s attempt to secure the immediate return of the loan.  Ashley, who owned Newcastle for 14 years, alleges that, by removing the signage promoting his company Sports Direct from St James’ Park Staveley has reneged on an agreement to continue advertising his business at the stadium until the end of this season. Documents submitted at the high court in London by the retail magnate’s legal team reveal he wants the loan repaid immediately and also claim the Yorkshire-born financier has broken another pledge not to criticise his stewardship of the club in the media. Ashley is jointly suing Mehrdad Ghodoussi, Staveley’s husband, for his role as guarantor of the supposedly two-year loan intended to cover, among other things, Staveley’s legal costs incurred during the purchase of Newcastle. Documents relating to the case deposited by the retailer’s lawyers also suggest that Staveley funded her 10% share in Newcastle thanks to a £30m loan from Reuben Brothers. A spokesperson for Staveley and Ghodoussi said the couple, who have a management contract to run Newcastle on a daily basis, “do not intend commenting on the litigation but are very confident of successfully defending the claim in full”.",Sport/Football,Mike Ashley takes legal action against Newcastle co-owner Amanda Staveley,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/21/mike-ashley-takes-legal-action-against-newcastle-co-owner-amanda-staveley
1/22/2022,"Lock up your rabbits! The 1987 thriller that inspired the phrase “bunny boiler” – to describe a psychotically clingy lover – is back. Fatal Attraction exploited the terror of sexual promiscuity in the shadow of Aids, as well as the Reagan-era idealisation of the nuclear family. Cinema audiences booed the vengeful woman spurned by her married lover. Has the emphasis shifted now that gaslighting, white-male privilege and #MeToo have entered the lexicon? The script by James Dearden, who also wrote the film, gives the errant husband Dan Gallagher (Oliver Farnworth) narrating privileges (“You think I’m crazy? You’d be right!”) but few glimmers of self-knowledge. More modulation from Farnworth would have been nice. Announcing bleakly that he once had it all, he sounds scarcely less peevish during flashbacks to happier days.  Kym Marsh as Alex, who slashes her wrists then stalks Dan and his family, exhibits restraint in not vamping it up immediately. But the play still makes her blandly monstrous; an effect worthy of Attack of the 50 Foot Woman imagines her looming over Manhattan via video screen. Telling the story from Alex’s perspective could have repurposed the material to better suit the times. There isn’t much point incorporating mobile phones, feng shui and Covid fist bumps if the attitude still smacks of the 1980s. One radical difference is the ending, which sticks to Dearden’s downbeat original draft that never made it to the film’s final cut. Other scenes narrate what can’t be shown (“Sulphuric acid! The car’s completely ruined!”) or downgrade what can. No groping in the elevator, no sex in the sink. There isn’t enough heat on stage to toast a bunny, let alone boil one. John Macaulay as Dan’s pal Jimmy has one devilish scene. After Alex reveals she is pregnant, he offers his friend a cheerful take worthy of Seinfeld’s George Costanza: “It’s early days. She could lose the baby!” Everything is eclipsed, though, by the death of Bugs. On screen, we saw only the shocking aftermath. On stage, Alex hoists the pot on to the stove, cranks up the gas, then strolls away with a wicked smile. It’s such a leisurely enterprise that it seems churlish not to add seasoning. Fatal Attraction is at the Theatre Royal, Brighton, until 22 January then touring.",Arts/Stage,Fatal Attraction review – stage thriller is an affair to forget,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/21/fatal-attraction-review-stage
1/22/2022,"Pep Guardiola has said he may decide at the end of the season whether to sign a new contract at Manchester City and will not “betray” the club whenever he leaves.  The manager is in his sixth year at the champions and has a deal to summer 2023. Guardiola, who was 51 on Tuesday and has previously coached Barcelona and Bayern Munich in a 14-year career, says he continues to feel energised by the job. “I’m not good enough to think far away,” he said. “My future always depends on results. So, play Southampton [on Saturday], rest a little bit then [carry on] and at the end of the season we’ll see what happens.” Guardiola offered insight into how his passion is retained. “Still we can play better, still some players can improve [and] I see things I don’t like. I won’t think about the future when I still have the contract I have.” Asked how long he could continue in elite-level management, Guardiola said: “I don’t know – I feel good and comfortable. When I’m not energetic and feel a little bit drained or tired, I’m pretty sure I will quit. But right now, I feel good. “My decision [when to leave City] will be taken with the club. They gave me everything so I cannot betray them. Or do anything wrong to them. That would not be nice. Together we took decisions for me to come here and to extend the contract two times [until now] and it will be the same [in future]: it depends how they feel about me, how I feel myself in the club. “Now I never think for 24 hours a day what is going to happen far away. In football the end of the season is far away.” Guardiola’s team are hoping to win a 13th consecutive league match at Southampton. He praised the set-piece delivery of Southampton’s captain, James Ward-Prowse. “He’s the best taker right now worldwide,” he said. “There isn’t [anyone] better than Ward-Prowse. He’s so good at it that maybe you miss his quality as a player as well. He is a guy who adapts in midfield positions, a team player who has great quality with or without the ball. At free-kicks, corners he is exceptional.”",Sport/Football,Pep Guardiola will make Manchester City contract decision at end of season,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/21/pep-guardiola-will-make-manchester-city-contract-decision-at-end-of-season
1/22/2022,"Ralf Rangnick believes Cristiano Ronaldo was too emotional at being replaced during Manchester United’s win at Brentford and has urged him to temper his behaviour for the benefit of the team. The 36-year-old, who is a doubt for Saturday’s home match against West Ham due to a neck injury, was taken off on 71 minutes with United 2-0 ahead as Rangnick switched to a back three, and the unhappy player immediately demanded an explanation. On Friday Rangnick was asked whether he accepted Ronaldo’s behaviour did not look good because it appeared a challenge to his authority.  “I don’t blame him for that but obviously any manager would wish it shouldn’t be too emotional and also in front of the TV cameras I don’t think this will be for the benefit of anyone: not to his benefit or teammates,” the interim manager said. “It’s an emotional game and players are emotional and I didn’t take it personally at all. “I didn’t at all see or interpret that he was challenging me. This was not the first time – if you have a look at the moment when Sir Alex [Ferguson] replaced him or other coaches, his reaction was pretty similar, which shows in the end it has got nothing to do with the manager. It’s about his own ambition and desire to stay on the pitch. “It’s a team sport and for us it’s important for us that we get the most out of each game, the maximum points, and it’s a decision of each manager [regarding] what we need right now in order to win. I’m not somebody who says afterwards everything was perfect but in this case everything that I had hoped regarding the result of that decision was confirmed in the end.” Victor Lindelöf will not be available for Saturday’s match after what Rangnick described as a “traumatic” break-in at the defender’s house. Lindelöf was playing at Brentford when intruders entered while his family were there. They were said to be shaken but unjurt. “The club will speak to the players in the next couple of weeks and hopefully be able to make their houses more safe in the future,” said Rangnick. Harry Maguire will replace Lindelöf, and Rangnick will speak with Jadon Sancho to determine whether the forward is ready to play after attending the funeral of someone close.",Sport/Football,Ralf Rangnick calls Ronaldo’s reaction to being substituted ‘too emotional’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/21/ronaldo-reaction-substituted-manchester-united-brentford-too-emotional-ralf-rangnick
1/22/2022,"The demands of three knockout ties in eight days, including a Spanish Super Cup final in Saudi Arabia, sparked a rare outburst this week from Carlo Ancelotti but amid anger over the “absolute nonsense” of Real Madrid’s schedule he made time for a gratefully received phone call. The recipient was Duncan Ferguson. “Carlo phoned me when he heard the news and said to me: ‘Be yourself. You’re ready.’ That gave me a bit of confidence,” admitted Ferguson, who has been tasked with lifting Everton spirits and relegation fears as caretaker manager once again. “I worked with Carlo for a couple of seasons and he told me to go for it, to be myself: ‘You know what you’re doing and you’ve got the experience on the training ground.’ He said: ‘You’re ready.’ That gave me a bit of a boost, to be honest, hearing it from a guy like that who has done it all.”  In caretaker terms Ferguson has been there and done it too, although there were noticeable differences in his demeanour on the eve of facing Steven Gerrard’s Aston Villa to when he took on, and beat, Frank Lampard’s Chelsea the last time he managed at Goodison Park. In December 2019 Ferguson was appointed interim manager less than 48 hours before the game. He could not sleep that night and ran a bath at 2.30am. His voice cracked with emotion and his eyes welled with tears as discussed Everton’s “devastating” slide and his pride at leading the team. This time, with four days to prepare for Villa alongside Leighton Baines and John Ebbrell, it was a more relaxed, more self-aware Ferguson who addressed the media. A lesson learned from Ancelotti? “Obviously Carlo was calm, wasn’t he?” he replied. “He has seen it all. Things like that, his calmness, tactically he was fantastic, and I picked up loads of things from him but you have to be yourself. You pick up experiences but I just want to be myself. That’s what you’ll see tomorrow and that’s what you see on the training ground.” In other words, and as Ferguson put it, the ball boys had better be careful should Everton score on Saturday. There has been another marked change about Ferguson this week. He was a first-team coach with no real prospect of landing the job permanently when he replaced Marco Silva in 2019, and adopted an arm-around-the-shoulder approach with Dominic Calvert-Lewin and others as a result. Now, as an assistant manager with several games to press his claims to replace Rafael Benítez, the blunt and formidable character of old has re-emerged. “The way I’ve dealt with it over the last few days is that it has not been good enough,” Ferguson said. “It’s been a long time losing, losing, losing and not getting results. So the gloves are off now. You know what I mean? You can get right in there, right after them [the players] because everybody knows in the club, in the city, that the performances have not been at the level we expect. I’ve got right into them over that. “People have to be told a few home truths. The form has not been good enough and the fans expect much, much more. We are here for the fans, that’s it. We are here to play for them so I got that message to them, but in stronger terms than that.” Everton say they want to appoint a new manager as quickly as possible and he will align with an ongoing strategic review into the entire football operation, even though the review is unlikely to be completed until later this year. A strategic aim is to have a clear Everton “DNA” running through the club. On that basis Ferguson’s prospects, along with those of Wayne Rooney, are enhanced. But this is Everton under Farhad Moshiri, a billionaire whose “largesse cannot be faulted but whose decision making as Everton’s majority shareholder, and the advice he has continued to follow from a few influential agents, is now open to ridicule”. That quoted line was written when Ferguson was unveiled as caretaker manager just over two years ago. Every word still stands, unfortunately for those who will pack out Goodison on Saturday. Ferguson is 50 years old. Ancelotti, who has won the Champions League three times as a coach, believes the Scot is ready. Ferguson, wisely in the circumstances, avoided becoming hostage to fortune when asked whether it was now or never for his chances of managing Everton full time. He said, quite brilliantly: “The club are looking for experience, aren’t they? I believe in myself and I believe one day I’ll become a great manager. I know I can do the coaching. Hopefully one day, whenever that day is, I’ll become the permanent Everton manager. Of course they are always going to be looking out for the top boys, the guys with the big CVs and the guys who have won trophies. And so they should. At the end of the day we are one of the greatest clubs in the world. Why not look for one of the greatest managers in the world?” An Everton great will be close to Ferguson when his managerial career resumes against Villa. Howard Kendall’s wife, Lily, presented Ferguson with a watch that belonged to her late husband before he started a three-game unbeaten stint as caretaker in 2019. “I will be wearing it again, absolutely,” he confirmed. “That watch is mine now, forever.”",Sport/Football,Duncan Ferguson steps up to plate at Everton with Ancelotti’s backing,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/21/duncan-ferguson-steps-up-to-plate-at-everton-with-ancelottis-backing
1/22/2022,"Emma Raducanu has said she has no regrets about taking to the court on Thursday while injured with blisters on her right hand, despite not everyone in her team encouraging her to compete. The British teenager said she intends to use her experience and performance to strive for more success at the Australian Open and beyond, while also admitting “it’s definitely a lot of work to stay at the top”. “Once I stepped out on the court I’d made my decision,” said Raducanu. “I had the option to withdraw before the match but after everything, the Covid, making it out here, fighting back from the loss last week, I wanted to give it all I had. I’m on the other side of the world! And I know my hand is going to recover in two days. It’s not long-term. I can build on this pretty quickly and start working on my game again.”  Raducanu was speaking after her first senior Australian Open came to an end with a three-set loss to Danka Kovinic in the second round. Raducanu suffered from blisters on her right hand and was forced to spend a large part of the match slicing forehands. Her Australian Open journey may have ended but it has been most instructive for Raducanu as her development continues. According to Raducanu, the blisters were likely brought on by a combination of different factors, from the amount of time she spent without a racket during Covid to her inexperience with managing humidity and heat: “It’s very rare for me to be that long away from tennis so I think my hands definitely suffered from that. Then coming here you want to make up the hours but I think you need to be smart about it. Also, the humidity – I’m not experienced with why that should be, but it’s good to learn.” Regardless, other lessons were learnt on Thursday in the process. As Raducanu sat in her chair five games into the second round of her first Australian Open, she had every reason to think her day was over. Every time she attempted to strike a serve or forehand, the blisters on her right ring finger rubbed against her racket, causing serious discomfort and pain. Not only did she show fight and adaptability by successfully irritating Kovinic with guile instead of power, but the numerous slices she attempted off both wings were of surprisingly good quality. In her young career, Raducanu has shown her strengths lie in her ability to hold her position on top of the baseline, taking the ball early and changing directions with ease as she attacks. But variety has been lacking in her game. The amount of room for improvement in Raducanu’s game should be particularly exciting for her new coach, Torben Beltz. Raducanu recently said she does not actually practise her slice so there is an opportunity to work on her becoming a more complete player, utilising slices to effectively change up the pace in rallies and having drop-shots as a consistent option. While being unable to compete at her highest level was a source of disappointment, it is no tragedy. As the tour navigates the first few weeks of the season, a great benefit of the tennis calendar is the number of opportunities over the course of a year to add wins, find form and achieve successful results. Raducanu will now have to decide whether or not to head to the Middle East in order to compete in tournaments in Doha and Dubai before the big US hard court tournaments in March. In the meantime, some lessons have already been learned. Raducanu says that recent weeks and months have alerted her to the reality of what it takes to stay on top. “It’s definitely a lot of work to stay at the top,” she said. “When I was lower down the ranks I definitely thought that once you were in that top bracket you could stay there. But you can’t. You pretty much have to be on it every week. Be really focused, really work hard. I think I’ve put it in on this trip.” Raducanu said she had enjoyed her time regardless. Although all of her energy was on work, including 12-hour days on site at Melbourne Park, she took some time to see the city before the tournament began. “I’ve been trying to do some steps. I got this number fixated in my head – 10,000 – because I was doing that in my room during isolation. But I stopped it before the tournament.”",Sport/Sport,Raducanu leaves Melbourne with no regrets but new desire to ‘stay at the top’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/21/emma-raducanu-melbourne-no-regrets-australian-open-tennis
1/22/2022,"Jürgen Klopp has demonstrated his faith in Caoimhín Kelleher by confirming the second-choice goalkeeper will start next month’s Carabao Cup final against Chelsea. Kelleher is Liverpool’s regular selection for this season’s competition and delivered another assured performance in Thursday’s semi-final second-leg win at Arsenal. Despite the availability of Alisson, “the best goalie in the world” according to his manager, and Liverpool’s 10-year wait for domestic cup success, Klopp believes it is crucial for Kelleher’s long-term future at Anfield to have a starting role at Wembley on 27 February.  “Caoimhín will play, if he is fit,” he said. “As a football manager you have to consider a lot of things and one of the things is we consider Caoimhín an outstanding goalie. Not a good goalie, an outstanding goalie, and we want to keep him here. And to keep him you need to make sure of a few things. Before a season you need to think and talk about about the different games he will get. “It is all about performing of course. If he didn’t perform on the level he performed then I would maybe think differently. But he has shown he deserves all the trust and faith that we have in him. I didn’t think about it properly, but my idea in this moment is to play him. I don’t see any reason why we should not do that. Caoimhín deserves that. He brought the team there.” Klopp credits Liverpool’s goalkeeping coach, John Achterberg, with turning “a skinny boy from Ireland standing in this big goal” to a mature and commanding 23-year-old Republic of Ireland international. “Last week against Arsenal I had to explain to Caoimhín why he is not playing,” Klopp said of the first leg. “I usually do not do that, but it was his competition and I thought Ali needs the game because he was lacking rhythm after Covid. What I really liked was that Caoimhín was not like: ‘Oh yes, I understand.’ He was: ‘What? Why?’ So he matures in all departments. That is the goalie we want. “This is really the John Achterberg project. When Caoimhín first came here there were not all the people in the club who thought: ‘Caoimhín Kelleher will be the next goalkeeper.’ There was one person: John. If you have to buy this goalkeeper now then it is pretty expensive. Now we have the best in the world and a really, really good one. That is a good situation.”",Sport/Football,Klopp confirms Liverpool’s Caoimhín Kelleher will start Carabao Cup final,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/21/klopp-confirms-liverpools-caoimhin-kelleher-will-start-carabao-cup-final
