Hitherto he had seen this as something alien to his understanding of his mission. That was my feeling when, at the start of a year as lord mayor of Bradford in 2016, I was expected to use Twitter on a daily basis. Apparently it was a 21st-century civic tradition and it was expected of me. The only way I could cope with this alien activity was by reflecting on the day’s activities for up to half an hour and carefully crafting a suitable sentence arising out of one event, a harmless ritual that some people appreciated. Marina Hyde’s assertion that arguing on the internet qualifies you as a twat is perfectly sound (What better owner for Twitter than Elon Musk, master of the ill-advised tweet?, 26 April). I would want to add that letting your fingers run ahead of your brain on any digital platform should always be avoided.Geoff ReidBradford  If Elon Musk was really keen to use Tesla for a “radical green energy transition”, he’d make his cars cheaper, and the Tesla charging points would be open to all e-car owners, rather than just being exclusive proprietary hardware. Apart from that, he wouldn’t emit so many tonnes of CO2 shooting cars stupidly into space, and he wouldn’t distract us all from our common fate on Earth with his fairytales (presumably also proprietary) about the future on Mars and beyond. If there’s to be any kind of “radical transition” that offers us all a future, it has absolutely nothing to do with Musk and his ilk.Alastair PennyDurbuy, Belgium  Joel Golby suggests that the best thing Elon Musk can do is delete Twitter (27 April). He’s not going to do that. However, those who are concerned about a self-promoting billionaire controlling online discourse have a simple solution: delete your own Twitter account. I know that these online platforms have a way of becoming addictive and users feel that they cannot live without their “drug of choice” – but really, we lived for thousands of years without Twitter. Anything that was so popular with Donald Trump must be suspect – and if enough people just delete their accounts, it will die. That would be worthwhile and really funny: to see Musk so spectacularly “burned”.Martin CoultLondon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

4/30/2022,"A group representing domestic football leagues is hopeful of killing plans to make Champions League places dependent on historic performance, believing they will find “common ground” with Uefa to stop the controversial proposal. The European Leagues, which represents domestic competitions from across the continent including the Premier League, said that they believed their support for qualification on “sporting merit” and a lower number of fixtures in a still expanded Champions League would result in a “wise and good” decision by Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin. A plan to award two places in an expanded Champions League to clubs that would otherwise have qualified for the Europa League but have strong recent records in Europe, was proposed in Uefa’s Club Competition Committee (UCCC) and endorsed by the influential European Club Association last month. Speaking on Friday, however, the president of the European Leagues, Claus Thomsen, reiterated a commitment to the principle of qualifying based on domestic performance. “We believe the principle of sporting merit is the heart of the football model,” he said. “It’s still our firm belief and position that such a thing can’t be introduced into the European club competitions. “We have had good dialogue with Uefa on this and think we will find common ground with this. Raising these issues are not contrary to Uefa. It is fair to say our expectation is that Uefa also has the position of sporting merit being at the core of European and domestic competitions.” Jaco Swart, the managing director of the European Leagues, said that Ceferin had committed himself to maintaining football’s tie to sporting merit in the wake of the European Super League. “We have been carefully listening to the president over the last year,” he said, “and we do count on his responsibility and the fact that he will take a wise and good decision in the line with our position.” The European Leagues are also pushing back on on further detail of Uefa’s proposed reforms to the Champions League in 2024. With a league format set to replace the group stage, the number of guaranteed fixtures played by each qualifier would rise from six to 10 per season, creating a further 100 matches in the competition. The Leagues want a compromise figure of eight “league stage” matches, believing they have the support not only of domestic competitions but broadcasters too. “An increase of more than 50% of games will hurt the vast majority of clubs and benefit very few,” said Thomsen. “We need to have a lower number of rounds. [Uefa] also have the position that we need to balance match-day calendars for all competitions to have a positive development.” Both the calendar and qualification is set to be discussed at a meeting of the UCCC on 10 May, though there is currently no deadline for a final decision to be taken.",Sport/Football,Uefa asked to drop Champions League ‘historic performance’ entry plan,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/29/uefa-asked-to-drop-champions-league-historic-performance-entry-plan
4/30/2022,"Everyone knows someone sickeningly good at landing themselves a sweet new gig. Schmoozing, getting coffee, doing beers, touching base, LinkedTok, all a mystery to those who serve in the galley of the good ship Fiver, serving you meagre morsels of tea-time bitterness. For The Fiver, the job interview is something to send the ticker into overdrive, all that talk of where you see yourself in five years (here, probably … er, hopefully). And how, if anything, you are too much of a perfectionist. You get up, offer your clammy paws for a handshake, leave the room and then realise your flies were undone all that time, and then, a couple of days later, you are thanked for your application and wished the best for the future. No such problems for Ralf Rangnick. The Gideon Osborne of fußball is to be the new Austrian national team coach, a role he will fulfil alongside the two-year consultancy role he landed at Manchester United to follow on from his current interim manager position. As season’s end approaches, Big Red are on course for the same 64 points total posted in the David Moyes annus horribilis of 2013-14, though only should they win their final three matches. On Monday, Brentford visit Old Trafford, Thomas Frank having gained a taste for poking the eye of the elite. Who’s responsible? Well, Ole Gunnar Solskjær sobbed his last after the 12th Premier League match of the season, a 4-1 loss at Watford, leaving Ralfie 26 matches to turn things around before he donned his consultancy chinos, having laid strong foundations for the next man. The evidence of Thursday’s 1-1 draw with Chelsea, where Cristiano Ronaldo scored the equaliser and the rest of United’s players shuffled around like schoolboys asked to perform contemporary dance, was that Ralfie has done no such thing. He will probably be best recalled by Top Reds for telling it like it is: that United are bloody rubbish. What of that future United consultancy role? Recruitment’s the short answer, signing some talent so that Erik ten Hag lasts longer than 10 months. “That we bring in the best possible players, it is not only identifying but meeting them, convincing them to join the club even though we will not play in [Big Cup],” he honked. Though the great man clearly needs little advice in the field of convincing people, a Fiver suggestion is to avoid, at all costs, showing potential recruits any videos of Manchester United playing football under the interim management of Ralf Rangnick. “Mark’s had a cotton bud in his ear that has gone in too far.

4/30/2022,"Neil Parish, the Conservative MP for Tiverton and Honiton, has reported himself to the parliamentary authorities over allegations that he watched pornography in the House of Commons chamber. Rumours about the identity of the MP had been rife in Westminster since it emerged earlier this week that a female Conservative minister had reported seeing a colleague watching pornography on his phone in the Commons – an account corroborated by another MP. A spokesperson for the chief whip, Chris Heaton-Harris, said Parish was reporting himself to the Standards committee of the House of Commons over the allegations. “Mr Parish has been suspended from the Conservative whip pending the outcome of that investigation,” the spokesperson said. Boris Johnson had encouraged witnesses to report the individual’s behaviour to the independent complaints and grievance scheme, which polices MPs’ behaviour; but was facing pressure to take more immediate action. Parish has held the safe Conservative seat of Tiverton and Honiton, in Devon, since 2010, winning it with a huge majority of 24,239 in 2019. He is the chair of the Defra select committee, known at Westminster as a champion for animals and farming, quizzing MPs in recent Commons appearances about fertiliser prices and greyhound racing. Before Parish’s name emerged, several Conservative MPs, including Nickie Aiken and Simon Hoare, had called on the unnamed MP accused of watching pornography to resign, rather than risk others being wrongly named. Parish gave an interview with GB News earlier this week, in which he was asked about allegations of a Conservative MP watching pornography. “I think the whips’ office will do a thorough investigation and we will wait and see that result and from that, then the decision will have to be made what action will be taken,” he said. Pressed on whether there was a problem with the culture at Westminster, Parish said, “We’ve got some 650 members of parliament in what is a very intense area. You are going to get people who step over the line.” He added: “It does have to be dealt with and dealt with seriously.”",News/Politics,Tory MP Neil Parish faces investigation over claims of watching pornography in Commons,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/29/tory-mp-neil-parish-faces-investigation-over-claims-of-watching-pornography-in-commons
4/30/2022,"Boris Becker has been jailed for two years and six months for hiding millions of pounds worth of assets after being made bankrupt in June 2017. The former tennis star had faced a jail sentence of up to 28 years under the Insolvency Act. He was found guilty of four charges by a jury at Southwark crown court earlier this month but acquitted of further 20 counts relating to his 2017 bankruptcy. Once nicknamed Britain’s favourite German – the 54-year-old once joked he was “top of a short list” – the six-time grand slam winner was worth about £38m in his heyday in prize money and sponsorship deals. Even after he retired, Becker’s good humour and colourful private life kept him in the public’s eye and affection, despite a previous conviction for tax evasion and attempted tax evasion in Germany in 2002. But sentenced on Friday for the lengths he went to to avoid paying his debts – which included removal of property, two counts of failing to disclose estate and concealing debt – Becker’s legacy has taken a severe blow.

4/30/2022,"Dear old Doctor Who has been in the doldrums. The pesky pandemic caused production delays, panicked rewrites and truncated series. Ratings have slumped, buzz has been badly lacking, and critical kickings have been administered. But all is not lost for the BBC franchise. Apart from the imminent return of showrunner Russell T Davies, there’s another ray of light – and it comes in the form of a transgender-led podcast. Written by Juno Dawson, Doctor Who: Redacted was launched alongside the Easter TV special, Legend of the Sea Devils, and has been described by the producer/director Ella Watts as “very gay, very trans”, and sitting “to the left” of the main show. The 10-part BBC Sounds audio drama follows three best mates who make “the Blue Box Files”, a paranormal conspiracy podcast about a certain police box popping up throughout history. Their tongue-in-cheek theorising suddenly gets all too real when they’re sucked into an action-packed alien adventure of their own. The cat is FINALLY out of the bag: I produced and directed a very gay, very trans OFFICIAL @BBCDoctorWho fiction podcast by @junodawson, starring @Charlie_Craggs, @iamrahh and @LoisChimimba and it comes out next sunday! #DoctorWhoRedacted 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈https://t.co/awuJnethPn pic.twitter.com/7fFIg4XIoE The friends are university dropouts, who now live in different UK cities but stay connected via their hobby podcast. The leader of the gang (and the drama) is a trans woman, Cleo, who works as a theatre usher, lives on a south London estate and is saving up for surgery. She’s played by transgender activist Charlie Craggs, a scene-stealer in her first ever acting role, who describes her casting as “a huge step for the trans community. I’m so honoured to be part of something so sacred to so many”. Juno Dawson always had Craggs in mind to play her protagonist. “She’s such a force,” says Dawson. “The label “trans activist” can be a club with which to beat trans people. It’s a dehumanising term, but Charlie uses her voice so cleverly – with humour and honesty. When it came to casting, I said to Ella: ‘Look, we can either audition Charlie Craggs or find a trans actor and tell her to play it like Charlie Craggs.’ There were some nerves at the BBC about hiring someone untrained but I’m so glad we stuck to our guns.” Founder of the podcast-within-a-podcast is devoted “boxspotter” and resident believer Abby (Vigil’s Lois Chimimba), who is bisexual and a full-time carer for her sick mother in Glasgow. The lineup is completed by sceptical Shawna (Grange Hill’s Holly Quin-Ankrah), an out-and-proud lesbian studying computing at her local college in Sheffield. Interestingly, this regional diversity is what came first for Dawson. “Being from Bradford myself, I adore hearing regional accents on the BBC,” she says. “I love that Doctor Who has lived its life in Cardiff, Sheffield and Liverpool in recent years. That regionality isn’t there enough in BBC drama, which is often kind of placeless. So, before I even thought about their gender or sexual identity, it was important to me that they were from different parts of the UK. Shawna was specified in the script as being a black or mixed-race woman from the north, whereas Abby was always going to be from Glasgow, which is one of my favourite cities.” “The three loser-teers”, as they self-deprecatingly style themselves, discover that everyone who has ever met the Doctor is disappearing, their very existence being forgotten. They’re being “redacted from reality”. Is there an allegorical significance here? “Somewhat,” says Dawson. “The notion of being silenced or erased feels part of the online language nowadays. But, I would say to the listener: it’s Doctor Who, don’t read too much into it. It’s more about a threat hanging over the world.” Ironically, the Blue Box Files is so unsuccessful that our heroines are the last names on the hitlist, making Cleo, Abby and Shawna the world’s only hope. They must race against time to uncover the truth and avert “end-of-the-world-type danger”. As the drama unfolds, they are joined by familiar faces – OK, voices – most notably, the 13th Doctor herself (Jodie Whittaker). Also reprising their Doctor Who spin-off roles are Rani Chandra (Anjli Mohindra) of The Sarah Jane Adventures, and UNIT’s Kate Stewart (Jemma Redgrave), Petronella Osgood (Ingrid Oliver) and Madame Vastra (Doon Mackichan). As well as the Time Lord’s allies, certain well-known monsters make an appearance too. “It was such a thrill to play with these beloved characters,” says Dawson. “It’s like borrowing someone else’s toy box. As long as you give the toys back in mint condition, you can just go mad. I was in the next room as Jodie was recording my dialogue, and admit I cried. I never cry! I never thought in a million years I’d get to see the Doctor reading dialogue I’d written for them.” 🎙️ The TARDIS visits @BBCSounds for Doctor Who: Redacted.Produced by @BBCStudios, @BBCDoctorWho spin-off podcast scripted by @JunoDawson will feature Jodie Whittaker and introduce stars @Charlie_Craggs, @LoisChimimba & Holly Quin-Ankrah.https://t.co/ZNvnFTAByK But the podcast is not just peppered with cameos, it also nods to Who storylines past and present. Tardis companions Martha, Ryan, Graham and Yaz get name-checked. So do previous TV plot details such as the dodgy dieting company Adipose Industries and that time an entire hospital got teleported to the moon by talking space rhinos. Not that Dawson wanted the podcast to be all about pleasing the purists. “I didn’t want it to be too heavy on fan service,” she says. “The reason Doctor Who’s been running for nearly 60 years is because it’s always kept the door open to new fans. Especially with each new Doctor, there’s an invitation to come in and join the party. But there are Easter eggs and little callbacks. The girls have a podcast investigating the legend of the Doctor, so it makes sense they’d be hunting for clues. At the same time, it tells its own story. You don’t need to have seen a lot of Doctor Who to understand Redacted.” The high-stakes narrative is cleverly interwoven with the trio’s personal lives. Abby might have a controlling boyfriend (“the man-baby”) lurking in the background but she and Shawna have a sweet will-they-won’t-they romantic subplot. Despite class clown Cleo insisting she’s “only here for the sass, babe”, we learn that her mother kicked her out when she started to transition in her teens, but is now seriously ill and trying to reconcile. “It’s hard not to feel for Cleo’s character,” Craggs has said. “You’d have to be some sort of sociopath not to empathise with what she’s going through with her mum.” Dawson agrees: “I wanted to highlight that Cleo’s had a difficult old life but, like Charlie, has developed a thick skin to hide her pain. That’s something that Russell T Davies did particularly well. If you make the humans’ lives feel real and layered, then, somehow, the sci-fi feels more real as well. There’s something delicious about seeing a Yeti on the tube or a Dalek going over Tower Bridge. It’s the extraordinary mixed with the ordinary. I wanted the characters to feel like your nextdoor neighbours.” She scripted four of the 10 episodes herself, with the rest credited to new writers – again, with a strong emphasis on diversity and regionality. With Redacted, bestselling author Dawson becomes the Doctor Who franchise’s first openly trans lead writer. For a lifelong Whovian who calls the show her “first love”, that’s a big deal. “When I watched Bonnie Langford [who played companion Mel] as a kid, I decided I wanted to be her,” she says. “And then Sophie Aldred came along as Ace, an even stronger character who killed Daleks with a baseball bat. Long before I knew I was a girl, I knew I was Mel and Ace. The show had a huge impact on me, so it’s a privilege to put my own little flag on the landscape.” Whittaker has enthused about working with Dawson and Craggs, saying “their energy is ace”. Redacted is, indeed, irresistibly sparky. Characters are powered by protein shakes and oat milk lattes. Episodes run to a pacy 20 minutes. The dark conspiracy plot is leavened by a script that zings with Drag Race lingo and gags about alien penises in jars. Harry Styles is hailed as “an honorary lesbian”. “Live, laugh, love” culture and boomers who leave voicemails are roundly ridiculed. It’s like a sci-fi remix of Mae Martin’s Feel Good. Or It’s A Sin with aliens also saying “La!”. As such, it’s going down a storm. “I was nervous because the fandom are so passionate,” says Dawson. “I’ve been that judgmental fan myself. But people have been incredibly positive. That goes for the queer and trans community too. A lot of the messages that I’m getting online are from people saying, ‘I feel seen’.” Doctor Who has long flirted with gay subtext. Since its 2005 reboot, queer characters include Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) and Madame Vastra’s wife, Jenny Flint, but it wasn’t until five years ago that the franchise introduced its first full-time LGBTQ+ companion, Bill Potts (played by Pearl Mackie). She was swiftly followed by Whittaker as the Doctor’s first female incarnation – recently revealing her feelings for companion Yaz (Mandip Gill). The show received an Ally award at the 2017 PinkNews Awards for its “long-standing LGBT inclusiveness”. Now that Redacted’s cast and crew of diverse queer women are saving the universe, it’s another step forward for representation. “Doctor Who has always appealed to LGBTQ+ people,” says Dawson. “There’s something so enduring about the idea that, if you’re living a slightly humdrum life, this person in a blue box can whisk you away for an adventure in time and space. Many of the Doctor’s sidekicks have been downtrodden or marginalised, even if they weren’t outwardly queer. So to take that subtext and make it text, that means a lot. We don’t need to make it a metaphor any more. We can have three queer women front and centre.” Doctor Who: Redacted is available on BBC Sounds, with new episodes each Sunday.",Arts/Television & radio,"‘Very gay, very trans’: the incredible Doctor Who spin-off that’s breathing new life into the franchise",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/29/doctor-who-redacted-transgender-podcast
4/30/2022,"You can sort of tell what kind of film writer-director-co-star Savvas D Michael thought he was making, given the lofty references to Homer’s Iliad in the plotting, Martin Scorsese movies in the dialogue, and Guy Ritchie in the casting – given the presence here of Vinnie Jones in a cameo role. However, the result is an intensely irritating hot mess, a London petty criminal story set in the Greek Cypriot community that’s offensive, self-indulgent and stupid. The title refers to a private club of the same name, run by one Plato Andinos (Andreas Karras), a small-time big shot who likes to throw parties with strippers for his mates, and preaches homophobia and sexism at home to his kids. His wife, Helen (Marina Sirtis, from Star Trek Generations) puts up with it all because she gets knockoff designer handbags and a tacky house that makes the cribs in The Only Way Is Essex look like items from Architectural Digest. But Plato’s home life is only peripheral to the story, which mostly revolves around the exploits and hijinks of him and his crew, a motley selection of knaves, one of whom is a supposedly handsome and supposedly unbeatable scrapper named Achilles (played by Michael himself). Stung when his romantic overtures are rejected by local beauty-cum-poker-hustler Lola (Lois Brabin-Platt, whose display of sass represents one of the film’s few amusements), Achilles goes into a sulk in Homeric fashion. This causes considerable distress in particular to Achilles’ No 1 fan, Anthony (Jamie Crew), seemingly also expected to be considered an object of pity given Crew’s manic and mannered display of verbal diarrhoea, delivered with a speech impediment and jerky movements. Perhaps Anthony is the character for whom we’re supposed to feel sorry. That said, hardly anyone is even vaguely likable here, which needn’t necessarily have been a drawback, but they should at least be in some way interesting. No such luck.

4/30/2022,"West Ham have said two supporters face indefinite bans if they are found to have attacked two German radio reporters during their side’s 2-1 home defeat by Eintracht Frankfurt in the semi-final of the Europa League on Thursday night. The club have identified “two offenders” after Tim Brockmeier and Philipp Hofmeister, who were covering the game for German radio station ARD, were allegedly jumped on by home fans when Michail Antonio equalised for West Ham. Hofmeister said on air that Brockmeier’s headset had been ripped off and thrown to the floor, and there were allegations that punches were thrown at the reporters. West Ham launched an investigation after the game and have passed the two supporters’ details to the Metropolitan Police. A club spokesman said: “‘Following a thorough internal investigation since the full-time whistle last night, West Ham United can confirm two offenders have been identified. “As well as continuing our own investigation, in line with our zero-tolerance approach, the offenders details have also been passed onto the police, who will now conduct their own investigation. If the offenders are found guilty, they will be given an indefinite ban and not be permitted to enter London Stadium, nor travel with the Club. Behaviour of this kind is unacceptable and will not be tolerated at West Ham United.” Hofmeister told listeners during the live broadcast: “We are being attacked here. They threw the headset down on my colleague Tim. I have to sort myself out a bit. We have to see that we can get some security personnel here.” The two commentators were moved to another position at half-time. Hofmeister also said during the broadcast: “You constantly have the feeling that something could come from behind, a punch or something. My dreams of English football have been shattered.” A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police said: “We are aware of reports that during the match, two radio journalists were assaulted by fans seated behind them. Such behaviour is unacceptable and has no place in football stadiums. “We have a close working relationship with all London clubs and we welcome the statement issued by West Ham about this incident. Our officers will be working with the club in the coming days to determine what took place and to identify anyone involved so that appropriate action can be taken.” David Moyes, whose side face an uphill battle to reach the Europa League final when they travel to Germany for Thursday’s second leg, condemned the incident. “I’m disappointed,” West Ham’s manager said. “But the club have acted on it right away. It’s not good.” Moyes will assess Kurt Zouma before deciding whether to start the defender at home to Arsenal on Sunday. Zouma returned from an ankle injury to face Eintracht and West Ham will not want to risk his fitness.",Sport/Football,West Ham identify fans in alleged attack on German radio reporters,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/29/west-ham-identify-two-supporters-who-attacked-german-radio-reporters

4/30/2022,"Donald Trump’s administration overrode Covid-19 guidance to religious organizations, according to newly released emails, which would have encouraged churches to consider virtual religious services rather than in-person worship. In May 2020, as coronavirus cases and deaths surged, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent the White House a draft of its planned guidance to faith-based communities, seeking approval for publication. At the time coronavirus cases were increasingly being reported in churches across the US. Cases would continue to soar in places of worship in the following months. In response, the CDC planned to suggest that religious communities restrict in-person attendance at services, and instead hold them online. When that guidance arrived at the White House, however, it prompted discussions which ended up with key passages being struck out. In an email exchange with Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to Trump, Paul Ray, the administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, suggested a series of edits. “The new CDC draft includes a significant amount of new content, much of which seems to raise religious liberty concerns. In the attached, I have proposed several passages for deletion to address those concerns,” Ray wrote. “If these edits are acceptable to you all, we could tell CDC, as early in the morning as possible, that they are free to publish contingent on striking the offensive passages.” In her reply, Conway thanked Ray for “holding firm against the newest round of mission creep”. In another email chain, Trump officials expressed dissatisfaction with CDC recommendations – which had already been posted online – which suggested that faith communities should consider holding services online. May Davis, a legal advisor to Trump, wrote to Paul and other officials that “problematic guidance is still online”. Davis attached suggested edits to the CDC guidance, which she said “removes all of the tele-church suggestions”. Davis added: “Though personally I will say that if I was old and vulnerable (I do feel old and vulnerable), drive through services would sound welcome.” Representative James Clyburn, chairman of the select subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis, which released the emails, said in a statement that the Trump administration had “prioritized politics over public health”. “As today’s new evidence also makes clear, Trump White House officials worked under the direction of the former president to purposefully undercut public health officials’ recommendations and muzzle their ability to communicate clearly to the American public,” Clyburn wrote. On Friday Gene Dodaro, head of the Government Accountability Office, is due to testify before Congress about a GAO report which found staff at the CDC and other public health agencies witnessed “political interference” during the response to the pandemic.",News/US news,"Trump White House overrode Covid guidance for churches, emails show",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/29/trump-white-house-cdc-church-guidance-emails
4/30/2022,"Sir Jim Ratcliffe has made a bid to buy Chelsea, two weeks after the deadline for offers. His move came as Steve Pagliuca was told his consortium had been eliminated from the running. Ratcliffe, the owner of the British petrochemicals company Ineos, told the Times: “We put an offer in this morning. We are the only British bid. Our motives are simply to try and create a very fine club in London. We have no profit motive because we make our money in other ways.” Pagliuca’s consortium was one of three that had been in the contention to buy Chelsea, who are owned by Roman Abramovich. It leaves two other consortiums with US involvement potentially still in the race: one is led by the co-owner of the LA Dodgers, Todd Boehly; the other is fronted by Sir Martin Broughton and Sebastian Coe – both of whom are British – and has received backing from the owners of the Philadelphia 76ers basketball team, Josh Harris and David Blitzer. The merits of each offer are being assessed by Abramovich and Chelsea’s board, and Raine, the American bank handling the sale, will take a preferred bidder to the UK government for approval. Ineos said in a statement: “Sir Jim Ratcliffe, chairman of Ineos, has made a formal bid for Chelsea FC, for £4.25bn. £2.5bn is committed to the Charitable Trust to support victims of the war, with £1.75bn committed to investment directly into the club over the next 10 years. This is a British bid, for a British club.” It said there would be investment in Stamford Bridge and in the men’s and women’s first teams and the academy. “We believe that London should have a club that reflects the stature of the city,” it said. “One that is held in the same regard as Real Madrid, Barcelona or Bayern Munich. We intend Chelsea to be that club.”",Sport/Football,Chelsea sale: Ratcliffe makes 11th-hour bid as Pagliuca told he is out of running,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/29/chelsea-sir-jim-ratcliffe-bid-to-buy-club-abramovich
