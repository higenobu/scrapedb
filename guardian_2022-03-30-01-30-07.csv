3/30/2022,"The prospect of Tiger Woods making an incredible comeback at the Masters next week has increased after the 15-time major winner arrived on Tuesday at Augusta National for a practice round. He has not played competitive golf since incurring serious leg injuries in a car crash in February last year. Woods is expected to assess his physical capability to play in the first men’s major of 2022 after playing 18 holes, with a decision likely before the end of this week. The reaction of Woods’s body to walking Augusta’s hilly terrain will be key. As Woods’s private jet touched down in Georgia on Tuesday morning, bookmakers immediately slashed his odds of claiming what would be a sixth Green Jacket. Woods, who won the Masters of 2019 after returning from multiple back surgeries, was regarded as highly unlikely to play competitively before this year’s Open Championship at St Andrews, at the earliest. He featured alongside his son, Charlie, at the PNC Championship in December but with the assistance of a golf cart. A month earlier, he admitted he was “lucky to be alive” after the crash in Los Angeles while adding: “Now I’m able to participate in the sport of golf. To what level? I do not know that.” Images have surfaced in recent days of Woods playing at the Medalist club in Florida, fuelling speculation of an unlikely Masters return. While he is the master of creating mystery, the fact that the 46-year-old is willing to visit Augusta at this juncture means he regards the possibility of playing in the 86th edition of the Masters as a serious one.",Sport/Sport,Tiger Woods fuels unlikely Masters tilt with Augusta practice round,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/29/tiger-woods-fuels-unlikely-masters-tilt-with-augusta-practice-round
3/30/2022,"Where is Mick Jagger right now? “I’m in Frahhhnce where it’s rather grey,” drawls the 78-year-old singer with exaggerated languor. “I can’t even in my wildest imagination call it spring-like.” Even down a crackling phone line, the voice is hypnotically rich: the dense delicious timbre, the sudden leaps between high and low notes. Then there are those vowels. Maroon 5 had a hit in 2010 singing about his moves, but no one does vowels quite like Jagger. That much is clear from Strange Game, the grungy theme song he has recorded for the six-part adaptation of Mick Herron’s acerbic spy novel Slow Horses. The series concerns a team of disgraced spooks relegated to an insalubrious office tucked behind the Barbican. Jagger sneers at these rejects on the song, branding them “losers, misfits and boozers” before announcing: “You’re finished, you’re foolish, you faiiiled.” Their boss is a bitter, flatulent old bully played by Gary Oldman. “It’s slightly written from his point of view,” the singer explains. “I figured I’d make it kind of about him and his frustrations with his crew. You know, ‘Surrounded by losers’ blah-blah-blah. But I also tried to make the point that they all want to redeem themselves. They have this ambition to do good somehow, and to prove they’re not worthless.” Strange Game was written remotely by Jagger and the composer Daniel Pemberton, who still haven’t met in person. “What’s incredible is how much Mick conveys and distils the mood of the book,” says Pemberton. “That’s hard to do but he hit it out of the park straight away. We were expecting to get a cool song that might not have any relevance to the story but he instantly sets up that whole world. From a sonic point of view, he has this amazing mastery over his voice. Inflections that seem off-the-cuff are all highly controlled. It’s like working with a precious material that’s in limited supply.” The squalid mood of the lo-fi production is enhanced by Jagger’s camp, taunting delivery: swaggering one minute, whispery the next. “Daniel liked it wordy,” he recalls. “But I said, ‘You can’t just have me saying loads and loads of words’, so I put in a few ‘ooh-ooh’s and things to give it that slightly eerie atmosphere.” I start to ask if I can take him back half a century to another specially written composition of his, but he interrupts before I can finish the question: “Please don’t,” he says, a theatrical tremor in his voice. Then he continues in a tone of mock-outrage: “Half a century? Half a century to what?” To his song Memo from Turner, that writhing electric eel of a number which he belts out midway through the 1970 film Performance – the cult favourite in which Jagger is a debauched rock star holed up in his Notting Hill pad with a gangster played by James Fox. How did writing Strange Game compare to that? “Weeeell,” he says, stringing the word out in such a way as to suggest he considers the inquiry rather spurious. “That was a song which slotted inside of a movie so it’s not really comparable. Insofar as it relates to the story, I suppose it’s got some vague similarity but it’s not the same kind of gig at all.” How does he feel now about his performance in Performance? “Blimey, it’s so long ago I can’t remember! It was quite a lot of hard work and I’d never done a film before, so I was really learning and didn’t know what I was doing. I had to be quite concentrated on getting it right. It’s a strange movie in some ways. But in certain ways it holds up.” Perhaps modesty forbids him from calling it a masterpiece, which it surely is, or from recognising that it brings intact to the screen his most wickedly feral qualities. Having followed Performance with an eccentric turn as the notorious Australian outlaw in Ned Kelly, Jagger expressed the desire to be a “character actor”. He hoots at the idea now. “Did I say that? The thing is that in those days, you didn’t get many offers. It’s much easier today for people in music to get film parts. There used to be a lot of prejudice against people in the music business – it was like they could only do that one thing, and it was just stunt casting really that you were offered.” Do actors and singers tend to share a skill-set? “There are similarities and crossovers. You do have to project and become someone else but they are completely different disciplines. What little acting I’ve done, I’ve always enjoyed. But just because you’re on stage entertaining 50,000 people, it doesn’t follow necessarily that you’re going to be a very good actor.”Yet he is. The director Sean Mathias discovered as much when he cast Jagger alongside Clive Owen and Ian McKellen in his 1997 film of Bent, Martin Sherman’s play about the persecution of gay men under nazism. Jagger has a small role as Greta, who croons Philip Glass’s Streets of Berlin while sitting atop a trapeze in a black sheer gown, curly wig and drop earrings. If stealing a movie were a crime, he would have got life without parole. “Performance is the reason I thought of Mick for Greta,” says Mathias. “It’s his presence, isn’t it? The beauty, the androgyny. He’s so strange-looking, so sexual and beautiful. A bit of an animal. He’s got the face of a much older person but the skinny body of a teenager. He has that enviable metabolism. He was still with Jerry Hall at the time, and he told me: ‘Jerry wants to kill me. I can eat whatever I like, whereas she only has to look at a chip and she puts on weight.’” Mathias remembers Jagger as “a collaborative company member. He had an entourage but never abused his power. He’s got an amazing brain. He’s interested in a huge array of subjects, and can talk about all of them. And he’s tremendous fun at dinner – he’s got a really camp sense of humour.” Delays during one of the film’s night shoots pushed Jagger’s scenes back into the early hours of the morning. “I had to go to his caravan and say, ‘Mick, I’m sorry but we’re running late.’ It was about four in the morning, he looked quite old and tired, and he stared at himself in the mirror and said: ‘Oh look at that face. It’s wretched. You can’t shoot me now!’ I remember saying, ‘Oh Mick, you look absolutely fantastic.’ I thought, ‘I’m such a phoney!’ Because he did look very tired. But I knew if I gave into his ego, I’d be sunk and I’d never get him on set.” Given that he acts so rarely, what sort of role is likely to appeal? “One that sparks something in you,” says Jagger. “If it makes you think: ‘I can take this character and bring him to life. I can make him interesting or amusing.’ You don’t wanna be playing yourself, or too close to yourself. I’ve turned that down.” He never had the movie career that his friend David Bowie did. Then again, he wasn’t the solo entity that Bowie was: he had the old ball-and-chain to carry around, or the Rolling Stones as they’re known. In the mid-1990s, Jagger hatched the idea of a comedy concert movie that would intersperse live footage of the band with scripted scenes showing two devoted Stones fans, to be played by Brad Pitt and Ben Stiller, clambering to see their idols at any cost. Jagger brought Stiller and Judd Apatow in to pitch the film at a band meeting. In Apatow’s telling, Keith Richards was the stumbling block. Whenever Ronnie Wood expressed enthusiasm for making the film, said Apatow, Richards would shoot him down: “And ’oo are you, Alfred ’itchcock?” Around five years ago, Jagger let it be known within the industry that he was looking for a “last” movie outing. He got his wish with the small but memorable role of a millionaire art collector with a sinister agenda in The Burnt Orange Heresy, a sly, slippery thriller shot on Lake Como. How did it feel to be acting again? “Er, well it was a bit odd to be honest,” says Jagger. “I hadn’t done any for ages. I was like: ‘Oh. Um. Yes. Acting. Let’s think now. How do we do this?’ I once asked Jack Nicholson, ‘When you build a character, where do you start?’ He said, ‘His sex life.’” He gives an amused little snort. Mapping out the background of a character has usually helped. “It may not necessarily fit with the script but it’s good to have. Otherwise you’re just saying the lines. And you don’t wanna just say the lines. Well, you can, but it’s better if you know what sort of person he is. I made notes about whether the guy was married, what his schooling was like. Was he a crook? Did he like rugby? The usual stuff. It’s all quite funny but if you’re going to do a job, you might as well do it properly.” The film’s director Giuseppe Capotondi can attest to that. “Mick really did his homework,” he tells me. “He said, ‘Maybe the character should speak with a Chelsea accent but from the days before Chelsea became posh, back when it was still working class.’ That all came from him. He also spoke to a few of his gallerist friends to understand how the market works.” One scene, in which Jagger flips from affable to intimidating in the space of a single line, suggests that he would have been a natural at Pinter. “That’s very good, isn’t it?” agrees Capotondi. “He managed to change tone there, all while sitting down and smoking his electronic cigarette. He’s very effective. Mick can convey emotions without doing much. Most of his acting is done with his voice rather than his face. It can be giggly then very deep. He uses it as an instrument and that’s a plus for any actor.” What sort of presence was he on set? “He was very humble, maybe because he felt a bit out of his depth. Before we started, he said, ‘I give my best in the afternoon. Can I do all my scenes then?’ I told him: ‘Mick, we only have four days with you! We can’t only shoot in the afternoon!’ I watched him getting off his boat and coming to the villa at seven in the morning, and he looked a bit grumpy. But the moment he reached the set he was perfect.” Did he talk about this being his final role? “He was saying, ‘I’m getting older. I don’t have much time.’” How does it feel to have directed possibly the last ever Jagger film? “Oh God, that’s a big responsibility,” he laughs. “I hope he does another one. I’m sure he will. He’s just busy with the day job.” Indeed, tickets have just gone on sale for the Rolling Stones’ 60th anniversary European tour, which begins in June; seven weeks in, Jagger will turn 79. “We’re working on the new stage, which I hope is gonna look nice,” he says. “I’m looking forward to touring Europe and speaking lots of different languages, even though I don’t know what I’m talking about. We’re just working out which songs we’re gonna do. It doesn’t seem very long since we finished doing the US so I’m up for it and ready for it.” He and Richards have even been working on new material. “Yeah, we’ve been doing some banging around. It’s been fun.” What he might consider “banging around”, others would put in more exalted terms. Pemberton is among them. Asked how he feels to have written a song with Mick Jagger, he says: “It’s like I convinced Picasso to come round and paint my front room.” Slow Horses is on Apple TV+ from Friday.",Arts/Music,Mick Jagger on acting: ‘Jack Nicholson told me to start with a character’s sex life’,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/29/mick-jagger-acting-jack-nicholson-sex-slow-horses-performance-bent-dragged-ned-kelly
3/30/2022,"Police responding to one of Canada’s worst mass shootings nearly shot the wrong man, officers have said during a public inquiry examining the attack and authorities’ chaotic response. Testifying on Monday at a public inquiry into the 2020 attack in the town of Portapique, Nova Scotia, which left 22 dead, three Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers said the scene resembled a “war zone” and that they were unprepared for the number of casualties. At one stage, amid the sound of gunfire and with thick smoke pouring from burning houses, they pursued a man fleeing into the forest. But the man was not the perpetrator, Gabriel Wortman. Instead, the officers were mistakenly pursing Clinton Ellison, who had just discovered the body of his brother, Corrie Ellison, lying dead on the road. The pair had been in Portapique visiting their father and had ventured outside after hearing a gunshot. “We were getting ready to shoot him,” said constable Stuart Beselt. “If he would’ve ran, we would’ve shot him … I’m very thankful I didn’t shoot.” Fearing he was being stalked by the shooter, Ellison turned off his flashlight and hid in the woods for hours. The officers soon pulled back, fearing they could themselves be targeted by the shooter. “It would be suicide,” said Beselt. “It was self-preservation at that point.” Officers did not learn until two days later that Ellison was not the gunman. The statements from constables Beselt, Adam Merchant and Aaron Patton mark the first time key witnesses have testified under oath at the province’s mass casualty commission. Wortman’s 13-hour rampage on 18-19 April 2020 ended when he was shot dead by police. But questions over the emergency response have persisted – not least why the RCMP leadership failed to issue an emergency alert, warning residents of the gunman. The union representing the officers initially said testifying would re-traumatize them, but police agreed to answer questions from the commission after mounting public pressure for answers into the early hours of the response. The three officers said they initially assumed the shooter was driving a decommissioned vehicle, possible with old decals, after receiving reports that a “police car” was spotted in the area. Instead, they soon realized he was in a near-perfect replica of their own vehicles, equipped with emergency lights. Beselt said if they had encountered the replica cruiser at night, they would have hesitated to open fire on the killer, not knowing if they were shooting at a colleague. “We would have been shot,” Beselt said. “There’s no doubt he would have gotten the jump on us.” Patton said one of the most difficult decisions that night was leaving four children, whose parents had been killed, in a basement as they searched for the shooter. Officers told them to lock the doors and hide until police returned. “That was the single hardest decision we made that night,” he said. “We were worried non-stop after leaving the house that something was going to happen to those kids.” The commission will continue on Wednesday, with a timeline of the gunman’s actions early on 19 April, as well as testimony from a civilian witness.",News/World news,Police at Canada mass shooting nearly fired on wrong man in chaotic response,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/canada-mass-shooting-police-portapique-nearly-shot-wrong-man
3/30/2022,"Hong Kong hospital authorities have made a U-turn to allow parents of Covid-positive children to accompany them in paediatric wards, regardless of their own Covid status, as the city’s “fifth wave” of the virus eases. Many toddlers were hospitalised during the Omicron-fuelled outbreak, which peaked this month, government data showed. But until recent days, only parents who also tested positive were allowed to remain in the same ward as their children. Up to 2,000 children under the age of 10 had been separated from their parents over the past five to six weeks after being admitted to hospital, according to a local charity that accused the government of “child abuse”. The policy also caused outrage among parents and campaigners. “We have hardly seen any parent allowed to be admitted into hospital with their infected children,” Dr Lucy Lord, the executive chair of mental health charity Mind Hong Kong, told local media. “This is unacceptable. This is child abuse on any level.” But on Tuesday the city’s Hospital Authority told the Guardian the policy had been reversed. “Even for parents or carers who are tested negative for Covid‐19, we will seek the agreement of the Centre for Health Protection, so that the public hospitals can also accommodate their request for accompanying the paediatric patient, subject to availability of isolation capacities,” it said. The authority added that children in a stable condition could rest at home, and if parents or carers were also confirmed as having the virus and wished to take care of their children, the hospital would arrange for them to stay in the same ward. Hong Kong-based foreign consulates including the US and Australia had raised concerns over the isolation policy. The US government on 2 March advised against travelling to Hong Kong, citing Covid restrictions, “including the risk of parents and children being separated”. On Monday, the Hospital Authority defended its previous policy. Dr Sara Ho Yuen-ha, the chief manager for patient safety and risk management, said it “needed to strike a balance between [serving] the needs of the sick children admitted and arranging to have them accompanied”. Ho blamed the controversial practice on the fifth wave and said it had spread very quickly and many sick children needed to be hospitalised. Local media reported that two children aged under three and six children under 12 had died after contracting Covid during theoutbreak. On Tuesday, Hong Kong confirmed 7,596 new coronavirus cases – a fourth consecutive day of decline in numbers. But experts warned that figure was likely to increase in the coming weeks. Prof David Hui Shu-cheong, the government’s pandemic adviser, said: “[The daily figure of] about 7,000 to 8,000 is still at a high level. What we are worried most about now is there will be the Ching Ming festival and Easter holidays [in April]. If there are more public gatherings, we are worried there will be a rebound [in infections].”",News/World news,Hong Kong hospitals will no longer separate Covid-infected children from parents,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/hong-kong-hospitals-separate-covid-children-parents-u-turn-china
3/30/2022,"For his debut solo exhibition in Los Angeles, London-based artist Alvaro Barrington hosted an all-day barbecue in the Blum & Poe gallery parking lot and invited Ghostface Killah to perform. From the pop-up stage, the Wu-Tang Clan scion looked out on the crowd and bashfully called it “mixed”; there were adult Ghostface fans as well their children, plus moneyed art collectors who had come to buy new, very in-demand work. What ensued was, in modern parlance, iconic – a half-hour singalong of Wu-Tang hits, with bonus tracks commemorating the late Biz Markie and Marvin Gaye. There were even product samples of Killah Bee, Ghostface Killah’s gold-speckled, cannabis-infused brownies. The opening was uplifting, in every sense of the word. “The show wouldn’t have been complete without Ghost,” Barrington said. His exhibition, 91–98 jfk–lax border, on view at Blum & Poe through 30 April, is an acutely personal look back at the 90s through hip-hop, an unvarnished record of an era ripe for closer examination. In 1990, when Barrington was eight years old, he left his home in tropical Grenada. He and his mother moved to Flatbush, Brooklyn, the West Indian enclave of a much larger, concrete island. With the same approach as recording an album, he organized his show to include features – that is, guest appearances – by other artists who resonate with elements of the community: Teresa Farrell, Aya Brown, Paul Anthony Smith, Jasmine Thomas-Girvan, and his teenage cousin, Ariel Cumberbatch. The wall-mounted sculpture by Thomas-Girvan bears “a kind of magic realism that is so deeply Caribbean”, Barrington says, in its sinuous assemblage of wood, costume feathers, and strands of brass curled to resemble plumes of smoke. He compares her work to a trumpet solo that Olu Dara, Nas’s father, played on a track of the Illmatic album: “It’s reaching down to the roots, but it’s also reaching to the heavens. It gets you to this place of serenity.” Brown’s portraits of Missy Elliott, Lauryn Hill, and Li’l Kim, rendered in soft pastel on brown kraft paper, had reminded him both of a specifically New York style of drawing, and the way punk rock had influenced the work of Elizabeth Peyton. “In music, you understand the role of a feature; it’s kind of the antithesis of painting, where we think of the painter as an individual genius,” Barrington says. “But Aya looks at these women in a way that I can’t represent myself. The lesson I learned from hip-hop is that it makes more sense for her to speak in her own voice.” In his own works, Barrington chose materials that would evoke the textures of his childhood, assembling basketballs and milk crates, rebar and cement, into homages of two of the greats, 2Pac and DMX. “I see Pac and X as a continuation of each other; they both tell the story of the war on drugs as a war against working-class black communities,” the artist says. “When politicians were calling young Black men newly released from prison super-predators, X was talking about what being locked in a hole would mean for a 14-year-old’s mental health.” Homages to DMX bookend the exhibition, beginning with two floating monuments mounted to the gallery walls. Cut-out images of the rapper, microphone in hand, are encased in cement boxes that Barrington inscribed with lyrics while the cement was still wet: The two years in a box, revenge, the plots/ The 23 hours that’s locked, the 1 hour that’s not/ The silence, the dark… Those 23 hours reverberate into a separate gallery space, where, in contrast to the colors and textures of the show as a whole, a row of cold steel frames line the perimeter of completely white walls. Within each frame, a cardboard panel cut with the digits of a quartz alarm clock bears a time, from 00 to 23h00. They amount to a day in solitary confinement the way that DMX had described – a prolonged, silent procession of hours. In both nostalgic and mournful turns, this is a show about history, both public and private, and who counts as a reliable narrator. Looking back at the 90s, Barrington describes the decade as a “fundamental shift in the American imagination”, where neoliberalism’s veneer of prosperity glossed over increasingly punitive measures against communities of color. He recalls Bill Clinton charming Black audiences on Arsenio Hall, while simultaneously vilifying the so-called “inner city” and its “superpredators” in a campaign of fear. Former mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani, meanwhile, was crediting aggressive law and order policies as having “cleaned up” the city: “There was a rising media culture that used Black people as an excuse to cut whatever social program they wanted to cut, and enforce whatever kind of policing they wanted to enforce.” In contrast to the denigrating media narratives, Barrington’s community swaddled him in affirmation. At a young age, he found his truth: “I grew up in places where the majority of people looked like me, and everything in my life to that point reinforced my dignity, and my sense of self.” When his mother died in 1993, the artist was looked after by a network of aunties, and found solace in his cousins’ music. It was the golden age of hip-hop, a new, intimate era of storytelling that aligned with the events of his life. “There was a one-to-one in terms of what Ghost was saying and what I was going through,” Barrington says, referencing the lyrics to All I Got Is You. “There are lines about ‘15 of us in a three-bedroom apartment’, and there were eight of us in a one-bedroom apartment. His mama passed away, and my mama passed away.” The song ends with lines about looking up at the stars and looking forward to tomorrow. “If I didn’t have that song,” the artist says, “I would’ve had to find another way to cope with the situation I was in.” History, Barrington has found, has had a longstanding habit of erasing the contributions of Black culture. He offers up the fact that Matisse had spent time in Harlem, cultivating relationships with black jazz musicians. “He was trying to paint jazz,” he says, both its rhythms and spontaneity. “You go to art school, and you never hear that.” In 91–98 jfk–lax border, hip-hop fills holes in the historical record, recounting a contentious decade as Barrington remembers it. His recurring use of cement adds a sense of weight and permanence to stories that have been subjected to erasure. “Through making, I’m putting out ideas of what I think I know,” he says. “I might be right, I might be wrong.” He’s also adamant about his work always being accessible, and reaffirming his community: “It’s important that my family don’t feel dumb because they don’t know who Rothko is.” Foregoing the traditional gallery dinner, Barrington opted instead to throw a small concert by one of his all-time favorite artists. (Blum & Poe co-founder Tim Blum says that he first heard that Ghostface would be performing at his gallery on Instagram: “You’ve really got to stick along for the ride with Alvaro”.) Writing his own press release, the artist described the exhibition as “my thank-you to some of my heroes … Biggie, JAY-Z, and Lil’ Kim gave us the commandments to get fly and carry our heads high ... [Ghostface] made us want to ground our souls and reach for the skies.” And where the 90s were filled with conflicting accounts, “The only real narrative was that we saved each other.” 91–98 jfk–lax border is showing at Blum & Poe in Los Angeles until 30 April",Arts/Art and design,‘We saved each other’: Alvaro Barrington’s 90s hip-hop exhibition,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/29/alvaro-barrington-90s-hip-hop-exhibition
3/30/2022,"Earlier this month, the foreign affairs committee held an evidence session into the use of strategic lawsuits against public participation (Slapps). Catherine Belton amended references to Roman Abramovich in her book Putin’s People after he sued her and her publisher for defamation. She had described the aggressive tactics often used by some British legal firms. Tom Burgis, author of Kleptopia – who recently had a libel case against him brought by the Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) thrown out by a judge – said, of the way some London law firms behave: “You are cast as the most monstrous, scheming, corrupt version of yourself.” Slapps are one of those things that nobody used to talk about, but suddenly everyone wants to talk about. In January, David Davis and Liam Byrne spoke in the Commons of the various ways journalists have been put on mute by litigation from big-money players. Byrne, on poetic form, said the journalists’ dictum of “follow the money … is now being smothered, suffocated and strangled in courts by allies, associates and friends of President Putin”. Defamation is one of four areas of law that the wealthy typically use against investigative journalists. The others are privacy, data protection and – comically – harassment. It is very hurtful to a billionaire’s feelings when people bang on and on about where their money came from, and which of their enemies mysteriously died. (Just this weekend we’ve read about how England’s legal system can have a chilling effect on journalism in the Sunday Times’ remarkable piece on the disgraced former MP Charlie Elphicke.) Suing a troublesome journalist can be a win-win for those with deep pockets. If you go after the publisher alone, they may be tempted to settle out of court: the expense of fighting a case to trial is a powerful deterrent. If you go after the individual alone, you can effectively silence them for the duration of the case; in victory, you can silence and probably bankrupt them; even in defeat, all you’ve lost is a fraction of your vast, inexhaustible wealth. An expensive lawsuit can leave an author isolated, as all those who would naturally publicly support them are themselves terrified of getting sued. Yet even knowing all that, there is a side dish to the legal proceedings that has, until now, also silenced civil society: relentless ad hominem attacks and insinuations that the writer is a bad, discredited person. These tend to come from commentators, keyboard warriors and social media users, both named and anonymous. The best-known victim of such a smear campaign – in which legal action can encourage an avalanche of social media slurs, which are then picked up by mainstream commentators – is the Observer journalist Carole Cadwalladr, who is being sued for defamation by Arron Banks. Unesco did a forensic analysis of the “networked gaslighting” she has received online, examining more than 2m English-language tweets about her; it found that 55% of all the abuse was personal, “highly gendered and designed to hold her up to ridicule, humiliate, belittle and discredit”. A similar piece of work was undertaken by the International Center for Journalists about Maria Ressa, the Nobel peace prizewinning Filipino-American founder of a news site in Manila, and its findings were near identical – though with additional racism. We often get mired in questions about how many of these online abusers are real people, and how many are bots, particularly given the very similar wording across screeds of output. The much more important issue is the migration of the abuse from insular online spaces to the wider public sphere, which is what makes the discrediting effective. Certainly, when broadcasters such as Andrew Neil repeat tropes like “mad cat woman”, that has a powerful impact, amplifying and legitimising abuse that previously sounded totally unhinged. But the role of the bystander – which is to say, all of us – is equally important and more complicated. Most people can see a conflict and have a good instinctive read on who’s David and who’s Goliath, but don’t have time for a deep dive on matters that are technical and opaque. A charge by one side that the other is mad operates like a dispensation; there is no David or Goliath: only a crazy person howling at nothing. You no longer have to trouble yourself about who’s telling the truth, you can just spectate as it all plays out. Surely time will tell which is the rational actor? Misogyny, which always seems so baggy and old-hat as a concept, is actually a state-of-the-art precision tool in the battle between investigative journalists and campaigners, and the forces of corruption. It is quite difficult to make the case, without evidence, that any given individual is mad – yet it’s much easier, almost too easy, to make it land if that individual is female. It’s not new – “A little bit nutty and a little bit slutty” was the famous smear used to discredit the US lawyer Anita Hill when she made a harassment claim in the 1990s. What is new is that it has been systematised, invested in and networked, so that any woman investigating anything should expect doubts to be raised about her sanity. In the immediate term, we need better general inoculation; or to put that another way, if someone tells you a woman is mad, just don’t buy it.
