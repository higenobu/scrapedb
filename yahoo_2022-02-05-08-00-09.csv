2/5/2022,"By Nancy Lapid (Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review. Alzheimer's-like changes seen in COVID-19 patients' brains People who die of severe COVID-19 have brain abnormalities that resemble changes seen in Alzheimer's disease - accumulation of a protein called tau inside brain cells, and abnormal amounts of the protein beta-amyloid that accumulates into amyloid plaques - small studies have found. At Columbia University, Dr. Andrew Marks and colleagues studied the brains of 10 COVID-19 patients and found defects in proteins called ryanodine receptors that control the passage of calcium into cells. In Alzheimer's disease, defective ryanodine receptors are linked to accumulation of tau into so-called neurofibrillary tangles. These tangles were present in high levels in the COVID-19 patients' brains, the Columbia team reported on Thursday in Alzheimer's & Dementia. Other research teams have looked for - and found - abnormal amyloid levels in brains of COVID-19 patients, according to reports posted online ahead of peer review on bioRxiv and on The Lancet's preprint server. In all the studies, patients had experienced the most severe forms of COVID-19. If similar changes are occurring in the brains of patients with milder illness, that might help explain the ""brain fog"" associated with long COVID, Marks said. Patients with severe COVID-19 might be at higher risk for dementia later in life, but it is too soon to know, he added. His advice: Get a booster vaccine and avoid the virus. ""If you get COVID-19, you probably won't die, but we still don't know a lot about the long-term effects."" Seniors can get flu shot, mRNA COVID-19 booster together Seniors can safely get the high-dose flu vaccine and an mRNA COVID-19 booster dose at the same time, a new study confirms. The study's 306 participants, all older than 65, were randomly assigned either to receive Sanofi's Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent influenza vaccine and a third shot of Moderna's mRNA vaccine at the same time, or either of the vaccines alone. Blood samples obtained before and 21 days after vaccination showed that giving the two vaccines together did not affect the resulting immune response, with similar antibody levels generated in participants in each of the three groups, according to a report published on Tuesday in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine. A spokesperson for Sanofi said combined administration of the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines ""did not raise any safety concerns and the study team is continuing to follow study participants through 6 months after vaccination."" Fluid in some rapid COVID tests could be deadly for kids In some COVID-19 rapid test kits, the small bottle of ""reagent"" fluid contains sodium azide, a powerful poison that is particularly dangerous for small children, experts warn. In adults, small amounts can quickly cause dangerously low blood pressure, dizziness, fainting, or even heart attacks or strokes, said Dr. Kelly Johnson-Arbor, Co-Medical Director of the National Capital Poison Center in Washington, D.C. Higher doses can be fatal, she and her colleagues wrote in The American Journal of Emergency Medicine. Sodium azide levels in COVID-19 rapid test kits are not always high enough to cause low blood pressure in adults, and the iHealth kits being sent out by the U.S. government do not contain any sodium azide at all, Johnson-Arbor said. ""However... since children are typically much smaller than adults, they are at a higher risk of experiencing poisonous effects after swallowing any amount,"" she said. Poison control hotlines have been getting reports of accidental exposures to the reagent fluid. ""Some people have swallowed the solution, some have spilled it onto their skin, and others have put it in their eyes,"" mistaking the bottle for eye drops, Johnson-Arbor said. ""If you or a loved one swallows the reagent fluid or gets the fluid in their eyes or on the skin, contact Poison Control right away.""

2/5/2022,"Bezos' new 417-foot megayacht is being built near Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Dutch media reported that a 100-year-old bridge would be dismantled so Bezos' yacht can leave port. The Rotterdam mayor said there's been no application yet, but Bezos would likely have to pay to dismantle it. The mayor of Rotterdam denied reports that the Dutch city was dismantling a historic bridge to make way for Jeff Bezos' new superyacht to pass. Dutch media reported Wednesday that a section of the nearly 100-year-old Koningshaven Bridge would be removed to allow Bezos' new 417-foot yacht to reach the ocean. The existence of the megayacht, Y721, which is being constructed in the nearby city of Alblasserda, was first reported by the journalist Brad Stone last May. Stone reported that the yacht was costing the Amazon founder $500 million to build. However, Ahmed Aboutaleb, the major of Rotterdam, said Thursday that no decision had been made to dismantle the bridge and, if it happens, that Bezos or his shipbuilder Oceanco may need to foot the bill. ""No decision has yet been taken, not even an application for a permit,"" Aboutaleb said Thursday, the Algemeen Dagblad reported. Aboutaleb said it doesn't matter that the world's second-richest man is involved. ""That has absolutely nothing to do with this decision. It's about the facts. I want to know them first,"" he said, according to the paper. The first images of what is thought to be Bezos' megayacht surfaced in October, showing it had three masts that wouldn't fit under the 131-foot clearance afforded by the bridge. Frances van Heijst, a spokesperson for the municipality of Rotterdam, previously told Insider that the city is able to grant permission to the maritime sector to take a ship to sea. But van Heijst told The Washington Post that Oceanco would have to pay for the cost of dissembling the bridge if permission is granted. Oceanco and Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider. According to Stone, Bezos has also commissioned a smaller ""support yacht"" from Oceanco. Both boats are due for completion in 2022, Boat International reported. A Facebook group calling on Rotterdam residents to hurl rotten eggs at Bezos boat as it passes through the city has garnered hundreds of positive responses, BN DeStem reported.

2/5/2022,"Former Vice President Mike Pence on Friday directly rebutted Donald Trump's false claims that Pence somehow could have overturned the results of the 2020 election, saying that the former president was simply “wrong.” In a speech to a gathering of the conservative Federalist Society in Florida, Pence addressed Trump's intensifying efforts this week to advance the false narrative that, as vice president, he had the unilateral power to prevent Joe Biden from taking office. “President Trump is wrong,” Pence said. “I had no right to overturn the election.” While Pence has previously defended his actions on Jan. 6 and said that he and Trump will likely never see “eye to eye” on what happened that day, the remarks Friday marked his most forceful rebuttal of Trump to date. And they come as Pence has been laying the groundwork for a potential run for president in 2024, which could put him in direct competition with his former boss, who has also been teasing a comeback run. Trump this week had escalated his attacks against Pence. In a statement Tuesday, Trump had said the committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol should instead probe “why Mike Pence did not send back the votes for recertification or approval.” And on Sunday, he blasted Pence, falsely declaring that “he could have overturned the Election!” Vice presidents play only a ceremonial role in the the counting of Electoral College votes, and any attempt to interfere in the count would have represented an extraordinary violation of the law and an assault on the democratic process. Pence, in his remarks Friday to the group of lawyers in Lake Buena Vista, described Jan. 6, 2021 as “a dark day in the history of the United States Capitol"" and framed his actions that day as in line with his duty as a constitutional conservative. “The American people must know that we will always keep our oath to the Constitution, even when it would be politically expedient to do otherwise,” he told the group Friday. He noted that, under Article II Section One of the Constitution, “elections are conducted at the state level, not by the Congress” and that “the only role of Congress with respect to the Electoral College is to open and count votes submitted and certified by the states. No more, no less.” He went on to call out those who have insisted that isn't the case. “Frankly there is no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president,” he added. “Under the Constitution, I had no right to change the outcome of our election. And Kamala Harris will have no right to overturn the election when we beat them in 2024.” The audience applauded Pence's line about beating the Democrats in the upcoming presidential election, but remained silent when Pence said earlier that “Trump is wrong.” Pence was inside the Capitol on Jan. 6, presiding over the joint session of Congress to certify the presidential election, when a mob of Trump’s supporters violently smashed inside, assaulting police officers and hunting down lawmakers. Pence, who released a letter moments before the session got underway that made clear he had no authority to overturn the will of the voters, was rushed to safety as some rioters chanted “Hang Mike Pence!” The former vice president, in his remarks Friday, acknowledged the lingering anger among many in Trump’s base, even as he said it was time “to focus on the future.” “The truth is, there’s more at stake than our party or political fortunes,"" he said. ""Men and women, if we lose faith in the Constitution, we won’t just lose elections — we’ll lose our country.” Trump aides did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the speech. But Trump released a statement shortly after that slammed the Jan. 6 committee but notably made no mention of Pence. Trump’s escalating rhetoric comes as he has been under growing scrutiny from the committee, which has now interviewed hundreds of witnesses, issued dozens of subpoenas and obtained reams of government documents that Trump tried to keep hidden. It also comes as a bipartisan group of lawmakers has been pushing to update the Electoral Count Act to eliminate any ambiguity about the vice president’s role. Pence has so far tried to thread a needle on his actions Jan. 6, which continue to enrage large portions of Trump’s base, posing a potential complication if he runs for president in 2024. In recent months, he has generally refrained from voluntarily raising the events of that day but has defended his actions when pressed, saying he was abiding by his constitutional role. Last year, he said in a speech that he will “always be proud that we did our part on that tragic day to reconvene the Congress and fulfilled our duty under the Constitution and the laws of the United States.” He has also accused Democrats and the media of continuing to focus on the insurrection to score political points against Republicans and divert attention from Biden’s agenda. While a basic declaration of fact, Pence’s decision to describe Trump as “wrong” was especially significant given Pence’s posture in the White House. As Trump’s vice president, Pence was exceptionally deferential to him, never publicly voicing disagreement and defending even his most controversial actions. After spending several months laying low after leaving the White House, Pence has returned to the public spotlight. He launched his own political advocacy group and has been traveling the country, visiting early voting states, delivering speeches and hosting fundraisers for midterm candidates. Pence, unlike some possible 2024 presidential contenders, has notably declined to rule out running against Trump. He is also working on a book. Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the chair of the Jan. 6 committee, and Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California have both said they plan to call Pence to testify as part of their investigation. It is so far unclear what Pence will do.",Politics/Associated Press,Pence: Trump is 'wrong' to say election could be overturned,https://news.yahoo.com/pence-says-trump-wrong-saying-204453145.html
