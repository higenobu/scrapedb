3/8/2022,"Frank Lampard blamed individual errors rather than tactical disarray or poor attitude for Everton’s 5-0 thrashing by Tottenham after another miserable away performance from a side that last celebrated a league victory outside Goodison Park in August. In their last home game Everton restricted Manchester City to a close-fought and contentious 1-0 win, but in their last two away matches they have not produced a single shot on goal. In a one-sided match in north London they allowed Harry Kane to score twice while Son Heung-min, Sergio Reguilón and an own goal from Michael Keane completed a miserable evening. “It’s night and day,” Lampard said. “Really good last week – discipline, gameplan, work ethic. And we started the game well today. The first 15 minutes looked like I wanted it to, but the crucial part of Tottenham’s game as a counterattacking team is to find space behind you and the players were aware of that and didn’t deal with it. If you’re going to do that you make your own problems. “The main issues were mistakes and bad defending for the goals. It wasn’t just the defensive situations – at the top end of the pitch we didn’t show enough. Even when we were in relative control we didn’t threaten their backline. There’s a clear discrepancy in home and away form, issues that were there before me and don’t take care of themselves overnight. But rather than being about home and away, if you make those mistakes you’re going to struggle. It’s important to remain positive but we can’t shy away from the mistakes we made tonight.” Tottenham now go into Saturday’s game at Manchester United on a high, and knowing that victory would take them above their opponents in the hotly contested chase for the final Champions League place. “It was an important performance tonight, a really good performance,” Antonio Conte said. “We scored five goals, we create chances to improve the final result, and I have seen that when we have more time to prepare, to play against us is difficult for everybody. “From tomorrow we have to start to think about Saturday, a crucial game for us. I put this target to my team – we have to try to stay until the end, very close to the top teams. From my arrival to now we are stronger, and I think that we can fight for this target. It’s important to have this ambition. To finish in the top four for us would be like we won the Champions League, like we won the Premier League this season.”",Sport/Football,Frank Lampard blames individual errors for Everton’s rout by Tottenham,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/08/frank-lampard-blames-individual-errors-for-evertons-rout-by-tottenham
3/8/2022,"An unsung heroine who helped save the lives of hundreds of scholars seeking refuge from Nazi-occupied Europe is to be celebrated with a blue plaque in her home city of Leeds. Esther Simpson was, from 1933, the assistant secretary to a charitable British organisation called the Academic Assistance Council (AAC). At first glance it does not sound like the most important job in the world. But because of Simpson, it was momentous. “It is no exaggeration to say that without Esther’s work … the way the world has changed, it would have changed in a different way,” said Martin Hamilton, the director of Leeds Civic Trust, which is responsible for the plaque. It is being unveiled on Tuesday at the opening of a new building at the University of Leeds named in her honour. She joins more than 180 people and places celebrated with a plaque in the city over the last 35 years. Simpson was born in Leeds and studied modern languages at the university. She was not the head of the charity, but she was the one who did the work. “She was the engine behind the whole thing,” said Hamilton. “She was responsible for dealing with all the applications for people to go to safety and she made the decisions. Esther Simpson was making life or death decisions every day of the week, working very long hours.” Simpson said the work she did was the academic equivalent of the kindertransport programme. Among the hundreds of people she helped save were leading academics who achieved the highest honours, including 16 Nobel prize winners. Known as “Esther’s children”, they included the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner and the philosopher Karl Popper. Another was Ludwig Guttman, a neurologist who established the Stoke Mandeville Games, the forerunner of the Paralympics. Hamilton wonders whether the Paralympics would have become the major event they are today without Esther Simpson. “There are lots of things like that, and then you’ve got to think of the children of the people she saved as well. When you think of the impact she had, you’re talking thousands of people,” he said. Other academics she helped relocate to Britain were the historian Victor Ehrenberg, the father of Tudor historian Geoffrey Elton and physicist and educationalist Lewis Elton, father of the comedian Ben Elton. Another is the grandfather of Stephen Reicher, a psychologist who is a member of the Sage subcommittee advising on behavioural science. Reicher said he would not be here without the AAC and Esther Simpson. “That is why support for Scholars at Risk is so important to me and why, right now we need to build support through Cara – the successor to the AAC – for our colleagues around the world, in Syria, in Afghanistan and of course in Ukraine, and not forgetting those brave Russian colleagues who have come out to condemn Putin’s war,” he said. Another example of unsung women being belatedly honoured took place at the Royal Oldham hospital on Monday. A plaque was unveiled celebrating the achievements of two nurses who played pivotal roles in the birth of the first IVF baby, Louise Brown. Sister Muriel Harris and Jean Purdy, a nurse embryologist, did not have their names engraved on the original plaque more than 40 years ago and Monday’s event was about correcting “this historic injustice”.",News/World news,Unsung heroine who saved refugees from Nazis honoured in Leeds,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/unsung-heroine-who-saved-refugees-from-nazis-honoured-in-leeds
3/8/2022,"UK household incomes are on course to collapse by the most since the mid-1970s after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices soaring to new highs, a thinktank has said. The Resolution Foundation said the dramatic increase in global oil and gas prices was forecast to push UK inflation above 8% this spring, causing average incomes across Britain to fall by 4% in the coming financial year – a hit worth £1,000 per household, the biggest annual decline since 1975. Warning the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, that urgent steps were required to help the poorest families in Britain with soaring living costs, the thinktank said weak wage growth and high inflation were expected to drive more children into poverty. Inflation in the UK was already at 5.5% – the highest rate for 30 years – before Vladimir Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine. Now economists are warning that the conflict’s impact on global oil and gas prices will add to inflationary pressures around the world. Although the UK sources relatively little of its gas supply from Russia – about 5% of its total imports – fears over supply restrictions amid the escalating conflict have driven up global wholesale prices. Oil prices surged to $139 a barrel on Monday before falling back to about $125. UK gas prices rose to 800p a therm before falling to about 600p – still almost triple the price at the start of February. The Resolution Foundation said UK inflation could therefore peak at 8.3% this spring, or even exceed the 8.4% rate of April 1991, which was the highest level for the measure of the increasing cost of living since 1982. It said the damage for household incomes would have been bigger without the £350 boost provided by the government’s energy support package announced last month. Without taking this into account, analysts at the Bank of America last week had forecast the biggest drop in living standards since at least 1956. The warning comes as the government prepares to increase the value of working-age benefits and the state pension by 3.1% from April. Over the course of this year, the Resolution Foundation estimated this would mean a real-terms cut in the value of benefits of more than £10bn. The thinktank said Sunak needed to take evasive action to protect households from the squeeze. Adam Corlett, the principal economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: “The immediate priority should be for the chancellor to revisit benefits uprating in his upcoming spring statement.” The chancellor has come under increasing pressure in recent days to use his mini-budget to address the economic impact of the conflict at home and abroad, including from backbench Conservatives urging a rise in defence spending and trade unions calling for more humanitarian aid for Ukraine and support for UK workers. Tom Keatinge, the director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies at the Royal United Services Institute, told MPs on the Treasury committee on Monday that Sunak needed to provide an urgent update. “I would like to hear from the chancellor about how is he thinking about the impact of sanctions on the UK economy. It’s clearly a massive issue for the UK. So it would be good to hear how are the thoughts around dealing with cost of living crisis. How is that being thought through? I think communicating that soon would be important,” he said. Retail industry bosses are warning that the squeeze on living standards would hit consumer spending this year, weighing down the UK’s economic recovery from Covid-19. The British Retail Consortium said on Tuesday total sales rose in February by 6.7% compared with the same month a year earlier, and by 4.9% compared with the same month in 2020 before the pandemic struck, as shoppers returned to the high street after the government relaxed Covid restrictions introduced during the Omicron wave. However, Helen Dickinson, the chief executive of the consortium, said sales would soon come under pressure. “The future is looking increasingly uncertain, with current demand unlikely to be sustained,” she said. “The cost of living will continue to spiral due to global inflation, increasing energy bills and the rise in national insurance this spring. With households facing lower disposable income, discretionary spend will be one of the first things to feel the squeeze.” A Government spokesperson said: “We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, which is why we’re providing support worth around £20 billion this financial year and next to help.”",News/Business,"UK household incomes facing biggest decline since mid-70s, says thinktank",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/08/uk-household-incomes-decline-resolution-foundation-ukraine-conflict-energy-prices
3/8/2022,"Conservative drug reformers and leading psychiatrists are urging ministers to reclassify the psychedelic compound psilocybin so that researchers can explore its potential as a medicine. The same demand is being made by people suffering from cluster headaches – which involve severe pain that existing drugs do little to relieve – amid evidence that psilocybin can help reduce both the condition’s physical and mental impact. Psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, is currently a schedule one drug – the most tightly controlled – under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Campaigners want it downgraded to schedule two to facilitate more studies into its efficacy as a treatment for cluster headaches. Three world-renowned British psychiatrists have written to Sajid Javid, the health secretary, and Kit Malthouse, the crime and policing minister at the Home Office, urging a rethink. Prof Allan Young, Prof Karl Friston and Prof Simon Wessely want the ministers to commission Sir Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, “to assess the evidence for the harms and utility of psilocybin with a view to rescheduling this promising medicine and experimentally useful compound at the earliest opportunity”. Wessely has advised the government on mental health policy and led an independent review, commissioned by then prime minister Theresa May, into the Mental Health Act. A recent study yielded “impressive results” showing that psilocybin can help reduce the symptoms of treatment-resistant depression, they say. The compound is also being investigated for its potential benefits for those with anorexia, obesity and post-traumatic stress disorder as well as alcohol, cocaine and tobacco addiction, they add. “There has been no recent review of the evidence for psilocybin’s current scheduling [and] there is not and never has been an evidential basis for psilocybin’s current scheduling.” They argue that the Home Office’s refusal to downgrade the compound “is inconsistent with the precedent set by cannabis-based products for medicinal use in 2018”, they said. Ainslie Course, a director of the cluster headaches charity ClusterBusters UK, and 160 other people with the debilitating condition have also written to Javid and Malthouse seeking a relaxation. “The brutality and severity of the pain … wreaks havoc on relationships, family life, employment and friendships. Our condition carries a suicide rate 20 times the national average,” she writes. Most sufferers are breaking the law by buying the drug online to medicate themselves, she adds. The bid to get psilocybin reclassified is supported by the Conservative Drug Policy Reform Group, whose members include Tory MP Crispin Blunt, an ex-justice minister. Boris Johnson agreed to reschedule psilocybin and other psychedelic substances in order to allow research into them in a meeting with him last May, Blunt said. However, nothing has changed in the 10 months since. Blunt said: “Cluster headache sufferers hold guns to their heads routinely as they weather attacks of this ill-understood condition. Those who do know about it know all too well the pain that causes these to be known as ‘suicide headaches’. “To keep in place the red tape that precludes further clinical knowledge of how this pain can be alleviated with psilocybin is to cement thousands in the UK between a rock and a hard place. Do they break the law to access a medicine that seems to work, or do they accept that the Home Office has consigned them to a life of suffering further preventable attacks?” A government spokesperson said: “We sympathise with the often-debilitating pain faced by people who suffer from cluster headaches. “Medicines involving controlled drugs must go through a licensing process to ensure their safety, quality and efficacy. No medicine based on psilocybin has yet been licensed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. “However, we are working with the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs to consider whether barriers to legitimate research on controlled drugs – including psilocybin – could be removed.”",News/Science,Demand grows for UK ministers to reclassify psilocybin for medical research,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/08/demand-grows-for-uk-ministers-to-reclassify-psilocybin-for-medical-research
3/8/2022,"The prospect of medical therapies that rewind the clock on the ageing process has edged a little closer after scientists safely rejuvenated tissues in middle-aged mice. Researchers in the US treated healthy animals with a form of gene therapy that refreshed older cells, making the animals more youthful according to biological markers that are used to measure the effects of ageing. Repeating the trick in humans is far from straightforward, but the findings will fuel interest in radical new therapies that aim to slow or reverse the ageing process as a means of tackling age-related diseases such as cancer, brittle bones and Alzheimer’s. “A host of age-related diseases might benefit from this approach,” said Heinrich Jasper, a principal fellow and director at the US biotech firm Genentech. If the approach can be shown to combat certain health problems, “it would constitute a new therapeutic approach with a significant impact on unmet medical needs at all stages of our life”, he added. The scientists drew on previous work by the Japanese Nobel laureate Prof Shinya Yamanaka, who showed that a mixture of four molecules – known as Yamanaka factors – can rewind adult cells into youthful stem cells that are capable of forming almost any tissue in the body. Writing in the journal Nature Aging, the US team led by Jasper and Prof Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte at the Salk Institute in California and the San Diego Altos Institute, found that mice who received Yamanaka factors for several months resembled younger animals in many ways, with their skin and kidneys in particular showing signs of rejuvenation. The experiments showed that rejuvenation was more effective when the therapy was given for a long time – seven to 10 months – starting when the animals were 12 to 15 months old, equivalent to age 35 to 50 in humans. When older animals, equivalent to 80 years old in human terms, were treated for one month, the scientists saw little impact. Researchers are cautious about using Yamanaka factors in humans because previous work has shown that fully reprogrammed cells can turn into clumps of cancerous tissue called teratomas. The latest study shows that partial reprogramming may be able to rejuvenate tissues without such risks, but further hurdles remain. Rather than using Yamanaka factors to rejuvenate aged humans, many scientists suspect that new drugs will be needed to partially reprogram cells safely and effectively. “Will this ever find application in humans?” said Dr Tamir Chandra, an expert in the biology of ageing at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the study. “In theory, biological age reversal or reduction could be possible. However, we are at very early stages where we need to understand the basic science behind it much better. “Using Yamanaka factors bears the risk of inducing cancer, and unlike mice, humans – due to their lifespan – carry many more mutations at older age, which might already be predisposed to developing into a cancer. “Research groups are working on timing, dosage and combinations of Yamanaka factors to minimise this risk. “Now that we know that loss of cell identity and age reversal can be distinct in their trajectories, other groups are trying to find new factors that uncouple the loss of cell identity from the rejuvenation effects. “The first applications will likely be in tissue that is easily accessible and can be modified outside the body, like blood stem cells.”",News/Science,Ageing reversal: scientists rejuvenate tissues in middle-aged mice,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/07/ageing-reversal-scientists-rejuvenate-tissues-in-middle-aged-mice
3/8/2022,"The Canadian city of Edmonton may soon be hogtied with a problem that it won’t be able to barbecue its way out of. Wild pigs have been spreading across central Alberta’s prairies and if left unchecked, could soon find themselves in the river valley of Edmonton. According to Ryan Brook, a University of Saskatchewan professor studying the pigs, the creatures are an “ecological trainwreck” and would cause “absolute destruction” if they make their way to the river valley, which is abundant in water and forest cover. “They tear up the forest floor, native grasslands get destroyed, wetlands, water systems. They feed on anything where they can, and will kill any pets, for sure,” Brook told the Edmonton Journal. “Wild pigs are the worst invasive wild mammal on the planet – I don’t think there’s any debate about that.” As omnivores, the pigs will eat virtually anything, including squirrels, birds, eggs, roadkill, live deer and pets. Weighing up to 100kg, the pigs sustain blistering winters by building “pigloos”, or burrows that they heap with cattail plants. “They wallow in wetlands and tear them up to make their nests … They contaminate water with mud and pathogens, they destroy crops, they are a public safety hazard and they can transmit disease to humans, pets, livestock and wildlife,” Brook said. The pigs can severely jeopardize the livelihood of native wildlife. In addition to competing with native species such as deer and wild turkey, the pigs often beat coyotes to the scene of a kill. They can also carry 89 diseases including the African swine fever. Another illness, foot and mouth disease, has been estimated by the Alberta Invasive Species Council to cost upwards of $51b in national exports if it spreads to meat products and causes an outbreak. In addition, wild pigs have been linked to the decline of 22 plant species and four amphibian species. Last May, the Alberta Invasive Species Council launched the Squeal on Pigs campaign in an attempt to control the pigs’ spread. The campaign urges residents to report wild pig sightings to authorities so they “can make plans to eliminate entire sounders [a group of wild pigs] at once”. The campaign comes after researchers found that hunting individual pigs was only making the problem worse as it gave the rest of the pigs a chance to change their habits. Despite the provincial government’s campaign, Edmonton officials do not have a plan to deal with the pigs, should they begin invading the city, according to a city spokesperson, Chrystal Coleman. “You can ignore wild pigs all you want until you can’t ignore them. Then they’re at your doorstep and literally showing up in your house and coming into cities,” he said. “You cannot dabble in wild pig eradication. You either go in full hog and go hard and remove them, but you need a strategy,” warned Brook. According to Mike Bodenchuk, a biologist at the US Department of Agriculture, the pigs are able to adapt to urban environments. They have been found sleeping under car shades, knocking over headstones in city cemeteries and eating pet food. The pigs also scavenge through trash which exposes garbage and in turn attracts birds, thus creating issues for nearby airports and seaports. “It’s hard to imagine you can damage trash, but you can … if we don’t cover it deep enough, the pigs will dig it and eat that trash and it opens up to birds coming in,” Bodenchuk told the Edmonton Journal. “You cannot barbecue your way out of this problem,” he added.",News/World news,Canada’s wild pigs threaten ‘absolute destruction’ if left unchecked,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/wild-pigs-feared-absolute-destruction-canada
3/8/2022,"The US supreme court has rejected requests from Republicans in North Carolina and Pennsylvania to overturn electoral maps imposed by the state supreme court in both places that make elections more competitive. The justices ruled 6-3 on Monday not to block the new North Carolina maps from going into effect, with justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Clarence Thomas saying they would have paused the state supreme court’s ruling. In the Pennsylvania case, there were no noted dissents from the court’s decision. That case will now go to a panel of three federal judges and Republicans can appeal a ruling from whatever they decide to the US supreme court in the future. Both decisions are a win for Democrats politically, as well as voting rights groups that have turned to state supreme courts recently to try and police partisan gerrymandering. The US supreme court said in 2019 that federal courts could not police partisan gerrymandering, but said state constitutions could. In North Carolina, the state supreme court struck a congressional map that would have likely given Republicans an advantage in 10 of the state’s 14 congressional districts, in a state that is extremely competitive. The map was so egregiously distorted towards Republicans that it ran afoul of a provision in the state constitution that guarantees free elections. After Republicans failed to produce a fairer map, the supreme court replaced it with a plan that gave the GOP a 7-6 advantage with one highly competitive seat. Republicans wanted the US supreme court to block that map, arguing that the US constitution explicitly gives state legislatures the power to set the “time, manner, and place of elections”. By drawing new districts, they argued, the state supreme court have overstepped its authority. Embracing such an argument, experts warned, would emboldened state legislatures to enact new restrictive voting measures with little oversight. The court issued its decision on an emergency basis and did not explain its reasoning. Writing a separate concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said it was too close to the state’s primary to impose new maps, but said the case “advanced serious arguments on the merits” and that the court should hear it with full briefing an argument. “Today’s move by the court reinforces that legislatures do not have a ‘free pass’ to violate protections against partisan gerrymandering when drawing districts that undeniably hurt voters. North Carolinians can now expect to vote in elections under fair congressional maps free of back-door dealings, extreme partisanship, and racial discrimination,” said Hilary Harris Klein, senior counsel for voting rights at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, which represented some of the challengers in the North Carolina case. Even though the court declined to step in on Monday, there are signs it may be willing to in the future. In a dissent joined by Gorsuch and Thomas, Alito signaled a willingness to limit the power of state supreme courts when it comes to policing partisan gerrymandering and the authority of a legislature to set election rules. “If the language of the elections clause is taken seriously, there must be some limit on the authority of state courts to countermand actions taken by state legislatures when they are prescribing rules for the conduct of federal elections. I think it is likely that the applicants would succeed in showing that the North Carolina supreme court exceeded those limits.” In Pennsylvania, the state supreme court picked a new congressional map after the state’s Republican legislature and Democratic governor were unable to agree on a plan. The plan gives Republicans an 8-6 advantage and gives the state three highly competitive districts, according to 538. Republicans similarly argued that the state supreme court overstepped its authority, but the supreme court rejected the argument. “This case has now been referred to a three-judge court, and the parties may exercise their right to appeal from an order of that court granting or denying interlocutory injunctive relief,” the justices wrote. Wisconsin Republicans are also appealing a ruling from the state supreme court setting new electoral districts. That case remains pending before the court.",News/US news,Blow to Republicans as supreme court denies bid to overturn electoral maps,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/07/us-supreme-court-republicans-north-carolina-pennsylvania
