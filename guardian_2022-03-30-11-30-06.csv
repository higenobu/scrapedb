3/30/2022,"Liberal MP Andrew Laming said he would refuse to pay back travel expenses after a scathing report from the independent parliamentary watchdog found he wrongly billed taxpayers more than $8,000 and at times “obfuscated, provided inconsistent answers or ignored [questions]” during its investigation. The Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority began investigating Laming’s claims for travel expenses in June 2020 after Guardian Australia’s series on MPs’ travel expense claims. The audit examined Laming’s travel in a single month and found he had wrongly claimed 21 expenses – all relating to his or his family’s travel between Hobart, Melbourne and Brisbane in June 2019 – totalling $8,288.04 and told him to pay back $10,360, including a 25% loading. Ipea’s finding will now trigger a payment recovery process, and parliamentarians generally either repay excess payments in full or offset it against future claims. Late on Tuesday, Laming told the Guardian he disputed “every syllable” of the report and described the investigation as a “baseless and subjective witch-hunt”. “Ipea’s finding that the travel was not ‘parliamentary enough’ is false,” he said. “For this reason I categorically reject the report’s conclusions and view the process as a ‘witch-hunt’. “I won’t be repaying legitimate parliamentary travel, and no MP ever should.” Asked whether that meant he would not be paying back the expenses that were the subject of Ipea’s report, he said: “Yes, clearly.” The audit focused largely on two trips Laming billed to taxpayers. The first was a three-day trip from Brisbane to Hobart with his partner and two children, beginning 21 June 2019, during which Laming claimed thousands of dollars worth of flights, travel allowance, hire car costs and Cabcharges. Laming said the trip was mainly needed so he could attend the combined meeting of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists (RANZCO) and the Australia and New Zealand Society of Ophthalmic Plastic Surgeons (ANZSOPS). The Ipea investigation said organisers were “unaware of his intention to attend until shortly before the conference commenced”. It found Laming had “no formal invitation” and spoke with organisers at “the last minute”, and that the organisers made a slot for him to speak in the morning tea break. “We came to know about Mr Laming’s plan to attend the conference quite close to the actual meeting and we made a slot for him to speak on Sunday the 23rd of June,” the organisers told Ipea. Expenses can only be claimed for trips where the main purpose is parliamentary business. Ipea found the speech was not enough for the dominant purpose of the three-day trip to be parliamentary business. “While this [speech] may satisfy the definition of parliamentary business, it fails the dominant purpose test when examined within the context of Mr Laming’s activities, and use of business resources, over a three-day period,” the authority found. Laming disputes the last-minute nature of his invitation, telling the Guardian he “was invited, confirmed and registered [on] June 12”. Ipea also examined a separate trip from Brisbane to Melbourne on 26 June, for the flagship annual conference for the Australian horticulture industry, Hort Connections, during which the MP claimed more than $4,000 in flights, travel allowance, and Cabcharges. . The report said that “IPEA understands his spouse attended in her own right and for the entirety of the Hort Connections conference”. Laming billed taxpayers for her return travel home to Brisbane from the conference, and his own travel to and from Melbourne. He initially told Ipea he went to the conference to develop a proposal for a “food hub” in Birkdale, Brisbane, in his electorate. “I was invited by a sponsor to attend the congress to advance the food hub project,” he told them. Ipea’s investigation found he had not arrived until 9.49pm on the last day of the conference. By Laming’s own evidence, the authority said, he was only at the event for “the final hour of the dinner that concluded the conference”. When asked about his late arrival, Laming told Ipea: “The parliamentary grounds for travel to Melbourne was to attend the conclusion of the Gala dinner where all relevant stakeholders would be assembled. This was by arrangement with a Queensland sponsor at a time when formal award presentations had concluded that evening.” Ipea asked for the name of the Queensland sponsor and evidence of the invitation. Laming initially said the sponsor was “no longer employed with the organisation nor able to correspond on that matter”, but, after being pressed, told Ipea he received an informal invitation from “a Queensland AusVeg representative”. Later, Laming provided an “unverified” email to Ipea from a “CEO and part-time employee of Mr Laming”, who advised that it was in fact him who suggested the MP attend the conference. The email says: “Mr Laming was not a delegate to the conference but took the opportunity to attend as a visitor. I introduced him to a couple of my table guests at the dinner and he then independently worked the room.” Ipea said Laming did not respond to requests to provide the names of anyone he engaged with on the evening of 26 June 2019. It found Laming did not travel for the dominant purpose of parliamentary business, meaning “the travel of his spouse from Melbourne to Brisbane” was also not consistent with the legislative provisions for family reunion expenses. Ipea was damning in its assessment of Laming’s approach to the investigation. “In general, and specifically in relation to the audit report, Mr Laming’s responses have been deficient in content and detail,” it said. “Further, in a number of instances where Ipea posed specific questions to Mr Laming he obfuscated, provided inconsistent answers or ignored the question altogether.” Laming told the Guardian that Ipea had “cherry-picked” the evidence to arrive at an adverse finding. He said the investigation had confirmed he travelled to address a national conference in Hobart, attend an industry gala dinner in Melbourne and meet with independent educators. “Ipea’s finding that the travel was not ‘parliamentary enough’ is false. For this reason I categorically reject the report’s conclusions and view the process as a ‘witch-hunt.’”",News/Australia news,"Liberal MP Andrew Laming will refuse to repay travel expenses after audit finds $8,000 in invalid claims",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/30/liberal-mp-andrew-laming-will-refuse-to-repay-travel-expenses-after-audit-finds-8000-in-invalid-claims
3/30/2022,"Changes designed to make paid parental leave more flexible have been labelled a “step backwards for gender equality” by experts as they create a disincentive for fathers to share caring responsibilities. Tuesday’s budget revealed that the existing 18 weeks of paid primary carer leave and two weeks of “dad and partner pay” will be combined into an entitlement to 20 weeks of paid leave that can be divided between parents as they choose. At a cost of $346.1m over five years, the parental leave measure means single parents get an extra two weeks of leave and expands eligibility to high income households earning up to $350,000. While the change allows fathers and partners to take more parental leave, the president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Michele O’Neil, said she doubted that would happen unless it was accompanied with an increase in the rate of paid leave. “Despite the government saying either parent could share the leave … Actually, that’s a disincentive because the majority of women are on lower wages than men,” O’Neil said. “It doesn’t fix the problem. Although on the surface, it looks like more men will participate in having paid leave – because of the low rate of [women’s] pay, that’s not going to come about. “Look around the world – the best paid parental leave schemes are paid at a higher rate [than the minimum wage] and have an incentive for men to share in the care of children. There’s no incentive in this at all.” Dr Leonora Risse, an economics lecturer from RMIT University and the national chair of the Women in Economics Network, said the paid parental leave flexibility was “a step backwards for gender equality”. “International research clearly shows that removing the leave allowance earmarked for fathers results in mothers taking more leave, with little response from fathers,” Risse said in a statement. “This policy change will have the effect of further entrenching traditional gender roles in Australian households. “Extending the amount of use-it-or-lose-it paid parental leave for fathers would have been more effective in supporting more men to be a part of their children’s upbringing and more women to extend their workforce participation.” The Australian Council of Social Services welcomed the extension of 20 weeks paid leave to single parents, which chief executive Cassandra Goldie said was “long overdue”. Others criticised the failure to boost paid parental leave by adding superannuation to the payment. Eva Scheerlinck, chief executive of the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, said it was “disappointing the government has failed to [introduce] super on paid parental leave”. Women account for more than 90% of parental leave taken by primary carers, contributing to the fact they retire with 40% less superannuation, she said. Scheerlinck said paying super on paid parental leave “would allow parents to continue building their retirement savings while taking time out of the paid workforce to care for children and family”. Labor has signalled it is unlikely to oppose paid parental leave flexibility. The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, told ABC Radio on Tuesday that “on the surface, it looks OK to us” but he wanted to consult colleagues to “make sure that it’s getting maximum value for money and also doing the right thing by Australian mums and dads”. Amanda Rishworth, the shadow minister for early childhood education and development, said she was “all for more flexibility when it comes to families”. “But ultimately, the government’s tried to get a headline without giving any extra paid weeks to families,” she said on Wednesday. The paid parental leave changes are set to take effect “no later than 1 March 2023”, according to the women’s budget statement.",News/Australia news,"Federal budget 2022: fathers unlikely to take more paid parental leave despite changes, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/30/federal-budget-2022-fathers-unlikely-to-take-more-paid-parental-leave-despite-changes-experts-say
3/30/2022,"Emergency services have responded to criticism of the response to this week’s flooding in Lismore, Byron Bay and Ballina, with the SES acting commissioner Daniel Austin admitting some things would have been done differently “if we had a crystal ball”. An evacuation order for the Lismore CBD was removed late on Tuesday afternoon, only to be reinstated at 3am on Wednesday after more heavy rain overnight. The local flood siren also did not sound when the levee was breached because it malfunctioned. At a press conference about the unfolding flood situation, the acting NSW premier, Paul Toole, said “no one could have predicted some of the amounts of rainfall that we have seen land”. “If you look at Alstonville, in the last 24 hours, we’ve seen 430mm of rain land in these communities. Four weeks ago, these communities were impacted by heavy rainfall in that area. No one could have predicted they would be back here again.” SES head Austin said the decision to drop the evacuation order at Lismore was taken based on local consultation and advice from the Bureau of Meteorology about the incoming weather. “At that point in time, that advice was the right advice to enable the community to try to restore and work through its recovery process,” Austin said. “Some hours later, we then saw a significant thunderstorm form over the Lismore area, which led to that extreme flash flooding event. The community reacted well through the evening.” Austin said the situation developed “exceptionally quickly”. “If we had a crystal ball, then you may make different decisions,” he said. “You make your decisions based on the information that you have at the time.” He pointed out the SES had been warning residents that information was subject to change at short notice. BoM meteorologist Dean Narramore said it was getting harder to predict these flooding events, noting work was being done to improve modelling. He warned anyone who lived near rivers, creeks and streams in the northern rivers area to stay vigilant. “Please stay up to date with the latest forecasts and warnings and listen to all advice from emergency services because, as we saw last night, these coastal troughs and small-scale low pressure systems are always rapidly evolving and quickly changing weather systems,” he said. Byron Bay experienced flash flooding overnight, with the main street inundated, and local federal MP Justine Elliot questioned why there was no evacuation centre set up by early Wednesday morning. “Our staff are responding to situations as fast as they can but many have been impacted by the weather as well,” a spokesperson for the Byron council said. “Please avoid flooded areas around the Byron Bay CBD. It’s not the time to be going for a drive to have a look at things.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Toole said resourcing of the SES would be one of the matters considered as part of the independent inquiry announced following the devastating floods a month ago. “That inquiry itself, I am sure, is going to outline a number of changes and things that may need to happen as we go forward,” Toole said. “We can always look at doing things better and I want to make the commitment that we always should.” The emergency services minister, Steph Cooke, said the inquiry would also look at “planning matters”. Toole warned residents that more flooding was possible in coming weeks, with more wet weather predicted throughout April.",News/Australia news,‘No one could have predicted’: authorities defend Lismore flood response after evacuation order was cancelled,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/30/no-one-could-have-predicted-authorities-defend-lismore-flood-response-after-evacuation-order-was-cancelled
3/30/2022,"Last night I was woken at midnight by my dog Hugo having a panic attack from the thunder, nothing out of the ordinary – only an annoying hindrance to sleep. Then the wind and rain which has been steady for months began building into an extreme weather event – with the house shaking and trees bending almost over on to themselves. Within an hour, our bedroom started to leak and out came buckets and towels. Our normally stationary creek had trees floating past us, ripped from the banks by the wind. At 2am the flood waters – already at an uncomfortably high level for the past two days – strove for new heights. People holding their phones for light were at their shops trying to stop water coming in with sandbags, in a futile effort. At 3am town was submerged and resignation set in. As high tide came, the water continued to rise, hitting its peak early in the morning. People driving through the flood waters in town for fun caused waves that further damaged the stores and businesses. I cannot remember sunshine. It has been raining steadily since spring. If you have been fortunate enough to not lose your home, business and personal belongings, as so many have, then at the very least you have mould all over your possessions, your income affected and are grappling with the seasonal depression. Here in Byron Bay we survived last month’s flooding, which would once have been considered severe but is now a “new normal” to us. Merely four weeks later we are under water again, with a new level of disaster reached. My girlfriend’s Fletcher Street clothing store, Enzo & Toto, is ruined, the hundreds of hours she spent preparing and labelling stock gone, along with hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of carefully chosen clothing. The shop is filled with muddy brown water, dishevelled mannequins protruding from the chaos. The entire town is under water up to your waist at some points, with police now stopping people from entering. The severity of the wind during the night was that of a mini-cyclone blowing with caprice in every direction. In just two years the northern rivers has suffered multiple record-breaking floods and a fire season never experienced before, as well as coronavirus lockdowns that brought this tourist town to its knees. Growing up here you are used to flooding – you build your homes up high or elevated on poles. But this is something else – a disaster that never ends. We first heard first these events were once in 100 years, then once in 500 years and then in 1,000 years. This is climate change manifest: we were warned, and our government did nothing. After this there will be droughts and all the associated chaos – the loss of life and damage that high temperatures and dry bush bring. This is a microcosm of the impending doom humanity will face. Heed our warning, we must change our habits and policy – though it may already be too late.

3/30/2022,"Rex Patrick has used parliamentary privilege to blast his former boss Nick Xenophon, declaring working for Huawei at this point in history is akin to someone “choosing to do PR work for the German companies Krupp or Messerschmitt in 1938”. Xenophon, the high profile former senator who confirmed last week he will run again as a Senate candidate in the upcoming federal election, has worked as strategic counsel for the Chinese telco, which was banned from Australia’s 5G contract on national security grounds. Xenophon’s decision to run again for the Senate is problematic for Patrick, who has to contest the coming election in South Australia with lower name recognition than his former boss and one-time running mate. Xenophon hit back at Patrick on Wednesday morning. He told Guardian Australia: “It is unbecoming of Rex Patrick to reference the lead-up to the Holocaust in a miserable attempt to dredge up some votes.” In a Senate adjournment debate on budget night, Patrick declared Xenophon needed to be “completely transparent about his dealings with the Chinese telecommunications giant, Huawei”. “While working for Huawei, Mr Xenophon did not register it with the Australian Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme,” Patrick said. “In this, he appears to have relied on the exemption for persons providing legal advice to foreign organisations and a claim that he was not directly lobbying government ministers. “However, the work that Xenophon Davis did for Huawei appears to have been largely in the public relations field and directed towards influencing the federal government to reopen the door for Huawei to infiltrate Australia’s 5G telecommunications network.” Xenophon said on Wednesday Patrick’s observations were “miserable”. He said he had not worked for Huawei for more than 18 months. He noted former politicians, including John Brumby and the Howard-era Liberal foreign affairs minister Alexander Downer, once served on the company’s board. Xenophon said he supported “the bipartisan approach on foreign policy, and on China”. “I want to act for the needs of South Australians – Rex wants to play out his war fantasies.” Patrick is a former submariner, with significant policy interests in defence and foreign affairs, as well as transparency. The Turnbull government blacklisted both Huawei and ZTE from Australia’s 5G network in August 2018 in response to security advice. The United States has also banned Huawei, and warned that European allies who used communications technology provided by it in their networks put intelligence relationships at risk. Patrick said Xenophon’s decision to work for Huawei was a “misjudgment”. “Mr Xenophon now says that he has not worked for Huawei for some time, though we don’t know when he ceased,” Patrick said. “He now claims to support the Australian government’s 5G ban on Huawei. As a declared Senate candidate, he should now, in the interests of transparency and accountability, disclose the full details of his contractual relationship with Huawei”. “He should disclose the terms, conditions and duration of his contract; what instructions he accepted from Huawei; and precisely what services he and Mr Davis [Xenophon’s partner in his legal practice] were paid for”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Patrick isn’t the only politician on the warpath about Xenophon. After he confirmed he would stand for the Senate last week, the Liberal senator James Paterson, who chairs parliament’s intelligence and security committee, said the former senator had questions to answer. Federal parliament is sitting for the final week before Scott Morrison calls the election. With the finish line in sight, politicians are using the platform of the parliament to position themselves for the coming contest. In Tuesday night’s adjournment debate, as well as Patrick taking on Xenophon, the Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells launched an extraordinary attack on Morrison in parliament, labelling him an “autocrat [and] a bully who has no moral compass”. The senator – who has recently been relegated to an unwinnable spot on the Liberal party’s NSW Senate ticket – used a late-night speech in the upper house on Tuesday to accuse the prime minister of destroying the Liberal party.",News/Australia news,Rex Patrick takes aim at Nick Xenophon over Huawei in parliament remarks as former senator rejoins race,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/30/rex-patrick-takes-aim-at-nick-xenophon-over-huawei-in-parliament-remarks-as-former-senator-rejoins-race
