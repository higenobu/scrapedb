3/1/2022,"As rockets fall and tanks roll on the cities and towns of Ukraine, the rest of the world has borne witness with an unprecedented intensity, due almost entirely to the internet. Anyone who has scrolled social media in the last few days has seen dozens of disturbing images from the ground in Ukraine, protests from St. Peterburg to Sydney to Times Square, and iconic buildings around the globe illuminated in blue and yellow. Plus there is the intel gleaned from Twitter and foreign news organizations that are now more globally available than ever, not to mention the internet’s own direct role in the conflict—reports of Ukrainian hackers combating Russian propaganda and Anonymous taking over Russian airwaves to play the Ukrainian national anthem, to name two examples. In one of the latest displays of the power of the internet, a Twitter account called Russian Oligarch Jets appeared just yesterday that tracks the current movement of the private aircraft of the likes of Roman Abramovich (one of his jets landed in Latvia yesterday) and Alexander Abramov (one of his planes recently landed in Abu Dhabi, another in Munich). Another, @PutinJet, is also tracking planes owned by Putin and Russian VIPS. Meanwhile, other internet sleuths are tracking oligarch-owned yachts.

Not that foreign shores will necessarily be friendly: a Ukranian sailor in Mallorca was arrested this weekend for sabotaging the $8 million yacht of Russian arms dealer Alexander Mikheev, and Anonymous hackers sent Putin’s yacht, the reportedly $97 million “Graceful,” straight to “hell”: Putin reportedly has a $97 million luxury yacht called ""Graceful"".

3/1/2022,"The crisis in Ukraine cast a shadow over Chinese efforts to mark the 50th anniversary of an important milestone in its relationship with the United States as a former American official warned that ties would worsen if Beijing maintains its current position. ""Fifty years ago, the USSR was a common threat that brought us together. Today, Russian aggression threatens to drive us further apart,"" former US treasury secretary Jacob Lew said in an online speech to an event to mark the signing of the Shanghai Communique, which paved the way for the establishment of formal relations. ""This is the moment when nations of the world respecting international order are joining together condemning Russia's illegal attack on Ukraine,"" said Lew, now the chair of the board of directors at the National Committee on US-China relations, a non-profit organisation.

""China must decide where to stand and understand that the bilateral relationship with the US will only become more strained in the absence of a clear choice to stand with intervention."" Monday's event was hosted by the semi-official Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries and the Shanghai municipal government to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the communique, signed at the end of president Richard Nixon's visit to China in 1972. Those attending the event included a number of senior Chinese officials, including Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Shanghai Communist Party chief Li Qiang and Qin Gang, the ambassador to Washington. But no incumbent US official spoke at the event, though the charge d'affaires at the US embassy David Meale was there. The event was held at a time when US-China relations are the worst in decades and days after the Russia invasion of Ukraine. China, along with India and the United Arab Emirates, abstained in a UN Security Council vote on Friday on a resolution to condemn Russia's attack on Ukraine. On Monday, officials from the Chinese side largely bypassed the topic and focused on the Taiwan issue, which Wang described as the biggest sticking point in the relationship with the US. Wang said ""the principles and spirit established by the Shanghai Communique ... have not been truly followed"". In a pre-recorded speech, Wang said US commitments to Taiwan, including commitments to help the island defend itself, contradicted its commitment to the one-China principle set out in the 1972 agreement. The US ""acknowledges"" Beijing's stance that there is only one China and that Taiwan is part of it. Wang also said China was willing to work with the US on the Build Back Better World, a G7-led global infrastructure plan, and would welcome Washington joining its Belt and Road Initiative. Former Chinese ambassador to the US Cui Tianka said he believed the Shanghai Communique remained relevant on issues including ""Nato expansion"". There is no direct mention of North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in the communique, which affirmed that neither nation ""should seek hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region and each is opposed to efforts by any country or group of countries to establish such hegemony"". Another event planned for Fudan University in Shanghai on Sunday has been postponed because of concerns about Covid-19. Monday's event stood in contrast to when the two countries celebrated the event at its 40th anniversary in 2012, when Chinese President Xi Jinping, then vice-president, was the highest level official at a ceremony in Beijing, where he welcomed Henry Kissinger, who played a key role in the Nixon administration's visit to China. Kissinger, who sent a pre-recorded speech to the event on Monday, said it was inevitable there would be disagreements between the two countries over some issues. ""But what we should learn from the past and what I hope we can project in to the future is that we maintain a permanent dialogue and that we tell each other frankly what our thinking is on key issues, and that we should do that with an attitude that in the world of modern technology, pressure and military threats, we will not do anything that threatens the two halves of humanity."" He added that the development of ""great technology"" by both sides would have threatening aspects that ""must be discussed to be kept limited or removed"".

3/1/2022,"A senior US official said Ukraine's airspace remains contested, contradicting Moscow's claims. Russia was expected to swiftly knock out Ukraine's air defense capabilities, but that has not happened. Ukraine has claimed to have shot down Russian fighter jets, helicopters, and even troop transport planes. Despite Russian claims to the contrary, Ukraine's airspace remains contested as the country's forces fight to repel Russian aggression, a senior US defense official said on Monday during an off-camera press briefing. ""The Russians have not achieved air superiority over the whole country,"" the official told reporters. ""Ukrainian air defenses remain intact and viable in terms of aircraft and missile defense systems, and they're engaged."" ""It's a contested airspace, and it's a very dynamic airspace,"" the official continued, contradicting Moscow's claims this morning that Russia has ""total air superiority"" over Ukraine. It has been five days since Russia launched a large-scale attack on Ukraine, attacking the country from several directions and pushing towards Kyiv, the capital city. Russian forces have conducted airstrikes on positions in and around Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, forcing numerous civilians to take shelter in basements and metro stations. One video uploaded to Twitter on Monday shows incoming and outgoing fire over Kyiv, which is consistent with an engagement between aviation assets and air-defense systems. —Michael Kofman (@KofmanMichael) February 28, 2022 Another video posted on social media Monday appeared to show surface-to-air missiles targeting air assets, purportedly over Kyiv. —Christopher Miller (@ChristopherJM) February 28, 2022 In recent days, Ukraine has claimed to have shot down fighters, helicopters, and even transport planes. Early in the fighting against Russia, for instance, Ukraine's armed forces said that they had downed five Russian aircraft and a helicopter, CNN reported, but the Russian military denied these claims. Russia only recently acknowledged taking losses in the conflict with Ukraine, but it insists that Ukrainian losses are significantly worse than it's own. A video that was released by Ukraine's military last Thursday seemed to show one helicopter being shot down over Hostomel, a town on the outskirts of Kyiv, and Ukraine's Armed Forces posted a video of what was said to be a damaged Russian helicopter in that area. —ВОЇНИ УКРАЇНИ🇺🇦 (@ArmedForcesUkr) February 24, 2022 Ukraine's top general Valeriy Zaluzhiny claimed Friday that the country's armed forces shot down a Russian Ilyushin Il-76 plane near Kyiv, the Kyiv Independent reported. The Il-76 is mainly used for heavy transport and paratrooper operations and could carry up to 150 soldiers, according to the Kyiv Independent. The Ukrainian military, according to The War Zone, also said it shot down a helicopter and a Su-25 close-air support aircraft with an S-300 missile system. Russia was expected to quickly eliminate Ukraine's air defense capabilities earlier in the conflict, but so far that does not appear to have happened.

3/1/2022,"STORY: Video footage showed that a bridge in the town had been blown up, It was unclear whether it had been bombed by Russian troops or destroyed by the Ukrainian side. Streets in the town were deserted and shops had been destroyed and looted. The Russian invasion - the biggest assault on a European state since World War Two - has failed to achieve the decisive early gains that Putin would have hoped for, with Ukrainian fighters putting up more resistance than expected. Russian forces are believed to be trying to encircle Kyiv in the coming days, and the fear is fighting will become more aggressive with Russia frustrated at their slow advance on the Ukrainian capital.

3/1/2022,"NBC News chief foreign correspondent Richard Engel came under fire Monday after posting a tweet that seemed to lament that the U.S. had not yet attacked Russia for invading Ukraine. Engel noted Monday that a massive Russian convoy was in a position to be destroyed by the U.S. or NATO and said that direct involvement against Russia would risk “everything,” meaning a nuclear war. However, in the next sentence, he said, “Does the West watch in silence as it rolls?” But as Reason.com noted, “the U.S. cannot attack Russia because Congress has yet to declare war on the country. And make no mistake, a direct attack on Russian forces by either the U.S. or NATO would be an act of war” and dramatically increase the risk of nuclear warfare. Many Twitter users were shocked that Engel seemed almost eager to get his war on and also tried to remind him: Be careful what you wish for. Some people offered advice to Engel in hopes he’d rethink the point he was making in his tweet. i dunno if i was a chief foreign correspondent i would not glibly wonder why one nuclear power isn't carpet bombing another nuclear power's forces https://t.co/O1dkxPUfDw — Edward Ongweso Jr (@bigblackjacobin) February 28, 2022 if you want a war so badly, go enlist https://t.co/1Q6uJ3GSHV — Sarah Jones (@onesarahjones) February 28, 2022 Pro tip: do not tweet questions like this until you've given at least, oh, I don't know, a whole thirty seconds of thought to steps two, three, and four of your decision tree. https://t.co/HLnfV7p2wd — Daniel W.

3/1/2022,"A woman had human feces smeared on her face as she waited for the train at a New York City subway platform during rush hour, police say. Police are looking for the man who they say attacked the woman, 43, as she was sitting on a bench at the East 241st Street subway station in the Bronx on Monday, Feb. 21. Video shared by the New York City Police Department shows the man holding what appears to be a black plastic bag approach the woman and throw the bag into the front of her face at 5:15 p.m. In the footage, the unidentified man appears to push the bag into her face. When she buckles forward, he continued to put the bag on the back of her head then walked away. Police are asking for help identifying the man behind the incident. The attack took place just three days before another woman was viciously kicked down the steps and hit in the head with a hammer several times at the Queens Plaza subway station. That woman, 57, suffered a fractured skull and lacerations to her head, authorities said. She was taken to New York-Presbyterian Hospital in critical condition. A spate of disturbing attacks have been reported at subway stations in New York City, prompting Mayor Eric Adams and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul to unveil a new plan to combat violence on public transit less than two weeks ago. The city’s transit chief also announced that barriers or doors would be installed on some subway platforms and teams of officers and mental health workers will be deployed to remove homeless people from stations and to ""get rid of disorderly activity"" such as drug use. Anyone with information in regard to this incident is asked to call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782).

3/1/2022,"McCarthy offered a rare rebuke of Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar on Monday. He said it was ""unacceptable"" for the duo to appear at a conference with white supremacist ties. ""For me it was appalling and wrong. And there's no place in our party for any of this,"" said McCarthy. Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy offered a rare rebuke of two members of his caucus on Monday, saying it was ""unacceptable"" for Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Paul Gosar of Arizona to speak at an event held by a man widely described to be white nationalist. McCarthy, who was in Israel with a congressional delegation last week, told Punchbowl News that the news was particularly appalling to him given his visit to the country's Holocaust museum during his time there. ""I took a number of the freshmen, we went and saw Yad Vashem,"" he told Punchbowl's Jake Sherman. ""When I come back I see two colleagues who went a participated with a group that has a leader that many times gives anti-Semitic views, and led a chant for Putin."" On Friday, Greene made a surprise appearance at the America First Conference in Orlando. The event was hosted by Nick Fuentes, who has been described by the Anti-Defamation League as ""well-known white supremacist pundit and organizer."" Prior to introducing Greene, Fuentes asked the crowd to ""give a round of applause for Russia."" ""For me it was appalling and wrong. And there's no place in our party for any of this,"" said McCarthy. ""The party should not be associated any time any place with somebody who is anti-Semitic."" Greene sought to address the controversy over the weekend, telling reporters at CPAC that she doesn't ""know what [Fuentes'] views are, so I'm not aligned with anything that may be controversial."" Her office later issued a lengthy statement characterizing attendees as ""young conservatives who feel cast aside and marginalized by society."" ""She has personally gone to answer this. But I think with that introduction, you should've walked off stage,"" McCarthy added. ""This is unacceptable."" Sherman also reported that McCarthy plans to speak with Greene this week. Her office did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. NEW.

The former has quickly become a thorn in the side of GOP leadership for her outrageous remarks, while the latter was censured by the House in November for releasing an anime video that depicted him killing Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on New York. Both have been removed from their committee assignments, though McCarthy previously pledged to restore their positions as committee members should Republicans retake the House majority.
