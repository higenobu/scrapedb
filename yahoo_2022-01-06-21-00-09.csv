1/6/2022,"Chicago schools closed on Wednesday after the teachers' union voted to pivot to remote learning. Parents are in limbo as it remains unclear whether public schools will be in person or not. Being in the dark about future school procedures is inconvenient and scary, parents told Insider. Chicago schools closed for the day on Wednesday after the teachers' union voted to pivot to remote learning — and now parents aren't sure whether classes will even be held in the next coming days. Parents of students in the Chicago Public Schools — the third-largest district in the US — told Insider they're stressed out because they don't know whether there will be classes. And if there are classes, it's not clear whether they'll be remote or in person. The uncertainty has left them without answers and unable to adequately plan their days. And the prospect of in-person learning is scary, they said. Rachael H., a mother of three kids enrolled in CPS schools, said she kept her third-grader home on Monday when schools reopened for in-person learning after the holiday break. That same day, she said, there was a COVID-19 exposure and her child's 30 other classmates who showed up had to quarantine and learn remotely the next day. On Tuesday, her third-grader showed up to school, and ""it was a total of her and one other student in the classroom,"" Rachael said. ""But her and another child were in the school,"" Rachael said. ""And then she told me that she had to have lunch with a whole nother classroom because her teacher had to go out for lunch. So that means she's being exposed again to another set of students, just for her to have a lunch break."" Government officials have been urging schools nationwide to conduct in-person learning after the winter break, but the spread of Omicron has complicated that effort. While schools shifted from completely remote to hybrid or in-person learning environments as vaccines became more commonplace — and nearly 63% of the total population fully vaccinated against the coronavirus — the highly contagious variant has led to a surge in cases, worsening staff shortages that have plagued US school systems. Chicago Public Schools has a 2.7% teacher vacancy rate, a district spokesperson said in an email to Insider. On January 3, the school system had a teacher attendance rate of 82%, leaving school administrators scrambling to cover classes. There's an ongoing search for substitute teachers, the spokesperson said. The spread of the variant has alarmed teachers. An overwhelming majority — 88% — of the Chicago Teachers' Union on Tuesday announced that it would vote for all public schools in the city to return to remote learning, arguing that classroom conditions are unsafe for children and faculty. ""To the parents and guardians of this city, we want you to know that when you put your children in our care we put their well-being and safety first,"" a union statement read. ""We fight for your children like they are our own, because they are."" The union's position runs counter to the message coming from city officials. Mayor Lori Lightfoot has taken a stance in favor of in-person learning, arguing that it provides better educational benefits for children and less stress on parents who'd otherwise be forced to look after their kids during the daytime. On Wednesday, CPS teachers were seemingly locked out of digital classrooms so as to not carry out remote learning, Gizmodo reported. —ChicagoTeachersUnion (@CTULocal1) January 5, 2022 Rachael, a social worker who works from home, said she'd rather her children learn remotely while there's a significant viral threat. She said she hasn't been informed of the plans, and it feels like the school district is operating on a whim. ""When these positivity rate numbers go up, they need to take precautions to just have the remote learning until the numbers can go down,"" Rachael said. ""Just waiting until the last minute is unacceptable."" Parents often don't know what's happening until just hours before school is scheduled to open, according to Valeisha Manning, a mother of three children who are enrolled at CPS. The school district, for example, informed her that it would be closed on Wednesday at 11:30 p.m. CPS did not immediately respond to a request for comment asking about the times at which parents are notified of the next day's status. Not knowing whether classes will be remote or in-person is inconvenient, partly because parents may have to make arrangements to pick up equipment so their children can learn from home productively. Rachael, for example, would have to retrieve Chromebooks from the school for each of her three children. Other parents would likely not be able to do that on such quick notice. ""There are parents who don't have the ability to go and just pick up devices,"" Rachael said. And if officials do decide on in-person learning, it can be scary for parents to send their kids to school, said Manning and Rachael, both adding that they've seen videos of mask-less students clustered close together on school grounds. ""I know they need to be amongst their peers for social development, I understand that,"" Manning said. ""But there's no social development that comes to a dead child or a sick child or a child that's in ICU.""

1/6/2022,"On Wednesday’s Anderson Cooper 360, former Fox News Chief Political Correspondent Carl Cameron weighed in on his former colleague Sean Hannity. On Tuesday, the January 6 House Select Committee sent a letter to Hannity requesting information pertaining to last year’s attack on the Capitol building. The request was signed by committee chair Bennie Thompson and vice chair Liz Cheney. They wrote, ""You appear also to have detailed knowledge regarding President Trump's state of mind in the days following the January 6th attack.” It has also been revealed that Hannity allegedly texted then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Rep. Jim Jordan prior to President Biden's inauguration. ""Guys, we have a clear path to land the plane in 9 days,” Hannity texted. “He can't mention the election again. Ever. I did not have a good call with him today. And worse, I'm not sure what is left to do or say, and I don't like not knowing if it's truly understood. Ideas?"" Cameron appears to believe this information to be in conflict with what Hannity shared with viewers of his self-titled popular cable news show. “Bottom line, it looks like Sean may have been playing both sides of the fence and got caught,” Cameron said. “Fox viewers saw him as gung-ho for all of this when, in fact, he was talking to both Meadows and Jordan saying we have got a problem.” While Cameron believes Hannity should cooperate with the committee's request he also believes that the politicians are the ones who should ultimately be held accountable. “Sean Hannity for all intents and purposes was an acolyte of Rush Limbaugh 25, 30 years ago as a radio talking head,” Cameron said. “He's not a journalist, doesn't profess to be. In fact, he says that himself. And so it really is the politicians who have to be held accountable to this, particularly the likes of Jordan and Meadows.” Anderson Cooper 360 airs weeknights at 8 p.m. on CNN. See why congressman warns ‘voting as we know it in this country will be gone’ if Republicans take control of House: During Monday’s “All In With Chris Hayes,” Democrat congressman Eric Swalwell issued a warning about the upcoming midterm elections.
“I'm worried that if Republicans win in the midterm elections, that voting as we know it in this country will be gone,” Swalwell said. “This is not only the most important election. If we don't get it right, it could be the last election.”
Swalwell cited GOP lawmakers who are trying to suppress voting rights in order to gain control of the House.
“They're already putting as many barriers to the ballot box as possible in Arizona, Florida, Texas, Georgia,” Swalwell said. “And on the other side of the finish line, they're putting in place processes where they could reverse the outcome even if we crawl through glass and run through the fire to get to the ballot box. If they are able to win the house, the damage they could do, you know, to permanently make it difficult to vote and just alter the way that we participate in a democratic process could be irreversible.”
Fearful of the long term ramifications from restricting voter access, the Democrat representative hopes that all qualified voters will get registered and make their voices heard.

1/6/2022,"Nazir Ahmed, the former Labour peer, has been found guilty of child sex offences dating back almost 50 years. The 64-year-old, who was formerly Lord Ahmed of Rotherham, was convicted of twice attempting to rape a young girl and also a count of buggery against a young boy. Mohammed Tariq, 65, and Mohammed Faroq, 71 – Ahmed’s two older brothers, who were both found unfit to plead or take part in the trial – were also found to have committed indecent assaults. Sheffield Crown Court heard how Ahmed’s female victim went to police in 2016 to make allegations dating back to the early Seventies, when he was aged about 16 or 17. During the trial, the jury was played a recording of a telephone call between her and the male victim when they both discussed the abuse. Tom Little QC, prosecuting, told the jury that the call was prompted by the man contacting the woman by email saying: “I have evidence against that paedophile.” The judge, Mr Justice Lavender, will determine on Wednesday afternoon when Ahmed will be sentenced. Rosemary Ainslie, the head of the CPS Special Crime Division, said: “We asked the jury to dispassionately consider the evidence against each of these men and decide if they could be sure that our prosecution had proved they committed these crimes. “By these verdicts, the jury has clearly decided that no matter the delay between the offences and the trial, and the defences raised, they could be sure that the accounts of the victims were credible and true. “One of these defendants held a position of power, influence and responsibility for some time in the House of Lords. But this case clearly illustrates that where there is sufficient evidence, even in challenging cases, the CPS will bring a prosecution, put evidence before a jury and see rightful convictions.” Ahmed’s conviction on charges of historic child sex abuse marks the downfall of a controversial figure who was dogged by scandal throughout his political career and personal life. Born in Kashmir, the disputed area of Pakistan in 1957, he came to the UK with his parents aged 12, not speaking a word of English, and settled in Rotherham, South Yorkshire. Politically ambitious, he joined the Labour Party at 18 and studied public administration at Sheffield Polytechnic. He became a Labour councillor in Rotherham in 1990 and was made chairman of the South Yorkshire Labour Party three years later. A passionate advocate of British Pakistani affairs, he founded the British Muslim Councillor’s Forum and also became a magistrate. In 1998, he was created a life peer, Baron Ahmed of Rotherham, and often used the platform to defend British Muslims. He campaigned against forced marriage and criticised the wearing of the face veil by some British Muslim women. However, his outspoken views on sensitive issues and allegations of anti-Semitism often brought him into conflict with his own colleagues and party, and sometimes tainted his reputation in Parliament. Following the 9/11 attacks, Ahmed claimed his phones had been tapped by the Government because of his opposition to the war in Afghanistan. Ahmed regularly attacked Labour over its foreign policy and was highly critical when Sir Tony Blair knighted writer Salman Rushdie, the author of The Satanic Verses, which he claimed was deeply offensive to Islam. But away from politics, it was his personal life where things dramatically unravelled. On Christmas Day 2007, he was involved in a fatal crash on the M1 in South Yorkshire for which he was eventually jailed for 12 weeks. He was convicted of dangerous driving after a court heard how he had been using his mobile phone to send text messages just before he hit a 28-year-old man who had got out of his car following a crash. Ahmed was subsequently freed from jail after the Court of Appeal said the original sentence should have been suspended. However, in 2013 he was suspended from Labour after giving an interview to a Pakistani media outlet in which he blamed his conviction on a “Jewish conspiracy”. He suggested he had been targeted because he had visited Gaza to lend his support to the Palestinians. Ed Miliband, the Labour leader at the time, described the comments as “disgraceful” and ordered an investigation. Ahmed later apologised for the comments and said they were “completely wrong” and “unacceptable” and he subsequently resigned from the Labour Party. In February 2019, he was accused of sexual impropriety after a woman came forward to allege that he had exploited her vulnerability to pursue a relationship with her. The woman, who was being treated for anxiety and depression, approached the peer believing he might be able to help her get the Metropolitan Police to investigate a faith healer who she believed was exploiting women. However, she later claimed the married father-of-three had used his position to pursue a sexual relationship with her before suddenly breaking off all contact. Following an investigation into the matter, the Commissioner for Standards concluded: “I find that Lord Ahmed exploited [the woman] emotionally and sexually even though he knew she was receiving treatment for anxiety and depression. This exacerbates the seriousness of his breaches of the Code.”",World/The Telegraph,Lord Ahmed found guilty of trying to rape a young girl,https://news.yahoo.com/lord-ahmed-found-guilty-trying-152529857.html
