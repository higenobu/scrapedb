2/24/2022,"More than 1,600 care-home beds have been lost in just six months, as worsening staff shortages and the financial strain following two years of the Covid pandemic have caused a net loss of 134 homes in England. The deregistrations, which were not outweighed by new openings, came as staff shortages almost doubled, to 11% of the workforce, from August to the end of January, according to figures released on Wednesday by the Care Quality Commission.  Three-quarters of care homes which responded to a survey also told the regulator they had been unable to recruit staff, the biggest problem being the mandatory Covid-19 vaccine policy, which was scrapped at the start of February. Obligatory double vaccination for social care staff was introduced on 11 November 2021 and about 40,000 staff left their jobs, sparking anger among care home operators who said the staff had been unfairly singled out for the mandate. Two-fifths of care homes now believe a lack of staff is having a negative impact on care. CQC figures show there was also a surge in incidents affecting the health, safety and welfare of residents in December, which were caused by staffing issues. The area with the biggest reduction in care home registrations was south-east England. The crisis in staffing has been compounded by Covid outbreaks in care homes, which have forced the organisations to stop admitting new residents. It has increased pressure on homecare services, which are also struggling with their own acute workforce crisis. In Cornwall the family of a man with advanced multiple sclerosis urgently seeking a care home place, was told this week by officials that there were only five places available in the county and that about 200 people needed them, including those awaiting discharge from hospital. Shelagh Young, said her brother, Bob Young, had been left for periods sitting in urine and excrement at his home, and was waitingfor a respite care placement. The 58-year-old had wanted to stay at home, previously declining a move to a home. He had had sporadic help from community nurses and a volunteer charity but on Monday told his sister this was “no kind of life”. She said she sympathised with the county officials who were trying to get him help, but they told her the shortages were linked to a deficit of care workers. Cornwall county council was contacted for comment. Vic Rayner, chief executive of the National Care Forum, which represents not-for-profit care operators, said the CQC figures had to be a wake up call. “We have been warning about this staffing shortage for months now and this data may be the tip of the iceberg. Our members have been telling us that it is proving harder and harder to recruit staff, which is exacerbating the workforce pressures. “There is an urgent need to think strategically about the social care needed within communities, and to plan and resource the social care workforce in a way that ensures that people can exercise their right to high-quality social care when and where they need it.” Kate Terroni, chief inspector of adult social care, told the CQC board that after nearly 1,900 inspections since the start of December the area in need of most improvement was found to be infection control. Families of care-home residents are now also concerned that lateral flow tests for visitors to the establishments will no longer be free of charge. The Rights for Residents campaign group described the change as an immoral “pay per view” policy and are demanding reinstatement of the free tests. CQC reported that it also investigated allegations of blanket visiting bans at 82 homes in recent months, in breach of government guidelines.",News/Society,"Care homes in England close 1,600 beds in six month-period",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/23/care-homes-in-england-close-1600-beds-in-six-month-period
2/24/2022,"France has extended its time limit for abortion after an epic battle in parliament, amid anger that thousands of women had to travel abroad each year to terminate pregnancies in countries such as the Netherlands, Spain or England because of French restrictions. There was applause in the French national assembly on Thursday when lawmakers voted definitively to extend the legal limit for ending a pregnancy from 12 to 14 weeks. France’s new time frame is still lower than some other European countries including England, at 24 weeks.  The health minister, Olivier Véran, said it was crucial “to end the distress of the thousands of women who have to go abroad” for abortions. But it took more than a year of bitter rows and struggle by politicians to change the law, amid reticence from the president, Emmanuel Macron, himself. The law was passed in the final hours of the current parliament, before it closes ahead of April’s presidential election. Macron had expressed his opposition to extending the abortion time limit to 14 weeks in an interview with Elle magazine last summer, saying it was “more traumatising” for women to terminate pregnancies at a later limit. He then told journalists that “extended time limits are not neutral in terms of a woman’s trauma”. Laurence Rossignol, the former Socialist minister for families, told the senate last month that Macron was stuck in a cliche of the past when illegal abortion was traumatic. She said times had changed since the legalisation of abortion in France in 1975 and women should not be made to feel guilty, or as if they had failed, if they ended a pregnancy. “I had an abortion and I am not traumatised,” she told the senate as another senator stood and announced the same. The change to France’s abortion time limit was first proposed by Albane Gaillot, a lawmaker who had broken off from Macron’s La République En Marche party. She called it a “step forward” for women. Marie-Noëlle Battistel, a Socialist lawmaker who co-wrote the law, called it “a big day for the rights of women”. Even though the change to the abortion time limit was not a government project, lawmakers from Macron’s party decided to back the law and push it through parliament, independent of Macron’s position. The government allowed a free vote. Macron said he would “respect the freedom of parliamentarians”. The health minister had personally approved the law and told parliament the 14-week time limit, and an increase in abortion services in France, was a “victory for society”, a “very important day for parliament” and for the “fight for the emancipation of women”. He said the law would add to the measures introduced by the government for women’s health, including free contraception for women under 25. Lawmakers on the left expressed disappointment that they did not manage to scrap a special clause which gives French health practitioners the right to refuse to perform an abortion on moral grounds. They said this clause perpetuated stigma around abortion. They said they would continue to fight to get the clause scrapped. Last month, Macron told the European parliament that the right to abortion should be added to the EU’s charter of fundamental rights, just a day after the parliament elected Malta’s Roberta Metsola, who opposes abortion, as its president.",News/World news,France extends abortion limit after year of parliamentary rows,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/france-extends-abortion-limit-after-year-of-parliamentary-rows
2/24/2022,"Lewis Hamilton has accused Formula One stewards of potential bias towards specific drivers and teams as old wounds were reopened on the first day of pre-season testing in Barcelona on Wednesday. The seven-times world champion, who was controversially denied an eighth title at the season finale in 2021, suggested there was institutionalised favouritism the sport had to address.  “We need to make sure we get non-biased stewards,” he said. “Racing drivers, some are very, very good friends with certain individuals. Some travel with certain individuals, and tend to take more of a keen liking to some of them. “I just think [we need] people who have no bias and are super central when it comes to making decisions.” Last week Hamilton had expressed his disappointment at the then-race director Michael Masi’s decisions at the fateful Abu Dhabi GP where Hamilton was overtaken by Max Verstappen on the last lap, leading to the Dutchman’s maiden world title. Masi has since been removed from his post by the FIA and the British driver had made it clear he wanted to move on. However, speaking at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya before climbing behind the wheel of his Mercedes W13, Hamilton chose to make this striking accusation of bias. Four stewards are assigned to each race by the FIA, at least one of whom will be a driver who has raced at a competitive level. Vitantonio Liuzzi, who competed for Red Bull in 2005 and then its sister team, formerly Toro Rosso, in 2006 and 2007, was employed by the FIA at four of the 22 races last year. Liuzzi was the driver steward at last year’s Brazilian GP, one of the four stewards who controversially opted not to penalise Verstappen for driving Hamilton off the road while defending his place. The decision was questioned by many drivers in appearing inconsistent after similar incidents that season had resulted in a penalty and was brought up by drivers at their briefing at the following round in Qatar. The Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff questioned the accusation of bias while backing his driver in the call for the stewarding to reach a uniform standard. “We need professionalism in the steward’s room,” he said. “I don’t think there is conscious bias to be honest. Most important, whether we talk about race direction or the stewards there needs to be a standard. “This is what we deserve, this is what everybody expects. We have all talked about the consistency. There should not be a lot of room to interpret rules, there should not be leniency depending on what a potential outcome might be. The rules are rules.” Red Bull’s team principal Christian Horner echoed the call for consistency but denied he believed there had been any bias shown by stewards. “We have all been on the end of stewards’ decisions we have been unhappy about,” he said. “I don’t think there is an intended bias, I am not aware of stewards travelling with drivers to races. Giving a better infrastructure for clearer decisions and clearer regulations is something that should be strived for but I certainly don’t think there has been any bias from stewards through the last seasons.” F1 has entered the opening phase of a new era in Barcelona with the cars on track for the first time after a raft of sweeping regulation changes, aimed at improving the racing. They present a fundamental change in aerodynamic philosophy, attempting to mandate the majority of downforce is created by ground effect to decrease and divert the wash behind a car and allow for greater overtaking opportunities. Intriguingly there has been a variety of interpretations of the rules, making for a range of diversion of design. In testing they all cleared the first hurdle, they look good on track and on day one were running with consistency and no shortage of pace, especially through the faster corners despite carrying greater weight this season. Charles Leclerc toped the timesheets in the morning session for Ferrari, putting in 80 laps. Hamilton, now entering his 16th season, took to the track in the afternoon and completed a solid run, fifth fastest with 50 laps under his belt, while Lando Norris was quickest for McLaren in the second session.",Sport/Sport,Lewis Hamilton accuses F1 stewards of potential ‘bias’ towards specific drivers,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/23/lewis-hamilton-accuses-f1-stewards-of-potential-bias-towards-specific-drivers

2/24/2022,"When it was released as a single in May 1967, Procol Harum’s A Whiter Shade of Pale proved an immediate sensation in that year of psychedelia and Sgt Pepper. Gary Brooker, who sang it in his expressively blues-inflected voice and wrote the music to accompany Keith Reid’s lyrics, described how he had been influenced by Jacques Loussier’s interpretation of JS Bach’s Air from his Orchestral Suite No 3 in D major. “The original Hamlet cigar commercial featuring Air on a G String had always been a favourite of ours,” said Brooker, who has died of cancer aged 76. “When the guy lit up the cigar everything just went cool.” But A Whiter Shade of Pale was not just cool, but also stately and mysterious and determined not to give up its secrets easily. Matthew Fisher’s haunting Hammond organ theme seemed to impart an aura of infinite wistfulness.  A Whiter Shade of Pale topped the charts in the UK, Australia and Canada, and went to No 5 in the US. It was by far the biggest hit of the group’s career, though a live version of Conquistador took them into the US Top 20 in 1972, and they revisited the UK Top 20 with Pandora’s Box in 1975. With Brooker the focal point as the group went through numerous lineup changes, their chart performances were patchy. While they scored several Top 30 album entries on either side of the Atlantic and a US No 5 for their 1972 live album recorded with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, they created a lasting aura that was beyond mere chart statistics. They had a charisma that turned a number of eminent listeners into fans, including the writer Douglas Adams, who credited the band’s song Grand Hotel with inspiring his book The Restaurant at the End of the Universe. The film director Martin Scorsese, who was particularly fond of their third album, A Salty Dog (1969), wrote about Procol Harum in the foreword to Henry Scott-Irvine’s 2012 biography of the band: “The point was not so much what the songs were saying, specifically, as what they were suggesting to each of us, individually.” Brooker was born in London, to Violet and Harry Brooker. He recalled that his family “had our own house in Bush Hill Park, a leafy suburb of Enfield, and I remember life being very comfortable”. Harry was a professional musician who played the pedal steel guitar with Felix Mendelssohn’s Hawaiian Serenaders. The band secured a residency in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, with the family moving there in 1954. Brooker’s mother “encouraged me to have a profession, as long as it wasn’t music”. When Gary was 11 his father died suddenly, forcing Violet to work on a factory assembly line while Gary helped out by doing an early-morning paper round. He attended Westcliff high school for boys, while studying the piano with Ronald Meachen, under whose unorthodox guidance Brooker’s playing developed rapidly. When he was 12 he joined a skiffle group, the Electrics, then formed the Coasters, playing rock’n’roll instrumentals. When a local entrepreneur, Peter Martin, conceived the notion of forming a new band called the Paramounts by recruiting members from several groups, he hired Brooker to play the piano. The Paramounts included three other future members of Procol Harum, the guitarist Robin Trower, drummer BJ Wilson and guitarist (later bassist) Chris Copping. The Paramounts developed a reputation as an accomplished rock’n’roll and R&B band, and impressed the Rolling Stones when they supported them at a gig in Walmer in Kent in September 1963. Keith Richards told Melody Maker in March 1964 that the Paramounts were “one of the best groups to come up for a long time”. In late 1963 they were signed by EMI’s Parlophone label, and their recording of the Leiber and Stoller composition Poison Ivy reached No 35 on the UK chart. It was to be the most successful of their seven single releases, though the Paramounts enjoyed a number of career highlights before they split in mid-1966. They also played some gigs backing Sandie Shaw, including one at the Paris Olympia with an orchestra, and a couple of dates supporting the Beatles on their last British concert tour in December 1965. Brooker dissolved the band to concentrate on songwriting and, at the instigation of the producer and A&R man Guy Stevens, got together with the lyricist Keith Reid. One of the songs they wrote together was A Whiter Shade of Pale, apparently inspired by a remark by Stevens to his wife, Diane, about her pallid appearance. Reid and Stevens set about building a new group to perform their songs, with the name Procol Harum taken from a Siamese cat belonging to a mutual friend. A Whiter Shade of Pale was released as a single and sailed into history. After Procol Harum split up in 1977, Brooker pursued a solo career and released the albums No More Fear of Flying (1979), Lead Me to the Water (1982) and Echoes in the Night (1985). In 1979 he joined Eric Clapton’s band, appearing on the album Another Ticket. He was in demand with many high-profile names, and toured with Ringo Starr’s All-Starr Band and Bill Wyman’s Rhythm Kings. He performed at the George Harrison tribute, Concert For George, in November 2002, having featured on Harrison’s albums All Things Must Pass, Somewhere In England and Gone Troppo. He also appeared on recordings by the Hollies, the Alan Parsons Project and Kate Bush. In 1991 Procol Harum reformed and released the album The Prodigal Stranger, the prelude to years of successful international touring. In 2007, fans organised a 40th anniversary tribute to A Whiter Shade of Pale comprising two concerts at St John’s Smith Square in London, one by Procol Harum and one by Gary Brooker & Friends. Another committed Procol Harum fan was the film director Alan Parker, who cast Brooker as the Argentine foreign minister Juan Atilio Bramuglia in his film of Evita (1996). From 2005 to 2009, Brooker was engaged in a lawsuit with Fisher, in which Fisher claimed he co-wrote the music for A Whiter Shade of Pale. The law lords finally ruled in Fisher’s favour, entitling him to a share of the song’s future royalties. Brooker later estimated the case had cost him £1m, but “I haven’t totalled it up because it would frighten me too much”. He received an award from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors in 2009 for his contribution to music, and in 2003 was made MBE. He is survived by his wife, Franky Riedo, whom he married in 1968.

2/24/2022,"Joe Root has declined to divulge his role in the decision to drop Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad for the West Indies tour but said it does not shut the door on their record-breaking careers. On the day Anderson followed Broad by venting his frustration and saying he was “praying” this is not the end, Root was pressed in his first press conference since the Ashes defeat put his own captaincy in doubt on whether he sanctioned the call, despite not having a vote in the selection meeting chaired by Andrew Strauss.  “I don’t think we should have to air every single bit of information,” said Root before the team’s departure for Antigua on Thursday. “Clearly, it was a discussion point for a long period of time but the decision has been made and we’ve got to look at the squad we have got and how we’re going to beat West Indies. Sometimes we have been slightly too honest and certain things should stay in the room. I think that’s the case with this scenario. “I’ve spoken to Stuart and Jimmy and they’re obviously disappointed, angry, and Stuart in particular has voiced that quite publicly. And you’d expect that. I’ve got a huge amount of respect for both of them. At no point – it’s been made very clear – no one is saying this is the end for them.” Like Broad, Anderson is waiting on the appointment of England’s new management team and their views on the subject, while also sharing similar disgruntlement that a “five-minute phone call” from Strauss – temporarily in charge – relayed the news. The 39-year-old appears determined to plough on, however, telling the BBC’s Tailenders podcast: “I’m praying this isn’t the end. But if I never play for England again, I know I’ve got amazing people around me to support me and that’s really important.” “I’ve got one more go at digging deep. I’ve got a lot left to offer – I’ve still got the hunger and passion to play. “There is likely to be a new director of cricket and new head coach so I just hope that whatever decision is made, it is talked about in the way that it should be. Another frustration for me is that it was just a five-minute phone call – it doesn’t really clear much up for you.” Root, who offered a slightly contradictory explanation overall, saying it would give bowlers such as Chris Woakes experience with the new ball for future endeavours and help forge a “backbone for this team”, but in the same breath saying “we’ve got to look after what’s right in front of us”. After one victory in England’s past 14 Tests, the 31-year-old certainly needs results in the three-match series that starts on 8 March and, in a bid to kickstart the ailing batting lineup that failed to pass 300 in Australia, will move up a spot to No 3. Coming off the back of a strong 2021 that included six centuries, Root said he is ready for a berth that has previously proved challenging, with an average of 38 from 30 Tests at first drop, compared with 51 at No 4. Root said: “It’s the first time [moving to No 3] has sat comfortably with me; the first time I’ve been really excited and not slightly apprehensive about it. I am coming into it having had a really strong year with a lot more clarity about how I’m going to score my runs. “I’m not saying that guarantees success, I’ll have to work really hard to transfer those performances to No 3. But I feel excited about it, I’m very motivated and I feel ready for it now. I just want to get my teeth into it, get some runs on the board early and support those openers, get us off to a good start.” Root also shared his sadness that Ashley Giles, Chris Silverwood and Graham Thorpe lost their jobs after the Ashes and on his own continuation as captain he said: “I didn’t waver. I’m very passionate about trying to take this team forward. I’m grateful I’ve got that opportunity. I’m very motivated to come away with what would be a brilliant achievement, [England] having won [in the Caribbean] once since the 1960s.”",Sport/Sport,Joe Root bats away queries of role in dropping Anderson and Broad,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/23/joe-root-dropping-anderson-and-broad-england-west-indies
2/24/2022,"After the second world war British concert and operatic life benefited from keen audiences, expanded education and broadcasting, the commercial success of the long-playing record and public funding of the arts. But there were gaps – opportunities for young performers, new music and lesser-known operas – that called for the flair of an imaginative impresario, though working in a not-for-profit einvironment. John Woolf, who has died aged 91 of cancer, was such a figure. A violinist with what was then the Covent Garden Opera Company, in 1956 he accepted the use of a house in central London – 45 Park Lane, replaced in the 1960s by a nightclub – as the base for an organisation to do the things that others were not doing. For the next 65 years he ran the Park Lane Group virtually on his own, with the help of a supportive committee. Funding came mainly from musical trusts and shared gala performances of West End musicals, with some Arts Council assistance in early years.  From its start the PLG provided the leading platform for young performers of outstanding talent, principally in the Purcell Room at the Southbank Centre, London, from the hall’s opening in 1967. The 1,600 artists presented by the time of John’s death included the pianists John Ogdon and Imogen Cooper, the singers Thomas Allen and Josephine Barstow, the Nash Ensemble and the Arditti Quartet. The work of many living composers was featured, and in this area his efforts were aided by the music publisher Giles Easterbrook. The trust’s other two aims were to mount imaginative musical occasions, and to celebrate the lives and work of great musicians, which it often did by marking anniversaries. In 1962 William Walton conducted his work Façade in the Royal Festival Hall, with Edith Sitwell and Peter Pears reciting her poems to mark her 75th birthday. Outside London, Boulez in Birmingham (2008) took place in the presence of the composer. Park Lane Opera functioned until 1981, often at the Camden festival in London, and there were 25 productions, mostly staged, including Gian Carlo Menotti’s Maria Golovin (1976), directed by the composer. The PLG was particularly active in the 70s. The 1972-73 season, for example, opened with the mezzo-soprano Cathy Berberian in a Parisian salon programme in the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London; later in the season Igor Oistrakh gave a violin recital there. The music of Lord Berners was celebrated by the pianist and PLG founding member Susan Bradshaw, the mezzo-soprano Meriel Dickinson, my sister, and me in songs with piano, and the poet John Betjeman giving readings. John Cages’s Music Circus, with students from Birmingham University, took over the Round House, north London, for its first performance in Europe. Eight concerts including performers from six mainland European countries marked the UK’s accession to the European Economic Community. The soprano Jane Manning took part in an electronic music programme with Tristram Cary. There was jazz, with a commissioned work from Ian Carr, and a programme from the Mike Gibbs Band. Singers included Shirley Verrett in the Royal Festival Hall and Felicity Palmer in the Queen Elizabeth Hall with the Park Lane Players. Born in Nice, in the south of France, John was the son of Antoinette (nee Piguete), and Hermann Woolf, a translator. In June 1940, John and his father escaped from France through Marseille and to Gibraltar on a Scottish collier. Eventually they reached Plymouth, and were able to join his mother and older brother in London. John played the violin in various London orchestras from the mid-1940s. In 1952 he joined the second violins of the orchestra at the Royal Opera House, moving on to the first violins in 1974 and leaving in 1995. He enormously valued his contact with the greatest operatic repertoire, and came to regret selling his fine violin after his departure. After the Covid pandemic made the Purcell Room concerts around new year impossible, John put on lunchtime concerts for young artists that were streamed live from St James’ church, Piccadilly. At the time of his death a new lunchtime series was running at Holy Sepulchre church, High Holborn, and he had other plans in train for the future. John was incredibly generous and dedicated, and an affable companion. He was appointed MBE (1974), an honorary member of the Royal College of Music (1981) and honorary fellow of the Royal Academy of Music (2007). But ever modest, he refused to let me write an article about him and his achievements for his 90th birthday. He was like a gambler with concerts – he could not resist them and undoubtedly put a considerable amount of his own funds into the PLG over many years. His brief marriage to Catherine Roberts ended in divorce, and he is survived by their son, Andrew, a saxophone and clarinet player.

2/24/2022,"The default view at Westminster and in most of the media is that Vladimir Putin has saved Boris Johnson’s skin, for the present. The reflex on the Conservative backbenches is that the prospect of a European war means this is no time for a leadership change. In reality, of course, the reverse is true. Russia’s seizure of parts of Ukraine this week makes the case for replacing Johnson far stronger. That does not mean it will happen – the police investigating “partygate” and the voters have not yet spoken – but it should.  Putin’s annexation of the Donbas provinces is an epochal event. It is an assault on a sovereign European state and a western ally. From the Gulf of Finland in the north to the Danube delta in the south, it ratchets up the military threat to a string of other vulnerable European nations. It redefines at a stroke the security and energy assumptions of our entire continent for a decade and more. It also represents a deliberate and culminating self-inflicted rupture by Russia’s autocracy with the western democracies. This has not come out of nowhere. There have been serious pre-eruptive signals since at least 2008 in Georgia, Crimea and elsewhere, including Salisbury. The Ukraine seizure is nevertheless a wake-up call about the absolute and systemic nature of the break. Relations could now descend into a 21st-century cyber cold war, but one in which a catastrophically divided United States – Donald Trump praised Putin’s action this week as “genius” – can no longer be guaranteed to provide the western pillar. All this poses immense difficulties for every western European nation. The west has drifted into this without much thought – and with nothing approaching the degree of strategic hostile planning of Putin’s Russia. But existential challenges have to be faced all the same. They require a serious and sustained strategic response. Yet the current British government – perhaps even British politics in general – is peculiarly unsuited to this at present, and Johnson is alarmingly ill-qualified to grapple with it effectively as prime minister. Johnson’s approach to government has proved to be the same as his approach to journalism and party politics: performative opportunism. He is not, in any traditional sense, a national leader. Just when this country needs a prime minister with a command of national statecraft, it is saddled with a prime minister who knows only stagecraft. In the Commons, he offers a pastiche of public school parliamentarism. In the world beyond, he dresses up as a builder, a doctor, a police officer or a soldier. On Tuesday, as Putin’s tanks rolled west, he went to the Ministry of Defence and dressed up again, this time as a prime minister in a war room surrounded by chaps in uniform. Johnson’s response to Ukraine may appear engaged. But this is deceptive, and is designed to be. His priority is his own survival, not Ukraine’s. Putin has provided him with a heaven-sent distraction, and Johnson will milk it. The crisis plays to Johnson’s innate desire to act the part of Churchill, though in reality, as his feeble early sanctions show, he is aping Churchill’s language while following the policies of Neville Chamberlain. At every turn, he idiotically hypes the narcissism of small differences to assert that Britain is playing a bigger and more distinct role than it really is. Britain was “out in front” he said twice in the Commons on Wednesday. This is precisely the opposite of what this situation calls for. As aspect after aspect of the Ukraine crisis shows, the reality is that Britain is not the autonomous master of its own fate, let alone of Ukraine’s. Britain is in truth what it has always been, before and after Brexit. It is one of a number of European states, though an important one, that must work together, with serious US backing, to limit the Ukraine conflict, to protect the rest of eastern Europe, to contain Russia, and to defend democracy and the rule of law. In other words, British interests are effectively synonymous and coterminous with those of the European Union and just about every sovereign state in our continent. Part of Johnson’s brain seems to understand this. Unity with allies was absolutely vital, he repeated at prime minister’s questions. But even a stopped clock is right twice a day. The problem is caused by what happens the rest of the time. In the wake of Putin’s actions, two needs stand out for Europe as a whole, Britain included. Each is simultaneously immediate and long term. The first is military: to strengthen and deploy sufficient deterrence to limit further assaults on Ukraine’s sovereignty and to uphold the security of countries bordering Russia, from Norway to Romania. That’s where the threat is greatest. The second is continuity of affordable energy supplies without overdependence on Russian gas or any compromising of green energy goals. These have been in-your-face issues for frontline states for years. Now they are top of everyone’s agenda. They cry out for a unified European tough realism to match that of Russia. The EU has been hopeless about this for many years. Germany dashed for Russian gas when the electorate revolted against nuclear power. France and Italy have bad histories of trying to be Russia’s western interlocutor and favoured trading partner. But Britain has its own big glass house too – the City’s Russian money launderers and the other enablers, including the Tory party – and should not throw stones. All of these things demand an allied cooperative response as well as a certain degree of trust. But who trusts Johnson’s Britain? A country that spends its time poking fun at the EU, playing silly buggers in the Channel over migrants, doing a bit of freelance troublemaking in Poland and threatening to trigger a trade war over Northern Ireland is a country that needs to get real, and fast. Be absolutely clear. Johnson’s Britain is acting as Putin’s useful idiot and playing his game of divide and rule. Nothing in this requires any backtrack on Brexit. But we are Europeans all the same. There is no logic in this country pretending we are an independent, freewheeling, great global power at such a time (nor ever was, come to that). No sense, either, in acting as if our greatest alliance is with reactionary Australia, that we are reborn as an Asia-Pacific player or that we are uniquely equipped to bind the US into Europe. These are the deluded and embarrassing fantasies of a post-imperial nation whose leader can only overplay or underplay. This is a time for seriousness and for action to promote collective self-interest. Putin has reminded western Europeans that war has not disappeared, nor ever will. Security cannot be shirked, and should not be merely dabbled with. There’s a generational task ahead now. We need a government, and a prime minister, who are up to the job, because these ones simply are not.

2/24/2022,"Communities outside London have been placed on a priority list for cultural funding as part of a £75m government plan to level up access to the arts. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) announced on Wednesday that it would redistribute new Arts Council England (ACE) funding to more than 100 locations outside the capital over the next three years.  In addition to the culture recovery fund’s £2bn Covid-19 rescue plan, there will be a 6% increase, or extra £43.5m, in funding to ACE, which the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, has said must be invested outside London. Arts Council England has also been instructed to reallocate at least £24m of investment a year from London to areas outside the capital, and a further £8m will be moved out of London through supporting organisations to relocate or expand. “I have said from day one in this role my priority is to increase access to arts and culture across the whole country,” Dorries said. “Today marks a big step in achieving this aim as we shift new cultural investment into places previously at the back of the queue. Culture enriches people’s lives. It entertains us, brings us together and can be a catalyst for regeneration. Everyone should have access to it no matter where they live or what their background.” In an article for the Yorkshire Post, Dorries called it “one of the biggest ever redistributions of arts funding in our history”. The move comes after the government set out a commitment to raise cultural spending outside London in its levelling up white paper. ACE currently spends £21 a head in London and an average of £6 a head in the rest of England. Organisations in more than 109 areas with historically low investment in arts and culture have been encouraged to bid for funding. These areas, referred to as “levelling up for culture places” have been identified based on levels of cultural engagement and spending The ACE chair, Sir Nicholas Serota, said the increase in funding would “enable more people in more places to reap the benefits of arts and culture and will accelerate our commitment to parts of the country that deserve more investment”. He added: “We will be able to do more to nurture new creative talent, support work that makes us healthier and happier, renew our high streets and, above all, ensure that everyone, everywhere has the opportunity of a rich cultural and creative life.” ACE said it had already been working to move money to other regions. Grant-in-aid investments outside London had risen from 40% to 60%, and national lottery investment had increased from 60% to 75%, it said. The announcement was welcomed by leaders of regional arts institutions. Chris Stafford, the chief executive of Leicester’s Curve theatre, said: “We believe everyone, irrespective of their circumstances, should have equal opportunity to engage with world-class culture and fulfil their creative potential. “We welcome the new Arts Council investment programme, which will see a greater balance of public investment across the country, ensuring no one is left behind.” Tony Butler, the executive director of Derby Museums, said being a national portfolio organisation (one that receives public funding) had “ensured that cultural heritage frames the future ambition of our city as a place of innovation and creativity”.

2/24/2022,"Two women are suing an Oklahoma hospital after a DNA test revealed that they were switched at birth nearly 60 years ago. Tinna Ennis and Jill Lopez have filed a lawsuit against the Duncan Regional hospital after an apparent mixup resulted in the women – then babies – being unknowingly taken home by each other’s parents in 1964.  The lawsuit, also filed by Kathryn Jones, who gave birth to Lopez but raised Ennis, is alleging recklessness and negligent infliction of emotional distress, according to the Daily Beast which first reported the story. In 2019, Ennis and her daughter decided to take an at-home DNA test from Ancestry.com in hopes of tracking down Ennis’s estranged maternal grandfather. However, rather than linking the mother and daughter to anyone in their extended family, the test results revealed numerous relatives with the last name Brister, all of whom the pair never heard of. Jones then took a test as well. To her surprise, the results did not show any familiar relatives and found zero connections to her daughter and granddaughter. Ennis’s daughter called Ancestry.com’s support line after Ennis assumed the mixup was a result of her not paying the website’s monthly fee. The customer representative told her that that was not the case and instead said, “You know, you find some interesting things on Ancestry,” according to Ennis. Ennis went on to track down Lopez in Lawton, Oklahoma, via social media. Lopez, who had been raised by the late Joyce and John Brister, agreed to take a test. According to the the Daily Beast, Lopez’s husband suspected Ennis to be a scammer, but Lopez did not. When Lopez’s results came back Ennis’s “heart just sank [in that moment]”, she recalled. “I just had to get my emotions straight for a while, because it’s a whole lot to get your mind around,” Lopez said upon discovering the results. “Like, you had a mom and I had a mom, and now I have a different mom.” Upon being told the results, Jones initially denied them, repeatedly affirming that Ennis was her daughter. However, after seeing a picture of Lopez, Jones said the first thing that came to mind was, “Where was I when that was taken?” and “I don’t remember those clothes.” “Because she actually looked just like me,” Jones went on to say. “And it devastated me.” According to her, “one of the low points of the whole thing” was the realization that Ennis’s children were also not biologically related to her. “I felt like I was losing my daughter and my grandchildren too,” Jones said. Ennis’s biological parents were the Bristers, who died many years ago before she got to meet them. She revealed that she sometimes feels a little jealous towards Lopez. “Jill got to be with my real parents, and now she gets to be with my parents I grew up with. I didn’t know what to think about it at first, but the more I think about it, it makes me really sad.” The hospital, which took over liability for Duncan Physicians and Surgeons Hospital after merging with several other hospitals in 1975, has denied the lawsuit’s allegations. The doctors involved in the births of Ennis and Lopez have died. The hospital’s attorneys argue that it is not the same entity as it was when the two women were allegedly switched at birth. Last month, the hospital asked to dismiss the lawsuit due to the changed entity but a judge denied the request.",News/US news,Women sue Oklahoma hospital after learning they were switched at birth in 1964,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/23/women-sue-oklahoma-hospital-dna-test-switched-at-birth
