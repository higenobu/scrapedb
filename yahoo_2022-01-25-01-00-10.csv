1/25/2022,"U.S. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick was sworn in as the first Black woman to represent the predominantly Democratic 20th District in Florida on Tuesday, but her Republican opponent she defeated by a landslide the week before, still has not conceded the race. Cherfilus-McCormick won the special election for the 20th District on Jan. 11, securing 78.7 percent of the vote over Jason Mariner’s 19.6 percent. However, Mariner won’t concede the election and has filed a lawsuit alleging ballot issues. Mariner pointed to media bias in election coverage the day after his defeat. “People are supposed to have a fair shake at choosing governance,” Mariner told reporters in a video posted on his campaign Facebook page. “That didn’t get that in this race because the media was so slanted and biased.” Cherfilus-McCormick fills the seat left vacant by the late Democratic U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings, who had held the seat since 2013. Hastings died of pancreatic cancer in April. Cherfilus-McCormick will serve the rest of Hastings’ term for the district that cover parts of Broward and Palm Beach Counties. Despite losing the election, Mariner posted a video the following day with a trio of Black voters vocalizing their support for him. “I’ve just begun to fight. Rock-N-Roll, America,” Mariner wrote in the caption. Mariner has received criticism from both sides for his refusal to concede. Some have compared Mariner’s move to fellow Republican former President Donald Trump’s resistance to his November 2020 loss to President Joe Biden. Although he conceded to Biden in Jan. 7, 2021, two months after the election and the day after the Capitol riot, he still claims that his reelection bid was stolen. Trump, the most influential figure in the Republican Party, claims the country’s voting system is “flawed.” Trump and his campaign and followers have filed over five dozen lawsuits challenging the election, hoping to overturn the results based on unfounded claims of voting fraud and inconsistencies. Since the elections, Republicans in several states have pushed legislation to address “election integrity.” A recent Washington Post report found that “at least 163 Republicans who have embraced Trump’s false claims are running for statewide positions that would give them authority over the administration of elections.” Mariner told reporters last Wednesday, “we’ll also have some stuff coming out that we’ve recently discovered,” but his campaign has not released further details. Cherfilus-McCormick’s win increases the Democrats’ advantage in the U.S. House to 222-212. She will have to fight for reelection again in the state’s August primary election. Mariner said last Wednesday he would be pursuing the seat again.

1/25/2022,"A 14-year-old dachshund named Sammy broke hearts on social media after a shelter revealed he was stubbornly waiting for the return of his owner who had died. Sammy was homeless and without prospects when someone dropped him off at the Monmouth County SPCA shelter in New Jersey. “All day he sits and stares out the glass waiting for his person to come,” the shelter wrote Jan. 21 on Facebook. “Every time someone passes by, his little head perks up but then lowers back down when he realizes it’s just a stranger.” The identity of his owner was not revealed, but shelter staff said it was an “elderly” person who recently died. Sammy’s best friend, a littermate, also died not long ago, adding to his sense of loss, the shelter said. A photo of Sammy staring out the window of the shelter was included with the Facebook post, which had 4,800 reactions and 1,500 comments as of Jan. 24. “This is gut wrenching,” Marci Wagner wrote on Facebook. “I couldn’t see thru my nonstop tears,” Tracy Valliant wrote. “My heart broke into pieces. I can’t imagine how broken his little heart & soul is,” Kerre Cloyes posted. The post was shared more than 3,000 times, mostly by people hoping to convince someone to adopt Sammy. It worked. The post went up around 11:30 a.m. Jan. 21 — and Sammy was adopted within about seven hours, the shelter said. The identity of Sammy’s new owner was not revealed, but photos of their meeting were posted online. “Thousands of comments and shares, hundreds of emails and messages — all for one special boy,” the shelter wrote. “We’re so glad that Sammy found his home, and all from your networking! Sweet Sammy is sleeping comfortably tonight with his new forever family, one that will help him remember what it’s like to be loved.” However, the shelter had a message for its thousands of followers. “We want to remind everyone about the animals whose posts don’t go viral in a few hours - they also need the same kind of rally we saw for Sammy,” the shelter wrote. “We encourage everyone to visit their local shelters and see which adoptable pets are waiting for homes — your perfect match could be waiting for you right this moment, and you’d never know!” Christmas miracle unfolds as expectant beagle couple meet a wise man along Ohio road 3 cats, 1 Vitamix blender box lead to epic struggle and a couple’s odd plea for help Man seen walking rooster on a leash in Ohio becomes overnight social media celebrity",U.S./State College Centre Daily Times,Dog breaks hearts while patiently waiting for return of owner who died in New Jersey,https://news.yahoo.com/dog-breaks-hearts-while-patiently-125035873.html
1/25/2022,"By Valerie Volcovici and Nichola Groom WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Around 30 oil and gas facilities across the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico spewed large amounts of methane for three years, emitting the equivalent climate pollution from half a million cars, according to a report released on Monday. The facilities, which include well pads, pipelines, compressor stations and processing facilities, were observed as ""persistently"" emitting large volumes of methane over the three years of aerial surveys done by the Environmental Defense Fund and research group Carbon Mapper. These so-called ""superemitters,"" located in the most productive U.S. oil field, only account for .001% of the Permian Basin's oil and gas infrastructure but emit around 100,000 tonnes of methane per year. This means that repairing those leaks offers companies an immediate opportunity to help achieve U.S. and international methane reduction targets and save around $26 million in escaped natural gas, the report said. ""The magnitude of emissions coming from a handful of methane sources in one of the top oil and gas producing regions illustrates the opportunity to make significant near-term progress toward the stated methane reduction goals of the US, other countries and companies around the world,"" said Riley Duren, CEO of Carbon Mapper and a researcher at University of Arizona. The report shows these large emission sources cut across a diverse range of infrastructure and oil and gas operators in the Permian Basin. Methane is the second-biggest cause of climate change after carbon dioxide. Its high heat-trapping potential and relatively short lifespan in the atmosphere means cutting its emissions can have an outsized impact on the trajectory of the world's climate. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last year proposed the first federal regulation targeting methane emissions from existing oil and gas facilities. It is taking public comment until the end of January and will introduce a supplemental proposal this spring outlining measures for routine flaring and smaller-sized wells. The United States also signed on to a voluntary global methane pledge with around 100 countries, agreeing to slash methane by 30% below 2020 levels in eight years. New Mexico, home to part of the Permian Basin, is finalizing its own rules in March that require companies to regularly monitor processing and production facilities.

1/25/2022,"It was in the spring of 1982 that 21-year-old Carl Stottor met the man who would destroy his life. Stottor had travelled to London from Blackpool a few months earlier, trying to forge a career as a drag artist. Like many young gay men of that era, he gravitated to the capital as a place of acceptance. Once there, he drank and partied amid the bright lights of Soho’s gay pubs and bars. One night in May, Stottor was in Camden’s Black Cap pub when a floppy-haired, rather austere-looking man walked over and offered him a drink. His name was Dennis Nilsen. When the pub closed, Nilsen invited Stottor back to his flat, a few miles away in Muswell Hill. They didn’t sleep together; the pair simply chatted until Stottor fell asleep. Stottor woke in the early hours, and realised with panic that Nilsen was trying to strangle him using the zip from his sleeping bag. He lost consciousness. When he woke up, Nilsen was holding his head under water in a bathtub. It’s unclear exactly what happened after that, but Nilsen at some point appears to have lost interest in murdering him. He let Stottor go, even walking him to the local Tube station. It wasn’t until a few years later that Stottor realised just how narrowly he’d escaped death. By that night in May 1982, Nilsen had already murdered 13 of the 15 young men he is thought to have killed between 1978 and 1983. He was Britain’s most prolific criminal, until Harold Shipman. It’s often said that Nilsen, a necrophile who worked at a job centre in Kentish Town, north London, preyed on vulnerable young men who lived at the margins of society. And there is some truth to that idea. Some of Nilsen’s victims were homeless; some had drug and addiction issues. But other victims came from loving families, with friends, jobs and connections. At the time of his encounter with Nilsen, Stottor was in the prime of his youth, with an exciting future ahead of him, full of thrilling theatrical performances and drag shows. But the memories of that night left Stottor with deep psychological scars, remembers his younger sister, Julie Bentley. His trauma would echo down the generations, affecting the lives of his younger relatives in ways he could never have predicted at the time – and in ways that Stottor, a “funny, talented, clever” man, never would have chosen. “He turned to alcohol to take away the pain, the guilt, the memories, the flashbacks,” says Julie, 48. She is speaking to me over the phone from her home in Hampshire. “I think he had PTSD. I’ve held him when he’s been crying, [unable] to get images out of his head.” Julie appears in a new three-part documentary, The Nilsen Files, starting on BBC Two on Monday January 24. Most accounts of Nilsen’s crimes – including the fictionalised ITV drama Des, released in 2020 – tend to focus on the murderer himself. Biographers obsess over the grisly details: Nilsen’s flat of horrors, where police found a pair of human legs in the bathroom; the murderer’s tendency during police interviews to crack bizarre jokes at his interrogators’ expense. These sort of ‘misery memoirs’ have come under fire by TV critics in recent years, accused of capitalising on the public’s morbid fascination with violence and death. Instead, the new BBC film tries to shift focus away from Nilsen and onto the victims and survivors. It also catalogues alleged errors by the police, who failed to take early reports about Nilsen seriously, and failed to join the dots between missing victims, according to the film’s director, Michael Ogden. Had they arrested the civil servant sooner, lives might have been saved. In the climate of 1980s homophobia, he says, victims were written off as promiscuous gay men with unsavoury lifestyles. “Because they went home with a gay man, they almost became guilty,” Ogden says. He thinks it’s hard not to see parallels with the case of Stephen Port, who murdered four gay men in Barking between 2014 and 2015, by giving them overdoses of the ‘date-rape’ drug GHB. Last month, an inquest jury ruled that failings by the Met Police contributed to the deaths of Port’s final three victims. Port’s crimes were depicted earlier this month in Four Lives, a BBC drama in which the serial killer was played by Stephen Merchant. Some time after his escape from Nilsen in 1982, Stottor went to the police. It’s not clear exactly when this happened, but his claims were dismissed without investigation. Detectives probably thought it was a “lover’s tiff”, says Ogden. Stottor told his family about what had happened in Nilsen’s house, but he wasn’t always believed. “He used to phone up at 2, 3am, going on about how someone had tried to kill him,” remembers Stottor’s younger brother, Paul. “He was drunk out of his head. We just brushed it off and hung up the phone. We thought he was making up stories.” It was not until February 1983 that Nilsen was finally arrested, when a neighbour spotted what looked like human remains in a drain outside his house. As he was driven away in a police car, Nilsen, speaking in a calm, confident manner, took it upon himself to confess, bragging that he had killed “15 or 16 since 1978” (though only seven were identified). In an interview, he told police how he had allowed one man to escape. He gave intricate details, describing how he strangled the man and then held his head under his bathtub, allowing his dog to lick him. Those details chimed precisely with Stottor’s claims, according to Detective Sergeant Chris Healey, who worked on the investigation. Police shared the news with Stottor. Finally, his family realised he hadn’t been lying. “My mum sat and cried, because she didn’t believe it originally,” remembers Bentley. Stottor gave evidence at Nilsen’s trial at the Old Bailey, one of three survivors to do so. His voice quivered with emotion as he recounted the strangulation, the bathtub, how he pleaded for his life to be spared. Nilsen was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 25 years, which was increased in 1994 to a whole-life tariff. He died from complications following stomach surgery in 2018, aged 72. After the trial, Stottor tried to move on with his life, embracing his 20s as a young, confident gay man. Bentley was a teenager at this point, living with her mother in Buckinghamshire. She idolised her cool, adventurous older brother. When visiting home, Stottor would dress her as Madonna, plastering her face in make-up. When she was about 18, she travelled with her friends to Blackpool to watch his residency as a drag queen performer. “He was absolutely amazing,” she recalls. He continued working as a drag performer for much of his life. But beneath his confident surface, memories of Nilsen were always there. “If he started having a few drinks, he would then start crying and it would flash back in to him. As the years went by he became an alcoholic, because he started relying on alcohol to dull the pain. Once every couple of months he would ring us up and talk about what happened. He was Jekyll and Hyde; there’d be crying and shouting. He would tell Mum he loved her, then say: ‘You’re the worst mother in the world.’” It drove him apart from his family. When Bentley had her own children, she stopped answering Stottor’s calls. “I didn’t want to put my children through those two, three o’clock phone calls.” In his later years he lived in Brighton as a drag performer. He died alone in his flat in 2013 of complications related to ketoacidosis (a diabetic coma). He was dead for a week before his body was found. Bentley received the bad news in a call from the police – on her birthday. “I broke down. Guilt came into it because he was on his own,” she says. Tragically, the echoes of Nilsen’s crimes did not stop there. Four years ago, Bentley’s eldest son took his own life, aged 19, after suffering from depression. “In his letter he said he didn’t want to do to me what Uncle Carl did to Nanny. He didn’t want to be a burden on me.” Trauma “trickles down”, she says. “Carl never got support to combat it. It’s like a pebble in a pond – those ripples reach out.” Bentley is grateful that Stottor’s story is now being told in Ogden’s BBC film. It’s the first time an account of Nilsen’s crimes will focus on the victims, she thinks, rather than on the grisly crimes of the perpetrator. Now, Bentley tries not to think about Nilsen. She thinks instead about her brother’s dancing, his uproarious sense of humour, his incredible capacity for fun. “I focus on the happy things,” she says. “If I speak about Carl, I smile.” The Nilsen Files is on BBC Two at 9pm on Monday January 24",World/The Telegraph,My brother escaped Dennis Nilsen but he still destroyed his life,https://news.yahoo.com/brother-escaped-dennis-nilsen-still-105102638.html
1/25/2022,"Scientists worldwide are closely tracking an Omicron subtype, called BA.2. In Denmark BA.2 is surpassing the BA.1 Omicron subtype, the most common cause of new COVID-19 cases. It's not yet clear if BA.2 will be more severe or contagious than BA.1. Health officials and scientists worldwide are closely watching a subtype of the highly infectious Omicron COVID-19 variant. The new subtype, called BA.2, is a sister to BA.1 — the virus driving most COVID-19 cases worldwide. Scientists have spotted that the number of people infected with BA.2 has steadily increased in several countries including India, the UK, Sweden, and Singapore. It was first detected in the Philippines in December 2021. This could signal BA.2 is more infectious than BA.1, though there isn't enough data yet to determine any meaningful difference between the two, experts have said. Scientists worldwide are now scrambling to work out if current vaccines will still work on the subtype, and whether BA.2 is more deadly. In Denmark, BA.2 has displaced BA.1 and now accounts for almost half of the new infections in the country, health officials said Thursday. Early data from the country suggests there hasn't been an uptick in hospitalizations since the subtype took hold. Dr Tom Peacock, a researcher at Imperial College London, who was one of the first to sound the alarm about Omicron in November, said on Twitter Friday that BA.2 probably wouldn't cause a a second Omicron wave: ""I think the likely scenario is BA.2 just exacerbates what the national Omicron situation is (slows down decreases, increases peaks, etc)."" Peacock said that the subtype was not a ""major cause of concern"", but ""definitely worth keeping an eye on,"" per the Financial Times. Omicron comprises three viruses: BA.1, BA.2 and BA.3. The BA.1. and BA.2 sister viruses share common mutations, but there are about 50 that differ between either subtype, Peacock said Sunday. Francois Balloux, director at the University College London Genetics Institute said in a statement to the Science Media Center Monday that the two Omicron sub-lineages were sisters that split from each other several months ago, and were not derived from each other. Scientists have previously warned that BA.2. is a bit harder to track in lab tests than BA.1 due to mutations in the part of the virus that attaches to cells. As of Monday, the BA.2 Omicron subtype had been detected in 10,811 sequenced tests from 49 countries and 17 US states, according to Scripps University's Outbreak.info. Outbreak.info pulls data from a well-regarded central database called the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data, or GISAID. Countries with more than 100 BA.2 cases include: Denmark (8,357), India (711), the UK (607), Sweden (224), and Singapore (203). But as a percentage of cases overall, it remains low. For example, BA.2 accounts for about 0.03% of all tests sequenced in the UK, according to Outbreak info. UK health officials labeled BA.2 a ""variant under investigation"" on Friday. This essentially means UK officials are concerned about its mutations, but it hasn't yet been determined whether the subtype is more deadly, more infectious or better able to evade vaccines. The UK Health and Security Agency said Friday that their decision was based on ""small but increasing numbers"" of the virus in the country and its spread internationally. ""There is still uncertainty around the significance of the changes to the viral genome, and further analyses will now be undertaken,"" it said. ""It is the nature of viruses to evolve and mutate, so it's to be expected that we will continue to see new variants emerge as the pandemic goes on,"" Dr Meera Chand, UKHSA COVID-19 incident director, said.
