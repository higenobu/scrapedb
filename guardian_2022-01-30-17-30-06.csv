1/30/2022,"For a true chilli-head like me, it’s so exciting to see how the selection has absolutely exploded in recent years, from often just a single variety as a novelty, to literally hundreds on offer from across the planet. The nature of catalogues, however, where eye-catching photography is key to the sale, is that often the heavily promoted varieties have been chosen for their photogenic quality – for their quirky shapes and colours – rather than for non-visual characteristics, such as actual good flavour. Indeed, having personally run taste tests on hundreds of chilli varieties over the years, it does seem to me that many have been actively bred exclusively for their ornamental appeal. So if you are looking for amazing flavour, here are three that really stand out from the crowd.  Ají limón, meaning “lemon chilli”, is a traditional variety essential to a whole range of Peruvian dishes, which I fell in love with while researching my master’s thesis in rural South America. With a bright, fruity flavour – as the name and intense yellow colour suggest – this variety is indeed surprisingly lemony, somehow providing spice and citrus in equal measure. They really are one of those keystone ingredients whose flavour is simply unsubstitutable. Despite the delicious fruit being incredibly hard to track down in the UK, the seeds are common in catalogues, re-branded under the English name ‘Lemon Drop’. Further south comes a totally different species of chilli from the tiny handful from which all other varieties descend – the Rocoto (Capsicum pubescens). Believed to originally hail from Argentina and Bolivia, this is the most cool-weather-tolerant species, producing square fruit that look like regular red or green peppers. They have an intense fieriness combined with unique, grassy, melon-cucumber notes, which explains why my Latin friends from all over the UK will make long trips to buy frozen ones in speciality stores in London. They’re incredible if you eat them stuffed (if you can handle their heat) and they tolerate our cooler climate well. Finally, let’s not forget Brazil, with it’s spectacular Biquinho. These are small, bright red, cherry-sized chillies with a medium spice level, matched by an incredible tropical fruit flavour. Think of a habanero chilli with the spice level dialled right down. They are traditionally served pickled whole in a sweetened vinegar, sometimes laced with the Brazilian sugarcane spirit cachaça. I think of them as a sort of a savoury maraschino cherry that works pure magic on cheese and cured meat. Now I know I am not supposed to focus on appearance here, but their teardrop shape, ending in a pointy tip, (biquinho means “little beak”) adds to the whole eating experience. The best thing about chillies is that a little goes a long way – in the kitchen and garden. Even if you only have a small spare corner of your greenhouse, or sheltered spot on a sunny patio, having a few of these plants can transform your dishes. Pick one of these unusually flavourful ones and thank me later in the year.

1/30/2022,"Australia and England engineered a grandstand finish to the Ashes Test in Canberra, as England nearly ran down the biggest fourth-innings chase in women’s Test history before a collapse left them scrambling to survive at nine wickets down. The gap between the teams in the end was 11 runs, with the last-gasp draw leaving Australia leading the multi-format series on points 6-4. Those dramatic final hours came after losing most of the third day to rain, encouraging Australian captain Meg Lanning on the fourth and final day to declare at 216 for seven late in the second session. Lanning set England 257 to win from 48 overs, an equation that should have been relatively straightforward for Australia to protect against tired players on a wearing pitch with no fielding restrictions.  But England launched into that chase like it was a one-day international, Tammy Beaumont making the early running with 36 from 42 balls, before Lauren Winfield-Hill started stepping down the pitch to take on the bowling and make 33. England made 52 for the opening stand and 42 for the second wicket, before captain Heather Knight combined with vice-captain Natalie Sciver for the major partnership of the day. Knight’s epic 168 not out in the first innings had her team in the match, and she added another 48 in even time in the second innings, driving crisply through the covers despite suffering leg cramps. Sciver climbed into a series of pull shots to keep the score racing alone. At one stage they had reduced the required total to 91 from 90 deliveries, and looked the goods to get them. Lanning, meanwhile, was vacillating, sometimes with six fielders on the boundary, sometimes with three. Australia looked to have no idea where help might come from. It was teenage quick Darcie Brown who delivered it, crashing into Knight’s front pad for an lbw decision that was upheld on review. Sophia Dunkley was given out the same way the very next ball, but her review showed the ball clearing the bails by a hair’s breadth. Dunkley made the most of her reprieve, battering 45 from 32 balls, including a couple of sixes from Sutherland, while Sciver ploughed on. The required target dropped to 53 off 66. But Sutherland slowed the rush by bowling around the wicket, warned for negative bowling down the leg side, before resorting to high bouncers that Dunkley couldn’t hit. Then the leg-spinner Alana King bowled an over conceding one run to Sciver. Needing 44 from 54 balls, Sciver took on Sutherland with the pull shot again and was well caught by Lanning at midwicket for 58. Wicketkeeper Amy Jones only had to find singles for Dunkley, but instead slogged across the line at Sutherland for Mooney to take an even better catch diving forward at deep midwicket, broken jaw and all. England’s lower order kept swinging, needing 24 runs from 28 balls, but Katherine Brunt was caught behind, Anya Shrubsole was run out, and Charlie Dean top-edged a sweep shot. King on debut and Sutherland in her second Test were nerveless. When the ninth wicket fell with 13 balls to go, last pair Kate Cross and Sophie Ecclestone blocked out the rest. Australia will have things to look at in the post-mortem. Across a declaration-setting innings, their batting went at 3.38 per over. Tahlia McGrath, who lit up the first T20 with her 91 from 49 balls, walked out on the fourth morning with the game set up for a finisher and made 34 from 67. Only Ashleigh Gardner’s run-a-ball 38 and Jess Jonassen’s 14 from six balls adhered to the brief of fast runs to push the chance of a result. Regardless of how England attacked the target, there was a lack of boldness in Australia choosing only 48 overs to bowl. All of which must be seen within the constraints of a four-day Test, where any time lost to rain severely affects the integrity of a contest. The finish that will be replayed and feted relied on both captains and both teams being willing to take a punt. Ideally Tests in the future won’t need such interventions, if they are played over five days as the men’s matches are. This episode underlines again how good the format can be.",Sport/Sport,Australia close on Women’s Ashes after England hold on for draw in Test thriller,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/30/australia-close-on-womens-ashes-after-england-hold-on-for-draw-in-test-thriller
1/30/2022,"British capitalism is in trouble. The UK stock market, populated by too many legacy companies with scarcely a major hi-tech company in sight, has been the worst performing among advanced countries since 2000. Brexit has deepened the crisis. Our companies, vulnerably cheap by international standards, have become easy prey for takeover merchants from all over the globe who are rarely benign stewards. Too few great new companies are coming through to take their place. Yet, by the criteria of the political right, the UK should be a capitalist beacon. Regulation in Britain – from the world of work to product standards – is light, applied weakly and is too often close to non-existent. Companies and capital are taxed modestly by international standards. But, stubbornly, the growth rate shrinks as investment and productivity stagnate. Could it be, pray, that the dominant rightwing intellectual paradigm is wrong?  Endlessly inventive, the right has found a convenient new villain to blame – “woke” or “stakeholder” capitalism. It may be that the woeful economic trends are longstanding and deep-seated, but don’t let that get in the way of a good new culture war. Last week, the Adam Smith Institute crystallised the complaint in a paper, Capitalism After Covid, which added stakeholder capitalism to the state as culprits in chief. Governments, intoned author Matthew Lesh, have failed in their pandemic response while the private sector has done brilliantly. This “state failure” removes the case for more government involvement in the economy, post-Covid. Instead, capitalism must be given its head, but not a woke capitalism that “stabs itself in the face” by wanting to address “racial justice or environmental protection”. Capitalism must ruthlessly put profit and shareholders first, which is its sacred duty, not sacrifice profit to appease stakeholders in the trivial search for good headlines – the road to perdition. Too many companies are following woke Unilever and sacrificing profit and performance for lofty talk of pursuing sustainability and social purpose, personified, said a leading critical investor, Terry Smith, by trying to argue that the purpose of Hellmann’s mayonnaise was to further healthy eating. Lesh won kind headlines in the Mail. But his thinking is fossilised in the 1980s and singularly fails to address today’s facts and arguments. Has state failure been so complete? Opinion in 27 countries has become more trusting of state competence in handling the pandemic, according to Cambridge’s Centre for the Future of Democracy. In pandemics, you need collective action and state leadership. Yes, there have been weaknesses – but offset by astonishing successes. In Britain, for example, the speed at developing and rolling out vaccines was because of smart collaboration between clever public procurement, universities, notably Oxford, the NHS and purpose-driven companies such as AstraZeneca. Equally, economics is wrestling with the gaping shortcomings of the simple free market views that Lesh champions. Not least, as the 2021 winter edition of the Oxford Review of Economic Policy asks: “Capitalism – what has gone wrong, what needs to change and how can it be fixed?” Radical uncertainty besets economic decision-making; we need better designed institutions to win the gains from cooperation and individuals are much more complicated than economic automata responding to price signals. Economic models that ignore all this (such as Lesh’s) argue successive contributors, lead to a degraded capitalism, stagnating living standards and rising populism in response. Witness Britain in 2022. Companies shape and are shaped by the society of which they are part and this includes the evolving preferences of shareholders. The Investment Association annual 2021 review reports that 49% of the £9.4tn of investment funds under UK management are pledged to promote the environment, social cohesion and good governance (ESG in the jargon), reflecting the wishes of their millions of savers. Founded in the 1880s, Unilever’s purpose was “to make cleanliness commonplace and lessen the load for women”. Today’s investors want it to continue with an updated purpose – making “sustainable living commonplace”, the principle reason it is a great company. Unilever, and the growing number of companies like it, are only responding to their shareholders’ priorities. McKinsey Global Institute declares that stakeholder capitalism, in which companies carefully manage the trade-offs between their varying stakeholders, is the key to long-term value creation. It is the future of business. This is not a sacrifice of profit in woke appeasement of useless consumers, employees and wider societal pressures, as Lesh characterises it. Stakeholder capitalism is a recognition that any company is a social organisation that needs engaged workforces, loyal customers, supportive shareholders and strong brands, all of whose claims have to be managed, alongside financial priorities. Mock the idea that Hellmann’s mayonnaise has a purpose, but consumers care about the health of what they eat and will do more in future. Purposed brands, as Unilever’s own data shows, outperform their non-purposed rivals. And that means profit. Are companies good enough at explaining these realities and trade-offs, at explaining why they consider what they are doing is so material to their long-term profitability and why they feel compelled not to ignore climate change or Black Lives Matter? Lesh attacks the entire framework without recognising the huge current debates about how stakeholder companies and their investors can do better. Companies are asking how they can better explain to their shareholders their best guess of future trends and explain why engaging workforces and customers is so worthwhile. Investors are becoming better at calling out greenwashing and soft corporate baloney. It’s called “materiality”, to borrow the buzzword of the hour – think relevance, significance. Ignore these material pressures beyond immediate financial demands and companies get into profound trouble. British capitalism suffers from a long history of making easy money through being the first to industrialise and possessing a global empire. As a result, the culture of innovative risk-taking and the institutions to support it, along with a sophisticated conception of the company, are cruelly under-developed, as Adam Smith would have been the first to recognise. The value of the institute that proselytises in his name is that it is a useful fool, setting out so revealingly why its 1980s thinking is so wrong. And why so many in business, investment and academia are right to figure out new ways to reset capitalism and better capture its undoubted dynamism to serve the common good.

1/30/2022,"Have the Winter Olympics caught you cold? Just like the Jamaican bobsleigh team (their first appearance since 1998) the Games are back as the biggest global stars on snow and ice descend on Beijing in pursuit of all things gold, silver and bronze. The timings are not the most sociable for viewers in the UK – with most days’ events starting about midnight and finishing about 3pm – but there is a lot to get excited about. Here’s our armchair guide on what to follow, when and why snowboard cross might be your new favourite sport.  The opening ceremony is a Friday night affair on 4 February, with 3,000 performers and Beijing 2022 organisers promising a cauldron-lighting that is “unprecedented in the over 100-year history of the Olympic Games” at the National Stadium, affectionately known as the Bird’s Nest. However, events will start before the opening ceremony, with curling and luge kicking things off on Wednesday, before Alpine skiing, freestyle skiing and ice hockey (including a huge women’s match between the defending Olympic champions, the USA, and the world No 3s, Finland) get going on Thursday. Team GB has 50 fully vaccinated athletes – nine shy of the 2018 total – with the speed skater Ellia Smeding given the final berth last week. All are expected to follow strict Covid protocols: they have to to stay and eat in designated locations and have been instructed to minimise hugs, high-fives and handshakes at all times, although commemorative condoms in their hotel rooms suggest authorities are anticipating some rule-breaking. In slightly less tantalising developments, the GB athletes have been offered temporary mobile phones because of fears they could be spied on by the Chinese government. Britain has joined the USA, Australia, New Zealand and Canada in refusing to send any official diplomats over China’s record of human rights abuses. Seven, which would surpass the record haul of five, won at Sochi 2014 and Pyeongchang 2018. “British athletes have the potential to win between three and seven medals at the Olympics, and between five and nine medals at the Paralympics,” said UK Sport’s chief executive, Sally Munday. The first opportunity for GB medals will most likely come on 8 February, day four of the Games, when the Scottish curlers (and childhood friends) Jen Dodds and Bruce Mouat will attempt to turn their world mixed doubles title into some Olympic hardware. Izzy Atkin will also be in the mix for a medal in the first Olympic women’s freeski big air final. Dave Ryding, a 35-year-old from Chorley in Lancashire, became the first British skier to win a gold medal in the 55-year history of the Alpine World Cup last week and he will go for men’s slalom gold on 16 February. But the reigning snowboard cross world champion, Charlotte Bankes, and the Sochi 2014 freestyle skiing silver medallist, Gus Kenworthy, are GB’s best hopes, after defecting from France and USA respectively. The American skier Mikaela Shiffrin, a double Olympic gold medallist, is set for a showdown with her Slovakian rival Petra Vlhova in the women’s slalom on 9 February. A similar battle will commence on the figure-skating rink between Japan’s Yuzuru Hanyu and USA’s Nathan Chen. The pair are fierce rivals: Hanyu has said he is planning to attempt the hallowed quad axel jump in Beijing, while Yale student Chen is hoping to sneak the gold before preparing for his exams in May.

1/30/2022,"Republican state lawmakers across the United States have proposed – and in some cases passed – legislation that they say keeps the government from interfering with doctors who want to prescribe ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine to help prevent and treat Covid-19.  But those treatments have not proven effective at preventing or treating Covid and infectious disease experts see the bills as examples of right-wing lawmakers politicizing medicine – a trend that is increasing as the pandemic wears on in America in to its third year amid an increasingly fraught political atmosphere. And so it goes with the latest suspect Covid-19 treatment that has become about more than just a drug, but rather about whether to trust established public health organizations or doctors who stray from their guidelines, and podcast and cable news hosts. “We really need to have the politicians step aside and let scientists and public health officials make the decisions on what is going to be beneficial in preventing and treating Covid,” said Sunil Parikh, an associate professor of epidemiology and infectious diseases at the Yale School of Public Health. Kansas is one of at least 11 states, according to Buzzfeed, where Republican lawmakers have proposed, and in some cases passed, legislation to limit medical licensing boards’ ability to take action against providers who prescribe ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, another drug that has not been shown to be effective against Covid but nevertheless promoted by some politicians on the right. “We are leaving it up to medical professionals like it should be, not bureaucrats trying to maintain a single message,” said Kansas state Senator Richard Hilderbrand, the chair of the committee that sponsored the legislation. The Kansas bill requires a pharmacist to dispense a prescription for hydroxychloroquine sulfate and ivermectin and states that it protects pharmacists or prescribers from liability for prescribing the drugs for Covid-19. Hilderbrand said he introduced the bill in part because the Kansas Board of Healing Arts was going after doctors for prescribing medication for off-label use. Fellow Republican state Senator Mark Steffen, an anesthesiologist and pain-management specialist, disclosed during a recent hearing that the board had been investigating him more than 18 months over comments he made while serving as a county commissioner, according to the Washington Post. Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic treatment mainly used for animals but approved in different doses to treat some parasitic worms in humans – but not for preventing or treating Covid. In addition to Republican lawmakers, promotion of ivermectin has come from public figures such as comedian and podcast host Joe Rogan, who said he used the drug to treat himself when he became sick with Covid, and Fox News hosts Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham. But Parikh said there have been no trials that “in most scientists’ minds show any evidence of ivermectin being beneficial” for the prevention or treatment of Covid. “The drug doesn’t work against Covid – full stop,” said Dr Michael Saag, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. “There are countless studies – randomized, well-conducted clinical trials – that show no benefit, so why would you want to use a drug that doesn’t work?” Regardless of ivermectin’s efficacy against Covid, Saag said legislation such as the bill in Kansas is unnecessary because doctors can still prescribe it for off-label use, even if it doesn’t work. “Any physician in the United States has the ability to write a prescription of a drug for a purpose that has not been formally approved by the FDA,” Saag explained. Steven Stites, the chief medical officer of the University of Kansas Health System, sees legislation in Kansas as problematic not only because it provides doctors authority they already have, but because it removes providers and pharmacists from liability for prescribing or dispensing hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin. “You have taken the risk away from the doctor. You have taken the risk away from the pharmacist, so that means the two people who are completely trained for this type of question have now had their risk removed, so the patient holds the risk,” said Stites. “The least informed, least trained person in the room now holds all the risk.” Hilderbrand, the Kansas state senator, said lawmakers planned to remove the language in the legislation that shields doctors from liability and the portion that requires pharmacists to fill prescriptions for the drugs. When asked about the assessment that the drug has not been proven effective against Covid and could be dangerous, Hilderbrand said, “where is their evidence that it doesn’t” work? “If the doctor and patient think that is the best course of action on a novel virus, then they should have that opportunity,” said Hilderbrand, who represents a district in southeastern Kansas. There are ongoing studies of ivermectin’s ability to treat Covid at the University of Minnesota and Duke University. Parikh, said he hopes studies demonstrate that ivermectin can be effective with Covid, “but we have not seen that”. He also points out that there are new treatments that have proven effective in treating Covid, like Paxlovid. What does he expect to happen if the trials at Minnesota and Duke show that ivermectin is not effective against Covid? “If these studies were done well”, Parikh said, “and really do show in these settings that ivermectin is not impactful … I just can’t see any reason to continue this debate.”",News/US news,Concern as Republicans push to make dubious Covid cure prescriptions easier,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/30/republican-lawmakers-ivermectin-hydroxychloroquine-covid-treatment

1/30/2022,"Offering yet further proof that the future of cutting-edge horror is female, British actor turned writer-director Romola Garai’s impressive feature debut, which won enthusiastic applause at FrightFest last year, is a moody, brooding chiller that goes from slow-boil creaks to rapturous, hallucinogenic madness. Set largely in a decrepit building whose mouldy walls mirror a creeping moral malaise within, Amulet plays adventurously with subversive sexual politics and reconfigured horror tropes, conjuring a heady parable rich in ritual and intrigue, built upon sturdy subtextual foundations.  The Romanian actor Alec Secareanu, who proved such an engaging screen presence in Francis Lee’s God’s Own Country, is Tomaz, an ex-soldier from an unnamed, conflict-torn country, now struggling to survive in squalid London. In his dreams, Tomaz is haunted by fable-like visions of the past: unearthing an amulet while stationed in a remote forest; meeting a fleeing woman who collapses in desperation; taking her in, giving her shelter and promising to help reunite her with her daughter. Meanwhile, in the destitute present, Tomaz meets Sister Claire (Imelda Staunton), who offers refuge in return for his help repairing a dilapidated house. Here, Magda (Carla Juri) cares for her invalid mother, who dwells “on the top floor”, a groaning figure living in the shadows beneath the roof, evoking the Victorian-gothic spectre of Jane Eyre and the paranoid psychodrama of Andrzej Żuławksi’s unhinged 1981 masterpiece Possession. Garai says that inspiration for Amulet came from reading about how the perpetrators of war atrocities would mentally “recategorise” their crimes when returning to civilian life, making normal that which was clearly aberrant. In Amulet, the blurring of perceptual lines between aggressors and protectors is a recurrent motif, leaving the audience constantly uncertain as to how to react to each of its three central characters, all of whom have their secrets. The casting of Secareanu is particularly astute. His expressively melancholy face draws us into Tomaz’s traumatised world, his lonely visage in sharp contrast to the almost sardonically sincere expressions of Staunton’s sinisterly smiling nun. As for Juri, she carries herself in a manner that flits from childlike innocence to something altogether more edgy. A scene in which Tomaz takes Magda dancing reminded me of a memorably disturbing interlude from Rose Glass’s Saint Maud. Like the housebound horrors of Jennifer Kent’s The Babadook and Babak Anvari’s Under the Shadow, Amulet traps its central characters in an enclosed location in which they must confront their deepest fears and most guilty secrets. Interestingly, Garai cites the films of Ben Wheatley and Peter Strickland as stylistic touchstones, a connection that chimes with her own intertwining of the domestic and the demonic, everyday reality and otherworldly ritual. Cinematographer Laura Bellingham, who did such atmospheric work on Corinna Faith’s hospital-based horror The Power, works wonders within the confines of the Victorian pile in which the story plays out, aided by the carefully colour-coded production design of Francesca Massariol, whose impressive CV includes Deborah Haywood’s Pin Cushion and Bassam Tariq’s Mogul Mowgli. Garai clearly has a fondness for the physical special effects of David Cronenberg body-horror classics such as Shivers and The Brood, lending a tangible oomph to the film’s occasional jump scares (an encounter with something horrible in the bathroom gave me a genuine start) and injecting a much-needed element of solidity into the impressively bizarre finale – a head-scrambling amalgam of the nightmarish weirdness of David Lynch’s Eraserhead and the trippy existential ecstasy of Ken Russell’s Altered States. A terrific score by feature first-timer (and renowned theremin player) Sarah Angliss completes the picture, mixing sampled Renaissance instruments with women’s voices that draw upon “the wails of female Scandinavian herders” (yes, really) to create a soundscape that seems alien and familiar. Working in close harmony, Angliss and sound designer Nick Baldock mirror the architecture of this sometimes jaw-dropping story, turning the house into a character with its own distinctive pulse, and ensuring that the audience’s collective heartbeat is cranked up a notch.",Arts/Film,Amulet review – Romola Garai’s room at the top holds untold horrors ,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/30/amulet-review-romola-garais-room-at-the-top-holds-untold-horrors
1/30/2022,"There can’t be many things more cheering on a dark January night than having to tell someone they’ve won a prize, and when I telephone Astrid Goldsmith to give her just such a bit of good news, her reaction is everything I hoped it would be. For a while, Goldsmith, an animator who lives in Folkestone where she makes stop-motion films in her garage, struggles to speak in full sentences. She is just so thrilled. “That is the greatest compliment,” she says, when I tell her that her story, A Funeral in Freiburg, the winner of this year’s Observer/Jonathan Cape graphic short story prize, brings to mind the work of that genius Posy Simmonds. “I love her tone. I always have.” Goldsmith’s entry is based on a real event: the funeral of her paternal grandmother in Germany in 2015. “The outrage had been percolating for a while,” she says, with a laugh. “But I only came to write it after my first baby was born, while I was breastfeeding: I drew it all on one of those trays with arms that invalids use in bed.” Her story revolves around the difficulties involved in organising a Jewish funeral service in a place – Freiburg, in the Black Forest – where the rabbi has been imprisoned for embezzlement, and the Jewish cemetery is full. The woman in charge is, very difficult, refusing even to believe that Gisela Goldschmidt was really Jewish (at the age of 18, Astrid’s grandmother fled Germany for Zimbabwe, only returning after the war was over). Her rules and regulations, not to mention her insistence on the performance of certain rituals, infuriate the Goldsmith family. But what choice do they have? It is a case of her way, or no proper funeral at all.  Our regular judges – Dan Franklin, the publisher of Jonathan Cape’s graphic novel list, Suzanne Dean, the creative director of Vintage, Paul Gravett, who runs the Comica festival, and yours truly – were joined this year by Alison Bechdel, the acclaimed author of (among other graphic novels) Fun Home, and by Samira Ahmed, the journalist and presenter of BBC Radio 4’s Front Row. Our decision was unanimous. Goldsmith’s rich, funny, plangent story isn’t only beautifully drawn; its subject, though highly particular, also has a universality that speaks to the past two years, a period during which too many of us have had to organise funerals at a distance. “It is weird,” says Goldsmith, who studied for an MA in animation at Norwich art school, and has worked in it ever since. “Death is so raw and emotional, and yet you’re also greeted with this bureaucracy. If you’re lucky, the people helping you through will be great. But our experience really wasn’t; when we went back to Germany for the stone setting a year later, it was just as bad.” There is, she says, a lot more to be said about the whole experience, and her hope now is to make A Funeral in Freiburg the beginning of a full length novel: “After someone dies, there’s so much bad behaviour, however good people’s intentions. It fell to me and my dad to drive to Germany to remove everything from my grandmother’s flat and distribute it to her family – and either everyone wanted something, or no one did.” Animation and the writing of a graphic novel are, she thinks, pretty similar in that they’re both extremely labour intensive. “But this is the first piece I’ve made that is truly personal,” she says. It captures something that is quite complicated: the territory that lies between a secular upbringing and a Jewish identity, and how the two might (or might not, in the case of A Funeral in Freiburg) fit together. The standard of the entries this year was very high – though it was striking how many of the stories had to do with anxiety, isolation and a longing for travel; the pandemic finds its way everywhere – and for this reason, we decided to anoint two runners-up. We loved Tat Effby’s Cancer Sells!, an uproarious satire on publishing’s obsession with illness memoirs (and reality stars) that for Samira Ahmed brought to mind the work of the late, great French cartoonist Claire Bretécher; and there was a lot of admiration, too, for A Wolfgang Crowe’s mournful and disquieting story, Andrew, a story of two loners that is clearly (and wonderfully) influenced by Daniel Clowes. Congratulations to both of them, too.",Arts/Books,‘The outrage had been percolating…’ The winner of our graphic short story prize 2021,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/30/the-outrage-had-been-percolating-the-winner-of-our-graphic-short-story-prize-2021

1/30/2022,"George Ezra walks into the Old Barge, the Hertford pub that’s been his lifelong local, and within three minutes his song, Budapest is on the stereo. “They’re so supportive here,” he says, with shy gratitude, as he stoops under a curtain into a back room. Ezra first came here after school, searching for a loo. At 16, he started working behind the bar. When friends come home for Christmas, this is where they meet, “and where we would have always met”. It still smells the same. (Currently: of yesterday’s log fire, a comforting contrast to the January damp.) Over the next few hours, locals stick their heads in to wave hello to their friendly neighbourhood pop star, drinking lime cordial and soda in crisp double denim, and he greets them all back by name. This is the approachable figure Ezra, who is 28, cuts in most settings, whether playing a radiant set at Glastonbury or warmly chatting about mental health on his podcast. A music college dropout born George Ezra Barnett, he emerged in 2014 as part of a cohort of middle-class British boys with acoustic guitars. Unlike most of them, he wasn’t lachrymose or ambition-crazed. Instead he had a good-weird sense of humour and a big voice, cultivated after this ardent blues fan became obsessed with the US blues singer Lead Belly.  Ezra’s label sent him Interrailing to inspire his first album, Wanted on Voyage, and he famously saw much of Europe except Budapest, the name of his breakthrough single. That song set the George Ezra template: primary-coloured bonhomie, a yearning for escape, an awed insistence that he’d give up anything for a girl. For album two, Staying at Tamara’s, he Airbnb’d in Barcelona and came back with the rabidly catchy singles Shotgun and Paradise. Both of his albums hit No 1 and spent 336 weeks in the charts (and counting) between them: rare numbers that put you in the Sheeran leagues. Having always used trips as creative inspiration, Ezra intended to write album three as he walked from Land’s End to John o’Groats in the spring of 2020. Instead, he spent five weeks of lockdown alone in London before family and friends convinced him to move back to Hertfordshire. For two months, during that mood-spiking heatwave, he lived in a van on a friend’s farm. “It was dogs that needed walking and fields that needed mowing,” he remembers dreamily. He soon bought his own place. Being back has done him the world of good. He loves community: “When you can walk out your front door and the whole town feels like an extension of a back garden.” And though he knows this might seem weird – regressive or stuck – “I feel comfortable in the fact that I’ve moved on, and then some.” Ezra says change is beautiful, and it suits him. His strong features sit more comfortably on a man’s face. When his hair grew out during lockdown, he swept it back and realised this was his look. (He has laughably nice skin, another recent change: “I started washing! I said to my sister, ‘Washing your skin really makes a difference doesn’t it?’ She was like, ‘Fuck off, yes.’”) On his first two albums, he often sang about escaping and giving it all up; the transformations on his lovely third album, Gold Rush Kid, are less about tearing up the script than recognising a moment as it’s happening, and discovering contentment within it. It’s a steadier album, he says. The first time around, he relied on his travels for something to write about. Second time, he had seen the world – played New Year’s Eve in Tasmania – “and so then writing about crocodiles and dreaming becomes quite realistic”. This time, he says, it felt “honest and cool” to write about the everyday substance of his life: assignations in hotel rooms and bars, surrendering to a lover’s beauty on the dancefloor. On the big-chorused title track, he sings of “robbing the bank / Making a run for it and learning to dance” – winging it, basically. He had been thinking about the opportunists who rushed west in the 1850s and “understood it as people deciding: over there is something worth pursuing and it’s finite, so go and get it”. Ezra writes to reinforce the things he needs to hear and he has realised that this is the attitude he wants to cultivate towards his career and his life: “Remember: enjoy this.” It is odd to hear that George Ezra – who wrote the lyric “bikini bottoms, lager tops, I could get used to this”, and sang it with a giddy whoop – needed that nudge. But his earlier, bright exterior concealed a bleak mindset. “In the past, when I’ve been the most intimidated and the most scared, it was really easy to tip over into nihilism and go, ‘Fuck it, it’s all going to end anyway, so what does it matter?’” he says bitterly. Perhaps that outlook has benefits, he considers. “But I don’t think I ever got there in a good way.” He is a surprisingly careful conversationalist, taking long pauses to risk-assess any admission. I press him for examples of how he would self-sabotage, but he says it wouldn’t do him any good to go into detail. But he admits he almost let this mentality total his career. In 2020, Ezra insisted that he wanted to quit music, telling his manager: “I don’t identify with it, I don’t understand it, I find it really hard to get my head around why I would pursue what I associate with being quite stressful – because the last album was unenjoyable at times, by my own doing.” Ezra had become “the kid who just says yes,” he says – a punishing identity that gave him a perverse kind of validation. “The diary would be bursting – you could almost see it pulsating. And I lost control, and therefore I started to try to control the things that didn’t need controlling.” He gives the example of spending three hours packing hand luggage: “Dude, you could throw some underwear in that bag, a few T-shirts and a toothbrush and you would be fine.” (As we chat, he often gives himself a second-person talking-to.) “ But this thing could be on display at a museum.” He also has Pure O, a form of OCD that involves intrusive thoughts without the physical compulsions. He used to lose weeks to them. During the first lockdown, he found a therapist and practised transcendental meditation, which helped. Now the thoughts might loop for just 30 minutes. He has stopped trying to stop them, “because that’s where I used to wind myself up,” he says. When life opened up again, Ezra got back to writing with his long-term collaborator Joel Pott (formerly of 2000s indie band Athlete), and rediscovered the pleasures of music that his yes-man persona had trampled. “The reason you do this is because you love it,” he tells himself. “And maybe that’s the payoff, that you get to pursue something you love – but as a result, you’re gonna feel it acutely and care too much at times.” (Pott praises the “good people” around Ezra, who told him he didn’t owe anyone anything.) Given Ezra’s renewed joy, it may seem counterintuitive that death looms over Gold Rush Kid. He cavorts with her on Green Green Grass, another insatiable earworm. On the twinkly closer Sun Went Down, he repeats, with real warmth, “I could die now.” It’s not the old nihilism but a sense of peace that comes from knowing he is giving life his best shot, of accepting himself in this moment. While Ezra likes his first two albums, he loves this one. “It doesn’t sound like anything but myself,” he says. The first five tracks are classic Ezra – as bright and buoyant as a new pool inflatable. But then it takes a ruminative shift – the album’s most striking song, I Went Hunting, beautifully addresses his past self-sabotage. It’s not a prelude to him becoming a tortured artist, he says – Ezra disdains artists longing to shed their pop fans and get serious – but the result of “a lot of self-reflection”. He’s chuffed when I single out his favourite line from lead single Anyone for You: “Remember me the way I am, not the way I was.” (Once a month, he prints selected photos from his phone and deletes the rest. “I feel like I’m dragging something along with me,” he says.) He struggles to identify those changes, partly because they’re ineffable, partly because he enjoys privacy. But he gives it a go. He’s discovered that contentment is different from happiness. On this album, he’s telling himself: “You’re all right. You’re not a villain.” Ezra still walked from Land’s End to John o’Groats with two friends for an upcoming documentary series, ultimately relieved he didn’t have to write an album at the same time. Walking 20 to 30 miles a day gave him the same feeling of peace as transcendentalmeditation, one that’s stuck around. There was another experience as well: he won’t discuss the specifics on record because he says he hasn’t figured out how to communicate it, but it showed him that the love in his life was inescapable. “I have these people around me, family and friends, that are there. The lesson was: what you don’t get, George, is that they just love you because of who you are. And don’t try to make sense of that because you won’t be able to. But accept it.” He thinks about it all the time. “It felt seismic, but really calm. I think that’s true of a lot of the last few years – these huge changes that actually just took one tiptoe to the left.” He has learned to look after himself – phone off at 9pm, light the fire, read – and found work-life balance. “I can actually plan meaningful interactions with friends around work,” he says, “which is the thing I’ve always envied in other people.” And no more yes-man. He told management: “Put things in front of me if you think they’re important, and only fight for them if you think they’re really important.” Still, he wants to give Gold Rush Kid a “fighting chance”, especially as he anticipates turning 30 and thinks about “drawing a line in the sand” at some point. “It’s the saddest thing I see in pop music when people just cling on to something,” he says. He isn’t retiring prematurely: he might release music more regularly, but cease touring. “I get a lot from it, positive and negative,” he says. “It’s an insane amount of adrenaline to experience and then to carry that with you.” Ezra is not the sort of pop star who gameplans their career five years in advance – the opposite, in fact. He definitively does not want to break the US. “It’s too big a place to consider mirroring what my work looks like in Europe and Australia,” he says. “To try to recreate that would kill me. I don’t need it.” He also wants children, which feels incompatible with a career at his level. “There are home videos of me as a child saying I want to be a dad,” he says. “I have to question people that are very famous and pursue that after having kids. It’s lost on me. It sounds selfish.” The most he will look to his future career is to suggest that being adored by the nation’s children means his songs will ultimately become “throwback party classics”. Any kids that didn’t already know him soon did if they followed Joe Wicks’s lockdown PE lessons. Ezra’s mum, a primary school teacher, told him Wicks said he couldn’t play music on the videos because of copyright. She suggested that Ezra let Wicks use his songs for free. So he did, then donated the royalties to the NHS. “It was just a good thing to be able to do,” he says. What does it say that pop stars are having to donate to the NHS during a pandemic? He pauses. “There’s a lot I don’t understand,” he says, sadly. “The amount that I don’t understand intimidates me to the point where it probably doesn’t serve me to speak about it because I don’t know where to start. But then I’m like, is that the point? Are you made to feel like you don’t understand when really you do? “And that’s the thing I found hard about the last few years,” he says, with a sudden ragged breath, “is actually feeling… helpless in some way.” He says the last part in the smallest voice, and we’re both surprised to find he is crying, his grey-blue eyes now red. “Sorry!” he says quickly, and regroups. “There’s a lot of confusing stuff going on in the world. It’s sad, you’re right, why are fucking pop stars donating to the NHS?” Ezra says he hasn’t generally made political statements because he doesn’t feel qualified – although he recalls his parents, Labour party members, taking him on marches – and not because his fanbase is so broad. He casts aspersions as he gestures around the Old Barge. “I love this pub. It is empty of an evening and it shouldn’t be,” he says emphatically, referencing the fear over Omicron. “Not that it should be busy, but they’re not helped. If people shouldn’t be going out, tell them to close the doors and help them through that time.” He laments that “making the world an intimidating and confusing place is a really convenient way of pitting people against one another”. It runs counter to his worldview. He comes back to the walk, on which they regularly met “two types of farmer: people that live hand to mouth, up at 4am on Christmas, and they were lovely, pointing us in the right direction. We also met men who wear gold rings on their little fingers and live in big houses on the farms, and they were lovely, and told us which direction to go. It’s why he loved Gogglebox so much, he says, “because it’s good to be reminded you’re all the same in many ways.” Ezra’s music has always expressed his faith in collective goodness: we’re all right together, we’re just human; as he sings on the song Gold Rush Kid. “You’re just like everyone, you’re holding on.” Has that belief been shaken in the past two years, when it’s often seemed as though we aren’t all in this together? “I don’t think so,” he says. “Getting out and walking the country and meeting people – it just isn’t true. I get terrified that everyone’s out to get each other. For the most part, they are – until you step out your front door.” The single Anyone For You is out now; the album Gold Rush Kid follows on 10 June on Columbia Records",Arts/Music,"‘I’ve moved on, and then some’: singer George Ezra on fame, friendship and finding new inspiration",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/30/ive-moved-on-and-then-some-singer-george-ezra-on-fame-friendship-and-finding-new-inspiration
1/30/2022,"Alison, 38, gave birth to her son in June 2021 at a busy London hospital. “We had exemplary care during delivery, and the midwives looking after me during my antenatal care were likewise fantastic,” she recalls.  “However, I didn’t see a midwife face-to-face between my nine-week intake appointment and my 30th week of pregnancy. Then I saw nobody again until I was 34 weeks pregnant, and the next time I was seen was at 38 weeks, even though you’re supposed to be seen weekly at that stage.” At Alison’s two-week postpartum check-up, she had to have her stitches examined in a chair as no other facilities were free. “The ward was so full they’d had to close the birth centre; labour and delivery was full, and I met two women labouring in the early stages of their induction in the hallway. The midwives that came to do home visits were rushed and left me in tears every time,” she says. All NHS staff she came into contact with throughout her maternity care were clearly overworked, Alison says, but doing their best. “There was just no availability on the system, no capacity.” Alison’s experience chimes well with my own. When an A&E doctor explained calmly last June that I was suffering from early pregnancy malaise, I reluctantly decided to go back to the London hospital where I had given birth eight years before. My high-risk twin pregnancy had ended in premature birth at 24 weeks and tragedy – with one baby dying after a three-month battle in intensive care. Throughout my antenatal journey, crucial appointments had been cancelled due to staffing issues, with the result that nobody picked up on early signs of premature labour, until it was too late for intervention. My hopes of receiving better care this time, assuming the trust would be aware of my history, evaporated quickly. By nearly 15 weeks of pregnancy, I had still not been seen by anyone, with text messages supposed to inform me of appointments failing to arrive. When I queried why I had been given a date for a scan two weeks after the latest possible date such a screening could give a diagnosis of chromosomal abnormality, a clinic receptionist told me I should go private if I didn’t like my appointments. A complaint triggered an apology from the trust’s chief executive months later for protracted problems in the booking process, as well as an apology from the deputy head of midwifery for the receptionist’s “inappropriate” advice. By then, I had forked out hundreds of pounds for a private scan and private appointment with an obstetric consultant at the hospital. I was promptly referred for specialist antenatal monitoring on the NHS, and have received excellent care ever since, but plagued by the knowledge that my ability to pay had got the ball rolling. Kerrie, 31, a solicitor from Leicestershire, is one of hundreds of women who responded to a callout I launched via Community, the home of readers’ content on the Guardian and Observer’s website. I wanted to find out how others had experienced NHS maternity care in England over the past year, but I was taken aback by the sheer number of responses from virtually every corner of the country. Like me, Kerrie saw no other way but to shell out hundreds of pounds for private scans during her pregnancy last year, as her trust only offered her appointments outside the windows in which they could be performed. “Every scan was beyond the normal NHS care timescale. I couldn’t have an NHS scan for Down’s syndrome because I was only offered a date after 14 weeks of pregnancy, which is too late,” she says. “My only option was to go private, according to my midwife, who recommended a screening that cost £450.” All Kerrie’s midwife appointments also took place later than they should have. When there were concerns for her baby’s growth in her second trimester, she waited nearly two weeks for a scan that should have happened within 72 hours. Last summer the Care Quality Commission’s chief inspector of hospitals told a parliamentary inquiry that inspections had found that 38% of NHS maternity services “require improvement for safety” – more than in any other medical speciality. A report by the Commons health and social care committee on maternity safety in England subsequently concluded that staffing numbers are the most essential building block in providing safe care, and that progress is urgently needed as far as continuity and personalisation of care is concerned. But in many parts of the country the pandemic appears to have reduced NHS capacities for well-run maternity provision in the long term. Hollie, 30, from Staffordshire, who is expecting her second child, found that lack of continuity was precisely what made her antenatal care problematic. “It has been minimal and lacking, purely for the fact that midwives are understaffed and overworked,” she says. “In 30 weeks of pregnancy, I met my real midwife once, but saw four other midwives who knew nothing about me, so appointments were all a repeat of the last one. I rarely got a chance to voice my concerns.” Her local hospital stopped its childbirth services during the pandemic, so her nearest hospital is now more than 40 minutes away. “I’m being sent all over Staffordshire for appointments. I don’t drive and have a four-year-old – the whole situation is very stressful. Compared with my first pregnancy, I’m finding it incredibly difficult to get the support I need,” Hollie says. For some women, draconian Covid regulations in hospitals and serious staff shortages have led to highly traumatising experiences. Rachael, 31, from Deal, Kent, is still processing the birth of her son, Ollie, in June 2021. “I felt really let down,” she says, “although I am extremely grateful that Ollie was born safely with the help of hard-working professionals.” Her 33-hour excruciating labour was marred by disagreements between doctors and midwives, poor communication and agonisingly long waits in corridors due to capacity issues. “I felt brutalised. I was in so much pain. I don’t want to scare prospective mums, but it really wasn’t OK. I do feel that understaffing affected my care, communication, but also compassion.” Gemma, 34, from Woking, Surrey, gave birth to her second child in September 2020. Although she had significantly less contact with healthcare staff than in her first pregnancy, and was unnerved that many appointments happened over the phone, she found the care leading up to the birth OK. “The birth, however, was the single worst experience of my life,” she says. “Partners were not allowed in until active labour, so I was induced on my own. Staff refused to touch me to comfort me because of Covid, and due to understaffing I was left alone for hours, in the dark, without pain relief. I was crying for help, but nobody came.” Edyta, 37, a healthcare assistant from Rugby, had a similarly “appalling” birth experience. “The maternity ward was so understaffed it felt dangerous. On my first night on the ward, a nurse came and said, ‘I apologise in advance in case you’ll feel abandoned, but it’s just me and one healthcare assistant.’” Like nearly all those who got in touch, Edyta blames staffing levels, not staff. “There are not enough of them, and they are run into the ground. It has put me off wanting another baby for now, but if I was to have more in future, I would consider going abroad to give birth, where going private is cheaper.” Jon Skewes, executive director for external relations at the Royal College of Midwives (RCM), said: “Countless independent reviews of maternity services have cited staff shortages as a potential risk to safety and quality of care. The RCM has been raising concerns about this for over a decade, yet successive governments have chosen not to listen. There are massive pressures on maternity services and the wider NHS because of the pandemic. That has meant sometimes some services had to be adapted or restricted, such as fewer in-person appointments. All these decisions were made with a heavy heart because midwives know how important this is to women.” An NHS spokesperson said: “Despite pressures and the impact Covid has undoubtedly had on staffing, the NHS remains one of the safest places in the world to give birth and services have continued to see women and their babies throughout the pandemic. In addition, the NHS has invested a further £95 million this year to boost workforce numbers, training and leadership.”",News/Society,"If you don’t like it, go private: what my maternity clinic said over scans delay",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/30/if-you-dont-like-it-go-private-what-my-maternity-clinic-said-over-scans-delay
1/30/2022,"The judges met, in private, over a two-day period in May, for what might seem like a minor task: to choose the fifth member of an elections board in rural Spalding county, Georgia. But the meetings were by no means routine. There is no record of their vote or their discussions. The interviews with Democratic and Republican applicants were conducted in private, via Zoom calls. And the position was only vacant because of a new law, specific only to Spalding county, recently introduced by the area’s two Republican state lawmakers.  In the end, the judges chose a Republican, someone who had never served in a government position related to elections, to be the fifth and deciding vote for the Spalding county board of elections and registration. Almost immediately, that Republican, James Newland, cast that deciding vote to cancel Sunday voting – a historically heavy turnout day for Black, largely Democratic voters. It was just the latest blow to the county’s Democrats, and another loss for a party that is losing control of election boards across the state as Republican laws make GOP takeovers possible. But what happened in Spalding county is also just a fragment of GOP efforts nationwide to take over the apparatus of American elections. Their goal? To secure party control at every level of government – from the White House to state legislatures and election offices, all the way down to the precinct level, by employing thousands of poll watchers to potentially call into question Democratic votes. Across the US, Republican legislatures have introduced more than 200 bills aimed at reducing local control over elections and restrict voting access, according to the States United Democracy Center. All of it is aimed at ensuring that Republicans will have control over voting and elections rules, in support of Donald Trump’s false claims of widespread voter fraud in 2020. And the Peach State is ground zero, thanks to its increasingly central roles – as a swing state, and as the center of bogus disputes over the 2020 election results. The turn of events in Spalding county might have come as a shock to locals – a majority Democratic election board, with three Black women, becoming majority Republican, with two white men and another of Cherokee descent, virtually overnight – but Spalding county is no outlier. In at least five other Georgia counties, local election authorities have been restructured in favor of Republicans. It’s all part of the same story: the nationwide push to place GOP officials in positions of authority over elections. “The news isn’t really covering it because it’s so local,” said Zachery Fuller, a political organizer and former Democratic candidate for office in Griffin, the county seat. “But when it happens to so many counties it’s the same thing, even though it’s different laws: it’s voter suppression.” At the heart of what happened in Spalding county is that new law, which itself is an example of the tactics Republicans are pursuing across the country to ensure they control elections. Passed in March, HB 769 changed the rules for determining the tie-breaking vote for Spalding ounty’s election board. The five-person board always has two Democrats and two Republicans; previously, Democrats and Republicans would often flip a coin to determine the fifth member. But Republican state representatives David Knight and Karen Mathiak introduced a law requiring that the fifth member be chosen by a majority vote of the county’s superior court judges. Those judges – Chief Judge Fletcher Sams, Scott Ballard and Benjamin Coker – advertised the position in the local press for 30 days. All three judges are white; Sams said he identifies as an independent, while the other judges did not comment on their political affiliations. In the end, the judges chose the inexperienced Newland over at least two Black Democrats, including Vera McIntosh – who had been removed from her position on the board because HB 769 also required board members to live in Spalding county, which she did not – as well as Elbert Solomon, a longtime Democratic operative here. “All they wanted to see was the fact that I was Black – because they couldn’t tell by looking at my résumé,” Solomon said. “I went to white colleges, I was an executive at Procter & Gamble, even my last name wouldn’t tell you that I was Black. That’s all they wanted to know.” “I can’t help what people think but that’s ridiculous,” Sams said, denying that race played any role in the judges’ decision. “I was very impressed with at least one or two Democratic candidates, and they were seriously considered.” Regardless, the new law didn’t come out of nowhere. Ever since election day of 2020, Republicans in Spalding county have used alleged problems with voting to justify their efforts to replace Democratic election officials. On election day 2020, some voters had initially been prevented from casting their ballots on machines equipped with software from Dominion Voting Systems. Marcia Ridley, the county’s former Democratic elections supervisor, said it was a temporary software problem caused by Dominion, but soon the Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, was calling for Ridley to step down, citing “serious management issues and poor decision-making”. Knight and Mathiak joined Raffensperger in calling for Ridley’s removal, and less than two weeks later asked the state’s attorney general to investigate her for failing to properly post information about board meetings. It didn’t end there. After the election, local Republicans were up in arms over claims of mishandled ballots. Mathiak and a former Republican elections board member, Betty Bryant – who believes the 2020 election was “robbed” from Trump – both claimed they had heard from a person who had received 12 mail-in ballots. As a crowd gathered outside the board of elections, a Republican on the county commission recorded a video of the protesters, and posted it to Facebook. Later, he posted a picture of a ballot envelope that contained no ballot, apparently in an attempt to suggest electoral fraud. As the mood darkened, concerned for their safety, Glenda Henley, a former Democratic board member, asked police to escort election workers to their cars. Next, the crowds started showing up at previously sleepy elections board meetings. “We had so many people coming, and the audience would disrupt the meeting by shouting or saying ugly things,” Henley said. One particularly loud voice was Roy McClain, a shooting range coach with a lengthy military career who had replaced a previous Republican board member. McClain had ties to Mathiak: he had fundraised for her and appeared alongside her at numerous events. McClain “was always loud, always negative”, according to Henley. “When he came in, it was just turmoil, anything to disrupt the business of elections.” (McClain did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Knight or Mathiak.) Then, in April, just days before the end of the 2021 legislative session, Mathiak and Knight escalated the situation: they introduced HB 769. The bill caught some county officials off-guard, according to emails obtained by American Oversight. Former elections board members told the Guardian they had no prior warning that the bill was coming. But Solomon said the bill’s purpose was obvious. He and others had worked in 2020 to register new county voters, most of them African American – a get-out-the-vote effort that produced results and nearly led to the election of the Democratic candidate Daa’ood Amin as mayor of Griffin. “What happened is we increased registered voters here by 900 people in less than a year,” Solomon said. “We had a mayor’s race here and a Black person almost won – and only lost by 15 votes.” Demographics in Spalding county are changing, according to Solomon and Fuller: what was solidly Republican territory is now becoming more Democratic-leaning. “They see the writing on the wall,” Solomon said. If the new law was intended to increase Republican power, it worked: Newman was swiftly installed on the elections board. In an interview, Newman said he was chosen by the judges because they believed he would be an impartial tie-breaking vote – despite the fact that he is a self-proclaimed Republican – and rejected the notion that race played a role, noting that he is of Cherokee descent. Newland claimed the judges told him that they chose him “because I was the closest they could find, out of the people who applied to the job, to a neutral party.” As for why he voted to cancel Sunday voting, Newland claimed the county couldn’t afford a seventh day of voting. Even less neutral is the man appointed by the local GOP to one of the other two Republican board positions: Ben Johnson, a former election board member who resigned as head of the county Republican party to take the job. Johnson, a fervent proponent of the false belief that the 2020 election was beset with widespread voter fraud, also runs an IT firm, Liberty Technology, that does maintenance for the county’s computer equipment. Fuller calls it a clear conflict of interest for Johnson. “If his company has direct control over the servers for Spalding county and the city of Griffin, he can see all of the data from anyone who uses these public servers,” Fuller said. “[That] could be data collection used against voters to help organize – and that is data that other members of the board wouldn’t have access to.” Asked whether there was a conflict of interest, Mike Windham, the county’s IT manager, said, “Off the top of my head, no, but the optics are a little funny.” Johnson ignored repeated requests for comment, and at an election board meeting in early January responded to the Guardian’s questions by saying, “I don’t talk to fake news.” But Johnson’s beliefs are well documented on his Facebook page. A little more than a year after Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden, Johnson posted about the “hours upon hours of video-taped ballot harvesting in Georgia, the phantoms all over, the dirty voter rolls, the withholding of subpoenaed materials, the list goes on”. In person, Johnson is generally known as an intelligent and capable member of the board of elections, according to current and former colleagues from both parties. But his social media posts show a different side than the calm and polite face he presents to election board meetings. Specifically, Johnson has taken issue with Dominion Voting Systems, which handles election software throughout Georgia and is the frequent target of conspiracy theories about voter fraud. Only last month, Johnson attacked Dominion at a board meeting, making a false claim that a judge in a Georgia lawsuit, brought by a Republican, had ruled that its software in Georgia was “illegal”. “[R]ight now, the judicial opinion is that the equipment we’re using is illegal, which blows my mind,” Johnson said. That’s not true. The judge has not ruled on the matter; a trial is pending. Then, last month, if all this turmoil weren’t enough, board members were hit with nearly 2,000 emails demanding yet another audit into the 2020 presidential election – despite three previous reviews, conducted by the Republican Raffensperger, which all confirmed the win for Biden. While it remains unknown who prompted more than 1,900 people, all from outside Spalding county, to join the email deluge, some clues can be gleaned from the demands themselves. The emails were form letters and include references to a notorious conspiracy theorist, Jovan Hutton Pulitzer, who was involved with the controversial and unnecessary audit by the Cyber Ninjas firm in Maricopa ounty, Arizona (which again confirmed Biden won there). According to Jim O’Brien, one of the two Democratic board members in Spalding county, the campaign has all the markings of an organized effort. It was a “cyber-attack intended to intimidate and harass”, O’Brien said. “I’d like to know if any local Republican officials knew about this.” Slowly, the sense is dawning in these communities that individual cases like Spalding county’s are not one-offs but are part of a pattern emerging nationwide. Henley, too, is concerned about the way things are going, and who is behind it. After more than six years on the board, she wants to know why the new law that allowed a Republican takeover in Spalding county was passed when it did, and who might be pulling the strings even higher up than the state Republicans who made it happen. “It was a sneak attack,” she said. “I think we were targeted, but I don’t have the evidence of what they were doing. I think it was even higher up. I think it’s more convoluted and embedded.”",News/US news,Georgia county purges Democrats from election board and cancels Sunday voting,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/30/georgia-county-purges-democrats-from-election-board-and-cancels-sunday-voting

1/30/2022,"Every night my boyfriend and I have been sitting on the sofa and hungrily watching strangers break up. Couples Therapy is a docu-series filmed in the New York office of elegant psychoanalyst Dr Orna Guralnik as she deftly sieves the lumps out of four relationships. Once you have got over the bogglement at the idea that these couples have agreed to be so vulnerable in front of this many cameras, knowing every eye-roll and revelation will be seen by millions (including their dads, bosses and exes), you can relax into the radical entertainment. And some time after that, perhaps in bed, or when flossing your teeth, questions might appear. Questions like, “Do I interrupt like she does?” and, “Could that guy not perhaps take his awful denim cap off inside?” and, “How can any of us hope to understand each other when we can’t even understand ourselves?” The structure of a couple is one I am familiar with and fascinated by. Why (I ask myself fondly, 18 years into a relationship that could not be more traditional if it wore a blazer and drank real ale) do we choose this partnership, generation after generation, morning after morning? Two strangers leaning against each other like two cards trying to make a shelter. I think often of the tree that grew around a bike, evolving into something monsterish and beautiful that would never ride again. When the bike was left chained there in 1914, the tree treated it like a wound, scarring and scabbing itself around the frame – now the bike is more than 7ft from the ground, and the tree a living metaphor for every long-term relationship on this bended, burning earth. I like it, I suppose. Is that enough?  As some people are beginning to question the benefits of monogamous coupledom (and happier to discuss their mental health) it’s becoming more common for young people to visit couples counsellors, previously assumed a sort of hospice for those in the death throes of a cooling marriage. One 2017 survey put the number of millennials who had attended couples counselling at 51%, and in 2018 counselling charity Relate reported a 30% increase in UK clients under 40 in four years. Part of this shift is due, surely, to the way shows such as Couples Therapy (and Esther Perel’s podcast Where Should We Begin? which similarly invites an audience into real-life therapy sessions) have pulled back a curtain on the previously shadowed practice of therapy, one still stained by ideas of shame and failure. And how we lap them up! How we love to watch! What joy is greater, in the first winter of 2022, than wild swimming in the frosty depths of another couple’s disappointments? Is there anything better than watching a marriage transform into a white ball of blood and fur from the comfort of your living room? There is the therapist, there is the couple, there is the relationship, and there is me, drinking Lady Grey with a raw sort of glee. Was the husband or was he not (and here I’ll quote directly from episode one, featuring linen-shirted antihero Mau) entitled to “zero responsibility” for the birthday orgy his wife of 23 years had planned for him, and as much “spectacular, enthusiastic and genuine” sex as he wanted, without putting in “any work on his part”? When Dr Guralnik earnestly said it was “hard to meet him” I shrieked into my biscuit. But the questions each show left me with kept reverberating. How can a person manage the psychological bruises left by historical trauma in order to maintain a trusting relationship? How important are feelings when they knock against facts? The biggest thing I’ve taken away from being a voyeur to other people’s therapy sessions, though, is the knowledge that listening is difficult, and successfully communicating feelings we can’t even articulate to ourselves almost impossible. Not everyone can or should have therapy, but what I’m left with after a rich but exhausting binge-watch of Guralnik being wise and fabulous, is the realisation that we should all be taught how to listen. How could life be, if talking was not the only communicative skill applauded and prized? Rather than simply being a mirror, hearing as a passive state, I would relish the chance to learn how to listen in a way that allowed me to hear the subconscious whirrings, understand my own lingering soundtrack, hear what somebody is really trying to say. You glimpse, in soft moments, a world where we could understand ourselves enough to show real empathy for others, or one where we can really try to know the people we say we love. It’s funny – though the cameras initially seem horribly invasive, after a while their focus reminds the viewer how important it is to pay attention to the person who isn’t speaking. How what’s being said is affecting them, and how they might misunderstand it; what memories, politics, judgments are also playing in their ears. Beneath that horrifying denim cap.

1/30/2022,"MPs will be asked this week to end the “shocking” practice of making cystic fibrosis patients in England pay prescription charges for the drugs that they need to stay alive. The condition is the nation’s most common inherited, life-threatening disease and affects more than 7,000 people. Prescription charges, first introduced in 1952, were abolished in 1965; then, when they were reintroduced in 1968, exemptions were made for those suffering from long-lasting ailments such as cancers, diabetes and epilepsy. But children with cystic fibrosis were not expected to live to adulthood and so the condition was not exempted.  As a result of new medicines and the creation of special physiotherapy regimes, cystic fibrosis patients now live well into their 40s. “Medicine and society have moved on, so should the exemption list to reflect modern-day experience,” said Paul Maynard, the Conservative MP for Blackpool North and Cleveleys, who will call for an end to prescription charges for the disease at a special Commons debate on the illness this week. “As someone who has a long-term medical condition – epilepsy – it has always amazed me that adults with cystic fibrosis have to pay for their prescriptions whilst I do not.” Cystic fibrosis is triggered when a person inherits a mutated gene from each parent. This affects the behaviour of chloride ions inside the body, which become disrupted and impair the ability to produce healthy digestive juices, sweat and mucus. Bodily fluids become thick, sticky and clog up lungs, digestive tracts and other organs. Sometimes enzymes from the pancreas cannot reach the stomach, so patients cannot digest food. “Patients have to take a significant number of drugs every day just to stay alive and also need hours of physiotherapy and exercise,” said Becky Kilgariff, head of information and support at the Cystic Fibrosis Trust. Often patients find it very difficult to maintain jobs and some live with extremely strained finances, she said. Recent cases highlighted by the trust include that of Danielle, who has struggled with the sudden recent increase in her energy bills and was having to decide between putting on her heating or buying food. In another case, a patient called Tom required intravenous antibiotics that could only be given in hospital. This disrupted his work and affected his income, threatening his ability to pay for food and heating for his young family. In both cases, the trust was able to help through its winter hardship support fund but its staff argue it is deeply unfair that – on top of the problems affecting patients – they still have to pay prescription charges for the drugs they need to stay alive. In some cases, patients are able to buy an annual pre-payment certificate costing £108, but financial vulnerability still means that for many the cost poses a significant burden on their day-to-day living. “It is shocking that people who have a lifelong and life-limiting condition still have to pay for the drugs they need every day due to rules that were drawn up when people with cystic fibrosis weren’t expected to live beyond childhood,” added David Ramsden, the trust’s chief executive. “We are seeing how people in our community are facing tough economic choices as the cost of living increases, and it is the time to make this change.” Crucially, people in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland do not have to pay prescription charges and campaigners say it is time the government stopped penalising people in England, especially those with cystic fibrosis and other long-term ailments that are not on an outdated exemption list.",News/Society,"‘Shocking’: cystic fibrosis patients should not have to pay for drugs that keep them alive, says MP",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/30/shocking-cystic-fibrosis-patients-should-not-have-to-pay-for-drugs-that-keep-them-alive-says-mp
1/30/2022,"On a chilly open field in Texas, Dan Patrick was delivering prepared remarks about the spectre of socialism when the crowd broke into a chant about the 2020 presidential election. “Well, we all know who won in 2020, don’t we?” the state’s lieutenant governor ad-libbed. “Who won?” There was apparently not a soul who believes the answer is Joe Biden.  The campaign rally in Conroe, near Houston, was the latest stop in what might be called Donald Trump’s “big lie” tour. The former US president is travelling the country, backing Republican candidates for midterm elections who pass a specific litmus test: reinforcing his debunked claims of voter fraud. They did so with gusto at a rally in Arizona earlier this month. On Saturday night, thousands of Texans watched giant video screens play a trailer for a “documentary” that purports to reveal how 2,000 “mules” were used to stuff votes into drop boxes in 2020 (state officials and judges found no significant evidence of irregularities). The trailer’s sinister visual and sound effects were the overture for a speech by the Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, who led a lawsuit seeking to overturn the 2020 election results in four battleground states only to see it dismissed by the supreme court. Then came Patrick, who after Trump’s defeat offered up to $1m for evidence of voter fraud, and the governor, Greg Abbott, who has ordered an audit of the 2020 election results in four big counties (even though Trump won the Lone Star State by 300,000 votes). Abbott did not promulgate the “big lie” directly but urged the crowd to show their support for “our president” Trump. It was a jarringly white leadership team in a state of rapidly growing racial diversity. Chris Hollins, a lawyer and vice-president of the Texas Democratic party, said in a phone interview: “This is a star-studded lineup of vote suppressors and anti-democracy champions.” Oil-rich Texas has the biggest population of any state apart from California and biggest land mass of any state barring Alaska. “Everything is bigger in Texas,” the saying goes, and it appears that Trump’s brand of populist authoritarianism is no exception. The state’s Republican party has slashed gun controls, enforced the most rigid abortion limits in the country and taken a draconian line on border security and how race is taught in schools. Paxton – under criminal investigation by the FBI over claims that he abused his office to benefit a wealthy donor – boasted that he has already filed 27 lawsuits against the Biden administration over environmental regulations, asylum rules and other issues. “Texas will be leading the fight against the Biden administration,” he told the rally. Paxton is facing the most competitive Republican primary on 1 March but not because his challengers oppose Trump. One is Louie Gohmert, a congressman who has downplayed the 6 January insurrection and attended Saturday’s rally as a spectator. Another is George P Bush, nephew of former president George W Bush, whose campaign signs lined the approach to the rally venue and whose staff handed out flyers that proclaimed Bush “an early endorser of President Trump”. But it is Trump’s endorsement that is the golden ticket here. Among his slate of anti-democratic candidates is Sid Miller, the state’s agriculture commissioner, who declared that he no longer regards the midterms as a contest between Democrats and Republicans or liberals and conservatives. “It’s a race between patriots and traitors,” he said chillingly. “It’s that simple.” For his part, Abbott has pivoted to the right to fend off even more extreme rivals and keep in the former president’s good graces. It is working. Rally goer Jessica Hehl, 33, commented: “I think Governor Abbott is a little weak but if Trump endorses him then I trust Trump.” Hehl, a stay-at-home mother wearing a T-shirt that said “Let’s go Brandon” – rightwing code for insulting Biden – dismissed Democrats’ warnings that democracy is under threat. “If anything, it’s the other way around. Biden and the liberals stole our election and are trying to keep our faces covered and to mandate vaccines for four-year-olds.” Her husband Brian Hehl, 40, a veteran of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars who now works in underground construction, declared: “We’re pro-life, pro-gun, pro-Trump, pro-freedom.” He cited baseless conspiracy theories about dead people voting and ballot papers being run through machines multiple times to insist that the 2020 election was stolen. “The evidence is everywhere. There are things we see and things we don’t see.” Vendors sold merchandise including flags that proclaimed “Trump won”, “Trump 2024”, “Fuck Biden” and, of course, “Make America great again”. Jason Weaver, 37, a construction business owner, was wearing a T-shirt that said, “Jesus is my saviour, Trump is my president”. For him, Trump’s assertion of voter fraud is enough. “I believe what he says, not what Biden says,” he explained. Several speakers at the rally flattered Trump by dangling the prospect of him winning back the White House in 2024. The event culminated with a characteristically dark, divisive and disjointed speech from the 45th president himself. He vowed: “Texas is never, ever turning blue. That is, unless they rig the election like they’ve been doing in numerous states.” Trump pledged that if he decides to run for president again and wins, the 6 January insurrectionists will be treated “fairly” and could receive pardons, prompting cheers from the crowd. He falsely asserted: “The 2020 election was rigged and everyone knows it. You know who knows it more than anyone else? The Democrats.” This myth has firmly taken root and manifested itself in Texas, where the Republicans-led state legislature has used it to justify an overhaul of laws in the name of “election integrity”. Matt Rinaldi, chairman of the state party, said: “We passed an election law to ensure that 2020 will never happen again here.” But this was not before a standoff when Democrats fled the state to deny Republicans the quorum needed to conduct legislative business. The limbo ended after 38 days when some Democrats returned, enabling Republicans to press ahead with making 24-hour polling sites, drive-through voting and the proactive sending of vote-by-mail applications illegal and punishable by imprisonment. It was a bitter blow for Hollins. The lawyer had successfully introduced these measures during the pandemic-hit 2020 election as county clerk of Harris county, which contains Houston. “We’re under assault in Texas and we’re under assault in many states across this country,” he said. “Democracy is frankly in peril in the United States right now and that’s why I’ve spent my time and so many others have spent their time trying to make the case at the federal level to pass laws that will protect our constitutional right to vote regardless of your party, regardless of what state you live in and regardless of many other attributes.” The effects are already being felt. Ahead of the primaries, local election officials have rejected thousands of mail-in ballot applications because of new personal ID requirements. They have even blamed a limited supply of voter registration applications on paper shortages. Hollins added: “Everything that Republican officials, particularly in Texas, are pushing right now seeks to make voting harder and harder, especially if you’re a person of colour, a young person, a person with a disability and especially if you live on the margins of society where things like having an ID or having transportation to the polls is a challenge for you.” Republicans deny the charges and accuse Democrats of scaremongering. Mark McCaig, chairman of the Texas Republican Initiative, a grassroots political organisation, said: “I don’t think there’s any voter suppression going on. It’s extremely easy to vote in Texas, especially compared to other states. We have nearly two weeks of early voting. All we’re doing is trying to make sure that our voting is secure but that legal votes can be cast easily.” Asked about Trump’s false claim that the 2020 election was stolen from him, McCaig did not offer a direct response, insisting that he is focused on Texas. The attack on American democracy has seen Trump acolytes launch campaigns for key offices in an effort to take control of election machinery. Should the former president run again in 2024 and lose, it is feared, these radicals could abuse their positions to overturn the results and hand him victory. The Brennan Center for Justice, a nonprofit law and public policy institute, said in a recent report that “this is the first time in the modern era that questions about the legitimacy of elections have played such a prominent role in contests for election officials”. Texas has its share of candidates using the “big lie” as a pretext to argue their success in the midterms is essential to the survival of democracy. Angelica Luna Kaufman, spokesperson for the state’s Democratic party, said: “Because this Trumpism and this extremism has taken such a hold in Texas, we’re seeing that, even in moderately conservative counties and districts, people who are basically insurgents are being encouraged to run for public office on the Republican ticket in the primaries. “That’s very scary. That’s going to push out those moderate conservatives and you’re going to have this extremism representing large portions of our state that do not share that same ideology.” Then there is gerrymandering. Abbott signed into law newly redrawn congressional district maps that, voting rights advocates contend in a lawsuit, dilute the vote of communities of colour since recent population growth has been overwhelmingly among Latino, Black and Asian American people. Activists warn that Republicans are playing a long game to shore up white minority rule, with Texas serving as a template for the nation. Trump won the state in 2020 by 5.5 percentage points, the closest margin of victory by a Republican presidential nominee in decades. Cristina Tzintzún Ramirez, the president and executive director of NextGen America, the biggest youth-vote mobilisation organisation in the country, said: “It’s the largest battleground state in the country so Republicans are staking long-term bets on how they can suppress the vote of communities of colour to hold power long term. It’s not just about 2024 – it’s about 2024 and beyond. “Texas is really a microcosm of where we’re headed as a country. We are a state where 95% of our growth came from communities of colour over the last census. It is that exact population that they are trying to suppress.” She added: “As a country we are becoming more diverse and we see a Republican party that is hellbent on suppressing and diluting the power of that voice and vote. In Texas, from voter registration to how we vote to redistricting, they are using any measure and means possible to make sure that our voices are not heard equally to our white counterparts.” Speaking by phone from the state capital Austin, Ramirez was withering in her assessment of the guest speakers at Trump’s rally. “It’s a lineup that quite frankly looks nothing like the state of Texas. People have an image of our state and there are some great white cowboys but Texas is majority young, Brown and Black. “Republicans want to make sure that our voice is not heard in the democratic process because they fear the power of our vote. They’re not winning on their ideas. They’re winning by breaking the rules and bending them in their favour.”",News/US news,Trump tours the country endorsing candidates to reinforce the ‘big lie’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/30/trump-tours-the-country-endorsing-candidates-to-reinforce-the-big-lie
1/30/2022,"For 40 years this Brighton apartment, set on an elm-shaded, stucco-fronted square in the city’s upper reaches, was the home of opera director John Cox, who used it as a bolthole while he was working at Glyndebourne. A creative crowd, including David Hockney, (his boldly graphic designs for The Rake’s Progress are a Glyndebourne perennial) mingled in the garden, screened by a heady curtain of white wisteria. When the season ended, Hockney’s parting gift to Cox was the art deco fireplace, which brings a dramatic flourish to the sitting room. ​ Today, the ground-floor apartment has a suitably theatrical new owner. Gary McCann, a rising star of opera design (he has productions opening in Venice, Bologna and Bilbao) bought the apartment from Cox in 2016. It has remained “pretty much unchanged” since then, says the historically minded set and costume designer, who describes the architecture as a “Frankenstein’s monster” of eras. “It was converted in the 1920s. There are elements of early Victoriana mixed with the 1980s.”  There is also no central heating and sea gales make the sash windows rattle. “But I like all those layers of the past; that sense of continuity,” says McCann cutting a vintage dash in his trademark, three-piece tweed suit and pocket watch, moustache waxed and twirled. “When I go to the barber’s I ask for a Nicholas II. I describe my style as a cross between an Edwardian gentleman and a World War II dispatch rider,” he continues, gesturing to the swirling 1940s motorcyclist’s coat hanging next to his collection of bowler hats, displayed like props in a period drama. In another neat twist, it was Cox who gave McCann his first operatic break. “I’d had a steady but tortoise-like career working in theatre. But in the mid-2000s, I needed work so I wrote to Cox who I’d met when we lived near each other in Greenwich. He offered me a job on Fidelio at Garsington. We became friends after that. When he decided to sell this place he asked if I’d be interested in buying it.” There is a stage set feel to the eccentric layout. From the tiny, angled hallway, the rooms fan out ahead, offering tantalising glimpses. It was Cox who installed the saloon doors, which open with a swagger on to the narrow bathroom with its faded, chequerboard Lino floor. The kitchen opposite has the original electric cooker and rustic surfaces. The large bedroom overlooks the pear tree in the garden; at the front, the sitting room, illuminated by three bay windows, still has the plush brown 1980s carpet: “It’s the one thing I don’t like.” Over time, McCann has tweaked the colour schemes – from dark greys to soft maritime blues and greens. There is not a stick of new furniture or art here. “Everything came from junk shops,” he says, pointing out the 1930s pottery and midcentury sideboard and the peach-tinted art deco mirror that complements Hockney’s fire surround. Cox bequeathed the early Anglepoise lamp and the elaborate fire screen, with its orange tree motif: “It’s Arts and Crafts, but the mix works well,” says McCann. Combining antique and modern “with a dramatic twist” is what McCann excels at. “I’ve always liked mixing references to classical architecture with contemporary elements – it adds an edge without alienating audiences.” One broadsheet critic described a recent production of the comic opera Der Rosenkavalier as a “swirling, gargantuan” feast of baroque plasterwork, as the “best production in 50 years”. His 1980s childhood, growing up on a council estate near Belfast during the height of the Troubles against a backdrop of “crude but scenic” protest murals and bomb explosions, has also seeped in to his productions. “Quite often there will be images of destruction in my sets; things have been damaged or compromised. I like to convey the sense that beauty is fragile.” Like characters from one of his productions, a cast of military types gazes down from the sitting room walls. McCann found the gilt-framed portraits at markets in Berlin and Vienna, where he has designed productions for the State Opera: “All these people had extraordinary lives. So you could say I’ve created my own ancestors – even if I do feel they’re judging me sometimes.” One RAF officer is by AR Thompson, a war artist who painted the murals on the Queen Mary. There are two versions of the same aristocrat: confident and youthful in 1904; corpulent and time-worn after the First World War. “Telling stories is my job, so I was intrigued by the narrative behind the paintings.” In the bedroom is a dark landscape is of Ashington, Northumberland. The mining village, with its slagheap and terraces, was the birthplace of the 1930s Ashington Group of self-taught painters, most of whom were miners. In 2007, McCann designed the “pared-back Brechtian” setting for Lee Hall’s stage version of their story. The Pitmen Painters transferred from sell-out runs at the National to Broadway. Nearby, the low, chrome-framed bed is another Coxian legacy. McCann thinks that the headboard – made from an old panelled door – may have come from a Glyndebourne set. One day McCann will redo the apartment and make it “more coherent”. But he will tread lightly. “It will take me a long time to plan because there’s so much character here. You can’t just rip it out and put in a bog-standard kitchen. I need to conserve its atmosphere of something that will last forever.” One element will never change. The Hockney fireplace is, as he says, “embedded in the DNA of this place”.",Lifestyle/Life and style,An opera designer’s Brighton home hits the high notes,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/30/an-opera-designers-brighton-home-hits-the-high-notes
1/30/2022,"If the great campaigners for free speech of the past, such as Baruch Spinoza or Mary Wollstonecraft or Frederick Douglass, were alive today, “they would surely declare the 21st century an unprecedented golden age”. So suggests Jacob Mchangama in his new history of free speech. It’s a claim that might raise a few eyebrows. This, after all, is an age in which, from China to Saudi Arabia, dictatorial rulers imprison and kill political opponents with impunity. An age in which governments in formally democratic nations such as India use the judicial system to try to silence critics. An age in which more than 1,400 journalists have been murdered in 30 years. An age in which governments across the globe desperately seek ways of curbing speech on social media they consider dangerous. And in which, in the west, there is a constant debate about “cancel culture” and the erosion of academic freedom.  Mchangama, a leading campaigner for free speech, is not trying to dismiss the reality of contemporary censorship. He is suggesting, rather, that in historical terms, we have never been more free to speak our minds. But this leads to a paradox. The very fact that, certainly in the west, we live in far more open societies has led many to be sanguine and dismissive of the threat that restrictions on speech can impose upon us. The very success of historical struggles can obscure the lessons of those struggles. Historically, the demand for free speech was at the heart of the fight for social justice. From the challenge posed by freethinkers in 10th-century Islam to the abolitionist struggle in 19th-century America, from the suffragette movement to campaigns for liberation from colonial rule, there has long been a recognition that democracy, social justice and free speech go hand in hand and that censorship was a weapon wielded by the powerful to stymie social change. Today, though, the issues seem more confusing. Much censorship, particularly in liberal democracies, is imposed in the name of protecting not the powerful but the powerless or the vulnerable: laws against hate speech, for instance, or restricting the scope of racists or bigots. And where once the left was clearly opposed to censorship, many now support restrictions in the name of the progressive good. As the left has vacated the ground of free speech, the right and the far right have become encamped upon it. This has further distorted the debate, the cause of free speech coming to be seen as the property of the right, making many on the left even more wary of the idea. One of the ironies, though, is that many arguments used today to defend speech restrictions as protections for the powerless are often the same as those once used by the powerful to protect their interests from challenge. When the US abolitionist newspaper editor Elijah Lovejoy was murdered in 1837 by a pro-slavery mob in Illinois, a southern newspaper blamed him for his own death, as he had “utterly disregarded the sentiments of a large majority of the people of that place”. A century and a half later, we heard the same arguments in calls for the banning of The Satanic Verses or in claims that the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists were responsible for their own deaths, because they, too, had “disregarded the sentiments” of many Muslims. Or take hate speech. In the 1950s, there was a major debate about the wording of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, one of the seminal documents of human rights, adopted by the UN in 1966. The draft proposal sought to prohibit “any advocacy of national, racial or religious hostility that constitutes an incitement to violence”. The Soviet Union wanted to delete the reference to violence and make any form of hatred illegal. Such a move, warned Eleanor Roosevelt, chair of the drafting committee, “would be extremely dangerous” as “any criticism of public or religious authorities might all too easily be described as incitement to hatred and consequently prohibited”. Half a century on, Roosevelt’s warning seems highly prescient. Instances in which the expansion of speech has facilitated the spread of obnoxious or dangerous ideas are well-documented: from the newly invented printing press giving fuel to witch-hunts in early modern Europe; to newspapers playing a major role in whipping up the racist frenzy that led to lynchings in 19th-century America; to the media’s role in the 20th century in fomenting hatred against Jews in Germany and Tutsis in Rwanda. Yet we can also see from the historical record that while it is necessary to legally curtail incitement to violence, trying to combat hatred more broadly through censorship can be both ineffective and dangerous. One of the deepest-held beliefs about the dangers of free speech is the Weimar myth: the belief that unrestrained freedom of speech allowed the Nazis to spread their poisonous ideas in 1920s Germany and that restrictions on speech and the suppression of antisemitic propaganda would have stalled the rise of Hitler. In fact, the Weimar republic, while constitutionally supportive of free speech, possessed what we would now call hate speech laws and powers to shut down newspapers. Hundreds of Nazis were prosecuted under these laws. Between 1923 and 1933, the viciously antisemitic newspaper Der Stürmer was either confiscated or tried in court on 36 occasions and its editor, Julius Streicher, twice jailed. Many scholars argue that despite such laws Weimar courts were unduly lenient towards hate-mongers and that judges sympathised with Nazi aims. Other studies suggest that such leniency was the exception, not the rule. Wherever the truth lies in this debate, the primary failure in preventing the rise of Nazism was not legal but political. And this is true of hatred and bigotry today. We often forget, too, that the victims of censorship are more often than not minorities and those fighting for social change. From Indian climate change activists being charged with “promoting enmity between communities” to British police charging feminists with “hate crimes”, censorship in the name of “preventing hatred” is widely used to target social activists. We are the inheritors of centuries of struggle against restrictions on what we are able to say. If we forget the lessons of those struggles, we are in danger also of letting the gains of those struggles slip away.

1/30/2022,"Four months after getting sick with Covid, Anne-Héloise Dautel couldn’t eat anything at all. “I just wanted to vomit, I was gagging at everything around me,” she said. “I couldn’t even stand my own smell. I was showering five times a day.” Coffee, toothpaste, shampoo and roast meat were the worst. By the time she went to hospital, she weighed just 46kg. Severe weight loss and kidney failure are some of the impacts of smell and taste distortions which leave people unable to eat or drink things they loved, like coffee or bacon, because they smell like rotting flesh or sewage.  The loss of taste or smell was identified as a Covid symptom very early in the pandemic, and there is growing evidence that a substantial number of people go on to develop long-term distortions to their senses. AbScent, a UK-based support group for people with taste and smell disorders, occupied a tiny niche before the pandemic, with 1,500 members. Now it has 76,000 worldwide. Scientists at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden last week published a study that found nearly half of the infected people it studied in the first wave had experienced distorted smell, a condition known as parosmia. A third were less able to detect smells, according to the pre-print, which has not yet been peer reviewed. The Office for National Statistics estimates that more than 500,000 people in the UK have been suffering Covid symptoms for more than a year. “There’s been an explosion of these kinds of syndromes and symptoms,” said Simon Gane, a consultant rhinologist at the Royal National Ear, Nose and Throat and Eastman Dental Hospitals in London. “It’s much more widespread than before.” Many sufferers of parosmia and dysgeusia – the distorted sense of taste – began to experience the condition weeks or months after recovering from Covid, he said. Some had developed a total loss of smell – anosmia – and had started to recover it. “I felt I was losing my brain. They taught me to try to remember how to smell,” said Dautel, a 32-year-old architect who lives in London and spent 10 weeks at a hospital in Rennes, Brittany, being treated alongside stroke patients. Ellie Phillips, a TV and radio presenter, had Covid in January 2021 then started to notice problems four months later. The 34-year-old abandoned her lockdown habit of going for coffee, then the odour of oil in a frying pan also became unbearable. Her friends thought she must be pregnant – many women develop aversions to types of food during pregnancy – and then at a wedding reception she was confronted by a bruschetta laden with melted cheese. “It was like sewage and rotting flesh,” she said. “I’ve smelt open cancer wounds – that’s the closest thing I can say. I was literally sick in the toilet for 20 minutes. I was too embarrassed to tell my friends. When I got home things got progressively worse.” Phillips lost a substantial amount of weight while doctors tried to diagnose her illness. Now she is surviving on high-calorie protein shakes intended for cancer patients having chemotherapy. Other cases are equally distressing for sufferers. Christine Dowling’s 16-year-old granddaughter cannot even drink water. Jane Cooper, an artist and marketing director, finds shampoo smells like rotting fish and rice like white spirit. For weeks she thought an animal had died in her flat. An NHS worker developed parosmia two months after losing her smell through Covid. “One of the hardest parts is being intimate with my partner as he doesn’t smell how I remember,” she said. “I couldn’t even bring myself to say this to him as I know how upsetting this would be.” Many have turned for support to Chrissi Kelly, who founded AbScent after trying to recover her sense of smell after a viral infection in 2012. She has funded and conducted research into the condition with Dr Jane Parker at Reading University. Their most recent paper pinpointed 15 molecular triggers in coffee that trigger parosmia. “Our olfactory sense is there to alert us to potential danger, and people with parosmia search for words like sewage, burning, electrics to describe it,” said Kelly. “When you question them more closely, they use those words to signify the greatest amount of disgust. “But the impact goes much deeper. Often people don’t believe them, employers don’t believe them. But think about how important smell is to communicate.” Dautel said she almost died after leaving her gas hob on. “My partner came back from a run and started screaming at me to get out of the flat.” But smaller things can be dangerous too. “Morrisons are getting rid of the expiry date on milk and say people should be doing the sniff test. But it smells rotten to me anyway.” There is no known cure, and although some parosmics find smell training can be helpful, it is not clinically proven. Dautel remains upbeat. She has started to enjoy food again, 15 months later, and has been trying to describe the indescribable smells she experiences. “It’s been a really long process, but today I ate chicken,” she said. “I’d never have been able to do that six months ago. And it was enjoyable. So there’s hope.”",News/Society,‘Like sewage and rotting flesh’: Covid’s lasting impact on taste and smell,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/30/like-sewage-and-rotting-flesh-covids-lasting-impact-on-taste-and-smell
1/30/2022,"The circumference of Nimo Abdi Duh’s upper arm measures just 12cm and, while the number means nothing to her, it does to the health workers treating her. Nimo, two, like so many children in the arid lowlands of Ethiopia, is suffering from malnutrition. “We have been affected by the drought,” says her mother, Shems Dire, looking anxiously on. “We don’t have milk to give to the children. My child is sick due to lack of food, and this happened because of the drought … Our cattle have been harmed by the drought. We have lost so many.  “We pray to Allah for rain.” In a country already grappling with humanitarian strife brought on by civil war, aid workers and local officials say that another crisis is slowly unfolding, as severe drought plagues much of southern and north-eastern Ethiopia. By mid-March, it is estimated that more than 6.8 million people in the affected regions are expected to be in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. According to Unicef, almost 850,000 children in those areas will be severely malnourished this year due to a combination of drought, conflict and economic downturn. “We have had the failure of three consecutive rainy seasons,” says Gianfranco Rotigliano, Unicef’s country director. “If in April the rain comes, things will get better. But, if not, then we will have something that is comparable to what we saw in 1999 or 1993 to 94.” Those years brought drought-provoked crises to Ethiopia that saw millions go hungry, and some die from starvation. Now, to help get essential supplies to those who most need them, Unicef is appealing for £23.7m, for, among other things, water trucking, the rehabilitation of wells and child nutrition. If that money isn’t raised, Rotigliano warns: “As they say in west Africa, ce sera la catastrophe [it will be a disaster].” With an estimated 4.4 million people facing critical water shortages, the lowlands of Ethiopia’s south-eastern Somali region and parts of Oromia are thought to be most severely affected by the drought. Abdi Farah Ahmed, from the regional health bureau in Jijiga, Somali, says the lack of rainfall – which locally came on top of a locust invasion – caused crops to fail, livestock to die, and malnutrition to rise. Many people had left their homes, he adds. According to a survey in December, more than a fifth of under-fives in Somali are suffering from global acute malnutrition. Abdi Farah says the number of those suffering from severe acute malnutrition (SAM) was also rising. Last year, the average number of people admitted to regional healthcare services with SAM was more than 9,000, he says. “But in December 2021, the number of new SAM cases admitted at the health facilities was 11,588. This means a rise of 18.5% [on the previous month],” he adds. Zainab Wolie, a mother of seven children from Saglo village in the Somali region, says she had been hit hard by the lack of rainfall. She used to sell some of her goats to supplement her income, but she lost almost half of them to the drought. “We depend on our cattle. We lost many of them. Who knows, people may also die next? I haven’t seen such a drought before … Five years ago, there was drought in our area, but at least we had food. But now we don’t have enough food for our family,” she says. She is far from the only one to have suffered the loss of livestock. The land of Saglo is strewn with the carcasses of animals who died in the drought. Cows, sheep, goats, camels and donkeys have perished – and their owners are struggling to survive in their absence. “The situation is desperate,” says Ayes Mohammed, a mother of five from Gebiass village in Somali, who has lost 20 cows and 80 goats and sheep to the drought. “Goats and sheep do not make it. For the cows, there is still some hope if we get fodder soon. I worry about my children. I feed them borrowing food from the neighbours for the last 10 days. But today, I am glad that the government distributed food in our village. I got 20kg of rice and 20kg of sugar.” For Abdirahman Ali Hussein, a healthcare worker in the Korahey zone of Somali, it is clear that the government is not, however, going to be able to deal with the problem alone. The drought is also affecting parts of the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples’ Region in the country’s south-west, and Afar in the north-east, scene of much of the recent fighting between Tigrayan rebel forces and federal government troops. “The government is trying to supply everything but there is overload,” says Abdirahman. Health services were under severe pressure due to the increase in malnutrition and internal migration. “For example, for one health centre we’re [supposed to be] receiving 25,000 people,” he says. “But now with this drought sometimes you can see 40,000 to 50,000 people.” From nutritional support for children and breastfeeding mothers to essential medicines, food, and water, “we need to scale up everything”, he says. People “are suffering, and they need urgent support for everything”. Rotigliano, who was recently in the Somali region, urges donors to give money now before the crisis deepened even further. “When you have the pictures of the children who are, you know, three years old and they weigh three kilos, then everybody is putting the money upfront – but do we really want to get there?” he says.
