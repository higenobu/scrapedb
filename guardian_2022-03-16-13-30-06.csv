3/16/2022,"South Australia’s environment minister has challenged the federal government to “fast-track” Australia’s transition to electric vehicles by matching the state’s subsidy scheme aimed at increasing uptake. Speaking to Guardian Australia, David Speirs said that with a federal election “on the horizon” and an oil price shock caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, there had “never been a better time” to transition to electric cars. “Maybe the need hasn’t been there, hasn’t been so pressing in the past, but it’s certainly pressing now,” Speirs said. “I would certainly like to see the federal government make a contribution towards EV and partner with the state to fast-track that transition. I’m quite comfortable putting the challenge out there to my friends in the federal government.” “I’d love to work with the feds on a subsidy for electric vehicles which matches our own state-based work. At a time when fuel prices are surging, this could be an ideal time to trigger a step change in EV uptake.” The energy minister, Angus Taylor, was contacted for comment. South Australia currently offers a $3,000 subsidy on the sale of new electric vehicles. Similar schemes exist in other states and territories, with the Queensland Labor government announcing on Wednesday that it would introduce its own $3,000 subsidy on EVs cheaper than $58,000 from 1 July. It also announced $10m to build new charging stations. The most generous support has been offered by the New South Wales Liberal government, where drivers can apply to havestamp duty reimbursed on purchases of new and used electric cars that cost up to $78,000, a reimbursement of up to $3,000. They can also claim $3,000 in rebates if they are buying one of the first 25,000 EVs cheaper than $68,750 sold in the state, meaning a buyer could claim back a maximum of approximately $5,540. South Australians will vote at a state election on Saturday about whether to return the incumbent Liberal party to government. Road transport emissions represent the largest and growing share of CO2 emissions in South Australia, where renewable energy penetration is high. While the Liberal government has said it would continue its existing programs and has not made any additional promises going into the election, the Labor opposition has said it will maintain the existing incentives but would repeal the road user charge. Under the current framework, the state government will charge electric vehicle drivers a fee of 2.5 cents for every kilometre they drive until 2027 or when uptake reaches 30%. Scott Morrison was in Western Australia on Wednesday where he announced a $1.3bn Modern Manufacturing Initiative to develop mining projects for critical minerals used in the clean energy and electric vehicle industries. However, the government has not announced any specific measures to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles, and the future fuels and vehicle strategy released in November last year has been considered a wash by industry. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said if elected his government would introduce its own measures – but he would not be drawn on details. “We want to reduce the taxes on electric vehicles and make them cheaper,” Albanese said. “There’s a range of measures that could be looked at in terms of cost of living. We’ll wait and see. We’re not the government now so we can’t – and the government seems determined not to have an election.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Behyad Jafari, from the Electric Vehicle Council, said electric vehicles currently represented about 2% of the new car market in Australia, while in comparable countries they make up 20% of the market. “[The South Australian government] is correct in pointing to the federal government, saying they should be doing more, but that doesn’t let SA off the hook,” Jafari said. “What happens right around the world is state governments contributed about 25% of the support and federal governments provide 75%, so it is a partnership. “The only thing we’d say to SA, and as we’d advised them for a time: what the NSW government has done in this space is much stronger.” Jafari also said the oil price spike, caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, showed Australia should be moving faster. “The federal government absolutely knew something like this was coming,” he said. “We also know this is going to happen again – over several years and throughout our lives. “Why didn’t the government do something before? And now we’re here, what are we going to do now? “You elect a government to recognise this is going to happen, plan for it and avoid it.”",News/Environment,SA environment minister challenges Morrison government to ‘fast-track’ electric vehicle transition,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/16/sa-energy-minister-challenges-morrison-government-to-fast-track-electric-vehicle-transition
3/16/2022,"Ben Roberts-Smith ran an “aggressive intimidation campaign” against witnesses giving evidence to a government war crimes inquiry, a former comrade has told the federal court. The soldier, anonymised before the court as Person 7, also gave evidence Roberts-Smith repeatedly punched and kicked a “terrified” unarmed Afghan prisoner “who posed no threat whatsoever”; bullied other Australian soldiers; and made threats he would “choke a man to death with my bare hands”. Person 7 told the court that, shortly before their first mission on a 2012 deployment – in the days after a comrade had been killed – Roberts-Smith said to him: “Hey mate, I’m going to talk the talk, I want you to make sure I walk the walk. Before this trip’s over I’m going to choke a man to death with my bare hands, I’m going to watch the life drain out of his eyes.” Person 7, a still-serving SAS veteran of more than a quarter of a century in the Australian military, and who deployed 11 times to Afghanistan with the SAS, gave wide-ranging evidence about special forces operations over more than a decade. He told the court he had raised allegations of war crimes committed by Roberts-Smith with SAS senior command as long ago as 2013. Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross and one of Australia’s most decorated soldiers, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. Person 7 was subpoenaed to appear as a witness for the newspapers. In 2015, the Inspector General of the Australian Defence Force conducted an inquiry into allegations of potential war crimes by Australian special forces. That inquiry, the Brereton inquiry, reported in 2020. Soldiers appearing in this defamation proceeding are not permitted to discuss their appearance or evidence before any other inquiry. Person 7 said in 2017 and 2018 he believed Roberts-Smith “conducted an aggressive intimidation campaign of witnesses” who had given evidence to the defence inquiry. Person 7 said at least two comrades received threatening letters he believed to be from Roberts-Smith, and another soldier told him he had been personally pressured by Roberts-Smith to change his testimony. Person 7 said another SAS soldier had his house raided by police after a tipoff on a firearms allegation for which no evidence was found. “RS was disparaging soldiers who were speaking out and speaking up,” Person 7 said, telling the court Roberts-Smith had condemned those soldiers as “cowards” who were jealous, “bitter and twisted” over his decorations. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Person 7 said that motivated him to agree to speak to 60 Minutes about what he had witnessed in Afghanistan: “To be a voice from within.” He said he did not have permission from the military and knew he was breaching defence protocol about speaking to the media. In court on Wednesday, he sought, and was granted, a certificate against self-incrimination on that evidence. Person 7 said he, and other senior soldiers within the SAS, raised issues with the regimental command as early as 2013 about allegations of war crimes being committed by Australian soldiers, about instances of bullying within the SAS, and the erroneous awarding of decorations, including “questions” over Roberts-Smith’s Victoria Cross. “At one point the RSM [Regimental Sergeant Major] said to me, ‘what are you hoping to get out of this?’. I said ‘it’s not what I want to get out of this, it’s what needs to be done’.” Person 7 said in July 2012, he and Roberts-Smith were in the troops’ “ready room” preparing their equipment for battle. Days earlier, SAS Sergeant Blaine Diddams, who was part of the outgoing deployment, had been killed. Person 7 said Roberts-Smith said to him, unprompted: “Hey mate, I’m going to talk the talk, I want you to make sure I walk the walk. Before this trip’s over I’m going to choke a man to death with my bare hands, I’m going to watch the life drain out of his eyes.” Person 7 said he replied: “We’ve got to switch on here RS. We go ‘out the gate’ (of the Australian’s Tarin Kowt base) in a few days.”   Email: sign up for our daily morning briefing newsletter App: download the free app and never miss the biggest stories, or get our weekend edition for a curated selection of the week's best stories Social: follow us on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or TikTok Podcast: listen to our daily episodes on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or search ""Full Story"" in your favourite app In his evidence to the court last year, Roberts-Smith denied making the comment and dismissed the allegation as “ridiculous”. “He’s got a flair for the dramatic,” he said of Person 7. “That is not how I speak. I never have and I never will.” Person 7 told the court he served alongside Roberts-Smith on a 2010 mission to Deh Rafshan area in Uruzgan province, targeting a “medium value” Taliban leader. During the mission, as Australian troops secured a compound, Person 7 said he and another soldier found an unarmed man sitting in the corner of a room. As the Australian soldiers approached him, the man rolled onto his side and “started to make a whimpering-type sound”. Person 7 told the court “this bloke was in serious fear, I couldn’t prise him from the foetal position he had gone into”. “In my assessment he was extremely scared, he posed no threat whatsoever.” He said he wanted to give the man “a moment to calm down” before they tried again to detain him. “At that point, BRS [Roberts-Smith] walked into the room, walked past us, then delivered three to four quickfire punches into the side of the Afghan’s head – then two knees to the Afghan’s chest or stomach area. “I yelled ‘woah, woah, woah, what are you doing? We’re looking after this. Get out of here’.” “RS left the room, he didn’t say anything.” Person 7 told the court Roberts-Smith was wearing kevlar gloves when he assaulted the man, and he saw the man’s face beginning to swell up. In another incident, in 2012, Person 7 said he saw Roberts-Smith repeatedly “jumper-punch” an Afghan man who had been detained, while a small girl, “aged three or four” watched on crying. Person 7 said he asked Roberts-Smith why he was assaulting the man, and Roberts-Smith allegedly replied the man had “hesitated” when Roberts-Smith had asked the man if the girl was his daughter and what her name was. Person 7 said Roberts-Smith told him: “He’s a fucking bad cunt.” Person 7 also told the court Roberts-Smith had bullied fellow Australian soldiers who he regarded as “cowards” or not up to the standards of an SAS soldier. Person 7 said Roberts-Smith repeatedly denigrated some soldiers, and sought to have them removed from service, or taken off deployments. Roberts-Smith, in his evidence, denied ever bullying comrades and allegations that he assaulted any prisoners, or committed war crimes. “I spent my life fighting for my country and I did everything I possibly could to ensure I did it with honour,” he told the court last year. Roberts-Smith said the allegations against him were “false”, “baseless” and “completely without any foundation in truth”. Person 7 remains in the witness box, and will face cross-examination on Wednesday afternoon.",News/Australia news,"Ben Roberts-Smith accused of ‘intimidating witnesses’ to war crimes inquiry, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/16/ben-roberts-smith-accused-of-intimidating-witnesses-to-war-crimes-inquiry-court-hears
3/16/2022,"It was midnight, hours before the floods hit Lismore, and Naomi Moran was in the Koori Mail’s office, working frantically to save an Indigenous institution. The newspaper’s three-storey building, perched perilously close to the swelling Wilsons River, was expected to be flooded, just as it was in 2017. The general manager, Moran, and her team had followed the advice of emergency services to the letter, moving important documents above the then-predicted flood levels. But at midnight, when the true scale of the impending disaster became apparent, Moran, her husband and several friends realised it was not going to be enough. They made a mad dash to the office and were left with just an hour to get all of the newspaper’s computers, hard drives and servers to the third floor. “What was precious to us was what’s on those computers because that’s all our page layouts, basically everything that we need to print a paper,” Moran, a Dunghutti and Nyangbal/Arakwal woman of the Bundjalung nation, tells Guardian Australia. If the third floor were lost, she says, the Koori Mail would be wiped out for up to a year. The loss of the paper for that long would represent a devastating financial blow to Australia’s only fully Indigenous-owned and -managed newspaper, which returns its profits to Aboriginal communities. “I just remember Monday, just monitoring all the reports, trying to see snippets of buildings from helicopter footage on the news to see if we could see the Koori Mail building,” she says. “Just that anxiety around ‘did it get to that third floor?’, that’s all that I was worried about.” It wasn’t until Tuesday that Moran saw the images. The building was hit hard. The first and second floors were both destroyed. The paper’s print archive was among the areas wiped out. “Every single edition in paper printed by the Koori Mail in the last 30 years – completely gone,” Moran says. “There was a $20,000 Albert Namatjira original – probably worth more – floating around there. Just gone.” Thankfully, the third floor was spared. But the damage is such that, for the first time in its 30-year history, the Koori Mail has been forced to temporarily stop publishing. Each issue that doesn’t go to print costs it between $60,000 to $100,000, Moran says. “Thirty years of Koori Mail being the voice of Indigenous Australia and all of a sudden that voice stops,” she says. “It’s obviously affected us as a business and a product as a newspaper, but it’s obviously affecting our readers around the nation that rely on us as a source of information and storytelling, that’s our cultural responsibility and for that to be taken away from us in that way is really tragic.” While the paper gets back on its feet, its staff have found other ways to serve their region. Koori Mail employees quickly organised food and supply drops to nearby Indigenous communities – including around Muli Muli and Tabulam – which lost road access to major population centres. From their underground storage area, the team also set up what they’ve dubbed the “Koori Coles”, a flood relief centre open to Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities alike. “It’s not just about your groceries and your cleaning products, your bedding and your clothes, it’s a holistic approach to what the community needs. We’ve got a medical team here, we’ve got health and wellbeing, we’ve got massage therapists and people doing body work.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “People are going through the most traumatic time in their lives, and a pair of gumboots and a spray bottle is not going to cut it.” Many of the paper’s staff are working and volunteering at a time of immense personal loss. The acting editor, Darren Coyne, lost his home and had to be rescued during the floods. Now he’s now working furiously to get the paper back on track. They hope to resume printing resume in April. “For the first time in history, even though we are 100% self-funded, we need people to hold our hand during this process,” Moran says. “Hold our hand, support where possible, whether it’s contributing to the Koori Mail rebuild fund, taking a bit of pressure off, and making sure we can rebuild our office.”",News/Australia news,One frantic hour: the race to save the Koori Mail from rapidly rising flood waters,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/16/one-frantic-hour-the-race-to-save-the-koori-mail-from-rapidly-rising-flood-waters
