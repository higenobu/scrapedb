2/23/2022,"OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) ‚Äî A U.S. House candidate in Oklahoma has apologized after reports that she became intoxicated at a Valentine's Day weekend sleepover for middle-school-aged girls, berated several of the children and vomited in a hamper. Democrat Abby Broyles, 32, told television station KFOR that she had an adverse reaction after drinking wine and taking sleep medication given to her by a friend. ‚ÄúInstead of helping me sleep, I hallucinated,"" Broyles told the station in a televised interview. ‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt remember anything until I woke up or came to, and I was throwing up in a hamper."" She said she was invited to the slumber party by a good friend from law school who was the mother of one of the girls. Parents and at least one of the girls who were at the sleepover told the online news outlet NonDoc, which first reported the story, that Broyles used profanity and berated several of the 12- and 13-year-old girls at the party, commenting on one girl‚Äôs acne and another‚Äôs Hispanic ethnicity. The parent of one of the girls, Sarah Matthews, tweeted last week that she was disappointed that Broyles had not reached out to the girls to apologize. ‚ÄúFor someone who pontificates to be undyingly pro woman, I am disgusted by your behavior and find it appalling you couldn‚Äôt understand why their parents are angry,‚Äù Matthews wrote. Broyles, who initially denied to NonDoc that she had attended the party, apologized last week during her interview with KFOR, a news channel for which she used to work as a journalist. ‚ÄúI want to say sorry from the bottom of my heart, I apologize for any hurt or damage or trauma that my behavior, when I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing, caused,"" Broyles said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm deeply sorry."" In a statement provided to The Associated Press on Tuesday, Broyles said she doesn't believe she would have said the things she's accused of saying and that she has no plans to drop out of the race. ‚ÄúThe things I'm accused to have said are not who I am. They're not a reflection of my beliefs at all,"" Broyles said. ‚ÄúIt's clear this media smear campaign is politically backed, and I won't stop fighting for Oklahomans."" Broyles, an attorney who was the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate from Oklahoma in 2020, announced last year she planned to run against Republican U.S. Rep. Stephanie Bice for the 5th Congressional District that includes Oklahoma City.",U.S./Associated Press,US House candidate apologizes to girls after sleepover,https://news.yahoo.com/us-house-candidate-apologizes-girls-180249458.html
2/23/2022,"Alexandra Daddario is looking extra strong and fit these days. In a brand new Instagram post, the 35-year-old former Baywatch star is rocking the cutest tennis outfit you ever did see‚Äîand I can't stop myself from staring at her totally sculpted abs, arms, and legs! To stay as fit as she is, Alexandra makes sure to get in some cardio and strength training sessions several times a week. Oh, she's also into boxing and hot yoga. Alexandra Daddario doesn‚Äôt screw around in the fitness department. But the 35-year-old former Baywatch star just shared she‚Äôs thinking of expanding her workout repertoire. Alexandra dropped two new photos of herself on Instagram working a gorgeous tennis outfit from Alo. In the pics, Alexandra layered a black pleated tennis skirt over a black high-cut bodysuit for a look that clearly shows off her tight abs and toned legs‚Äînot to mention those sculpted abs. ‚ÄúNow I just need to learn how to play tennis üéæ,‚Äù she joked in the caption. Naturally, her followers were all about it in the comments: ‚ÄúJust perfect‚ù§Ô∏è,‚Äù one wrote. ‚ÄúPretty woman üíô,‚Äù another said. While Alexandra may not get her kicks on the tennis court just yet, she‚Äôs got plenty of other things going on to keep her fit. Alexandra previously told Health that she picked up some great workout tricks when she trained for her role as a lifeguard in Baywatch. Back then, Alexandra said she ‚Äúwas doing more aerobic activity and way more weight training, which is something I‚Äôve [since] incorporated into my daily routine.‚Äù That said, she‚Äôs scaled back a little bit, noting that she was going at a rate that was ‚Äúnot sustainable‚Äù unless, ya know, it‚Äôs your job. So, while she still does both, she also likes to do a lot of hot yoga and really zeros in on getting her mindfulness fix as she works out. But Alexandra knows how to tear it up at the gym, too. She previously dropped a clip of herself doing an AMRAP workout with her trainer Patrick Murphy on YouTube‚Äîand whoa. Check it out and just try to keep your jaw from hitting the floor: In the video, Alexandra cycled through exercises like lateral raises, reverse lunges, jump squats, push-ups, and stability ball crunches, and kept on going for 20 minutes. In another YouTube video, she got her sweat on alongside her Baywatch co-star Zac Efron‚Äîand even beat him in a sit-up competition. And of course, Alexandra fuels her body well. She likes to focus on easy-to-prep meals, which is why she told Health that her go-to dish is super simple: quinoa, avocado, and chicken breast. ""When I‚Äôm hungry, I want food, like, now, or else I get very cranky,"" she said. And, while she‚Äôs a healthy eater overall, she still makes room for other foods saying that, ""I think you have to indulge or the stress of not being able to enjoy what you eat will detract from any benefits you‚Äôre getting from eating healthy,"" she said. ""Life is really stressful without chocolate."" üëè üëè üëè You Might Also Like PSA: Our Carb-Loving Keto Cookbook Is 32% Off for a Few More Hours This Dynamic Warm-Up Will Help You Prep For Your Best Workout Yet These Before-and-After Photos Show How Much Your Body Can Change From Drinking Less Alcohol",Health/Women's Health,Alexandra Daddario Rocks A Cute 'Fit On IG‚ÄîAnd Her Abs And Legs Are Total #Goals,https://news.yahoo.com/alexandra-daddario-rocks-cute-fit-173900240.html
2/23/2022,"Netflix's Inventing Anna tells a version of the Anna Delvey/Anna Sorokin Soho Grifter story in the form of a limited series. And while the show makes some choices narratively and tonally that are a little bit...off, one thing it generally does very well is cast good actors in good roles. Ozark star Julia Garner doesn't normally look like Sorokin, but she really transforms into the fake heiress for the series‚Äîonce you get used to that accent, it's all smooth sailing. Arian Moayed, best known as Stewy from HBO's Succession, is similarly charismatic and great as Todd Spodek, Anna's lawyer, even if he doesn't entirely look like the real guy. Most of the cast follows suit. Even if Inventing Anna ends up losing you a bit with its questionable character motivations, occasionally strange framing of events, and #Girlboss-ification of its main character, many of the performances are good enough to keep you pressing play on the next episode until the very end. And as you can see when looking side-by-side, the show's casting, wardrobe, and make-up teams all did a bang-up job, because these characters really do wind up looking like their real-life counterparts. Below, you can see a number of the characters in Inventing Anna, compared to the actor portraying them‚Äîand where else you may know that actor from before. Inventing Anna casts Julia Garner as Anna Delvey and Arian Moayed as her lawyer, Todd Spodek. Here's how they compare to their real-life counterparts.",U.S./Women's Health,How The 'Inventing Anna' Cast Looks Compared To Their Real-Life Counterparts,https://news.yahoo.com/inventing-anna-cast-looks-compared-182000273.html
2/23/2022,"Russia's parliament approved treaties with the two breakaway regions in Ukraine's east, a day after Putin announced he was recognising the independence of enclaves controlled by Russian-backed fighters since 2014. ""It is very important for all of us, that peace will finally come to our republic and to Luhansk. We want just peace and calm,"" said Nikolai, a Donetsk resident. ""It is such a bleak environment at the moment. I don't know how good the decision is and if it will lead to peace,"" said Donetsk resident Karina. Russia's recognition of the separatist areas, and Putin's authorisation of ""peacekeeping"" troops there, still stops far short of the massed large scale invasion that Western countries have said for weeks they fear Moscow is planning. It leaves Western leaders guessing as to Putin's intentions for a force of up to 190,000 troops deployed on Ukraine's borders.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Reactions on Donetsk streets after Putin move,https://news.yahoo.com/reactions-donetsk-streets-putin-move-160653918.html
