1/10/2022,"French theatre is gearing up to pay tribute to one of its founding fathers: Molière, the 17th-century playwright whose biting comedies still form many French schoolchildren’s introduction to drama. On 15 January, 400 years after his baptism (the exact date of his birth is unknown), the venerable Comédie-Française company will open this anniversary year with the play that came perilously close to sinking Molière’s career: Tartuffe. While the first version of the play got the approval of Louis XIV himself in 1664, its satire of Catholic zealots drew the ire of the Catholic church. At the time, accusations of impiety could send a playwright to the stake, and Tartuffe was swiftly forbidden. Yet Molière persisted, switching gears and rewriting the play to suggest that his target wasn’t religion or true believers – but rather the hypocrisy of those who feign virtue. (The word “tartuffe” came to describe such characters in life, too.)  It worked. By 1669, a new, longer version of the play – in five rather than three acts – was allowed and met with acclaim, and researchers now see Molière’s political and social acumen as a key factor in his rise to classic status, even before his death. “Molière was brilliant at this: he had this sense of opportunity, a gift for improvisation,” says Georges Forestier, a Molière specialist and professor emeritus at Sorbonne Université in Paris. And this month, thanks to Forestier and his colleague Isabelle Grellet, the Comédie-Française’s audience will be able to experience the original Tartuffe again – or at least a text as close to it as possible. While the 1664 play didn’t survive, the duo used a method that Forestier calls “theatrical genetics” to recreate it. It relies on sources the era’s playwrights drew heavily on, such as commedia dell’arte scenarios and existing short stories, to piece together a play’s original plot. The result is a tighter, more streamlined Tartuffe, focused on the eponymous antihero – a religious beggar who is welcomed into a well-to-do family – and his hosts, Orgon and his wife Elmire. Some characters, such as the young beau Valère, have disappeared entirely along with the second and fifth acts, identified as later additions. The prominent Belgian director Ivo van Hove will direct what is set to be a curious event – a “new” Molière play at the House of Molière, as the Comédie-Française has long been known. The opening night will be relayed live in cinemas in seven countries, and marks the start of a yearlong celebration for the French company, which was born of the fusion of Molière’s troupe and another, in 1680: its entire 2022 lineup will be dedicated to Molière. Van Hove originally considered tackling Tartuffe years ago, after staging Molière’s The Misanthrope and The Miser in other countries, but he was discouraged by the standard five-act version. “It’s so artificially made up, due to the pressure from the church,” he says between rehearsals. “I never liked it, and I didn’t know how to solve it.” Forestier and Grellet’s three-act version convinced him. “It’s what he intended it to be,” Van Hove says of this old-new Tartuffe, presented under its original title (Tartuffe or the Hypocrite, changed in 1669 to The Impostor). The director has added a prologue and epilogue to set the scene, and sees the play as a “social drama”. “This Tartuffe is invited into their home, and then the whole family, every individual, starts to change,” he says. Forestier stresses, however, that while Van Hove sees Tartuffe’s relationship with Elmire, the lady of the house, as a love story, the text doesn’t necessarily support this idea. Ever the pragmatist, Molière knew when to back down – and when to take risks, too. As Tartuffe and the ensuing controversy demonstrate, he was the first comic playwright in France to leave stock comedy characters behind and tap into zeitgeisty themes, including the education of women, freedom within marriage, fanaticism and fashion. And while conservatives disapproved, he found an eager audience in Louis XIV and his court. “When his career takes off, the king is in his 20s,” says Marine Souchier, a postdoctoral researcher who studied the playwright’s career trajectory. “Molière speaks to a pretty young crowd at court and among the bourgeoisie, and is rather progressive for this era.” And Molière, who was also known for his innovative acting, wasn’t averse to stoking controversy in order to generate interest. When his 1662 play The School for Wives came in for relatively mild criticism from some quarters, he seized the opportunity to publicise his work with the help of a friend, Donneau de Visé, who purposefully stoked the flames in articles. Then Molière himself said he would respond – and did do with a new play, The Critique of the School for Wives, in which he ridiculed his detractors. “He kept the buzz going,” Forestier says with a chuckle. According to Souchier, it was an entirely conscious career move – and it paid off: “Thanks to this strategy and his logic of constant innovation, he achieved a level of success that was really unusual at the time, and it cemented the legend after his death.” When Tartuffe returned to the stage in 1669, Molière even anticipated that there was money to be made out of what had become a cause célèbre. “The box-office takings were huge,” Souchier said. “We surmise that Molière’s company set higher prices because they knew it would be sold out.” Four centuries later, expect Van Hove’s Tartuffe, and the many more Molière productions scheduled this year, to pack playhouses again. Tartuffe or the Hypocrite is at the Comédie-Française, Paris, 15 January-24 April and screened by Pathé Live in selected European cinemas on 15 January.",Arts/Stage,Paris’s ‘House of Molière’ wishes happy 400th birthday to French theatre legend,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/10/paris-moliere-french-theatre-tartuffe-comedie-francaise
1/10/2022,"In films and literature they are usually depicted as hulking, foot-stomping, snorting beasts but a new study has claimed that the medieval warhorse was typically a much slighter, daintier animal. A team of archaeologists and historians searching for the truth about the steeds that carried knights into battle has concluded that most were probably only the size of a modern-day pony.  The researchers examined the bones of about 2,000 horses dating from the fourth to 17th centuries found at castles, a medieval horse cemetery and other archaeological sites in England, as well as combing historical records and fictional stories of chivalry. “It turns out that things are not quite as they have usually been portrayed,” said Prof Alan Outram, of the University of Exeter’s archaeology department. “In popular culture, warhorses are often depicted as the size of a shire horse. It really wasn’t like that. Most medieval horses are surprisingly small. There are very few that are the sort of size portrayed in film or even in exhibitions.” Outram said the vast majority of medieval horses, including ones believed to have been used in war, were less than 14.2 hands (4ft 10in) high, the maximum height of a modern pony. One of the biggest they found was a horse from the Norman period, the remains of which were discovered in the grounds of Trowbridge castle in Wiltshire, but it was only 15 hands – the size of a small modern light riding horse. Outram said that size clearly wasn’t the be-all and end-all for medieval warriors. He said that there might well have been some particularly large warhorses but armies would also have needed smaller horses for tasks such as harrying a retreating enemy, carrying out long-range raids and transporting equipment. The research team was keen to spell out they did not mean to imply that medieval horse breeders did not put huge amounts of time, effort and money into their work. “In the 13th and 14th century especially the royal stud was an amazing network,” said Outram. “They were spending much more money on horses than people.” There is still much work to do. The remains of very few, if any, horses have been found on battlefields so working out which animal was a warhorse rather than, say, a farm horse, is difficult. They are also hampered by the fact that most fallen warhorses were hauled off to the knacker’s yard rather than afforded an organised burial. The next steps include analysing findings at a site in Westminster, more study of horse armour and examining the DNA of bones to find out more about one of history’s most iconic creatures.",News/Science,"Medieval warhorses no bigger than modern-day ponies, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/10/medieval-warhorses-no-bigger-than-modern-day-ponies-study-finds
1/10/2022,"Venezuela’s opposition has claimed a rare and highly symbolic victory over Nicolás Maduro’s regime after defeating the government candidate for the governorship of Hugo Chávez’s home state of Barinas. Maduro had hoped his former foreign minister Jorge Arreaza would win control of the region, which is considered the cradle of Chávez’s “Bolivarian revolution”, in Sunday’s election.  The south-western state, where Venezuela’s late president was born and raised, has been governed almost exclusively by relatives of Chávez – his father and two brothers – since he was first elected in 1998. However, Arreaza, who is Chávez’s son-in-law and the father of his grandson, admitted on Sunday night that his bid had failed despite the Socialist party’s “heroic militancy”. Electoral authorities said the little-known victor, Sergio Garrido, had secured 55.4% of votes compared with Arreaza’s 41.3%. “The triumph is for Barinas and all of Venezuela,” Garrido told Reuters. Jubilant supporters streamed through the state capital on motorbikes and gathered at the politician’s campaign headquarters to perform Venezuela’s national anthem, a song that celebrates “the brave people who shook off the yoke”. “Beautiful Barinas – it ends where it began,” tweeted Juan Guaidó, the leader of the failed US-backed campaign to topple Maduro. Henrique Capriles, another key opposition leader, also painted the result as a harbinger of wider change and urged opponents of Maduro, who took power after Chávez’s death in 2013, to unite ahead of presidential elections in 2024. “Only the unity of the people and the solidarity of its leaders guarantee the greatness of nations,” tweeted Capriles, quoting Andrés Bello, the Venezuelan philosopher who taught Simón Bolívar, the independence hero from whom Chávez sought inspiration. Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based analyst for Crisis Group, called the result a massive blow for Maduro’s unpopular administration. “This is not just any state. This is the rural heartland of Chavismo where Chávez himself was born and where his family ruled for over two decades. So, symbolically this is enormously important,” Gunson said. Sunday’s ballot was a re-run of a vote first held last November as part of a nationwide round of gubernatorial and mayoral elections designed to help Maduro regain international legitimacy. In that contest – the first that Venezuela’s mainstream opposition had joined since 2017 – Maduro’s candidates prevailed, winning 19 of 23 governorships. The opposition won three. However, the Barinas election descended into farce after Venezuela’s pro-government supreme court disqualified the politician seemingly poised to defeat the official candidate – Chávez’s brother, Argenis – and ordered another election on 9 January. Argenis Chávez withdrew from the re-run and was replaced by Arreaza, a party heavyweight, as Maduro’s administration battled to ensure victory. “Not only did the government blatantly overturn a legitimate result in November but they then poured everything into Barinas,” Gunson said. “They made sure there was petrol at the filling stations. They were handing out fridges and cookers and cement and doing all the things that they haven’t done in the last 22 years – and they absolutely, totally failed.” Like much of Venezuela, Barinas has been brought to its knees by a crippling economic collapse that has driven an estimated 6 million citizens to flee abroad. The agricultural region has also seen growing opposition to Chavismo, the political movement it helped spawn, although some affection for the late comandante, if not Maduro, remains. During a 2018 visit to Sabaneta, the town where Chávez was born in 1954, the Guardian found a charred statue of him that had been torched by anti-government protesters. One local composer-turned-dissident performed a song denouncing Chávez’s “malignant legacy”. “From here in Barinas, I want to ask my Venezuela for forgiveness. Because … it was here that the disaster began, it was here that the comandante who destroyed my nation was born,” it said.",News/World news,Venezuelan opposition defeats Maduro candidate in Chávez’s home state,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/venezuelan-opposition-defeats-maduro-candidate-hugo-chavez-home-state-barinas
1/10/2022,"The gorse bushes that have invaded many Scottish landscapes could produce enough protein to feed millions of people, according to the leader of a Scottish government research programme. The surprising suggestion by Prof Wendy Russell, at the University of Aberdeen, comes from research on the protein content of invasive plants that have to be doused with herbicides or burned back to keep them under control.  Gorse contains 17% protein and broom has 21% protein, she said, adding: “Gorse and broom were fed to cattle at times when crops failed in the past, so we think protein from these types of plants could be used as animal food. If protein isolates are produced in the correct way, so to be safe, they could be considered as human food in the future.” “The whole point about gorse is it is actively being removed from marginal lands – it’s something we can gain protein from at no extra cost,” she said. “We have a huge amount of gorse all over Scotland and when we did the calculations, just by active removal from marginal land, there’s enough gorse protein to easily feed [Scotland’s] population.” Russell was speaking at a Science Media Centre event on alternative proteins which looked at the health and environmental benefits and drawbacks of alternatives to meat and dairy. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) launched a polling report at the event that showed 60% of people in the UK were willing to try plant-based alternatives to meat and dairy; a third were willing to try lab-grown meat and a quarter were willing to try edible insects. Livestock and fodder production occupies 83% of the world’s farmland but produces only 18% of protein. It also has a very heavy environmental impact, driving the climate crisis and pollution. Studies have shown sharp cuts in meat eating in rich nations are needed to halt global heating. From 1950 to 2000 the global population doubled, but meat intake increased fivefold, said Russell. Continuing this trend in the future is not feasible for the environment, she said: “We really do have to change our diet.” Scotland has little arable land, which is why Russell examined invasive plants on marginal land. “When you make a protein isolate from gorse, 57% of the total leaf protein can be recovered at up to 95% purity,” she said. “We’re using about 4.5 to 6kg of CO2 to produce [a kilogramme of] isolate, compared to an average for meat of 102kg of CO2.” Fifteen Scottish farmers also planted hemp this year for the first time, Russell said. “They’re really concerned about the climate and want to do their best. They really are optimistic about the commercial viability of the crop and its climate credentials.” Russell, who leads the Scottish government’s strategic research programme on food systems and supply, added: “These alternative plant proteins are very healthy, high protein, high in fibre, and high in micronutrients.” Prof Robin May, the chief scientific adviser at the FSA said: “There is a huge potential for novel proteins to have massive benefits in terms of environmental benefit, nutritional benefit, and access of a wider population [to good food]. Our priority is to do everything possible to help businesses get those novel, innovative products safely onto the shelves as swiftly as possible.” May said that while many people were reluctant to try new products, such as lab-grown meat, a quarter said they would change their minds if they were confident it was safe and well regulated. “That’s where we play a key role,” said May. Lab-grown meat went on sale for the first time in December 2020 in Singapore. Proponents say they are produced in clean facilities and do not carry the risk of bacterial contamination of meat from livestock. In the FSA poll, 90% of people said they had heard of plant-based alternatives and 78% said they had heard of lab grown meat. Neil Shah, at the Edison Group investment research firm, which published a report on lab-grown meat on Monday, said: “The cultivated meat industry is booming as a result of increased appetite for ethical and environmentally friendly alternatives to conventional meat. The sector has already begun attracting significant investor interest as it offers the chance to enter an industry which could disrupt the global meat market over the coming decades.” A 2019 report by consultancy AT Kearney predicted that most of the meat people eat in 2040 will not come from slaughtered animals.",News/Environment,"Protein from gorse bushes could feed millions of people, says expert",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/10/protein-from-gorse-bushes-could-feed-millions-of-people-says-expert
1/10/2022,"American democracy suffered two brutal blows on 6 January. The first has been seared into the national psyche: costumed insurrectionists ransacking the US Capitol, attacking Capitol police, and interrupting the constitutionally mandated electoral college count. They got closer than anyone could imagine to Vice-President Mike Pence and other terrified leaders, some hidden behind makeshift office-furniture barricades.  Then, with the marble corridors still stained with blood, 147 elected Republicans maneuvered across broken glass only to vote with the insurrectionists. Around 11pm, a majority of House Republicans voted to reject free and fair election results from Arizona; two hours later, as a weary nation slept, a similar number refused to accept results from Pennsylvania. One year later, it’s the second band of insurrectionists, the ones wearing suits and ties, that pose the most serious threat. The next attempted coup will not be a violent overthrow of the Capitol, but a carefully plotted and even technically legal one, subverting election machinery and exploiting various constitutional loopholes. It is well under way. Its plotters have learned important lessons from last year’s rushed and often-buffoonish dress rehearsal. New laws have been passed by state legislatures under the pretext of halting “election fraud” that will instead abet the next big lie. It’s frighteningly imaginable to see how it succeeds. These are the steps that Republicans are undertaking, now, to create a different outcome next time. 1. Gerrymandering swing-state legislatures. It all begins here. Any effort to change election laws or to argue that legislatures have the power to appoint electors themselves requires Republican control of battleground state legislatures. 2. Restricting access to the polls. In 2021, 19 states enacted 34 laws making it more difficult to cast a ballot. They included 2020’s fiercest battlegrounds, Arizona (decided in 2020 by just 10,457 votes) and Georgia. 3. Capturing electoral administration. Republican legislatures in eight states, sometimes overriding the vetoes of Democratic governors, have claimed partisan control of crucial electoral responsibilities or shifted them away from elected secretaries of state. Georgia Republicans censured Brad Raffensperger, the Republican secretary of state who refused to be cowed by Trump’s attacks on the electoral process, then removed him as chair of the state election board – and seized that power for the legislature itself. Another law gives this board the power to claim control of the vote-counting process in individual counties, such as heavily Democratic Fulton county, home to Atlanta. Arizona barred its secretary of state from representing the state in litigation defending its election code – that is, until 2 January 2023, when the Democrat who currently holds the position leaves office. Texas now requires the governor, lieutenant governor and the house speaker each to sign off on any grants over $1,000 to local election boards, grants having been a popular method of expanding voting access in cities and rural areas in 2020 when states cited financial reasons for shuttering precincts. 4. Pressuring – and criminalizing – the work of election officials. Many new state laws don’t simply make it harder for citizens to vote, they make it tougher for non-partisan election workers to do their jobs. Georgia, Texas and Florida have created civil penalties and fines of up to $25,000 for minor, technical infractions – for the kind of help non-partisan officials offer when needed, or obstructing the view of partisan poll workers – and even opened them to criminal prosecution. According to a Brennan Center and Bipartisan Policy Center study, a third of election workers report feeling unsafe in their jobs. As many as 25% say the toxic, bullying climate could cause them to leave their jobs. Their replacements, in positions that had once been non-partisan, non-competitive and volunteer? The big lie’s truest believers, seeking the offices some believe stole the 2020 election from them. This is a “five-alarm fire”, the Michigan secretary of state, Jocelyn Benson, told the New York Times. 5. Targeting key elections in 2022. The only thing that has prevented Florida/Georgia/Texas-style omnibus voting restrictions in deeply gerrymandered Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania are Democratic governors with veto power. Should Republicans claim those offices in 2022, anything is possible. Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have previously proposed allocating electoral college by congressional district rather than statewide, which would exacerbate the impact of partisan gerrymanders and probably benefit Republicans in otherwise Democratic-leaning states. Under the Wisconsin proposal, Trump would have won eight of 10 electors even though Biden received more votes. Trump has endorsed a former Fox anchor as the next governor of Arizona who he said “will fight to restore Election integrity (both past and future!)”. The two leading Republican candidates for Arizona’s secretary of state, meanwhile, are two state representatives, one of whom attended the 6 January Capitol riot. The other sponsored a bill that would have allowed the legislature to reject the certification of electors, potentially overturning free and fair results. Nationwide, of the top 15 candidates for secretary of state in five crucial battleground states, 10 question the results of the 2020 race. 6. Convincing the base. According to a new NPR/Ipsos poll, two-thirds of Republicans believe that “voter fraud helped Biden win the 2020 election”. In a new University of Massachusetts poll, 71% of Republicans said Biden was not legitimately elected president. A third of Trump voters told NPR they believe the conspiracy theory that the 6 January attack was a false-flag operation by “opponents of Donald Trump, including antifa and government agents”. Trump couldn’t overturn the 2020 results, but he achieved something perhaps nearly as damaging: The “big lie” not only took hold, but it has become sacred to large majorities of angry Republicans convinced that Trump was cheated out of a second term. If this same fealty to phony fraud claims drives Republican elected officials in Congress and state legislatures in 2024, it’s disturbingly easy to imagine competing sets of electors emerging from states won by a Democratic candidate but controlled by a Republican legislature, forcing a constitutional showdown and testing the powers of state legislatures over electors. 7. Ensuring that the courts won’t save us. Beware the Independent State Legislatures doctrine (ISL). ​​Once a stealth effort in Federalist Society legal circles, this extreme reading of the US constitution has as many as four supporters on a US supreme court packed with conservatives. It argues that the constitution gives state legislatures the sole authority to set all election rules – including the assigning of electoral college votes – independently, and immune from judicial review. Taken to its furthest edge, it effectively concludes that there can be no possible checks and balances on state legislatures’ authority when it comes to election law. It might sound bonkers. But in February last year, when the US supreme court dismissed as moot a challenge to Pennsylvania’s absentee ballot extension, three justices dissented and cited the ISL. If 2020 repeats itself in 2024 – a Democratic candidate with a 7 million-vote edge in the popular vote, the same slender margins in Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin, and embittered Republicans controlling gerrymandered legislatures – it’s hard to imagine the system holding quite the way it did, just barely, a year ago. Of course, Republicans could always win the 2024 election outright. But make no mistake: with preparations like this, they’re ready either way. They have almost three years to perfect this playbook. Those of us who believe in American democracy have much less time left to prevent it – and a much more complicated road.

1/10/2022,"Protesters opposed to Covid regulations pelted a French MP with seaweed and stones outside his home on the overseas territory of Saint Pierre and Miquelon at the weekend. Stéphane Claireaux, a member of the governing La République en Marche (LREM) said he had made an official police complaint after the attack, which fellow MPs described as a “lynching”.  Claireaux said he had gone outside to speak to the protesters who were angry about the decision by local authorities to impose the “health pass”. When his wife joined him she was also attacked, he said. The rule was announced by the state representative, the prefect, on 2 January and has angered residents of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, an overseas territory in the north-west Atlantic near Canada. In mainland France, the health pass, or pass sanitaire, has been in effect since last summer, and requires people to have been vaccinated, have recovered from coronavirus or have a negative Covid test to access public places including bars, cafes, restaurants, museums, theatres and long distance trains. Proposed legislation is going through parliament to tighten these restrictions and introduce a “vaccine pass”. If passed, it would make access to many public places conditional on a person being fully vaccinated. “I will be complaining to the police, that’s a given,” Claireaux told France Info radio on Monday. He said he was waiting in front of his house to talk to the demonstrators when they began pelting him. “There was a car loaded with seaweed and people started throwing it in my face. It was like a stoning,” he continued. My wife came to meet me on the front steps of the house. I dodged a pebble that missed our faces by about 5cm,” he added. The vaccine pass bill was passed by a large majority on first reading by the national assembly (lower house) last week after a bitter debate. It is being considered by the senate before it returns to the national assembly for a final vote. If it is approved, the government says the law will come into effect on 17 January. Annick Girardin, the minister of the sea, denounced the “attack” on Claireaux, saying he had been on the receiving end of “numerous projectiles violently thrown at his face followed by stone throwing”. Marc Fesneau, another minister, said: “The cowardice of targeting a single, peaceful and defenceless man who was attacked in front of his own home. “An intolerable line has been crossed.” Sébastien Lecornu, the minister for France’s overseas territories, said Claireaux had been “lynched in front of his family home”. Lecornu said he and Gérald Darmanin, the interior minister, had “instructed the prefect of Saint Pierre and Miquelon to ensure the protection of the deputy”. Christophe Castaner, the head of the LREM group in the national assembly, said there had been 322 threats against MPs in 2021. There have been numerous reports attacks on MPs and their property. Cars and garages have been set alight, property covered with graffiti as well as MP receiving intimidating messages including death threats. More than 100,000 protesters rallied across France on Saturday against further restrictions on the unvaccinated. The protests attracted four times the number of those held in December, according to government estimates, and came after the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he wanted to “piss off” those who refused to have the vaccine by making their lives more difficult.

1/10/2022,"Elon Musk’s satellite internet company, Starlink, has ambitious plans to bring internet access to people anywhere in the world. But it turns out the venture is providing another service: warming up cats.  A customer tweeted a photo of five cats huddled on his Starlink dish, which links homes to more than a thousand satellites, and noted that the presence of the furtive felines had slowed his internet performance. “Starlink works great until the cats find out that the dish gives off a little heat on cold days,” Aaron Taylor said. After the photo was widely shared online, Taylor clarified that the cats had taken to the dish by choice, rather than necessity. “They have a heated cat house, with water and food, but -25C and they decide to sit on the Starlink dish. When the sun goes down, they head back to their house,” he said. Starlink works great until the cats find out that the dish gives off a little heat on cold days. pic.twitter.com/uyH3Kbqrie The attraction may be due to a “self-heating” feature on the dish which is designed to melt snow. In 2020, Starlink engineers touted efforts to “upgrade our snow melting ability”. Taylor said the cats’ attraction to his Starlink dish interrupted movie streaming and affected internet speed. “Doesn’t shut it down completely but definitely slows everything down,” he said. He also said he planned to move the dish from the ground to a higher location. Starlink, a division of Musk’s SpaceX company, has launched more than 1,600 satellites. The company, which has permission from US authorities to launch up to 12,000 satellites, says the service is “ideally suited for areas where connectivity has been unreliable or completely unavailable”. The apparent attraction of Starlink dishes to cats has not been the only hiccup, however. In December, China accused the US of ignoring international treaty obligations after the Tiangong space station was nearly struck by Starlink satellites. Tiangong had to take “preventive collision avoidance control” during two “close encounters”, China wrote in a note to the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space. The note said the incidents “constituted dangers to the life or health of astronauts onboard the China space station”, and asked the UN secretary general “to circulate the above mentioned information to all states parties to the outer space treaty”.",News/Technology,Cat on a hot satellite dish: Elon Musk’s Starlink antenna hits surprise problem,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/10/starlink-satellite-dish-cats-elon-musk
1/10/2022,"Boris Johnson has said the government is “looking at the science” of moving to an isolation period of five days instead of seven for a positive Covid case, after calls to ease staffing shortages across the economy. The prime minister confirmed the government was examining the proposal, after several cabinet colleagues made clear they would like to see a shift to five-day isolation if possible.  Asked about the issue on a visit to a vaccine clinic at a pharmacy in his Uxbridge constituency, Johnson said: “The thing to do is to look at the science. We are looking at that and we will act according to the science.” The debate arose after the US shifted its isolation requirements to five days after a positive test. The situation in the UK is different, as isolation in symptomatic cases begins from the start of symptoms rather than a test, but some senior Tories are pressing for a cut from seven to five days in asymptomatic cases at least, where isolation begins from the point of a positive test. The government has sounded a cautious note until now, since it only recently cut isolation requirements from 10 days to seven days for asymptomatic cases if a person tests negative by lateral flow on days five and six of isolation. However, the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, broke ranks to say on Sunday that a move to five-day isolation would be “helpful” if it were supported by the evidence. The Telegraph reported that Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, takes a similar position. Speaking on his visit to the vaccine centre, the prime minister also pledged that free lateral flow tests would be available for “as long as it is necessary” after reports over the weekend that individuals and businesses would soon have to pay for them. Johnson’s official spokesperson also stressed that free lateral flows would stay for the time being. “There’s absolutely no plans to change that,” he said. “We will use testing as long as necessary. It’s a vital line of defence alongside our vaccine programme. With cases high across the country there’s no doubt that the use of lateral flow devices are both disrupting chains of transmission and saving lives. We’ve got 425m tests coming in January, as we’ve set out. “Those of you who read through the autumn and winter plan will know that we set out then that at a later stage, as the government’s response to the virus changes, universal free provision of these tests will end. I think that’s what the public would expect.” He also said it was too early to say whether the UK was in the process of moving from a pandemic stage of Covid to an endemic stage, after Zahawi suggested the UK should show the rest of the world how to get back to normal. Michael Gove, the levelling up secretary, set out a similar view in his broadcast interviews on Monday morning, as he said the country was moving to a stage where it could “live with Covid”. Having previously argued for caution around Omicron, the senior cabinet minister said the easing of restrictions would have to be guided by science, but “the sooner the better”. He told Sky News: “We are moving to a situation, we’re not there yet, but we are moving to a situation where it is possible to say that we can live with Covid, and that the pressure on the NHS and on vital public services is abating.” The UK Health Security Agency estimates that 10-30% of people who self-isolate after a positive Covid test are still infectious on day six, dropping to about 5% after day 10. Their modelling suggests a similar risk of being infectious – about 5% – if people end isolation after two negative tests on days six and seven. The work underpins the existing guidance on Covid isolation, but the thinking may change as more data come in on Omicron. Preliminary findings from Japan’s National Institute of Infectious Diseases hint that people who have asymptomatic Omicron infections may stop shedding the virus sooner than those who have symptoms. This is not unexpected, but the study includes only 21 cases, so the results are considered tentative. The researchers took 83 respiratory specimens from 21 people infected with Omicron. Only two of the people were unvaccinated and four had no symptoms. Tests showed that people shed most virus three to six days after either diagnosis or the onset of symptoms, with the amount falling gradually from then on. While those with Covid symptoms harboured infectious virus until day 10, the researchers did not obtain any infectious virus from the four asymptomatic people beyond day five. The scientists are cautious about the results, concluding only that vaccinated people with Omicron are unlikely to shed infectious virus 10 days after diagnosis or the onset of symptoms.",News/World news,"Ministers considering cutting Covid isolation to five days, says Boris Johnson",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/ministers-considering-cutting-covid-isolation-to-five-days-says-boris-johnson

Djokovic’s father Srdjan said: “Over the past few days, it’s been very, very difficult for everyone in the world who is free thinking. But he is mentally extremely, extremely strong. They took away all his rights his rights, as a human being. He refused to revoke his visa. They gave him no right to prepare his defence for several hours, and they took away his phone. Fortunately they gave him back his phone. He contacted his legal team who mounted a fantastic defence, that they could not match. “This is a huge win for Novak, his family and the free world. He respected everything that was asked of him. He only wanted to go there to play tennis and that right he wanted to take away from them. Justice and the rule of law have prevailed. The judge who presided over the case has shown that not for second was Novak the guilty party. The judge was fantastic, he simply respected the facts. He took the only decision that was possible which was to release Novak.” Djordje Djokovic said his brother had gone immediately back to the tennis court to renew training as he pursues a 10th Australian Open title. “Novak is free … he came to Australia to play tennis, to try and win another Australian Open.”  More to follow",Sport/Sport,‘Grateful’: Novak Djokovic thanks judge and takes to tennis court after release,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/10/grateful-novak-djokovic-thanks-judge-and-takes-to-practice-court-after-release-tennis
1/10/2022,"West Ham are hopeful that Kurt Zouma will boost their push for Champions League qualification by returning ahead of schedule from a hamstring injury.  David Moyes has been considering whether to sign a new defender after losing both of his first-choice centre-backs to serious injury before Christmas. Angelo Ogbonna was ruled out for the rest of the season after having surgery on an anterior cruciate ligament injury in November and West Ham’s selection problems increased when Zouma, who has been outstanding since his £29.8m move from Chelsea last summer, damaged a hamstring tendon against his former club at the start of last month. There were fears that Zouma was going to be out for up to three months, leaving West Ham reliant on Craig Dawson and Issa Diop for a prolonged period, but the Frenchman’s swift recovery could convince Moyes to alter his transfer plans this month. The former Chelsea defender is expected to return to training soon and will be hopeful of proving his fitness before the east Londoners visit Manchester United on 22 January, although the trip to face Kidderminster Harriers in the fourth round of the FA Cup at the start of February could be a more realistic target. However, West Ham, who have not been as defensively sound without Zouma and Ogbonna, could still look for a defender. Dawson has been playing with an injury – Aji Alese and Jamal Baptiste are inexperienced alternatives – and Moyes has been tracking Liverpool’s Nat Phillips and Bournemouth’s Lloyd Kelly. It is understood that a move for Burnley’s James Tarkowski, who is out of contract at the end of the season, is increasingly unlikely this month. West Ham, who are fifth in the Premier League before hosting Norwich City on Wednesday, could decide that they need extra depth given that they are in the last 16 of the Europa League. They have also considered bringing in cover at left-back, with Aaron Cresswell yet to return from the back injury he sustained against Manchester City in November. However, Cresswell should be fit soon and West Ham feel that Lucas Digne, who is out of contract at Everton, is too expensive. Other than defensive reinforcements West Ham want a striker to provide competition for Michail Antonio. Blackburn’s Ben Brereton Díaz is on their radar, although an asking price of £25m for the Chile forward could prove prohibitive this month. Jarrod Bowen, whose sixth goal of the season helped West Ham knock Leeds out of the FA Cup on Sunday, is not worried about whether his form leads to his first England call-up. “I think this season was about progression and getting the call up for England is the ultimate dream,” the forward said. That is out of my hands. My job is to deliver on the pitch and show what I am about. If it happens then it happens. I can only control what I am doing. It is not on my mind. The more you think about these situations which are not in your control, the more it plays on your mind and affects you.”",Sport/Football,West Ham optimistic Kurt Zouma to return from injury ahead of schedule,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/10/west-ham-optimistic-kurt-zouma-to-return-from-injury-ahead-of-schedule
1/10/2022,"Afghans who fled the Taliban risk dying in freezing temperatures in Calais, NGOs have warned. People who left Afghanistan after the US withdrawal this summer have started to arrive in northern France in the hope of reaching the UK by crossing the Channel in dinghies. But charities have raised the alarm that conditions are deteriorating sharply, putting thousands of lives at risk.  A combination of freezing temperatures, increasingly forceful evictions of refugees from makeshift shelters by police and cuts to funding for charities working on the frontline has created a perfect storm, the organisations said. A legal challenge is under way against Priti Patel’s plans to use jet skis to turn back small boats mid-Channel. The Times has reported Home Office sources as saying the controversial pushback tactics could be used for the first time this month. While thousands were airlifted out of Afghanistan to safety in the UK when the Taliban took over, many others were forced to make the same hazardous journey across land and sea as those fleeing persecution in countries such as Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Syria, Yemen and Somalia. Charities say that at least 150 evictions have taken place by police in northern France since Christmas. Care4Calais has reported that some of the refugees they work with have been injured by teargas, rubber bullets and batons used by the French police during evictions. The French authorities have said that more than a dozen of their officers have been injured during these evictions. The French authorities are issuing increasingly long lists of roads where charities are not allowed to distribute food and other essentials to refugees. The celebrity-backed funder Choose Love pulled the plug on £600,000 of funding to organisations providing food, water, blankets and other essential aid to refugees in northern France at the end of last year, with the charities affected warning they may be forced to close. Louis Woodhead, facilitator with Calais Food Collective, said: “The lack of certainty about future finding means we will have to start rationing how much food we distribute. People here are already exposed to police brutality, human rights abuses and have no safe way to claim asylum in the UK. It is already a humanitarian crisis and if we’re forced to cut services the situation is only going to get worse.” Imogen Hardman, operations manager for Care4Calais in northern France, said the situation was dire and deteriorating. “The weather is awful at the moment. It’s incredibly cold. We are trying to ensure that people have access to tents, sleeping bags, boots and warm clothes. Police are evicting every 48 hours. Trees are being cut down and land cleared across a lot of different living sites, meaning that people have no shelter and the land becomes more muddy. We are seeing an increase in the Afghan community here, people who fled after the Taliban took over have now arrived in Calais. Every single person here is a human being who has experienced really horrible things.” A 15-year-old refugee from Sudan called Yousef said he had been sleeping behind the French supermarket Auchan in Calais. He said: “Sometimes we have a tent if the police don’t take it. If we have firewood we cook with whatever we can find, scraps or anything. We use tins to cook in as the police take the pans charities give us. I try to cross the Channel most nights. If I can get to England most of all I want to go to school.”",News/World news,"Afghans risk dying in freezing temperatures in Calais, charities warn",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/10/afghans-risk-dying-in-freezing-temperatures-in-calais-charities-warn
1/10/2022,"The number of knitters in the UK has jumped by around one million since the start of the pandemic, according to the UK Hand Knitting Association (UKHKA), with people taking up the meditative hobby through lockdowns. The rise in people picking up knitting needles in 2021 has partly been put down to the ‘Tom Daley’ effect, which has seen the number of male knitters increase since the Olympic athlete was seen making a jumper at the Tokyo Games. The UKHKA says the proportion of men using its site has risen from 10 to 25% since the Olympics.  We would like to hear from people in the UK who have started knitting in the last couple of years, including those influenced by Daley. What does the hobby offers you?
