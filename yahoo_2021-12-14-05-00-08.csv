12/14/2021,"Authorities so often wrongfully blame TikTok for starting real-life trends that it has become a joke to young people. But this time, a TikTok trend really has become a nuisance. To the tune of “Die Young” by Kesha, users have been pounding twice on doors with their fists or feet. Then they run away as fast as possible to avoid getting caught. It’s like “ding-dong ditch” for the digital age. Two🐤 one stone #fyp #college Most videos take place in dorm halls, but there have been enough instances of frightened homeowners in various neighborhoods that police had to step in. According to Fox News, Jennifer Pritchard of the Petaluma Police Department in Petaluma, California, said the prank presents a real danger to homeowners who aren’t familiar with the trend. It could become “a real life-or-death situation” if someone thinks their door is being kicked down in a home invasion. “You don’t know what ways they’ll protect [themselves] that could cause real, real harm,” she told the site. “When people think their home or their family is threatened, they are going to give an equal response to protect their property or family.” got caught later #knock #knockingchallenge The local Fox affiliate in Orlando reported that a woman named Denise Marrs experienced “absolute terror.” While she was watching TV with her family, she heard someone kicking on the door. “It was terrifying. I mean, I can’t even express how scary it was,” she told the station. Her husband Doug said he went into “fight mode” — until they looked back on Ring doorbell footage and realized the whole thing might have been a prank. “We used to do a doorbell ditch type of thing, but I think this is way worse than that,” Doug said. “It’s not funny. You could have gotten hurt, we could have gotten hurt, some other houses … you probably would have gotten hurt.” Days later, the Lincoln Police Department received several complaints from residents saying someone kicked their doors, according to Fox Nebraska.

12/14/2021,"A golf course employee who serves drinks to the golfers has revealed the bizarre tip she received from a man on the course in an effort to convince her to get dinner with him. Cassie Holland, who works as a beverage cart driver in Las Vegas, Nevada, recalled the encounter in a TikTok uploaded in September, where she revealed that the man gave her three $100 bills that were ripped in half, and promised to give her the other halves if she showed up for dinner. Holland, who goes by the username @cassholland on TikTok, began the video by explaining that she was sharing the story because she wanted to know if it had ever happened to anyone else. The golf course employee then held up three $100 bills that had been ripped in half as she said: “What the hell is this? Three hundred dollars in half.” “So, how did we get here? You’re probably thinking someone tried to trick me and short me but oh no. This man had bigger plans in mind,” Holland continued, before recalling how the man in question had been buying drinks for himself and his friends and was “tipping good” and “being really nice” during their first encounter. However, according to Holland, at that point, the man had claimed he was from out of town and asked her to go to dinner with him, an invitation which she said she declined. After urging Holland to cancel her plans, the man then took out the ripped money, with the golf cart driver recalling how he’d offered her the money and promised to give her the other halves if she met him in front of a casino at 9pm that night. “So clearly he already had this whole idea planned out,” Holland said in the clip, before revealing that she had again declined the offer. So does this = $150?.... #cartgirl #golfer #golftiktok #golf #golflife #CinderellaMovie However, according to Holland, once she got back in her cart, she noticed that the man had left the destroyed money in her drink holder. “Now I have this completely useless $300,” she said. “Just $300 down the drain that nobody can use because I’m not going.” Holland then revealed that she was mad at first over the situation, but ultimately concluded that the golfer is the “dumba** that lost $300, before admitting that she doesn’t know how to handle the situation. “So now I don’t know what to do,” she continued. “I wonder if he’s ever done this before and it’s worked ‘cause I can understand once you have the three halves you probably want the other ones. “It’s funny, because he probably thinks he’s a genius, but he really just lost $300 for nothing.”    A post shared by @americandreamhoney The clip, which has been viewed more than 1.7m times, sparked a range of replies in the comments, with some viewers urging Holland to take the money to the bank. “If it’s more than 50 per cent the bank will usually take it,” one person commented, while another said: “You should take those to the bank.” Others revealed that they have found themselves in similar situations, with someone else writing: “It happens to me all the time.” “Happened to me too when bartending!” another viewer added. The video also prompted comments from viewers disgusted by the man’s behaviour and “audacity”. In a follow-up video, Holland revealed that the man who’d given her the ripped money had shown up at the golf course again, with the golf course employee claiming that he gave her the rest of the money after admitting that he’d seen her TikTok video.    A post shared by @americandreamhoney “Turns out he saw my video and realised what he did wasn’t very smart,” Holland said as she held up the bills that had been taped together. “Yes, he came back to play today and decided he would give me the other halves this time.” According to Holland, when the man gave her the money, he told her he felt it was a good use of the money if she was going to do “something fun with it,” while she revealed in the clip that she was considering using the tip to pay bills. Holland also said the golfer had again invited her out, but that she had decided not to show up again. Golfer reveal? #golf #golfer #cartgirl #golftiktok #CurameChoreo “And buddy, if you’re watching this, thank you but, like I said to you before, I’m going to be accepting this as an inconvenience fee,” Holland concluded. The beverage cart employee was praised by viewers for her handling of the situation, with one person writing: “When I tell you my JAW DROPPED. This is a power move.” The Independent has contacted Holland for comment.

12/14/2021,"A Pennsylvania man who planted bombs at a Black Lives Matter protest in 2020 won’t spend any more time in jail after a district court judge sentenced him on Monday to time served and three years of probation. Matthew Michanowicz, a 53-year-old Pennsylvania man, admitted he planted a backpack of explosives in downtown Pittsburgh hours after a Black Lives Matter protest in the days following George Floyd’s death last year. None of the three bombs exploded, but prosecutors say they could have hurt or killed people if they detonated. Judge Donetta W. Ambrose sentenced Michanowicz on time served for the 18 months he’s spent behind bars while awaiting trial, and three years of supervised release, starting with the first 180 days in home detention. Michanowicz faced up to 10 years in prison for charges of illegal possession of an unregistered destructive device. Defense attorney Ken Haber told The Washington Post Ambrose may have considered Michanowicz’s mental state when she handed down the lighter sentence. “I think the judge was somewhat convinced that he had a breakdown,” Haber said. The attorney said. Michanowicz was stressed at the time that he planted the devices and didn’t intend for them to detonate or harm anybody, his defense claimed. On May, 31, 2020, six days after former Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin murdered Floyd, and one day after a Black Lives Matter protest turned destructive in downtown Pittsburgh, Michanowicz rode his bike to the area. He left a camouflage backpack containing three explosive devices on 2 PNC Plaza. The next morning, police responded to the plaza over a report of a suspicious bag. Inside the bag were three “homemade Molotov cocktails,” police said. Michanowicz had filled three pepper-spray containers with gasoline and stuck wicks inside. Surveillance footage showing a man carrying the bag pointed police in Michanowicz’s direction. Days later, an officer spotted Michanowicz in the same area where the backpack was found. He admitted he was the man seen on surveillance footage. Agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives searched Michanowicz’s home and found more materials similar to the ones used to make the devices, and 10 camouflage backpacks like the one planted at the scene. Michanowicz pleased guilty in August 2021 to placing the bag filled with explosive devices at the plaza. Around the time of the incident, Michanowicz had been having a difficult time, according to Haber. He’d recently lost his job as a medical salesman and his father and close friend had just died. “This is the product of someone who was a highly successful person who had a bit of a breakdown,” Haber said. Across the country, protesters have been sentenced to prison time for their roles in the demonstrations that spread across the country last year. Shamar Betts, 20, was sentenced to four years in federal prison in August on charges of inciting a riot after he posted a provocative flyer on social media before a protest turned destructive in Salt Lake City, Utah. From May to October of 2020, prosecutors filed more than 300 charges related to protests, according to The Prosecution Project. Social media users criticized Michanowicz’s sentence. There exists two justice systems. These people will succumb to violence again – their excuse “a bad day.”“Michanowicz’s lawyer, Ken Haber, told The Post in a phone interview that the judge might have considered his client’s recent mental health issues and personal struggles.” https://t.co/qgHjbZb6I7 — Master of 10.5 FXR (@DatHandsomeJerk) December 7, 2021 Matthew Michanowicz was planning to make a bomb to use on BLM protestors and gets off.This is why we need better Criminal Justice Reform.He is a domestic terrorist. https://t.co/uFdBsMJqGZ — Reggie T. #Blacklivesmatter (@sketchygothandz) December 8, 2021 Matthew Michanowicz planted 2 bombs to kill people in Pittsburgh, He pleaded guilty and got released on probation instead of getting 10 years in prison.
