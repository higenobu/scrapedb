4/10/2022,"As America slouches toward the midterm elections, you need an economic message that celebrates your accomplishments to date – job creation and higher wages – yet also takes aim at the major abuses of economic power that remain in the system, fueling inflation and widening inequality. You should put these 10 indisputable facts center stage: 1. Corporate profits are at a 70-year high. Yet corporations are raising their prices. 2. They are not raising prices because of the increasing costs of supplies and components and of labor – which are real but expected when an economy goes suddenly from a pandemically induced deep freeze due to meeting the soaring demands of consumers who are emerging from the pandemic. Corporations enjoying record profits in a healthy competitive economy would absorb these costs. 3. Instead, they’re passing these costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices. In many cases they’re raising prices higher than those cost increases, using the cover of inflation to increase their profit margins even more. 4. They’re doing so because they face little or no competition. If markets were competitive, companies would keep their prices down to prevent competitors from grabbing away customers. As the White House National Economic Council put it in a December report: “Businesses that face meaningful competition can’t [maintain high profit margins and pass on higher costs to consumers], because they would lose business to a competitor that did not hike its margins.” 5. Since the 1980s, two-thirds of all American industries have become more concentrated. This concentration gives corporations the power to raise prices because it makes it easy for them to informally coordinate price increases with the handful of other companies in their same industry – without risking the possibility of losing customers, who have no other choice. 6. Corporations are using these near-record profits to boost share prices by buying back a record amount of their own shares of stock. (Buybacks reduce a company’s shares outstanding, pushing its profit-per-share figure higher.) Stock buybacks hit a new record last year. So far this year they’re on track to exceed that record. In the first two months of 2022, S&P 500 companies have disclosed authorizations to buy back $238bn in stock – a record pace, according to Goldman Sachs, which expects $1tn of buybacks this year – an all-time high. Chevron engaged in $1.4bn in stock buybacks and spent $500m more on shareholder dividends than it did in 2020. This year, the oil giants are planning to buy back at least $22bn more. 7. Most American workers have barely had a wage increase in 40 years (adjusted for inflation). Although corporations have recently given out wage increases in response to the post-pandemic surge in demand, these wage increases have been almost completely eroded by price increases. Corporations are handing out wage increases to attract or keep workers with one hand, and then eliminating those wage increases by raising prices with the other. When corporations are enjoying near-record profits, we would expect corporations to pay the higher wages out of their profits rather than to pass them on to consumers in higher prices. But they are not. The labor market is not “unhealthily” tight, as Jerome Powell asserts; corporations are unhealthily fat. Workers do not have too much power; corporations do. 8. As a result of all this, income and wealth are being redistributed upward from average working people (many of whom live from paycheck to paycheck) to CEOs and shareholders, including the wealthiest people in America. Billionaires have become $1.7tn richer during the pandemic. CEO pay (based largely on stock values) is now at a record 350 to 1 ratio relative to median pay. 9. Wealthy Americas are now paying a lower tax rate than the working class. Some are paying no taxes at all. 10. Big corporations have accumulated a substantial amount of political power, with which they’ve beaten back lower drug prices, prevented higher corporate taxes, and amassed unprecedented corporate welfare. In short, although the American economy is rebounding nicely from recession, the growing imbalance of economic power is bad for most Americans and for the economy as a whole. It must be addressed through (a) tougher antitrust enforcement, (b) a temporary windfall profits tax, (c) higher taxes on the wealthy and on corporations, (d) a ban on corporate buybacks, (e) stronger unions, and (f) campaign finance reform to get big money out of politics. You have a critical opportunity to reframe the national conversation as it should be framed – around these worsening abuses of economic power by large corporations and the super-rich. Republicans have left themselves vulnerable because they have no response to this. They believe their “culture wars” will distract the public from what’s going on. This is not and should not be a partisan issue. Average working Americans – many of whom voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020 – are being shafted.

4/10/2022,"The mayor of London has thanked the outgoing Metropolitan police commissioner, Dame Cressida Dick, for four decades of “dedicated public service” on her final day in the role. Dick resigned following Sadiq Khan’s public criticism of her handling of a group of police officers based at Charing Cross police station who had shared racist, homophobic and misogynistic messages on WhatsApp. Other scandals, including the heavy-handed policing of a vigil for Sarah Everard, who was murdered by a serving Met officer, are thought to have contributed to the decision. Her resignation in February came just hours after she said she had no intention of quitting. In a statement, Khan said: “I would like to thank Dame Cressida Dick again for almost four decades of dedicated public service, with the vast majority spent at the Met, where she was the first woman to become commissioner. In particular, I commend her for the recent work in helping us to bring down violent crime in London.” He said he would not support the appointment of a new commissioner who “doesn’t understand or acknowledge the scale of the challenge facing policing”. “I’m now working with the home secretary on the recruitment of a new commissioner,” he said. “I’ve been clear that I won’t support the appointment of anyone who doesn’t understand and acknowledge the scale of the challenge facing policing. Regaining the trust and confidence of London’s communities is crucial to policing by consent and making our city safer.” Dick will take unused annual leave until her final day of official employment on 24 April. It is understood she will receive a severance payment of £166,000, the majority of which is related to a six-month notice period plus an additional payment of two months’ salary. On Friday Dick warned against the “politicisation of policing”, saying it was “a threat not just to policing but to trust in the whole criminal justice system”. “The current politicisation of policing is a threat not just to policing but to trust in the whole criminal justice system,” she wrote in a “letter to London”. “Operational independence from local and central government is crucial for an effective democracy and is a model respected around the world. We must all treasure and protect it.” The deputy commissioner, Sir Stephen House, will serve as acting commissioner while the recruitment process continues. It is expected to take up to five months.",News/UK news,Sadiq Khan thanks Cressida Dick on final day as Met commissioner,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/10/sadiq-khan-thanks-cressida-dick-final-day-met-police-commissioner
4/10/2022,"The Friuli-Venezia Giulia region in the north-east of Italy in the year 1900 is a place still rooted in enchantment and superstition, coexisting with the heady influence of Catholicism. Pregnant for the first time, Agata (Celeste Cescutti) performs a ritual blood-letting into the tidal water that surrounds and nurtures her seaside village community, in the belief that it will protect her from misfortune. But tragedy strikes anyway, and Agata’s child is stillborn. Against the wishes of her husband, Agata sets out on a journey cross country in the hope that she can save her child’s soul from purgatory. With its colour palette of mossy greens, terracotta and earth tones, and its matter-of-fact approach to themes of folklore and mysticism, this gorgeous first feature from Italian director Laura Samani is as enchanting as it is unusual.

4/10/2022,"“Donne, for not keeping of accent, deserved hanging.” Ben Jonson’s stern judgment on his contemporary, the metaphysical poet, cleric and scholar John Donne, was mitigated by his concession that he was “the first poet in the world for some things”. Nearly four centuries after his death, Donne remains a man of his age and a thoroughly contemporary figure, whose love of ambiguity and paradox, in life and art alike, baffles and thrills. From a young age, as we learn from Katherine Rundell’s masterly new biography Super-Infinite, Donne was consumed by ideas of identity. The challenge for any biographer is to delve into the apparent contradictions between the two Donnes, the piratical Jack who sailed with Raleigh to Cadiz and who wrote brilliant sonnets, rich in witty paradox and bold sexual assertion, and the prelate Dr John, who eventually became dean of St Paul’s; an accomplishment, Rundell tells us, that owed as much to his networking skills as it did to his considerable ability at preaching. His show-stopping sermons, delivered with theatrical relish, were as much of a draw as any play at the nearby Globe. Yet Donne also spent his life afraid, preoccupied with potential damnation and more earthly concerns. He was born and baptised a Catholic at a time when the faith was regarded with fear and suspicion, and his younger brother Henry, imprisoned in Newgate for harbouring a Catholic priest, died in 1594. He abandoned his former religion for practical and ideological reasons, and felt that he had betrayed himself in the process. As he later wrote of his relationship with God: “I, like an usurped town, to another due/ Labour to admit you, but Oh, to no end.” Perhaps inevitably, he even preached his own funeral sermon, Death’s Duel, dragging his ailing body into the pulpit at St Paul’s in February 1631 one final time to settle accounts with his deity and himself. Given his fascinating life, it’s surprising that Donne hasn’t been written about more over the past decades. Rundell follows John Stubbs, whose 2006 biography The Reformed Soul explored the inherent contradictions in Donne’s religious and spiritual convictions, and John Carey, whose 1981 book John Donne: Life, Mind and Art took the writer’s sermons and letters as seriously as the poetry. Rundell’s conception of Donne as multifaceted Renaissance man is closer to Carey (whose book she praises as “the most electric piece of literary criticism I read as a teen”) than Stubbs’s more tightly focused reading, and she writes distinctively and boldly. Early on, she describes the 23-year-old Donne sitting for a portrait in the late 16th century, and notes “the painting was of a man who knew about fashion; he wore a hat big enough to sail a cat in, a big lace collar, an exquisite moustache”. Immediately, we feel closer to him. Rundell has an engagingly idiosyncratic and playful style, with chapter titles that include The Erratic Collector of His Own Talent, The Anticlimactically Married Man and The Paradoxical Quibbler, Taking Aim at Women. It suits her subject, who took delight in combining high learning with bawdy humour; only Donne could suggest, as he did in his poem The Flea, that his mistress should surrender herself to his attentions after both have been bitten by the titular insect. But there is welcome revisionism, too. Rundell debunks the traditional, self-perpetuated image of the young Donne as a lothario, observing that “women of his class would have been hard to seduce … make a mistake … and you could be punished for life”. The great chronicler of libertine passions emerges here as serially monogamous and uxorious, if hardly chaste: he had 12 children, after all. Like her subject, Rundell is keenly aware of the skull beneath the skin. She observes that “the body is, in its essentials, a very, very slow one-man horror show; a slowly decaying piece of meatish fallibility in clothes, over the sensations of which we have very little control”. Death – sudden, and often violent – stalks this book, just as it did Donne’s life. Five of his children were either stillborn or died before they were 10, and he even had a prophetic vision of one of them dying while he was away on a trip to Paris in 1612. Little wonder that Donne’s long-suffering wife, Anne, perished, exhausted, in 1617. Yet as Donne wrote in his 10th Holy Sonnet: “Death be not proud, though some have called thee/Mighty and dreadful, though are not so.” His religious faith might have been, at times, quixotic, but it was sincere and a source of comfort to him, his congregation and his readers. Throughout his life, beset as he was by illness and money worries, Donne retained an unremitting self-belief, justified by intellectual genius and personal charm. Although his work can be difficult, it speaks seductively to our anxiety-riddled times: to read his poetry is to be reassured and challenged simultaneously. He was the leading cleric of his age, one of the great English poets of love, death and sex, and the first writer to advance an intellectual argument in favour of suicide, in his posthumously published essay Biathanatos. Like Whitman, and Bob Dylan, he contains multitudes. In Rundell, Donne has an authoritative and sympathetic chronicler. If Super-infinite is ultimately stronger on the thematic and literary than the historical – Rundell’s evocations of court and international intrigue are gripping, but veer away from the book’s protagonist – then its achievements are substantial enough to make any shortcomings seem petty. This fine book demands and rewards your fullest concentration, just as its subject does: a super-infinite amount, in fact.

4/10/2022,"The very air is different. Bel Air, in fact. Danya Taymor’s phenomenal UK premiere production of Jeremy O Harris’s Daddy (2019) bounces off the stage with the flat glare of a Hockney pool painting. Indeed, there is a real, splash-making pool on stage: the front row of the stalls was wringing itself out in the interval. The white walls of the villa designed by Matt Saunders are hit with Day-Glo colour. Isabella Byrd’s lighting sharpens contours, transfixing a character in a pink glow or, as if painting with a brush, sending colour slowly down a figure from top to toe. It also makes things woozy, with ripples of watery shadows. Harris describes his play as “a melodrama” but it feels more like a trance. There is no hypercharged action; the plot shimmers. Celebrated for his 2018 drama Slave Play, Harris here examines inheritance and ownership – of people and of works of art. The central figure, performed with magnetising intelligence and pirouetting elegance by Terique Jarrett, is a young black artist who makes disconcertingly floppy sculptures that sometimes look like dolls, sometimes like lifesize versions of friends. He is taken up – and in – by an older, wealthy white man whose walls are laden with Basquiats and who tells the artist he has legs “like Naomi’s”. The young man’s prospects are advanced but his personality risks being tainted by the relationship with this sexual mentor, given sinister inscrutability by Claes Bang. He looks as if he may be, well, booty. It is an evening that cleverly mixes satire, psychology (too much of this in the closing half-hour) and sheer flourish. Crisp caricatures are exquisitely delivered: a poolside lounger – and serial hanger-on to rich blokes – squeals that she has never seen the handwriting of any man she has dated: “Anyone know how to read cursive?” More than one father is crucial: the man who abandoned the artist as an infant, as well as the sugar daddy. And let’s not forget God the Father: the artist’s mother (glorious Sharlene Whyte) is a big fan of His; she corkscrews her way around the stage, urging the affluent wastrels to have a good pray. Whyte has a gospel backing group who dip in and out of the pool in full surplices; George Michael’s Father Figure winds its way throughout the evening, evoking teachers, preachers and naked bodies. Lee Kinney’s sound design, which mingles the music with electronic hums and mobile chimes, is an essential part of the bright strangeness of the production; as if that air were vibrating. Later this month, Harris is hosting a “Black Out” performance of Daddy, in which seats will be reserved for black spectators. The aim is to give black theatregoers the experience white audiences have routinely: of being in an audience that “looks like them”. I imagine Chinonyerem Odimba might look kindly on this idea. Her musical play Black Love is a celebration of the love between a brother and sister and a conjuring up of their affection for their dead mother. Above all, and at its most effective, it is an attack on a white girl who heaves her way into the lives of both siblings, having started an affair with the boy, and assumes she can squat there. This does not always hang together. The music, by Ben and Max Ringham, is not used consistently; lines of the lyrics straggle; some of the dialogue is weighed down by therapy speak. Yet the attack – vibrantly voiced by Nicholle Cherrie as the sister, Roo, with Nathan Queeley-Dennis as her faltering brother, Orion, and Beth Elliott as the white Lois – is arresting, not least because the argument is not straightforward: Lois is not all villainness and her adversary has some interest in keeping her brother for herself. This is a salutary jolt. There is no such disturbance in Alexis Zegerman’s The Fever Syndrome though. There’s a whole lot of shaking going on. The adolescent girl (performed with assurance by Nancy Allsop) whose medical condition gives the play its title is prone to sudden temperatures – and to fits. Her grandfather has Parkinson’s, and is played by Robert Lindsay with an unstoppable tremor in one hand. Lindsay, powerful as the wounded lion, doesn’t overdo this – though I would like to see a play in which Parkinson’s was characterised by its freezing as well as its trembles. If only the audience’s expectations were as thoroughly shaken. Three generations of a family gather in a New York brownstone, coming together at the news of their father’s decline: of course they come apart. Lizzie Clachan’s design – a cross-section of rooms stacked not too neatly on top of each other – promises intricacy and incisiveness. In fact, too many expectations and promises are predictably flipped over. A son is confidently announced not to be coming: he arrives. The father, a pioneer of IVF, has made countless families happy; naturally, he has not made his own children feel loved. The money on which everyone is depending is… not completely dependable. There are a few whopping symbolic hints about childhood secrets. Two of the sibs scrape around for sweets they hid as kids. The patriarch is haunted by a teenage version of his unhappy daughter, who dances around the stage and goes a bit bonkers most often in – of course – the attic. Mostly though, and damagingly for a play about buried feelings, difficulties are explicitly laid out, discussed – and finally, implausibly, wrapped up at the end. Some needling acting – particularly from beadily focused Lisa Dillon – is not enough to give Roxana Silbert’s lethargic production savour, or make this family’s wrangles reverberate. Harris’s pool captures more echoes.

4/10/2022,"People often accuse academics of being disconnected from events in the outside world, but last week shows that’s not always the case. A Warwick and LSE team has released great new research on non-doms – UK residents who aren’t required to pay UK tax on their overseas incomes or wealth because this isn’t their permanent home. Their timing was impeccable (although I’m assured entirely coincidental), as the rights and wrongs of the chancellor’s wife, Akshata Murty, being a non-dom dominated the news. However, what makes it great isn’t the timing – it’s getting data on non-doms to inform often fact-free debates about the subject. So what did we learn? Well, it helps explain why a senior politician’s family might have taken the huge, obvious political risk of being treated favourably when compared with almost the entire population. While there aren’t many non-doms (around 70,000), when you focus on the population as a whole, you’d be forgiven for thinking otherwise if you move in certain circles: one in five top-earning bankers and two in five of those with income over £5m are/were non-doms. Recent reforms rightly made it more difficult for people to live in the UK for long periods without losing non-dom status. Some argued that this would make us less competitive, with talented/rich people flooding out or not arriving. But this study shows that, while the numbers currently claiming non-dom status have been falling, the total number of UK residents who have at some point been non-dom has continued to rise. The reforms levelled the tax playing field a little but didn’t scare people off. Because, luckily, the UK has more to offer than low taxes.

4/10/2022,"Rishi Sunak has ordered an inquiry into who leaked details of his wife’s “non-dom” tax status to the media, raising concerns it could be a criminal offence. An investigation by the Treasury and Cabinet Office is under way after details of Akshata Murty’s tax details were leaked to the Independent. Her status as non-domiciled has allowed her to legally avoid about £20m of UK taxes on dividends from the Indian IT company founded by her billionaire father on the understanding that her long-term permanent domicile is in India. Sunak initially responded to the story by saying it was a “smear”, but late on Friday Murty issued a statement saying she would in future pay UK tax on worldwide earnings. His wife and children moved out of Downing Street this weekend to their Kensington home, with Sunak expected to spend the weekends with his family. Labour has accused Sunak of hypocrisy over tax avoidance in his own family while putting up national insurance for millions of people. Sunak’s team believe someone in Downing Street is a Labour supporter who has leaked details of Murty’s tax status for political reasons. However, an ally of Sunak – not one of his aides – believes it is people around Boris Johnson who are responsible. On Sunday another cabinet minister, Sajid Javid, was also drawn into the furore as he admitted having taken advantage of non-dom status before he became an MP. He released a statement saying he was a non-dom for six years while a banker, on the grounds that his father was born in Pakistan. Javid was born in the UK, and it is not clear where, if anywhere, he paid tax on worldwide earnings. He said: “Prior to returning to the UK and entering public life, some of my financial investments were based in an offshore trust. While this was an entirely legitimate arrangement, on becoming a minister in 2012 I decided to voluntarily collapse that trust, repatriate all assets to the UK and pay 50% income tax on those assets. “This approach deliberately incurred the heaviest possible tax burden, and offset any accrued benefits from the previous trust arrangement, but I believed it was the right thing to do.” Sunak was strongly defended by Kit Malthouse, the crime minister, who said the chancellor had been a “remarkable force of good” by bringing in the furlough scheme during the pandemic. “He is a smart, clever, committed politician who came into parliament with me and I have been deeply impressed by him ever since.
