4/1/2022,"Windows and cars were not only the things coated by the recent Saharan dust cloud that made English skies glow orange: supermarkets are urging shoppers not to turn their noses up at dusty peppers and lettuces. Tesco has put up signs in its produce aisles advising customers that a small amount of dust had settled on its Spanish crops. Spain, which is a major produce supplier to the UK, bore the brunt of the storm, with iceberg and little gem lettuce, celery and peppers among the affected crops. The residue was “nothing to be concerned about”, Tesco said, adding that customers should just wash their fruit and vegetable before eating or cooking “as usual”. By continuing to buy the fresh produce, shoppers would be “supporting our growers and preventing food waste”. When the dust cloud, which was travelling about 1.2 miles (2km) above ground level, reached the UK a fortnight ago, a red or orange tinge was visible in the skies above Sussex, Kent and London. The Met Office said the unusual effect was the result of a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering from additional particles in the air. Dan Stroud, one of its meteorologists, said the dust in the atmosphere “caused the light to be more refracted, so you get the dominance of the red and orange tinges of the spectrum”. Some dust also settled here after it rained; when it evaporated motorists reported finding their cars and windscreens covered in ochre-coloured blobs.",News/Business,Don’t let dust cloud your judgment: Tesco urges shoppers to buy sandy veg,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/01/dust-cloud-tesco-shoppers-sandy-veg-sahara
4/1/2022,"Officials have begun to receive emails giving out £50 fines for attending Downing Street parties, according to sources. After the Metropolitan police said on Monday that it was issuing 20 penalty notices, emails have gone out to some of those involved, who the police “have a reasonable belief” attended gatherings during lockdown. Government sources said the Met appeared to have tackled the “low-hanging fruit first” by concentrating on parties where those involved had acknowledged their participation. The Met suggested the fines were issued as part of a “first tranche”, indicating that more could be handed out in relation to more complicated events where those involved are denying having attended illegal gatherings. One of the events where some of the people in attendance are believed to have got fines is a leaving party on 18 June, which was held for a departing No 10 aide. There is little transparency over the issuing of fines, with civil servants not obliged to tell their bosses if they have received penalty notices. The Met is also not providing a breakdown of which out of 12 events being investigated have led to fines so far. No 10 has said it will provide an update if Boris Johnson receives a fixed penalty notice. The prime minister is believed to have been present at several of the gatherings under investigation, including a birthday party and a gathering in the garden of No 10 organised by his principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. However, he has refused to accept that a fine would mean he has broken the law, and his allies suggest he would not resign if he is issued with a penalty. In contrast, Kit Malthouse, the policing minister, appeared to back the view of two cabinet colleagues in stating that the issuing of partygate fines is evidence that police believe the law has been broken. Malthouse, a Home Office minister, said it was fair to say a fixed-penalty notice (FPN) signalled police felt an unlawful act had been committed. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Malthouse said: “A fixed-penalty notice means police have a reasonable belief that you’ve broken the law – you still have a right to challenge it if you want. “Having said that, the police practice is not routinely to release the names of those who receive fixed penalties, and I don’t see why that rule should be waived for those people who may or may not be in receipt of it in Downing Street.” Malthouse, who attends cabinet, said he had not personally received a fine in relation to the Scotland Yard investigation, but he would declare it if he did.",News/Politics,First Downing Street officials receive £50 lockdown party fines,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/01/first-downing-street-officials-receive-50-lockdown-party-fines-boris-johnson
4/1/2022,"Whole modules at performing arts academies will no doubt be taught about Harry Styles, a star who has negotiated one of the most difficult transitions in music – from boyband to solo artist – with more panache than even successful forebears such as Justin Timberlake and Robbie Williams. There was a little crunch in the gears with his debut album as he got to grips with who he was, as if living up to his surname with a range of different, anti-Directional genres. But he cruised on to a golden Pacific Coast Highway of pop with 2019’s exceptional Fine Line: focused and alert, even as the hazy musical surroundings changed around him. Since then, splashy shoots for Vogue and Dazed and the launch of his beauty company Pleasing have positioned him as a post-metrosexual arbiter of contemporary manhood: muscular and tattooed but wearing women’s clothes, being fluid to soften old binaries. Some who can remember David Bowie or the New Romantics have rolled their eyes at this – and others have found his outfits just plain clunky – but it is a marker of how narrow mainstream masculinity is that his style undeniably makes him an outlier, and it thrills young fans to see this sort of thing for the first time. Crucially, his music is so well-crafted and instinctive – it now all feels done on the first answer rather than the second guess – that his dress-up feels a part with it. That sense of freedom to wear, move or sing in any way he pleases suffuses his return on the effervescent As It Was – as does his folding of traditional modes like feminine prettiness and masculine vigour into something of his own. This is an extremely high-tempo song, and an obvious point of comparison is the Weeknd’s Blinding Lights, which also ticks along at 175bpm and has the same sort of earworm instrumental motif. More generally, Styles shares the Weeknd’s sense of a pop artist at the top of their game, omnipotently surfing their own creative juices. And Styles’s climactic “hey!” is very similar to the Weeknd’s own exclamation to round out Blinding Lights’ chorus. But where Blinding Lights was an explicit homage to a certain neon-in-rain 1980s aesthetic, As It Was is a richer blend: against that 80s-style melody is the rough splash of a real cymbal. The tempo also reminded me of the Strokes’ Hard to Explain, and the song is invested with the bedroom indie-pop production of Gen Z stars like Clairo. Maybe the steady signature backbeat of the War on Drugs is another touchstone (much as it is for an equally handsome male pop star, Shawn Mendes, with his own new single this week, When You’re Gone), and it also feels lit by a Scandinavian light: the glowing softness of that region’s indie-pop artists such as Jens Lekman. It is music to skip down the street to on a spring day, clicking your heels and picking up passing cockapoos for a cuddly spin – and Styles knows it, finishing the video with some Gene Kelly-ish gymnastics. Ah, that video. Styles’ sheer, objective gorgeousness is of course a big part of his pop star appeal, and elevates his entire endeavour further; watching the video, that sense of freedom is heightened by his very loveliness, a man who seems to move through life on a different track to the rest of us. Perhaps it is a symptom of a culture that prizes beauty so highly, or maybe I just fancy Harry Styles a bit, but he is a thrill to watch. Lyrically, it is an interesting, gossipy read, an escalation of pop’s current mode of specific, personal storytelling rather than blustery metaphor (perhaps the biggest songwriting legacy of brief Styles squeeze Taylor Swift, and a style done so well by Olivia Rodrigo, Adele and the 1975 in recent years). “Harry, you’re no good alone / Why are you sitting at home on the floor? / What kind of pills are you on?” a friend tells Styles down the phone. “Leave America, two kids follow her / I don’t wanna talk about who’s doin’ it first” is surely about his girlfriend, mother of two Olivia Wilde. The central chorus line, “You know it’s not the same as it was,” suggests it’s about the breakdown of a relationship, heavily backed up by the video, which shows Styles trapped on a treadmill with his partner, then freed for some joyful jumps around the Barbican. Is his relationship foundering? Equally, “You know it’s not the same as it was” could be a statement of pragmatism – that wondrous, even frightening moment in love where you realise your life is for ever changed. The variously disconsolate and upbeat delivery also keeps you guessing as to his intentions. The cynical reading is that Styles’s cleverness is in obscuring the meaning just enough so everyone talks about it like this; the more generous one is that he writes in a way to allow anyone to see themselves in his songs. Either way, As It Was is one of his very best.",Arts/Music,Harry Styles: As It Was review – a pop star in his own sunlit lane,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/01/harry-styles-as-it-was-review-a-pop-star-in-his-own-sunlit-lane
4/1/2022,"For most people April Fools’ Day is either a bright spot in grim times, or a tedious parade of poor jokes we could all do without, with nothing in between. With a pandemic and a global focus on conflicts in Ukraine and elsewhere, judging the tone of a decent April Fools’ gag has become much harder for companies, and even more so for news organisations battling a rising tide of disinformation on social media. For the Telegraph, the big news on April Fools’ Day was a plan by the England and Wales cricket board to drop the dreary and unsuccessful England men’s cricket team defeated in the West Indies and replace them wholesale with Heather Knight’s World Cup finalists. The Mirror announced that mud from the ill-fated Marble Arch mound was to be used to rebuild Hadrian’s Wall as part of the government’s “levelling up” agenda. Wales Online, meanwhile, suggested the Second Severn Crossing was to be renamed after the Welsh footballer Gareth Bale. You may have spotted our dedicated shipping correspondent Mari Tyme reporting not entirely implausibly that Tory MPs have been lobbying Downing Street to let the royal family use a recently seized Russian superyacht as the new flagship royal yacht. ITV’s Good Morning Britain attempted to prank viewers by having the weather presenter Laura Tobin drop live on air what was being presented to her as a unique plant that had been specially bred and was to be named in her honour. Anything can happen on live television... 😳Poor @Lauratobin1 😭 pic.twitter.com/X5FgnP5cXR Elsewhere, there was exciting news for those with an interest in cryptozoology, as the Scottish Deer Centre in Fife announced it had caught a wild haggis, a mythical creature long thought to be extinct. The animal, which is definitely not some sort of guinea pig wearing a wig, had apparently been leaving telltale footprints around the glens near the Lomond Hills. The Deer Centre has built a special habitat for the delicious little fluffball. Fusion cuisine may be somewhat out of fashion these days, but British people ruining Italian food is timeless. Pasta Evangelists claimed to be adding to their delivery range a mash-up featuring the nation’s favourite Sunday meal to produce Sunday roast spaghetti. Pink Marmalade, which genuinely does make a colour-changing gin, is also making a distressing move into Italian foods, by claiming to have launched three new pizza-flavoured gins, including a pepperoni gin which promises “an unmistakably meaty taste and a burst of takeaway vibes in every pour”. The rising cost of living in the UK has driven some people not to refer to Friday as April Fools’ Day but rather Bleak Friday. The Koop+Kraft restaurant in Waterlooville, Hampshire has a plan for that. It is promising that on Friday it is giving away a free pint of petrol with every order, an offer that is possibly more appetising than a pizza-flavoured gin. On a more practical note, the restaurant chain Burger King does genuinely appear to be giving away free Whoppers, blaming a “glitch” in its app, which has issued a voucher to customers that must be used by Saturday. Also on the food front, Easter is traditionally a time when professional hand-wringers go around bemoaning that Easter eggs don’t say Easter on them any more. They will no doubt be delighted that Mash Direct has very definitely called its new product an Easter egg. They may be less enchanted to discover that it is a chocolate egg filled with mashed potato.",News/Media,April fools of 2022: Gareth Bale Bridge and the hunt for the wild haggis,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/01/april-fools-of-2022-gareth-bale-bridge-and-the-hunt-for-the-wild-haggis
4/1/2022,"My family go to a local Catholic church where, to my wild schoolboy excitement, Leeds United players regularly attend mass. Sightings of Billy Bremner, Eddie Gray, Terry Yorath – tie-knots as wide as their trouser flares – are the real religious experience for me. Some weeks, there is a bigger buzz because of someone else who is clearly, from the way worshippers watch him go down the aisle like a bride, well known. At the time, this man – whose first TV appearances on Juke Box Jury are probably watched by my parents – means nothing to me. But writing this piece, I have the feeling that my whole life is somehow heading from those Sunday mornings to a horrific encounter with Jimmy Savile 40 years later. Along with most of my generation, I watch Clunk-Click and Jim’ll Fix It, the shows with which Savile, until then mainly a music presenter (he had done Top of the Pops since 1964) morphs into a children’s TV star. He is heading towards 50. Clunk-Click launches on BBC One on 5 May 1973. It is most notable for having hijacked the title of a public information series urging drivers to use seatbelts (compulsory in new cars from 1968), which Savile fronted. These days, a BBC manager would almost certainly veto it. Lasting two series, it feels a warmup for Jim’ll Fix It, which launches on 31 May 1975 into schedules that seem both impossibly distant – The Black and White Minstrel Show, with white singers wearing Black makeup, came later in the evening – and weirdly near: at 8.50pm there was a political broadcast by the No campaign in the EU referendum, futilely at that time. “I want to swim with a dolphin … read the news … fly a plane,” runs the first BBC billing for Jim’ll Fix It. “Whatever your wildest dream is, Jimmy Savile will try to make it come true.” Having access to a studio of grateful, elated children was, we now know, beyond the wildest dream of the presenter. Although already well advanced on becoming one of history’s most prolific criminal sex offenders, Savile shows a peculiar proclivity for public near-confession. In his book God’ll Fix It, he admits to being “an abuser of things and bodies and people”, a formula that can in retrospect allude to both sexual abuse and necrophilia (“bodies” and “people” are oddly differentiated). Elsewhere in God’ll Fix It, he repeats his regular hope (also expressed in many interviews) that his good works will provide enough “on the credit side” for God Almighty to overlook the “debit side”. As he boasts that the black lines in the ledger add up to tens of millions of charitable donations, he is effectively confessing that the red entries have nearly equal value. How much bad would you need to do to require so much good? At the time, it never occurs to us his accounting is absolutely precise. Living in London, I go north to Leeds United games whenever possible. This is a time, two years before the Hillsborough disaster, when overcrowding or scary penning-in on the terraces are common. During a crowd surge at Elland Road, someone shouts: “Don’t die because you’ll get taken to hospital and be fucked by Jimmy Savile in the morgue.” (He volunteered as a hospital porter, including morgue duties, at Leeds General Infirmary from 1960.) This shows that horrendous stories about the broadcaster – not just paedophilia, but necrophilia – were in the public domain, at least in Yorkshire, for decades before his exposure. Twenty-five years later, I tell this to a retired high court judge posthumously investigating Savile. Interviewed off the record for my novel about Margaret Thatcher, a member of her retinue recalls Savile as a regular guest at Chequers, teasing and pranking the prime minister much as the Fool does King Lear. The role of court jester seems to have been Savile’s passport to the powerful. He played the part to Thatcher, the Prince of Wales (who released a statement about his “sadness” soon after Savile’s death), and to Cardinal George Basil Hume, leader of the English Catholic church from 1976 to 1999, who will successfully secure Savile a “Papal knighthood” from the Vatican in 1990 – the same year he becomes a knight of the British empire at the behest of Thatcher (overruling, it was subsequently revealed, civil service concern about his moral suitability). As a BBC presenter, I am intermittently invited to so-called “talent lunches” with one senior manager or another. At one such meal, I question why Jim’ll Fix It ended, in July 1994, after 19 years and two months, rather than let Savile depart after two full decades, a neater break point. “Yes, well,” says the BBC manager, “child protection laws are stricter now than they used to be.” A meeting of production staff to discuss possible future guests for Mark Lawson Talks To … on BBC Four. Flicking through birthdays, someone notices that Savile will be 80 in October. After swapping rumours about whether he only molests young women or dead bodies as well, we rule him out. None of those present reach higher management positions at the BBC, so this conversation does not contradict a position the BBC will take in future years: that no one at the top at any point had ever even heard rumours about Savile. Yet, if in my experience of more than 20 years, so many junior BBC staff knew the stories, it must mean that only those who didn’t were ever promoted to senior roles. What are the odds? Front Row has been offered “behind the scenes access” to the final recording of Top of the Pops, which is ending after 42 years. I go with a producer who can now only legally be identified as C23, her code in Janet Smith’s 2016 report into Jimmy Savile and the BBC. The press officer has sent her a list of potential interviews and we choose Tony Blackburn and Reggie Yates to represent both ends of the chronology. We are offered Savile, who had fronted the opening show and is co-hosting the closing one, but decline for the reason that, not being senior BBC management, we have heard all the stories. I also want to keep my colleague from an encounter with a man whose greetings to women are known to involve laboriously kissing or licking the length of their arm (both Thatcher and Princess Diana reportedly suffered this). We have happily talked to Blackburn and Yates and are packing up to go when Savile splits the double doors of the studio and lopes out, characteristically track-suited, top unzipped to show medallions nesting in chest hair. He is 79. “Now then, now then, now then,” he exclaims. “What’s all this about Radio 4?” I struggle to write the next paragraph but Smith, in her section 5: 262, records what happened with the pellucid neutrality of legal prose: He said “hello” to everyone except C23. Then he stood beside her, grabbed her round the waist with his right hand, put his legs round her left thigh (so that her leg was between his two legs) and rubbed his crotch up and down. So far as C23 can remember, he did not say anything. She felt that he was giving a performance. Fortunately Mr Lawson saw what was happening, came over and distracted Savile, then positioned himself between Savile and C23. The interview took place. There is one detail Smith omits for the proper reason that it is experienced by a witness not a victim. When I block Savile, he is furious, thwarted. His strength is extraordinary for a man four months away from 80 but I have enough height and heft to hold him off, though not without briefly feeling his erection against my leg. (Many have suggested that his favoured baggy leisure wear was doubly calculated for easy removal and to advertise his arousal to his prey without doubt.) Let me be clear that this experience is nothing at all compared to the impacts on his victims, but it is a weird memory to have and gives me some tiny insight into the suffering he inflicted. In later years, I will agonise over whether I should have stopped the interview happening. But Savile, with a tactical cunning likely developed through his depravities, created a situation in which we would appear to be reneging on an interview that had never been agreed. And at the time, though I know I have definitely seen something happen, it is impossible to be sure exactly what until discussing it on the tube back to Broadcasting House. As seems to be regrettably often the case in such situations, my colleague does not want the incident reported. She is doubtful of the BBC backing us against Savile (as, privately, am I) and asks me not to say anything. But what has happened is confirmation of 30 years of rumours, and puts me in the clear position of having not just heard something but now seen it. So when we get back, I inform my line manager and subsequently gain the impression that the information has been spread more widely. When this incident becomes public a decade later, the BBC line is that no action was taken because I failed to make a “formal” complaint. I have no recollection of ever being offered a choice of whistles to blow. My memory is that the BBC told me the matter could only be taken seriously if the complaint came from the victim. I will also later be informed that I am mistaken about the number of BBC managers among whom news of the 2006 assault was shared. The Sunday Times reports that ITV will soon screen Exposure: The Other Side of Jimmy Savile, a documentary reanimating an investigation into Savile that had been dropped by BBC Two’s Newsnight the previous December. The following day, a global email from BBC HR urges all employees to inform line managers of any known incidents relating to Savile. I remind two executives of 2006. On that autumn Monday morning, the corporation moves with a speed as determined as its earlier stasis. C23 and I are rapidly questioned (without warning) by the Metropolitan Police, to whom our names have apparently been given. We both speak to detectives and, after Smith is appointed on 11 October to investigate Jimmy Savile and the BBC, we each give evidence during the four years of her investigation. An NHS inquiry reports that Savile abused multiple patients at Stoke Mandeville Hospital (where he had his own room) and Broadmoor secure psychiatric hospital (to which a Conservative government actually gave him a set of keys). There are also rumours of – and reports of Savile boasting about – raping and abusing corpses at Leeds General Infirmary, supporting the terrace rumour at Elland Road four decades before. With time to spare before reviewing a play at Alan Ayckbourn’s Stephen Joseph theatre, I drive up to Woodlands Cemetery and work out from newspaper photos where Savile’s grave must be. His headstone – a vast granite triptych with the inscription It Was Good While It Lasted, a DJ’s last glib jingle – was pulverised at midnight two years before, its fragments used for landfill. Someone appears to have laid a single flower on the grassy knoll, unless the wind filched a tribute from an undisgraced grave. A tag with the council logo is tied on the fence behind, in line with the mound. Is that so they know where he is in case of exhumation or removal? Others seem to be following this ghoulish route; a group arrive as I leave. There is a sense of not being able to believe the scale of the fall until seeing what was an extravagant shrine (to a man called “a saint” in BBC coverage) but is now just scruffy lawn. The Exaro news website publishes a reputed draft copy of Smith’s report, detailing hundreds of assaults in the 1960s and 70s. There is no mention of 2006, or of other allegations in the latter part of the 20th century. I contact Smith’s lawyers. Apparently, the scope of the inquiry is “historical” and “focusing on the 60s and 70s”, which means that any managers involved are now lost to their pensions or eternity. (It is unclear if this remit is set by Smith or the BBC.) So an assault just a decade ago is too recent to count? No one is saying that. Further interviews are conducted. The Smith report is officially published (expanded from the Exaro draft) and now details assaults from 1964 to 2006. It is revealed that the 79-year-old Savile, on the day he assaulted my colleague, also attacked an audience member at the final Top of the Pops. While pointing out that she has no power to compel executives to give testimony under oath, Smith clears the BBC of “knowledge by the body corporate”. This allows the BBC to claim, as it quickly does, that bosses are exonerated, although it is actually a legal concept, meaning not that nobody knew of any Savile problems but that not everyone at a senior level knew everything: ie there was no organised cover-up. My bigger surprise is that every senior BBC figure interviewed claims never to have heard any rumour or gossip about Savile. It would be comprehensible if they felt there was insufficient information to take action, but not that they were completely clueless. I make contact through third parties with the manager who told me 20 or so years earlier about why Jim’ll Fix It was taken off air. Their eventual reply is that the comment referred to increasing protective measures around studio shows involving children (including vetting and chaperones), making the format prohibitively expensive. Some will see it as my duty to name – even turn in to the police – this BBC manager. However, they have never denied under oath knowing about Savile’s activities, so perjury is not an issue, and a retired detective has advised me that, as the boss’s gloss on the “child protection” comment is plausible, our exchange would become a they say/I say dispute, making further action impossible. The immediate response to the Smith report of the BBC director-general, Lord Hall of Birkenhead, is to sack Tony Blackburn from Radio 2 and BBC local radio, for alleged failure to cooperate with Smith, decisions later reversed after threats of legal action by the DJ. One other oddity. I am due on publication day to record interviews for a documentary at Broadcasting House. But the producer is contacted by a manager who suggests it would not be a “good day” for me to be around the building. When pressed on this, the manager suspends the request. There are TV crews outside, seeking comments on the Smith report. This, presumably, is the worry. Exaro is later discredited for accepting and disseminating the testimony of “Nick” (now serving an 18-year jail term under his real name of Carl Beech), who had made false accusations against multiple public figures to the post-Savile Operation Midland investigation into alleged celebrity paedophile rings. Lord Hall is subsequently severely criticised by the Dyson report for his “woeful” handling of a BBC inquiry into the means by which Martin Bashir secured a 1995 Panorama interview with Diana, Princess of Wales. In Pizza Express on the South Bank, I meet, at his request, Neil McKay, a TV dramatist I admire for works including Appropriate Adult, See No Evil: The Moors Murders and Four Lives. He is researching a four-part drama about Savile and his victims that the BBC will air later in 2022, starring Steve Coogan as the predatory presenter. There is no writer I would trust more than McKay not to ignore the BBC’s complicity in its long-time employee’s crimes. I am also interviewed by 72 Films, a British production company commissioned by Netflix to make a two-part documentary about Savile. That is a hard decision. I don’t like talking publicly on this subject because it is painful even at my secondary level of exposure, and because some people seem to get jumpy when I do. It is a melancholy fact that everyone who ever tried to expose Savile – including Meirion Jones and the late Liz MacKean, the producers who led the Newsnight investigation – soon left the BBC. So it would be much easier never to think or write about Savile again. But I feel a duty as apparently the only person alive who ever tried to report a Savile assault to the BBC in real time. And I do so because I believe his story should be examined and dramatised: I believe that how he got away with it for decades should snap at the ankles and yelp at the throats of the British establishment for ever like an angry dog. If the BBC can show a Savile story, I can, perhaps should, tell mine. Because the true story is his victims, and how the BBC, Department of Health, Conservative party, Catholic church, police forces, local councils and libel law let them down. I had glimpses of him in action; they live for ever with the consequences of a monster for whom the British establishment – political, royal, broadcasting, ecclesiastical, medical, charitable – provided a dazzling shield.

4/1/2022,"The biggest fashion must-have of this season is the tiniest skirt you have ever seen in your life. In case you have somehow missed the Miu Miu micro that has gone mega, let me describe it. Imagine you took a pair of pleat-front chino trousers and cut both legs off just above the crotch seam, so that you were left with the waistband and the few inches of fabric that end at the exact height of your knicker gusset, with the inner part of the pockets poking out below. That. The skirt is from Miu Miu’s spring collection, and, despite its diminutive size, you probably have seen it, because it has been everywhere. It was on the cover of i-D, on “plus-size” model Paloma Elsesser. It was on the cover of Vogue Korea. Lara Stone wore it in Czech Vogue; Zendaya wore it in Interview magazine. Emma Corrin wore it to a New York fashion week party. In the season of the miniskirt renaissance, this is the homecoming queen of them all. I am quite cross about this skirt. It’s not that I disapprove, mind. I’m not, to be clear, like one of those 1960s men who used to rap their umbrellas on the window of Mary Quant’s boutique in disgust, railing about the lack of morals. I have no objection to the wearing of any skirt, visible to the naked eye or not. No, my disappointment is that, when the miniskirt revival began late last year, I was kind of into it. Yes, I thought to myself, I actually am a bit bored with my floppy skirts that flap around my shins all the time. Hurrah for the miniskirt! When this trend sails into town, I will definitely be jumping on board. But then the miniskirt revival turned into a micro-mini one. And the invisi-mini doesn’t work for me at all, because – call me a big square, but I basically like quite normal-looking clothes. So the miniskirt I want is a skirt that ends somewhere in the middle of the thigh. A skirt that finishes at the midway point between knees and bottom. A macro mini, not a micro one.I realise this makes me sound about 45 million years old, but it’s not entirely an age thing. Nicole Kidman is 54 and wore this skirt on the cover of Vanity Fair. Each to their own, but to me the micro looks cold and draughty. I hope it goes without saying that I would defend to the hilt the right for any woman to wear the most minimal of skirts. But the way I see it, clothes are a way of telling the world who you are and what you’re about, and I guess I’m just not sure I want to put the very top bit of my thighs at the centre of my public identity. So a slightly longer miniskirt is where my heart is at. All the joyous energy of a mini, but with a bit less song and dance. I’m talking Monica in Friends, who had a very good line in A-line miniskirts worn with, say, a ribbed polo neck and a pair of mid-heeled knee-high boots. So good. I’m talking Alana Haim in Licorice Pizza, in the long-sleeved short dress in chocolate brown she wears for the first date, and again later in the movie. Ali MacGraw in a kilt in Love Story, never not on the moodboard. The macro-mini was on the catwalk at Max Mara for this spring, in a grown-up version that was dubbed the “boardroom mini”, and it looks great at Fendi for autumn in a sturdy check, with a petticoat frill beneath adding an extra couple of inches. The tiniest skirt of the season is the one making the biggest noise. But it is the not-so-mini that has legs.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Call me a big square but the micro-mini trend is a few inches too far for me | Jess Cartner-Morley ,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/01/micro-mini-miniskirt-trend-few-inches-too-far-for-me
4/1/2022,"One welcome hiatus during the pandemic was from the rat race of children’s birthday parties. It never reached Christina Crawford levels of pony and fairground rides in our corner of New York but, before March 2020, middle-class kids in my neighbourhood would routinely throw parties at venues that once catering, party bags and gratuities were factored in, comfortably hit a low three-figure amount in dollars per child. Then came the pandemic and the trampoline parks shut down. No more events at American Girl Doll. Thank God, an end to Saturday afternoons at the Sugar Factory. Instead, birthdays slid back to where they were meant to be, outside in a park, even in snow. As long as there was singing and cake, the children were as happy in the playground as they’d been in the foam pit of the expensive soft play area. And with lower costs a head, the parties got bigger and less exclusive. As with so many changed habits of that period, many of us said at the time, oh we’ll carry on doing it like this for ever. And, as in almost every other category, the conviction has started to slide. On Sunday, a ninth birthday party at a venue in Times Square, billed as a children’s arcade but that may more accurately be described as a casino. Each child guest is issued a swipecard giving them access to unlimited video games and a capped amount for games with prizes, which include, amusingly, actual slot machines. I love an arcade. We do the driving games and the zombie killing ones. We shoot hoops and play table hockey. My two win stuffed animals and are over the moon. Still, I find myself wincing. The spirit in which these sorts of parties are thrown is more transactional than the ones in the park, with an expected minimum spend on each gift. After it’s all over, parents tend to audit the haul and any shortfall is noted and not appreciated. You can sigh, but it’s as proscribed as Regency England; there’s no changing it. Back to business as usual. It’s how things are, always were, and ever will be. Visuals from the Cambridges’ state visit to the Caribbean are still circulating as more come in from Prince Philip’s memorial. I don’t mean this entirely unkindly, but with each passing year, Prince William, once so reminiscent of Diana, edges closer in outline not to Charles or Peter Phillips, his oblong-shaped cousin, but to his late paternal grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh. Oof. Genes will out. Coverage of the memorial extended to some mild tutting over Andrew, his mother’s favourite, re-upped to the frontline as the Queen’s escort into Westminster Abbey, but most of the opprobrium from the popular press was reserved, as usual, not for the alleged sex offender, but for the podcaster. Harry was, said the tabloids, “petulant” for not attending and you can imagine how that conversation went down in Montecito: they’re your family, you go. Faced with the prospect of sitting in a draughty hall full of sour-faced ghouls, one sympathises with Harry’s choice to stop at home. One result of all this, oddly, is a surge in affection for Prince Edward, once the absolute runt of the litter but who, relative to the others these days, appears to be almost heroically blameless. A man comes to fit the new dishwasher after many weeks of delay, and it triggers disproportionate stress on my part. I don’t know what this is. I’m not indecisive. I have a high tolerance for pressure. But home improvements undo me, in particular when there’s heavy lifting involved, plus electronics, and the potential for flooding. He’s come up from Coney Island and, three hours in, hasn’t managed to uninstall the old one. I hide in my room, pacing. There’s drilling. Then scraping. Then a terrible sound of something heavy being dragged across a floor. The only thing that soothes me, apart from popping upstairs to my neighbour who has Valium, is to talk it out – and I have been talking about it a lot, lately. In a brief lull between construction sounds, I call a friend. “Do you have a moment?” I whisper. There’s a nervous pause. I guess I’ve been overdoing it. “Is this about the dishwasher?” she says. Rebel Wilson, whose appearance two weeks ago at the Baftas seemed, quaintly, like the worst thing that could happen at an awards do, is selling her house in Sydney. (If you missed her opening act, Wilson told jokes about weight loss, JK Rowling, and Will Smith’s open marriage, which the New York Post summarised with the headline, “Just Not Funny”.) Clapping in the audience was the faint smatter you used to hear during the In Memoriam section for dead sound technicians no one had heard of. Anyway, she’s selling her house on Instagram and it’s the most likable thing she’s done for a while. She’s even had a stab at the estate agent’s pitch. The elevator, she notes, is something that goes “up and down” while showing a view of the water. The location is a “brilliant street and suburb”, while the property itself has undergone a “meticulous renovation”. She refers interested parties with at least AU$9m to spend to her estate agent who, one hopes, given her 10 million followers and degree of hustle, is giving her a deal on commission. A return of that old favourite, the PC Gone Mad panic, a rich seam in the ’90s and back, thanks to a pub in Devon rebranding ploughman’s lunch as ploughperson’s. Woke ham and cheese, then cancel culture came for the celery, everyone knows their proscribed rolls here (sorry). Landlords of the pub, the Tor, are either publicity geniuses, breathing new life into a clapped-out old genre or, more probably, have blindly stumbled into a minefield. In the best tradition of this kind of story, it turns out they rebranded the menu item two years ago and it only just come to light on social media. It was, they said sadly this week, “a lighthearted gesture and nod to our local farming community of men and women. We never intended to cause offence.” As a friend points out, the real story about ploughman’s lunch has been missed for generations, which is the out-of-whack ratio of bread to cheese. In the case of Marmite or butter, one person’s bread-to-spread quotient is another’s red flag for psychopathy. Fine. But, in this hyper-polarised times, can we all agree on this one universal: in any lunch plate where you’re left with a hunk of unmitigated cheddar, something has gone savagely wrong.",News/UK news,"Digested week: the birthday rat race is back – oh, for pandemic parties in the park",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/01/digested-week-the-birthday-rat-race-is-back-oh-for-pandemic-parties-in-the-park
4/1/2022,"Profits at a PPE company that secured support from the home secretary, Priti Patel, as it lobbied ministers for UK government contracts have soared after it won £216m in taxpayer-funded business during the pandemic. Revenues at Pharmaceuticals Direct Limited jumped from £38m to £166m in the year to the end of March 2021, with profits rising eightfold, from £1.6m to £13m, according to accounts filed this week at Companies House. The company, which also paid a £420,000 dividend for the year, won two PPE contracts during the period, worth a combined £131m. Last year, Labour accused Patel of a “flagrant breach” of the ministerial code, which she denied, after letters emerged showing that she intervened with Michael Gove on behalf of the company, which was represented by a former adviser of hers. Documents showed that in May 2020, Patel attempted to secure a PPE deal for the firm worth £20m. Her efforts failed after the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the masks were “not suitable for the NHS”, according to disclosure in a legal case brought by the Good Law Project. On documents for both contracts, Samir Jassal was named as Patel’s “suppliers’ contact” at PDL. Jassal is a former adviser to Patel, has stood as a Conservative candidate at two general elections and has met Boris Johnson and David Cameron. At the time, a spokesperson for Patel said: “The home secretary rightly followed up representations made to her about the vital supply of PPE. During a time of national crisis, failure to do so would have been a dereliction of duty.” PDL, whose owner Bemal Patel (no relation to the home secretary), has since won a third contract, worth £85m, to provide lateral flow tests, taking its total income from Covid-19 work to £216m. The Guardian has approached PDL and Jassal for comment. Disclosure from the government – in response to a pre-action letter from the Good Law Project campaign group – revealed a letter Patel wrote to Gove in May last year. The Daily Mail, which first reported on the documents, said the possible deal was worth £20m. In the letter, Patel expressed disappointment that the government no longer required supplies of KN95 masks from PDL, saying “they have committed stock and secured supply, exposing them to considerable financial risk and pressures”. “The late stage in which the government has decided not to use them has caused these problems,” the home secretary wrote on 3 May last year. She went on to say she would be “most grateful” if Hancock could review the matter urgently and urged him to “work with the company to distribute and supply these masks”. Hancock wrote back 10 days later to say that “KN95 face masks are Chinese standards” and that UK officials have concluded that they are “not suitable for use in the NHS”.",News/Business,Profits jump for Patel-backed PPE firm after it won £216m contracts,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/01/profits-jump-for-patel-backed-ppe-direct-limited-after-it-won-216m-contracts

4/1/2022,"Coronavirus infection levels have hit an all-time high in England with one in 13 thought to have had Covid in the most recent week, data from the Office for National Statistics has revealed. The latest figures also reveal that the number of coronavirus infections across the UK rose by about 650,000 compared with the week before, with 4,908,900 people estimated to have had Covid in the most recent week. According to the latest information from the ONS, based on swabs collected from randomly selected households, an estimated 7.6% of the population in England had Covid in the week ending 26 March, about 4,122,700 people. The figure is the highest recorded by the survey since it began looking at the situation in April 2020, and surpasses the previous high at the start of 2022, when 1 in 15 people in England were estimated to have had Covid. Further analysis revealed infection levels had risen across all regions of the country, but were highest in the south-west of England, where 9.4% of the population were estimated to have had Covid in the most recent week. The data also suggests that while infection levels have plateaued among children and young adults, they continued to rise among those aged 25 years and over in the week ending 26 March. About 8% of people aged 35 to 49 and 6.6% of those aged 70 and over are thought to have had Covid in the most recent week – the latter a record high for the age group. Infection levels remain high in Scotland and Northern Ireland – although the trend in the most recent week is uncertain for both – and have continued to rise in Wales. The latests ONS data suggests about one in 14 people in Wales and one in 12 people in Scotland had Covid in the most recent week. For Northern Ireland, the figure was one in 15. Kara Steel, a senior statistician for the Covid-19 Infection Survey, said that rapid rise in infection levels was fuelled by the growth of the Omicron variant BA.2 across the UK. “Infection levels remain high, with the highest levels recorded in our survey seen in England and Wales and notable increases among older age groups,” she said.",News/World news,"Covid infections at all-time high in England, ONS data reveals",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/covid-infections-at-all-time-high-in-england-ons-data-reveals
4/1/2022,"Rock meet bottom, in form terms at least. While Norwich are dead last in the Premier League with six successive defeats, Brighton match their torrid run with six losses of their own. Thankfully for Graham Potter his side sit atop a comfortable 11-point cushion above danger while Norwich are an alarming six points from the last safe spot. Dean Smith and Potter will certainly hope the international break will have lifted any broken spirits but Brighton’s streak feels easier to break loose from considering their gulf in class. Norwich’s desperation may also play into their favour. It is now or never for them and any mistakes will serve an instant reminder of their precarious position. Smith will be desperately hoping for an early goal to calm the frayed nerves.

4/1/2022,"The Duke of York and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, have been named in a ruling on a high court case featuring a dispute between a Turkish woman and businessman. Nebahat Isbilen, 77, was allegedly tricked by Selman Turk into giving Prince Andrew £750,000 “by way of payment for assistance” with her passport, court documents reportedly show. The documents reveal the prince has since repaid the cash after Isbilen alleged it was a scam. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by the prince or Ferguson. A spokesperson for Andrew said: “We are unable to comment on ongoing legal proceedings.” The revelations come after the prince settled a sexual assault case filed against him by Virginia Giuffre for an undisclosed sum, reported to be as much as £12m. The out-of-court settlement in the US civil case means the prince makes no admission of guilt over claims by Giuffre that he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17, allegations he has repeatedly denied. A court ruling available online details the case between Isbilen and the businessman Selman Turk but is not a final ruling in the case, which is ongoing. Turk disputes Isbilen’s allegations. Isbilen had needed assistance moving her assets out of Turkey after her husband was imprisoned there owing to his “political affiliations”, the court had been told. Turk, a former banker, had agreed to help Isbilen move her assets out of reach of the Turkish authorities. Isbilen has alleged that Turk “breached fiduciary obligations he owed to her” and “advances claims in deceit”. Turk is fighting the case. In the ruling, Judge Halpern QC said a lawyer representing Isbilen had told him, in an affidavit, that information had emerged to show evidence given by Turk was “misleading”. He said the solicitor Jonathan Tickner had told him how evidence showed that “money was used for purposes unconnected with Mrs Isbilen, eg substantial sums were paid to Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and to Sarah, Duchess of York”. A “particulars of claim” document seen by the Guardian and first reported in the Daily Mail states: “In or around November 2019, Mr Turk told Mrs Isbilen that she needed to make a purported ‘gift’ of £750,000 to HRH Duke of York by way of payment for assistance that he told her HRH Duke of York had provided in relation to Mrs Isbilen’s Turkish passport.” The document states that the passport suggestion was a ruse. The document continues: “The representation that Mrs Isbilen needed to make a gift to HRH Duke of York in connection with her passport (or for any other purpose) was false, and Mr Turk made it dishonestly, knowing it to be false and intending Mrs Isbilen to rely on it.’ Isbilen is said to have authorised the transfer of £750,000 on 15 November 2019. The court document, dated in January this year, continues: “Mrs Isbilen has now received £750,000 from HRH Duke of York.” Another court document, dated April 2021, states Turk disputes Isbilen’s allegations: “He disagrees with her portrayal of the facts, including as to her understanding of the various dealings with her assets. He states that much of what has happened is the result of Mrs Isbilen’s status as a politically exposed person and the consequential difficulty in dealing with her assets.”",News/UK news,"Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson named in legal case over £750,000 ‘scam’ ",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/01/prince-andrew-and-sarah-ferguson-named-in-legal-case-over-750000-scam
4/1/2022,"Choreographer William Forsythe has nothing to prove. Having spent decades reinventing ballet and pushing dance’s limits, he has seemingly reached a point where he just wants to have fun, and generously wants you to have fun, too. This double bill for English National Ballet unashamedly revels in ballet’s precision poses, formal exercises and bravura moves, and the utter delight of a corps of bodies moving in unison. All driven by pop music and joy. While Forsythe’s early works were set to clanging experimental electronics, his playlist has mellowed to house, R&B, soul and electro (ABRA, Khalid, Lion Babe …). Blake Works I (originally made for Paris Opera Ballet), is backed by the beat-driven melancholia of James Blake’s album The Colour in Anything. Then comes Playlist, expanded from a version made for ENB’s men in 2018, now with added tracks (including Latin disco from Barry White), and added women, too. Both pieces are along similar lines movement-wise: academicism and athleticism, classical lines expanded, bodies stylishly torqued, steps packed in at speed – although the loveliest section in Blake Works is a pas de deux for Emily Suzuki and Isaac Hernández where the drum pattern drops away and there’s breathing space for the dancers to express simplicity and complexity in love. The only downer of the evening is that the material for the women is weaker than that for the men. Flexed hands, perky pointe work, showgirl bevel – it’s all a bit cheerleader-y. Whereas it’s easier for the men (minus pointe shoes, perhaps) to cross the divide between classical poise and feeling the funk, virtuosity in flight and grounded groove. Miguel Angel Maidana catches the eye, and Giorgio Garrett, Jeffrey Cirio. Actually, all the men are impressive and their pleasure on stage is palpable and infectious. If you can watch the company tightly jumping en masse to the “Hugging and squeezing and kissing and pleasing …” bit of Natalie Cole’s This Will Be (An Everlasting Love) without beaming ear to ear, well, you are made of stone. It’s not quite perfection, but you won’t get a more feelgood night at the ballet than this.
