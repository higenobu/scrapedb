2/17/2022,"The City watchdog has raised concerns about a deal to give the cryptocurrency platform Binance access to the UK payments network just months after it ordered the company to stop all regulated activities in Britain. The Financial Conduct Authority said it had limited powers to object to the arrangement with Paysafe, a London-based payments provider, despite its concerns about Binance offering complex and high-risk investments to consumers.  The FCA had ordered Binance to stop all UK regulated activitylast June over worries about weak consumer protections, amid a wider crackdown on the cryptocurrency industry’s potential role in fraud and money laundering. Some of the UK’s largest high street banks, including Santander and Barclays, also took action, barring customers from sending money to the exchange. However, the deal opens the potential for Binance users to deposit sterling via Paysafe through the Faster Payments Service, the network for sending money between bank accounts operated by Pay.UK, which owns the system. A FCA spokesperson said: “Our concerns about Binance remain. We received a notification of this business partnership but have limited powers to object to arrangements of this kind.” The spokesperson added that Paysafe was “aware of our concerns” about Binance, and said the payments provider was “subject to close ongoing supervision consistent with our approach for firms of its size”. Paysafe said it was a reputable payments partner with deep regulatory knowledge and experience. “We take our regulatory obligations extremely seriously and comply with the highest industry standards,” a spokesperson said. “We always adopt a fully transparent approach when dealing with regulators.” Binance issued notices to UK customers in December asking them to provide additional information in order to continue to access high-risk derivatives on the platform. Paysafe will maintain full control of anti-money laundering and compliance checks based on the information it receives about customers via the exchange. The FCA consumer warning was among the first in a series of global setbacks for Binance, which is one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Regulators in Japan and Hong Kong also ordered restrictions on trade in their financial systems. Binance has no fixed headquarters, instead relying on a network of affiliated organisations that link with financial groups in different countries. Its affiliate in Britain, Binance Markets Ltd, was accused by the FCA of failing to respond to questions about the group in August 2021, making it near impossible to manage. The regulator also issued a consumer warning against Binance Holdings Ltd, which is registered in the Cayman Islands. Binance said it took its compliance obligations “very seriously” and that the firm worked collaboratively with regulators. A spokesperson added: “We have worked hard to build a robust compliance program that incorporates anti-money laundering principles and tools used by top financial institutions.”",News/Technology,Binance access to UK payments network worries City watchdog,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/16/binance-access-to-uk-payments-network-worries-city-watchdog-fca-playsafe-cryptocurrency
2/17/2022,"Sarina Wiegman readily acknowledges she is stepping into the unknown and does not know quite what to expect. As a first-time visitor to Middlesbrough on Thursday night England’s coach will be confronted by not only Tememos, the giant, futuristic, Anish Kapoor sculpture situated outside the Riverside Stadium but the town’s famous Transporter Bridge spanning the River Tees.  Yet intrigued as Wiegman may be by her temporary Teesside habitat, events on the pitch could leave the most significant impression. Although the former Netherlands coach has been in charge of the Lionesses for six games, they all involved significantly weaker opposition, resulting in six victories, with 53 goals scored and none conceded. Impressive as November’s 20-0 win against Latvia undeniably was, England face the first proper litmus test of Wiegman’s tenure against Canada’s Olympic gold medalists on Thursday night in the first fixture of the inaugural Arnold Clark Cup. Played across six days in a round-robin format as England limber up to host the European Championship this July, it also involves fixtures against two more of the world’s top 10 teams in Spain and Germany. “Since I’ve come in we’ve played games where we were in possession all the time,” said Wiegman, speaking from England’s training base at Rockliffe Park, near Darlington. “Although we did really well, the pressure wasn’t as high as we expect from these upcoming games. After these opponents I’ll know better where we are as a team. “In order to become better we need to be know where we are at this point; it will be good preparation for the Euros. We really need these games against a higher level of opposition.” As Storm Dudley began battering the north-east, Wiegman was busy devising tactical plans to combat not merely Canada but Spain at Carrow Road on Sunday and Germany at Molineux on Wednesday. “We need to work on our out-of-possession game and our in-transition game so, after this tournament, I can maybe tell you a bit more about how well we’re developing our new style of play,” said Wiegman, who led the Netherlands to Euro 2017 glory and the final of the 2019 World Cup. “Afterwards we can evaluate and decide what we need to do better to go to the next stage. We can see what we need to change. “We want to see how our players relate to each other in different situations and we want to try some things out too. The next week will be a combination of trying things out, developing our style of play and managing the workload of some players who have heavy schedules with their clubs. “We want to be tested in every area of the team: in defence, in possession and in transition moments.” Although Wiegman is delighted to be able to work with Lucy Bronze, arguably the world’s finest right-back, for the first time since the Manchester City defender’s recovery from the fifth knee operation of her career, England’s captain, Steph Houghton, continues to be sidelined by injury. Houghton’s absence dictates that Leah Williamson once again captains the Lionesses. Like Wiegman, the Arsenal defender believes the coming week will be largely about self-discovery. “We have an opportunity to learn more about ourselves this week, which is a gift really,” said Williamson. “But we’re going into this tournament to win it. It’s perfect preparation for the summer.” After a run of semi-final defeats in major tournaments, England know there is room for improvement. “We know we’ve underachieved a little bit as a team in the last few tournaments and I think everybody wants to turn that round,” said Williamson. “The dynamic of our team has changed a little bit; there’s more of a collective push to reach the next standard. The training now is some of the most competitive I’ve been involved in with.” A Canada side managed by the Consett-born Bev Priestman – England’s popular assistant manager as they reached the last four of France 2019 during Phil Neville’s time in charge – are unlikely to be broken down easily. “I would call Canada a real team,” said an admiring Wiegman. “They’ve got real structure in and out of possession – and real quality.”",Sport/Football,Wiegman excited to see England’s true standing in push for Euros glory,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/16/sarina-wiegman-england-women-true-standing-euros-canada-spain-germany
2/17/2022,"Public confidence in the Metropolitan police has fallen sharply in the five years Cressida Dick has been leading Britain’s biggest force, figures published on Wednesday show. Only 51% of those in London said they believed the Met did a good job in their local area, down 17 points compared with the last survey before Dick became Met commissioner in April 2017.  In the majority of London’s 32 boroughs, 50% or less said they believed the force did a good job. In March 2017, not a single borough was below 50%. Figures for police reliability, fairness and listening to people’s concerns are all down by 10% or more in the past five years. The polling is done on behalf of the mayor’s office for policing and crime and was introduced when Boris Johnson was London mayor as a way of holding the Met to account. Falling public confidence was cited by the current London mayor, Sadiq Khan, in his showdown with Dick that led to her resignation last week. Conservatives blamed Khan, who is also the police and crime commissioner for London, for the “shocking plummet in public confidence”. The new figures follow polling in December 2021. Comparing them with the figures in March 2017, the month before Dick became commissioner, shows the shift in public confidence. The poll asked whether police could be relied on to be there when needed. In March 2017, 79% said yes, but by December 2021 that figure had fallen by 20 points, with 59% agreeing. Compared with five years ago, 15% fewer people believe police treat everyone fairly, down to 64% from 79%. In March 2017, 76% of respondents thought police listened to local people’s concerns, but that had fallen by 14% in the latest figures. Some former senior Met insiders see the survey questions as a key test of the Met’s legitimacy. In the March 2017 survey, 68% agreed their local policing was good, with every London borough above 50%, the lowest being Enfield in north London at 58%. In the latest survey, 51% said they believed local police did a good job in their area, with the majority of London boroughs at 50% or below. Croydon in south London came out worst, at 43%, and Richmond upon Thames the best, at 70%. Victor Olisa, a former head of diversity at Scotland Yard, said: “It shows a clear diminishing of confidence across a whole range of measures, and fall in trust that the Met can keep people safe and solve crimes. The Met has not delivered what the people of London want or explained to them why they can’t have it.” Olisa warned: “The people who receive the service are not convinced of the legitimacy of the Met.” The British model is policing by consent. The crucial building blocks of that are the trust and confidence of the public. In the latest survey, only 27% of people said they knew how to contact their local ward officers, supposed to be the cornerstone of neighbourhood policing, down from 36% in March 2017. Last Thursday, hours before her resignation, Dick said on BBC London: “We have a service now, which is I’m absolutely certain, more professional, fairer, more transparent, more accountable, and closer to its communities.” Olisa said big changes to local policing and how the Met is organised appeared to have left officers more distant from communities. While the survey does not offer reasons for the fall in confidence, there have been a series of scandals during Dick’s term and claims the Met leadership mishandled them, such as the murder by a serving officer of Sarah Everard. There has also been controversy over big increases in stop and search, and claims it disproportionately affects innocent black people, as well as renewed anxiety over violent crime, especially stabbings. The Conservatives in London blamed Khan, in office since May 2016. Their police spokesperson, Susan Hall, said: “He has overseen this shocking plummet in public confidence in the Met police. Sadiq Khan himself has said that without trust and confidence in the police, the force cannot function. “Restoring trust and confidence is going to take some serious work and I hope the next Met commissioner comes armed with some serious solutions. I’m not confident that the mayor has any.” A spokesperson for the mayor of London said: “A series of events have shattered public trust and confidence in our police. When this trust is eroded, our model of policing, and therefore public safety, is put at risk. “Sadiq is clear about the scale of change required in order to regain the trust and confidence of Londoners.”",News/UK news,"Public confidence in Met fell during Cressida Dick’s term, polls show",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/16/half-of-londoners-unhappy-with-met-at-end-of-cressida-dicks-term-polls-show
2/17/2022,"Rupert Murdoch’s publishing arm is considering making a move into the frothy market of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, by turning the Times and the Sun’s extensive archive of photos, cartoons and classic front pages into unique digital versions. News UK is in the early stages of evaluating whether the crown jewels among its tens of thousands of physical images, such as exclusive pictures of the Queen, to front pages such as “It’s The Sun Wot Won it!”, to Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster, could be given a lucrative second life as exclusive digital collectibles the public could buy and trade.  Its interest comes as the market for the controversial trading of NFTs, which is viewed by sceptics as a speculative bubble akin to the cryptocurrency craze, grew to an estimated $22bn (£16bn) last year. The possible entry into the world of NFTs, a market that has been questioned by News UK’s own titles, is understood to be driven from the top, with the chief executive, Rebekah Brooks, and the chief operating officer, David Dinsmore, said to be involved. The Times unwittingly played an important role in the rise of crypto-assets. Satoshi Nakamoto, the presumed pseudonym for the person or persons who created bitcoin, embedded and quoted the 3 January 2009 front page, which led with “Chancellor on Brink of Second Bailout of Banks”, in the first ever bitcoin block chain transaction in what is now known as the Genesis Block. The move, a nod to Nakamoto’s hope that cryptocurrencies may change the global financial system for the better, led to the edition being referred to as “the most rare, and most valuable crypto-collectible in existence” – in the newspaper industry, at least. One of the areas News UK is understood to be looking at is how to leverage the crypto-fame and financial potential of the 3 January 2009 edition of the Times. However, the question of value is a thorny one. While an owner of an NFT has a digital “token” proving they own the “original” work – which could result in multimillion pound auctions at Sotheby’s and Christie’s – it may be difficult to recreate a unique element to a picture or front page that people would want to pay for when the image is readily available on the internet. News UK, which declined to comment on its crypto project, is understood to also want to keep the rights to continue to use the originals in its publications, a common phenomenon among creators of NFTs. Last month, Julian Lennon sold several items of Beatles memorabilia as NFTs, including items of clothing worn by his father, John, as well as Paul McCartney’s handwritten notes for the song Hey Jude, but kept the physical items. The financial attraction is clear: creations such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club’s 10,000 NFTs, which now trade for almost $300,000 and have been sold to celebrities including Eminem, Snoop Dogg, Paris Hilton and Jimmy Fallon, have brought in more than $1bn in sales since launching last April. But like cryptocurrencies, the NDT market is attracting increasing scrutiny from regulators because of concerns it is a bubble that could cost inexperienced investors their savings. In December, the UK advertising watchdog banned a promotion of digital “fan tokens” by Arsenal football club, saying it was exploiting supporters’ “inexperience or credulity, trivialising investment in crypto-assets, misleading consumers over the risk of investment and not making it clear the ‘token’ was a crypto-asset”. This week, HM Revenue and Customs announced it had seized three NFTs as part of an investigation into a suspected VAT fraud scheme involving 250 fake companies. Warnings about crypto-assets, which are unregulated in the UK, have come from institutions including the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority, which last month was given powers by the Treasury to ensure cryptocurrency ads adhered to the same rules as other financial marketing. There have also been calls for Transport for London, which runs the UK capital’s bus, underground and train network, to ban the rapidly proliferating cryptocurrency ads that often attempt to lure naive investors with the promise of big returns.",News/Media,News UK explores cashing in on crypto boom with NFTs,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/16/news-uk-explores-cashing-in-crypto-boom-nfts-sun-front-pages-photos
2/17/2022,"Sadie Barnette’s work honours her father’s time in the Black Panther party, a political organisation founded in the tumultuous 1960s that tried to combine socialism, Black nationalism and armed defence against police brutality.  In particular, she takes as raw material a 500-page surveillance file on Rodney Barnette, compiled by J Edgar Hoover’s FBI, which described the Black Panthers as the “most dangerous and violence prone of all extremist groups” in America. The latest in the series, a diptych using powdered graphite and coloured pencil on paper, is on display in This Tender, Fragile Thing, a group exhibition at the Jack Shainman Gallery in upstate New York that offers a fresh look at the Black Panthers in the era of Black Lives Matter. “I think of my father very much as a kind of collaborator and co-conspirator of this project,” says Sadie, whose parents filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the FBI file in 2011. “Eventually we received this document and were totally blown away by how invasive and intrusive and terrifying and extensive it was.” Now 77, Rodney grew up Medford, Massachusetts, one of 11 siblings, another of whom worked closely with Malcolm X in Boston. In 1966 he was drafted into the army and sent to Vietnam, where he was wounded and earned a Purple Heart. He returned to the US and went to Compton, Los Angeles, to bury his nephew, who had been killed in the war. Sadie recalls via Zoom: “He says he felt like he was still at war because of the police presence in the Black neighbourhoods in Compton and the military-style raids that they were doing.” Rodney felt that he had to act and saw the Black Panthers as a positive option in the community. Sadie continues: “I’m always fascinated that what we see after almost every war in the history of our country is that a generation of Black and brown men (at that time, mostly men) come home from a war and haven’t earned any more rights or status or dignity in this country than before, and so you’ll often see this upsurge of political activism or organising.” Rodney opened the Black Panther chapter in Compton before moving to the San Francisco Bay Area and joining activist efforts to defend leading activist Angela Davis, whom he lived with during her trial on murder, kidnapping and conspiracy charges. “He says one of his most important tasks was getting her to court on time every day.” She was acquitted 50 years ago this June. When Rodney finally obtained his FBI file, after haggling that took nearly five years, it was startling in its breadth and depth. There were his family members with their birthdates and other details, interviews with his old school teachers and a list of Black Panthers with “deceased” ominously written in parentheses after each name. The file showed that the Black Panther chapter in Compton had been infiltrated by informants and agent provocateurs, hastening Rodney’s departure. It also made clear that the FBI had been responsible for getting him fired from his job at the post office for the supposedly unbecoming conduct of cohabiting with a woman to whom was not married. Sadie, 37, says: “It was infuriating and chilling and we both felt he was very lucky to be alive. There are so many people who are still incarcerated as political prisoners, even as it’s become somewhat fashionable to celebrate these moments. But people are still incarcerated. Families still haven’t received any type of reparation or compensation for lost loved ones. So my father felt lucky that he lived to tell and I felt lucky that I was born.” The artist adds: “I felt a strong desire to use this material to do something other than it was intended to do, to make it live in my world and tell my father’s story, not in a sense that this is going to completely repair or fix something but just as a meditation on thinking about these issues. And of course connecting surveillance of the 60s in [the FBI programme] Cointelpro and surveillance now which, with all of the digital capabilities, is just even beyond.” At first Rodney was surprised by the idea of turning his FBI file, a product of leaden bureaucracy with only one picture (his mug shot), into art. But when on one occasion someone asked him how it felt to see the pages blown up and displayed all over the walls; he replied that it made him feel free. Sadie, who has been living with her father, mother and partner in Oakland, California, during the coronavirus pandemic, says: “If I can make my father feel free in this country, even for one moment, that really felt like a sort of mission accomplished as far as the possibilities of what art can do, even in a very particular context of the audience of one. For him to feel that way is really all I could ask for.” Say Black Panthers to one generation and they might recall militants barking at Tom Hanks in the 1994 film Forrest Gump (he gets into a punch-up and says, “Sorry I had a fight in the middle of your Black Panther Party”). There have been more nuanced portrayals in movies such as Lee Daniels’ The Butler and Judas and the Black Messiah. Today fans of the Marvel superhero franchise might think instead of Black Panther starring the late Chadwick Boseman. But the party’s revolutionary legacy is complicated and elusive. Its members epitomised radical chic when patrolling the streets with berets, sunglasses, black leather jackets, rollneck jumpers and guns. Its support network offered clothes, self-defence classes, ambulance services and protections from eviction. Its free breakfast programme for children was described by Hoover as “potentially the greatest threat to efforts by authorities to neutralize the BPP and destroy what it stands for”. The corruption of the party’s leadership, however, was noted in a New York Times article in 2016 that said: “Historians have detailed its mistreatment of female members, extortion, drug dealing, embezzlement and murder. At least 19 Panthers were killed in shootouts with one another, the authorities or other black revolutionaries.” The way cultural perspectives shift over time is evident in This Tender, Fragile Thing, on view through 30 April, combining period materials relating to the Black Panthers with works by contemporary artists in a 30,000 square foot former high school in Kinderhook, New York. The show includes photographs by Gordon Parks and John Simmons in the civil rights era, as well as by Devin Allen in Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray in 2015, and by Ada Trillo at protests in Philadelphia that followed George Floyd’s murder in 2020. Theaster Gates’s immense sculpture Walking Prayer is a vintage cast-steel Carnegie library shelving unit housing more than 2,000 books on the Black experience. Gates rebound each book in black, with single words or phrases embossed in gold, culled from its contents in lieu of titles. Gallery owner Jack Shainman says via Zoom: “The last couple of years, sitting working from home in the pandemic while everybody is watching every night another unarmed Black man gets killed by police, was mind-boggling and so it seemed a time to do this show and re-examine. There’s no answers. It just shows the struggle, the battle, and it really starts with slavery and all those injustices.” Why the title This Tender, Fragile Thing? Shainman explains: “We never learned about the Black Panther movement in school; we learned such a weird version of the history of this country. But the point of the matter is these very brave, very courageous people stepped up to the plate and had to do something; it wasn’t like a choice. “The Black Panther movement always got demonised by white people but it was an amazing thing where they were educating, teaching, feeding people, et cetera. So using that title was about it being such a fragile thing because it takes all those people believing and trying to do something to change it.” Jaci Auletto, associate director of the gallery, believes the Panthers have lessons for today, especially those made uncomfortable by Black Lives Matter’s direct action. “I feel like the urgency when you’re looking at the Panthers is so apparent and I don’t know if it’s because they did have this more aggressive way of dealing with things where they weren’t really trying to sugarcoat things for everyone. “It was a more matter-of-fact way of dealing with what their community and minority communities were dealing with and I think maybe that speaks to where we are today. There are so many things facing us that need urgency and we try and make it nice so that everyone wants to face it, and it doesn’t necessarily always lead to as much action.” Towards the end of the exhibition, Arthur Jafa’s film Love is the Message, The Message is Death brings together original and appropriated footage that juxtaposes police brutality with representations of Black pride and beauty. This and others works on display leave Shainman feeling pessimistic about the future. But Auletto says the show makes her hopeful. “Yes, there is this history and these disturbing images and depictions of violence but at the same time it’s all intermixed with these beautiful songs and moments of joy. The fact that people are starting to have a conversation and pay attention and want to learn more and see the complexities of it – that’s encouraging.” This Tender Fragile Thing runs until 30 April at Jack Shainman Gallery, Kinderhook, New York",Arts/Art and design,‘Brave people stepped up to the plate’: remembering the Black Panthers through art,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/16/black-panthers-art-exhibition-this-tender-fragile-thing
2/17/2022,"Two of the UK’s leading mayors are calling for urgent action to prepare for mass migration to cities due to the climate emergency, as a major report into the issue launches at the UN headquarters in New York on Wednesday. Mass migration to some of the world’s cities due to the climate emergency is already under way and the World Bank has estimated that unless significant action is taken, 216 million people could be on the move by 2050. In 2020, 30 million people were displaced due to the climate crisis, and 70% of people internally displaced due to the climate crisis are living in urban areas. The World Bank predicts that more than 1 billion people are at risk of being driven from their homes for climate-related reasons.  The report, launched during UN Migration Week, uses several countries in Latin America as case studies for what is happening to cities as a result of the climate emergency, and makes recommendations to ameliorate the gloomy projections about the impact of climate emergency-linked migration across the world. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and the Bristol mayor, Marvin Rees, are key players in efforts to tackle climate emergency-related migration to their own and other cities due to climate change. Khan is chair of C40 Cities, a global network of almost 100 world leading cities dedicated to combating the climate crisis and the devastating human cost of forced and unmanaged migration to cities caused by the climate crisis. Rees is one of nine mayors around the world in the Global Mayors’ Taskforce on Migration The taskforce includes mayors from Lima to Los Angeles, and from Barcelona to Bristol. The report, which will be launched at the UN headquarters with president of the general assembly, Abdulla Shahid, and secretary general, António Guterres, has been produced by researchers at Columbia and New York City universities and has been commissioned by the Mayors Migration Council, working with the UN. Khan told the Guardian: “Cities are leading the way in tackling the climate emergency. As chair of C40, one of my priorities is taking urgent action to address the causes and devastating human cost of forced migration created by the climate emergency. “By tackling the climate crisis we can avoid the worst impacts of climate change while creating new growth and jobs opportunities in our cities. In London I am working towards doubling the size of London’s green economy by 2030. All over the world, people are already being forced to move due to the climate crisis. Mayors are taking urgent action to address these issues, but we cannot do it alone. Cities need more funding and powers from national governments to urgently address the climate emergency at a local level.” Rees added: “Cities hold the key to tackling climate change, with over half the world’s population living in densely populated urban areas. This percentage will grow as cities will also house the majority of those forced to migrate because of climate change in their home countries. It’s therefore imperative that Bristol, alongside other cities in developed nations, show leadership in how to minimise the long-term need for climate displacement. At the same time we recognise that migrants are an asset to our cities and can aid our inclusive green transition by bringing diverse skills and experience.” He called for city mayors to push for the investment needed to futureproof services and infrastructure so that cities can be prepared for climate emergency-related migration in future years. The report, Climate Migration in Mexican and Central American Cities, makes global recommendations for new projects in cities to tackle the climate emergency, which include migrants as part of the solution to greening economies and making them more sustainable. It also calls for city governments to become more involved in shaping policy on climate migration. Early planning and local investment in cities could change the new migration from a crisis into an opportunity, says the report. “Our hope is that this work highlights the clear and immediate urgency for driving national and international investment to city governments and local communities as first responders to climate migration,” it adds.",News/Environment,"Prepare for mass migration to cities in climate crisis, UK mayors warn",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/16/prepare-for-mass-migration-to-cities-in-climate-crisis-uk-mayors-warn
2/17/2022,"My friend Francisco Perez Navarro, who has died aged 96, was a writer and teacher who loved lively conversation, especially when he could share his passion for art and culture over a glass of beer or wine. He wrote the first introduction to Samuel Beckett’s novels and plays for a Spanish audience, and translated the Irish writer’s challenging narrative How It Is into Castilian.Francisco was born in Madrid, to Saturnino Pérez González, a doctor, and Dolores Navarro de la Torre, who ran a dry cleaning shop. When Spain’s civil war broke out, he was sent, aged 11, to stay with his grandparents in Valsain, near Segovia. Unfortunately the area quickly became the scene of fierce fighting, and it would remain a frontline until the end of the war. Foreshadowing his future career, Francisco became a teacher to younger children in the village. In quieter spells he would also earn a few pesetas by writing letters for illiterate soldiers.  After the war he attended the Instituto de Cervantes school in Madrid, and then studied philosophy and literature at Complutense University of Madrid, graduating in 1949. In common with many of his young compatriots, he felt stifled in Franco’s Spain. In 1949 he met a British woman, Jean Atkinson; they married in 1950 and moved to Newcastle upon Tyne, where Francisco picked up work as a teacher of Spanish in various private schools. After the couple divorced, he taught for eight years from 1955 at St James’s school in Malvern, Worcestershire, and then at Clarendon college, Nottingham, from 1963 until his retirement in 1990. Meanwhile, in 1976, he published Galeria de Moribundos, introducing the work of Samuel Beckett to Spanish readers. His translation of How It Is in Castilian was published in 1978.Travel was life-enhancing for Francisco. Together with his long-time partner, Françoise (nee Gaeur), whom he married in 1987, as soon as the school holidays began he would leave his book-filled home in Nottingham for Europe’s galleries and cultural festivals. For many years he was London correspondent of the Spanish art magazine Indice, for which, under the nom de plume John Hathaway, he wrote about art exhibitions in London and articles under the heading Crónicas de Inglaterra (Chronicles from England).Despite living in England for more than 70 years, Francisco spoke English with a heavy accent. With his trademark beret and beard he was unmistakably Spanish but regarded himself as a citizen of the world. Francisco remained in Nottingham after retirement, visiting galleries, theatres and cinemas and eating out in restaurants and pubs, where he would always be chatting to people he had just met. He had many friends in Paris and Madrid, and regularly stayed in Tübingen in Germany, where he was researching the writer Friedrich Hölderlin. Françoise died in 2002. Francisco is survived by their son, Pedro, and by Rafael, Maria, Gabriel and Miguel, the children from his first marriage.

2/17/2022,"Ifirst visited and photographed Sarajevo in 1996. I had been volunteering in neighbouring Croatia and managed to hitch a ride in to Bosnia in a UN vehicle. The war and siege had ended a few months before and the city was enjoying its long-awaited peace. Sarajevans took to its scarred streets in huge numbers, meeting with friends and drinking coffee safe in the knowledge that they wouldn’t be struck down by a sniper or shell. The destruction of the city at that time was jaw-dropping, surreal and seemingly total: rows upon rows of broken, bombed-out high-rise flats; shell craters and explosion indents everywhere; hospitals, offices and factories all in ruins. This was urbicide, a late-20th-century Dresden or Stalingrad. Everyone who lived through the nearly four-year siege had a nightmare to share.  I returned to the city the following year and set up a photo project for children: the Sarajevo Camera Kids. Using donated equipment from back home in Scotland, I set up a makeshift darkroom and organised photo classes in the basement of an orphanage. I developed a somewhat unhealthy obsession with Sarajevo and all things Bosnian, and volunteered with the kids’ photo project for three consecutive summers.The Sarajevo Camera Kids led to lifelong friendships and connections with the students and with the city of Sarajevo. I would return there and to the wider Balkans over the next few years to document the peace and the reconstruction – which eventually culminated in my book and exhibition A Balkan Journey. This photograph was taken in Sarajevo on 21 November 2015, 20 years to the day after the Dayton peace agreement was signed, signalling the end of nearly four years of brutal wars in Bosnia and Croatia and bringing about the end of the siege of Sarajevo – the longest city siege in modern history. Sarajevo had changed dramatically since 1996, when I took photographs of a city in black and white, destroyed but surviving. The city now put on a brave, bold, cosmopolitan face; a modern European tourist destination like any other. An abundance of new shopping centres ran the length of the former Sniper Alley – the main thoroughfare leading into the heart of the city – and the Sarajevo that the Camera Kids documented no longer existed. But the divisions were still endemic. For the 20th anniversary of peace, I wanted to document the stories of young people in their late teens and early 20s, who were born during or just after the conflict and so had no real memory of the war. I wanted to find out what, if anything, the Dayton agreement and peace in Bosnia had meant to them at a time when memories of the war were still raw and the ethnonationalist leaders were still in power and driving the divisions. The sad reality is that young people in Bosnia still have separate education systems that work to replicate the divisions, with each side enforcing its own historical perspective and political ideology. It leaves little scope for real integration. I met and photographed young people from both sides – Bosnian Muslims and young Bosnian Serb students in Sarajevo. Both groups of young people spoke of wanting to break away from the constant talk of war and mistrust of the “other” – they just wanted to have a future in their own country. Tired of the nationalism and warlike rhetoric, these young people were part of a growing number who argue that it was never their war and that they should not have to carry its weight, nor have it drag them and their country down. As the light began to fade on the anniversary day, I rushed to the famous Žuta Tabuja viewpoint looking over the city to get some last-minute landscape shots. I didn’t know who the couple were in my frame, they were just strangers blocking my view. But as they reached out and embraced each other it became a photograph worth capturing. It seemed the perfect poster image to highlight Bosnia and Sarajevo 20 years on from war: an optimistic image representing all the young people I had photographed and spoken to earlier who longed for peace and opportunities in their country – in their Sarajevo, a city that had seen and suffered so much.

2/17/2022,"Last week, the White House issued an executive order announcing the theft of some $7bn. Shocking, to be sure. But more shocking still was when that same executive order also identified the thief: the White House.  In a move that can only be described as brazenly immoral and utterly unconscionable, the Biden administration has begun a process to seize the more than $7bn of assets that the Central Bank of Afghanistan has on deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Since the Taliban gained control of the war-ravaged country last year, that money has been frozen in place. Now, the administration has concocted its own mega-grift, planning to spend half of the money – not their money, lest we forget – for humanitarian aid in Afghanistan, while reserving the other half of the funds – not their money – for the relatives of the September 11 victims who have brought claims against the Taliban for the 2001 terrorist attacks. Did I mention that this is not their money? These funds belong to the people of Afghanistan and must remain with the people of Afghanistan. The fact that this must even be stated is mind boggling. There are ethical and practical reasons why Biden’s plan must be abandoned. First, why must ordinary Afghan citizens who had nothing to do with the September 11 attacks have their savings confiscated and their lives immiserated by bureaucrats in Washington? (Reports indicate that the Afghan assets in the Central Bank are composed of foreign exchange funds, the reserves of Afghanistan’s commercial banks, and ordinary people’s savings.) Without rehashing the story of how the Taliban came into existence in the first place, we can all agree that no one voted the Taliban into power in 1996. Why should the people of Afghanistan be held responsible for that group’s actions? Nor did any of the 19 hijackers who carried out the September 11 attacks come from Afghanistan. The truth is that the Afghan people have overwhelmingly been the victims of the Taliban and of al-Qaida, and to take Afghan money to pay grieving Americans in order to punish the Taliban is nothing less than larceny as collective punishment. And why does this kind of first-world financial hostage taking only move in one direction? After all, don’t the United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Russia, the UK and many other states also bear significant responsibility for the thousands upon thousands of civilian deaths in Afghanistan? The money allied forces occasionally offer in condolence payments is peanuts relative to the destruction they have caused. Once we conclude that the September 11 families deserve justice for their losses, which they do, then shouldn’t we also look for redress for the Afghan victims of allied violence? And yet, the idea that Afghans could seek legal means to abscond with the US Treasury due to the death of their people and the US role in the destruction of their country is laughable. This painful asymmetry illustrates the enduring colonial nature of international politics. Whatever legal wrangling about lawsuits and default judgments that this executive order is ostensibly meant to address, the message it sends is clear: American lives matter more than Afghan lives, and American tragedy looms larger than Afghan pain. But that pain is ongoing. From a Soviet invasion that thrust ordinary people into the middle of one of the hottest zones of the cold war, Afghanistan has endured 40 years of devastating turmoil, starting with the United States and the Soviet Union conscripting Afghans into their global conflict. (We’re approaching the 40th anniversary of Ronald Reagan proclaiming 21 March 1982 as Afghanistan Day.) Then, after 9/11, Afghans were soon subject to systematic torture at the hands of Americans at Bagram airbase, merciless American drone attacks, murderous night raids and so much more. Of course, the Taliban also bear enormous responsibility for their extraordinary violence and brutal repression, and helping them rebuild their power would be disastrous. But stealing the money of Afghanistan and distributing it as you see fit hardly furthers the interests of justice. It’s simply shocking that anyone, let alone the US government, thinks that it could. On the contrary, the people of Afghanistan are currently facing an economic collapse that is gargantuan in scope. A prolonged drought, the ravages of the pandemic, and the freezing of western aid since the Taliban seized power last year has left the country in shambles. At least 95% of households in the country are not consuming enough food to sustain themselves. One million Afghan children face acute hunger. Over three million suffer from malnutrition. Almost three-quarters of a million people were displaced from their homes from last year’s fighting, in a country where four million people had already been internally displaced. The administration argues that this executive order will free up funds that it will immediately distribute as aid. But the administration’s alchemy of transforming other people’s money into humanitarian assistance is also, practically speaking, shortsighted. The move will ultimately pauperize the nation even more, push it further into becoming a territory almost entirely dependent on foreign largesse. While there is an immediate demand for relief and assistance, what Afghanistan ultimately needs is its own functioning economy, which has now been made all the more difficult as the US essentially bankrupts the Afghan Central Bank. Biden’s executive order thus undermines a future of economic stability and growth. The national economy simply cannot function without a central bank and a reliable trading system. Even though some foreign currency is entering the country through entities such as the International Bank of Afghanistan, it’s not nearly enough and international commerce is nearly impossible in Afghanistan. As one shopkeeper in Kandahar, Haji Abdul Nafi, told the New York Times: “We cannot earn money for a living, we cannot do business with other countries, we cannot import and export goods – we are almost cut off from the world.” The idea that bankrupting the Afghan Central Bank will starve the Taliban begins to look even more ridiculous and craven when you discover that, under current US rules, non-governmental organizations operating in Afghanistan are “permitted to pay taxes, dues and import duties to the Taliban as long as the payments are related to the authorized activities”. This is probably the only way that some aid can enter the country, but it also illustrates just how hypocritical Biden’s executive order is. There have to be better solutions out there, and there are proposals being discussed that would allow the Afghan Central Bank to have its activities monitored by independent auditors to guarantee that none of the money is taken by the Taliban. Would that work? I don’t know, but what I do know is that this executive order is cruelty and theft masquerading as charity and justice, and it must be revoked before the damage it causes is beyond repair.

2/17/2022,"The programme notes for Jamaal Burkmar’s new show quote scenes from Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Scrubs and The Office, a taster of the 90s and 00s sitcoms that inspired Donuts. There is no laugh track or wordy jokes here, but there is something warm, fun and very watchable. It’s based around three friends, sitting around at home. They play and tease, riffing off one another in choreography that is thoroughly conversational. They are dancing directly to each other, as if saying: “Hey, look at this! Did you know that?” Specific gestures sometimes take the place of words. It’s very well observed, the delicate dynamics of friendship and the way interactions happen, how energy moves around a group and we mirror people as we connect with them.  Like a singer performing in a register close to their own speaking voice, the dancers, certainly at first, are close to their natural bodies. Burkmar ups the intensity later on, fusing funk styles with contemporary dance in a distinctive language, finding some nifty formulations of steps. At first this dance is Seinfeldian, in that it’s about nothing much. It mostly revolves around the myriad ways you can reconfigure yourselves on the sofa (Burkmar’s got to be first choice for the next John Lewis furniture ad). But some light drama and jeopardy creep in and the stakes are mildly raised, all hinging on the great rapport between the switched-on dancers, Maya Carroll, Iolanda Portogallo and Dorna Ashory. The jazz-funk soundtrack by Dutch producer Jameszoo is fabulous, the bodies speaking in sync with its noodling melodies. With an original voice and feelgood, accessible choreography, Donuts suggests Burkmar could go far.
