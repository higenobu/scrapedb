4/6/2022,"Ukrainian forces have claimed to have downed a Russian jet worth £38million as they continue to defend their country from Vladimir Putin's invasion. Images released by Ukrainian Armed Forces on Sunday showed the burning remains of an Su-35 fighter shot down near the city of Izyum, in the Kharkiv region. It is believed to be the first Su-35 which the Ukrainian forces have shot down since Putin ordered his troops to invade on 24 February. Video of a Russian soldier reported to be the pilot was shared on social media, showing him kneeling near the burning wreckage, although this was unverified. Ukrainian MP Anton Gerashchenko claimed the pilot ejected from the aircraft as it was going down and was captured as he tried to flee. The Su-35 is a twin-engine supermaneuverable fighter jet, bought into the Russian service in 2014. The 22m meter long aircraft can reach a top speed of 2,400kmh (1,500mph), and carries a number of weapons including rockets, air-to-air missiles and air-to-surface missiles. Russia is believed to have suffered significant losses since the conflict began, including thousands of soldiers and huge numbers of equipment. Watch: Volodymyr Zelensky sends appeal to Grammys over war in Ukraine Latest figures from local news in Ukraine have estimated over 18,000 troops have died, along with 143 planes, 644 tanks and thousands of other vehicles. While the figures cannot be independently verified, Western officials have pointed towards evidence of significant losses on the Russia side as they come up against stiff opposition. It was claimed over the weekend that two Russian soldiers died after eating pies laced with poison which Ukrainian citizens ""treated"" them with. The troops from the third Motor Rifle Division, are said to have died instantly after locals in Izium ""gifted"" them the pies. Another 28 soldiers have reportedly been rushed to hospital, and hundreds more are said to be suffering ""severe illness"" from poisoned food and drink given to them. Ukraine's Ministry of Defence Intelligence wrote on social media on Saturday: ""Ukrainians resist the occupiers by all available means. ""According to available information, local residents of the Izium district (Kharkiv region) 'treated' Russians from the third Motorized Rifle Division of the Russian Federation with poisoned pies. ""As a result, two occupiers died at once, another 28 were taken to the intensive care unit. Their current state is being clarified."" Putin has been accused of carrying out a genocide in Ukraine, after Ukraine's Ministry of Defence released images on Sunday showing what was left behind in the city of Bucha following a retreat of Russian forces.  Footage showed bodies left lying in the street, some with the hands tied behind their backs and shot in the head. Ukrainian authorities have claimed 410 civilians were killed in Bucha and Irpin, with mass graves being dug for the victims. In Motyzhyn, around 20 miles west of the city of Bucha, the mayor and her family were reportedly discovered in a mass grave. Ukraine's former ambassador to Austria Olexander Scherba said Olga Sukhenko was found buried with her husband and son. Of the 20 people found in the put, some bore the marks of torture, authorities said, including broken arms and fingers. Journalists who have visited the area since the Russians retreat have said there is ""clear evidence"" of war crimes being left behind, including that of torture and rape. Ukrainian Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russian forces of torturing and executing hundreds of people in a Facebook post after the bodies were discovered. “I want every mother of every Russian soldier to see the bodies of the killed people in Bucha, in Irpin, in Hostomel,” Zelensky said. “What did they do? Why were they killed?” “War crimes in Bucha and other cities during the Russian occupation will also be considered by the UN Security Council on Tuesday,” he added.",News/Yahoo News UK,Wreckage of £38m Russian fighter jet pictured burning in field,https://news.yahoo.com/wreckage-of-38-m-russian-fighter-jet-pictured-burning-in-field-090219348.html
4/6/2022,"A Watergate prosecutor compared Donald Trump's phone-log gap to the gap in a Richard Nixon call. She said Trump's gap might've hidden something more serious than what experts think Nixon omitted. ""A lot can be said in 457 minutes,"" Jill Wine-Banks wrote of Trump's call-log gap. A Watergate prosecutor on Saturday compared Donald Trump's missing January 6, 2021, phone logs to a minutes-long gap in one of Richard Nixon's calls related to the scandal that cost Nixon his presidency — and she concluded that Trump's case had the potential to be far more serious. ""It is often said that Nixon's cover-up was worse than his underlying crime. The reverse is potentially true for Trump,"" Jill Wine-Banks wrote in an op-ed article published by NBC News. ""Trump's records gap is 25 times as long as Nixon's, but his alleged crime could be incalculably worse,"" she concluded. Trump is under scrutiny over a gap of seven hours and 37 minutes in the White House's call logs on the day of the Capitol riot. The absence of these call records has also prompted the House January 6 committee to investigate what one unnamed lawmaker has called a ""possible cover-up."" ""A lot can be said in 457 minutes,"" Wine-Banks wrote. ""Comparisons to the 18.5-minute gap in a crucial President Richard Nixon recording were immediately obvious to me."" Wine-Banks, who cross-examined Nixon's secretary in 1973 about the gap, also observed she was ""not the only to make that connection"" between Trump and Nixon. ""First, Nixon's gap seems — based on my experience and other experts — to have been a deliberate erasure,"" she wrote. ""Is Trump's? We don't have enough evidence to say for sure yet, but the missing chunk certainly appears deliberate."" Wine-Banks said the missing information in Trump's case seemed ""suspicious"" and prompted a ""series of urgent follow-up questions."" ""It is unlikely, even incredible, that no one called in to the president for 457 minutes during a crisis when he was in the White House,"" she wrote. ""Even calls that go unanswered in the White House should be listed on official logs."" Wine-Banks added that while the gap in Nixon's conversation was ""about covering up a third-rate burglary,"" any calls that Trump made during the insurrection were notable given scrutiny about whether he broke any laws while trying to cling to power after losing to Joe Biden in the 2020 US election. The Watergate scandal centered on the Nixon administration's efforts to cover up its involvement in a 1972 break-in at the Democratic National Committee's headquarters in Washington, DC. The scandal led to Nixon's resignation from the presidency in August 1974. Parallels were often drawn between Watergate and the numerous scandals that plagued the White House during Trump's presidency.   Read the original article on Business Insider",Politics/INSIDER,A Watergate prosecutor says the 457-minute gap in Trump's White House call logs could be masking 'incalculably worse' behavior than Nixon's,https://news.yahoo.com/watergate-prosecutor-says-457-minute-032025094.html

The man’s friend and girlfriend waited for him at the bottom of the mountain, but he never made it back to them. He was found dead at the bottom of a 30-foot cliff, Utah police told news outlets. The 21-year-old skier died from his injuries at the Park City Mountain Resort on Friday, April 1, the Summit County Sheriff’s Office told the Park Record. The resort is about 30 miles southeast of Salt Lake City. The three of them had exited the King Con lift and rode down the mountain, deputies told KSL. “When the girlfriend and friend got to the bottom of the run, they waited for the now deceased to come down the mountain,” Lt. Andrew Wright told KSL. “The girlfriend got help from a ski patroller, who radioed for other patrollers to head down the same run to look for the 21-year-old.” The skier was found at the bottom of a 30-foot cliff or embankment, according to KSL. He died from his injuries, KUTV reported. There were no witnesses to the incident. Deputies have not given the man’s identity, according to KUTV. The death is under investigation. “Park City Mountain and the entire Vail Resorts family extend our deepest sympathy and support to the family and friends of this guest,” Mike Goar, the vice president and chief operating officer of the resort, told the Park Record.

Olha Sukhenko, leader of the village of Motyzhyn, together with her husband Ihor Sukhenko and their son Oleksandr, were taken captive by Russian forces two to three days before troops left the village, according to locals. Their bodies were discovered on Monday, covered in sand. Vadym Tokar, head of the Makariv village council which neighbors Motyzhyn, said: ""The bodies are still lying there, we can't get them out because there is a suspicion that they are mined."" Evidence of widespread atrocities committed by Russian troops has emerged in recent days as soldiers withdrew from Kyiv and the surrounding regions. Ukraine's Ministry of Defence released a series of harrowing images on Sunday from the town of Bucha, showing bodies left lying in the street, some with the hands tied behind their backs and shot in the head. Locals said some victims were shot in the eyes by Russian soldiers. On Monday, US President Joe Biden called fro Vladimir Putin to be prosecuted for war crimes. ""You saw what happened in Bucha,"" Biden told reporters, saying the Russian president ""is a war criminal"" and there should be ""a war crimes trial"". Mass graves have been uncovered, and media who have visited the area since the Russians retreat have said there is ""clear evidence"" of war crimes, including torture and rape. The destruction has led to accusations that Vladimir Putin is carrying out a genocide. Russia has denied that its troops have been targeting civilians, saying reports of mass slaughter were ""staged"" to sully Russia's name. Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior ministry, spoke to reporters as he revealed the bodies believed to be the Sukhenko, family. ""There have been Russian occupiers here. They tortured and murdered the whole family of the village head,"" he said. ""The occupiers suspected they were collaborating with our military, giving us locations of where to target our artillery.

According to the national park, the bales were on a German ship sunk by the U.S. off Brazil's coast during World War II. ""Rubber bales like this one started washing up on Texas and Florida beaches in 2020, but before that, they were washing up on beaches in Brazil,"" Padre Island National Seashore wrote alongside a photo of one of the bales. The post goes on to explain that in January 1944, the SS Rio Grande, a German blockade runner, was carrying tin, copper, cobalt, and crude rubber bales when it was spotted by the USS Omaha and USS Jouett off the coast of Brazil. ""Realizing that they had been spotted, the crew of the Rio Grande abandoned the ship and its cargo after purposely trying to sink (ie scuttle) it,"" the park explained.

4/6/2022,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, long an advocate of Western rapprochement with Russia, expressed regret for his earlier stance, saying his years of support for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline had been a clear mistake. Steinmeier, a Social Democrat who served as Foreign Minister under Chancellor Angela Merkel before being elevated to the presidency, said Russia's invasion of Ukraine meant he and others had to reckon honestly with what they had got wrong. ""My adherence to Nord Stream 2 was clearly a mistake,"" he said. ""We were sticking to a bridge in which Russia no longer believed and which other partners had warned us against."" Steinmeier was a prominent member of a wing of his Social Democratic Party, led by former Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, that argued close economic ties to Russia were a way of anchoring it within a western-oriented global system. The now-cancelled Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which critics said would have weakened Ukraine by cutting it out of the energy transit business, was a centrepiece of that strategy. That has triggered a growing backlash, with critics on social media repeatedly tweeting past pictures of him affectionately embracing Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, while Ukraine's ambassador Andrij Melnyk has been outspoken in his criticism. When Steinmeier arranged a ""solidarity concert"" for Ukraine, Melnyk tweeted sarcastically that the only soloists appeared to be Russian. ""An affront,"" he wrote. ""Sorry, I'm not coming."" Germany's president is meant to be a unifying figure who stands above the cut and thrust of daily politics, one who enjoys the moral authority to exhort people to better behaviour. ""We failed to build a common European house,"" Steinmeier said. ""I did not believe Vladimir Putin would embrace his country's complete economic, political and moral ruin for the sake of his imperial madness,"" he added. ""In this, I, like others, was mistaken.""

Since then he has been able to maintain the results he achieved through diet and working out, and is now seeking ""incremental"" ways to continue to improve on his personal fitness. In a new video, he documents his experience of doing additional pushups, pullups and ab work every day for a period of 60 days to see what effect it has on his strength and body composition. On top of his regular training, Jones begins doing an extra 15-minute workout each morning comprising 3 sets of 15 pushups, 3 sets of 45-second core-activating planks, and 3 sets of 8 pullups. He also does left-handed band pulls to build some strength in that arm which will help add balance to his upper-body exercises. ""The one thing that's been kind of tough is motivating myself to get to the second workout in the evening, which is always the hardest workout of the day,"" he says. However, as he remains consistent in his training, Jones soon begins to see results, most notably in his increased upper-body strength: five weeks into the challenge, his ability to do ring muscleups has improved. ""I am just over halfway through and I already feel so much stronger, it is shocking,"" he says. ""When I started I was on 15 pushups, now I have moved that up to 4 sets of 20 and can do that comfortably. Pullups have progressed from 2 sets of 8 to 4 sets of 10... I've also realized I can use this high frequency training to focus on things like improving with my rings pullups, working on explosive pullups.""

4/6/2022,"By Krishna N. Das NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India on Tuesday condemned the killings of civilians in Ukraine's Bucha and called for an independent investigation, having earlier declined to explicitly criticise the invasion of Ukraine by its long-time partner Russia. A Ukrainian human rights ombudswoman said on Tuesday that between 150 and 300 bodies may be in a mass grave by a church in the town of Bucha, where Ukraine accuses Russian troops of killing civilians. Moscow denies targeting civilians in Ukraine, calling images of the dead in Bucha that have shocked the world a ""monstrous forgery"" staged by the West to discredit it. ""Recent reports of civilian killings in Bucha are deeply disturbing,"" T.S. Tirumurti, India's permanent representative to the United Nations, told a meeting of the Security Council. ""We unequivocally condemn these killings and support the call for an independent investigation."" Tirumurti delivered his speech shortly after U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had a phone conversation with India's foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. The United States has repeatedly urged India to condemn Russia's aggression since the Feb. 24 invasion. India heavily relies on Russia for military hardware. New Delhi has repeatedly called for an end to violence in Ukraine, but has abstained from various U.N. resolutions on the war in a tricky attempt at balancing its ties with Moscow and the West.

4/6/2022,"INDIANAPOLIS — For decades, the identity of an elusive figure, dubbed the “Days Inn” and “I-65” killer, evaded police as investigators tried to solve the slayings of three women in Indiana and Kentucky in the late 1980s. Tuesday, law enforcement officials said they’ve solved the case. Indiana State Police, alongside several federal and local agencies, said investigators have determined that Harry Edward Greenwell, who is now deceased, was responsible for the rapes and murders of Vicki Heath, Margaret “Peggy” Gill and Jeanne Gilbert. Investigators have also linked him through further DNA analysis to a sexual assault of a woman in 1990 in Columbus, Indiana. Greenwell died in 2013 at 68 years old. The young women worked as clerks in motels along the I-65 corridor. 'I-65 KILLER': What we know about the suspect and the victims Police on Tuesday said there's a ""distinct possibility"" Greenwell could be linked to a number of other unsolved murders, rapes, robberies and assaults. Sgt. Glen Fifield of the Indiana State Police said investigators were continuing to investigate whether he's connected to other violent crimes in the Midwest. The man’s identification bookends an investigation that’s spanned 35 years. The search for the killer began in 1987 when Heath was found assaulted and shot to death behind a Super 8 motel in Elizabethtown, Kentucky. In 1989, two more women fell victim to the killer. Gill, a 24-year-old overnight auditor at a Days Inn in Merrillville, was sexually assaulted and killed in the early morning hours of March 3. An eerily similar attack occurred at another Days Inn dozens of miles away on the same night. Gilbert, a part-time auditor for the Remington motel, was also attacked and assaulted. A motorist saw her body on the side of the road in White County. Police said both women were shot with the same .22 caliber handgun. Kentucky State Police in 2010 said DNA found at Heath’s killing linked to the deaths of Gill and Gilbert. The DNA also linked the same attacker behind a 1990 sexual assault of a clerk at a Days Inn in Columbus, Indiana. In that case, the clerk got away. Police on Tuesday said a DNA match to Greenwell was made through a close family member, returning a 99.99% probability, and credited the DNA analysis for the major breakthrough in the case. ""There are detectives in this room that have been involved in this for some form or another for literally generations. They're owed a debt of gratitude we can never possibly repay,"" said Indiana State Police Superintendent Doug Carter. ""I hope today might bring a little bit of solace to know that the animal who did this is no longer on this Earth."" The reveal of the Days Inn killer’s name also provided some closure to the victims’ families about the identity of the person who murdered their loved one. Kim Gilbert Wright, Gilbert's daughter, said the families may never know why their relatives suffered the horrific fate, but said some justice was served in finally revealing the killer's identity. ""I'd like to believe that whatever each of us defines as justice, or what each of us might define as closure, that we're all now able to share the healing process knowing the long known attacker has now been brought out of the dark, into the light,"" Wright, an attorney, said. The case of the I-65 killer began with Heath’s horrific killing. In February 1987, customers at the Super 8 Motel found no one at the front desk. The lobby was torn apart. The prospective patrons called the police to investigate the strange scene. Police made the grisly discovery near a trash bin at the back of the motel. Heath had been assaulted and shot twice in the head. The bloody crime rocked the town of Elizabethtown, Kentucky. Two years later, the killer carried out gruesomely similar attacks on the same night. Gill, a 24-year-old night auditor at the Days Inn in Merrillville, was attacked and killed in the wee hours of March 3, 1989. Roughly 50 miles south, Gilbert, a part-time auditor at the Days Inn in Remington, was found shot to death on the side of the road by a motorist driving through White County. Police determined they were killed by bullets from the same gun. Both motels had been robbed. In total, the killer swiped $426. Gilbert was a working mother in the throes of business courses at St. Joseph’s College, an Indianapolis Star article reported. Gill loved to bake, paint and cross stitch. She worked her way up from being a maid at the motel to an auditor position. Gill’s family displayed some of her cross-stitch pieces at her funeral, the article said, including one depicting the Last Supper, next to her coffin. The women's families told the Indianapolis Star months after the killing that they were still coping with the deaths – but not forgetting. Gill’s parents at the time said they don’t speak about revenge – just uncertainty. Her mother called the lack of a suspect at the time a “mixed blessing.” “In some ways, it’s peace not to have to look at someone. But you read about something else and you wonder ‘was that him, too?’” Anna Gill said.

4/6/2022,"On the evening of February 23, just a few hours before Vladimir Putin's army crossed into Ukrainian territory, a message from Amazon arrived in the inbox of Vladimir Smirnov, a programmer from St. Petersburg. It was a work permit for a software engineer position in Ireland. Smirnov had begun interviewing for the position at Amazon in January, when U.S. intelligence first stepped up its concerns about Putin’s plans for war in Ukraine. The fact that war was truly coming became clear to Smirnov two days earlier during Putin's televised address to the nation, in which he recognized the independence of the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, Ukrainian territories that have been under Russian control since 2014. “He gave his verdict to the nation and, indirectly, declared war,” Smirnov said. “My whole family watched that vicious speech and trembled.” It's one thing to know that war has been declared. It's quite another to wake up on February 24 to the news of bombings. On the very same morning, Smirnov was in no doubt that he needed to leave Russia. Having dressed, he went to take a COVID-19 test so he could fly to neighboring Georgia as soon as possible, after which he would travel on to Ireland. Nik Shevchenko, the 22-year-old chief executive of the startup WeLoveNoCode, also decided to leave Russia. Fearing that martial law would be introduced in Russia, forcing the borders shut, Shevchenko bought a plane ticket to Portugal, where he remains now. “First they close the borders,” Shevchenko said, “and then they force you to kill. I’m fit for military service, unfortunately, but I don’t want to kill innocent people.” Natalia Chebotar, a former top manager at Yandex and one of the leading Russian specialists in edtech, left Russia with her family when Putin ordered the placement of “all nuclear deterrence forces in a special regime,” a veiled threat of nuclear posturing not seen since the Cold War. Yuri Malyugin, a former lead product designer at technology company SberAutoTech, bought a ticket to Georgia — where Russians can stay for up to a year without a visa — when, one by one, IT companies and services began leaving Russia. A user experience designer from Moscow who wishes to remain anonymous recounted how, a couple of days into the war, his work computer became “a useless piece of plastic.” The software stopped working, and his company could no longer receive payments from foreign colleagues or pay its employees in Europe after Russia was disconnected from SWIFT in early March. “The last straw was when we tried to transfer the salary to our employee in Ukraine,” the designer said. “At that moment, he was at home in Mariupol. The city was already under bombardment and a curfew had been imposed. The last message we received from him was: ‘I have no money left. I’m looking out the window and see mobile crematoria approaching my house.’ After that we heard nothing more from him.” According to estimates by the Russian Association for Electronic Communications, or RAEK, some 70,000 IT specialists fled Russia in February and March. RAEK experts predict that Russia may lose a further 100,000 specialists in April, who are currently held back by the need to tie up affairs in Moscow, as well as high ticket prices. (After the start of the war, more than 30 countries closed their airspace to Russian aircraft, while Boeing and Airbus stopped servicing Russian fleets and began recalling leased aircraft.) Behind the scenes, Google is already pulling its team out of Russia. The British startup Arrival relocated its Russian employees to other countries. The Miro platform, according to Kommersant, transferred its team from the Russian city of Perm to Amsterdam. “After February 24, charter flights began taking IT professionals out of Russia,” said Anastasia Mirolyubova, co-founder of Immigram, an immigration platform for IT specialists and entrepreneurs. But the second wave of emigration, anticipated in April, may not come to be. From the very beginning of the war, departing tech IT specialists have attracted the special attention of Russia's FSB — a government organization associated with contract killings and poisonings of Russians who oppose Putin’s regime. Once the war had started in Ukraine, interrogation of IT specialists crossing the Russian border became commonplace. One CGI artist from Moscow recalls how on February 28 he was detained by customs officers at passport control in Sheremetyevo Airport, where he was taken to a room and questioned by an FSB officer. He was asked about his opinion on the “special military operation” in Ukraine and whether he knew anything about hackers associated with Anonymous. On March 8, before departing from an airport in Novosibirsk, a staff member in plain clothes questioned a manager from another IT company. “He asked what languages I can write in, if I can hack into programs, if I know about white, gray or black hats. I said that I’m not involved with hacking, to which he answered: ‘That’s a pity.’” “IT people who have fled Russia do not want to waste their abilities on war and other crap that negatively affects humanity. IT is the internet, and the internet is freedom.” Nik Shevchenko, WeLoveNoCode CEO Following the news about interrogations on the border, a channel titled “Russian Border Control” appeared on Telegram — at the time of writing, it had more than 24,000 subscribers — to allow users to share their experiences. The channel’s administrator, who wishes to remain anonymous, said he posted more than 500 border crossing stories in the course of a month, most of which featured the IT industry in one way or another. On March 8, more than a week after the war broke out, a programmer who flew from Moscow to Tbilisi noted that “everyone is allowed through the border, but if guards hear the word ‘IT,’ then people are taken away for questioning.” Another programmer recalled a scene at the airport in the southern Russian city of Mineralnye Vody on March 9: “There were six of us flying out, but when two of us uttered the phrases ‘software tester’ and ‘online platform’ while talking with the border guards, they were immediately sent to some room.” A system administrator flying from Russia to Bahrain on March 12 said that airport employees in plain clothes pressed him for the names of the services for which he works and also checked his phone, looking for “protest,” “Ukraine,” “Putin,” and “war” in his chat and browser history. Another traveler, who asked not to be named, said that once the war had started in Ukraine, interrogation of tech workers crossing the Russian border became commonplace. One IT specialist said his devices were taken away from him, with the promise to return them upon arrival and the words: ""Let's leave the motherland’s secrets in the motherland.” The FSB has not commented on these inspections. A former employee of Russia's Ministry of Internal Affairs “K” Department — the ministry's unit dedicated to investigating cybercrime — said he knows nothing about it. According to him, such checks can only be explained if they concern public officials. The ongoing registration of IT specialists at the border looks like an orchestrated campaign that, like the war, may quickly escalate to something worse. Nailya Aglickaya, a public relations manager from Moscow, said she left Russia on March 8, and after a two-hour interrogation, the border guard told her: “So you’re not an IT specialist? You should have said so. We only detain IT specialists.” A programmer from St. Petersburg, who relocated to the Armenian capital Yerevan in early March, recalled how a computer monitor with an open Excel sheet was slightly turned toward him during his interrogation, so he could see the border guard entering data. “The table listed the names of all those interrogated, their phone numbers, addresses, and attitude towards the situation in Ukraine,” he recalled. “But in the column marked ‘type of activity,’ they entered only one of two options: ‘IT’ or ‘not IT.’” The rise of the IT sector in Russia is widely attributed to the presidency of Dmitry Medvedev, the ""geek president"" who took office in 2008. Medvedev traveled around the U.S., where he toured Silicon Valley, dined with then-U.S. President Barack Obama, and marveled at the possibilities of the recently debuted iPhone. In 2010, Medvedev initiated the construction in Russia of something in between California’s IT mecca and Soviet science cities: the Skolkovo Innovation Center. One technocrat at the top was followed by more. Former Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich became the president of the Skolkovo Foundation. The head of the Federal Tax Service, Mikhail Mishustin, digitized the bureaucratic system under his control and soon became Russia's prime minister. The policy of Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin was aimed at making the capital a technological city, the example of Singapore providing a source of inspiration. But since February 24 — the day Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine — the rhetoric of the authorities has changed. Medvedev, who in 2009 declared that the most important thing in life is love, now no longer precludes the possibility that the death penalty may return to Russia. On March 18, Arkady Dvorkovich left his post as head of Skolkovo after giving an anti-war speech. Anatoly Chubais, the head of the Rosnanotech state corporation and Putin's climate envoy, became another émigré; journalists found him trying to withdraw money from an ATM in Istanbul. On the Moscow metro, people no longer have to wear masks, allowing the “Sphere” facial recognition system to identify the faces of citizens who attend anti-war protests. Under a recently enacted anti-""fake news” law, Russians can face up to 15 years in prison.

After leaving Russia, WeLoveNoCode's Shevchenko announced that 10% of margin revenue in March would go to Ukrainian charities working with refugees and the wounded. Under the treason article of Russia’s Criminal Code, the startup’s actions could lead to a 20-year prison sentence. “But fuck it,” Shevchenko said. “I feel very sorry for the people who are dying. I don't care about being arrested."" According to a migration specialist who asked not to be named for fear of retribution from the Russian government, interrogations at the border are another way of intimidating citizens. “Intellectuals are leaving Russia — people who have access to a great amount of information and critical thinking. 99.9% of them are IT professionals. What does this mean for the government? It views them as extremists and enemies of the state who need additional checks,” she said. “Besides, the situation in the country will be much easier to control once the brains are abroad.” The migration specialist said they are certain that IT specialists who left Russia in February and March will return to the country in the coming months. “Those who are unable to find international projects will return, as will those who lose hope.” But the old life they knew in a country abandoned by AMD, Adobe, Apple, General Electric, IBM, Intel, MasterCard, Visa and others no longer exists. “Russian IT people face a new reality,” said a senior machine learning engineer who worked in Moscow remotely for an American company. “The best way of describing it is as a ‘digital gulag.’” To keep specialists in Russia, Putin signed a decree on incentives for IT companies on March 8. Income tax will be reduced from 3% to zero and IT workers under the age of 27 will receive deferments from military service — a major incentive in a country where all men aged 18 to 27 are subject to Russia's obligatory military conscription, especially in a time of war. Following this news, the leading online education platform in Russia, Skillbox, noted a sharp rise in interest in courses relating to programming. “In other areas such as management, marketing and design, we did not see a similar increase,” said Artem Kazakov, Skillbox's commercial director. But concessions for IT are of no interest to those who have already left Russia. “IT can no longer exist in its usual form,” said Yuri Malyugin, a lead product designer. “Russia's attractiveness for corporate investment has been lost for a long time to come. We will not have access to familiar technologies. Software will not work. We are talking about a rollback to 10 to 15 years ago.” Ukraine’s Mykhailo Fedorov talks about corporate sanctions and running a government during wartime Meta takes down deepfake of Ukraine’s President Zelensky surrendering Russia’s war hits Yandex, the ‘Google of Russia’ Anastasia Mirolyubova also talked about an isolated and government-controlled IT cluster inside Russia. “The examples of North Korea and Iran show that it is possible to create new technologies within closed countries, but they will not go beyond the country’s borders.” WeLoveNoCode CEO Shevchenko predicts a similar lunge backward in Russia's tech capabilities: ""Theoretically, we could return for a while to ordering a taxi over the phone, rather than online,"" he said. Shevchenko interviews Russian “no-coders” for jobs every day. And, according to him, the people who left Russia after February 24 display better skills than those who do not plan to leave the country. “IT people who have fled Russia do not want to waste their abilities on war and other crap that negatively affects humanity. IT is the internet, and the internet is freedom.” According to the recruitment service HeadHunter, since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, the government demand for IT specialists in wartime Russia has already increased by 100%. The shortage of specialists, according to former Yandex top manager Natalia Chebotar, will be easy to remedy. “I have been aware of the federal program for [the] digital economy for three months now,” she said. “A goal of this program is to have 1 million IT specialists in Russia. But the experts are leaving, so what needs to be done to prevent [key performance indicators] from decreasing? Stop IT specialists from leaving the country. I think this could happen in a few days or weeks. So far everything that I predicted has come true.” On March 24, Concord -- the company owned by businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin and the alleged owner of the “troll factory” in St. Petersburg that is believed to have interfered with the U.S. presidential election in 2016 -- published on the social network Vkontakte a version of a proposed bill to keep IT people in Russia. On the same day, Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, called Prigozhin's project “a groundless rumor” and explained that a ban on the exit of citizens would be a violation of constitutional rights. Curiously, the same Putin spokesman publicly stated on February 20 that Russia had no plans to invade Ukraine. “According to our president, those leaving Russia are people whose hearts already live in the West,” concluded Vladimir Smirnov, the programmer from St. Petersburg who left for Ireland. “But we’re just afraid of losing contact with the wider world.”",World/TechCrunch,Tech workers describe detentions and interrogations as they flee Russia,https://news.yahoo.com/tech-workers-describe-detentions-interrogations-180018240.html
4/6/2022,"WASHINGTON ― Last year, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) opposed President Joe Biden’s nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to a seat on the D.C. federal appeals court. On Monday, the Utah Republican voted to advance Jackson’s nomination to the Supreme Court, a rare reversal in the deeply divided Senate, where ugly confirmation fights over the highest court in the land are quickly becoming the norm. “In her previous confirmation vote, I had concerns about whether or not she was in the mainstream,” Romney told reporters on Tuesday. “And having spent time with her personally and reviewing her testimony before Congress [I] became convinced that she is in the mainstream.” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) is supporting Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson for a seat on the Supreme Court after opposing her nomination to a lower court last year. (Photo: Photo by Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post via Getty Images) In announcing his support for Jackson, which came as a bit of a surprise, Romney called the judge a “well-qualified jurist” and a “person of honor” even though he said they may differ on ideological grounds. For Romney and the other two Republicans backing Jackson ― Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska ― Jackson’s nomination is an opportunity to dial down some of the sharp rhetoric that has come to define high court confirmations and restore public confidence in the institution. “We’re following a different standard today than we followed 20 years ago, when individuals are judged based upon simply their qualifications, and now we’re looking to determine something about other matters,” Romney said Tuesday, describing the Senate confirmation process. Republicans launched ugly and misleading accusations against Jackson over her quite mainstream record of sentencing sex offenders, cherry-picking cases and ignoring similar sentences handed down by Republican-appointed judges. The GOP senators who are backing Jackson are even being smeared as “pro-pedophile” by some on the right. Murkowski, Collins, and Romney are pro-pedophile.They just voted for #KBJ. — Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (@RepMTG) April 5, 2022 Fears are growing that a president may never again get their Supreme Court nominee confirmed if their party doesn’t control the Senate. Republicans infamously denied President Barack Obama a chance to fill a Supreme Court seat in 2016, refusing to even give his nominee, Merrick Garland, a hearing. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was noncommittal about the possibility of a 2023 Supreme Court confirmation hearing, the third year of Biden’s presidency, if the GOP retakes control of the chamber. “Well, we’d have to wait and see what happens,” McConnell said last year. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), meanwhile, was far more explicit on that point, suggesting Monday that Republicans would not have held hearings on Jackson’s nomination if they were in control of the Senate. “If we were in charge, she would not have been before this committee. You would’ve had somebody more moderate than this,” Graham said. Graham voted to confirm Jackson to her current seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit last year. But in a reverse-Romney move, Graham is opposing Jackson’s nomination to the Supreme Court ― the first time he’ll oppose a Supreme Court pick since joining the Senate in 2003. “Now that you’re talking about Supreme Court, you’re making policy, not just bound by it,” Graham said Monday to explain his opposition to Jackson.

4/6/2022,"Russian forces on Tuesday reportedly struck a tank of nitric acid in Ukraine’s Luhansk region, sparking panicked warnings for residents to protect their faces and remain indoors. Serhiy Gaidai, the head of the Luhansk regional administration, issued a video address warning residents the toxic fumes can cause “severe damage.” “Prepare protective face masks soaked in soda solution. When applied locally to the eyes, nitric acid causes severe damage with extensive necrosis of the cornea and conjunctiva, leading to loss of vision,” he said, urging those living near Rubizhne to remain indoors and seal up their windows. “This chemical is very toxic and we don’t know where the toxic cloud will go. We will be monitoring the air and waiting for rain,” he said. The alarming warning came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky prepared to address the United Nations Security Council on mounting evidence of Russian war crimes against Ukraine. In comments to Ukrainian media, Zelensky vowed that Ukrainian authorities would create an “internal mechanism” to track down the Russian soldiers accused of committing war crimes against Ukrainian civilians, much like Israel’s Mossad hunted down Nazi fugitives across the globe. “We will definitely deal with this,” he said, adding that “lists will be compiled” of all those Russians accused of executing and torturing Ukrainian civilians. “There are people who really want to find these criminals,” he said. “Prosecutors of various nations will deal with all of these crimes… They see a great deal of evidence. And, unfortunately, the evidence will only keep coming—there will not be any less. There is still Izyum ahead, and many places where there is still no access [for Ukrainian authorities]—the occupied Melitopol, Berdyansk—we have no idea what happened there,” he said. His comments came as the scale of Russian atrocities in the town of Bucha, a Kyiv suburb, left the world reeling, with hundreds of innocent residents found slain in the streets, some with signs of torture. Newly released satellite footage from the now-liberated town showed that the bodies of slaughtered civilians had littered the streets for weeks before Ukrainian forces reclaimed the territory from Russia, debunking Moscow’s shameless claim that Putin’s troops didn’t kill “a single civilian” there and that it must have been Ukrainian forces. Russia’s Defense Ministry has claimed the executions were “staged” by Ukrainian psy-ops specialists, a claim that was echoed in a full-blown propaganda campaign on Russian state TV that said Western intelligence services were behind the killings. In the face of those Russian denials on Tuesday, Ukrainian media released aerial video that purportedly captures Russian troops in Bucha firing directly at a man who was simply riding past them on a bicycle. Ukrainian journalist Dmytro Komarov also shared footage from Bucha showing the aftermath of Russia’s attacks on Ukrainian evacuees. He said at least three vehicles of civilians were found shot up along an evacuation route, including a bus with a young couple inside and a vehicle where an elderly couple were slain.

4/6/2022,"By Simon Gardner BUCHA, Ukraine (Reuters) - A man lay sprawled by the roadside in the Ukrainian city of Bucha on Sunday, his hands tied behind his back and a bullet wound to his head, one of hundreds of local residents that officials say have been found dead in the wake of five weeks of Russian occupation. Bucha's deputy mayor, Taras Shapravskyi, said 50 of the dead residents, found after Russian forces withdrew from the city late last week, were the victims of extra-judicial killings carried out by Russian troops, and the officials have accused Moscow of war crimes. Russia's defence ministry said in a statement issued on Sunday that all photographs and videos published by the Ukrainian authorities alleging 'crimes' by Russian troops in Bucha were a ""provocation,"" and no resident of Bucha suffered violence at the hands of Russian troops. Reuters was not able to independently verify who was responsible for killing the dead residents. But three bodies seen by Reuters reporters on Sunday -- the corpse with the hands bound and two others which did not have bound hands -- bore bullet shots to the head consistent with what Bucha mayor Anatoliy Fedoruk and his deputy described as executions. In all three cases, there were no signs of any other significant injuries elsewhere in the body. All three people shot in the head were male, and all three were dressed in civilian clothing. On the body of the person whose hands were bound, there were powder burn marks on his lips and face. Such marks can mean a person was shot at close range. The cloth used to bind the man's hands appeared to be a white armband. Russian troops, while they were in Bucha, required that local residents wear the armbands to identify themselves, according to one woman who was still wearing hers. Reuters sent questions to the Kremlin and the Russian defence ministry about the corpses that its reporters had witnessed, but received no immediate reply. Russia's defence ministry, in its statement on Sunday said: ""During the time that Russian armed forces were in control of this settlement, not a single local resident suffered from any violent actions."" It added that before Russian troops withdrew on March 30 they delivered 452 tons of humanitarian aid to civilians around the Kyiv region. Shapravskyi, the deputy mayor, said some 300 people were found dead after the Russian withdrawal. Of these, he said officials so far have logged 50 as executions carried out by Russian forces. Reuters could not independently verify those figures. The others were either killed in crossfire, or their deaths are so far unexplained. ""Any war has some rules of engagement for civilians. The Russians have demonstrated that they were consciously killing civilians,"" Fedoruk, the mayor, said as he showed Reuters reporters one of the bodies. SHALLOW GRAVE Reuters also spoke to one local resident who described a person being found dead after Russian troops detained them, and another resident who described two people found dead with single gunshot wounds to the head. Reuters was not able to independently verify the descriptions provided by the residents. Sobbing as she gestured at her husband's shallow grave, a shot of vodka topped with a cracker resting on freshly dug earth, Tetyana Volodymyrivna recounted an ordeal at the hands of Russian troops in this city 37 km (23 miles) northwest of Kyiv. She and her husband, a former Ukrainian marine, were dragged from their apartment when Russian troops set up their command centre in their building. The soldiers held them prisoner in the apartment building where they lived. She said the Russians, when they arrived in the city, asked people who they were, and demanded to see documents. She said a fighter with the Russian forces who she believed was from Russia's semi-autonomous Chechnya region warned he would ""cut us up."" She did not say how she knew he was Chechen. Reuters sent a request for comment to the office of the leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, a Kremlin loyalist, but received no reply. Tetyana, who identified herself by her first name and patronymic but did not give her family name, was released after being held for four days. Her husband was nowhere to be seen for several days, until she was told about some bodies in a basement stairwell of the building where she and her husband lived. ""I recognised him by his sneakers, his trousers. He looked mutilated, his body was cold,"" she said. ""My neighbor still has a picture of his face. He had been shot in the head, mutilated, tortured."" Reuters reviewed the photograph, which showed that the face and body were badly mutilated. The news agency could not determine if there was a bullet wound. After recovering her husband's body, she and some neighbours buried it in a garden plot near their building, just deep enough ""so dogs wouldn't eat him,"" she said. Another corpse still lay in the stairwell where her husband was found, a Reuters reporter saw. Local residents covered the body with a bedsheet as a mark of dignity. ""SHOT IN LEFT EYE"" Around the corner, another grave contained the remains of two men, a woman resident told Reuters. She said the men had been taken away by Russian troops. She did not witness them being killed. When the bodies were found, both had been shot through the left eye, she said. Six other residents gathered near the grave said her account was correct. One of the residents said she recognised one of the dead men as a tenant in the apartment complex, who she said was a retired member of the Ukrainian military. Bucha was captured in the days immediately after the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces who swept south, capturing the defunct nuclear reactor at Chernobyl and moving southwards toward the capital. Bucha and the northern outskirts of nearby Irpin were the point at which the Russian advance from the northwest was halted after they met with unexpectedly fierce resistance from Ukrainian forces. The area witnessed some of the bloodiest fighting of the battle for the capital, until Russian forces pulled back from north of Kyiv. Moscow said in late March it was regrouping to focus on battles in eastern Ukraine. On Saturday, Ukraine said its forces had retaken all areas around Kyiv and that it now had complete control of the capital region for the first time since the invasion. On Sunday, roads in Bucha were littered with unexploded ordnance. Rockets poked out of the tarmac near burned-out wrecks of tanks. Some residents scrawled ""Beware, mines"" on their walls in chalk after finding booby traps or missiles on their premises. Resident Volodomir Kopachov said Russians troops had set up a rocket system in a vacant lot next to his garden. When a Reuters reporter visited, boxes of ammunition and spent shell casings littered the ground. Kopachov, a Ukrainian dog breeder, was in mourning. He said his 33-year-old daughter, her boyfriend and a friend were shot dead by Russian troops after firing a party streamer towards them just days before the pullback. Kopachov's wife said they fired the streamer as a gesture of defiance, not with the intent of harming the soldiers. ""It is so hard to go through it all,"" said the 69-year-old,"" as 10 Alabai, a breed of prized Central Asian Shepherd dog, barked in his backyard. Kopachov said he had not ventured beyond the gates of his house for a month. ""They were killing [people] on the spot. No one asked: 'who you are, why you are out?'. The men were simply shot."" The Kremlin denies that it has invaded Ukraine, saying it is carrying out a ""special military operation"" to degrade the Ukrainian armed forces and is targeting military installations rather than carrying out strikes on civilian areas. Speaking in Hostomel, near Bucha, on Sunday, Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov said: ""This is not a special operation, these are not police actions... These are inhumans who simply committed crimes against civilians.""

4/6/2022,"On Tuesday, Reuters reported that Putin warned that sanctions will to a global food crisis. He also warned that the Kremlin may export to only countries that are ""friendly"" with Russia. A Russian official called food a ""quiet weapon"" in the fight against Western sanctions, last week. Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that sanctions imposed by Western nations will lead to a global food crisis, Reuters reported. Putin said higher energy prices and fertilizer shortages will mean Western nations would have to print more money to buy supplies, which would cause food shortages in poorer countries. ""They will inevitably exacerbate food shortages in the poorest regions of the world, spur new waves of migration, and in general drive food prices even higher,"" Putin said in a meeting on developing food production, Reuters reported. Putin also suggested that Russia won't export food to countries that are ""hostile"" to it. ""We will have to be more careful about food supplies abroad, especially carefully monitor the exports to countries which are hostile to us,"" Putin said, according to Reuters. Last week, former Russian president and senior security official Dmitry Medvedev also threatened that Russia ""will not supply our products and agricultural products to our enemies."" That measure would be in retaliation for sanctions, Medvedev said in a message on his Telegram channel, adding that food a ""quiet weapon"" ""We will supply food and crops only to our friends,"" he said. Both Russia and Ukraine are major exporters of wheat and corn. Russia accounts for almost 17% of global supply of wheat, making it the largest exporter of the crop, according to an ING report. Ukraine accounts for 12% of wheat supplies and 17% of corn supply. A World Bank spokesperson previously told Insider's Urooba Jamal that ""the war in Ukraine comes at a bad time for the world.""

4/6/2022,"Ukraine's president condemned European leaders for their 2008 decision not to let Ukraine join NATO. Zelenskyy's comments followed shocking reports of mass casualties in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv. Germany and France shot down Ukraine's bid to join NATO during a summit in 2008. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy invited former German Chancellor Angela Merkel to look at the mass graves in Bucha, saying they were the result of her 2008 decision not to let Ukraine join NATO. Zelenskyy's comments came in a Sunday address to the nation after shocking reports and images emerged of mass civilian casualties in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv that was retaken by Ukrainian forces last week. In his speech, Zelenskyy accused Russia of ""genocide"" and singled out Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president of France, for their roles in a 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest, Romania. ""Under optimistic diplomatic statements that Ukraine could become a member of NATO, then, in 2008, refusal to accept Ukraine into the alliance was hidden. The absurd fear of some politicians toward Russia was hidden,"" Zelenskyy said. ""They thought that by refusing Ukraine, they would be able to appease Russia, to convince it to respect Ukraine and live normally next to us."" He added later: ""I invite Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy to visit Bucha and see what the policy of concessions to Russia has led to in 14 years. To see with their own eyes the tortured Ukrainian men and women."" During the 2008 summit, NATO leaders discussed requests by Ukraine and Georgia to join the Membership Action Plan, which is required for any country that wants to qualify for NATO membership. While then-US President George W. Bush pressed for both countries to be given the MAP, Germany and France argued that such a step would increase friction with Russia, which had strongly opposed Ukraine's request. In the end, the alliance did not take any immediate action but pledged that Ukraine and Georgia would eventually become NATO members, according to an official summary of the talks. They reiterated this promise at another NATO summit in Brussels in July. Russia has continued opposing NATO's eastward expansion and cited it as a reason for invading Ukraine. Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. Last month Zelenskyy said he had accepted that his country could not join NATO at the moment, telling Western officials: ""It is clear that Ukraine is not a member of NATO. We understand that.""

4/6/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) - Military conscripts in the Russian-backed Donbas region have been sent into front-line combat against Ukrainian troops with no training, little food and water, and inadequate weapons, six people in the separatist province told Reuters. The new accounts of untrained and ill-equipped conscripts being deployed are a fresh indication of how stretched the military resources at the Kremlin's disposal are, over a month into a war that has seen Moscow's forces hobbled by logistical problems and held up by fierce Ukrainian resistance. One of the people, a student conscripted in late February, said a fellow fighter told him to prepare to repel a close-quarter attack by Ukrainian forces in southwest Donbas but ""I don't even know how to fire an automatic weapon."" The student and his unit fired back and evaded capture, but he was injured in a later battle. He did not say when the fighting took place. While some information indicating poor conditions and morale among Donbas conscripts has emerged in social media and some local media outlets, Reuters was able to assemble one of the most comprehensive pictures to date. Besides the student draftee, Reuters spoke to three wives of conscripts who have mobile phone contact with their partners, one acquaintance of a draftee, and one source close to the pro-Russian separatist leadership who is helping to organize supplies for the Donbas armed forces. Reuters verified the identity of the student, as well as the other sources and the draftees they are associated with. The news agency was unable to confirm independently the accounts of what happened to the men once they were drafted. The six sources all asked that their full names not be published, saying that they feared reprisals for speaking to foreign media. The Donbas armed forces are fighting alongside Russian soldiers but are not part of the Russian armed forces, which have different rules about which troops they send into combat. Several Donbas draftees have been issued with a rifle called a Mosin, which was developed in the late 19th century and went out of production decades ago, according to three people who saw conscripts from the separatist region using the weapon. Images shared on social media, that Reuters has not been able to verify independently, also showed Donbas fighters with Mosin rifles. The student said he was forced to drink water from a fetid pond because of lack of supplies. Two other sources in contact with draftees also told Reuters the men had to drink untreated water. Some Donbas conscripts were given the highly dangerous mission of drawing enemy fire onto themselves so other units could identify the Ukrainian positions and bomb them, according to one of the sources and video testimony from a prisoner of war published by Ukrainian forces. Asked to comment about the treatment and low morale of the Donbass draftees, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was a question for the Donetsk People's Republic (DNR), the self-proclaimed separatist entity in Donbas. The Russian defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the DNR administration, after viewing Reuters questions, said there would be no response on Friday. She did not say when the administration would reply. Messages left with a spokesman for the separatist military went unanswered. After being pushed to the front line near the port of Mariupol — scene of the heaviest fighting in the war — a group of about 135 Donbas conscripts laid down their arms and refused to fight on, according to Veronika, the partner of a conscript, who said her husband was among them. Marina, partner of another conscript, said she had been in contact with a friend who was part of the same group. ""We're refusing (to fight),"" the friend wrote in a text message to Marina, seen by Reuters. The men were kept in a basement by military commanders as punishment, Veronika and Marina said. Commanders verbally threatened them with reprisals but subsequently allowed the group out of the basement, pulled them back from the front line and billeted them in abandoned homes, Veronika said. Neither the Kremlin nor separatist authorities answered Reuters questions about the incident. CALL-UP All sides in the Ukraine war have systems of conscription, where young men are required by law to do military service. Ukraine's government has declared a general mobilisation, meaning that conscripts and reservists have been deployed to fight. Russia says it is not deploying conscripts in Ukraine, though it has acknowledged a small number were mistakenly sent to fight. The Donetsk separatist authorities announced in late February they were drafting all fighting age men for immediate deployment. Military recruitment officers appeared at workplaces around the Donetsk region and told employees to report for duty, while police ordered people in the streets to report to their local draft office, according to a Reuters reporter who was there in late February. Anyone not complying risks prosecution. Reuters could not determine how many people have been called up, nor what proportion of Donbas forces is comprised of draftees. None of the five draftees had prior military experience or training, and four of the five were given no training before they were sent into combat, according to the injured draftee, the three wives of conscripted men, and the acquaintance. ""He never served in the army,"" said one of the partners, who gave her name as Olga and lives in the town of Makeevka. ""He doesn't even really know how to hold an automatic weapon."" Two of the wives said their partners were deployed to the front line, where they saw heavy fighting. ""I'm in the war,"" read a text message, seen by Reuters, that Marina, also from Makeevka, said came from her drafted husband. Marina said she learned from messages from her husband that his unit, fighting in the Donbas region, was ordered to draw enemy fire on to themselves. Ukrainian forces on March 12 published a video showing a prisoner of war. He said his name was Ruslan Khalilov, that he was a civil servant from Donbas and that he was sent with zero training to Mariupol where his role was to draw enemy fire to facilitate the bombing of Ukrainian targets. A person in Donbas who knows Khalilov confirmed to Reuters his identity, that he was drafted and has no military training. Reuters established that the person knows Khalilov. ""SLAUGHTERHOUSE"" The student draftee who spoke to Reuters said that a day after reporting for duty he was put in a mortar unit then sent towards the fighting. ""We were taught nothing,"" he wrote to Reuters via messenger app. ""Up to that point I had only seen mortars in movies. Obviously, I didn't know how to do anything with them."" He said that before he left, his unit had been under repeated attack by Ukrainian troops. ""There were lots of casualties,"" he wrote. ""I hate the war. I don't want it, curse it. Why are they sending me into a slaughterhouse?"" All the accounts gathered by Reuters mentioned an acute shortage of supplies. The sources described little or no safe drinking water, field rations for one man being shared among several, and units having to scavenge food. ""We drank water with dead frogs in it,"" said the student conscript. ""Supplies for the soldiers right now are a disaster,"" said the source close to the Donetsk separatist leadership, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Neither the Kremlin nor the separatist authorities replied to Reuters’ questions about supplies and equipment for the draftees from Donbas. WORLD WAR TWO RIFLE The same source said some conscripts were issued with the Mosin rifle from reserve stocks that date back to the Second World War. The student conscript said he has seen fellow fighters using the rifle: ""It's like we're fighting with World War Two muskets."" A soldier in the Russian armed forces who is fighting near Mariupol told Reuters he had seen soldiers from the Donetsk separatist military carrying Mosin rifles. A video posted on social media on Tuesday by Russian military journalist Semyon Pegov showed a man who said he was a Donbas draftee brandishing a Mosin rifle. Soon after the men were drafted in late February, many of their wives, mothers, and sisters started writing petitions to the separatist leadership, to Donbas draft offices, and to the Kremlin, describing their treatment and seeking help. ""Bring us back our men,"" said one petition addressed to Russian President Vladimir Putin, seen by Reuters. The three wives of draftees who spoke to Reuters said they received no definitive answers. On March 11, about 100 women gathered outside the separatist administration’s offices in Donetsk to demand answers, in a rare public show of dissent. Two women who took part in the gathering said Alexander Malkovsky, the head of the DNR draft office, came out and told them that men aged 18 to 27 would be exempted from the draft. Reuters couldn't determine if this has been implemented, and was unable to reach Malkovsky. Two of the conscripts' wives said that since the gathering they learned from their partners that conditions had improved: some units were pulled back from the front line and allowed to sleep in abandoned homes, instead of in trenches.

4/6/2022,"Rep. Matt Gaetz justified his vote against a bill that would cap insulin at $35 a month for most Americans by suggesting people with diabetes should first lose weight before Congress steps in to help. The Florida Republican claimed on Twitter on Thursday and in his newsletter a day later that obese people, not pharmaceutical companies, are running up the drug's price, writing that insulin's cost ""increases as waistlines increase."" ""While Democrat posturing of H.R. 6833 victimizes insulin payees as people with an uncontrollable disease that are being taken advantage of and need Big Brother to throw them a raft, lifestyle changes en masse would expeditiously lower demand and the subsequent prices of insulin,” Gaetz wrote. Though the bill to limit the cost of insulin was Democrat-sponsored, it passed the House on Thursday with bipartisan support. Twelve Republicans broke party ranks and voted with Democrats. Gaetz was one of 193 House Republicans to vote against the bill. About one in 10 Americans suffer from diabetes, and more than one in three have pre-diabetes, the Centers for Disease Control says. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the body is unable to create insulin, requiring it to be taken to survive. With type 2 diabetes, the body doesn't use insulin well. It's caused by several factors. Insulin costs have sharply increased over the last decade, with some insulin users spending upward of $2,000 a month on the drug. About one in four Americans reported rationing insulin to save money. New tech: FDA clears first app for iPhone and Android phones to deliver insulin doses for diabetics Among Americans who take insulin, about one in five would save money under the proposal, a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis says. In his newsletter, Gaetz cites a CDC statistic that 90-95% of people with diabetes in the U.S. have type 2, which the agency says “can be prevented or delayed with healthy lifestyle changes."" “Arbitrary price controls are no substitute for individual weight control,"" he said. ""Since 2000, the number of diabetes cases in the U.S. has nearly doubled. The demand for insulin has increased and the requisite price increase has followed suit. In other words, the price of insulin increases as waistlines increase.” While type 2 diabetes is tied to obesity and physical activity, it's also tied to a number of other causes like insulin resistance, genetics, family history, genetic mutations, hormonal diseases, certain medicines and damage to the pancreas, according to the National Institutes of Health. Type 1 is likely caused by genetics and environmental factors, like viruses that might trigger the disease, the NIH says. In Florida, which Gaetz represents, about 28% of people are obese and about 36% are overweight, according to the state's health department. About 13.1% of Floridians, or 2.4 million people, have diabetes, according to the Florida Diabetes Alliance. The bill will need to attract at least 10 Republican votes in the Senate to overcome a filibuster and become law.

4/6/2022,"A California city is planning to give universal basic income (UBI) to transgender and nonbinary residents regardless of their earnings level. Transgender residents in Palm Springs, California are eligible to receive a UBI of up to $900 per month solely for identifying as transgender or nonbinary — no strings attached. The new pilot program will have $200,000 set aside for allocation after a unanimous vote by the Palm Springs City Council last week. CAMILA ALVES MCCONAUGHEY REFLECTS ON RAISING HER FAMILY IN TEXAS: ‘IT REALLY EMBODIES OUR BELIEF SYSTEM’ Former San Diego City Councilman Carl DeMaio, a Republican who served as the first openly gay member of the city council, called the program ""outrageous and discriminatory."" ""We're completely opposed to guaranteed or universal basic income programs, because they ultimately cause inflation and raise the cost of living on everyone — they don't work,"" DeMaio said in a statement. ""But at least some of them have minimum income requirements to qualify, whereas this one is no-strings-attached 'woke' virtue signaling to the LGBT community in a way that is not only offensive but discriminatory,"" he continued. Twenty transgender and nonbinary Palm Springs residents will receive the free money funded by the taxpayers for 18 months, with advocacy-based health center DAP Health and LGBT advocacy group Queer Works managing the program. A six-month design period will be the precursor of the program’s implementation, in which the group Mayors for a Guaranteed Income will be involved providing guidance. DAP Health CEO David Brinkman claimed to reporters that the transgendered population is ""one of the most marginalized populations in our city who face some of the highest levels of housing insecurity, joblessness and discrimination."" Queer Works CEO Jacob Rostowsky also claimed in a press release that transgender and nonbinary people ""are highly marginalized in our society in general, especially economically,"" and told the Desert Sun that the city of Palm Springs would have to match any state funds. ""Our project's budget is estimated at about $1.8 million,"" Rostowsky said. ""And so when we look at what other [programs] that have been successfully funded have done, their local cities have provided nearly a match to that funding."" Palm Springs Mayor Lisa Middleton, who is transgender, pointed to the transcript from the city council's March 24 meeting where she ""expressed strong reservations in general to guaranteed income programs."" ""I specifically stated that I did not believe such programs could scale up to adequately respond to the over 37 million Americans living below the poverty line, the over 6 million Californians or the over 400,000 in the County of Riverside living below the poverty [line],"" Middleton said in an email, praising Brinkman for his work and expressing her ""concern for the financial vulnerability of the transgender community."" ""Transgender Americans suffer extremely high rates of under and unemployment. Transgender Americans face enormous challenges living full and authentic lives,"" the mayor said. ""Those challenges have increased substantially in the past few years as transgender children and their families have been targeted by extremist legislators and governors."" Middleton added she believes a UBI program is a ""county, state and federal responsibility,"" not a ""municipal"" one. ""My vote to affirm that evening was procedural to provide $200,000 to DAP in order to help them in the application for state funding. In advance of the vote I specifically stated my belief that guaranteed income programs were not the long-term way to proceed. I did not commit to any future funding of guaranteed income programs.""

4/6/2022,"WASHINGTON — Ukrainian society must be “cleansed of Nazi elements,” a leading Russian intellectual wrote in an essay published on Sunday, as Ukrainian soldiers sifted through the gruesome aftermath of a slaughter of civilians in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha. The article, titled “What Should Russia Do With Ukraine?” was published on the website of RIA Novosti, a news agency controlled by the Kremlin. Its author, Timofey Sergeytsev, is described as a “political technologist.” He previously worked for Viktor Yanukovych, the pro-Kremlin president of Ukraine ousted during the 2014 popular protests known as the Orange Revolution. Faithfully echoing the arguments that have been proffered by Russian President Vladimir Putin, Sergeytsev even puts the blame on the civilian population. “A significant number of common people are also guilty of being passive Nazis and Nazi accomplices,” Sergeytsev writes. “They supported the Nazi authorities and pandered to them.” Sergeytsev has made “outlandish, outrageous claims in the past,” Oxford expert on Russian affairs Samuel Ramani told Yahoo News. But in this case, the article “represents mainstream Kremlin thinking.” Ukrainian activists translated the article into English after the Russian-language version was circulated widely on social media. “This is what real #Russia wants,” the activists wrote. “As naked an endorsement of genocide as you’ll read in a state-owned media organ,” wrote Russia expert Michael Weiss on Twitter about the Sergeytsev article. The article amounts to a “genocide masterplan,” Berlin-based Russia expert Sergej Sumlenny told Yahoo News in a text message. He predicted that Sergeytsev’s musings would be used as justification for more atrocities like the one at Bucha. Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine in February under the fictitious pretenses that the nation’s leadership was rife with “Nazi” extremists. Although there are far-right elements in Ukraine’s society, and its military, they constitute an out-of-power fringe, as they do in other European states. Russia’s claims are rendered especially absurd given the fact that Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, is one of the few Jewish leaders on the world stage. Zelensky and some of his predecessors have sought to orient the nation away from Russia, toward the West, thus incurring the Kremlin’s ire. Russia is “not just after piecemeal annexation of territory,” Ramani told Yahoo News of Sergeytsev’s lengthy musings. “It’s about suppressing the Ukrainian identity, and it equates any kind of expression of Ukrainian nationalism with Nazism,” even when those expressions of national feeling are being voiced by Zelensky, who had family members who fought against the Nazis in World War II — and others who perished in the Holocaust. In his RIA Novosti article, Sergeytsev essentially calls for the elimination of Ukrainian national identity. “The name ‘Ukraine’ cannot be kept as a title of any fully denazified state entity on the territory liberated from the Nazi regime,” he writes. “The people’s republics, newly created on the territories free from Nazism, must and will develop on the basis of practices of economic self-government and social security, restoration and modernization of systems of essential services for the population.” Zelensky addressed the article in a call with Romanian politicians on Monday, saying it would be used as “evidence in a future tribunal of Russian war crimes.” He said the article called for “the annihilation of everything that makes Ukrainians Ukrainian.” Putin has long seen Ukraine as part of a broader, Moscow-led Slavic empire, a vision articulated by intellectuals who have provided a philosophical backing for the Kremlin’s aggressive aims in Ukraine and elsewhere. Although Ukrainians share cultural, religious and linguistic similarities with Russia, they have long bristled at being treated like a junior partner. Ukraine has been its own nation since the dissolution of the Soviet empire in 1991. Sergeytsev’s article is a window into how the Kremlin apparently continues to see the Ukraine invasion, despite seemingly abandoning its “denazification” project last week amid mounting military losses. Regime change is no longer a public Russian condition for peace. But whether the Kremlin truly seeks an end to fighting remains unclear. For one, the Kremlin continues to promote its unfounded claims of Ukrainian extremism, with former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev writing in a Monday social media post that “a passionate segment of Ukrainian society has been praying to the Third Reich for the last 30 years. Literally.” Going even further in his RIA Novosti essay, Sergeytsev argues that “Ukra-nazism poses a much bigger threat to the world and Russia than the Hitler version of German Nazism.” Russian media has been full of lurid stories about the supposed slaughter of ethnic Russians by Ukrainian troops. Outlandish conspiracy theories about bioweapons laboratories funded by Hunter Biden, the president’s son, and George Soros, the Jewish philanthropist, have also proliferated widely in Russian media — and without any evident skepticism. Adolf Hitler was responsible for the deaths of millions of Russians and Ukrainians, as well as the extermination of 6 million Jews. Russian propaganda has latched on to the fact that there were also Ukrainian collaborators who worked with the Nazis during Hitler’s invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Those Ukrainian nationalists hoped to secure independence from the brutal Soviet rule, which was itself responsible for millions of deaths in Ukraine. Zelensky and his supporters argue that if any regime represents modern-day Nazi Germany, it is the one found in Moscow. “It’s important to spread this article,” the Ukrainians who posted the English-language version of Sergeytsev’s essay wrote. “The world should be aware of Russian methods, crimes, and plans. Putin will not stop until he is stopped.” _____",World/Yahoo News,'Genocide masterplan': Experts alarmed after Kremlin intellectual calls for 'cleansed' Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/genocide-masterplan-experts-alarmed-after-kremlin-intellectual-calls-for-cleansed-ukraine-182354392.html
4/6/2022,"WASHINGTON — The Air Force and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency quietly conducted a successful hypersonic missile test last month. A defense official told Defense News the Pentagon chose not to announce the test of the Hypersonic Air-breathing Weapon Concept, or HAWC, for about two weeks to avoid inflaming already-delicate tensions with Russia. The free-flight test involved the version of the HAWC created by Lockheed Martin and Aerojet Rocketdyne and was released from a B-52 Stratofortress off the West Coast in mid-March, the defense official said. A DARPA release Tuesday said the HAWC missile was boosted until its air-breathing, Aerojet-made scramjet engine ignited and quickly accelerated to speeds faster than Mach 5. DARPA said it maintained that speed for an extended period of time, reached altitudes higher than 65,000 feet, and flew for more 300 nautical miles. Details of the test and the reason it was not immediately announced were first reported by CNN. The defense official said the HAWC test took place shortly after Russia said it used one of its own hypersonic weapons against Ukraine and was the same week as President Joe Biden’s trip to Europe, which began March 23. He compared the Pentagon’s decision not to immediately reveal the test to its decision to postpone a Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile test in early March. That ICBM test was delayed after Russian President Vladimir Putin put his nation’s nuclear forces on higher alert, and the Pentagon said it wanted to avoid any possible misunderstanding over the Minuteman test. Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters, head of U.S. European Command, confirmed in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing last week Russia had launched several hypersonic weapons against targets in Ukraine. DARPA said the March test marked the second successful flight for the HAWC, following a September 2021 test of Raytheon Technologies’ version of the missile. Andrew Knoedler, the HAWC program manager in DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office, said the program is now analyzing data from the flight test. “This Lockheed Martin HAWC flight test successfully demonstrated a second design that will allow our warfighters to competitively select the right capabilities to dominate the battlefield,” Knoedler said. “These achievements increase the level of technical maturity for transitioning HAWC to a service program of record.” Hypersonic weapons can travel at tremendous speeds, more than five times the speed of sound, and are highly maneuverable. Because they are able to change course midflight, they are much harder to track and shoot down than conventional ballistic missiles, making them capable of penetrating enemy defenses. The successful test gives Air Force hypersonics a win after a string of setbacks. The Air Force’s main hypersonic program, the AGM-183A Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon, or ARRW, saw testing failures and delays in 2021 that prompted Congress to strike nearly $161 million in procurement funds in the 2022 spending bill and divert half of that amount to research and development. The Air Force’s proposed fiscal 2023 budget seeks to increase funding for hypersonic prototyping, but doesn’t call for any procurement funds next year.",World/Defense News,Pentagon kept hypersonic test quiet amid Russia tensions,https://news.yahoo.com/pentagon-kept-hypersonic-test-quiet-152411321.html
4/6/2022,"Ecologists with the U.S. Geological Survey collected first-of-its-kind photographic evidence last year of a bobcat devouring python eggs in the Big Cypress National Preserve. Driving the news: The finding, published last month in the journal Ecology and Evolution, suggests there's finally hope that a predator could halt the python's creeping dominance — by eating its eggs. Stay on top of the latest market trends and economic insights with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free What they're saying: ""This is the first documentation of any animal in Florida preying on python eggs, and the first evidence or description of such antagonistic interactions at a python nest,"" the authors wrote. Why it matters: Tens of thousands of invasive Burmese pythons are spread over more than 1,000 square miles of South Florida and compete with native wildlife for food, causing severe population declines in Everglades National Park and Big Cypress. Raccoons, opossums and bobcats have greatly declined since 1997. Marsh rabbits, cottontail rabbits and foxes effectively disappeared. What happened: Ecologists trained a camera trap on a python nest to observe reproductive biology, but the camera caught a bobcat arriving to snack. The cat came back three times that night, then returned the next morning to bury extra eggs in the ground. The next day the camera caught the cat and snake in a fight. Yes, but: It's possible that this interaction was an isolated incident. Though it could also be possible that native species are beginning to respond to the presence of the python, and this could be a learned behavior that starts to happen regularly, the New York Times reports.

4/6/2022,"(Reuters) - Russia's foreign ministry said it would reiterate its request for the U.N. Security Council to meet on Monday over what Moscow called the ""criminal provocations by Ukrainian soldiers and radicals"" in the town of Bucha near Kyiv. Britain's mission to the United Nations, which holds the presidency of the 15-member council for April, had said the Council would hold a scheduled discussion on Ukraine on Tuesday, and not meet on Monday as requested by Russia. ""Today Russia will again demand that the U.N. Security Council convene in connection with the criminal provocations of Ukrainian servicemen and radicals in this city,"" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova wrote on her Telegram channel. Ukrainian authorities said on Sunday they were investigating possible war crimes by Russia after finding hundreds of bodies strewn around towns outside the capital Kyiv following Russian troops' withdrawal from the area. The Russian defence ministry said the images distributed by Ukraine were ""another staged performance by the Kyiv regime"", and Russia's chief investigator on Monday ordered a probe on the basis that Ukraine had spread ""deliberately false information"" about Russian armed forces in Bucha. Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.
