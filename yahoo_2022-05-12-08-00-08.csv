5/12/2022,"Saturday was a bad weather day to remember for one couple: A lightning bolt came perilously close to their Florida home. A Ring security camera caught the terrifying seconds after the bolt hits a tree across the street, explodes, then causes a raging fire. Woah!

Check out this lighting strike caught on camera in Sebring, Florida: pic.twitter.com/N4rA445Szb — The Weather Channel (@weatherchannel) May 10, 2022 Rodney Murphy, who was reportedly out in his yard just about 75 feet away from the blast in Sebring in Highlands County, is seen clenching his body, waiting for impact. Amazingly, he escaped with no injuries; even he was surprised. “It was so bright,” Murphy told News Channel 8. “That’s why I thought I was hit.” “What I heard was like a bomb had been dropped,” added wife Denice Murphy who said her husband’s new nickname is “Lightning Rod.” “The house shook, and the bed.” If there is lightning in your area, and you are not near a safe structure, the CDC recommends you crouch down and curl yourself into a ball, with your head tucked in, with minimal contact to the ground. Never take shelter under a tree and stay away from all bodies of water and all elevated ground.

5/12/2022,"Whether you’re the queen of England or a newborn baby, everyone pees. The average person flushes five to six times a day, but urine is not something most people typically keep a close eye on — unless they suddenly notice an unusual color in the toilet. Despite what you might have heard, clear urine is not the only hallmark of good health. A range of colors is acceptable. Urine is made up of excess water, electrolyte salts and other waste. The kidneys produce urine, which finds its way into the bladder and is later excreted. The bladder fills up, and eventually reaches a point when it can’t hold anymore, which causes the sensation that informs you that you must make a visit to the bathroom. This process is necessary because it’s harmful to have too much water in your system. Dr. Mark Ellerkmann, director of the Center for Urogynecology at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore, tells Yahoo Life that toxins in the body and bloodstream need to be eliminated. As the kidneys filter the blood, they remove toxins and extra water to make urine. Of course, if your pee is coming out a blood orange color, it’s normal to be concerned. Some health conditions can change the color of urine. Fortunately, experts say, there are also many nonmedical reasons for such changes. Ellerkmann says that the shade can depend on urine concentration, which influences a natural pigment called urochrome. When the urine is more concentrated (with less water and more waste product), it’s darker. When you’re hydrated, the urine is less concentrated and you have a clear or light color. Other things, for example, your medication, your diet and any infections you may experience, can cause the urine to change color. “Your color can vary depending on your hydration status. Any transient changes in urine color should not alarm you,” Ellerkmann says. The color of your urine can serve as a window to your health. If your urine is yellow… If you’re well-hydrated, your urine will probably be a clear or light yellow. Ellerkmann explains that this has to do with maintaining a balance of fluids as the kidneys eliminate excess fluid in the body. “We don’t want to become dehydrated, but we also don’t want to become over-hydrated,” he says. “This whole concept of homeostasis and fluid management is something the kidneys handle.” When a person is getting enough water, the kidney flushes out the excess, leaving a clear, lighter color. With dehydration, the kidney holds on to the fluids, and the urine is darker. “Generally, I tell patients to drink enough water to keep their urine light yellow, but that amount can be different for everybody,” Dr. Jason Kim, associate professor of urology at the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University and director of the Women's Pelvic Health and Continence Center at Stony Brook Medicine, tells Yahoo Life. If your urine is orange… One of the most common explanations for orange urine is medication. Kim explains that pyridium is frequently prescribed for urinary tract infections (UTIs), and that one of its side effects is that it turns urine a reddish-orange. This is a sign that the medicine is doing its job, and the color will go away once you stop taking the medication. Some laxatives and certain chemotherapy drugs have the same effect. Kim says taking high amounts of vitamin also produce a bright yellow or orange urine. These vitamins, such as riboflavin, are water-soluble and not completely absorbed by the body. When there is too much vitamin B, the kidneys filter and remove the excess, resulting in a lot of bright yellow to orange urine. Another nutrient responsible for orange urine is beta carotene, the pigment that gives carrots its orange color. If your urine has a blue or green tint… Kim says medications including some anesthetics, such as propofol, have occasionally turned urine blue. For those undergoing a procedure or medical intervention, doctors can sometimes use certain dyes that can make the urine look blue. Eating foods with strong food coloring dyes can also cause urine to turn a shade of blue or green. If your urine is brown… If you're dehydrated, your urine may have a brown hue to it. Kim says dark brown urine indicates you're not drinking enough fluids, because your urine is too concentrated. But if you’re chugging water regularly, Ellerkmann says one reason for brown urine is that you’ve recently eaten some blackberries. If that’s the case, he says the urine color change is harmless and probably means you have just eaten a lot of the fruit in a short time. However, according to the Mayo Clinic, some liver and kidney disorders, as well as some urinary tract infections, can turn urine dark brown and warrant a doctor’s visit. If your urine is cloudy… Cloudy urine and a burning sensation or difficulty urinating can be a sign of a urinary tract infection. Kim says it’s important to see your doctor for a workup and get the right antibiotics for quick relief. If your urine is dark or red… While reddish pee can be due to eating certain types of produce — “some vegetables with vitamin B, rhubarb or beets can cause red urine,” notes Kim — a dark hue may represent blood in the urine, also called hematuria. Ellerkmann says this can be caused by several conditions involving the bladder and kidneys. “If it has more of a coffee grounds appearance, that would be very concerning,” he says. It can be a sign of blood in the urine from kidney stones, kidney cancer or bladder cancer. One indicator that dark urine is from blood, says Ellerkmann, is if it continues to show up for several days. “Persistent bright-red blood, bloody urine or very dark-colored urine should be evaluated,” he says. Blood in the urine is never normal and can signal a serious medical condition that should alert you to see your health care provider or a urologist immediately. A range of health problems involves blood in the urine, including: Kidney stones Cancer Urinary tract infection Kidney disease Bladder disease “The American Medical Association recommends a workup if there's blood in the urine, and this would include specialized urine tests, along with some sort of imaging tests such as a CAT [computerized tomography] scan and a cystoscopy,” Kim explains. The majority of Americans are full of it, according to new research. Seven in 10 Americans are holding their poop in all to avoid using a public restroom. A new survey of 2,000 general population Americans asked about their pooping preferences and found 69% hate pooping in public so much, they hold it in until they can be in the comfort of their own home.Men were also more likely to agree with this mindset, at 74% compared to 65% of women surveyed.On average, Americans are holding it in for two and half hours in order to poop at home – and men are willing to wait three hours, compared to two hours for women.Why are people putting themselves through this discomfort? The survey found 64% of respondents agreed they’re just uncomfortable with using a public restroom for No. 2.Conducted by OnePoll on behalf of MiraLAX, the survey asked respondents what the most important points of public restroom etiquette are and found peeping through the gaps in the doors is the biggest violation (48%).Forty-six percent of those surveyed who are uncomfortable with using a public restroom shared it’s because they don’t want anyone hearing them do their business.An additional 44% said they’re uncomfortable pooping in a strange or unknown environment and three in 10 are a little pee shy, citing they don’t like going to the bathroom around other people.The survey also delved into the role pooping plays in the workplace – and the separate set of anxieties that come with the territory. As many Americans return to the office for the first time in months, one in five American office workers cited having to use the office bathroom as a prime reason they are stressed about the return to the office amid the pandemic.Of those surveyed who are employed (approximately 1,300 respondents), 71% agreed they have a special bathroom they specifically use for #2 at work.Moreover, 66% of American workers admit to holding it in to avoid using their workplace restroom. As a result, this has caused a staggering 64% of workers to become constipated.As more and more workers return to their offices and are forced to revisit pre-pandemic bathroom habits, workstipation, the stress associated with “going” at the office resulting in a backed-up gut, is likely to rear its ugly head,” said David Ball, General Manager and Vice President Marketing – Digestive Health at Bayer. “With so many workplace bathrooms considered uncomfortable, it is important Americans are armed with effective solutions when constipation arises to aid in helping them go comfortably.”Aside from the toilet paper and bad smells, other workplace bathroom pet peeves for employed respondents included coworkers trying to talk to them while they’re in a stall (36%) and witnessing co-workers walk out without washing their hands (31%).Seven in 10 employed respondents shared they feel self-conscious about pooping at work – with the top reasons including fearing they use the restroom longer than others (50%) and, in turn, having their co-workers judge them for taking too long (40%).“Americans deserve to feel comfortable when it comes to pooping at work, in spite of the many reasons workplace bathrooms can be a less-than-ideal experience, as avoiding going can cause much discomfort,” Ball continued. PUBLIC RESTROOM ETIQUETTEDon’t look through gaps in the doors - 48%Don’t talk, especially to someone who’s urinating/defecating - 46%Keep one stall/urinal between you and the next person - 40%Avoid making unnecessary noises - 39%Avoid eye contact - 32%Leave as quickly as possible - 32%Avoid making or taking phone calls - 32%TOP WORKPLACE BATHROOM PET PEEVESThin toilet paper - 44%Bad smells - 43%Gaps in bathroom stalls - 37%Coworkers trying to speak to you while you are in a stall - 36%Hearing sounds coming from other stalls - 34%Coworkers that don’t wash their hands - 31%When coworkers are in the bathroom and you need to poop - 22%Coworkers gathering and talking - 12% Want lifestyle and wellness news delivered to your inbox?

5/12/2022,"The $13 billion aircraft carrier USS Gerald R Ford is a first-in-class ship and features a suite of new technologies. Former President Donald Trump complained about the ""look"" of the aircraft on numerous occasions, according to his former defense secretary. After cost overruns and delays, the Ford is expected to be ready for naval operations later this year. Former President Donald Trump liked to complain about ""ugly"" ships, and the US Navy's new aircraft carrier, USS Gerald R Ford, was often the target of his criticisms, according to former officials, including his former defense secretary. The $13 billion Ford is a first-in-class ship and is the world's largest aircraft carrier. It features a collection of new technologies, such as advanced weapons elevators, advanced arresting gear, and a electromagnetic aircraft launch system, among other upgrades over the Navy's older Nimitz-class carriers. The former president complained often, both publicly and in private, about the viability of these new systems, insisting that the elevators would stop working if they got a drop of water on them or that the new catapults were too complex compared to the older steam catapults and required Einstein-level intelligence to operate. He thought the ship would ""never work,"" former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper wrote in his new book, ""A Sacred Oath: Memoirs of a Secretary of Defense During Extraordinary Times."" But above all, Esper wrote, Trump was consistently fixated on ""the look"" of the ship, different angles of which can be seen in the following US Navy photos. Esper recalled visiting Norfolk, Virginia with Trump toward the end of his presidency to see off the USNS Comfort. As the former president admired the destroyers and other warships at the pier, he remarked ""how beautiful"" they looked before launching into a tirade complaining about the Ford. ""I had tried multiple times in the past to address these matters, but by now had given up,"" the former Pentagon chief reported. Trump took particular issue with the position of the Ford's command center for flight operations and the ship overall, a structure commonly known as the ""island."" The island is a narrow structure that extends upward from the flight deck. The island ""looks really bad — it's stupid,"" Trump said, according to Esper, adding that the president suggested moving the command center closer to the middle of the ship. ""Imagine the time and cost to do that,"" Esper wrote in his memoir. Esper explained that Trump ""would gesture with his hands, parallel to each other, farther apart, then closer,"" when discussing the island, ""like a football referee measuring the distance in inches or feet to get a first down."" The Ford's design was the product of years of effort. Navy officers tried to explain that the command center was placed there for operational purposes, specifically making it easier to conduct flight operations, but Trump insisted ""it doesn't look right,"" adding that he had ""an eye for aesthetics,"" according to the book ""Peril"" by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Robert Costa that came out last year. When Trump said he had an ""eye for aesthetics,"" he reportedly rubbed his hands through his own hair and told his audience, which included Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, ""Can't you tell?"" Despite setbacks over the course of the ship's development, the Ford has gone through explosive shock trials and the necessary maintenance availabilities and should be ready for naval operations sometime this year. Three other Ford-class carriers, the John F. Kennedy, the Enterprise, and the Doris Miller, are in the works.

5/12/2022,"Texas’ murky waterways hide massive beasts, but it takes a rod, fish heads, and a lot of fight to reveal them, video taken by a Houston-area angler shows. Payton Moore, a fisherman and YouTuber, could hardly see through the waves and wake when the alligator gar took his bait. At first he thinks he snagged a sunken tree, he says in a video recently posted on his YouTube channel, WILD LIFE. But then the thing on the hooks starts to wrestle with him. “We are on something enormous,” he says. The muddy river is somewhere “in the greater Houston area,” Moore told McClatchy News, but in the interest of protecting the fish, he declined to reveal anything more about his gar fishing spot. The strength pulling away from Moore hints at what creature he has on the hook. “It’s like walking a T-Rex,” he says. “Every time I think I’m going to muscle him up, he muscles me back down,” Moore says in the video. A rod won’t be enough, he decides. Moore readies a rope lasso as he pulls the gar closer to shore. The fight goes on and the beast breaches the surface. An “absolute dinosaur,” the angler says. While alligator gar might not be literal dinosaurs, they are an extremely old species that existed at the same time as dinosaurs, according to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. When the moment comes, Moore moves in close, loops the rope around the gar and pulls it in. On shore, he measures the fish at 8 feet, 2 inches long — 3 inches shy of the world record for length. Moore didn’t get the chance to weigh the fish before releasing it back into the river — so there’s no way to know how heavy it was for certain — but he estimates it was about 300 pounds. “This is by far the most amazing catch of my entire life and it’s not even close,” Moore says. “I could fish for the rest of my life and never see one like that again.” With measurements done, Moore carries the gar into the water and back to freedom, video shows. It thrashes out of his hands, easily knocking him over in the process. Catching and releasing is important, Moore wrote on his YouTube page, asking others to do the same, especially for gar. Despite their intimidating name and impressive set of teeth, alligator gar pose no danger to people, according to Texas wildlife experts, and there is no confirmed instance of a gar attacking a person. Their size and appearance make them a prized game fish, TPWD says. But the species has been declining and has even vanished from certain parts of the southern U.S., and overfishing is considered a large contributor. Fortunately however, “Texas populations are still strong,” experts say. With fossil records dating as far back as 215 million years, gar are “truly native Texans,” TPWD said. ‘Diet Coke was spewing everywhere’: Alligator crashes a pre-birthday party in Florida Angler reels in bass with parasitic surprise, Missouri photos show. ‘Lord have mercy’ ‘What the heck is this?’ Ice fisherman reels in rare ‘golden’ fish at Minnesota lake ‘Blue dragons’ appearing on Texas beaches don’t breathe fire, but be careful near them",U.S./Fort Worth Star-Telegram,"‘Like walking a T-Rex.’ Angler uses rod, lasso to reel in huge alligator gar in Texas",https://news.yahoo.com/walking-t-rex-angler-uses-213752282.html
