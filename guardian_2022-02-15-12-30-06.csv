2/15/2022,"The Myanmar military kidnapped civilians and forced them to work as human shields, attacked homes, churches and carried out massacres, according to a report that warns recent atrocities in eastern Myanmar may amount to war crimes. The report, by the Myanmar-founded human rights group Fortify Rights, documents abuses by the country’s military in Karenni state, also known as Kayah state, an area that has seen intense fighting between the army and groups opposed to last year’s military coup.  The military has faced strong resistance in Karenni state, and has responded with brutal violence in an attempt to crush opposition. The report includes claims that the army used civilians as human shields and as forced porters – allegations which have also been reported elsewhere in the country, including in Chin state.An 18-year-old student from Moe Bye township, located on the border between Karenni and Shan states, told interviewers that he was taken, along with his uncle and two other men, in early June 2021 and used as a human shield in clashes between the military and the local armed resistance. The group escaped after having been detained for four days, during which time they were tied up, blindfolded and tortured, the student said. Another interviewee alleged that he and nine others were captured by the military and forced to porter army equipment for five days. The Fortify Rights report, a flash report providing preliminary documentation, based on interviews with 30 people, including eyewitnesses and survivors, adds to growing evidence of military abuses. Numerous international organisations have raised concern over recent atrocities in Karenni, including the Christmas Eve massacre of at least 40 civilians, including a child and two humanitarians working with Save the Children, near the village of Moso in Hpruso township. The victims were killed and burned. The Karenni Civil Society Network estimates that 170,000 civilians, more than half the state’s estimated population, have been displaced since the military seized power last year. UN estimates suggest about 91,900 have been forced to flee their homes. According to Fortify Rights, the military has targeted shelters for those who are displaced, including camps and churches, resulting in the deaths of civilians. In January, the military killed at least three people, including two children, when it bombed a camp for displaced people near the village of Ree Khee Bu in Hpruso. Banyar Khun Naung, director of the non-profit Karenni Human Rights Group, said there were no indications that violence would reduce in intensity and that he feared shortages of food and essential supplies would worsen over the coming months. “In Karenni we can see that our socio-economic condition has collapsed. Ordinary people, even if they are not [internally displaced people], even if they are the host community of IDPs, they can hardly survive. “We cannot grow rice, or vegetable, we cannot trade between township to township, the online banking system has failed,” he said. The supply of food and medicine to Karenni state was also being blocked by the military, he said. Statements by the UN expressing concern over the situation in Myanmar have had “no discernible effect” on the military junta, Fortify Rights said. The junta has also failed to honour a five point plan developed last year by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which calls for the “immediate cessation of violence” and a commitment for all parties to exercise “utmost restraint.” Asean, which has led diplomatic efforts to ease the crisis and will meet this week, should support the establishment of a UN security council-mandated global arms embargo, Ismail Wolff, regional director at Fortify Rights. “The Myanmar junta is murdering people with weapons procured on the global market, and that must stop,” said Wolff. “The UN security council must urgently impose a global arms embargo on the Myanmar military, and it would be strategic and sensible for Asean to support it.”",News/World news,"Myanmar military atrocities may amount to war crimes, says rights group",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/myanmar-military-atrocities-may-amount-to-war-crimes-says-rights-group
2/15/2022,"Thousands of nurses rallying outside New South Wales parliament have vowed to “come back bigger and angrier each time we are ignored” during the first statewide nurses strike in a decade on Tuesday. The healthcare professionals turned out in large numbers despite a ruling by the Industrial Relations Commission late on Monday that the strike should not go ahead.  Staff at around 150 public hospitals are participating in staggered strikes across the state on Tuesday, with a skeleton staff working to ensure patient safety. Nurses want ratios of one nurse to every four patients on every shift and a pay increase above the government’s prescribed public sector offer of 2.5%. A nurse of 15 years told the Guardian it had “taken a lot for us to walk off the job today” but it had reached a critical point and she felt like it was her only option. “The way it’s going, it’s unsustainable,” she said. “We just want to provide safe care to our patients.” An emergency department nurse from Wollongong, who has been working for two years, said he was already burnt out and considering changing careers. “We were thrown in the deep end and we’re totally burnt out,” he said. “We’re supposed to be working in one of the better healthcare systems in the world but at the moment it feels pretty piss-poor.” The NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association (NSWNMA) general secretary, Brett Holmes, accused the premier, Dominic Perrottet, of being out of touch “with the real world” and the reality of working though the Omicron wave in hospitals. Union assistant general secretary Shaye Candish read out stories from nurses detailing extreme cases of understaffing and burnout. “This government is under-resourcing the health system and it’s creating trauma for us,” she said. “It’s time for the premier to listen. [Nurses] are saying that the system’s not coping and it’s not OK. We are not going away until our demands are met. “We will come back bigger and angrier each time we are ignored.” Pressed on the issue of staffing ratios last week, Perrottet said it “hasn’t actually worked so well in other states”. But University of Queensland health executive dean, distinguished professor Patsy Yates, disagreed, pointing to a study she co-authored in the Lancet journal last year looking into the policy’s implementation in Queensland. The study concluded improvements in staffing due to the implantation of ratios saw mortality rates drop, better outcomes for patients and cost savings due to fewer readmissions. “The evidence is pretty clear that having a skilled, educated nursing workforce makes a difference to patient mortality, to other patient outcomes and it improves healthcare system efficiency,” Yates told the Guardian. “It is just such a logical thing to do to actually get better healthcare. “There’s a growing body of evidence across Europe, across the US, that demonstrates that this simple intervention can make a difference.” Yates said all governments should be looking carefully at the study and similar work from overseas to guard against further future staffing shortages. “We can’t afford not to pay attention to issues such as burnout and wellbeing amongst the workforce,” she said. “It doesn’t only make sense in terms of patient safety, it makes sense in terms of having a sustainable workforce going forward.” The NSW health minister, Brad Hazzard, met with the union on Monday in an attempt to avert the action and said he was disappointed the strike went ahead. “It’s unfortunate ... there’s been all sorts of efforts to try and work our way through their principal issues,” he told Sydney radio 2GB on Tuesday. But union officials speaking at the rally accused the government of being disingenuous in “crisis talks”. NSW Nurses and Midwives Association president O’Bray Smith said Hazzard and health bureaucrats spent the meeting “mansplain(ing) about life in health”. “Those ‘crisis talks’ were merely a tickbox so they could go to the IRC and the media and say ‘Oh, we tried’,” she said. “I will not be lectured about safe staffing by these men.” Hazzard agreed there needed to be enough nurses to ensure patients were safely cared for but said the union’s demands would cost around $1bn. “I still need to be able to manage taxpayers’ dollars and make sure it works,” he said.
