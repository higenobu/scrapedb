3/6/2022,"A late, late try by Tom de Glanville sealed an incredible comeback victory for Bath against 14-man Bristol in this pulsating Somerset derby. After the impressive lock, Ewan Richards, nearly crashed to the try-line at the death, as Bath hunted the winning score, the Bristol replacement Theo Strang was shown a yellow card for an early tackle. A decisive penalty try for the home team looked a strong possibility, which the referee Luke Pearce eventually decided against. Ultimately, Bath used their two-man advantage to create the necessary space for De Glanville to crash over and send the Recreation Ground crowd into raptures. At 21-0 to Bristol with 15 minutes gone, this had been shaping up to be the most sobering afternoon yet in a challenging campaign for Bath. But Siva Naulago’s first-half sending off – and Bath’s stirring fightback – transformed it into a thoroughly absorbing affair. With Wales’s Taulupe Faletau back from Six Nations duty and Sam Underhill also restored in the back row after illness there was every reason for Bath optimism. But their afternoon could hardly have started any worse: driving lineout mauls on either side of the field resulted in two pushover tries for the Bristol hooker, Harry Thacker, within six minutes. Naulago stole in at the right corner for the third try on 15 minutes, using his considerable strength to fight off a gaggle of covering defenders. Callum Sheedy curled an exquisite conversion from out wide to maximise the damage. After the full-back De Glanville wasted an overlap after being fed by Danny Cipriani, the hosts encamped themselves in Bristol’s 22 for a spell and although Thacker was sent to the sin bin for illegally slowing down the ball, Bath were soon being held up over the try-line, still scoreless. An almost laughably reckless tackle by Naulago on Will Butt, demonstrating his strength in more questionable fashion, soon had Bristol reduced to 13. Then it was about Bath making their temporary two-man advantage count – and Semesa Rokoduguni duly sped over in the corner. Sheedy made it four from four off the tee with a penalty on the stroke of half-time but Bath had something to cling to at 24-5 and being a man up. No sooner than Thacker returned from his time in the sin bin after half time, Sheedy was given 10 minutes off for a deliberate knock-on. Jonathan Joseph roared over after prompting by Cipriani and the deficit was reduced to 12. Cipriani converted, and another high-octane break by Bath saw Rokoduguni held up just short. The ball was recycled and Faletau powered over from short range, Cipriani added the extras, and Bath were back within five. A thrilling, end-to-end final quarter ensued in which both teams aimed for the knockout blow. With eight minutes left, when Rokoduguni fed Joe Cokanasiga in the corner, this time he finished with precision. Cipriani missed the conversion and that left it level at 24-24. A penalty by Sheedy looked to have won it at the last for Bristol, but Bath were not to be denied. Ewan Richards nearly barrelled to the line, and after a long TMO check, Strang was shown a yellow card. With the clock deep in the red, De Glanville sent the crowd wild.",Sport/Sport,De Glanville snatches dramatic late win for Bath over Bristol after Naulago red,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/05/bath-bristol-premiership-rugby-union-match-report
3/6/2022,"Gareth Southgate was at Molineux again with Max Kilman, one of Wolves’ best players this season, on the England manager’s radar. But on a day when Crystal Palace extended their unbeaten away record in 2022 to complete a deserved double over Bruno Lage’s side, this son of Russian and Ukrainian parents played an unwitting part in the goals from Jean-Philippe Mateta and Wilfried Zaha. The former England futsal international has been an ever-present in the Premier League, his calmness on the ball and reading of the game among his standout attributes, but he was unable to prevent Mateta giving Patrick Vieira’s side the lead and then conceded the penalty from which Zaha effectively sealed the game. Palace moved into the top half of the table, two places behind a Wolves side who fell to their third consecutive defeat. The left-footed Kilman, normally so assured playing to the right of Conor Coady, has fallen below his breakout standards in these defeats and, as Wolves switched to four at the back in a tactical switch, was withdrawn 11 minutes from time. Palace were as impressive as Wolves were shocking in the first half. The two goals were the least Vieira’s side deserved. To think that at the end of Wolves’ previous home game, a 2-1 win over Leicester City, they had the games in hand to be able to see a way into the top four but contrasting defeats in London had returned them to earth with a bump. With an FA Cup quarter-final home tie with Everton to look forward to after their midweek victory over Stoke City, Palace are a team on the up. Their unbeaten run on the road in 2022 has clearly given them the confidence to go at teams and Mateta could have scored even earlier, as he headed Michael Olise’s corner straight at José Sá. Jeffrey Schlupp was granted easy inroads down the inside-left channel, even before he earned a penalty, as Wolves again felt the loss of the injured Nélson Semedo. Down the other channel, Conor Gallagher also found space behind Wolves midfield and in between the wing-backs and centre-backs. Palace’s game plan was working a treat. So when Mateta won the header for Gallagher to play Wilfried Zaha in behind Conor Coady, it was no surprise when Palace’s talisman was able to take the ball to the byline and nick a tight ball back in for Mateta, who got in ahead of both Sá and Kilman, and then reacted most swiftly to turn the loose ball over the line. Kilman’s protection was not helped by an injury to Ki-Jana Hoever, who had to be replaced by Jonny, himself gradually returning from a second ACL knee injury, in the 25th minute. Palace were swarming all over Wolves at this stage, especially down the channels, and Schlupp went slaloming down the inside-right corridor again before he was tripped by Kilman. Zaha, who had missed a penalty against Norwich last month in comical fashion, converted his ninth Premier League goal of the season in style. Sa had to make two brilliant diving saves, from Gallagher when Kilman gave the ball away and from Olise’s dazzling left-foot curler, before Wolves rallied with four corners and a shot from Daniel Podence that Vicente Guaita turned behind. But it was too little too late. Palace were content to get men behind the ball in the second half and, though Wolves made some inroads, Hwang Hee-chan hesitated when played through by Daniel Podence from their best chance, and nor could Raúl Jiménez make much difference.",Sport/Football,Jean-Philippe Mateta and Wilfried Zaha give Crystal Palace fine win at Wolves,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/05/wolves-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report
3/6/2022,"This one lived up to the hype. Two teams with little time for entertaining the neutrals have made strong claims to being the best in the land by employing a brutal approach. The winner was never going to be the team with the more exhilarating Plan B. The spoils were always going to go to the outfit who could shift an immovable object with unstoppable force. Saracens edged it, avenging a stoppage-time loss in October with a 34-27 win over Leicester. In sideways rain and bitter cold, Marc McCall’s team sent a strong reminder that a year in the wilderness hadn’t blunted their title credentials. It was Leicester, though, who made the first move. A third consecutive lineout maul within sight of Saracens’ line yielded fruit when Nic Dolly at the back rumbled forward before Eli Snyman brushed off two defenders to score on seven minutes. Saracens needed just one go at their maul to dot down which they did on 20 minutes through Tom Woolstencroft. It’s a sight that has been replicated in each of Saracens’ last five matches: Woolstencroft lobs the ball in, a giant plucks it out of the air, the hooker joins his teammates and keeps his bind before he’s dragged over. That knocked Leicester on to the back foot. George Ford kicked a penalty but Saracens looked like scoring from every visit to the Tigers’ 22. Just before the hour mark Aled Davies had the feed to a scrum on the right. Nick Tompkins at first receiver located Alex Goode on the loop. The ball moved at pace to Elliot Daly and then to Alex Lewington who slid in the corner. Kini Murimurivalu’s late hit on Lewington on the floor earned him a yellow. After Alex Lozowski converted he shunted over a penalty from the halfway line, giving Saracens 10 points from a single play. A three-point deficit had morphed into a seven-point advantage. Ford reduced it with a penalty before the break but Snyman made a mess of the restart coughing possession back to Saracens. Jackson Wray’s strong carry punched a hole and Tompkins’ nimble hands on the blindside found Sean Maitland hugging the touchline. A step inside, a slipped tackle and Saracens had a 22-13 lead at the interval. It grew after the restart when Leicester botched a quick lineout in their own half. Several phases later Goode, on the front foot in midfield, played a cute pop off his shoulder against the grain for an onrushing Vincent Koch. The World Cup-winning South African prop cantered over like an outside back with a six-pack. Leicester needed a response to underline their status as league leaders and it came when Dolly kept in contact with a fracturing maul to keep the Tigers in the hunt. They stayed camped in Saracen’s territory but could not find a way through but were offered an opportunity when Davies was shown yellow for a head on head collision with Ford with 20 minutes remaining. Leicester’s frustration showed after an important steal from Billy Vunipola under his own posts. Calum Green was fortunate not to be sent to the bin for a neck roll on the England No 8. Saracens couldn’t get out of their own half and Leicester kept hammering at the door. Ollie Chesum set up a grandstand finish by tunnelling through a sea of bodies to score. Ford’s conversion closed the gap to two points. But Saracens would have the final say. Woolstencroft, with his seventh try in five games and his eighth of the season, added gloss to an impressive display that could well be a dress rehearsal for June’s final in Twickenham.",Sport/Sport,Woolstencroft seals it for Saracens to end Leicester’s unbeaten record,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/05/saracens-leicester-premiership-rugby-union-match-report
3/6/2022,"For 45 minutes, Chelsea’s wounded players jogged around the Turf Moor pitch as if wondering what was the point of it all. To be fair this is a question many of us have been pondering of late, but given recent events at Stamford Bridge the problem felt particularly acute. What exactly are Chelsea playing for these days? Pride? Escapism? Third place? Thomas Tuchel’s job? Who would even fire him at the moment? Is anyone safe these days? Naturally, this suited Burnley just fine. They had troubles of their own to contend with, of course, and after a reasonably solid first half harboured genuine hope of an unexpected point in their struggle against relegation. Wout Weghorst and Dwight McNeil could even have put them ahead. Still, the mood as both teams emerged after the break was ebullient. What happened next really depends on your interpretation of events. Did Chelsea rediscover their sense of vim and purpose, shake themselves out of their Sky Sports News-induced stupor and learn that the joy of good football is its own reward? Did Burnley crumble and collapse on the altar of their own premature ambition? Or did the team with better footballers just start doing better football things? All we know for certain is that within two minutes Reece James had given Chelsea the lead, and six minutes after that Kai Havertz made it two, and two minutes after that Havertz scored again, and by the time Christian Pulisic made it 4-0 after a comical James Tarkowski error people were already beginning to leave. Those who stayed watched in a sort of sullen dejection, occasionally breaking their silence to barrack Burnley players for passing it straight out of play, or both pressing the same man, or occasionally tackling each other. In many ways it was Burnley who seemed to be experiencing the existential crisis in the second half: a team with a shape but no form, a plan but no vision, just doing vaguely the same things every week in the hope that it will somehow scrape together 38 points. There are good players at this club, skilled players, players with teeth and hunger. Too little of that has been evident this season. Is there more to life than simply bunting it up the touchline and hoping a couple of deflections go your way? We may be waiting some time to find out. N’Golo Kanté was sensational, skating and slaloming across the pitch as if it were his pitch, gliding and flicking the ball as if it were his ball. Attacks seemed to quicken as they moved through him. He had a hand in three of the goals, and it was he alone who seemed to grasp the urgency of the game and the speed of ball required to win it. Does Kanté worry about how the war in eastern Europe and the threat of sanctions will affect his professional ambitions over the next few years of his career? Probably. He’s a smart cookie. But what we can say for sure is that he doesn’t play like it. Kanté to the wing-backs was the ball that kept doing the damage, James on the right and Saúl Ñíguez on the left pushing high, latching on to Kanté’s diagonals and creating mayhem. First James twisted and turned McNeil before firing low across Nick Pope, then Havertz headed home Pulisic’s cross after more good work from James. Then it was 3-0: Kanté again, James again, Havertz falling into the goal but somehow managing to hook the ball with him as he did. The fourth was the most calamitous of all. Tarkowski, under no real pressure, simply tapped Saúl’s cross into the path of Pulisic, who looked almost embarrassed as he buried the ball from four yards. The rest of the game was played out to the sound of Chelsea singing a refrain that had begun even before the start, as Turf Moor stood to observe a moment of solidarity for the people of Ukraine. The warm applause was quickly broken by Chelsea fans launching into a chorus of “Roman Abramovich”. This in turn was met by boos from the Burnley fans. On the big screen a message read: “Football Stands Together”.",Sport/Football,Chelsea and Kai Havertz turn on style after half-time to easily topple Burnley,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/05/burnley-chelsea-premier-league-match-report
3/6/2022,"At this rate the relegation zone will soon have receded to a mere speck in Newcastle’s rearview mirror. Eddie Howe’s unbeaten league run now extends to eight games, five of which have been won, leaving his team well on course for the sunlit uplands of mid-table. But after a bright start they did not have things all their own way against the recently stumbling Brighton. Indeed it took an excellent performance at centre-back from a Brighton old boy, Dan Burn, to preserve three vital points and consign the visitors, who often dominated possession, to a fourth straight league defeat. Brighton’s third choice kit is blue and yellow – the colours of Ukraine – and they elected to wear it here in support of a country under Russian attack. By the 11th minute their manager, Graham Potter, had reason to regret allowing Burn to start pulling on black and white stripes. The towering defender has reinforced Newcastle’s defence significantly since arriving from the south coast for £13m at the end of the January transfer window, and his former teammates seemed to be missing his stabilising influence as Jacob Murphy showed a clean pair of heels to a rearguard fooled by Chris Wood’s fine through ball. Although Murphy’s eventual chipped shot rebounded off a post, the on-rushing Ryan Fraser re-directed it into the back of the net. Three minutes later Fraser turned provider as Newcastle doubled their advantage. As Fabian Schär nodded the winger’s free-kick beyond Robert Sánchez’s reach and exultant home fans hugged random stewards, Potter’s head sunk deep into his hands. Fortunately for Brighton, Tariq Lamptey was not minded to surrender. Indeed, the right wing-back, who is much admired by Newcastle, petrified the hosts virtually every time he started running at Matt Targett and company. Suitably encouraged, Potter’s players came alive and began dominating possession. Martin Dubravka saved smartly from Danny Welbeck after the former England forward was adroitly cued up by Lamptey. Not for the first time, the moment had arrived for Joelinton to fully prove his worth as Newcastle’s reborn midfielder. The former striker showed his inner Patrick Vieira as he made some vital interceptions to prevent Brighton from reducing the deficit. Howe’s inspired reinvention of Joelinton is a very big reason why joyous chants of “Up the Premier League we go” echoed around St James’ Park, but the second half was only 10 minutes old when they were temporarily silenced. As Lewis Dunk connected with Pascal Groß’s corner and pulled a goal back for Brighton, confidence gave way to a certain nervous edginess. Sensing a shift in the power balance, Potter switched to a back four and sent on Neil Maupay to try to ruffle Burn. With his side struggling to regain control of a midfield in which Joe Willock had seemingly lost concentration and with Brighton’s Marc Cucurella looking menacing whenever he advanced from left-back, the time had come for Howe to re-introduce Allan Saint-Maximin to the action after a calf injury. But although the French winger’s electrifying change of pace and sheer unpredictability was soon bamboozling Dunk and his teammates, and Bruno Guimarães also impressed after stepping off the bench, Brighton still threatened, with Dubravka doing well to keep Leandro Trossard’s shot out to ensure Newcastle held on to victory.",Sport/Football,Fabian Schär uses his head to sink Brighton and keep Newcastle run going,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/05/newcastle-brighton-premier-league-match-report
3/6/2022,"The next Labour government will create a Britain that Scottish people “aren’t just part of, but proud of”, Keir Starmer has pledged, as he accused Tories and Scottish Nationalists of being “joined at the hip” in their desire to keep the country “stuck on pause in the politics of 2014 for ever”. The UK Labour leader charged Boris Johnson with weakening the union “every day that he remains in power”, telling activists gathered at Glasgow’s Royal Concert Hall: “I refuse to accept that all that matters is where people were in the Scottish referendum, or the Brexit referendum.” In his first address to a Scottish Labour conference since becoming leader, Starmer was explicit about the need for Scottish support for the party to win in Westminster. “Scottish votes have never carried more weight in a general election,” he said. “Those who pretend that Scotland can’t choose the government it wants are wrong.”. And to lengthy applause, he warned activists that “running away from the mainstream is running away from voters”. Continuing his robust approach to leftwing critics within Labour he said: “We can win and we can make change or we can pursue apparent political purity inside this party. But please make no mistake, we cannot do both. ” Dismissing the “cynical” and “distracted” Tory government in Westminster – “so disreputable that even the Scottish Tories are actually embarrassed by it” – Starmer told his audience: “I am angry that we have allowed these Tories to beat us.” In a speech that quoted the late John Smith, Tony Blair, and Gordon Brown he said: “This is on all of us to fix and we can fix it. It is our duty to win. I believe we can. But still our greatest hurdle might not be the Tories, but ourselves.” Amid optimism that Labour’s surge in popularity at UK level may help revive the fortunes of the Scottish party, which remains the third party at Holyrood, Starmer promised that Brown’s Commission on the UK’s Future would “create a new blueprint for a new Britain”, and “unleash the power of devolution”. Slamming the records of both the Tories at Westminster and the SNP at Holyrood, he went on: “Beyond being joined at the hip in wanting to turn every election into the same referendum again, and again, they have no industrial strategy to meet the challenge of our age. They don’t have the credible policies we need to create and sustain decent jobs”. “Decades of power between them – neither the Tories nor the SNP has done enough to secure the jobs and industries of the future.” Early on in the address, Starmer struck a sombre tone, describing Putin’s aggression in Ukraine as “an affront to the values of this country, this party, and the international institutions, which we helped to build”. Inviting the conference hall to thank the British military and their families “for all they do to keep us safe”, Starmer repeated his demand for “the strongest sanctions” against Putin and promised the next Labour government “will also rebuild our own defences”. He concluded by telling activists he would not apologise for the party continuing to change: “Tony Blair said the only Labour tradition he’d wanted to change was losing – too right”, and committing to a “United Kingdom, re-engaged in the world, fierce in our defence of liberty, forever alert, and apologists for no one”.",News/Politics,Keir Starmer vows to create a Britain Scottish people are ‘proud of’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/05/keir-starmer-vows-to-create-a-britain-scottish-people-are-proud-of
3/6/2022,"The third most expensive footballer can be an incongruous presence in a mid-table meeting but he illuminated it. If the £142m fee Barcelona paid for Philippe Coutinho suggested his talents belonged on grander stages, he graced this one, gliding and ghosting around, confounding and eluding Southampton. They had held both Manchester clubs on an unbeaten run that spanned seven games but which was ended emphatically by Coutinho. Danny Ings’ first reunion with his former club proved his most productive afternoon for his new employers, yielding two assists and a goal, but the architect of Steven Gerrard’s biggest win as Villa manager was his flagship signing. Coutinho played a part in the first two goals, scored the third and departed to a standing ovation. Before then, he could have registered one of the quickest hat-tricks in Premier League history, courtesy of an extraordinary four-minute period where he had three golden chances, two supplied by Ollie Watkins and one saved by Fraser Forster, and still found time to set up Douglas Luiz’s goal. It was no wonder that Oriol Romeu, Southampton’s defensive midfielder and the man whose duties included subduing Coutinho, walked off at half-time shaking his head. Coutinho’s capacity to make excellence look effortless must have been depressing. Irrepressible as he was, it was not quite a one-man demolition job. Watkins was outstanding as well, scoring for a second successive Saturday and combining beautifully with Coutinho. His double act with Ings has rarely felt as natural or as fluent, with the question of what to do with the two strikers seeming a conundrum for both Villa managers this season. If Gerrard reaped a rich dividend for last week’s decision to pair them, putting Coutinho at the tip of a midfield diamond and benching Emi Buendía, the Brazilian showed he was very capable of being the lone creator. And, seven months after Ings signed from Southampton, Villa had a first: neither he nor Watkins had laid a goal on for the other. Then Villa’s front three teamed up, Coutinho feeding Ings, who provided a deft, incisive pass for Watkins, who turned away from Jack Stephens and shot, beating Forster. Ings had met with a few jeers from the visiting contingent at the start, which felt a case of ingratitude towards a member of a select band in Southampton history. Only Matt Le Tissier, James Beattie and Ings have scored 20 goals in a Premier League season for them and if he has never looked as prolific since his £25m move to Villa, he swept in his fifth from Matty Cash’s low cross. Sandwiched by Coutinho’s misses, as Southampton lost track of him and Watkins felt increasingly rampant, Douglas Luiz scored the second. The former Saint Calum Chambers seemed to borrow a pass from Coutinho’s handbook, with a deft chip over their defence, to find him and he teed up his fellow Brazilian for a simple finish. Ralph Hasenhüttl changed shape at half-time, introducing Yan Valery as a third centre-back. The fact his side conceded twice in nine minutes suggested it didn’t work. Found by Ings, Coutinho turned away from James Ward-Prowse in a crowded penalty area before drilling in a shot before the striker scored himself. And yet there is a case for arguing the scoreline is deceptive, simply because it could have been almost anything. Forster had made a terrific save from Watkins, when Coutinho found him, and denied Ings. At the other end, Stuart Armstrong, Che Adams and Romain Perraud all threatened first-half equalisers. Instead, they ended up thrashed, but by a player who caressed the ball.",Sport/Football,Philippe Coutinho orchestrates Aston Villa’s rout of Southampton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/05/aston-villa-southampton-premier-league-match-report
3/6/2022,"Paperless (Vespucci) | AcastWeekend (the Guardian) | theguardian.comUkrainecast (BBC) | BBC SoundsThe Rest Is History (Goalhanger Podcasts) | AcastThe Rest Is Politics (Goalhanger Podcasts) | Acast This is an audio column, as opposed to a radio-only one, or one that’s just about podcasts. I cover anything created especially for listeners: plays, podcasts, phone-ins, music shows, investigations, live broadcasts, constructed soundscapes, day-in-day-out programmes. If you can hear it over headphones, I’ll consider reviewing it, as long as it’s not a music album. For a while I’ve wondered whether I should include audiobooks. After all, many use broadcast techniques – Adam Buxton’s Ramble Book even included jingles – and I can already review several “actor reading a popular book” programmes on Radio 4. Audio genres are blurring and overlapping all the time. Which brings me to Paperless, an audio magazine by nonfiction production house Vespucci. Several episodes are simply a famous person reading a specially written article out loud. The most recent, Joy Boy, by Hallie Lieberman, is read by Steve Buscemi, and is – there is no way of disguising this – about dildos. Specifically, it’s the story of a man, Gosnell Duncan, a car mechanic who in 1965 had an accident at work. Afterwards, though he could no longer get an erection, Duncan still felt erotic urges and wanted to have sex, so he set up a home business making the best dildos he could. “He was building back his manhood,” narrates Buscemi, lightly, “one dick at a time.” So, you know, maybe listen to this one on headphones. You’ll enjoy it. It’s a great, surprisingly heartwarming story, read beautifully by Buscemi. There’s a bit of subtle soundscaping that helps the tale along (nothing too rude, don’t worry), and the episode proved cheering company as I marched around the park with the dog. (Actually, as a side point, our dog once found a dildo in the park. It made an excellent chew toy.) If you enjoy it, there are another 16 Paperless stories, including one narrated by Elle Fanning. Not all are read-aloud longform journalism though: I recommend Guarding Saddam, about the sort-of friendship that developed between the ex-president of Iraq and the young US soldier told to guard him. This takes the form of an edited interview with the soldier, Kelly Hillyer, carefully done by journalist Michael Weiss. It’s a remarkable listen, one of the most moving and thought-provoking things I’ve heard in a long time. It reminded me, a little, of Love + Radio; it has a similar emotional “pull back and reveal”, an unexpected gut-punch story twist. Anyway, if this sounds like your sort of thing, there are several other read-out-the-story podcasts for you out there. The Guardian started one a couple of weeks ago: Weekend. Though it’s offered as a way to “switch off from a busy week”, perhaps its biggest selling point is the regular narration of Marina Hyde’s always brilliant Friday political column. Who could fail to be delighted? Readers Emma Powell and Oliver Cudbill are clear and upbeat, and this is a lovely way to enjoy the Guardian’s great writers. (A small thing: if you’ve ever heard the real Marina Hyde speak, then you might find yourself taken aback when you hear her words read by Powell. Hyde’s real voice is more cut-glass and world-weary.) I remember my gran being sent tapes by the RNLI when her sight started failing: this is so much easier and more up-to-date for anyone who can’t access journalism in the usual way. And anything that gets Hyde’s columns to more people is good by me. Going back to the Guarding Saddam episode, I’ve been thinking about it a lot over the past few days. How can a human be human and order such terrible deeds to be done to others? This has been a pretty horrendous week. If you can cope with the news cycle, Amol Rajan and Martha Kearney have been doing well on Today, holding politicians to account, as they should. For analysis and live reporting, the BBC is always hard to beat in a news emergency. If you want a single programme to keep you up to date, then its new daily, Ukrainecast, is one you should try. Hosted by the warm but rigorous Victoria Derbyshire and Gabriel Gatehouse (The Coming Storm), this brings in analysts, reporters, experts and people on the ground in Ukraine. We’ve been hearing from Max, whose wife and oldest son Mark were seriously injured when a missile hit their building last week; Derbyshire came back to him on Tuesday. He was tender about his family; uncompromising about the situation. “This is slaughter,” he said. “There is no other term. Hellish slaughter, and my position and my demand to these demons is, Stop now and go to hell, to where you have come from.” For some historical context, and a way of countering any “but Ukraine is really Russian” arguments, then try The Rest Is History, hosted by Tom Holland and Dominic Sandbrook, who brought out a special episode on Monday, explaining Ukraine’s long and upsettingly difficult past. Occasionally, Holland and Sandbrook’s presenting skills can be a little slack (at one point, there were so many “ums” and “sort ofs” that I wondered whether to start a drinking game), but their knowledge, coupled with their silly camaraderie, is very comforting. There’s now a spin-off podcast, too, which launched last week: The Rest Is Politics, hosted by Rory Stewart and Alastair Campbell. It’s … OK, I suppose. I’m not sure that I need any more blokes who met Putin a few times a few years ago to speculate on how his mind works. Finally, I know that several programme-makers and podcast creators have been wondering whether they should carry on making their silly-but-diverting content during such terrible times. Speaking as someone who very much enjoyed a story about silicone penises read by Steve Buscemi last week, I say please continue.

3/6/2022,"A proposed new £600m solar farm in eastern England – covering an area eight times bigger than Hyde Park in central London – faces opposition over claims it would be a “blight” on the countryside. The scheme, which would provide power for up to 100,000 homes, will cover nearly 2,800 acres near Newmarket, more than 10 times bigger than any scheme built to date in Britain. It is one of more than 900 solar farms in the planning pipeline to help provide green energy. Campaigners say the Sunnica energy farm, which will span several villages in Suffolk and Cambridgeshire, will change the unique character of a vast area of countryside shaped by farming and horseracing. Suffolk county council said last week it would not support the scheme in its current form. Richard Rout, deputy council leader and cabinet member for finance and environment, said: “We recognise that renewable energy is a key part of delivering energy security but it can’t come at any cost or to the detriment of Suffolk or the environment.” John James, 74, who owns Brookside Stud, near Chippenham, Cambridgeshire, said: “The solar panels will blight several villages and take farmland out of production.” He was particularly concerned over the fire safety of the vast batteries that would be housed near his stud in containers up to six metres high. Finlay Colville, head of research at Solar Media, a business intelligence and digital media firm, said there are now about 910 possible solar farm projects in the pipeline in the UK, with numbers increasing by about a third in 2021. More than 300 have already submitted planning applications or have already been approved. Colville said some of the largest projects might not be delivered but there were also many smaller sites that were being approved. “Solar farms can be built quickly, and it’s a quick win for firms and public bodies which want to have more renewable energy,” he said. While many councils support renewable energy schemes, there are concerns about some large-scale projects, including the Cottam solar project on the Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire border, covering 2,800 acres; the Mallard Pass solar farm in Lincolnshire and Rutland, covering 2,175 acres; and the Gate Burton energy park, near Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, covering 1,690 acres. Sir Edward Leigh, the Conservative MP for Gainsborough, has raised concern about such large-scale schemes. He told parliament last month: “Is it not time we looked at how we can stop these companies bypassing local planning and secure proper community gain and the protection of agriculture, and ensure that there are buffer zones around villages?” Ministers say, where possible, large schemes should use previously developed land to help preserve farmland. Many smaller schemes arise from the demand for green energy in the public sector. Work started in November on a 30-acre scheme to help power the New Cross hospital in Wolverhampton, while the Ministry of Justice has proposed a two-acre installation next to Whatton prison, near Bingham in Nottinghamshire. Sunnica said its scheme would make a “significant contribution” to help the UK meet its net-zero targets by 2050. It said it would respond to any concerns raised over its scheme in the planning process, that it took the safety of its battery storage system very seriously and thta it had a package of proposed safety measures to mitigate the risk of a fire. A government spokesperson said: “We recognise the need to preserve greenfield land while protecting the environment as we work to generate more cheap, clean power in the UK. ​Solar energy developments, including these ones, are subject to strict planning controls to protect local communities and the environment. This includes the requirement to conduct environmental impact assessments and public consultations on planning applications.”",News/Environment,Light … or blight?

3/6/2022,"I’m hopelessly fond of birthdays. My mum put a lot of effort into them when I was younger (she did a scavenger hunt for my 10th and I still have the clue cards). However, Covid-19 changed the way we celebrate birthdays. Not being able to celebrate with family and friends was a real anticlimax for those reaching milestone ages. Imagine turning 18 and not being able to toast it with your mates in an overcrowded club with cheap shots. Covid-related restrictions ended last month, but will birthdays ever feel special again? My 30th was on Easter Sunday of 2020, at the height of restrictions, and the day that Dominic Cummings went to Barnard Castle to test his eyesight. But I made the conscious choice to savour the little details: the flowers I received, the music playing while I cooked dinner, the fact it was 18C out. The pandemic alleviated a lot of the stress that used to come with birthdays, given that everything was out of our control. Still, I am looking forward to the return of unregulated and (safe and responsible) hedonistic birthdays, because I will have an even deeper appreciation of what we’re celebrating – life. Last month, the government unveiled plans to change student loan repayments, lowering the salary threshold, extending the repayment period and threatening to enforce minimum GCSE and A-level entry requirements. Many variables can affect a young person’s performance and treating maths and English as the sole markers of intelligence devalues other skills needed in higher education, such as creative thinking. More than half of young people from disadvantaged households fail to achieve GCSE grade 4; now they will be penalised for life for marks they didn’t get as teenagers. Those who do achieve the required grades will still suffer long term. An equality analysis said the proposals would most affect younger and female graduates as well as those from disadvantaged backgrounds or the north of England, Midlands or the south-west. These reforms aren’t about young people’s futures, they’re about saving money, and it’s people from backgrounds like mine who will take the blow. I went to university aged 18 in 2008, moving from Leeds to London and from a low-income household. I never imagined I’d idealise my university debt, but payment plan 1 (lower interest rates and debt written off after 25 years) now seems like a sweet deal. Someone who is taking education into his own hands is the British artist Yinka Shonibare, renowned for his brightly coloured Dutch wax fabric sculptures. He has launched an artist residency programme in Nigeria (where he was brought up) to help foster “exchange between artists of different cultures and career paths” across two sites in Lagos and on a working farm in Ijebu. Shonibare curated last year’s Royal Academy summer exhibition, to critical acclaim. I interviewed him then and what was clear is his commitment to community, collaboration and fostering talent among those who come from marginalised backgrounds or lack formal training. His programme joins similar efforts by artists such as Amoako Boafo, Ibrahim Mahama and Va-Bene Elikem Fiatsi in Ghana and Kehinde Wiley in Senegal. Artists of the African diaspora, from Lubaina Himid to Wangechi Mutu, are starting to shift the canon, and Shonibare’s project couldn’t have arrived at a better time.",Opinion/Opinion,I’m looking forward to après-Covid birthdays | Kadish Morris,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/05/looking-forward-apres-covid-birthdays
3/6/2022,"Last week my Twitter feed was overflowing with warmth, gratitude, memory and reflection in the wake of people hearing that Shirley Hughes is no longer with us. For many, she has been an intergenerational author, delighting people when they were children, then as parents reading to their children and even once more within the same lifetime, as grandparents reading to their grandchildren. This huge span came about because Shirley’s first book solely created by her – Lucy and Tom’s Day – appeared in 1960. She has gave us 60 years worth of work and no doubt there’ll be one or two more to come out of the drawers. Many of the people talking about the books on social media have homed in on the strongly personal effect they had. It’s not hard to see why. Shirley created art, stories and poetry that took children’s feelings as seriously as others take adults’ feelings. We live in a strange cultural world in which a fair number of people devote a lot of attention and expense exploring the importance and long-lasting effect of their childhood emotions and yet artists who dwell on such things in a way that is accessible for children are often placed low down in the league table of great art. Clear favourites among Shirley’s books on my social media seem to be Dogger, any of the Alfie books – especially Alfie Gets in First, and Out and About. So how did she do it? What are the ingredients of her work that had this great effect? In my conversations and interviews with her, she pinpointed several things: her grounding in life drawing (she trained at the Ruskin School of Art), and her strong rejection of the idea that she was delivering something “cosy”. Of course, children’s books are by and large reassuring – at least in their conclusions. The point about Shirley’s books is that on the way, they created moments of danger, loss, or, to borrow a frequent family word, “bother”. These are actually big moments, and by that I mean big for very young children, who in Shirley’s worldview are not made insignificant for being very young. Just take one cataclysmic moment from Dogger: Dave has lost his soft toy, it turns up on a stall at the school summer fair. He tried to explain that it’s his – but no, he has to buy it. But he hasn’t got enough money to buy it. He rushes off to get more money, gets it, but when he comes back, someone else has bought Dogger. For Dave in the book, and for a child hearing or reading the story and indeed for any empathetic adult, this is a moment of anguish. What comes into play here is basic feelings about attachment and detachment. Dogger is Dave’s “transitional object”, his mother substitute if you like, and he is forcibly separated from it. The work done by readers reading literature is done right here: we make connections between events, thoughts and emotions through metaphors and symbols. Dogger is Dogger, but what Shirley has shown Dogger to be for Dave, and what Shirley shows happens to Dogger, means a lot more. And being detached is a feeling that isn’t bounded by age, which explains why and how Shirley’s books are, as I say, so intergenerational. Another way of putting this is to say that Shirley was very knowledgable about children and childhood, but clearly this knowledge wasn’t put into psychology textbooks. It’s in the psychodramas she plays out on the pages of her books. The point about her life drawing is not just that she was good at it, but also that the faces, gestures, body shapes and postures of the children she painted are each full of living drama. We might say that of course they feel very human or that they’re lively, or warm, but their ability to capture tiny but significant changes of mood – irritation, wonder hopelessness, generosity, cunning – is quite remarkable. By the way, I can remember her demonstrating to me how the pages in her books were varied according to a principle: she wanted the child’s eye to be constantly surprised by each new double-page spread. Each page should, she thought, be full of discoveries, things to explore and find. Missing from all this, though, is something else: Shirley Hughes bore witness to a changing landscape, cityscape and human-scape of the last 60 years. I have 16 or so of her books and across the pages, we can see the unfolding of a culturally diverse community, living and working in the spaces that urban living gives us. In the collection of four stories, Tales of Trotter Street, Shirley’s eye moves across faces, two people talking, groups at play, toys, animals, schools, home interiors, parks, street scenes, and people at work. All the while, she dwells on the “thinginess of things” so we can hear the concrete mixer and pick up the red cup. Children’s literature has contributed more than a fair share to the world “pastoral” – a rural idyll with more than a hint of Eden. This is not to knock it; I’m as big a fan of the Hundred Acre Wood and the Wild Wood, as the next person, but Shirley broke with that tradition. Her characters are rooted in an urban space, facing difficulties, overcoming them more often than not with love and kindness. I sense that she challenged herself to do this. She didn’t rely on conjuring up a misty view of her own childhood but looked very hard at what family, school and street looked and felt like around her, her children and her children’s children. Her body of work is a gift, given to children and those who care for children. It enables us to care for each other.",Arts/Books,How Shirley Hughes explored the dramas of children’s lives in a changing world,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/05/shirley-hughes-explored-the-dramas-of-childrens-lives-in-a-changing-world-michael-rosen
3/6/2022,"Our eldest grandchild just celebrated his birthday and, as ever, that meant a bonus unbirthday gift for me. I’ve been a grandfather for 12 years now and oh my tottering days what a laugh it all is. Cynic Laureate Philip Larkin may have had a point about mums and dads, but let’s be honest, he was clueless about grandparents. The thing is, they don’t fuck you up, your gran and gramps. They do not mean to, and they don’t. It’s easy to fall short as a parent, but almost impossible to be a terrible grandparent. I’ve done both, trust me. And maybe – maybe – this will be the year we get to see all our grandchildren again, together. God, 2020 and 2021 feel like an entire epoch: the Epidemiolithic Period. It’s been so hard on so many people for so many reasons, but a massive arthritic fistbump to fellow grandparents unable to cuddle their darlings for so long. My NHS category is “clinically paranoid” so in hard lockdown we could only wave at the two grandchildren who live 10 minutes away, and only Skype the other two in Seoul. We haven’t seen the Korean contingent since 2019 and I know, I know, we’re really lucky and people have had it a lot worse and I am grateful for everything, but still… I dream of the day I’ve got all four of the little bastards where they belong, compelled to be in the same room under my adoring grandpatriarchal gaze. “Is there a rejuvenating effect of (grand)childcare?” burbled a recent study in the Journals of Gerontology. Not really, is the answer. That’s not the point. You don’t want to feel younger, you just want to be used up in as exhilarating a way as possible. “Is grandparenthood an absolute scream?” is a much better question. Yes, is the answer. How I envy people who are about to get the whole miraculous, hilarious surprise of it all, right in the face, for the first time. For those of you about to enter the second-generation game, here are a few pointers. The first epiphany comes early on, with the arrival of your first grandchild and in retrospect hardly qualifies as a surprise at all. It’s the realisation that the heart-swell of unconditional love you felt for your children, unique and unrepeatable, is very much not unique, 100% repeatable, and as infinite as the Marvel Universe. After the “Oh my God it’s happening again!” love-bomb, the dawning of the long surprise. You discover it’s not just the sweeping-strings-and-fireworks love that’s an equal sequel to first-wave parenthood. It’s the beautiful mundanity, the repeated, endless, quotidian love. The comfort of it, the lull and soothe of it, the ordinariness of hanging out, feeling at home with human beings from some strange future. Also, memento mori: you’re grandparents now, time’s conveyor belt of death is chugging on and you’re next off, sunshine. It’s good to be facing away from the drop and the darkness beyond. Cheers! Your life decisively changes on the day your children can outrun you. From that point on, being a responsible adult is moot if they can simply slip the surly bonds of birth and go careening into whatever danger is handy. A rocky gorge, say, or an enthusiastic Civil War re-enactment. From memory, the parental speed ratio happens when they’re about 12 (10 if you’re a smoker). The speed ratio when you’re a grandparent is much, much scarier. Your grandchildren can outrun you when they’re about four or, uphill, two. Then there’s the height ratio. It’s alarming, of course, when your children no longer look up to you. Physically, I mean. Everyone wants to see their children flourish, to outgrow them, but it’s weirder with grandchildren. While their enheightenment sails up at more or less the same rate as your children’s did, you are shrinking. I’m hunched and diminished after a lifetime of typing for a living and subject to one of life’s cruel jokes: after 40 you lose half an inch in height every decade. I’ve got Roald Dahl’s shrinks. As they go up, you go down, until you’re Ronnie Corbett in that sketch about class. Inevitably there’s the intelligence ratio. Oh, of course, your grandchildren are getting cleverer than you. What did you expect, thicko? Your children are cleverer than you, their children are cleverer than them, that’s how life’s brain-cascade works. My son beat me at chess before he reached puberty. My daughter was a better musician than me when she was three. Now my grandchildren have productivity levels that make Comrade Stakhanov look like Sergeant Bilko. You just nod ruefully when they say “No, that’s an arthropod,” or beat you at draughts or are fluently bilingual at the age of five while you improvise fart jokes. Wait, maybe I’ve got the Brain Shrinks. When in doubt, do silly voices. Old people are, according to TikTok folklore, mad clueless pillocks anyway. Young people expect you to come a bit unmoored in your dotage, so – time to explore your vocal range! You can easily amuse infant grandchildren by singing improvised nonsense to the simplest of guitar accompaniments, looming slowly up over the side of the cot like a demented moon. When they’re a little older I strongly recommend funnelling Ed Vere’s Mr Big (possibly our greatest work of literature) into a rolling burlesque of crappy New York accents and a vocalised “jazz” mocked into heavily sarcastic wubbeda-bubbeda-wap-blap-habbeda-squee-honk-ba-wap-blap-ga-plap-tsh-tsh parping bloody mayhem. Who else is going to be impressed with your “comedy” voices? Certainly not your social media friends, alert for any hint of cultural appropriation. Newsflash: even when grandchildren are at secondary school you can make them laugh. Just cover your face with a big saucepan, do a Clint Eastwood voice and bingo – the Mandalorian! That feeling you used to get as a parent when someone would just mind your kids for a couple of hours so you could both go out, eat underwhelming pizza and fret-bond about Barclaycard interest charges. Well being the other side of that, let me tell you, is something to be savoured. It’s not that you weren’t useful as Dad. Looking back, being Dad was honestly my core purpose on Earth. But when you’re a parent, utility is factored in. The endless waitings-around, the lifts everywhere, the being there, the feeding, sheltering, listening, the shock-absorption, the futile resistance, etc, were all part of the job, done on the hoof at parental full tilt. Looking after grandchildren is a much more stately affair. The usefulness you feel is frankly out of all proportion to the energy it requires. Nappies you can do in your sleep. Bathtime, easy. Yeah, we can feed them. Veg and fruit, of course. But also, come on, buttered white toast and two Mini-Magnums, let’s keep this between ourselves, look at the smile on your little face. My parents’ generation always said that the best thing about being grandparents is that “You can hand them back.” Do people still say that? Anyway, it’s not. The best bit comes just after they’ve arrived to be coddle-minded. You shut the front door with the usual wafted reassurances to one of your adult children, clasp your hands together like an earnest supply teacher and say, “So, what do you fancy doing?” What they fancy doing when they’re young is tipping 100 balls down the stairs and then laughing at your feigned surprise and outrage. Then, when you’re collecting the balls from all over the house, they yawn and ask for juice, so you get them a drink and eventually present them with 85 balls. You do it again, they shriek with excitement for the three whole seconds of plastic avalanche. Rinse, repeat. Exhausting but engaging. Treasure these moments. Because what they fancy when they’re older after a hard day at school is to zomb out in front of cartoons which, you discover, have been produced specifically to maim grandparents. I’m not a conspiracy theorist, I’m not having auditory hallucinations, it’s simply the awful, hideous truth. The grandchildren pause it, freeze-frame it, when you enter the room. Observe the faces of the arrested cartoon characters. They despise you. Every single character in Paw Patrol would love to reach through the screen and kill you. I’m not losing my mind here. Note: Hey Duggee gets a free pass. Hey Duggee likes grandparents. Nobody of sound mind wants to raise their children exactly as they were brought up. Parents have to believe they’re starting a new dynasty, not simply deepening Larkin’s coastal shelf of misery. Grandparents by and large accept their new honorary role to serve but not to interfere. Your job is to be quietly doing good stuff behind the scenes, not prancing around, guffing on about how brilliant things were when you were in charge. You want to be public servant Gordon Brown, not lying shit Tony Blair. And because both you and your grandchildren are now very much held in the moral orbit of your children, a gravitational axis develops between the doting and the dotee. Take social history. Your childhood is of limited interest to your own children. It just wasn’t that long ago to them. I became a father when I was 26; my formative years weren’t ancient history then. My grandchildren are way more impressed with the picture of me with Tommy the milkman’s horse than my kids were. They love that at midnight on New Year’s Eve 1960 the TV presenter turned a big wheel with “1961” on it upside down and said “Whichever way you look at it, it’s 1961!” There’s something about a childhood lived 60 years ago. Maybe it’s those classic children’s books you’re still reading to them set in that odd, uncertain postwar period but yeah, you start talking about dustcarts and school milk and dangerous firework-handling and corporal punishment and tiny, flickering Bakelite TVs and smoking indoors, and suddenly you’re CS Lewis. There’s also the matter of what the media call strong language. We nurtured our children in what was I hope a congenially laissez-faire environment. We both came from rigid working-class families where swearing was proscribed and indeed punished. We swung happily and hippily the other way: our two grew up in a world of blue air. Now the pendulum has swung back. Bad language is discouraged. I take no pleasure in being Sweary Grandpa, except obviously I do. My grandchildren love my scandalising their parents. It’s big, it’s clever and they are very impressed with my extensive repertoire. Look, old age brings many sweet epiphanies, among them a bargaining with decline and an uncomplicated gratitude. Everyone’s days are numbered, but up here at the blunt end, life’s an all-year Advent calendar. Each day a new door, each door a new day. “Still here!” after a few years quietens into something more peaceful, without the astonisher and the quote marks. I don’t get out so much. Deepening ailments and intersecting conditions limit my excursions and this is good news for everyone else. Young people are trying to sort out this careening lorry-bomb of a world; they don’t want clueless old geezers clacking on about the Cuban missile crisis or Thatcher’s second term. As I never tire of saying, we should lower the voting age to 16 and withdraw the vote from anyone in receipt of a state pension. This is not our world any more. It belongs to our grandchildren, with their screeching YouTube videos and quiet disappointment in us for our negligence and fucking stupidity in setting the world on fire.

3/6/2022,"A 40-year-old man has appeared in court accused of murdering his parents. The victims, who were divorced, were found dead with stab wounds at two separate addresses in Gloucestershire on Wednesday morning. William Warrington was arrested on Wednesday morning and charged with the two killings on Friday evening. Clive Warrington, 67, was found dead at a property in Sherborne Place, Cheltenham, after reports of a serious assault at around 6.25am, Gloucestershire constabulary have said. His ex-wife, Valerie Warrington, 73, was found at an address in the village of Bourton-on-the-Water, about 15 miles away, a short time later. Warrington appeared at Cheltenham magistrates court on Saturday morning via video link and spoke only to confirm his name and date of birth. The magistrate, Andy Hill, remanded Warrington into custody and sent the case to Bristol crown court for a bail application on Tuesday, 8 March. Hill told the defendant: “These charges are too serious for us to deal with, and also too serious for us to deal with any application for bail.” On Thursday, Mr and Mrs Warrington’s family thanked wellwishers for the “outpouring of love and support” they had received after their deaths.

3/6/2022,"Brittney Griner, one of America’s most decorated women’s basketball players, has reportedly been detained by Russian Federal Customs Service authorities after the discovery of vape cartridges that contained hashish oil in her luggage at an airport near Moscow. The Customs Service confirmed “the detainee is a professional basketball player” who played in the Women’s National Basketball Association and won two Olympic gold medals with the United States in a statement issued on Saturday, but did not release the player’s name. Russia’s TASS news agency identified the player as Griner, a seven-time All-Star center with the WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury who helped lead the United States to gold medals at the Rio and Tokyo Olympic Games, citing a law enforcement source. According to the Customs Service statement, drug-sniffing dogs in the customs area of Sheremetyevo airport indicated the possible presence of narcotic drugs in the player’s baggage following her arrival on a flight from New York. A subsequent search of the luggage led to the discovery of the cartridges, a criminal violation under Russian law that carries a sentence of five to 10 years. The Kremlin-linked telegram channel Mash also published a video on Saturday in which the airport security services are seen going through the luggage of a passenger Mash identified as Griner. “Brittney Griner has the WNBA’s full support and our main priority is her swift and safe return to the United States,” the league said in a statement. Griner’s agent and a spokesperson for the Mercury did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the Guardian. The 31-year-old Griner, who led Baylor University to an undefeated season and a national championship in 2012 and Phoenix to the franchise’s third ever WNBA title in 2014, has also played for UMMC Ekaterinburg during the offseason since 2015, leading the Russian club to three domestic titles and EuroLeague Women championships in 2016, 2018, 2019 and 2021. Nearly 90 of the WNBA’s 144 rostered players have spent time playing overseas during this offseason, where the salaries from their foreign clubs often dwarf what they earn in the United States. Griner’s annual salary with UMMC of more than $1m per year is more than quadruple the WNBA’s league maximum of about $228,000. News of Griner being detained comes as Russian forces continue to bomb civilian targets on the 10th day of its invasion of Ukraine, and amid huge tensions between Moscow and the rest of the world. The US president, Joe Biden, has condemned the invasion of Ukraine, and pushed a raft of sanctions with other world leaders against Moscow which he says have left Putin isolated. On Saturday, the US state department urged US citizens to leave Russia immediately, re-issuing its travel advisory. Earlier Saturday, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine, held an hour-long video call with United States senators in which he called for more support to defend his country from Russia’s invasion. Rick Scott, a Republican, called for stronger measures against both Russia and its ally Belarus, tweeting that the US should take “EVERY action to destroy their economies”.",Sport/Sport,Women’s basketball superstar Brittney Griner detained in Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/05/brittney-griner-reportedly-detained-russia
