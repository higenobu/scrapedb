12/10/2021,"An album consisting entirely of birdsong has debuted towards the top of Australia’s Aria chart, beating Mariah Carey, Michael Buble and Abba to get to #5 one week after its release. Songs of Disappearance, a collaboration between multimedia duo the Bowerbird Collective and David Stewart, who has been recording the sounds of Australian birds for over four decades, features the calls and songs of 53 threatened species.  With all proceeds donated to BirdLife Australia, it has sold just over 2,000 units, around 1,500 of them in presale – a far cry from the number that used to be required to enter the charts, before the music streaming era. The project was the result of a conversation between the Bowerbird Collective’s Anthony Albrecht, a PhD student at Charles Darwin University, and his supervisor Stephen Garnett, the author of the recently updated Action Plan for Australian Birds, which found that one in six Australian birds are now threatened with extinction. “He asked whether the Bowerbird Collective could do anything to help promote [the Action Plan], and it was immediately obvious to me what we needed to do,” Albrecht said. “I’m really keen to understand whether environmental art such as this project can have an impact on attitudes and behaviour.” Albrecht’s collaborator and Bowerbird Collective co-founder, violinist Simone Slattery, arranged a musical collage of the 53 species for the opening track of Songs of Disappearance. The rest of the album’s tracks are of Stewart’s recordings in isolation. “I listened to the birds [as recorded by Stewart] one after the other and I found it incredibly moving,” Slattery said. “I kept listening until I could feel a structure coming to me, like a quirky dawn chorus. “Some of these sounds will shock listeners because they’re extremely percussive, they’re not melodious at all. They’re clicks, they’re rattles, they’re squawks and deep bass notes.” The collage ends with the morse code-like song of the night parrot, the enigmatic species whose call was entirely unknown to science until 2013. Another song featured is that of the regent honeyeater, which is now so rare that it is literally losing its own voice out of loneliness – a story that propelled it to its own top 10 placing in this year’s Guardian Australia Bird of the Year poll. “It’s a far more visceral way of processing this idea that these birds might disappear,” said Sean Dooley, national public affairs manager for BirdLife Australia. Dooley cheerfully invoked the catchphrase of Ian “Molly” Meldrum, suggesting Australian record buyers “do yourselves [and Australian birds] a favour”.

It’s much more than about biology. It’s about a much deeper attachment to our environment, and this is a way of reaching that in a way that words on paper don’t.” Garnett’s Action Plan has documented the increasing impact of fire and global heating on Australian birds. Stewart highlighted another issue: the catastrophic decline of insects, a view supported by the listing of the previously abundant bogong moth as endangered. “All our insectivores are in decline,” he said. “That’s where a big part of our problem lies. You’ve got climate change, plus the insecticides that are being pumped out everywhere.” Garnett said that may be a focus of the next Action Plan, which is updated each decade. “The last Action Plan didn’t have nearly as much stuff on climate change about it, because we didn’t have the evidence,” he said. “This one doesn’t have much on insect declines, because at this stage we don’t have the evidence. “In the wet tropics, we don’t really know yet how climate change is affecting the birds – is it affecting them directly; is it killing their food; is it enabling their competitors from the lowlands as they are able to go higher up the mountains, or a combination of those things. “It’s the same in the arid zone. When you get the silence that comes after a heatwave, is it because the insects have gone and therefore the birds starve, or is it because the birds themselves have been killed directly? We don’t know yet.”",News/Environment,‘Incredibly moving’: songs by threatened birds beat Abba to No 5 spot on Australian music charts,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/10/incredibly-moving-songs-by-threatened-birds-beat-abba-to-no-5-spot-on-australian-music-charts
12/10/2021,"One hundred and sixty-eight of Australia’s biggest companies have paid no tax since 2013 despite reaping profits totalling more than $9.85bn, a Guardian Australia analysis of new data reveals. They are among companies included in figures released by the Australian Taxation Office on Friday detailing the revenue, profit and tax paid by about 2,300 of the country’s biggest corporations in the 2019-20 financial year.  Previous ATO data dumps cover the period between 2013-14 and 2017-18, making it possible for Guardian Australia to determine which companies contained in the figures have not paid tax over the seven years for which numbers are available. The companies that paid no tax over the period include household names such as property developer Lendlease and the Australian arms of multinationals including oil and gas major Chevron and German engineering and technology group Bosch. Reasons why the companies have paid no tax vary. Some, including Lendlease, are part of property trust groups, where paying tax is the responsibility of the investor rather than the company. Some companies that did not pay any tax, such as subsidiaries of BHP and Rio Tinto, are members of corporate groups where another entity paid their taxes for them. Others, including Australian Chevron subsidiary Chevron Australia Holdings, have hefty losses run up in previous years that they are able to draw upon to offset their tax payments. The data also illustrates the rollercoaster ride that Qantas has been on as it swung from a $2.8bn loss in 2013-14 and back into profit. It took until 2017-18 for the flag carrier to eat through its prior year losses and pay some tax – a relatively modest $11m. In 2018-19 the company paid significantly more, $259m, off the back of taxable income – the tax equivalent of profit – of $942m. But the coronavirus crisis, which grounded much of the fleet, drove the airline to a $1.9bn loss in 2019-20 and its tax bill back to zero. Qantas lost another $2.35bn in the year just gone, meaning it is unlikely to pay tax for several years to come even as air travel resumes after the pandemic and the company moves back into the black. Speaking ahead of the release of the most recent set of corporate tax transparency figures, ATO deputy commissioner Rebecca Saint said there were “legitimate reasons why a company may not pay tax”. “Just because an entity doesn’t pay tax doesn’t necessarily mean that there’s tax avoidance or similar activity occurring. There can be good commercial justification to that,” she said. “We have high levels of confidence around those entities that don’t pay tax and what I mean by that is we actually go and have looked into whether those losses are generated from commercial activities, as opposed to tax avoidance arrangements.” One-third, or 782, of the 2,370 companies captured in the 2019-20 data set paid no tax that year. The data is published under laws introduced when Labor was in power federally and includes the revenue, taxable income and tax paid by public and foreign-owned companies with a turnover of $100m or more and Australian private companies with a turnover of $200m or more.",News/Australia news,Household names: 168 Australian companies have paid no tax since 2013,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/10/household-names-168-australian-companies-have-paid-no-tax-since-2013

12/10/2021,"One of Australia’s largest beer manufacturers has been rationing its most popular canned beer in the lead-up to Christmas, amid supply chain issues due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Shortages of wooden pallets and aluminium respectively have hit Australia’s two beer giants, Lion and Carlton & United Breweries (CUB).  But people craving a cold one on Christmas Day shouldn’t panic, with the industry pouring cold water on talk of major shortages over summer. CUB says while it is not facing shortages of kegs or its Australian-brewed stubbies or cans, the company recently had to limit the sale of some items due to aluminium shortages. “To be clear, we are not facing shortages of VB, Carlton Draught, Great Northern, Carlton Dry, or Pure Blonde,” sales director Peter Bingeman said in a statement to Guardian Australia. “Recently we had limited the sale of our most popular canned beer for a short time due to aluminium shortages, but those shortages have been successfully managed.” Purchase limits introduced on various CUB products at alcohol retailer BWS are anticipated to be lifted by the middle of next week. Bingeman said there were international supply chain issues for the Mexican beer Corona, which is imported by CUB. “However, we expect supply will continue to arrive in Australia in the lead-up to Christmas and we are distributing it fairly to retailers across Australia to help limit shortages,” he said. BWS is not anticipating beer shortages over the busy Christmas and New Year period. Lion, which makes Tooheys, XXXX, Hahn, Furphy and James Squire, is among a number of businesses affected by a widespread shortage of wooden pallets. The situation, labelled “pallet-gate” by the Coles CEO, Steven Cain, in October, has forced Lion to prioritise its most popular products as the busy holiday season looms. Products less in demand have been left to dwindle out of stock, unlikely to be back in production before 2022. Sales director Warwick Parks confirmed Lion was being impacted by “a number of supply chain challenges, including an industry-wide shortage of hardwood pallets”. “We recognise this is a busy and important time of year for our trade customers and we are doing everything possible to minimise disruptions to supply and delivery,” he said. “We are working around the clock to source alternatives and secure additional pallets.” The shortages are anticipated to affect specific pack sizes as opposed to entire brands – for instance, the same beer may be unavailable in a 10-pack but available in a six-pack. A spokesperson for Lion said the company wanted to reassure the community there would be no issue getting beer for Christmas. “We have been prioritising production of our top-selling pack formats in response to the national shortage of hardwood pallets and other supply chain challenges. This means that while some pack formats for certain brands may go out of stock, the vast majority of our main pack formats will still be available right through the festive season.” Lion had been “working behind the scenes to secure additional pallets and source alternatives to keep the beer moving”. A spokesperson for BWS owner Endeavour Group, which also owns liquor chain Dan Murphy’s, said coolrooms were “filled with stock ahead of Christmas”. Alcohol Beverages Australia CEO, Andrew Wilsmore, also sought to reassure shoppers there “will still be plenty of drinks to choose from”. “Some products, however, may not be available due to global supply chain disruptions and local pallet availability which is hampering the delivery of beer, wine and spirits to retail and hospitality businesses. All parts of the industry’s supply chain are working closely together to resolve any delays.” The worries over beer supply come after reports of a champagne shortage and widespread supply chain issues in the lead-up to the Christmas period. “It’s a mess right now,” said associate professor Vinh Thai, who works in the department of supply chain and logistics at RMIT. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Thai said the pandemic has triggered a global shortage of empty containers, congestion at ports, and rising sea freight costs. As well, he said, the spike in Australia’s property market has led to a surge in timber importations for building, which has in turn created a shortage of timber to use for making wooden pallets. Disruptions at one point of the chain have a “multiplying effect” and hit consumer countries like Australia particularly hard, he said. “My prediction is, best-case scenario, things will ease out a little bit in the later half of next year,” Thai said. “In a conservative scenario, I would look into 2023.”",News/Australia news,"Australia’s big brewers ration beer supplies, but insist shortages won’t affect Christmas",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/10/beer-cheer-australias-big-brewers-say-shortages-wont-affect-christmas-supplies
12/10/2021,"This list is drawn from votes by Guardian music critics – each critic votes for their Top 20 albums, with points allocated for each placing. Check in every weekday to see our next picks, and please share your own favourite albums of 2021 in the comments below.  The Swedish pop star’s long-delayed fifth album embodies the platonic ideal of pop disco, steeped in Gaga (invigoratingly stern vocals about freeing one’s mind and body), Abba (piano stomps and trills), Donna Summer (the thumping 24 Hours) and Queen (melodramatic balladry). It transcends pastiche on the strength of her songwriting (you could swap almost anything here on to Dua Lipa’s Future Nostalgia) and the going-for-broke intensity of it all. LS Blending the blast beats and acid-gargling glottal mayhem of black metal with the uplifting, even sentimental guitar dynamics of shoegaze, “blackgaze” has become a vibrant corner of heavy music – and Danish quintet MØL became one of its best exponents with their second album. The moody breakdowns allow the explosive choruses to land all the more righteously, with vocalist Kim Song Sternkopf – a survivor of faith cults as a child – venting majestically into the mic. Tracks such as Serf bring in a groove metal sensibility to help it all swing. BBT Some of the year’s best musical storytelling lived in the Virginia songwriter’s third record, her writing newly amplified by subtle hints of pop propulsion and grit that evoked how Elliott Smith expanded his sound. Dacus reflects on her teenage years – of church and bible camp, of budding queer desire amid a culture of shame and damnation, of the fantasies that let her escape these limitations – with such tender curiosity that these vignettes feel less like fixed memories than forensic crime scene reconstructions. Read the full review. LS The truly self-assured rarely make a noise about it, and so it is with the third album by Japanese girl group Chai. To blissed-out, dreamy synth-pop that buoys you along like a lazy river – occasionally spiked by classic rap throwbacks and arcade-game electro – the four-piece dreamily hymn the joys of food, self-acceptance and protest, nurturing their own laid-back take on pleasure activism. LS A songwriters’ songwriter beloved of Elbow and Arctic Monkeys, Stephen Fretwell was washing pots in a Wetherspoon’s pub, his music career having flatlined amid fatherhood. He hauled himself up and gave music another shot, apparently at the cost of his marriage. So these songs are the work of a truly inveterate musician, and it shows – Fretwell has such a natural facility for an affecting turn of melody, his simple fingerpicked guitar made eerie by the subtle ambient tones that sit behind it. BBT Poignant memories seem to lengthen and soften as we age, but this album is a reminder of how much jagged heft they have when you’re looking back after just a few years or months. David Balfe, 30, reflects on a dead best friend, poverty, trauma and the intense vibrancy of young friendships and creativity, in long recitations set to music that reaches towards techno and house. “You’re told you need to grow cold to grow old,” Balfe says, but he remains charged up with human warmth on these songs. Read the full review. BBT You don’t tend to get many Top 5 charting albums from bands who blend klezmer, post-punk, jazz and prog with lyrics about failed romance at a science fair, but Black Country, New Road managed it. That success is testament to how particular and fresh their sound is amid the ordinary boys of British indie, further helped by a really arresting frontman, Isaac Wood. Whether it’s really him or a persona, he is haughty, easily hurt, lustful, clumsy and incurably romantic – a wonderful, flawed character. Read the full review. BBT For this album, made remotely last year, guitarist Orcutt improvised to Corsano’s drum tracks, observing the waveforms as he recorded “so I could see when a crescendo was coming or when to bring it down”, he said. It’s reminiscent of a surfer’s mentality, and Made Out of Sound feels thrillingly like the trusty unpredictability of broaching the sea: absurdist guitar begets quieter contemplation; burnished riffs harden and soften, then collapse. Throughout, the open-ended sense of beauty is undimmed. LS Metal’s potential for thunderous anger makes it the most naturally expressive music to vent the fear, confusion and even shame of the climate crisis. “The greatest miracle is burning to the ground,” laments Joe Duplantier with bafflement and urgency, singing about the Amazon but perhaps also the entire planet. Other songs are direct rallying cries to save Earth (Into the Storm, Sphinx); Another World turns jaded and escapist, but is offset by The Chant, whose hearty chorus is the kind of thing a post-apocalyptic band of survivors would sing while rowing across a flooded city. Fortitude is an album that surveys humanity’s idiocy, but also its tenacity. BBT The joyous ecclesiastical energy of house enriches your soul on listening to this full-length from the US producer, which also chimes with the desire for optimism and gregariousness amid the waning pandemic. Like a lot of the best underground dance artists in recent years (Skee Mask, Anz etc), she firmly embraces the breakbeat-driven sound of the early 90s – Ride Free even has the same Peter Fonda sample as Primal Scream’s Loaded – and further enriches those busy, cymbal-heavy rhythms with zesty detailing: rave melodies, declarative vocal samples, penetrating bass notes. Read the full review. BBT Who is Lana Del Rey really? The question that has animated her decade-long career has sometimes riled her, but the first of two albums she released this year turns introspective to consider the matter. Was she happiest as a 19-year-old waitress listening to Kings of Leon, as she sings in stunning falsetto on White Dress? Is she most herself as a sister, a lover, a star, an adopted Californian – or embracing her wanderlust and escaping all that? The myth and melodrama, at least, remain unchanged on a Lana album made with an unusually light touch. Read the full review. LS With pop-punk surging this year, Paramore’s influence may never have been stronger – but the band’s flag bearer continued to burrow away from incandescent rock into stranger, subtler sounds. Williams’ second solo album in two years observed the dying days of her marriage, and how the reliability of sadness became its own sort of safe harbour. That strange sense of comforting desolation hums through in acoustic guitar and ghostly piano, although Williams’ innate way with a vocal hook provides the defiant life force. LS The south London quartet’s debut was garage rock with a touch of psych; this sophomore album grandly scaled that second element up, using synths to crack open a portal out of the drab, repressive everyday. The bigger ambition was partly predicated by one member surviving cancer, and the band don’t shy from big questions about life and death: the climate crisis, capitalism and the struggle to be allowed one’s truth and identity are among the topics broached. BBT Any crush has a delicate alchemy, and liable to lurch towards obsession or revulsion as the fantasy of someone duels with the reality. On the second album by the Portuguese-born Danish songwriter, her would-be lover may be a braggart who is rude to waiters, but that smile is irresistible: what are you gonna do? Her minimalist take on turn-of-the-millennium R&B shivers with sensitivity, essaying every heart flutter and gut punch in plush bass, glassy percussion and elegant strings, while De Casier’s coy delivery brims with a beguiling sense of mystery. Read the full review. LS This is the kind of slippery, funny, explosively creative record that perhaps could only be made in the UK. Yorkshirewoman Aya Sinclair mulches various bits of club culture in to a fetid, sweating mass – grime, breakbeat, drill, the off-kilter electronics of Autechre, the hyper-contemporary bass shudder of the late Sophie – and threads vocals through it, her surreal non sequiturs and body horror hovering on the edge of rap. BBT It’s one of pop’s sweetest narratives: former child stars escape the machine to make a great, offbeat record. Fourteen years after their last album, one-time Disney performers Aly and AJ softened their synth-pop pedigree in this dreamy collection of west coast pop-rock, a vision of Robyn-gone-Laurel Canyon that also might sate anyone left hoping for a bit more brooding from this year’s Kacey Musgraves album. LS The psychedelic, shoegaze-y haze has gradually lifted from Adam Granduciel’s band, burned off under a rising sun as their success has grown. He now stands in the midday of his career, with this fifth album fully embracing bright, mainstream classic rock. Powered by those distinctive WoD backbeats, which match the tirelessness of Granduciel’s search for love, perspective and contentment, these songs are huge in scale: both the arrangements and the strength of feeling. Read the full review. BBT In the TikTok phenomenon PinkPantheress’s micro-pop gems (only two songs on her debut project exceeded two minutes), classic drum’n’bass samples double as nagging memories and overwhelming rushes of adrenaline, swirling around lyrics about obsession and disappointment made more sinister by her innocent, breathless voice. Fourteen years ago, Burial’s transient, lonely, sodium-lit sound became associated with the experience of sitting on the night bus. PinkPantheress makes music befitting another after-hours rite of passage: that bleary-eyed, rueful stumble through bright lights and swarming crowds as you try to hold it together. LS The New Yorker’s second album is almost confrontationally still: brass like wisps of smoke, guitar a gentle thrum, softly puddling cymbals. Once the aftershocks of a loss have settled, Jenkins takes stock of what’s gone for good – Ambiguous Norway orbits her memories of David Berman, whose band Purple Mountains she was set to tour with prior to his death – and how learning how to trust again might yet retrieve her stolen sense of peace. LS Low’s last album, 2018’s Double Negative, was a total reinvention 25 years into a virtually undented career – a staggering achievement for any band. Yet somehow Alan and Mimi Sparhawk transcended it with this follow-up, bridling its predecessor’s swashbuckling noise until it splintered, and contrasting it with electronic reimaginings of the forlorn atmospherics that made their name. The sheer invention contrasted devastating lyrics about hitting a wall – drawn from the couple’s experiences dealing with Alan’s depression – imbuing these static hymns to limits and perseverance with a superhuman sense of determination. Read the full review. LS There’s a wonderful sense of liveness to this record, evoking a dive bar with a fug of weed smoke sitting at shoulder height. On stage is London-born Aria Wells, whose delivery is natural and improvisatory: vowels that bend drowsily downwards, or rap flow that sits on top of the beat without being too fussily precise. Behind her a band shuffle through a selection of grooves – reggae, neo-soul, hip-hop – that add up to a sensual, instinctive album that you could imagine Amy Winehouse making on a different timeline. Read the full review. BBT A strong self-preservationist streak ran through several highly anticipated albums by pop’s young women this year, with the likes of Billie Eilish, Lorde and Kacey Musgraves opting for lower-key sounds that poured cool water on heightened expectations. Among them was Clairo, whose second album left behind bedroom electro-pop for perfectly turned miniatures of Carole King’s warm classicism. Irrepressibly, sweetly funky, it sounded like music for pushing the furniture back and dancing on the living room rug – and Clairo’s lyrics, about breaking with relationships that no longer served her, underscored that joyful intimacy. Read the full review. LS Every stage of a breakup is sung in chronological order here: marital worries, hope for the relationship being good enough, worsening arguments, split, poignant staring at old photos, perspective gained, exciting/depressing ventures on to dating apps, eventual feeling of true freedom. Swerve a couple of tepid chillout-compilation moments and along the journey you alight at some of Musgraves’ prettiest songwriting, nicely leavened with her straight-talking, wearily dismayed tone of voice. Read the full review. BBT It was perhaps slightly overshadowed by its backstory: Annie Clark’s father’s release from prison, which, for some listeners, cast the entire record in an unsympathetic light. But its lyricism was much richer than one man, and its 70s-inspired music richer still: psychedelic soul, cabaret songcraft, prog ballads, cosmic funk. Clark remains a highly literate and shapeshifting songwriter, where half the fun is working out how much is ironised and how much is real. Read the full review. BBT In a feat of lockdown recording, Dave Fridmann produced Mogwai’s 10th studio album over Zoom and Atticus Ross directed an orchestra in Budapest via remote connection from Los Angeles. The classic Mogwai physicality remained undimmed by these virtual limitations, however, swerving between twinkling beauty (Dry Fantasy) and pleasingly barbed dirges (Ceiling Granny), and chucking in a new bag of glitter (Supposedly, We Were Nightmares) for good measure. Happily for all involved, it became their first UK No 1 album. Read the full review. LS A relatively austere and serious release from the collagist hip-hop beatmaker, letting his fabled samples really stretch out and inhabit the songs instead of chopping between them – a result of Kieren “Four Tet” Hebden arranging the album. There’s still room for Madlib’s trickster energy though, as found in a chaotic blurt of mayhem-inducing rap duo MOP. The title track is spiritual jazz, but that genre’s mood pervades the entire album, as Madlib communes with more than half a century of sound. Read the full review. BBT On her second album, Billie Eilish not only defied the tacit assumption that there’s nothing less appealing than complaining about the ravages wrought by fame but reinvigorated the cliche by toying deliciously with concealment and exposure. She sings about sexual fantasies and clandestine assignations and the power she can wield to keep her partners quiet, flexing her ability to carry on in secret – despite manifold violations of her privacy – as if it were a coveted jewel. She and her collaborator brother Finneas brought the same thrill to intimacy as they did to adolescent fears on her debut, tracing the scope of Eilish’s newfound commitment to her own pleasure in dreamy golden-age classicism and hormone-spiking techno. She let her listeners share in sensation even if the details were off-limits. Read the full review. LS Promises is an album that rewards patience. Not only was it Pharoah Sanders’ first major recording in a decade – and a record five years in the making itself – but its nine movements unfolded with a rare subtlety. A chiming refrain written by Sam Shepherd (AKA Floating Points) and played by the LSO sparkled like dawn’s first light, its sense of potential undimmed over 45 minutes of repetition. Sanders’ saxophone playing, lightyears softer than the blazing attack that made his name, activated that magic. The harmony between them generated its own sense of orbit, with cello and violin solos and the moving spectacle of Sanders’ singing voice balanced in a kind of celestial harmony. Read the full review. LS After enduring the humiliation of her old label dropping her with a seven-line email, Mvula donned the musical equivalent of shoulder pads – namely the 1980s’ gated drums, pugilistic bass and immaculately buffed synths – for this supreme display of confidence against the odds. The stylisation never comes at the expense of heart, either: Mvula delves deep as she searches for freedom in desire, art and within her own body, stretching her voice into majestic, wild anthems of liberation. Read the full review. LS Few of their peers from the 00s indie boom are so hale and hearty; 20 years into their career, the Merseyside band made their most ambitious album, and one of their best. It’s a double concept album about a seaside resort, and captures those towns’ blend of buckets-and-spades buoyancy and out-of-season malaise; gorgeous harmonies flow through jangling psych-pop and touches of northern soul, though there’s also creepy rockabilly emanating from the ghost train and ballads for lonely fishermen at the end of the pier. Read the full review. BBT The year’s biggest musical revelation came from Pakistani composer Arooj Aftab, who set traditional Urdu ghazals (and an adaptation of a poem by Rumi) amid harp and strings that rippled and ran as clear as a fresh stream. In her rich, meditative vocals, Aftab weighed the beauty of a single phrase and tenaciously addressed existential disappointments; her small ensemble shapeshifted between intricate filigrees and paring back to make a virtue of space. Made in response to the death of her younger brother, and released into an unprecedented global experience of grief, Vulture Prince was a refuge for solace and contemplation. LS “It’s like flying first class on a crashing plane,” Dave says of his fame and wealth at the outset of his second album. Few rappers have sounded so ill at ease with critical and commercial success as him – even when firing off bars about gorgeous women, there’s a wary, jaded tone to his voice. And in many ways, nothing has changed: he remains angry at the government over immigration and social mobility, and relationships certainly haven’t got easier. “Love’s a film and I’m just flicking through the parts I’m in.” That sense of a man looking down at his own life is Dave’s tragedy, and what makes his tracks such, well, psychodramas. Read the full review. BBT The compressed, febrile sound of 80s punk rock is resurrected for this terrifically entertaining record, where the jams are not just kicked out but also sent off the nearest cliff. The monstrous chug of cock-rock rhythm guitar underpins lead lines made for whipping a mane of hair around to, and Brendan Yates’s vocals have something of Perry Farrell’s yelled pronouncements to them. But there’s a dream-pop softness, too – not least in two songs with Blood Orange guesting – that adds emotional range. BBT The intimacy of new parenthood, where the world shrinks to a few rooms, is expressed in a new singular language by the south London musician (she also evokes the strangeness of those circumscribed Covid lockdowns). Breath, touch, kisses and sleep fill her songs, which conjure dub, hip-hop, post-punk and folk as if trying to remember them from a previous life. This album has the kind of utterly natural beauty that other artists strive towards, but will never reach because of that very striving. Read the full review. BBT For their most mainstream album yet, the band’s screams abated, the drums slowed their gallop, and the guitars took on a prettiness that recalled Coldplay at times. For certain metalheads, these are unforgivable sins and Deafheaven remain a divisive band – but for the rest of us, this is a stirring blend of arena rock and shoegaze that seems to fill the sky. Read the full review. BBT The spirit of Scott Walker fills this idiosyncratic and brilliant album, which pumps with blood as bright and oxygenated as its red cover text. Freed from the occasionally sentimental and over-sumptuous backings of recent Bad Seeds albums, Cave and Ellis stalk off into a wilderness fringed with cyberpunk detritus: strange bits of production prowl at the edges of these violent songs. In its second half, the sky turns gentler as Cave ponders ageing across four ambient ballads: “I’m 200 pounds of packed ice / Sitting on a chair and in the morning sun” is as good an image for the inevitability of death as you’ll find. Read the full review. BBT One of the most proudly queer pop records ever released, where sex isn’t veiled in metaphor but detailed right down to where the ejaculate lands. Lil Nas X writes wittily about lust and witheringly about his rivals, but there are also frank admissions of loneliness and doubt as he navigates his way into the lasting fame that is assured by his stunningly good top line melodies. Read the full review. BBT Michelle Zauner (pictured above) weaves beguilingly strange fantasies of how fulfilment might look throughout her third album as Japanese Breakfast. The rapturous Paprika considers how it would feel to “stand at the height of your powers” as an artist, but other songs about desire – for other people, and for life – explore agency and submission in striking shades of grey. The musical roles on Jubilee are just as mutable, shapeshifting convincingly from New Order-era pop to the brassy filigrees of early 2010s indie, and the arrangements give Zauner space to wonder. LS The power struggle between reason and desire fuels the Philadelphia songwriter’s fourth release, which intersperses soulful swagger and forlorn blues with interludes by women describing what they mean by owning their sexuality. Sullivan’s compassion resonates in how freely her interviewees express what some might see as contradictions (threatened with a sex tape leak, the subject of Ari’s Tale shrugs, “That dick spoke life into me”). And her own songs could be righteous – Pick Up Your Feelings snaps impatiently, and she makes no bones about her own pleasure on the languid On It – but they’re also transparent about the ways that freedom and dignity don’t always look how you might expect. “I just want to be taken care of / ’Cause I’ve worked enough,” she sings on The Other Side. LS The North Shields songwriter’s second album starts with a grim image of teenage desensitisation: a chronically ill parent, snuff videos, fist fights and arrests; rinse and repeat. The forecast hardly improves across Seventeen Going Under, on which hope is elusive amid Fender’s bitter depictions of feeling trapped by political alienation and inherited bad habits. And yet the sheer force of feeling in this record – tenaciously euphoric sax a la Springsteen, tempos that bob like a featherweight boxer hungry for their shot, a reckless taste for the epic – indicates a life force that won’t be stamped out so easily, one that, going by the rabid response to the album, has mass revivifying potential. Read the full review. LS In Mdou Moctar’s world, riff and rhythm count but the solo is king. His grounding in the nomadic Tuareg style of assouf (desert blues) made him a popular option on Niger’s wedding circuit, but the guitarist breaks from convention by always doggedly following his fingertips to some place new. A decade’s worth of refinement has led to Afrique Victime, which streamlines the hooky onslaught of Moctar’s 2019 breakout LP, Ilana: The Creator, into something more well-rounded. Bassist and producer Mikey Coltun’s sequencing affords breathers between levee-breakers, giving necessary hush to introspective ballads Bismilahi Atagah and Tala Tannam, while allowing the molten psychedelia of Taliat and Asdikte Akal to sprawl. True to the music’s Saharan origins, there’s ample space here. Sometimes Mdou’s voice is barely above a whisper before the band join him in skyward invocations. Read more. Gabriel Szatan As the beginning of 2021 marked almost a full year of the pandemic, many of us were experiencing some sort of impact on our mental health. So when Arlo Parks released her debut album in January, she found herself chiming with universal concerns. Addressing issues that had been triggered or exacerbated by lives stuck inside four walls – unrequited desire, sexuality, poor body image, prejudice, betrayal and depression – Parks emerged as an empathic, comforting voice. What makes Collapsed in Sunbeams so effective is that the music is the striking inverse of her themes – light, airy, her conversational voice vulnerable and childlike. Her songs are delicately but cleverly constructed, with ear-worm choruses and generous hooks; soulful, folky tones, gentle R&B and jazzy drumming; a shimmering sea of balm-like sound beneath which lurk those lyrical depth charges. Read more. Dave Simpson Not since Britney Spears shimmied her way down a hallway dressed in school uniform has a debut single had such an immediate cultural impact: within four days of Olivia Rodrigo releasing Drivers License, the song had broken Spotify’s record for the most single-day streams for a non-holiday song; it would spend nine consecutive weeks at No 1 on the UK charts. Like Spears, Rodrigo also got her start with Disney, however, Rodrigo’s pathway to pop dominance wasn’t built on dance routines and Max Martin-penned bangers. Sour is an intimate, barbed, anxious and brilliantly crafted debut album about the butchery of heartbreak and the emotional hurricane that is being a teenager. Picture Rodrigo swooping in wearing a cheerleader outfit and Doc Martens while brandishing a baseball bat, her face still wet with tears. Read more. Alim Kheraj Dry Cleaning frontperson Florence Shaw captures a generation’s internal monologue like never before: those bitchy, distracted, utterly unmindful thoughts that a consciousness poisoned by city life and digital media is powerless to stop. Shaw doom-scrolls through her own life, yet the London band’s debut album is often breezy and full of little situation comedies; her humour given ample space by the sturdy guitar-bass-drums trio who cleave to varied strains of stoner-garage rock. Ultimately there’s a profound poetry in how her observations hang together, a reminder that something can be built from the dumb flotsam of ordinary life. Read more. BBT On Sault’s fifth album in two years, spoken-word interludes baldly state the reality of racism in the UK while lyrics tell impressionistic stories that teem with loss and hurt, knives and guns. Yet the music offers transcendence: tightly melodic, luxuriously layered, instantly memorable without being cheaply infectious. London Gangs nods to the Chemical Brothers, grainily retro R&B, X-Ray Spex, hushed nu-folk and Auld Lang Syne. Bitter Streets is soulful 60s lounge music with a tricksy beat. The exquisite title track is pared-back psychedelic soul, proggy folk, cosmic Beatles and also none of those things. If you like the sound of Nine, apologies. Sault only made it available to stream and download for 99 days after its initial June release. Back then, the group said some of them hailed from “the heart of London’s council estates”, where the majority “get trapped in a systematic loop where a lot of resources and options are limited”. The unexplained erasure of Nine feels like a way to defy that lack of agency – proof that if Sault want to tightly control the distribution of their work, that’s their prerogative. Read more. Rachel Aroesti",Arts/Music,The 50 best albums of 2021: 50-6,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/nov/30/the-50-best-albums-of-2021
12/10/2021,"This list is drawn from votes by Guardian TV writers: each votes for their top 20 shows, with points allocated for every placing, which are tallied to create this order.  (BBC Three) For some years now, Liam Williams has been blossoming into one of the sharpest observers of niche contemporary culture. In the second season of Ladhood, though, he continued to turn his gaze inward, unpicking moments from his adolescence that were critical to his development. It might just be his best work yet. What we said: By the end of series two, nothing has been resolved and nobody has grown as a person, just as the rules of sitcom demand. Liam doesn’t know what he is doing, but as a writer/performer, Williams really does. Read more. (BBC Two) Jamie Roberts’ film, covering January’s failed insurrectionist coup, had one huge advantage over most documentaries; almost everyone there was filming it. From the police officers’ bodycams to gurning selfie footage from the insurrectionists, Four Hours at the Capitol could take you right inside the terrible events of 6 January. At its most intense, when we watch a mob try to beat an officer to death, it stands as some of the most claustrophobic television ever broadcast. What we said: The underlying collective testimony furnished by Four Hours at the Capitol is that the age of Trump has not yet ended – and the true day of reckoning in the United States is still to come. Read more. (BBC Two) Now that his days as a heart-throb leading man are over, Colin Farrell can concentrate on what he does best: intriguing character work. The North Water saw him bulk up and head out to the Arctic, where he could terrify the crew of a whaling ship to impossible ends. His best performance in years. What we said: This is a well-executed adventure story to be watched by firelight, wrapped in a sweater as robust – if less blood-drenched – as the seamen’s own. Read more. (Channel 4/Amazon Prime Video) With less than 24 hours to go, Channel 4 struck a deal to show tennis sensation Emma Raducanu (who had just done her A-levels in Bromley) appearing in the US Open final. And a staggering 9 million of us tuned in to watch and weep as she and the brilliant Leylah Fernandez – herself only 19 – battled it out. A gripping night of television, and a glorious slice of the future. What we said: In a few small weeks she has improved as much as some do in years … and there is so much more to come. Read more. (BBC Two) Written by Dennis Kelly, directed by Stephen Daldry and starring James McAvoy and Sharon Horgan, this Covid two-hander certainly didn’t want for talent. A couple are, like the rest of the country, stuck inside together. And, like the rest of the country, they’ve started to hate each other. The real anger, though, is reserved for the government. As such, especially for those who lost a loved one in the first flush of Coronavirus, it was a staggeringly hard watch. What we said: “An absolute wonder.” Read more. (Netflix) The story of a century-old French gentleman thief might not have screamed “blockbuster”, but that’s what Lupin was. Updated to contemporary Paris, Lupin became a sensation this year, largely due to the juggernaut charisma of star Omar Sy. What we said: The winning combination of charismatic star and stage illusionist visuals in an iconic city setting bears comparison to the BBC’s London-set Sherlock. Where Lupin betters its English equivalent is in its effortlessly chic updating of the revered source material. Read more. (BBC One) Emily Mortimer’s retelling of Nancy Mitford’s novel could have fallen back on all the old Sunday-night TV chocolate-box tropes. Instead, Mortimer worked hard to boost both the joy and sadness of the source material. A clatteringly good watch that deserves to go down as a classic. What we said: The insistent intertwining of the pain with the laughter, instead of flattening the tale into a Wodehouse-with-women yarn, makes this adaptation feel like a classic in its own right. It is a treat for all. Mitfordians – please, do give it a chance. Read more. (HBO/Sky One) Not only did The Flight Attendant start with one of the best premises of the year – an alcoholic comes to with a murdered man in her bed – but it was inventively, breathlessly told, and held together by an all-time great performance from Kaley Cuoco. What we said: The premise is fun, the execution is slick and the action is fast and relentless (it only really pauses to let Cassie top up her blood-alcohol level or call her straight-arrow brother to assure him that she’s sober and will be home on time). Full of style and brio. Read more. (Netflix) Destined to be overshadowed by its fellow South Korean export Squid Game, Hellbound was far greater than the sum of its parts. A drama about demons who come to Earth and drag people to the underworld, Hellbound was much brainier – and more satirical – than you would imagine. And dark. So dark. What we said: Although the “here’s when you will die” hook is lifted straight from The Ring, tonally it has much more in common with The Leftovers and The Returned, shows that shone a light on the fragility of the human experience that reminded us that it doesn’t take much for everything to fall apart completely. Read more. (BBC Four) If you were worrying that Scandi noir was going to be outpaced by the dubious charms of the true crime fad, relax. This series about a real-life missing girl from the 1980s managed to combine the style and drama of Wallander with the queasy complicity of contemporary crime shows. What we said: It’s not the tortured psyches of the detective that are of most urgent interest here. Like series Mindhunter, which dramatised the founding of the FBI’s Behavioral Science Unit, this takes the familiar “case of the week” structure from police procedural thrillers and applies it to a serious-minded study of forensic psychology. Read more. (Netflix) It’s hard to know what was more impressive about Inside: the fact that Bo Burnham wrote, performed, directed and edited the whole thing by himself, the fact that it was simultaneously funny, inventive and gut-wrenchingly sad, or the fact that he was only 29 when he made it. Future generations will see Inside as the definitive document of the Covid lockdown. What we said: It is a comedy Gesamtkunstwerk, a journey to the nerve-centre of the quarantined entertainer’s mind, a son et lumière Robinson Crusoe musical for the age of not just social but digital isolation. It could be a breakdown – or it could be the pandemic’s wildest gift to comedy. Read more. (BBC Two) Ryan Murphy’s series about New York City’s African American and Latino LGBTQ+ and gender-nonconforming drag ball scene was already an important show. But in wrapping up the story, Pose became an out and out celebration of an under-represented demographic. It’ll be missed. What we said: Its version of revolution always included bettering the bleak truth through sheer force of imagination. And so, this show has offered up the happy ending that real life so cruelly denies. Read more. (Amazon Prime Video) Just when it looked as if he had ossified into an obnoxious pub bore, Jeremy Clarkson suddenly went and became charming. In Clarkson’s Farm, we saw him trying his hardest to make profit from his land, aided by employees who don’t care a jot for his celebrity. If the success of this first series doesn’t go to his head, Clarkson’s Farm will be a highly successful reinvention. What we said: To watch Clarkson’s Farm is to watch a man realise that the hobby he seemingly picked up for a lark is exhausting and all-consuming and increasingly unlikely to bring any real rewards. The show, like the job, has all the hallmarks of a labour of love. Read more. (BBC Two) A five-part retelling of the last time Labour got anywhere even close to power, Blair and Brown was the document New Labour deserved. And, just maybe, that British voters deserved as well. What we said: It is an inside job, with Labour veterans as unreliable narrators. Brown’s speechwriter Douglas Alexander even says: “They were literally the Lennon and McCartney of British politics.” Rubbish. They were more like Wham!, with no George Michael and two Andrew Ridgeleys. Read more. (BBC Two) The US had The Last Dance, an all-out spectacular retracing a vital moment in time for a figure who once arguably counted as the biggest name in all of sport. In the UK, we got a documentary about snooker. The amazing thing, though, was that this might have actually been better. What we said: You cannot fail to be captivated by archive footage of Jimmy White spinning a ball around a table before, suddenly, decades later, the same man is in a hotel room telling you exactly how much of his winnings he spent on crack. Read more. (BBC Two) By its third series, you pretty much know where a sitcom will go. That’s true of Motherland, which barely attempted to deviate from its formula of middle-class mums being horrible to each other. But why bother when the blueprint is so good? What we said: Motherland is at its best when it is skewering what it knows: the snobbery, hypocrisy and narcissism of a specific strain of white, middle-class London, plus the hellscape of the school gate. And when it is at its best, it is glorious. Read more. (BBC One) The best all-round British sitcom in years, Ghosts’ third series mined slightly more heartfelt territory than before. Not only were the phantoms fleshed out more fully, but Charlotte Ritchie’s Alison found herself yearning for a family that couldn’t quite manifest itself. As beautiful as it was funny. What we said: I’m quite pleased the old guff survived. But my worry is that Ghosts will become ruined by the exclusivity of its admission policy. Somebody, preferably somebody likable and interesting, needs to die to save Ghosts. But who? Read more. (Sky Comedy) Issa Rae’s comedy about a group of black LA girlfriends living, loving and frequently falling flat on their faces while doing both has spent five seasons deftly combining laugh-out-loud hilarity (who could forget Kelli getting tasered?) with real poignancy. Its ongoing final series has given fans a steady stream of zingers, contrasting the reality that a happy ever after for Issa, Molly, Lawrence and co is far from guaranteed. What we said: The fifth and final season of this comedy about a group of black millennial girlfriends is all about giving its fans what they want. Namely, will-they-won’t-they drama, existential crises and pitch-perfect Kelli-isms. Despite its angst, it remains resolutely fun. Read more. (BBC One) Greg Davies adapted and starred in this adaptation of the German series Der Tatortreiniger, about a man tasked with removing crime scene evidence from the homes of several guest stars. It might not be the most original premise, but when The Cleaner worked, it really worked. What we said: The Cleaner is a curious mix, attempting to balance slapstick moments, such as the brutal kicking of a pie, with pathos-laden observations about ambition and freedom. Sometimes, it works wonderfully. Read more. (ITV) A dusty old survivor like this ITV detective show always runs the risk of becoming set in its ways. Not so with Unforgotten, which this year said goodbye to its star Nicola Walker. It’s bittersweet: she was perfect in this role, but now she’s freed up to become an Olivia Colman-style megastar. What we said: Over the years, Unforgotten has turned into one of the finest shows on British television. By the time it reached its fourth series, which attracted more viewers than ever before – thanks to its growing reputation as a sure bet – it was as lean as an elite athlete. Read more. (Netflix) Once Aziz Ansari was sucked into #MeToo’s bonfire of reputations, it seemed unlikely that he would ever make more Master of None. When he did, staying behind the camera for a new series subtitled Moments in Love, it was with a completely new focus. This run concentrated on Lena Waithe’s character Denise, and was composed of still, quiet episodes that paid off stunningly. What we said: For conflicted comedy fans the solution might be to stop worrying and start watching. These 192 minutes speak more directly to the shifting status of women on screen than any public statement could. Read more. (BBC Scotland/iPlayer) The first series of Neil Forsyth’s crime thriller was a word-of-mouth hit, largely thanks to Mark Bonnar’s psychotic growl of a performance. This year’s second series lost a little of its pace, but was still as compelling as ever. Let’s all cross our fingers for a third series. What we said: Guilt is a guilty pleasure, and I won’t be missing a second of it. Read more. (Channel 4) Another one-off Covid drama, Help starred Jodie Comer and Stephen Graham as a care home worker and resident respectively. Jack Thorne’s script surged with rage at the indifference with which the care sector was left to rot as the first wave of the pandemic rolled in. There’s plenty of warmth, but you’re never allowed to forget who the villains are. What we said: Comer and Graham remain faultless to the end, and the first hour is a fine addition to the wealth of pandemic testimonies that can and must be entered into the record in any way they can be, from television drama to heart-wall monuments to official enquiries. Read more. (Disney+) Ambient Beatles? Slow Beatles? Peter Jackson’s Fab Four epic leaned into the sheer quantity of extraordinary footage at its creator’s disposal, capturing a band on the verge of dissolution but still full of heart and creative inspiration. Watching the song Get Back emerge, almost fully formed, from Paul McCartney’s fevered imagination was just one of numerous jaw-dropping moments. What we said: There are fantastic moments. Lennon and McCartney’s eyes locking as they harmonise on Two of Us; Lennon’s delighted cry of “Yoko!” as McCartney’s adopted daughter starts screaming into a microphone; and especially McCartney, casting around for a new song, idly strumming his bass and singing nonsense words, gradually settling into a rhythm and melody that turns into Get Back. It is hard not to boggle. Read more. (Disney+) Taika Waititi and Sterlin Harjo’s comedy drama about bored youths trying to make it out of Oklahoma would have been brilliant in any case. But what elevated it is its cast (and near-uniform crew) of Indigenous North Americans. There’s a cultural specificity here that felt not only authentic, but authentically funny and sweet, like meeting a daft, lovable new circle of friends. What we said: Reservation Dogs is able to lay waste stylishly to centuries of myth and misrepresentation due to one simple, crucial, innovation: almost everyone involved in the production is a Native American, offering a perspective which never panders to the often-fetishising gaze of outsiders. Read more. (Disney+) A new show starring Steve Martin and Martin Short didn’t have to try very hard; a splash of the old charm and viewers would have fallen in line regardless. The genius of Only Murders in the Building, though, was how deftly it glued its comic shtick to a rigorously tight murder mystery. Much, much better than it had any right to be. What we said: The investigation pings around with comic incompetency, from suspecting Sting (playing himself), to a bit involving a dead cat. The main event remains the unlikelihood of watching two comedy titans batting around with Selena Gomez – an enjoyable enough pairing, though it never quite transcends the clear beats of the scripts. Read more. (Netflix) Call My Agent!’s fourth season saw a change of personnel, with showrunner par excellence Fanny Herrero moving on to pastures new. With her departure came a noticeable drop in quality, but let’s be clear. A Herrero-less Call My Agent! is still Call My Agent! It was stylish, funny and star-studded, and still ran circles around most other shows. This year’s season was publicised as its last, but calm down – a fifth season and a movie are now on their way. What we said: While the much-maligned Emily in Paris offered a kind of escapism for those hankering but unable to go to the city of lights and love, Call My Agent! gives you a far more authentic immersion into French culture. Read more. (BBC One) How to create one of the most nail-biting televisual experiences of the year? Take a tense, twisty procedural plot, get Suranne Jones to fire on all cylinders as a trauma-racked action hero badass, then cram her into a ready-made environment for a claustrophobic whodunnit: a nuclear sub. What we said: Throughout, Vigil has been a rich and sometimes sickly meal. Just one of its anxiety-inducing scenarios would be enough for most dramas, but this had international conflict, political intrigue, claustrophobic horror, psychological trauma, murder, cops, romance and nerve agents thrown in and set to various clock-ticking countdowns. Read more. (BBC Two) By now you could be forgiven for taking Inside No 9 for granted. But this year, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton managed to find even greater heights. There was a Brexit episode, an episode about the uneasy relationship between fans and creators, an episode where Sian Clifford played against type twice at once. The invention here continues to be phenomenal. What we said: As writers, actors and occasionally directors, the pair have shown that they can switch from bleak domestic drama to Shakespearean light comedy to full-on horror without dropping a stitch. Read more. (Netflix) A devastating and compelling portrait of life on the poverty line in the US, starring Rylea Nevaeh Whittet, the cutest child actor in years, as Maddy, Margaret Qualley as Alex, a woman willing to do anything for her family – and her real-life mother Andie MacDowell (the strongest she’s ever been) playing her gullible, free-spirited artist mum Paula. Right up there with Squid Game for word-of-mouth hit of the year. What we said: It dramatises the precariousness of existence without a fixed abode and conjures a world rarely seen in real life or on screen. It is also good at showing the insidious forms and effects of emotional abuse without insisting that Alex be an ever-broken victim. Read more. (BBC iPlayer) Adam Curtis polarises audiences like few other documentarians. For some, he is television’s ultimate truth teller. For others, he’s an impenetrable conspiracy theorist. If you’re in the first group, Can’t Get You Out of My Head was an absolutely breathless delight. What we said: It is vanishingly rare to be confronted by work so dense, so widely searching and ambitious in scope, so intelligent and respectful of the audience’s intelligence, too. Read more. (BBC One) Now overshadowed by its finale, dismissed as anticlimactic by viewers and aggressively defended at length by Jed Mercurio, Line of Duty’s sixth series was just as tight and knotty as ever. And it absolutely pummelled everything else on television to pieces. Sixteen million people watched its final episode in May. In 2021, that’s incredible. What we said: At the risk of sounding like a mere embittered fan shouting at Johnny-come-latelies … man, you should have seen it back in the days when it was good. Read more. (BBC Three/iPlayer) Daisy Haggard and Laura Solon’s Hythe-set comedy-drama returned in just as good shape as it left us: a sad, strange tale about the reputations we cannot shake. Exquisitely observed, sensitively performed and gorgeous to look at. Who could ask for more? What we said: The show has lost none of its delicacy or nuance, nor have its makers disturbed its heart and soul – in fact, they have only added to it. Quality pum-pum all round. Read more. (Channel 4) Like Back to Life, the second series of Aisling Bea’s This Way Up improved on its first. This time, as well as focusing on the recovery of Bea’s character Aine, the show was also bold enough to tackle Covid as a storyline. The fact that it was almost entirely alone in making the subject work with this little distance makes it doubly worthy of praise. What we said: The best thing of all about This Way Up is that we don’t know what is going to happen next. Bea’s is such a nuanced, delicate portrait of mental health that Aine is neither a one-note self-sabotager, or manic, or depressive. She is a real person and, as such, she could go anywhere or do anything depending on when and if her circumstances change. Read more. (Disney+) The Marvel Cinematic Universe’s first real extension into television could have gone horribly wrong – and, indeed, the shows that came afterwards prove that much is still to be mastered in that area – but WandaVision was a delight from start to finish. By basing each episode on a sitcom from a different era (for reasons that do make sense at the end, honest), this was Marvel reassuring us that it reveres television as much as it does comics and film. The most unexpected love letter of the year. What we said: It’s all deliciously, confidently, stylishly done. The parodies are fantastic fun, the jokes are great, the performances are wonderful, and it has the glorious air of something shaped by people who know exactly what they’re doing, where they want to go and how they’re going to get there. Read more. (Channel 4) A sitcom about an all-female, all-Muslim punk band, We Are Lady Parts is the sort of show a cynic might write off as tokenistic. Until they actually watched it, that is, because Nida Manzoor’s comedy was exactly that; a silly, giddy half hour that was actually designed to make people laugh. The band’s song names – Voldemort Under My Headscarf, Bashir With the Good Beard – were just a glorious bonus. What we said: We Are Lady Parts is an assured mix of second-generation cultural confusion and millennial feminism, one part Chewing Gum to two parts Wayne’s World. Read more. (Apple TV+) What else is there to say about Ted Lasso? Its achievements are already numerous – it’s funny, warm-hearted, wildly celebrated and it made people actually want to watch Apple TV+ – and yet you sense that more is to come. The first season was an unexpectedly sweet fish out of water comedy, the second dug a little deeper into the compulsions of its characters. What on Earth will a third do? Initiate world peace? What we said: The broadening and deepening must have felt like a risk to everyone involved in a show predicated on bringing light comic relief to viewers, and which then became frankly essential to their mental wellbeing. But it’s paid off. They shot and they’ve scored. Read more. (Amazon Prime Video ) Director Barry Jenkins’ harrowing, bravura adaptation of Colson Whitehead’s award-winning novel about slavery, which turned the networks that smuggled enslaved people to safety in the north into a literal train network with stations hidden in the homes of sympathetic white folks. Scene for scene, this was some of the most visually staggering television in years – and a rare show that was impossible to binge watch. What we said: An extraordinary adaptation – hallucinatory, magical, allegorical and yet permanently in the pursuit of historical and eternal truths, the resurrection of lost perspectives and the uplifting of unheard voices. Watch it, but slowly, one complex, virtuosic, heartbreaking episode at a time. Read more. (BBC One) Following his Small Axe anthology series last year, Steve McQueen returned with a documentary that dug much deeper into a subject that underpinned many episodes. Uprising told the story of the 1981 New Cross fire, carefully setting it in political context, then unleashing the horror of a crime that took 13 Black lives, then refusing to back down from its consequences. Unbelievably powerful. What we said: To watch this knowing the horrors to come is almost unbearable, but it has a clear-headed determination to show the real, full, human lives of the people who died. Read more. (Channel 4) In its third series, Jamie Demetriou’s sitcom remained as riotously silly as ever – witness the tender song about eggs Stath sings to his newborn child – while mining the characters for a deeper vulnerability. There were moments of unbearable sweetness nestled among the idiocy this year, and the thought of a life with no more Stath is almost too much to take. What we said: Stath is not a show designed to assess the state of the nation, or dive deep into a dysfunctional psyche, but to make people laugh: the clothes are funny, the situations are funny, the speech patterns are funny, the relationships are funny. Read more. (Netflix) In its second outing, Tim Robinson’s absurd comedy sketch show scaled new heights of surreal, laugh-out-loud greatness. Its meme-friendly skits somehow managed to cram subplots into scenes shorter than most ad breaks, often managing to draw belly-laughs through cleverly wrong-footing the viewer. At its best, it felt like it was reinventing what a sketch show should be in the internet era – and it was often at its best. What we said: In its second season Robinson and his co-stars pulled at the threads of their gags almost to the point of unravelling the very sense of them – and it left viewers astounded at their capacity to create hilarity from increasingly outrageous situations. Read more. (BBC One) In New Zealand comic Rose Matafeo’s lovable romcom, her character Jessie is having a strange old time living in London, with a titchy flat, tedious jobs – and the fact that she can’t stop bumping into a movie star named Tom Kapoor (Nikesh Patel) that she had a one night stand with. What we said: It was basically the 2021 version of Notting Hill, and – gladly – like the 90s, all the meet-cutes happened in real life rather than in the ninth circle of dating app hell. At just over 20 minutes an episode, it was a sweet, gentle, moreish confection that could have easily stretched to more than its six episodes.

12/10/2021,"Dune reminds us what a Hollywood blockbuster can be. Implicitly, the message of Denis Villeneuve’s fantasy epic, written again and again in the sand, is that big-budget spectaculars don’t have to be dumb or hyperactive, that it’s possible to allow the odd quiet passage. Adapted from Frank Herbert’s 60s opus, Dune is dense, moody and quite often sublime – the missing link between the multiplex and the arthouse. Encountering it was like stumbling across some fabulous lost tribe, or a breakaway branch of America’s founding fathers who laid out the template for a different and better new world. Timothée Chalamet plays Paul Atreides, your archetypal hero, unsure of his powers and questioning the merits of the mountainous task before him. His father, the Duke (Oscar Isaac), has been handed stewardship of the desert planet Arrakis, source of a magical substance called “spice” that extends life and fuels space travel – all the good stuff. But Arrakis, though sandy, is not entirely deserted. It is home to vast worms that can rise up with little warning, and an oppressed people – the Fremen – who see the spice harvesters as exploiters.  The drama is played out with relish by an ensemble cast (Stellan Skarsgård, Josh Brolin, Rebecca Ferguson, Charlotte Rampling, Jason Momoa), and Villeneuve is confident enough to let the temperature slowly build before the big, operatic set-pieces eventually break cover. He has constructed an entire world for us here, thick with myth and mystery, stripped of narrative signposts or even much in the way of handy exposition. He has handed us a movie to map out at our leisure and figure out on the run: apparently spitting on someone is a gesture of respect on Arrakis, while walking sideways like a crab is the safest way to proceed. After that we’re on our own, wandering in the desert, wonderfully immersed. It’s a film of discovery; an invitation to get lost.",Arts/Film,"The 50 best films of 2021 in the UK, No 6: Dune",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/10/the-50-best-films-of-2021-in-the-uk-no-6-dune
12/10/2021,"Nine – the fifth album in two years from the very prolific, technically anonymous and stunningly talented collective Sault – begins with a laugh. Unsurprisingly, for a record about fear, pain and trauma on the streets of London, it is a hollow one: a chorus of schoolchildren paying lip service to the concept of joy, their laboured, mechanical chuckling cut loose from a specific source. The effect is evocatively sad and bitterly satirical – especially after Nine’s primary theme, the way young people’s lives are marred by gang violence in the capital, becomes clear. But the sound is also hypnotic and strangely soothing. Or perhaps there’s nothing strange about it. “Laughter heals all that’s torn,” went the opening track of Sault’s last album, the Mercury-nominated Untitled (Rise). Social injustice, structural inequality and headline-dominating racist violence: these are the subjects recent Sault albums have revolved around (the 2020 killing of George Floyd by a white police officer was repeatedly referenced on their third, Untitled (Black Is)). Much of the group’s lyrical content seems intended to disturb, a way to jolt white listeners out of complacency. But it’s not just condemnation – songs provide consolation too; they are also rallying cries for change. On Nine, spoken word interludes baldly state the reality of the situation – on Mike’s Story, a man called Michael Ofo recounts hearing the news of his father’s murder as a child; on Light’s in Your Hands, an unnamed speaker remembers fearing gang violence would suddenly break out on his way to school – while lyrics tell impressionistic stories that teem with loss and hurt, knives and guns.  The hope and the transcendence comes mainly from the music itself, which is as beautiful and as right as the world Nine depicts is frightening and wrong. Tightly melodic, luxuriously layered, instantly memorable without being cheaply infectious, it’s also gratifyingly hard to categorise – more so than on the outfit’s previous funkier outings. Genre-blending-and-bending is de rigueur these days, but not the way this lot do it: songs are puzzles, addictive in their unsolvability, a perfect balance of mismatched elements. London Gangs alone nods to the Chemical Brothers, grainily retro R&B, X-Ray Spex, hushed nu-folk and Auld Lang Syne. Bitter Streets is soulful 60s lounge music with a tricksy beat. You From London pitches Little Simz’s psychogeographical bars up into chipmunk mode over a track crafted from seconds of melody from the beautifully maudlin Bugsy Malone song Ordinary Fool. The exquisite title track is pared-back psychedelic soul, proggy folk, cosmic Beatles softened around the edges, and also none of those things. It is unclear how many people it takes to make a Sault album, but in this specific case the major players seem to be north London producer Inflo and his partner, west London singer Cleo Sol (the American voices of previous records are largely absent here, except to laugh uproariously at English teeth and weather in the brilliantly droll You From London). The briefest of glances at Inflo’s CV explains the group’s multi-stylistic mastery. He started out working with the Kooks, and still mixes indie (Belle & Sebastian, the Snuts) with pop (Tom Odell, Adele’s 30) and rap (Little Simz, to whose work he brings a tactile, staunchly un-synthetic quality that is also present on Nine). He can make songs sound classic – he worked with Michael Kiwanuka on the timelessly beautiful Cold Little Heart (AKA the Big Little Lies theme) – or fizzingly new. If he doesn’t become one of this country’s most celebrated producer-songwriters very soon, it will only be because of his aversion to publicity. On that note: if you like the sound of Nine, apologies. Sault only made the album available to stream and download for 99 days after its initial June release (now, the only way to legitimately listen is to buy it on vinyl). Quite why the band decided to remove this historically great album from the internet isn’t clear. It doesn’t seem like a way to generate hype via scarcity-principle gimmicks – especially seeing as you can still hear it unofficially on YouTube. Perhaps it’s a protest against streaming platform dominance, a way to get people to comprehend the value of an artist’s toil. What the record’s disappearance does, however, is act as a reminder that Nine is not in fact public property. In a now-deleted Instagram caption about the album, the group said some of their members were from “the heart of London’s council estates”, where the majority “get trapped in a systematic loop where a lot of resources & options are limited”. The unexplained erasure of Nine feels like a kickback against the lack of agency foisted on those who grew up in such circumstances. It is an act of defiance – proof that if Inflo and Sol (and any other interested parties) want to tightly control the distribution of their work, that’s their prerogative. This precious, deeply personal and lovingly crafted album hasn’t gone away. It’s with those it really belongs to: the musicians who made it.",Arts/Music,"The 50 best albums of 2021, No 6: Sault – Nine",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/10/the-50-best-albums-of-2021-no-6-sault-nine
12/10/2021,"Checks on the private rented sector are in “chaos”, the chair of the Commons public accounts committee has said, after the government’s spending watchdog found squalid homes are costing the NHS £340m a year. Nearly 600,000 private rented homes in England, about 13%, have been classed as a serious threat to health and safety, according to the National Audit Office (NAO), while nearly a quarter are “non-decent”.  The watchdog said the findings were “concerning” and added that Michael Gove’s Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities did “not yet have a detailed plan to address the problems that renters face” and lacked understanding on problems plaguing some private tenants, such as harassment and eviction. Evictions are returning to close to pre-pandemic levels and this week, the renters’ group Generation Rent estimated that at current rates, 83 households will be evicted in England and Wales every working day, including 28 renter households thrown out through the “no fault” eviction process that the government has said it would ban. It is calling for a “winter truce”, repeating the evictions ban during earlier waves of the Covid pandemic. Private tenants face a “postcode lottery” over the standard of their homes, said Meg Hillier, MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch and chair of the chair of the public accounts committee. “It’s often society’s most vulnerable who suffer the most,” she said. “The department’s approach to regulation has been piecemeal.” There are more than 4.4m privately renting households in England, and their homes are more likely to be classified as “non-decent” than social housing or owner-occupied homes. Separately, councils have said there has been an increase in landlords selling up or converting long-terms rentals into Airbnbs for short lets, causing housing waiting lists to lengthen, more people to lose their homes, and making it more difficult to find permanent accommodation for those in need. Hillier said the government needed “to bring some order to the chaos and set out a clear vision for the private rental market and ensure that the growing number of tenants whose only prospect of long-term housing is in the private rented sector are better supported”. The NAO found that some households faced discrimination, with an estimated 25% of landlords unwilling to let to non-UK passport holders and 52% unwilling to let to those on housing benefit. Krystalrose Shirley, 27, a private renter who lived with her three-year-old daughter for two-and-a-half years in a mould-ridden flat in north London, said: “Emotionally and physically it affected me and my daughter in every single way. There was a period when I was afraid to turn on my light in my bedroom because I was afraid of the mould. I would spend all my time in the kitchen to not breathe in the toxins. There were mushrooms growing under mine and my daughter’s beds.” The landlord did not fix the problem, instead supplying a de-humidifier. “This problem needs to get sorted out,” Shirley said. “So many people are suffering in silence.” Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said: “The proportion of private renters living in properties that are unsafe or fail the standards for a decent home is concerning. The government relies on these tenants being able to enforce their own rights, but they face significant barriers to doing so.” Ben Beadle, chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association, said regulation needed to focus better on “rooting out criminal and rogue landlords who bring the sector into disrepute”. He called for a more strategic approach and criticised “a proliferation of initiatives such as licensing, banning orders and a rogue landlord database with little evidence to show they are working”. Jack Wagstaffe, branch chair of Acorn, a community union in Newcastle, said: “What we see all the time is that properties aren’t in a liveable state, but nothing is being done through official channels, which is why we operate.” Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said people calling the housing charity’s emergency helpline “feel powerless to challenge their landlord. In the worst cases they end up homeless,” she said. “We predicted the pandemic would trigger a rising tide of evictions and our services are starting to see the reality of this.” The government has delayed a white paper on private renting, that is expected to include the end to no-fault evictions, until next year. It was originally expected this autumn. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities has been contacted for comment.",News/Society,"Squalid privately rented homes cost NHS £340m a year, regulator finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/10/squalid-privately-rented-homes-cost-nhs-340m-a-year-regulator-finds
12/10/2021,"Thinking of throwing a boozy office party, a potential super-spreader event in the teeth of a Covid storm? Then knock yourself out, is the official advice from a government accused of being only too willing to open a celebratory bottle itself. Just don’t, whatever you do, enter the office to actually do some work. The Omicron variant has finally prodded Boris Johnson into adopting his fallback Covid Plan B, and what a classically Johnsonian plan it is; contradictory, rushed and shrouded in murky allegations. From Monday, everyone who can should work from home, but the prime minister wants office bashes and school nativity plays to go ahead. There will be vaccine passports for entering big venues, but no masks in pubs and restaurants.  If these compromises were meant to placate freedom-loving Tories, they failed; backbenchers threatening to rebel en masse were only further incensed when Johnson hinted he was considering making vaccination compulsory. That his own health secretary, Sajid Javid, promptly said this would be unethical indicates how carefully that idea had been debated inside cabinet before being tossed out, seemingly on the hoof. The kindest explanation for the chaos is that Johnson was distracted by his wife, Carrie, going into labour, as he careered from parliamentary showdown to Covid press conference on Wednesday. But even some of his own backbenchers are no longer willing to be so charitable, publicly accusing him of playing games with public health to distract attention from the now notorious Christmas party allegedly held in Downing Street during last year’s lockdown – just one of around half a dozen assorted leaving dos and other soirees alleged to have taken place when socialising was banned last year. Downing Street has repeatedly denied any rules were broken on its premises but only 9% of voters believe them, according to a poll for Sky News; meanwhile, genuinely necessary public health measures are unfortunately tarnished by association with the prime minister. Most people will rightly still obey the new rules, as they always have, for fear of infecting loved ones. But the corrosive suspicion lingers that, as Michael Kill, the dismayed chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association suggested, hospitality might have been thrown under a bus “for the prime minister to save his own skin”. Just as his magic rubbed off on Conservatives in the good times, now the muck splatters across everything he touches. Watching a distraught Allegra Stratton gulp her way through her resignation statement this week, you could see this effect unfolding in plain sight. A little over a year ago, she was best known as the aide responsible for artfully polishing the halo of the squeaky-clean chancellor Rishi Sunak. Then she was poached by Downing Street to do something similar for Johnson, hosting the televised briefings he briefly considered holding but ditched shortly after she arrived. It was while rehearsing for this job which she never did that Stratton was filmed giggling through questions about a party she says she never attended. On Wednesday, she looked genuinely broken, as if realising for the first time what had become of her. Whether he knew about the parties or not, the charge against Boris Johnson is that he’s responsible for creating a louche and reckless culture in which anything seemingly goes but all too often those who follow his lead get burned. The former Treasury permanent secretary Nick Macpherson this week tweeted the same lines from The Great Gatsby that have been echoing in my mind all week, about a gilded set who “smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness”, leaving others to pick up the pieces. The question is whether Johnson’s apparent willingness to throw his own team under the bus, by suggesting he had been misled about what happened inside his own building, finally encourages some of those helpful others to cut their losses. Why do Tories keep metaphorically jumping into bed with him, knowing how it invariably ends? Some assume they can control him, as Dominic Cummings seemingly did, calculating that he would get Brexit done and could then be ousted. A few imagine that they can change him. Others are under no illusions but consider the trade-offs worth it, for now: a briskly transactional category covering many MPs who voted for him as leader. And it’s on their constantly shifting calculations that much depends. If Downing Street had given straight answers from the start, Christmas parties might be ancient history by now. But the focus would have merely shifted to the Electoral Commission fining the Conservative party over its role in trying to get donors to fund a makeover of the Johnsons’ private flat, and a curious discrepancy between details in that report and what Johnson previously told Lord Geidt, the independent adviser on ministerial interests, about the renovations. If not that, it would have been fresh allegations that during the chaotic British evacuation of Afghanistan either Boris or Carrie Johnson controversially intervened to help get the animal rescuer Pen Farthing and his menagerie out of Kabul, which Downing Street has also previously denied. It’s no longer just about whether voters care, but whether MPs sent out publicly to defend the line can look themselves in the mirror. The Conservative party must ask itself whether it is content to keep being humiliated like this by its own leader or whether, like a long-suffering mistress tired of spending weekends alone, it can finally summon the self-respect to break free.

12/10/2021,"Following a small hiccup in launch preparation a few weeks ago, the James Webb space telescope is again making progress. Now scheduled to lift off from Europe’s spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, on 22 December, technicians there have finished fuelling the telescope.  This is a delicate operation, which took 10 days, because the hydrazine fuel is highly toxic – the whole thing had to be supervised by a skeleton staff of experts who each wear a self-contained atmospheric protective ensemble, or “scape” suit. The Webb now holds 159 litres of hydrazine and 79.5 litres of dinitrogen tetroxide oxidiser, which improves the efficiency of the fuel when burnt. Webb will use the fuel to help guide it to its operational orbit, about a million miles (1.5m km) away from Earth, to maintain this orbit and to repoint the telescope. Now the telescope must be secured to the Ariane 5 rocket and then fastened inside the payload fairing that will protect it during its ascent through the atmosphere. Once in space, Webb, a collaboration between Nasa, the ESA and the Canadian Space Agency, will be the largest space telescope ever launched.",News/Science,James Webb space telescope fuelled for launch,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/dec/10/james-webb-space-telescope-fuelled-for-launch
12/10/2021,"The rent university students pay for halls of residence has risen by 60% over the past decade to reach an average of £7,347, surpassing the reach of the average student maintenance loan, a survey shows. A survey of nearly 500,000 beds in student halls shows that rents have been steadily creeping up, with prices 4.4% higher than last year, and 16% higher than before the pandemic. As a result, many students are forced to work part-time alongside their studies, live at home or seek help from family to make ends meet, since average maintenance loans, which are also intended to cover living expenses, are £6,900.  The report from the National Union of Students and housing charity Unipol warns that the cost of rent for student rooms is rising far more rapidly than inflation, that there is a growing scarcity of genuinely affordable rooms and that choice is narrowing as private halls providers, which now operate the majority of student housing, focus on offering luxury studio apartments, often aimed at international students, rather than cheaper alternatives. London is especially unaffordable for students, with average rents totalling £10,857, 61% more than the average for the rest of the UK.Hillary Gyebi-Ababio, the vice-president for higher education at the National Union of Students (NUS), said: “The affordability of student accommodation affects students’ educational experience, and also has a major impact on access and widening participation. It’s disgraceful that so many young people are priced out, either deterred or unable to apply to university, or have their options severely limited by where they can afford to live.”The report also highlighted universities’ growing reliance on profit-seeking private providers, which operated 70% of the beds surveyed. The number of beds offered by these providers has more than doubled from 142,439 beds in 2012-13 to 361,717 in 2021-22, and the report predicted this would continue since yields “continue to outperform rival opportunities in the property sector”. The report stated that bed spaces run by private operators are nearly a quarter (24%) more expensive than those run by universities, and the gap is growing as private providers tend to price themselves on the basis of what competitors are charging rather than what students can afford. For example, rent for a self-catered room in private halls costs an average of £5,157 for university-owned accommodation, £5,985 for private housing contracted by the university, and £7,264 for completely private halls. The NUS is calling for universities to keep a tighter rein on rents charged by the private halls they work with; to offer more cheaper rooms, since the most affordable accommodation – standard shared bathroom rooms – are in decline; and to support disadvantaged students with housing bursaries.",News/Education,UK students pay 60% more for halls of residence than decade ago,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/dec/10/uk-students-pay-60-more-for-halls-of-residence-than-decade-ago

Hollie Richardson Chosen by Max Sanderson During the last couple of years, I’ve found myself increasingly drawn to comedy podcasts and have spent mindless hours listening to funny people talk about all sorts. There’s a ton out there (some of which I’ve written about before) and they usually follow the same format; two (or three) funny people freewheeling for hours on end about their lives and experiences. It’s not particularly enlightening from a production point of view, but it does the job. Storytime with Seth Rogen is nothing like those podcasts. It takes the usual ‘funny people telling stories’ format and gives it the full audio storytelling treatment with scripting, music and a healthy dose of kitsch sound design. And to great effect. My favourite so far was their opener Glorious Basterds, which tells the story of how Quinta Brunson, a former Jehovah’s Witness, was forced to rethink her personal and romantic life after a chance encounter with actor Paul Rudd. It may not sound appealing, but the key to this series — like all good standup comedy — is that it’s all in the delivery. Who says the monarchy doesn’t move with the times?

But it turns out the question wasn’t quite what she thought. Her cinema colleague Dan wasn’t asking for a precis of her 20s but rather enquiring why she had come in on her day off. Although Jessie was having a terrible time of her “overseas experience”, what made Starstruck so memorable was not that it was a tear-soaked sadcom but something altogether more fantastical. Indeed, the title referred to Jessie’s biggest problem: not her low-paid jobs, her tiny east London flatshare or the fact that even the charity shop didn’t rate her clothes, but that she had slept with – and frequently found herself bumping into – a film star named Tom Kapoor (Nikesh Patel). She didn’t recognise him at first, beginning their initial booze-fuelled encounter with “do you work at the Shepherd’s Bush Superdrug?” It was basically the 2021 version of Notting Hill, and – gladly – like the 90s, all the meet-cutes happened in real life rather than in the ninth circle of dating app hell. At just over 20 minutes an episode, it was a sweet, gentle, moreish confection that could have easily stretched to more than its six episodes.  While the central premise of Starstruck was fictional, there were parallels with Matafeo’s life. She is an overachiever who started performing standup comedy as a teen and scooped an Edinburgh comedy award in 2018 with a show about her adolescent lust for Franz Ferdinand singer Alex Kapranos. She too left New Zealand for London and has connections with Shepherd’s Bush (she lived there in the mid 2010s with her then-boyfriend James Acaster). At some point, you imagine, she has probably had her own Jessie moment as she stood almost 12,000 miles away from home. Even if she hasn’t, Matafeo beautifully conveyed the sentiment of being far from everything and everyone you love and feeling like you might have made a terrible mistake, or a few. Naturally, Jessie decides to move back home, although she – and the viewer – know that this will solve none of her problems (and really, being a film buff, she should know that, as per Breakfast at Tiffany’s, “no matter where you run, you just end up running into yourself”). As in Matafeo’s standup sets, Jessie is supremely confident and a total troublemaker with a glint in her eye. Her confidence is part of what makes the series such a delight to watch, such as when she turns up for her nannying job in last night’s multicoloured sequin dress and demands that her young charges let her watch Goodfellas. She is young, spontaneous and looking for love, even if the thought of a one-night stand with a celebrity initially fills her with dread, and leads her to jump to several wrong conclusions based on Daily Mail headlines. Indeed, Matafeo and Alice Snedden’s script is loaded with the kinds of misunderstandings and awkward moments that deftly extend the “will they, won’t they?” conundrum through all the episodes. The script is also just the right side of heartbreaking, not least when Jessie describes her situation with Tom as like “[seeing] a labrador and a hedgehog who are friends”, him being the labrador in the analogy (his icy agent, played by Minnie Driver, has of course already warned him against dating “civilians”). Gladly, a second series is on the cards, a relief for those who hadn’t quite had their fill of Jessie and Tom. And for everyone who hasn’t watched it yet – whether you have an emergency contact, or you’re still waiting for your own meet-cute – it is sure to bring you nothing but joy.",Arts/Television & radio,"The 50 best TV shows of 2021, No 9: Starstruck",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/dec/10/the-50-best-tv-shows-of-2021-no-9-starstruck
12/10/2021,"The US is determined to walk Bosnia “back from the cliff” amid secessionist threats from Serb nationalists and is exploring sanctions among other options, a senior state department official has said. Derek Chollet, a senior adviser to secretary of state Antony Blinken, was speaking ahead of a meeting on Friday of the Bosnian Serb assembly, which is expected to vote on whether to begin the process of opting out of the Bosnian army, judiciary and tax system.  Such steps, called for by the nationalist leader Milorad Dodik, would represent a substantial step towards secession. There is likely to be a six-month delay before the assembly’s decisions take effect, but a vote could start a clock ticking towards a possible return to conflict. Chollet, whose formal title is state department counsellor, visited Bosnia last month as part of a diplomatic offensive by the Biden administration to address long festering problems and threats by Dodik to reconstitute a Serb armed force. “We have really tried to accelerate some of our diplomatic efforts to try to walk this back from the cliff,” Chollet told the Guardian. “It’s notable that we are 26 years almost to the day since the Dayton peace accords were signed and there’s talk of potential return to conflict or a major crisis with Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is deeply concerning to us.” During the war, the Bosnian Serb army carried out widespread ethnic cleansing, a nearly four-year siege of Sarajevo, and the destruction of the UN “safe haven” of Srebrenica. About 100,000 people were killed in the conflict. Chollet said he had handed over a letter from Blinken to Bosnia’s leaders, stressing that peace in Bosnia was a priority for the administration. “This is an issue that many people in this administration from President Biden on down have a long association with and feel very strongly about personally,” he said. As a senator, Biden supported US military assistance to Bosnia’s Muslim-led government, Blinken was on the national security council staff when the US intervened militarily, and Samantha Power, now the head of the US Agency for International Development, was a journalist in Sarajevo during the war. Chollet was an aide to the US envoy, Richard Holbrooke, and wrote a book on the Dayton negotiations. The second theme of Blinken’s letter was the threat of sanctions against political leaders who threaten the post-Dayton peace. Dodik, the main target of that threat, has declared he does not “give a shit” about sanctions, but Chollet believes they can have an impact. “I think we’ve seen some evidence that the leverage we have, that includes policies like sanctions, can be effective and trying to shape behaviour,” he said. As for the possibility of reinforcing the international military presence in Bosnia, now just a few hundred EU troops, Chollet said he did not want “to get ahead of our discussions” but added “we are exploring all options”. Diplomats who have recently visited Banja Luka, the largest town in the Republika Srpska (Serb Republic), said there was uneasiness among the business interests around Dodik about the impact of US punitive measures. Jelena Subotić, a political science professor at Georgia State University, said Dodik also had to contend with war weariness among Serb voters. “I think we should take Dodik’s secessionist threat very seriously. He has been signalling his objectives for a number of years so this did not come out of thin air,” Subotić said. “A much bigger question is if the people of Republika Srpska will follow. It is one thing to engage in nationalist rhetoric, it is another to actually pick up arms.” During the Trump administration, both the US and the EU floated the idea of ethnically based land swaps involving territory in Bosnia and Kosovo as a means of resolving regional grievances, but Chollet insisted “that’s not where we’ve been focusing on at all”.",News/World news,US hopes to walk Bosnia ‘back from the cliff’ as Serbs step up secession threat,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/us-hopes-to-walk-bosnia-back-from-the-cliff-as-serbs-step-up-secession-threat
12/10/2021,"The introduction of Covid-19 countermeasures across the UK and the rest of Europe, not to mention the US and Asia, to try to combat the spread of the Omicron variant has raised the spectre of the global economy stumbling into 2022 in a distinctly weakened state. But how big is their impact likely to be?  Employers are unlikely to panic in the run-up to Christmas, no matter how disappointed they are that customers have begun questioning spending decisions. Many firms, especially in the hospitality, retail and tourism industries, were already short of staff. A longer spell of working from home could change how firms respond, while even tighter restrictions are expected to be met with an increase in the number of firms going bust, possibly before they get a chance to make staff redundant. A recent Bank of England report found that more than 30% of UK’s small businesses were classified as highly indebted, with borrowing levels of more than 10 times their cash balances – up from 14% before Covid-19 hit. Rishi Sunak has rebuffed calls from industry bosses to bring back the furlough scheme, and rejected Labour’s demand for an increase in sick pay to support workers who test positive to the virus. However, the chancellor has hinted that steps to protect the worst-hit industries will be considered should Omicron force ministers to adopt further measures. There is a strong prospect of shops raising prices in response to the stricter restrictions. As rising cases and rule changes make going to bars, restaurants and shows less attractive, millions of households are expected to channel the money they would have spent there on purchases, at a time when restrictions mean it is more difficult to import items into the UK. Future lockdowns in some of the world most important manufacturing hubs, including China, could further restrict the number of goods coming to the UK, adding extra pressure on prices. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the emergence of the Omicron variant would slow the recovery and increase the risk of higher inflation. “It has arguably increased the upside risks to our consumer prices index inflation forecasts,” he said. Most economists believe mask-wearing in shops and working from home will do little to alter their forecasts for growth over the next couple of years. Most businesses have adapted to home working and its reintroduction will cause only minimal disruption. That means they expect the recovery to continue and the economy to climb back above its pre-pandemic level. However, plenty of businesses will be harmed by a lack of shoppers, and the January sales could prove to be a massive flop. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the impact of Omicron could be measured in lost GDP, with a cut in his estimate for growth to just 0.3% in the first quarter of 2022 compared with a previous forecast of 0.8%. It would not mark the beginning of a recession – which needs two consecutive quarters of negative growth – but would be a painful reminder of the enormous cost of the pandemic.",News/World news,How will fresh Covid restrictions affect the UK economy and jobs?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/omicron-covid-restrictions-uk-economy-jobs
12/10/2021,"Masses of ocean plastic are providing artificial habitat for otherwise coastal species, according to a new study published in the peer-reviewed journal, Nature Communications. The study’s authors observed floating water bottles, old toothbrushes and matted fishing nets. The possibility exists that species may be evolving to better adapt to life on plastic.  A decade ago, marine researchers believed coastal organisms, which evolved to live along sheltered shorelines, could not survive a trip across the inhospitable open ocean. Yet Japan’s 2011 tsunami, which sent some 300 species of Asian marine life riding durable and buoyant plastic garbage onto North American shores, disproved that assumption. Now, researchers have a term for these drifters: “neopelagic communities”, seafaring colonies of anemones, brittle stars, shrimp, barnacles and more, which are thriving on plastic in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and washing up wherever the currents take them. Ocean plastic is “… creating opportunities for coastal species’ biogeography to greatly expand beyond what we previously thought was possible”, Linsey Haram, a research associate at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center and coauthor of the study, said in a release. The concept of organism-encrusted plastic may sound like the story of ocean species triumphing in spite of human folly. But that’s not quite the case, explains Juan José Alava, PhD, an expert in marine ecotoxicology and conservation at the University of British Columbia. In addition to transporting non-native species to delicate habitats where they may become invasive and destructive, neopelagic communities are “basically an ecological trap” says Alava. That’s because the sheer density of plastic in the ocean (researchers expect 600m metric tons of garbage will collect in the ocean by 2040) leads to the creation of permanent floating structures, covered in small species that attract creatures higher up the food chain, such as fish, turtles and mammals. When these creatures enter garbage gyres seeking shelter and food, they run a high risk of eating and/or becoming caught in plastic and dying. “For example, often the calves of whales, they are very curious – but that curiosity could lead them to get entangled and die,” says Alava. While scientists have found some types of bacteria are able to break down hydrocarbons in plastic, thereby cleaning up garbage, it’s unlikely that the types of filter-feeding invertebrates thriving in neopelagic communities will have any such effect. “The 2021 UN report after Cop26 was clear that the scale of rapidly increasing plastic pollution is putting the health of all the world’s oceans and seas at risk,” says Alava.",News/US news,"Coastal species are forming colonies on plastic trash in the ocean, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/09/coastal-species-are-forming-colonies-on-plastic-trash-in-the-ocean-study-finds
12/10/2021,"Britain’s inactivity crisis requires a new minister for sport, health and wellbeing, a House of Lords committee has argued, with the Department of Culture, Media and Sport having presided over an “uncoordinated and fragmented” strategy that failed to deliver change. A new report by the Lords’ sport and recreation committee says that powers should be removed from the DCMS and transferred to the Department of Health and Social Care to combat growing levels of inactivity in England. It comes as Sport England’s Active Lives Children and Young People survey reports 94,000 fewer children were active in the academic year 2020-21 than before the Covid-19 pandemic.  The committee says a new “national plan” for sport and physical activity should join up plans across government but that the importance of physical activity should also be put on a new footing. Among the recommendations are an obligation for councils to maintain leisure facilities and for PE to be made a core subject on the national curriculum. Schools should also be required to work with grassroots sports clubs and enable their facilities to be used across the week and outside school hours, the report says, while any reorganisation must come with greater funding from the Treasury. The authoritative Active Lives study for adults was released in October and recorded a headline decline of 700,000 fewer active people in 2020-21. A separate report into children and young people, published on Thursday, found numbers steady on the year before but with no bounce-back in activity from the initial impacts of the pandemic. Both reports found the greatest declines in activity to be among the most socially disadvantaged. “The pandemic has made abundantly clear the pressing need to get the country fitter and more active,” said Lord Willis, chair of the sport and recreation Committee. “However, participation in sport and recreation is flatlining. The Olympic legacy did not deliver the more active population we were promised, and the latest figures show activity levels have declined since the pandemic. Something needs to change and now is the time to do it. “To make the changes we need it is time for a new national plan for sport, health and wellbeing. That plan needs to be ambitious and coordinated, and carry the weight of the government and prime minister behind it. That cannot be delivered if it is led by DCMS, a small department with an increasing focus on its digital portfolio. That is why we are calling for responsibility for sport policy to move to the Department of Health and be driven by a new minister for sport, health and wellbeing.” The committee said that its members would now seek to make amendments to the government’s Health and Social Care act as it passed through the Lords, with the aim of facilitating their proposals.",Sport/Sport,Lords report calls for new ministerial role in ‘national plan’ to tackle inactivity,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/10/lords-report-calls-for-new-ministerial-role-national-plan-physical-inactivity
12/10/2021,"The fate of one of the UK’s oldest and largest mutual insurers will be decided on Friday as LV= members cast their ballots on a controversial takeover by US private equity firm Bain Capital. The deal has played into a larger debate about the takeover of British companies by private equity and raised concerns among campaigners about the dwindling number of member-owned businesses in the UK.  We take a look at the controversy surrounding the sale of the 178-year-old insurer formerly known as Liverpool Victoria, which was founded to cover burial costs for Liverpool’s poor. Why is LV=’s leadership recommending the Bain deal? LV=’s leadership insists that the £530m deal is in its members’ best interests and will secure much-need capital meant to help invest in technology and avoid being squeezed out by larger insurers. The firm said it was struggling to raise money due to restrictions on fundraising imposed on mutuals, linked to a cap on their debts. Why is the Bain takeover controversial? Members, campaigners and politicians are concerned that transferring power to an American private equity firm will put an emphasis on short-term profits, at the expense of customer service and returns for members. They are also concerned that private equity firms like Bain often insist on job losses or cost-cutting to achieve higher returns. The Association of Financial Mutuals has also alleged that there is a conflict of interest for the chief executive and chair of LV=, who have a duty to look after members’ interests but have an interest in continuing to work for the business after the Bain takeover. However, Bain has not published any details of its plans for executive pay, and LV= has said there are no contract discussions between leaders and the private equity house. What does it mean for the future of mutuals? If members vote in favour of the deal, it will mean losing one of the oldest and largest member-owned businesses in Britain. Few mutual giants remain in the UK, aside from supermarkets-to-funeral service Co-op Group and Nationwide Building Society. What were the other options? LV= said it had considered 12 offers in total after it put itself up for sale in summer 2020, including from Bain and from rival mutual Royal London. Royal London offered a higher bid of £540m, but LV= said the deal would not cover liabilities linked to the with-profits fund, and included “less certain” administration and investment costs. LV=’s board said it concluded that Bain’s bid offered greater value to members and would result in “greater and more certain pay-outs to members, on a more accelerated basis”. However, politicians and campaigners have claimed that the Royal London deal would have helped maintain LV=’s mutual status and allow it to remain British-owned. The Financial Conduct Authority said in October that it did not intend to block the takeover or plans to demutualise the firm, and refused to change its mind even when approached by lawyers working on behalf of two members on Thursday as part of an 11th-hour bid to put the brakes on the deal. What does the Bain deal mean for members? Bain Capital has insisted that LV= customers would “receive significant financial benefits” from the takeover and said last month that it was “committed to the long-term growth and success” of the business. However, the immediate financial benefits have been criticised. LV=’s 1.1 million members have been offered £100 each if they vote in favour of the deal, which some members have branded an “insult” and a meagre return for the loss of mutual status and the prospect of ownership by a private equity firm. Meanwhile, a further 271,000 “with-profits” members, who legally own LV=, will also share a further £101m between themselves. What will happen on Friday when members get to vote? LV=’s 1.1 million members will be asked to cast two ballots related to the takeover on Friday afternoon, following a special general meeting at 2pm that is closed to the public and reporters. The first vote will cover whether to approve the deal and will only require approval from 75% of members who show up to vote, with no quorum – meaning there is not a minimum threshold of members who are required to cast their ballot to ensure it is valid. The second – which will only take place if the first vote passes – will ask members to agree to scrap a rule requiring at least 50% of all its 1.1 million members to take part in any vote that could result in demutualising the business, and take power out of the hands of its members.",News/Business,The LV= vote on the Bain takeover: what’s at stake,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/10/lv-vote-bain-takeover
12/10/2021,"Robert De Niro is the greatest actor of his generation. So claimed the headline in a popular magazine last year, and it’s not a controversial claim. The evidence offered for this opinion was the same that’s always wheeled out when discussing De Niro’s acting: “[He] took method acting to previously uncharted levels. He got a New York cab licence for Taxi Driver, learned Italian and lived in Sicily to prepare for The Godfather Part II, put on 60lbs to play Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull, learned Latin for True Confessions and the sax for New York, New York. He was the hardest-working man in Hollywood,” wrote the journalist. For decades, this has been the general feeling about actors: the more method, the better. After all, if they don’t eat raw bison and sleep in an animal carcass (Leonardo DiCaprio in The Revenant), stay in a wheelchair and be spoonfed by the crew (Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left Foot) or lose so much weight that they start to go blind (Matthew McConaughey in Dallas Buyers Club), they’re just playing make-believe. And why should they get all that fame, adoration and money just for that? All of the above actors were rewarded for their efforts with an Oscar, and actors talking about their method efforts has become as much a part of the run-up to the Oscars as shops playing Do They Know It’s Christmas in the run-up to the holidays.  That’s the thing about going method: if you don’t talk about, no one off the film set knows you’ve done it, and what would be the point of that? Last month, Lady Gaga told Vogue that she stayed in character for a year and a half, and spoke with an Italian accent for nine months, all in service of playing her character, Patrizia Gucci, in the camp-fest House of Gucci. “It’s not an imitation, it’s a becoming,” she solemnly told the magazine. Unfortunately, all that “becoming” didn’t seem to leave her time to coordinate with the other actors about what an Italian accent is, as in the film they sound as if they come from entirely different countries. Yet talking about method acting has become a great exercise in marketing on the film circuit and Gaga is seen as a possible shoo-in for an Oscar nominations. So Jeremy Strong, who plays Kendall in HBO’s Succession, must be wondering where he went wrong. Fans of the show, which is now in its third season, have known for a while that Strong is an intense actor, one who goes “all-in” on his performances, as he has said in interviews; and the other cast members have hinted as much. Brian Cox references it in his new memoir, Putting the Rabbit in the Hat, with audibly gritted teeth. And until this week, that has worked in his favour: he won an Emmy last year and, given that his character on the show is such an intense outcast, the fact that Strong himself is so intense and so different from his co-stars made sense to the public. Until this week, when the worm turned. The New Yorker is no slouch when it comes to taking creativity seriously, so Strong must have assumed he was in safe hands when its staff writer Michael Schulman, whom he has known since 2003, turned up to profile him for the magazine. By the eighth paragraph of the article, he would have been firmly disabused of that notion. “Preening intensity” and “self-indulgent” are two descriptions that appear early on, followed by less than positive comments from his former and current co-stars: Cox describes Strong’s intensity as “a particularly American disease”, while Robert Downey Jr, not known for underplaying performances himself, says Strong “crosses the Rubicon”. The strongest comments come from his co-star Kieran Culkin, who told the journalist about Strong’s methods: “That might be something that helps him. I can tell you that it doesn’t help me.” The profile quickly went viral. Some people have defended Strong, including Jessica Chastain, who worked with him on Zero Dark Thirty and Molly’s Game, who described him as “lovely … Very inspiring and passionate about his work. The profile that came out was incredibly one-sided. Don’t believe everything you read, folks. Snark sells, but maybe it’s time we moved beyond it.” But in the main, there has been much cackling glee over the profile, a sense that the emperor’s method nudity has finally been exposed for what it is: pretentious, performative, narcissistic nonsense. “Going method” is now the catch-all term for an actor going to absurd lengths to embody a role, from Pacino pretending to be blind while making Scent of a Woman (at the end of the shoot, he allegedly wrote a note to his co-star, Chris O’Donnell: “Although I didn’t see you, I know you were great”), to Johnny Depp sleeping in Hunter S Thompson’s basement next to several barrels of gunpowder as preparation for playing Thompson in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. The original techniques were coined at the beginning of the 20th century by the Russian director and actor Konstantin Stanislavski, and refined in the US by the acting coaches Lee Strasberg, Stella Adler and Sanford Meisner at the Actors Studio, which stressed that actors should emotionally identify with their characters. It is the rare celebrated mid-century American actor who didn’t emerge from the Actors Studio, and so Cox is right to describe it as “a particularly American disease”. This led to what is probably the most famous anecdote about method acting. When making Marathon Man, Dustin Hoffman allegedly went without sleep in order to look and feel as exhausted as his character. “My dear boy,” his exasperated co-star, Laurence Olivier, said to him, “why don’t you just try acting?” Yet despite Olivier’s scorn, method-ish acting has held an especial fascination for actors, journalists and the public for decades and has become the, if not easiest, then at least the surest way for an actor to accrue respect. Forest Whitaker learned Swahili for Last King of Scotland; Nicolas Cage had four of his teeth pulled out for Birdy. (It is, by and very large, men who have been lauded for going method, partly, I suspect, because going method often involves weight gain and loss, which is a more complicated prospect for a female actor. But mainly, I suspect more strongly, because such extreme behaviours are much less tolerated from women in Hollywood than they are from men.) So where did Strong go wrong? He has never described himself as a method actor, and he doesn’t stay in character during a shoot. But he has said that he has “to believe in what he’s doing”, in other words, believe in the reality of his character. The anecdotes in the profile about depths of his commitment to a role are funny: asking Aaron Sorkin to spray him with teargas during the making of The Trial of the Chicago 7 (Sorkin declined); refusing to be in the makeup trailer with his Succession co-stars so as to better embody his character’s alienation from his family. But they’re no more silly than De Niro shaving down his teeth for Cape Fear, or Adrien Brody selling his apartment and car in order to get closer to his character, the Holocaust survivor Władysław Szpilman, in The Pianist. The profile implies that Strong is a “networker” who likes to “attach himself like a remora to famous actors”, although another way of looking at that is he’s an actor who works with other actors who sometimes like him, as in the case of Chastain. Extreme efforts at acting are only really funny when the results are bad, which is why the idea of Gaga shouting “bravo!” for nine months is so hilarious. But even Strong’s critics admit that he is very good at his job. So what’s the problem? I’m going to defend Strong here. I have even less time for pretentious actor bullshit than most, because a big part of my job is interviewing actors and, after more than 20 years of this, I have a zero-tolerance approach to actors talking about their job as though it’s a mystical artform demanding athletic levels of endurance. And seriously, what is the deal with “method acting”? Why not “method writing”, or “method interior designing”? If a novelist lived like his characters while writing a book, people would think he was insane – why laud it in actors? So when I interviewed Strong in September, my bullshit-o-meter was braced. But here’s the thing about Strong: he’s the real deal. I don’t mean he’s such a great actor, although I do think he is incredibly good, I mean he really believes this stuff. I had always assumed that method-y acting was either a performative show in an attempt to prove an actor’s depth or commitment, or frantic compensation for the actor’s inability to actually act. There is an implication in the New Yorker piece, I think, that Strong is overegging his process in order to be seen in the same lineage as his heroes, Pacino, Hoffman and, most of all, Day-Lewis. I’m not sure how you would prove someone is faking method-ish acting, any more than you could prove someone is thinking bad thoughts, but it’s impossible to spend time with Strong and not think he’s genuine. His intensity isn’t, it seemed to me, about ego; it’s about trying to be a better actor, and proof of that is that is – unlike every other method-y actor – he rarely talks about the lengths he goes to; all of those anecdotes come from those he worked with. His biggest mistake was probably being so intense on what is an ensemble show, and therefore impinging on the other actors. But De Niro surely wasn’t much fun to work with on The Godfather Part II, never mind Marlon Brando on The Godfather, and no one laughed at them. I’m not an actor, and I’ve never worked with Strong. But I can tell you, as someone who has interviewed a lot of actors, I’ve met much sillier and self-absorbed ones than him, all of whom were far worse at their job than him. Another mistake, perhaps, was agreeing to be profiled during the time of what can be roughly described as All This. It’s hard not to laugh at an actor who says, during a global pandemic, when it comes to acting, “the stakes are life and death. I take [Kendall] as seriously as I take my own life.” Actors who take themselves too seriously have never looked more absurd, especially since the start of the first lockdown, when a dozen or so of them earnestly sang Imagine to cheer up the little people. But only last month, Nicole Kidman said, as part of her publicity campaign, that she stayed in character for the whole shoot of the TV series Nine Perfect Strangers, which Strong has never said he does. So I’m not sure why what’s impressive in Kidman is laughable in Strong. Maybe there’s a feeling that Strong – unlike De Niro and Kidman – isn’t famous enough to get away with this nonsense. Maybe it’s the suggestion that – unlike Day-Lewis and Depp – he’s not handsome enough (“The hangdog face of someone who wasn’t destined for stardom,” as the New Yorker put it). Maybe it just seems too self-conscious from him, as though Day-Lewis training for three years as a professional fighter for The Boxer didn’t involve some forethought. It may just be that we still don’t know how to talk about actors. Are they great artistes or meat puppets who merely say sentences someone else has written? Do we want them to be acting or reflecting their own reality? The mockery of Strong and simultaneous veneration of other method-y actors suggests it’s an uneasy combination of the two. Fans thrilled to the suggestion – heavily played up by Bradley Cooper and Gaga – that the two of them had feelings for one another during the shoot for A Star Is Born, but were more weirded out by Oscar Isaac kissing Chastain’s arm on the Venice red carpet while promoting Scenes from a Marriage. The media and public are fascinated by famous actors’ personal lives, and that also includes how they do their incredibly well-paid jobs. So it feels a little unfair to then knock someone who answers that question in such an intense – yes – but also heartfelt way. The late critic AA Gill once wrote that to review a TV show you have to judge it by whether it succeeded in its intention, so even if you hate reality TV, if a programme is good reality TV, you give it a good review. Pretentious actors are truly unbearable.

The announcement, made on Thursday by the Central American country’s foreign ministry, also recognised Beijing’s claim over Taiwan as a Chinese province, a dispute which is at the heart of escalating tensions in the region.  “The government of the Republic of Nicaragua today breaks diplomatic relations with Taiwan and ceases to have any contact or official relationship,” said the statement issued in Spanish and English. “The People’s Republic of China is the only legitimate government that represents all of China and Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese territory.” The Taiwan government expressed “heartfelt pain and regret” over Nicaragua’s “unilateral” decision and accused the Daniel Ortega-led government of disregarding a “longstanding and close friendship” between the two peoples. “Taiwan has always been a sincere and reliable friend to Nicaragua and has long worked with Nicaragua to improve the livelihoods of its people and assist with its national development,” it said, adding that it would immediately terminate relations from its side and recall all diplomatic staff “to safeguard national sovereignty and dignity”. President Tsai Ing-wen dismissed Nicaragua’s rebuff, telling reporters: “the more international support we have, there will be more pressure from the authoritarian camp”. The Kuomintang opposition condemned Nicaragua’s move, and expressed “regret” that Beijing “continuously sought to suppress our country’s international presence”. Zhang Jun, China’s ambassador to the UN, welcomed Nicaragua’s move as being “in line with the prevailing trend of the time and people’s aspiration”.After Taiwan (formally the Republic of China) was expelled from the United Nations in 1971 and the seat transferred to the People’s Republic of China, most governments also switched their bilateral ties, many under intensive lobbying by Beijing, which is hypersensitive to any alluded or actual recognition of Taiwan. Taiwan and China have often traded accusations of using financial incentives like loans and infrastructure investment in seeking to retain or gain formal allies. On Friday China’s foreign minister Wang Yi said those still recognising Taiwan were because of dollar diplomacy and pressure from the US. The most recent transfers of recognition from Taipei to Beijing were by Solomon Islands and Kiribati, in September 2019. That decision has at least in part driven recent unrest in Solomon Islands. El Salvador and the Dominican Republic switched in 2018, and Panama in 2017, after which it saw waves of Chinese investment. Earlier this year Beijing was accused of offering Paraguay Covid-19 vaccines in return for switching recognition, which Beijing denies. Nicaragua had previously cut its 55-year-long ties with Taiwan in 1985 before re-recognising it in 1990. Now just 14 governments, primarily in the Pacific and Latin American regions, maintain formal ties with Taiwan. After Nicaragua, many eyes are now on Honduras and its newly election president, Xiomara Castro. Not all those who recognise Beijing also recognise its claim over Taiwan. The Chinese Communist party, which has never ruled Taiwan, says it is a Chinese province which will be taken by force if necessary, and that Taiwan’s leaders are separatists. Taiwan’s democratically elected government says it is already a sovereign nation with no need to declare independence. Nicaragua’s switch occurs amid deteriorating relations with the US, which is one of Taiwan’s strongest allies, despite not formally recognising it. Ned Price, a state department spokesperson, on Thursday criticised the decision by the Ortega government, which he said had no mandate after a “sham election” in November. “Without the mandate that comes with a free and fair election, Ortega’s actions cannot reflect the will of the Nicaraguan people, who continue to struggle for democracy and the ability to exercise their human rights and fundamental freedoms.” He urged democratic countries around the world to “expand engagement with Taiwan”. The CCP is hypersensitive to any acts which allude to recognition of Taiwan, and recently took diplomatic and trade action against Lithuania after its government agreed to open mutual diplomatic stations with Taiwan which included “Taiwan” in the office name. This week the US invited Taiwan delegates, but none from China, to a democracy-themed summit, prompting days of state media outrage and government propaganda declaring China was a superior democracy.

12/10/2021,"He stumbles badly, right down on to one knee, lurching me forward on to his shoulder. Will we fall? A tangled mess of limbs and hooves? He rights himself just in time. We’re OK. It was just a trip. The early winter air is in our lungs, and soon his stiff joints will loosen. He has various ailments that come with being an elderly horse, and ours has been a long partnership of more than 23 years. I know that each ride could be the last. We amble. Ears pricked forward, mane scruffy. The sky belongs to birds today. A small murmuration of starlings scuds by, then a flock of wood pigeons, surprisingly fast and agile. The noisiest of all are the jackdaws. They are everywhere.  The trees are full of them, chack, chack, chacking that hard, pinging call. Hopping from branch to branch or swooping in and out of the oak’s boughs, but always chatting and disagreeing. They live up to their collective noun: a clattering of jackdaws. On the pastures, they strut in pairs, turning over horse droppings in search of invertebrates. Jackdaws pair for life and normally stay close by each other, so it’s easy to identify the couples. One bird bounces along comically, every jump taking it inches clear of the ground. The low sunshine highlights the iridescence of its feathers, the silvery nape, and the piercing Paul Hollywood eyes. Over Chestnut Wood, a mixed flock of jackdaws and rooks flies high, taking on a different character. No longer chatty and cheeky, but mysterious and mesmerising, the group performs a rising and falling corkscrew movement. A loose vortex of birds. Occasionally, an individual breaks free of the group and plummets into a sudden dive. It’s possibly part of courtship for young jackdaws pairing up during their first autumn, or maybe just exuberance. Two decades have vanished from my horse, shaken off like cobwebs, and he is not stumbling but jogging and prancing. Sweat rises from his neck and I take my attention away from the skies and the birds, back to the art and science of not falling off. It does us both good to get out, and as the challenges of winter approach, I plan our next ride.

12/10/2021,"Australia’s competition and consumer watchdog has taken Booktopia to court over alleged false or misleading claims made to customers over their rights to refunds for damaged and digital products. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) launched proceedings in the federal court against the country’s largest online book retailer over claims allegedly made on the Booktopia website between 10 January 2020 and 2 November 2021 that customers had to notify Booktopia within two days of delivery of a faulty, damaged or incorrect product in order to be able to get a refund or other replacement options.  The company also allegedly told customers there were no refund rights on products such as digital content and ebooks in any circumstances. The ACCC has alleged the company also told 19 customers it was not obliged to provide a refund or remedy because the company was not notified about a fault with the delivery within two days of the delivery. The ACCC says those claims are false and misleading because Australian consumer law gives customers a right to obtain a refund or remedy if they don’t meet consumer guarantees, and there is no two-day expiration date. “Consumers who buy digital products or buy products online have the same rights as those who shop in physical stores,” the ACCC chair, Rod Sims, said in a statement. “Australian consumers have a right to refund, repair or replacement for goods that do not meet their consumer guarantee rights, which apply for a reasonable period, and no business can exclude, limit or modify those rights.” Sims said the ACCC was acting on the complaints made from Booktopia customers who claim they were denied a refund because they contacted Booktopia more than two days after delivery. “Consumers are not limited to a two-day period in which to notify a seller of problems with the product they have purchased,” he said. “Booktopia’s conduct may have caused consumers not to seek a refund, replacement or repair for faulty digital products, books and other goods in circumstances where the Australian consumer law gave them a right to do so.” The ACCC will be seeking a ruling from the court on penalties, declarations and costs. A spokesperson for Booktopia said the company was still reviewing the ACCC’s statements and filings. In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange earlier this week, Booktopia said the statements were “to ensure that we could confidently provide replacements, refunds and other remedies to customers” and it wasn’t intended to limit Booktopia’s obligations under consumer law. The company’s website now states that for returns on damaged or faulty items, customers should contact Booktopia “as soon as possible” from the time delivery was made. It is not the first court action the competition regulator has launched against companies over consumer rights when it comes to digital products. The federal court ordered Sony Interactive Entertainment to pay $3.5m in penalties over claiming it did not have to provide refunds for games once downloaded, or if 14 days had passed. The full federal court also ordered Valve to pay $3m in 2018 over claims that users were not entitled to refunds on games bought on its Steam games platform.",News/Australia news, ACCC accuses Booktopia of making false claims to customers over refund rights,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/10/accc-accuses-booktopia-of-making-false-claims-to-customers-over-refund-rights
