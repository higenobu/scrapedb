3/14/2022,"Morning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this morning. Diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine are stepping up with talks between the Kyiv government and Russia set to resume today. The negotiations come after a deadly Russian missile attack on a Ukrainian military base near the Polish border heightened fears about an escalating conflict and as bombing resumed in Kyiv this morning. Although the Biden administration again rejected calls from Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy for a Nato-enforced no-fly zone, his negotiators think there is some hope that Russia is “beginning to talk constructively”. In another diplomatic initiative today, the US and China will meet amid concern that Beijing could supply arms to Putin’s war machine. Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, will meet his Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi, in the Italian capital amid reports that Russia has asked China for weapons to bolster its faltering invasion of Ukraine. The human cost of the war was brought home yesterday as Ukraine announced that at least 1,300 of its soldiers have been killed so far. The horrors of the conflict have been described by Ukrainians who managed to escape westwards, accusing the Russians of shooting people dead in the street as they advance through towns and villages. Tributes have been paid to the American journalist Brent Renaud, who has been killed in Ukraine, apparently by Russian fire. The Kremlin has reportedly urged Russian media to use clips of US Fox News host Tucker Carlson on their shows because he has been critical of the US response to the war. The US faces a standoff with Saudi Arabia and the UAE over their refusal to pump more oil and bring prices down to ease pressure on western economies. Brent crude is down 3% to $109.37 this morning. A Russian default on its debts after western sanctions is not “improbable” but would not trigger a global financial crisis, the head of the International Monetary Fund said.

Refugee delays – British families trying to help Ukrainian relatives get to safety in the UK have expressed frustration at continued bureaucratic delays, despite government promises to cut the red tape involved in the family reunification scheme. One woman stuck in Budapest with her elderly parents said it was a “humiliating process”. Another refugee problem is brewing as Belarus pushes asylum seekers from the Middle East into Ukraine, according to people in Belarusian camps. The refugees became trapped in Belarus after they were promised passage to the EU to cross the border last year. Covid warning – Ministers have been accused of “turning off the headlights at the first sign of dawn” after scrapping nationwide Covid surveillance programmes, with scientists saying it will almost certainly end up costing more money in the long run. It comes as growing numbers of new infections in multiple countries led one expert to prompt speculation that Europe could be at the start of a sixth wave of Covid infections, partly driven by the “stealth” BA.2 Omicron variant. China’s government has responded to a sharp rise in coronavirus infections by shutting down Shenzhen, a huge city of 17.5 million people. It is two years since coronavirus hit the US, leaving nearly a million people dead. But as it counts the cost, is the country ready for another pandemic? Every dog has its day – The Power of the Dog, Jane Campion’s western starring Benedict Cumberbatch as a rancher in 1920s Montana, has taken the best film and best director prizes at the Baftas in London. Will Smith took the best actor statuette for King Richard and best actress was awarded to Joanna Scanlan for After Love. The Guardian documentary The Black Cop, about a former Metropolitan police officer who explores his memories of homophobia, racial profiling and racial harassment, won the Bafta for best short film. Climate protesters tried to disrupt proceedings, but Rebel Wilson ruffled enough feathers with a series of filthy jokes and 85-year-old Shirley Bassey opened the show by singing Diamonds Are Forever to mark 60 years of Bond films. And you can check out the frills and fluff of the red carpet here. Inflation crisis – The poorest households in the UK could see their cost of living jump by as much as 10% by this autumn if Russia’s invasion of Ukraine leads to a prolonged conflict, the Resolution Foundation thinktank has warned. Higher food and energy prices could drive inflation above 8% in the autumn, it warns, hitting poorer families disproportionately harder. Tenants could see a big increase in rent and bills, with research showing typical costs set to rise £1,000 this year. Bright spot – The UK’s first solar farm owned by a health board and linked directly to a hospital has exceeded expectations by providing all the electricity needed to run the site on some days. Bosses hoped the farm in south-west Wales would supply Morriston hospital in Swansea with a fifth of its energy but it provided enough energy over one 50-hour period to meet 100% of the hospital’s demands. If confirmed by the US Senate, Ketanji Brown Jackson will be the first Black woman to take a seat on the country’s highest court.

Eddie Jones believes England can exploit the pressure facing grand slam-chasing France this weekend, insisting his side have already found the winning formula against Les Bleus. Jones has questioned why Ireland were not shown a yellow card as a result of England’s scrum dominance in his side’s 32-15 loss but believes the gallant defeat – in which they played 78 minutes with 14 men – could be the making of their 2023 World Cup campaign.

The boss of BrewDog, James Watt, hired private investigators to obtain information about people whom he believed were taking part in a smear campaign against him. According to multiple sources, investigators approached people to gather evidence about those who he appeared to believe had maligned him. The brewer says investigators were hired to find the source of false allegations about Watt and as a result of those investigations its lawyers “are pursuing a private criminal prosecution for fraud and malicious communications”. On the markets, shares in China and Hong Kong are down sharply over Covid concerns, but FTSE100 futures are up 0.24%. The pound is down at $1.301 and €1.193. The Russian missile attack on Yavoriv and the implicit threat to Nato is the lead in most papers. “Russia escalates war in Ukraine with attack close to Nato border”, says the Guardian, and the FT has “Russian strike at western Ukraine base sends warning signal to Nato”. “War reaches Nato border” says the Times, and the Telegraph goes for “US warns Putin as he takes war to the West”. The i leads with “Putin strikes bring war to door of Nato”, while the Mirror has a picture of the Russian leader and the headline “The west in his sights…”. The Sun has “Putin blitz on Nato border”. The Mail says “Putin’s deadly warning to the west” and the Express goes with “Putin’s missile strike brings war to Nato’s border”. There’s an interesting angle in the Scotsman, which reports “Farmers warn Ukraine crisis and inflation could lead to food shortages”.

3/14/2022,"The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has emphasised the importance of the government’s tax cuts amid speculation about how the budget will address rising cost of living pressures. Facing calls from state Liberal leaders and National MPs to cut the fuel excise as petrol tops $2.20 a litre, Morrison said on Monday that the government was “very aware” of the strain being felt by families across the household budget. “These cost of living impacts are real, and the Australian government understands that,” Morrison said. “There is always a lot of speculation before budgets and so I will leave the government’s decisions for budget to that night…but there are many pressures on cost of living and that’s why our tax cuts are so important.” While Morrison has left open the prospect of cutting the fuel excise, which is set at 44.2 cents per litre, he said the Coalition’s focus had been on reducing the tax burden. Liberal premiers Steven Marshall from SA and Peter Gutwein from Tasmania have urged the Morrison government to cut the excise, which in 2001 was frozen by the Howard government as it faced community pressure over petrol prices. But broadening the debate over household cost pressures, Morrison said petrol was just one issue facing consumers, and pointed to the more general hip-pocket benefit of tax cuts. He said someone earning $90,000 a year was $50 a week better off than when Labor was in government after the Coalition’s changes to the personal income tax rates and the low and middle income tax offset. “By cutting taxes and our commitment to cutting taxes, that is actually helping Australians better able deal with the increases in cost of living that you see, for example, on petrol price rises.” The government has been considering an extension to the temporary low and middle income tax offset which ends in 2021-22, but there are fears the $7 billion measure could add to inflationary pressures in the economy. Last month, the treasurer Josh Frydenberg said that the tax break was introduced as a result of the economic circumstances at the time and was “not a permanent feature of the tax system.” Morrison is expected to use this month’s budget to announce a comprehensive cost of living package to take to the next election, which may also include a cut to the draught beer excise after a concerted campaign by hoteliers and the alcohol lobby that has been backed by marginal seat MPs. The change would shave 30 cents off the cost of a schooner of beer if passed on to consumers, but has been criticised as being directed towards men and at odds with health guidance. Labor has accused the government of not doing enough to address the rising cost of living, saying the Coalition had ridiculed its childcare policies and had overseen stagnant wage growth. “Families are under massive pressure - everything is going up except people’s wages,” Albanese said. “We have food, be it meat, be it vegetables, the essentials of life, are going up as well. “We know that rents are going up as well. We know that the cost of childcare is going up as well.” Albanese said the Coalition had not “done anything about petrol” which had become more expensive for consumers before the Russian invasion of Ukraine that has prompted a range of sanctions. He said Labor would wait to see what the government would do on fuel excise before making any commitments, but pledged a “whole suite” of measures aimed at addressing the cost of living. “We’ve got our own announcements coming up to deal with the cost of living,” Albanese said. Economists have warned that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine may have unforeseen consequences for the Australian economy, including ongoing inflationary pressures, with fuel forecast to reach as much as $2.50 a litre. The International Monetary Fund has warned that price shocks would “have an impact worldwide”, but particularly for poorer households for whom food and fuel are a higher proportion of expenses. On Monday, the New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern announced a halving of public transport fares and a cut to its government fuel taxes in response to what she described as a “wicked perfect storm” of global inflation that had seen petrol surge to more than $3 a litre.",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison talks up tax cuts as pressure builds on petrol prices,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/14/scott-morrison-talks-up-tax-cuts-as-pressure-builds-on-petrol-prices
3/14/2022,"About 150,000 Victorian casual workers will be eligible for five day’s paid sick land carer’s leave each year as part of a $246m Australian-first trial to tackle the “toxic” nature of insecure work. The trial, announced by the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, on Monday, has already been criticised by business and industry groups as a “handbrake” on the state’s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. The state opposition also indicated they could scrap the trial if elected in November. Under Andrews’ plan, eligible casual and contract workers will receive up to five days a year of sick or carer’s pay at the national minimum wage, which is now set at $20.33 an hour or $772.60 a week. The first phase of the two-year trial will be open to about 150,000 workers in hospitality, retail, aged and disability care, cleaning and laundry services, security and the supermarket and supply chain industries. These workers are able to apply for the leave via the government’s Service Victoria website. There are plans to extend the scheme in the second phase of the trial, details of which were not announced on Monday. Andrews said the pandemic had exposed the “completely and utterly toxic” nature of insecure work, with some casual and contract workers forced to choose between feeding their family or going to work while infected with Covid, as they could not afford to take time off. “That’s not a criticism of them, but it is certainly of the system that lets them down badly,” he said. Andrews said the expected results of the trial, including a reduction in workplace injuries and illness, general productivity improvements from healthier workers and lower staff turnover rates, would hopefully lead to support from business. “It’s appropriate that we prove this up, that we show that this actually works and that it’s just as good for business as it is for the workers, who will be able to – for the first time ever – fall back on a modest amount of pay in the event that they’re sick or they have to care for a loved one who is sick,” he said. “It’s about learning the lessons of a one-in-100 year event and making sure the economy and community is better off.” The United Workers Union, which represents many of the workers covered by the trial, welcomed the announcement and called on other jurisdictions to follow suit. “If the Covid pandemic has shown us anything, it is that casual, precarious and insecure work has ramifications for the health of the whole community,” the national secretary, Tim Kennedy, said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Let’s not squander the opportunity to make practical and positive change to ensure a better and more resilient Australia that looks after the very workers who turned up, at risk to themselves and their families over the last two years.” He said the federal government should amend the national employment standards to ensure 10 days of paid sick leave for all workers. Ruby Lethbridge, a hospitality worker and Hospo Voice member, said many casuals go to work while sick “out of fear or desperation”. “Their bosses might be pressuring them to work due to understaffing and if they say no, they fear that they could lose shifts,” Lethbridge said. “Even if the manager does the right thing and covers the shift, the worker loses the paid work, which is of course essential to pay rent and other living expenses.” In an exclusive interview with Guardian Australia published on Monday, Andrews said any ongoing scheme would be funded by an industry levy and braced for backlash from industry. “It’s not a matter of ‘can business afford to support this?’ It’s a question of ‘can all of us afford not to do this?’” he said. Within hours of the government press conference, businesses, industry groups and the opposition were describing the proposal as a “tax on employment” and a “sick-pay tax”, respectively. Tim Piper, the Victorian head of the peak employer association Ai Group, said several occupations included in the first phase – such as butchers, chefs, pastry cooks, motor vehicle salespersons and supermarket workers – could not be considered insecure. “Presumably phase two will involve an even wider set of eligible occupations and a much larger cost. These huge costs will no doubt require a very substantial levy on Victorian businesses if the government decides to pass on the costs to businesses at the end of the two-year trial, as it appears to be planning to do,” Piper said. “The scheme is deeply flawed and should be abandoned. The last thing that Victorian businesses need is the prospect of a hefty payroll levy in two years’ time to fund this illogical scheme. “The looming levy will kill investment in Victoria and put a handbrake on the recovery.” Paul Guerra from the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said casuals already received a 25% loading in lieu of paid sick leave and carer’s leave. “We don’t believe there needs to be any addition to that. Through the pandemic there was a cause to do something around that but we’re out of the pandemic now,” he said. “Let’s get back to business as usual so businesses can truly recover.” Piper and Guerra said they had raised their concerns with the scheme during consultation with the government. Restaurant & Catering Australia, Australia’s peak body for restaurants, cafes and caterers, said they were not consulted and were left “bewildered” by Monday’s announcement. The deputy Liberal leader for Victoria, David Southwick, indicated the opposition would scrap the trial if elected in November. “The main focus needs to be job security and job opportunities,” he said.",News/Australia news,"Victoria’s paid sick leave trial backed by unions, criticised by employer groups",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/14/victorias-paid-sick-leave-trial-backed-by-unions-criticised-by-employer-groups
3/14/2022,"Controversial rules on hairstyles and underwear are to be scrapped at high schools run by the Tokyo metropolitan government, after pressure from students. Almost 200 public high schools and other educational institutions will drop five regulations, including one requiring students to have black hair, from April, the Mainichi Shimbun said, citing official sources. The newspaper said rules designating the colour of students’ underwear and a ban on the “two block” hairstyle – short at the back and sides and longer on top – will also be dropped. The move comes after a survey carried out last year of 240 schools in the capital found that 216 retained regulations that an increasing number of people in education – including the children themselves – say are outdated. Some of the rules will stay in certain schools, however. While some will abolish a requirement for students to show proof that their hair is naturally curly or a colour other than black, some will keep the regulation, reportedly at the request of students and parents. Yuto Kitamura, a member of the Tokyo metropolitan board of education, said the decision to scrap the most egregious regulations was a “major step forward”, according the Mainichi. Another member, Kaori Yamaguchi, praised the move but said it had taken too long to address students’ grievances. “Japanese people have been taught to believe that it is a virtue to simply abide by the rules,” she said. “I hope this will be an opportunity for people to discuss what we should do to create a society where rules are observed in a way that’s acceptable to everyone.” The debate over strict dress codes intensified several years ago after a high school student, then aged 18, sued education authorities in Osaka after her school had told her to dye her naturally brown hair black or face exclusion. Last year, the Osaka district court rejected her claim that she had been forced to dye her hair, but said the removal of her desk and name from the roster after she stopped attending classes had been unreasonable. It ordered the board of education to pay her ¥330,000 [£2,152] in compensation. Last year, all public high schools in Mie, a prefecture in western Japan, abolished rules governing hairstyles, underwear colour and dating, with local officials conceding that the requirements were “relics” from a different age. Some schools had told students they must wear undershirts in beige, mocha or other colours that were not easily visible beneath their uniforms, while only “monotone white, grey, navy blue or black” underwear was permissible. Some students have successfully campaigned for girls to be allowed to wear trousers to school, while others have called for a lifting of bans on makeup and hair products.",News/World news,Tokyo schools cut controversial rules governing hairstyles and underwear,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/tokyo-schools-cut-controversial-rules-governing-hairstyles-and-underwear
3/14/2022,"The UK’s first solar farm owned by a health board and linked directly to a hospital has exceeded expectations by, at times, providing all the electricity needed to run the site, even during the winter months. Health chiefs and Welsh government ministers had hoped the solar farm in south-west Wales would supply Morriston hospital in Swansea with a fifth of its energy consumption every year. However, they were surprised and pleased that the Brynwhillach Farm, which is linked to Morriston by a two-mile cable, provided enough energy over one 50-hour period to meet 100% of the hospital’s demands. It is estimated that the 10,000-panel farm, which was switched on in November, has already saved £120,000 in electricity bills, and the board has on occasions been able to sell power back to the energy grid. The £5.7m solar farm was built under a loan scheme set up by the Welsh government to decarbonise the public sector by 2030. The Welsh minister for climate change, Julie James, said: “We want our energy to come from community-owned and locally run renewable energy sources in Wales. “This will ensure our supply is resilient, reliable and reasonable for both our planet and our pockets. Morriston hospital, which depends not only on the powers of its staff but also the energy-hungry machines to keep their patients alive and well, has blazed the trail.” It had been thought that when it was fully operational the scheme would cut carbon emissions by 1,000 tonnes and save £500,000 in bills annually, but with world energy prices spiralling, the board now believes the savings could be almost double that figure. Swansea Bay University health board’s assistant director of operations, Des Keighan, said: “It was expected that over the winter months the solar farm would contribute electricity, but that the hospital would still need to continue to buy power from the grid every day. “What has come as a pleasant surprise is that for a total of 50 hours, the hospital has been entirely powered by the solar farm. “This is despite the fact that the solar farm hasn’t been operating continually over the winter. It has still been undergoing tests and fine-tuning, and is not due to be completely finished until the end of March. So this additional performance has been even more of a bonus.”",News/UK news,Welsh solar farm exceeds expectations in powering Swansea hospital,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/14/wales-solar-farm-brynwhillach-powers-swansea-hospital-morriston
3/14/2022,"This week, we’re going to concentrate on an often overlooked northern constellation. Cepheus is named after the king of ancient Aethiopia in Greek mythology. Part of the Perseus myth, Cepheus is married to Cassiopeia and is the father of Andromeda, the princess whom Perseus saved from the sea monster Cetus. Cepheus is one of the 48 constellations listed by the astronomer Ptolemy in the second century. The constellation is easy to miss as it contains only moderately bright to faint stars, but its shape is distinctive once located. The brightest star is Alderamin, derived from the Arabic phrase meaning “right arm”, which means that the king is upside down on the sky, or facing away from us. The most significant star is Delta Cephei (∂ Cep). Located almost 1,000 light years away from Earth, it was observed to pulsate by John Goodricke in 1784. Such pulsating stars, called Cepheid variable stars, are now used to measure distances to nearby galaxies. The most beautiful star is the Garnet Star, so-called because of its deep red colour. The chart shows the view looking north-north-west from London at 20.00 GMT on 14 March.

3/14/2022,"The boss of BrewDog, James Watt, hired private investigators to obtain information about people whom he believed were taking part in a smear campaign against him and repeatedly accused one woman of being involved until she blocked him on social media. According to multiple sources and evidence seen by the Guardian, private investigators who said they were working for Watt approached people to gather evidence about those who he appeared to believe had maligned him. One subject of their inquiries, Rob MacKay, an ex-BrewDog employee, had appeared in a BBC documentary, The Truth About BrewDog, which made claims about the company’s workplace culture and Watt’s personal behaviour as an employer, including towards women. A former colleague of MacKay’s says he was visited at work by two ex-policemen working for a company called Integritas Investigative Solutions. “They said they’d been hired by James Watt and were serious crime investigators,” the former colleague said. “They said they’d been hired by James’s lawyers to build a case. They asked me how well I knew Rob, how I found working with him and how did it compare to experiences in BrewDog.” The men left a business card for Integritas. Integritas investigators also approached a friend of a female former acquaintance of Watt asking for details of their discussions, evidence reviewed by the Guardian indicates, after Watt became convinced that she was involved in online allegations about him that appeared on social media. The woman, who asked not to be named, also received multiple messages from Watt himself, in which he told her he had “extensive evidence from multiple sources of what you and others have been doing” and warned she could face legal action. Despite her repeated denials, he continued sending her messages by email and on Instagram until she blocked him. In June last year, BrewDog apologised to former employees who accused the company and Watt in an open letter of fostering a “culture of fear” in which workers were bullied and “treated like objects”. Members of Punks With Purpose, the group behind the letter, took part in the BBC documentary, which aired earlier this year. Watt was later accused of trying to “intimidate” people who appeared on the programme, after he issued a public warning in advance of the broadcast that they could be unmasked in court and that it was “not too late” to pull out. He disputes the allegations in the documentary and has since lodged a complaint against the BBC with media regulator Ofcom. One former BrewDog staff member in the US, who also appeared on the show, said he felt put under pressure by lawyers acting for BrewDog to retract his statements. Dylan Gray, who worked in a BrewDog bar in Columbus, Ohio, said during the documentary that he believed James Watt’s behaviour towards female employees had made them uncomfortable and that he had tried to ensure fewer women were working when he was around. Soon after the programme aired, he said, US lawyers acting for BrewDog contacted him disputing the claims and asking him to retract them. A BrewDog spokesperson said: “James Watt has been subjected to a two-year criminal campaign of online harassment, defamation, fraud, blackmail and malicious communications, instigated by a very small group of individuals. Investigators were hired to find the source of these false allegations, to seek to bring this to an end. “As a result of those investigations, our lawyers are pursuing a private criminal prosecution for fraud and malicious communications in a court in London, there are related civil proceedings under way in Scotland and other matters have been reported to the police. These proceedings also relate to individuals directly involved in the leadership of the Punks With Purpose movement. “We will no longer allow blatant lies to be told about our business or our people. Where those lies are told, we are duty bound to set the record straight and will expect retractions where required. We hope that by taking this action now, we can bring this deeply distressing campaign to an end.” Integritas said it had “uncovered evidence of a very clear criminal campaign, organised by a small group of individuals seemingly intent on causing harm to Mr Watt and BrewDog. “We conduct all our investigations with the utmost integrity,” it said.",News/Business,BrewDog boss hired private investigators to gather evidence of alleged smear campaign ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/14/brewdog-boss-hired-private-investigators-to-gather-evidence-of-alleged-smear-campaign
3/14/2022,"The poorest households in the UK could see their cost of living jump by as much as 10% by this autumn if Russia’s invasion of Ukraine leads to a prolonged conflict, a thinktank has warned, as Rishi Sunak faces mounting pressure to tackle the cost of living crisis. The chancellor will deliver his spring statement on 23 March. He is reluctant to commit to significant extra spending, but Treasury sources concede he has acknowledged the necessity to take some limited action. Options could include increasing benefits in April by more than the planned 3.1%, a new cut in the taper rate for universal credit so that claimants keep more of their earnings, or an increase in the national insurance threshold. Labour and many Conservative MPs have urged Sunak to scrap the 1.25 percentage point rise in national insurance contributions, earmarked for health and social care, but government sources insist it will go ahead as planned next month. The Resolution Foundation said the public finances look healthier than expected at the time of the autumn budget, with borrowing on course to be £30bn lower than forecast. However, the economic outlook has deteriorated significantly. At the time of the budget, inflation was expected to fall back later in the year. Instead, the Resolution Foundation said food and energy prices were likely to continue to be driven higher, pushing inflation to a “second peak” above 8% in the autumn. With the poorest tenth of households spending twice as much of their budget on food and fuel as the richest, they are likely to be hardest hit, experiencing an inflation rate of perhaps 10%. James Smith, the research director at the thinktank, said: “The chances of a living standards recovery this year are receding as rapidly as inflation is rising, and the risk of another recession is looming into view. The chancellor will therefore need to make some tough, and potentially expensive, choices in how to respond.” Separate analysis by another thinktank, the New Economics Foundation (Nef), suggests that even by April almost half of all children will be living in households that are unable to meet the cost of some basic necessities. Nef found that a third of households, or 23.4 million people, would have to cut back on some basics, such as food or heating, as their income falls short of what they would need to provide a decent minimum standard of living – typically by as much as £8,000. As many as 48% of all children will fall into households in this category, Nef calculates. Sam Tims, an economist at Nef, said: “The cost of living is increasing faster than at any point in recent history. While all families are set to feel a squeeze come April, the lowest-income households will be hit proportionately harder. There is little time left for the chancellor to take action to avert the worst real-terms incomes squeeze in 50 years.” Nef’s projections are based on the minimum income standard – the budget needed to afford what members of the public believe are essentials. It is calculated by Loughborough University’s Centre for Research in Social Policy. The consumer expert Martin Lewis said last week that some families would “simply starve or freeze” as a result of unmanageable increases in their cost of living, particularly driven by energy prices. Sunak announced measures in February aimed at cushioning the blow, as the energy regulator, Ofgem, announced that the price cap that puts a ceiling on average bills would rise by almost £700. His package included a £150 council tax rebate for properties in bands A to D, and a £200 cut in energy bills from October, to be paid back over five years. However, the scheme was predicated on energy bills falling back again from next year, something that has now been thrown into doubt. It emerged last week that the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, had been asked by Downing Street to draw up options for beefing up the scheme, though these would not be enacted until the autumn. Meanwhile, the shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, warned that rising global oil prices in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine meant the average family would spend an extra £386 on petrol in the year ahead. “This is a savage extra cost for millions of working people,” she said, renewing Labour’s call for the government to impose a windfall tax on oil companies profiting from surging prices. “The Conservatives could help working people being hit hard by soaring prices; instead they’ve rejected the choice of a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producers raking in billions. And to add insult to injury, within weeks they want to clobber families with a huge tax hike,” she added. The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, used his speech at his party’s spring conference in York on Sunday to renew his call for a VAT cut as a response to surging inflation. “The war in Ukraine has turned a cost of living crisis into a cost of living emergency.

3/14/2022,"British families trying to help Ukrainian relatives get to safety in the UK have expressed frustration and fury at the continued bureaucratic and technical hurdles involved, despite government promises to cut the red tape involved in the family reunification scheme. Applicants said they were struggling with a range of problems – such as online application forms that crash, difficulty in getting clear guidance from helpline staff, some advice hotlines charging premium rates of 69p a minute, delays in visa processing times and extended, expensive stays in hotels in unfamiliar countries with no clarity about when visas will be granted. Although the rules governing the Home Office-administered Ukraine family scheme are to change from Tuesday, removing the need for applicants to get fingerprinted before coming to the UK, about 22,000 people who have already submitted applications have been given no information about how to proceed. Several families with elderly and vulnerable relatives told the Guardian that they were concerned about the protracted delays in processing UK visas. Anna Malyna White, an interpreter from Glasgow, was attempting to bring her parents, Viacheslav Malyna, 84, and Zhanna Malyna, 82, to the UK. Both are retired civil engineers from Kharkiv, with serious health conditions, but despite attempts to flag the urgency of their situation to Home Office staff, all three have been stuck in a hotel outside Budapest since last week, unclear about whether they will need to wait until 28 March, for a scheduled biometric appointment, or if the changing rules will allow the family to travel to the UK sooner. Malyna White visited the Budapest visa application centre on Thursday to try to get clarity. “Employees are stressed. Some looked on the verge of a nervous breakdown,” she said. She was frustrated that the government had cited security concerns as its justification for putting applicants through a protracted checks. “My parents have been traveling to Britain to see their granddaughter for 16 years, they’ve had several multiple entry visas, they’re already in the Home Office system and they pose no threat to anyone. It is such a humiliating process.” She added: “These are people who have already fled 900 kilometres in a car, without food or water or a change of clothes. They’re running out of their medication, which we can’t get here without a prescription – and now they have to wait for clearance. It makes no sense.” Her father, Viacheslav Malyna, said: “The rules change so often and we still have no idea when we will actually get a visa. We feel very disappointed – not just from a moral point of view, but also because we’re not rich people. We can’t afford to stay on in a hotel because it is very costly.” The Home Office is to make it clear on Tuesday that those who have biometric appointments arranged later in the month no longer need to attend them, but will just need to upload their Ukrainian passports on to a website, and then wait for their applications to be processed – but applicants have not yet been informed that this is the revised procedure. Other applicants said that the processing time, even once the biometric tests have been done, is already taking longer than officials guidance suggests. Musician Robin Jax submitted an application on 4 March for his Ukrainian wife, Miroslava, and his mother-in-law Hanna Tkachenko, who uses a wheelchair. They met in Warsaw after she had fled Ukraine alongside about 2,000 people on a train designed for 560 passengers. Jax organised a visa appointment last Monday, where they gave fingerprints and were told that the application would probably be processed sometime after 24 hours and within five days. They are still waiting for confirmation that the visa has been granted. “Every UK Visas and Immigration member of staff I speak to is very compassionate, but they are caught by the fact that the policy is changing faster than they can answer our questions and we’re just stuck in limbo, waiting,” he said, adding that he was dismayed to be asked to give his bank details when he contacted a UKVI helpline, and charged 69p a minute for the call duration. “The system is set up against people who have had to leave their homes in the worst circumstances imaginable. I don’t think the UK response has been particularly humanitarian.” Lawyer Rosie Schumm has spent the weekend trying to make applications on behalf of her mother’s Ukrainian cousins, but she found that the website crashed when she tried to input information. She said: “The system is impenetrable and extremely complicated for me to use, even as a lawyer and with English as my first language. It took me four hours to complete and, after asking me to provide the most ridiculous number of documents, guided me to an outsourced page for making appointments in a biometric centre in Moldova – which has no available appointments whatsoever.” The Home Office was unable to give average times for visa processing. A government spokesperson said: “We have expanded our Visa Application Capacity to 13,000 a week, deployed additional staff across the EU, with a 24/7 helpline in place to ensure those who need appointments can get them to come here. This allows us to balance security risks while welcoming those in need.”",News/World news,‘A humiliating process’: Ukrainians caught in red tape trying to reach UK relatives,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/a-humiliating-process-ukrainians-caught-in-red-tape-trying-to-reach-uk-relatives
3/14/2022,"It has been just over two years since Donald Trump declared a national emergency in the face of the coronavirus pandemic that was rapidly spreading across the United States – and the rest of the world. Now, even as Covid-19 remains a threat, US public health officials and researchers are looking to the next potential pandemic – whether it’s influenza, another coronavirus, antimicrobial resistance, or a different health threat entirely – as they hope to build on the progress and avoid the pitfalls of the past two years. Knowledge of how respiratory viruses work – and how to battle them – has increased exponentially during this outbreak. But at the same time, misinformation about infectious diseases, especially vaccines and treatments, has multiplied, presenting new challenges. Scientists, several of whom have advised Joe Biden, recently released a 136-page “roadmap” for moving from Covid crisis to what they term the “next normal”. These investments include supporting health workers and strengthening health systems, as well as supporting survivors with long-term symptoms. A new disease forecasting center, the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, will become part of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), aiming to prepare for the next big outbreak. And a new bill with strong bipartisan support would create a 9/11-style commission to investigate the Covid response and learn from it. But the US was already thought to be prepared for the next pandemic – in fact, in November 2019, the US was ranked first among 195 countries for pandemic preparedness. Even so, the US response has been plagued by failures, including politicization, lack of trust, the individualization of health, and widespread inequality. And one key reason for the failure may have to do with something that would seem completely unrelated to public health. Trust – or a lack of it – played a major role in the pandemic’s scope, according to recent research that examined infection and fatality rates in 177 countries. The researchers sought potential connections to democracy, universal healthcare, hospital beds, quality of health services, and economic inequality. “We were not able to observe a connection between any of those things and how countries actually did,” said Thomas Bollyky, lead author of the study and the director of the global health program at the Council on Foreign Relations. Only one factor seemed to matter: trust in leaders and in one another. Building trust can play a critical role in preparing for the next pandemic, along with improving data collection and sharing, biomedical advances like vaccines and treatments, and low-tech solutions, like improving ventilation and wearing high-quality masks during respiratory outbreaks. Making such changes can strengthen a country’s pandemic response even in the midst of an outbreak. The Ebola outbreak that began in 2014 suffered, at first, from a poor response that prolonged the epidemic. People refused to allow health workers into their homes, or refused to go to clinics, because they were scared of what a diagnosis would mean. Local leaders promoted miracle cures, some of which were poisonous. As clinical trials for an Ebola vaccine ramped up, it was difficult to find volunteers because of skepticism or outright hostility toward first responders. But then, the response turned a corner – and Bollyky credits the U-turn to steady efforts to build confidence in officials, neighbors and other countries. National governments and other organizations held parades of Ebola survivors to boost confidence in getting tested, seeking treatment and recovering successfully. Local youth leaders, religious leaders and other community representatives encouraged participation in the vaccine clinical trials. Anthropologists worked with community representatives to develop burial practices that honored tradition while being less likely to spread the virus. And it was successful, helping end the largest, deadliest outbreak of Ebola. Applying these same lessons could bring Covid to heel – and it could help prevent or address the next big one, which could be even more dangerous. “In some ways, we were lucky with this pandemic, which is an odd thing to say. But the fact of the matter is, a future virus or novel influenza could certainly be more transmissible and more virulent,” Bollyky said. And all of the investments America makes in preparing for the next big one will help address Covid as well, experts said. “You’re using your present response to start to develop the behaviors, investments and infrastructure in order to be able to do the same response in a future crisis,” Bollyky said. Ventilation and air filtration are among those important infrastructure investments, said Rick Bright, chief executive of the Pandemic Prevention Institute at the Rockefeller Foundation and a former official for the US Department of Health and Human Services. “It’s really important for us to continue our investments in upgrading our air filtration systems in public buildings, restaurants, bars, transportation hubs, airplanes, airports, schools – reminding people of the importance of ventilation and filtration, and also being ready and able to be willing to wear the mask when we have high levels of virus prevalent in our community.” The development of vaccines and treatments, especially those built on quickly customizable platforms over the past two years, can play another critical role in responding to the next pandemic. Before Covid, the previous record for developing a vaccine was four years. It took 326 days to create and authorize a Covid mRNA vaccine, followed quickly by several more vaccines put into use around the globe. “That’s remarkably fast, and we also produced it at a greater scale than we’ve ever seen before,” Bollyky said. Most of the Covid vaccines are built on platforms that can be changed relatively quickly when new variants or viruses emerge – a very promising development that could change vaccinations for evolving and emerging pathogens. Technology under development could mean immunizations happen not with needles and syringes but simple skin patches, like Band-Aids, Bright said. New investments need to be made in the worldwide delivery of vaccines, both in terms of shipping and storing vaccines and educating people about the benefits of vaccination – and those investments will persist for the next outbreak, experts said. “Our only hope in future pandemics is to contain outbreaks closer to their source,” Bollyky said. “It is in our economic, moral and humanitarian interest to do something about the undervaccination that exists globally.” Improving faith in health officials and institutions could also prevent growing hesitations around vaccines, Bollyky said. With Covid, “we’ve unfortunately gone the wrong direction” and a new system of misinformation and disinformation could be mobilized in future pandemics as well – a worrying trend that needs to be addressed. While confidence has declined in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state governors, it has remained high in health workers, faith leaders and other community representatives, who can help guide current and future pandemic responses. Some of the mistrust is probably driven by vast inequities in American society, Bollyky said. “Addressing the sources of economic, social and political alienation in populations seems like the right place to start – in itself a good thing to do, and it does help start to address the long-term trust deficit. And what the pandemic has shown is, our lives depend on that.“ Vaccines and treatments are also most effective the earlier they can be used – which means data collection and sharing is key during a crisis. “To make them more effective, you have to use them sooner in the game … and the only way to do that was to have an earlier warning signal” of emerging viruses, Bright said. A persistent lack of these early warning systems “has always been this achilles heel in every pandemic we’ve seen in the past,” he said. “Going into this pandemic, we pretty much relied on a nose swab to get the information we needed to get, to know where the virus was spreading and how it was changing or evolving,” Bright said. That’s more expensive and slower than other signals, like wastewater monitoring. It also relies on individual behavior, which can be a difficult metric when some people are resistant to getting tested or don’t realize they are sick. Warning signs can instead be discovered through wastewater surveillance of pathogens like Covid, influenza and drug-resistant bacteria, for instance. The modern world is “a mosaic of signals”, Bright said. Changes in patterns – new illnesses cropping up in clinics, environmental changes to water and air, satellite images tracking new animal migration patterns – can then prompt epidemiologists to look for outbreaks more quickly and effectively. “What worries me is that we ignore the signal,” Bright said. It’s also important to share this information across borders – and not to penalize other countries with travel bans, as several nations did when South Africa and Botswana sounded the alarm on the Omicron variant. “In some cases, those restrictions actually hindered their ability to get the materials to keep surveilling the outbreak of the new variant,” Bollyky said. The next Covid variant is probably evolving or spreading now, Bright said. “​​I’m concerned, as we dial down more testing and more surveillance, that it’s going to turn the lights off on that battlefield and we’re not going to be able to see this variant as clearly and as quickly,” he said. “Many people think the pandemic is behind us and it’s over,” Bright said. But “anything and everything we do to prepare for the next surge will make us better for the next pathogen as well.” The biggest risk is forgetting or ignoring the hard-won lessons on Covid and other disease outbreaks, Bright said. “We always seem to get through them and then forget. We forget how bad it was, we forget how expensive it was, we forget how disruptive it was, and life goes back to normal. And then we don’t continue to invest in the innovation and technologies that got us through that crisis. And then the next pandemic comes along, and we’re not ready again and we’re starting from scratch.” But right now, he said, “we have an opportunity in the United States and around the world to continue funding, not let our foot off the gas, and drive these innovations.”",News/World news,America marks two years of Covid – is it prepared for the next pandemic?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/america-coronavirus-covid-pandemic-vaccines-public-health
