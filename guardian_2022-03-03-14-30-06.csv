3/3/2022,"All the winds of the west gather at the summit of Cothelstone Hill. To the east, cloud shadows chase gleams of light across the Somerset Levels to Glastonbury Tor. North lies the leaden silver of the Bristol Channel, punctuated by the islands of Flat Holm and Steep Holm. West is Exmoor, bulking dark against the sky. Looking south, it would be possible to see coast to coast to the Channel were it not for the long blade of the Blackdown Hills that lies between the seas like a sword. Cothelstone is not the highest point on the Quantocks. That distinction belongs to Will’s Neck, the heath-covered ridge nearby. But it is the most dramatic, and its stupendous views have attracted people for millennia. In the 18th century, a landowner, Lady Hillsborough, built an ornamental tower “for the purpose of prospect” and planted three rings of beech trees. The fierce storm of 1919 destroyed the tower, but the most famous of the tree-rings, the Seven Sisters, still stands as a landmark on the horizon, visible for miles. Lady Hillsborough was not the first – or last – to shape the hill. Her tower stood atop a bronze-age barrow, and she planted the Seven Sisters on the wide, flat platform of a disc barrow. Recent archaeological work has discovered a rare late bronze-age enclosure, suggestive of ceremonial uses. Hidden under brambles lies a second world war bunker, built for a secretive auxiliary unit trained in sabotage and assassination. The summit is exhilarating, but busy with dog walkers. Time to seek the mossy quiet of St Agnes Well further down the hill, a place of falling water and robin song. Here, a spring rises inside a squat wellhouse of pinky-grey stone, seeps out under a diminutive oak door and flows clear into a tiny basin. The well was said to be a place of divination where lovers could see their future. Locals avoided drinking from it because it was haunted by pixies – qualms not shared by the modern sheep in the neighbouring pasture. When I visited, the gate had been left open and the ground was pocked with hoofmarks showing where they had crowded in for refreshment.

3/3/2022,"Ben Roberts-Smith told other soldiers to lie about him kicking an unarmed, handcuffed Afghan man off a cliff, and “directed” them to say the man was a legitimate target discovered hiding in a cornfield, the federal court has heard. Person 4, a former SAS soldier, is giving evidence in Roberts-Smith’s defamation trial in Sydney. He has previously told the court he saw Roberts-Smith kick the handcuffed man – who was being held at the shoulder by another Australian soldier at the edge of a steep incline – in the chest, “catapulting him” off the cliff. “I saw the individual smash his face on a rock, and I saw the teeth explode out of his face,” he told the court. Person 4 said the Australian soldiers walked down a track to the bottom of the cliff and Roberts-Smith ordered him and another subordinate soldier to drag the man under a tree, where he was shot by the other soldier after discussion with Roberts-Smith. Person 4, who was medically discharged from the SAS last year, has been compelled by subpoena to give evidence by three Australian newspapers which Roberts-Smith is suing for defamation over reports he alleges portray him as committing war crimes, including murder, as well as acts of bullying and domestic violence. The newspapers – the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times – are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. On Thursday, Person 4’s fourth day in the witness box, he told the trial there was a patrol debrief back at the Australians’ base in Tarin Kot, in southern Afghanistan, immediately following the raid on the village of Darwan, in September 2012. Person 4 said Roberts-Smith, who was patrol commander, told the troops: “This is what the story is, that we engaged the individual on the way to the HLS [helicopter landing site].” Arthur Moses SC, acting for Roberts-Smith, queried Person 4 under cross-examination: “You were being told to tell a false story?” “We were directed to tell a false story,” Person 4 replied. “You seem to forget he was a VC winner at this time,” Person 4 continued, “he was running his own narrative.” “The only person running their own narrative is you,” Moses said, suggesting Person 4 had invented the conversation. “Absolutely not.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Person 4 said shortly after the Darwan operation, he was part of a group of SAS soldiers talking when Roberts-Smith bragged about kicking the man off the cliff. Person 4 told the court: “He [Roberts-Smith] said words to the effect of: ‘I kicked the cunt off the cliff’.” Person 4 said he was shocked at Roberts-Smith’s admission. “He had just gone against what he had directed us to do.” During an at-times heated cross-examination on Thursday, Moses repeatedly asserted Person 4 was motivated by malice or that he had fictionalised his account. “That is incorrect,” Person 4 replied. After repeated questions about Person 4’s reliability – “are you sure your medication isn’t impacting on your memory?” – Moses was warned by Justice Anthony Besanko that he had the power to disallow questions which were belittling or disrespectful to witnesses.

But he said he was never involved, and felt caught in the middle of the pro- and anti-Roberts-Smith camps inside the regiment. Person 4 said he believed Roberts-Smith was a valorous soldier: “I have seen him perform heroic feats on the battlefield.” The court has heard Person 4 and Roberts-Smith were comrades for years, and deployed together to Afghanistan several times. They fought shoulder-to-shoulder at the 13-hour battle of Tizak in 2010, together silencing two Taliban machine gunners who were raking their patrol with fire, an action that earned Roberts-Smith the Victoria Cross, and Person 4 the Medal for Gallantry. The allegation at Darwan is one of the central allegations made against Roberts-Smith by the newspapers. In his evidence before the court last year, Roberts-Smith said the alleged version of events could not have happened because “there was no cliff … there was no kick”, and that the slain man was an enemy “spotter” who was discovered hiding in a cornfield and lawfully killed within the military’s rules of engagement. Over four days in the witness box, Person 4 has repeatedly refused to answer questions about a 2009 SAS mission – raiding a compound called Whiskey 108 in the village of Kakarak – on grounds of potential self-incrimination. The court has heard evidence from another Australian soldier during this trial that Roberts-Smith ordered Person 4 to shoot an unarmed, elderly captive Afghan man discovered hiding in a tunnel during a raid on a compound in Uruzgan province in 2009. Roberts-Smith has previously described the allegation as “completely false”. Moses extensively questioned Person 4 about an alleged deal between his legal representatives and the newspapers not to ask questions about Whiskey 108 in exchange for his testimony about Darwan. Lawyers for the newspapers have previously argued there was no agreement, nor any improper arrangement, merely that they had made a forensic decision not to press certain questions if the witness objected. Person 4 reiterated he was a reluctant witness, and was only giving evidence under force of subpoena. He told the court the trial – when it started last year – had been the most significant factor in causing him to be admitted to a mental health facility. He said he had been at risk of harming himself. He said he had been told by his lawyer that there was an agreement in place with lawyers for the newspapers that their “questioning would only be focused on the Darwan matter” and not on the Whiskey 108 matter, for his “self-protection”. “It was just trying to relieve the pressure of the courtroom for me.” Moses asked Person 4 directly: “I want to put it to you that Mr Roberts-Smith did not order you to kill an unarmed PUC [person under control] at Whiskey 108.” “I object, your honour, on grounds of self-incrimination,” Person 4 said. Person 4 remains in the witness box. The trial, before Justice Besanko, continues.",News/Australia news,"Ben Roberts-Smith told soldiers to lie about him kicking Afghan off cliff, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/03/ben-roberts-smith-told-soldiers-to-lie-about-him-kicking-afghan-off-cliff-court-hears
3/3/2022,"The Morrison government has junked $65m of spending on four commuter car parks it promised to build in the electorate of the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg. Kooyong in Victoria was to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the $660m commuter car park projects which the Australian National Audit Office found were hand-picked by the government on the advice of its MPs and candidates in a process that “was not demonstrably merit-based”. The decision to junk proposed car parks at Canterbury, Glenferrie, Camberwell and Surrey Hills will fuel criticisms the projects were unviable due to lack of consultation and planning, and were designed to shore up the Coalition vote in at-risk seats. In a statement on Thursday, Frydenberg said the government promised the stations after “consultation with the Boroondara Council who made it very clear there was a significant lack of parking at railway stations in the area”. He said the government had “decided not to proceed with funding for the proposed car parks at Canterbury, Glenferrie and Camberwell” following a consultation process with “significant local feedback”. The station at Surrey Hills “cannot go ahead as proposed” because the Victorian government merged Surrey Hills and Mont Albert stations in 2019, he said. Announced in May 2019 weeks out from the election, the four Kooyong carparks were to house up to 500 cars each. But when detailed planning work was conducted after the election, Boroondara Council found significant local concern about traffic near stations and design constraints. It estimated that with $20m of federal funding it could deliver just 90 extra spaces at Camberwell, leading to criticisms the projects were poor value for money. Of the 48 car park projects promised through the urban congestion fund program, six were cancelled in the 2021 budget. In February, just six commuter car parks had been completed and a further six were under construction. Labor’s shadow infrastructure minister, Catherine King, said the cancellation of four further projects was a “humiliating backflip” for the treasurer and questioned how much money had been “wasted” on car parks that wouldn’t be built. “This is a major public policy failure from the man supposedly in charge of our nation’s finances,” she said. “These projects were hand-selected by the prime minister and his senior ministers to try to hold on to seats they were worried about, and now with another election on the horizon, the entire program is falling apart. “Ahead of the last election Josh Frydenberg made a lot of big promises, but has spent the last term failing to deliver.” Frydenberg said the $4.8bn urban congestion fund “remains an important part of the government’s plans to get more cars off our roads and to make public transport more accessible”. By the end of 2022, 70% of the promised car park projects will be under construction or finished, he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Canterbury Car Park Residents Group welcomed the decision to junk the proposed car park, arguing it was a case of “the wrong car park in the wrong place”. The ANAO found projects were identified in part through ministers’ offices canvassing the views of 23 Coalition MPs, senators and the Coalition candidates for six electorates then held by Labor or Centre Alliance. This process started with a list identifying 20 marginal electorates and inviting those MPs to select projects. The government has consistently defended its handling of the program, including in August when Scott Morrison said Australians were the “winners” because they “are getting … more car parks”. In October, ANAO officials told Senate estimates that Alan Tudge instructed staff to first consult marginal seat MPs before commuter car parks were selected, despite the former urban infrastructure minister’s claims that projects were chosen on merit.",News/Australia news,Coalition scraps $65m spend on four car parks in Josh Frydenberg’s electorate,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/03/coalition-scraps-65m-spend-on-four-car-parks-in-josh-frydenbergs-electorate
3/3/2022,"The Black Sea port of Kherson has become the first major Ukrainian target to fall under the de facto control of Russia forces, as the United Nations said more than a million people had fled the country since the invasion began a week ago. As the international criminal court said it had begun collecting evidence of possible war crimes in Ukraine, Kherson’s mayor, Igor Kolykhaiev, said in a Facebook post early on Thursday that Russian troops were in control of the city hall and that residents should obey a curfew imposed by what he called the “armed visitors”. Amid conflicting reports about the fate of the strategically important city, Kolykhaiev said he had made “no promises” to the Russian forces and that he was “only interested in the normal life of our city! I just asked [them] not to shoot people”. Other restrictions imposed on the city include a curfew from 8pm until 6am with only cars transporting food, medicines and other necessities permitted to enter the city. The Russian attack on the city left bodies strewn about the city streets, power outages, limited water and little food, the New York Times reported Kolykhaiev as saying in a separate interview. A group of about 10 armed Russian officers entered the city hall and informed him that they planned to set up a military administration, the mayor added. Gennady Lakhuta, head of the regional administration, wrote on the messaging service Telegram late on Wednesday that the city had been overrun by Russian troops. “The [Russian] occupiers are in all parts of the city and are very dangerous,” he said, according to Agence France-Presse. Russian artillery and missiles have continued to bombard other major cities including the capital, Kyiv, and the second-biggest city, Kharkiv, where a Ukrainian member of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe’s (OSCE) monitoring mission was killed in a bombing. There is also still believed to be fierce fighting in the port of Mariupol in the country’s south-east where Ukrainian forces are surrounded by the Russian-aligned forces. “We cannot even take the wounded from the streets, from apartments, since the shelling does not stop,” its mayor said, adding that Russian attacks had been repelled “with dignity”. Hundreds of civilians have been killed, according to UN estimates, although the real tally is feared to be much higher. Ukraine’s government said on Wednesday nearly 6,000 Russian troops had been killed. Moscow said the figure was 498. As the conflict entered its second week the UN high commissioner for refugees, Filippo Grandi, said there had been an “exodus” from Ukraine to neighbouring countries of more than one million people, or around 2% of the population of 44 million. Grandi appealed for the “guns to fall silent” so humanitarian aid could reach millions more still inside the country, and cautioned that the flood of people escaping the war was far from over and could eventually total 4 million. In another dramatic development, the UK and 37 other countries formally referred reports of atrocities committed in Ukraine to the international criminal court (ICC) on Wednesday, the largest such referral in the court’s history. Under ICC rules, such a referral from member states means the court’s prosecutor, Karim Khan, has already been able to start collecting evidence for the investigation without waiting for the approval of ICC judges. Britain’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, in statement: “Putin’s military machine is targeting civilians indiscriminately and tearing through towns across Ukraine. An investigation by the international criminal court into Russia’s barbaric acts is urgently needed and it is right that those responsible are held to account. The UK will work closely with allies to ensure justice is done.” In New York, an emergency session of the UN general assembly voted overwhelmingly to deplore Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and called for the immediate withdrawal of its forces. Of the 193 member states, 141 voted for the resolution, 35 abstained, and five – Russia, Belarus, Syria, North Korea and Eritrea – voted against. The resolution deplored Russian aggression against Ukraine “in the strongest terms” and demanded that “the Russian Federation immediately cease its use of force against Ukraine” and “immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces”. The resolution is not legally binding, but is an expression of the views of the UN membership, aimed at increasing pressure on Moscow and its ally, Belarus. The OSCE named the killed member of its monitoring team as Maryna Fenina, who died in Kharkiv while collecting supplies for her family. The city has come under intense shelling by Russian forces in recent days, with police and university buildings bombarded and government offices reduced to rubble. “In Kharkiv and other cities and towns in Ukraine, missiles, shells and rockets are hitting residential buildings and town centers, killing and injuring innocent civilians – women, men and children alike,” the OSCE said. “We strongly condemn the increased shelling in urban areas,” it added, reiterating its call “on the Russian Federation for an immediate cessation of hostilities”. The international effort to isolate Russia and cripple its economy also continued when the World Bank said on Wednesday it had stopped all programs in Russia and Belarus with immediate effect. Russian oligarch’s were also being squeezed as German authorities reportedly seized the $600m superyacht belonging to Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov in a Hamburg shipyard. It came after Roman Abramovich put English football club Chelsea up for sale, nearly 20 years after he took control. A second round of talks between Ukraine and Russia is due to get under way on Thursday, Russian negotiators reportedly said, adding that a ceasefire was “on the agenda”. However, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said Moscow’s demands are unacceptable and Russia must stop bombing cities if any progress is to be made. The war again wreaked havoc on financial markets as the price of Brent crude oil soared to more than $117 a barrel on Thursday, marking a 20% rise this week. A range of other commodities such as aluminium, iron ore and wheat rose again, intensifying concerns that the global economy is going to be thrown off course by runaway inflation.",News/World news,"Ukraine war: refugee ‘exodus’ has reached a million, says UN, as Russia takes over Kherson ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/ukraine-war-refugee-exodus-has-reached-a-million-says-un-as-russia-takes-over-kherson
3/3/2022,"The UN nuclear watchdog has voiced concern after Russian forces claimed to have surrounded Ukraine’s biggest atomic plant, and called for its workers to be left alone to do their jobs. Rafael Grossi, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said the Russian government had informed the agency that its troops had taken control of the area around the Zaporizhzhia plant in south-eastern Ukraine, the second biggest in Europe, housing six of the country’s 15 reactors. In their letter to the IAEA, Russian officials insisted that Ukrainian staff at the plant were continuing to “work on providing nuclear safety and monitoring radiation in normal mode of operation”. However, the Ukrainian state enterprise running the country’s nuclear industry, Energoatom, accused the Russian military of “openly terrorizing employees of the station and residents of its satellite city Energodar”. Ukraine has asked the IAEA to declare a 30km safe zone around Ukraine’s four nuclear power plants. Grossi told the IAEA board of governors meeting in Vienna: “It is of critical importance that the armed conflict and activities on the ground around Zaporizhihia nuclear power plant and any other of Ukraine’s nuclear facilities in no way interrupts or endangers the facilities or the people working at and around them.” The IAEA also said that a feed of radiation data from Zaporizhzhia had been interrupted on Tuesday and that Ukraine’s nuclear regulatory inspectorate (SNRIU) was trying to find out the reason for the break and to restore the flow of data. Grossi also raised concern over a report from the SNRIU that since Russians took over the Chernobyl plant, site of the 1986 disaster in north western Ukraine near the Belarus border, the staff there had not been permitted to go home. The US deputy envoy to the IAEA, Louis Bono, said: “The Ukrainian staff at the site have not been allowed to leave and have been forced to work multiple shifts. This added stress on staff performing critical tasks further jeopardizes the safety and security of the site and the public.” In his remarks Grossi said: “It is of utmost importance that the staff working at [the Chernobyl plant] are able to do their job safely and effectively, and that their personal wellbeing is guaranteed by those who have taken control,” The remains of the reactor core which exploded in 1986 is buried under concrete at the site, and there are also spent fuel storage facilities and a large amount of radioactive dust in the topsoil of the surrounding area. The churning up of the soil by Russian military vehicles caused limited radiation spikes. In a statement, Energoatom said: “Being in the exclusion zone now and apparently not having the skills to ensure personal safety when working in radioactively contaminated areas, the invaders are exposed to significant external and internal radiation, which will undoubtedly manifest itself in the form of cancer.” On Sunday, the Ukrainian authorities said Russian missiles had struck the site of a radioactive waste disposal facility in Kyiv. The day before, an electrical transformer in another waste facility in Kharkiv was damaged. In both cases there was no radioactive release, but the incidents highlighted the potential threat of ecological disaster from a war underway in a country with an extensive nuclear industry. The American Nuclear Society (ANS), an association of industry professionals, is seeking to send material support to Ukraine to help nuclear workers there. “The staff at Ukraine’s nuclear power plants must be able to fulfill their duties without interruption undue pressure or the fear of being killed or injured,” the ANS said in a statement. “Ukraine’s nuclear workers need their rest between shifts, access to their homes and a peace of mind that their loved ones are safe. The society’s president, Steven Nesbit, said he hoped that the Russian invaders were aware of the dangers of a nuclear accident. “All I can say is it’s hard to believe that they wouldn’t have a sensitivity to the issues here,” Nesbit said. “Russia and Vladimir Putin need to be taking all steps they can to avoid becoming even more of a pariah nation than they have become.” ",News/World news,"Russian forces surround Ukraine’s biggest nuclear plant, sparking UN concerns ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/russian-forces-surround-ukraines-biggest-nuclear-plant-sparking-un-concerns
3/3/2022,"Tears, hugs, laughter and the shouts of children echoed through the arrivals halls of New Zealand, as the country opened its borders and lifted isolation requirements. “I’ve been waiting six months for this moment,” says Steve, 72, who was waiting for his fiancee, Karin, to arrive from Australia. “I’m over the moon,” he said. “I feel a bit shaky.” Steve said he had cleaned their motor-home, complete with karaoke machine, from top to bottom, in preparation for taking a trip around New Zealand for the pair to see their friends and family. “We’ve been talking on the phone for five hours a day to keep our sanity that way,” says Steve. “It’s been very hard.” For almost two years, New Zealand’s international airports’ arrival terminals have been shuttered ghost towns. Apart from a short-lived travel bubble with Australia, the country’s borders have been closed, with those lucky enough to secure entry into the country whisked to government-managed isolation and quarantine facilities for a costly two weeks secluded in a hotel room. Wednesday marked the end of that era for returning citizens, and for the first time since March 2020, flights on Thursday touched down full of New Zealanders without isolation or quarantine requirements. For others, the joy of a reunion was tempered by grief. “I’m waiting for my brother and his new bride,” said Tania Fitzhenry, breaking into tears. “We’re trying to get back down to Huntly in time for him to see our dad.” The family has been waiting a long time for border restrictions to lift, so that her brother could return and say farewell to their very unwell father. “It feels like forever,” she says. “I think Dad’s been waiting all week. I hope to God, please hold on, he’s just got to hold on a couple more hours. Up until last night we were saying, dad, it’s OK to let go – but then [it became] Craig’s close enough now, you’ve got to hold on.” New Zealand’s initial staged border reopening plan, first announced in November, was derailed by the arrival of Omicron. The government resurrected its reopening plans in February, with the proviso that travellers still had to self-isolate for 10 days. This week, as the country’s Covid transmission rates soared to some of the highest in the world and cases in the community far outnumbered those at the border, that requirement was dropped and the entry dates for New Zealanders around the world were pulled forward. For some New Zealanders, it marks the end of a bitter, difficult journey. Many have found themselves separated from family, unable to farewell dying loved ones, missing family milestones, in breach of visa requirements or forced into illegal overstaying overseas. “People in this group have waited so long for this,” Justine Kirby of Grounded Kiwis, a group advocating on behalf of New Zealanders stranded overseas, said in a statement. “[There are] many for whom this has come too late. And it’s also deeply personal for me: I haven’t seen any family members for almost four years now,” she said. After the announcement, “I called Mum and, for the first time since early 2020, we started to make some travel plans together. Lots of happy tears.” The border opened to New Zealanders and eligible travellers arriving from Australia on Monday and, on Friday, it opens to all other New Zealanders. Cabinet will consider reopening dates for tourists and other visitors in the coming months. From Thursday, vaccinated travellers will no longer need to self-isolate but will still be required to undergo a Covid-19 test on arrival and on day five or six, prime minister Jacinda Ardern announced on Monday. If the traveller tests positive for the virus, they will be required to self-isolate, in line with requirements for New Zealanders. Unvaccinated travellers will still have to stay in managed isolation.",News/World news,‘Lots of happy tears’: joy as New Zealand opens border after two years of isolation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/03/lots-of-happy-tears-joy-as-new-zealand-opens-border-after-two-years-of-isolation
3/3/2022,"While Queensland and New South Wales have been hit with historic rainfall and floods, Tasmania has endured its driest summer in 40 years. The island state’s west and south-west – both sparsely populated and typically wet – recorded their lowest levels of rainfall on record, the Bureau of Meteorology said. This meant that across the state it was driest summer since 1980-81, and the fourth driest since records began more than a century ago. Total rainfall was 43% below the long-term average. Parts of the south-west had between 200mm and 400mm less rain than they normally would in summer. This was consistent with projections of changed rainfall across the state due to rising temperatures caused by greenhouse gas emissions. A major report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published this week found that global heating was expected to lead to more winter rain in Tasmania but a reduction in summer rain in the state’s west. Anna Forrest, a meteorologist with the bureau, said the impact of the La Niña weather pattern that has helped drive the extraordinary rain further north was likely to have played a role in reducing the amount of rain in Tasmania. During a La Niña event, strong trade winds blow west across the Pacific Ocean, pushing warm surface water towards Asia and the seas north of Australia. The warmer waters lead to increased rainfall across northern and eastern Australia but play a different role further south. “The predominant wind direction for Tasmania is westerly but this summer we’ve had a lot of easterly winds,” Forrest said. “It is highly unusual but that is the impact a La Niña has on Tasmania’s climate. It basically swings the wind around.” The Tasmanian dry spell coincided with one of the state’s hottest summers on record. The mean temperature across days and nights was 1.3C higher than average, making it the fifth warmest summer since records began. The average maximum day time temperature was 1.7C above the long-term average. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Across the country, it was the 17th warmest summer on record. It was 0.73C above the long-term average measured across the years 1961 to 1990, but cooler than some recent summers, reflecting La Niña’s impact. Summer rainfall was close to average for Australia as a whole. The IPCC last year reported that human activities were unequivocally heating the planet, affecting weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe and helping to cause increased heatwaves, heavier rainfall events and more intense droughts and tropical cyclones. In Australia it found that average temperatures above land had already increased by about 1.4C since 1910. Annual changes in temperature were now above what could be expected from natural variation in all regions across the continent. A scientific review has concluded that the frequency of El Niño, which is associated with higher temperatures in eastern Australia, and La Niña events were expected to increase under business-as-usual scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions.",News/Australia news,Tasmania records driest summer in 40 years as La Niña ‘swings the wind around’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/03/tasmania-records-driest-summer-in-40-years-as-la-nina-swings-the-wind-around
