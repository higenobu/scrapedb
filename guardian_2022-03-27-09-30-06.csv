3/27/2022,"Amnesty International has criticised plans by the justice secretary Dominic Raab to replace Labour’s Human Rights Act with a British bill of rights.Raab has argued that the proposal will better protect the press in exposing wrongdoing and said he feared free speech was being “whittled away” by “wokery and political correctness”.The deputy prime minister told the Daily Mail that under plans being drawn up, there would be only limited restrictions placed on the protections on free speech with checks to stop people abusing it to promote terrorism.Laura Trevelyan, Amnesty’s human rights in the UK campaign manager, hit out at his plan on Saturday. “Scrapping the Human Rights Act has long been the intention of Mr Raab and others not because they want to extend any protections, but because they want to slash away at the powers ordinary people have got to challenge the government and its decisions,” she said. “I hope people don’t fall for this latest attempt to mislead; just this week the Human Rights Act protected free speech when a journalist used it to defend the confidentiality of his sources.“When you think about the Human Rights Act, think of Hillsborough, or the successful challenge to police banning women from holding a vigil for Sarah Everard, or how the government will be forced to hold a proper inquiry into its handling of the Covid pandemic.“The Human Rights Act is the most important weapon ordinary people have against the state and wrongful treatment, and we should all be very suspicious of the very people it holds to account telling us they are doing us a favour by watering it down.”The proposals, currently out for consultation, are expected to be included in the Queen’s speech later this year. Raab told Saturday’s Daily Mail: “We will still be clamping down on those who try and use either media or free speech to incite violence, to radicalise terrorists, or to threaten children. All of those safeguards will be in place. “But we’ve got to be able to strengthen free speech, the liberty that guards all of our other freedoms, and stop it being whittled away surreptitiously, sometimes without us really being conscious of it. “So it will have a different status in the pecking order of rights and I think that will go a long way to protecting this country’s freedom of speech and our history, which has always very strongly protected freedom of speech.” In December, the government announced a consultation to revise the Human Rights Act.The Human Rights Act was introduced by Tony Blair’s government in 1998 to enable UK nationals to rely on rights contained in the European convention on human rights before the domestic courts.",News/Law,Amnesty hits out at Tory plans to replace Human Rights Act with bill of rights,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/mar/27/amnesty-hits-out-at-tory-plans-to-replace-human-rights-act-with-bill-of-rights
3/27/2022,"Joe Biden has condemned Vladimir Putin as a “butcher” who could no longer stay in power in a historic speech in Poland. The US president appeared to urge those around the Russian president to oust him from the Kremlin, although US officials later said he had been talking about the need for Putin to lose power over Ukrainian territory and in the wider region. As Biden spoke, Russian missiles rained down on Ukraine’s most pro-western city, Lviv, 40 miles from the Polish border. The timing of the attacks, only the third on west Ukrainian targets since the war began, and the closest to Lviv’s city centre and its residential areas, was clearly designed to send a message to the White House. The Kremlin has again raised the spectre of the use of nuclear weapons in the war with Ukraine. Dmitry Medvedev, the previous president of Russia and deputy chairman of its security council, said Moscow could use them to strike an enemy that only used conventional weapons. The comments prompted Volodymyr Zelenskiy, appearing by video link at Qatar’s Doha Forum, to warn that Moscow was a direct threat to the world. “Russia is deliberating bragging they can destroy with nuclear weapons, not only a certain country but the entire planet,” said the Ukrainian president. Ukrainian troops are reporting that Russian forces are using white phosphorus against them near the eastern city of Avdiivka. While these reports could not be confirmed, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has told Nato leaders that Russia had used phosphorus bombs that had killed adults and children. Russian forces temporarily seized Slavutych, a northern town close to the Chernobyl nuclear site on Saturday, and took prisoner its mayor, Yuri Fomichev. After failing to disperse the numerous protesters in the main square – despite using stun grenades and firing in the air – the Russian troops released the mayor and agreed to leave. The Institute of Mass Media in Ukraine has documented 148 crimes against journalists and the media since the start of the Russian invasion. It said five journalists had been killed, six captured or kidnapped and seven wounded. The Ukrainian parliament has confirmed a fresh Russian attack on the nuclear research reactor in Kharkiv. In a tweet, it quoted the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate as saying: “It is currently impossible to estimate the extent of damage due to hostilities that do not stop in the area of the nuclear installation.” Tens of thousands of people have gathered in central London to express solidarity with the people of Ukraine. After a call by Volodymyr Zelenskiy for protests around the world against the Russian invasion, Trafalgar Square was transformed into a sea of yellow and blue. Experts in the UK have warned that its Homes for Ukraine scheme risks operating as “Tinder for sex traffickers”. The warning comes as evidence emerges that UK-based criminals are targeting women and children fleeing the war.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 32 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/27/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-32-of-the-invasion
3/27/2022,"Compared to some of his pet projects – the bridge across the Irish Sea or a floating airport in the Thames – Boris Johnson’s plan to get 25% of UK electricity from nuclear power plants by 2050 isn’t all that fanciful. The same mark was reached within living memory, after the commissioning of Sizewell B in 1995. If the climate crisis weren’t reason enough, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has crystallised the case for any energy technology that allows us to eschew fossil fuels supplied by foreign despots. This week, the prime minister is expected to outline his plan to make the UK more energy self-sufficient, with nuclear likely to be a key component. Charging at full pelt towards a nuclear future is far from straightforward, though, if history is anything to go by. Even when the UK did produce a quarter of its electricity from nukes, the journey there was long and bumpy. Sizewell B was hooked up to the national grid in 1995, but it was first announced in 1969, with spades only breaking ground in 1986. More recently, the industry has been in steady decline. Since that mid-90s peak, capacity has fallen from nearly 13GW to 6.8GW, about 16-18% of the electricity mix. Hunterston B retired this year, Hinkley Point B bows out this summer and by the time Hartlepool I and Heysham I come off grid in 2024, nuclear capacity will have fallen to a paltry 3.6GW, a mere 5-6% of what you’d need at 6pm on a cold weekday in winter. Hinkley Point C is due to recoup 3.2GW of lost ground but only by 2027, assuming no fresh delays. It is not nearly enough to get close to Johnson’s target. That will require the successful execution of nearly every nuclear project to have been mooted in recent years, including some that have struggled to get going so far. It would probably mean extending the life of Sizewell B and giving the go-ahead for Sizewell C, which stalled when the government got cold feet about Chinese involvement. Wylfa on Anglesey, paused after Japanese firm Hitachi pulled out in 2020 citing lack of government investment, would need to be thrown into the mix. Factor in, too, Rolls-Royce’s “mini-nuke” small reactors, which have state backing but carry the risk of novelty. Some of the GE Hitachi partnership’s own small reactors might need to be included too. All of that gets you to about 15GW, likely to fall below 25% of demand in 2050, once you consider that the drive towards net zero will involve significant electrification, of home heating and vehicles, in order to decarbonise. Some in the nuclear industry are daring to breathe the names of semi-mythical locations such as Oldbury and Moorside, where large-scale nuclear projects were abandoned but could be raised from their slumber. The government, previously cordial but cool towards nuclear, appears to be warming to such ideas, minds focused by sky-high fossil fuel prices. As Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, says: “It has reminded people why a significant reliance on something traded internationally [oil and gas] isn’t a good place to be.” There are fences to jump. Financing problems have put paid to major projects in the past. The Treasury still hasn’t rubber-stamped proposals for a regulated asset base (RAB) funding model, which could spur private investment by transferring some of the risk of multibillion-pound projects to the taxpayer. The UK must also resolve the “taxonomy” issue, already sorted in the EU, which determines whether nuclear is suitable for investment funds using environmental and social criteria. There is also a question mark over the number of skilled engineers available, particularly if the nuclear push is replicated across Europe. But George Borovas, head of the nuclear practice at global law firm Hunton Andrew’s Kurth, believes the UK is among the best-placed countries in the world to go nuclear. “The UK has done the preliminary work, it’s done the site evaluation, it has a sophisticated regulator, good heavy industry and an existing fleet. I’ve always thought the UK was a great place for new nuclear.”",News/Business,"Nuclear power is back in the game, but remains a distant prospect for UK",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/27/nuclear-power-is-back-in-the-game-but-remains-a-distant-prospect-for-uk

3/27/2022,"For SS22, designers played with different colours, textures and stripe sizes to create an impact, from bold, bright stripes at Brandon Maxwell, Emporio Armani and Christian Siriano, to a fringed woven striped dress at Chloé. And you can’t talk stripes and not mention Paul Smith (above): multicoloured stripes have been at the heart of the brand from the start. This season they were mixed with sunflower prints and contrasted with a palette of sun-bleached lemon and rich terracotta. Successful stripe-wearing is all in the styling. Take one striped piece as a focal point. The shirt is a great starting point: Kitri’s frilled shirt (1 below), or La Redoute’s long-sleeved version (8 below), are both perfect to style with denim from wide-leg jeans to a mini skirt, finished with chunky loafers. A diagonal wraparound stripe can be easier to wear. Stine Goya’s Scharla jumper (7 below) in pastel hues looks great with crisp white wide-leg trousers. We Are Thought’s pink and white Breton (£39.95) is a fresh take on the nautical trend, as is Boden’s contrast sleeve in pink and red (£35). Or go all-in like Lashana Lynch (left) in a fully striped ensemble for maximum wow factor. Asos’s yellow and white striped seersucker mini dress with puff sleeves and a high neck (£85) is the perfect sundress and can be dressed up for an event with gold accessories. Meanwhile the quickest way to cheer up an outfit is a colourful striped bag. Oxfam’s roomy shopper (£4.99), and Oklahoma’s market bags make the supermarket run joyful and will double as beach or picnic bags. 1. Shirt £125, kitristudio.com 2.

3/27/2022,"The first half of Andy Murray’s season came to a tepid end on Saturday as he was placed under sustained pressure by one of the best players in the world and could not withstand it long enough. Daniil Medvedev, the first seed, was far too solid for Murray as he eased to a 6-4, 6-2 win in their second round match at the Miami Open. Despite the one-sided scoreline, Murray did not perform particularly badly. He served reasonably well in the opening set, winning 83% of his first-serve points, he was competitive in the majority of the predictably long exchanges and struck his forehand well. But any positive work was undermined by an error-strewn service game at 1-1 in the opening set. As Murray attempted to keep up, Medvedev only improved as the match progressed. He gave so little away while maintaining immaculate depth with his groundstrokes and gradually began to pick Murray’s poor second serve apart, winning 73% of points behind it in the second set. Murray left without generating a break point, a difficult statistic to stomach for such a renowned returner. This defeat will offer Murray a moment to pause and reflect after an uneventful start to the season when he has been unable to build on the promise shown by reaching the final in Sydney in January. The majority of his tournaments have panned out in similar fashion, often winning his first-round matches, meeting a seeded player in the second round and then losing in two close enough sets. As an unseeded player relying on wildcards to enter tournaments, most of his draws have not been easy and few have fallen his way. Murray has opted out of contesting the clay court season, meaning he will now begin a training block with eyes already on the grass season and Wimbledon. He will have much to consider as he begins work with his coach, Ivan Lendl, again and looks to see if he can make more progress in the second half of the year. “I think [he will bring] some clarity over the right way to play and the right way to practise,” said Murray. “I don’t feel I have been practising the right things for 18 months or so and it is difficult to undo that in the space of a few weeks. Hence [that is] one of the reasons I am taking a big period of training to try to change some of those things and get my game into a place where it’s more competitive against the top players again.” Heather Watson’s positive run ended with a 6-4, 6-1 loss to Belinda Bencic, the 22nd seed, in the third round. Watson upset the No 15 seed, Elina Svitolina, in the second round, her best win for two years.",Sport/Sport,Andy Murray switches focus to grass after another early exit in Miami,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/26/andy-murray-switches-focus-to-grass-after-another-early-exit-in-miami
