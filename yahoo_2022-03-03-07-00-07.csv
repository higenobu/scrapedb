3/3/2022,"Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC/Getty Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis A school superintendent is responding after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was filmed berating students for wearing face masks during a visit to the University of South Florida on Wednesday. Before a speech, DeSantis was filmed telling a group of high school students standing behind him, ""You do not have to wear those masks. I mean, please take them off. Honestly, it's not doing anything and we've gotta stop with this COVID theater. So if you want to wear it, fine, but this is ridiculous."" While some of the students could be seen removing their masks in response to the comments, others kept them on.

RELATED: Ron DeSantis Claims 'Fabricated Media Narrative' of Tension with Trump, Says He's Focused on Re-Election According to the district seven children were in attendance at the press conference, which was held to announce funding for cybersecurity education. All of the students attend Tampa's Middleton High School. ""We are excited our students from Middleton High School were highlighted as part of the statewide focus around cyber security education,"" Davis said in the statement. ""Our Cyber Security pathway at MHS has had tremendous success through student's earning industry certifications, participating in internships and leading the way in computer systems and information technology."" The statement continued: ""As always, our students should be valued and celebrated. It is a student and parents' choice to protect their health in a way they feel most appropriate. We are proud of the manner in which our students represented themselves and our school district."" While DeSantis is widely rumored to be preparing a 2024 presidential run, he is shot down that speculation, saying in previous interviews that he is ""not considering anything beyond doing my job."" The Republican governor, who narrowly won his 2018 election, is not without controversy. Still, he's worked to raise his national profile over the past few years, sometimes by fueling culture-war conflicts similar to former President Donald Trump. DeSantis has touted his decision not to impose widespread restrictions during the pandemic (though it's worth noting he did order a statewide lockdown in April 2020) but he has faced much scrutiny for his handling of the virus. He opposed mandating public health measures in the state and attempted to block local leaders' authority to issue mask mandates in municipalities throughout the state. RELATED: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis Downplays 2024 Aspirations: 'Not Considering Anything' Last July, DeSantis issued an order barring local school districts from requiring students to wear masks, despite federal recommendations that all students in kindergarten through 12th grade wear face coverings when they return to the classroom in the fall. A fundraising group affiliated with DeSantis also released a line of merchandise that takes aim at masks and White House medical adviser Anthony Fauci, such as a $12 ""Don't Fauci My Florida"" koozie.",U.S./People,School Superintendent Responds After Florida Gov.

3/3/2022,"Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, said on Ukrainian television on Tuesday that his country received information about a planned assassination attempt on President Volodymyr Zelensky from agents of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB). “I can say that we received information from representatives of the FSB, who today have no desire to take part in this bloody war,” said Danilov, who claimed that the Chechen special forces sent to kill Zelensky had been “eliminated.” “The Kadyrovites’ elite group, which came here specifically to eliminate our president, was directly destroyed,” he said. Kadyrovites refers to a Chechen paramilitary group accused of a number of human-rights violations and abuses. They serve at the pleasure of Razman Kadyrov, the head of the Chechen Republic and a close ally of Vladimir Putin. Western leaders have urged Zelensky to flee the country, but he has remained in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. Responding to an offer of evacuation by the United States, Zelensky reportedly replied that “the fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride.” “No one is going to break us. We are strong. We are Ukrainians,” the Ukrainian president said in an address before the European Parliament on Tuesday. “We have a desire to see our children alive.

3/3/2022,"France's finance minister said Tuesday that Western sanctions would cause the Russian economy's collapse. A top Russian official responded immediately, saying that economic wars often turn into ""real wars."" The West has leveled sweeping sanctions against Russia that appear to be disrupting its economy. A top Russian official appeared to threaten France with ""real war"" on Tuesday as he responded to saber-rattling comments from the French finance minister about the effects of punitive Western sanctions. In an interview with French radio on Tuesday morning, Bruno Le Maire said the West aimed to ""cause the collapse of the Russian economy"" through an ""economic and financial war on Russia,"" for which the Russian population ""will also pay the consequences."" Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's former prime minister and now deputy chairman of its security council, was quick to respond on Twitter. He said: ""A French minister said today that they have declared an economic war on us. Watch what you say, gentlemen! And don't forget that in the history of mankind, economic wars have often turned into real wars."" Western nations including France have imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia, targeting everything from its central bank and leading financial institutions to President Vladimir Putin himself. The sanctions seem to have already disrupted the Russian economy. On Monday, the value of the ruble crashed by as much as 30% against the US dollar, forcing Russia's central bank to more than double its base interest rate to 20%. Meanwhile, Russians were pictured at ATMs trying to withdraw foreign currency. In the interview with France Info on Tuesday, Le Maire said that economic and financial sanctions leveled by the West against Russia were ""extremely effective,"" adding: ""I don't want to leave any ambiguity about the determination of Europe on this subject. We are going to wage an economic and financial war on Russia."" He continued: ""We want to target the heart of the Russian system. We'll target Vladimir Putin. We'll target the oligarchs. But we'll also target the entire Russian economy."" He added: ""Sanctions must strike fast, strike hard, and we are already seeing the effects. The ruble has collapsed by 30%. Russian foreign-exchange reserves are melting like snow in the sun, and Vladimir Putin's famous war chest has already reduced to almost nothing."" Le Maire said, ""We are going to cause the collapse of the Russian economy."" On Monday, the US rolled out sanctions intended to prevent Putin from accessing a $630 billion foreign-exchange ""war chest"" he could use to prop up Russia's battered economy. The move followed analogous sanctions from the European Union and the UK.

3/3/2022,"The Belarusian president may have shared on live TV Russia's plan of attack for Ukraine. Alexander Lukashenko showed ""what looks like an actual invasion map,"" a reporter tweeted. The map also showed Ukraine divided into four sections. Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko may have accidentally shared Russia's invasion plans for Ukraine on live television. A short video shared by the Belarusian journalist Tadeusz Giczan on Twitter showed Lukashenko pointing to a map of Ukraine that shows it segmented into four parts. Giczan called it ""what looks like an actual invasion map."" Lukashenko is an authoritarian and longtime ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""I thank these guys,"" Lukashenko said, though it was unclear who he was referring to. ""They warned us, and literally, six hours before the launch of the missiles, we discovered this."" Russia's Iskander tactical missile system was ""located here, right?"" he added. At that point, someone off-screen says, ""In the Mazyr area,"" referring to a Belarusian city. ""In the Mazyr area,"" Lukashenko said. ""We hit these rockets, these positions. And we haven't seen them afterward. During the offensive of the Russians in Ukraine, we already did not see them from the position. That's why I'm saying, yes, we have made launches from the territory of Belarus, and I told, frankly, which positions we targeted. Sit down."" Lukashenko's map shows red arrows from Belarus and Russian that point deep into Ukraine, with a pincer over Kyiv (the country's beseiged capital) and others that reach from the east all the way to the Dnieper river in the country's heart. The video appeared to be published by a Belarusian pro-state Telegram channel. —Tadeusz Giczan 🇺🇦 (@TadeuszGiczan) March 1, 2022 Ukraine's parliament said on Tuesday that Belarusian troops had entered the Chernihiv region in northern Ukraine, near the country's border with Belarus. It said the information was confirmed by Vitaliy Kyrylov, spokesperson for the North Territorial Defense Forces of Ukraine. The development came hours after Lukashenko told state news media that his country's troops were not joining Russia in its attack on Ukraine. A US defense official told reporters on Tuesday there was ""no confirmation that the Belarusians are entering Ukraine, we've seen no indication of that,"" according to Politico. Tuesday marked the sixth day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which prompted protests around the world, including in Russia. Western nations have since levied heavy sanctions and other restrictive financial measures against Russia, in moves strongly condemned by the Kremlin. Lukashenko, often referred to as ""Europe's last dictator,"" is an authoritarian who has been in power since 1994. He is widely considered to be a puppet of Putin and relies heavily on the Kremlin's support to stay in power. There were mass protests against Lukashenko in Belarus in 2020 after he won a sixth term in an election widely regarded as rigged. The Belarusian leader faced global condemnation last year for grounding a Ryanair flight (which was escorted into Minsk, Belarus' capital, with a fighter jet), citing a security threat, to arrest a prominent dissident. Experts said Lukashenko would not have engaged in such a brazen move without Putin's permission. Lukashenko is now Putin's closest ally in Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.

3/3/2022,"Fox News’ national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin again called out her own network’s questionable coverage of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. On Sunday, Griffin slammed retired U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Donald Bolduc’s on-air suggestion that America should provide more “combat help” to Ukraine as being “way off the mark in terms of talking about what the U.S. could do on the ground.” U.S. and NATO don’t have soldiers fighting in Ukraine amid fears it could spark a nuclear war, Griffin noted. “The Ukrainians are very good fighters,” she said. “They are a tough group of fighters. They do not need Americans to fight for them. That would cause this to spread.” “Clearly, Brig. Gen. Bolduc is not a student of history,” she continued. “He’s a politician. He ran for Senate in New Hampshire and failed. He’s not a military strategist, and to suggest that the U.S. would put indirect fire or special operations or CIA on the ground to give Putin any sort of excuse to broaden this conflict is extremely dangerous talk at a time like this.” Watch the video here: More fact checking of guests from Jennifer Griffin: Clearly he isn’t a student of history.

3/3/2022,"Jimmy Kimmel did not seem overly enthused about President Joe Biden’s first State of the Union address Tuesday night, calling it a “tough speech” and joking that he “probably could’ve just saved himself some time and just tweeted that the State of the Union is ‘malarkey AF.’” “The state of our union is about as strong as Kim and Kanye right now,” the late-night host added, noting that “not every lawmaker showed up to watch the speech, which is not the usual.” “One of those who opted out tonight was Florida Senator Marco Rubio,” Kimmel continued, explaining that the Republican lawmaker skipped the speech because he didn’t want to take the required COVID test. “I don’t have time to go take a COVID test today,” Rubio complained earlier in the day. “I only take a test if I’m sick.” “Which, since you can have and spread COVID without any symptoms, is an incredibly stupid thing to say,” Kimmel said in response. “But, in fairness, that is what Marco Rubio does. He is very on-brand. You know why he won’t do it, right? You know why he won’t take it? Because if they swab his nose, it would probably test positive for Donald Trump’s butt.” Andy Cohen Gives Emotional Rebuke of Texas Gov.
