2/27/2022,"International scientists on Saturday released two major studies which one participant said made it “extraordinarily clear” a market in Wuhan, China was the source of the coronavirus which fueled the Covid-19 pandemic – and not a Chinese government laboratory, a theory championed in the US by rightwing campaigners, columnists and politicians. The question of where Covid-19 came from and how it spread has proved divisive. According to Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, after two years the global death toll stands at more than 5.9m, the caseload at 433.7m. The same sources say more than 947,000 people have died of Covid in the US, from a caseload of nearly 79m. In August last year, a US intelligence review of the issue proved inconclusive. The New York Times first reported the new studies, which it said had not been published in any journal. Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona and a co-author on both studies, told the paper: “When you look at all of the evidence together, it’s an extraordinarily clear picture that the pandemic started at the Huanan market.” The one-sentence summary of one study said: “Geographical clustering of the earliest known Covid-19 cases and the proximity of positive environmental samples to live-animal vendors suggest that the Huanan seafood wholesale market in Wuhan was the site of origin of the Covid-19 pandemic.” In the abstract to the other study, scientists said: “Understanding the circumstances that lead to pandemics is critical to their prevention.” However, the issue of Chinese culpability or otherwise has become both diplomatically sensitive and highly politicised, particularly in the US. Particularly visibly, Dr Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to Joe Biden, has clashed repeatedly with Republican senators prominently including Rand Paul of Kentucky, a champion of the lab origin theory. In July 2021, Paul grilled Fauci about “gain of function” research on viruses in Chinese laboratories, and whether US funding of such research might have contributed to the Covid pandemic. Fauci replied: “Senator Paul, you do not know what you are talking about, quite frankly. And, I want to say that officially. You do not know what you are talking about.” The two clashed again in January this year, Fauci accusing Paul of fundraising off his attacks and “kindling the crazies”, fueling threats to him and his family. The studies released on Saturday were co-authored by scientists in the US, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, the UK (Oxford, Edinburgh and Glasgow), Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium.",News/World news,"Coronavirus came from Wuhan market and not Chinese lab, twin studies say",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/coronavirus-wuhan-market-chinese-lab-studies
2/27/2022,"The barricade started as a few men waiting nervously in the road on Friday, and grew gradually over the course of Saturday. By the afternoon, this modest attempt to stop a Russian advance on the capital of Ukraine was complete: sandbags, wooden crates and bricks piled high, with a blue-yellow national flag flying above them. The motley crew had no illusions about the level of resistance they would be able to offer to one of the world’s most ruthless and technologically advanced armies, but like thousands in and around Kyiv they were determined to do what they could anyway. “I practised shooting yesterday and I came out here today for my first shift. I’ll be honest, I’m terrified,” said Alexander, 50. He was brandishing a US-made Remington shotgun he said a friend had acquired for him. “Of course, if it’s a tank, in this terrain there’s nothing we can do and we need to run. But if it’s anything less than a tank, we will fight.” It was a promise kept by citizens across the capital, as the unthinkable became their reality, and the horror of modern warfare started ripping buildings and lives apart. For two nights Russia had thrown missiles, fighter jets and crack troops at the Ukrainian capital, apparently expecting a rapid capitulation, but Kyiv fought back. The mood was captured by President Volodomyr Zelenskiy, who posted video updates from the streets of the capital with top officials, attacking false news reports saying that he had fled. When US officials offered to pull him out of the city, he told them “The fight is here: I need ammunition, not a ride,” US media reported. Recruiting stations were overwhelmed by citizens of all ages, some well into their retirement, signing up to take weapons for the fight. “I planned to plant tulips and daffodils on my backyard today. Instead, I learn to fire arms and get ready for the next night of attacks on Kyiv,” said MP Kira Rudik on Twitter. “We are not going anywhere. This is our city, our land, our soil. We will fight for it. So next week I can plant my flowers. Here.” Others followed government instructions to start stockpiling molotov cocktails, hunt for Russian saboteurs and, beyond the city centre, take down road signs to confuse an invading army. Yet despite the success holding off the initial Russian onslaught, including during a pitched battle on the main Peremohy or victory avenue, Kyiv braced for worse on Saturday evening after Russia announced it had ordered troops to resume their offensive. In preparation, the metro stopped running, with stations to be used only as air raid shelters, and a curfew brought in from 5pm on Saturday until Monday morning, the mayor announced. Anyone on the streets in that time would be considered a saboteur and could be shot. Bridges across the river Dniepr, which divides the city, were also closed in preparation. Fuel is now scarce in and around Kyiv and most petrol stations are either out of petrol or are selling it only to Ukrainian soldiers who present identification. “The capture of Kyiv remains Russia’s primary military objective,” Britain’s defence ministry said in an intelligence briefing. It also said Russia’s advance was slowed “likely as a result of acute logistical difficulties and strong Ukrainian resistance”, but that large numbers of troops were now thought to be just 30 kilometres from the city. For many in Kyiv the reality of a Russian invasion still felt hard to grasp, even as they adjusted to nights in bunkers, mounting deaths and the images of civilian homes ripped apart by missile strikes. “It is impossible to imagine that my [aunt’s] mother, who lost her parents and became orphaned at seven, fought against Hitler with the Russian people, had to hide in a haystack from Nazi German soldiers, today, at the age of 85, is hiding in the basement in Kyiv from Russian soldiers,” said activist Valeriia Voshchevska. The ties between the two countries run so deep that the attack feels fratricidal to many, including the barricade defender Alexander. Born and raised in Russia, he later moved to Donetsk, where he ran a clothing shop until Russian-backed separatists seized the city in 2014, starting a conflict that laid the groundwork and provided the paper-thin excuse for this year’s invasion. Then, he moved to Kyiv, and now he was fighting forces sent from his former homeland. “I spoke to my cousin two days ago and he doesn’t understand anything. That will be our last conversation. I asked him: ‘Why are you so cowardly, your country is attacking us with ballistic missiles. Your own father is from Ukraine. Have you gone insane?’” The power of Russian propaganda narratives meant that there would be no point talking to Russians, except to scream “Get out occupier”, he said. Many unarmed Ukrainians have already risked doing exactly that, with several videos going viral of citizens screaming at recently arrived Russians, often in tirades laced with obscenities. Alexander’s checkpoint, at the entrance to a small village on the outskirts of Kyiv, was one of many that has sprung up on the approach roads to the Ukrainian capital over the past 48 hours, as Russian forces draw closer. None of those manning it were professional soldiers, and Alexander was one of the better-armed defenders. A few had shotguns, one had a pistol, cackling as he displayed its “Made in Russia” inscription. Others had no firearms at all, but said they would use knives, or a hammer. The checkpoint defenders had yet to catch sight of any Russian troops or armour, but said they had caught one suspicious man overnight who had been found carrying maps of the area and markers to use for later Russian targeting, and had arrested him and handed him over to police. In the city, people not heading for the front lines went underground as the curfew brought Saturday to an early end. Within an hour, blasts were once more echoing through the darkness, and the battle for Kyiv joined again.",News/World news,"Armed with hammers and pistols, Ukrainians wait at barricades for the Russians",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/armed-with-hammers-and-pistols-ukrainians-wait-at-barricades-for-the-russians
2/27/2022,"Vladimir Putin was facing growing international isolation and the prospect of pariah status on Saturday night as long-term allies dramatically turned against him following the invasion of Ukraine, and western nations planned further decisive military and financial action against Moscow. As his hopes of a quick victory evaporated in the face of fierce resistance by Ukrainian soldiers and armies of citizen volunteers, Russia’s president was deserted by his key ally, China, and had his ultimatum demanding Kyiv’s surrender defiantly brushed aside by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. In perhaps the most striking development, Germany announced on Saturday night that it would supply Ukrainian troops with 1,000 anti-tank weapons as well as 500 Stinger missiles from its own military reserves. “The Russian assault on Ukraine marks a turning point,” Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said, signalling a major shift in his country’s postwar military stance. “It threatens our entire postwar order. In this situation it is our duty to support Ukraine to the best of our ability in its defence against the invasive army of Vladimir Putin. Germany stands closely on the side of Ukraine.” Significantly, the German government was also said to be bowing to intense pressure from Britain, the US and Canada to ban Russia from the crucial Swift banking payments system after repeated appeals from Kyiv for the west to do so. Sources in Berlin said German ministers’ views were shifting on the issue and they were actively discussing measures that “would hit the right people”, having previously resisted, partly because of fears that a ban would affect the flow of funds to aid agencies in Russia. In further blows to Putin, Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orbán, long seen as friendly towards Moscow, abandoned his support, saying he would back all EU sanctions against Russia, while Turkey was reported to be considering blocking the passage of Russian naval vessels into the Black Sea. As a global diplomatic outcry intensified, Russia’s defence ministry ominously announced it was ordering “all units to advance in all sectors” as it accused Ukraine of refusing to negotiate. And in a desperate attempt to restore a positive narrative in the information war, the Kremlin banned street protests and restricted access to social media such as Facebook. A growing list of Russian celebrities and influencers announced they backed global efforts to stop the war. Having held off Russian forces for two nights, morale in Kyiv remained high among Ukrainians of all ages and from all walks of life, as many queued to take up arms. Many also gleefully shared videos of unarmed civilians rushing into the road to stop advancing convoys and fearlessly berating Russian soldiers about why they had come to Ukraine. Around the country, Russian forces were not confirmed as having control of a single major city, while Zelenskiy remained in Kyiv and told Americans who offered to evacuate him: “The fight is here. I need ammunition, not a ride.” Adding to the sense of crisis enveloping the Kremlin, the US said it would send a further $350m (£260m) of military assistance to Ukraine, taking its total for the past 12 months to more than $1bn; Nato moved more troops and weaponry to eastern member states bordering Russia and Belarus; and a sporting boycott mushroomed, with Russia facing a ban from motor racing and Poland refusing to play a World Cup game . YouTube barred the Russian state-owned media outlet RT and other Russian channels from receiving money for advertisements that run with their videos. Opposition to the invasion also spilled over into the UK’s Premier League football programme. At the game between Manchester City and Everton, the Everton players came out draped in Ukrainian flags while Manchester City wore shirts bearing the words “No War”. The head coach of Chelsea, which is owned by the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich – who last week was named in parliament as one of 35 oligarchs and “enablers” of the Putin regime – even suggested that he would be “happy to lose” Sunday’s Carabao Cup final against Liverpool. “Given the situation, that we have a war, this is simply not important enough,” said Thomas Tuchel. “It unfortunately will not help, but, if it would, I am happy to lose the match.” On Saturday night, Abramovich announced he was handing “stewardship” of the club to the trustees of its charitable foundation. In London, the Ministry of Defence announced that Challenger 2 tanks and armoured vehicles from the Royal Welsh Battlegroup had arrived in Estonia from Germany, with further equipment and about 1,000 troops following over the coming days. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said the aim was to stop invasions of Nato member states: “Alongside our Nato allies, these deployments constitute a credible deterrent to stop Russian aggression threatening the territorial sovereignty of member states.” On Saturday, Russian advances on major cities, including Kyiv, appeared to have slowed or ground to a halt. Ukraine’s defence ministry claimed Russia had suffered more than 3,000 casualties and that many other soldiers had been captured. UK and other diplomats said a decision by China to abstain rather than back its ally Russia in a UN resolution on the invasion was being viewed as a huge victory for the west. Beijing called on both Moscow and Kyiv to find a negotiated settlement. Ukraine’s health minister reported on Saturday that 198 people had been killed, including three children, and that more than 1,000 others had been wounded since the Russian offensive started before dawn on Thursday with massive air and missile strikes and troops forging into Ukraine from the north, east and south. Among the Kyiv buildings hit in the latest wave of Russian strikes was a high-rise residential building. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, posted an image showing a gaping hole in one side of the building and damaged apartments on several floors.",News/World news,Putin shunned by world as his hopes of quick victory evaporate,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/the-world-shuns-pariah-putin
2/27/2022,"The National Gallery’s partnership with Credit Suisse has been thrown into question after leaked documents revealed the hidden wealth of the bank’s criminal clients, including drug traffickers, money launderers and corrupt politicians. Credit Suisse, headquartered in Zurich, has sponsored the National Gallery since 2008 in one of the UK’s biggest arts funding deals. The partnership, renewed in 2020 and due to run until at least 2024, means Credit Suisse’s name is linked to exhibitions for artists from Raphael and Monet to Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci. But the gallery, which houses more than 2,300 works at its landmark location in London’s Trafalgar Square, is facing scrutiny over the arrangement in light of revelations about its sponsor last week. The “Swiss secrets” leak involved data relating to 30,000 clients and revealed that Credit Suisse opened or maintained accounts for high-risk individuals, including a human trafficker in the Philippines, a Hong Kong stock-exchange boss jailed for bribery, executives who looted Venezuela’s state oil company, and corrupt politicians from Egypt to Ukraine. The findings, published by a coalition of news outlets including the Guardian, point to widespread failings of due diligence by Credit Suisse in what is the latest in a string of scandals to embroil the Swiss bank. Credit Suisse – which says it “strongly rejects the allegations and insinuations”​​ – is currently on trial in Switzerland facing charges that staff failed to stop money laundering by drug traffickers, allegedly involving cash deposited in suitcases. It is defending the charges and denies any wrongdoing. In October 2021, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority fined the bank £147m for serious financial crime due diligence failings related to loans worth over $1.3bn, which the bank arranged for Mozambique and the regulator says were “tainted by corruption”. The National Gallery, a publicly funded body sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, says its partnership with Credit Suisse has provided “vital funding” for its exhibitions and learning programmes, including its work with schoolchildren. But its ethical sponsorship policy states that it must consider the potential for harm in cases where “the source of a gift or sponsorship is alleged to have participated in illegal activities, including financial crime”. Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies at the RUSI (Royal United Services Institute) thinktank, said it was extremely difficult for institutions like the National Gallery, because “on the face of it, Credit Suisse should be an entirely legitimate funder”. But he said the Credit Suisse leaks “point to a more systemic issue in the bank as opposed to just a couple of rogue dudes”. “At what point do we switch from a few rogue transactions to a rogue bank? That has to be a question that beneficiaries of sponsorship should be thinking about,” he said. Michelle Wright, the founder of Cause4, a social enterprise that supports charities, and programme director of the Arts Fundraising and Philanthropy programme, said the Credit Suisse partnership had delivered great things but that the National Gallery needed to consider whether it could defend it in light of the recent revelations. “They should be reviewing this because there is now reputational risk to that sponsorship,” she said. The National Gallery declined to comment on the revelations about Credit Suisse but said its development department, which is in charge of fundraising, adhered to the ethical policy, which it keeps under review. Credit Suisse declined to comment on the partnership with the gallery. In relation to the leaks, a spokesperson said: “This appears to be a concerted effort to discredit not only the bank but the Swiss financial marketplace, which has undergone significant changes over the last several years.” “While Credit Suisse cannot comment on potential client relationships, we can confirm that actions, including account closures, have been taken in line with applicable policies and regulatory requirements at the relevant times. ​Our strategy puts risk management at the very core of our business.” The controversy comes at a turbulent time for the arts and raises wider questions around ethical funding, with other cultural institutions recently thrust into the spotlight over their links to controversial companies. Last week, the National Portrait Gallery announced it was cutting ties with the oil giant BP after three decades following years of protests by climate activists. Other organisations, including the Tate and the Royal Shakespeare Company, had already ended their relationships with the firm, while the British Museum continues to receive funding and has announced no plans to change that. Several institutions have also removed the Sackler family’s name in recent months over members of the family’s role in the opioid crisis that claimed thousands of lives. Wright said there was “so much risk in this area” for institutions. “The artistic community is very, very sensitive on where money for their art comes from, and many of them are publicly-accessible, so they’re in the public eye,” she said. She called for a “joined-up approach” on polarising issues to ensure the arts sector did not become “too hot to touch” for corporate sponsors. “What happens at the moment is that there’s a spotlight on an individual organisation and frankly, the chief executives of other organisations are wiping their brows and thinking: ‘Thank goodness it’s not us.’ ”",News/News,London’s National Gallery under pressure over links to Credit Suisse,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/26/londons-national-gallery-under-pressure-over-links-to-credit-suisse
2/27/2022,"Tensions between the mayor of London and the Home Office are likely to intensify as both unveil what they are claiming as the UK’s first major campaigns to target perpetrators of sexual harassment and violence. Football stars, other sports figures, celebrities and influencers have been enrolled by Sadiq Khan to speak to men via billboards and video to address “pervasive misogynistic attitudes”, which experts say if left unchecked can allow harmful behaviours to escalate. The home secretary, Priti Patel, promised a similar campaign targeting perpetrators more than seven months ago, prompting calls from campaigners for immediate action and then frustration as it failed to materialise. The first strand of that campaign is set to launch this week with adverts, billboards, social media and radio advertising highlighting “the simple acts that anyone can take to challenge perpetrators of abuse”. Patel will also announce that tackling violence against women and girls will be made a strategic policing requirement. This means the issue will be a national priority for forces alongside terrorism, serious and organised crime and child sexual abuse. Patel said: “The safety of women and girls is an absolute priority and I do not accept that violence against them is inevitable.” Her comments arrive days before the first anniversary of the abduction of Sarah Everard by a serving Metropolitan police officer as she walked home in south London. Latest data reveals that more than 20% of UK women say they have been a victim of sexual assault, with 14% aged 16 to 19 a victim of domestic abuse. In 2020, 99% of adult offenders sentenced or cautioned for sexual offences in London were men. Khan said: “This is not just an issue with the minority of men who are violent, but with men who are sexist, who behave inappropriately around women, who perpetuate a toxic form of masculinity or who just stand by silently when women feel threatened or are being threatened. Men must change.” Relations between Khan and Patel have been taut following the recent resignation of Cressida Dick after the London mayor told the head of the Met Police he had lost faith in her, leaving the home secretary to claim his intervention had “blindsided” her. Last night, women’s groups welcomed Khan’s decision to launch a separate campaign targeting men. Suzanne Jacob, the chief executive of SafeLives, said: “For the longest time, boys and men have been left outside the conversation about violence against girls and women. We are so encouraged and pleased to see this changing.” Andrea Simon, director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: “We welcome this important work to reframe narratives around violence against women and girls, putting the focus where it belongs – on perpetrators.”",News/Society,Khan and Patel to clash over campaigns to protect women ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/26/khan-and-patel-to-clash-over-campaigns-to-protect-women
2/27/2022,"The names of thousands of companies which benefited from billions of pounds of Covid-19 loans schemes are to be kept confidential under new government rules to only publish state subsidies of £500,000 or more. The higher threshold has been brought in after Brexit despite warnings that it may hamper the fight against fraudsters believed to have plundered billions from the schemes. The loan schemes have been called a “bonanza for fraudsters”. Under the EU rules in force until the end of 2020, all pandemic business loans above €100,000 were required to be publicly disclosed with details of the recipients. The new £500,000 threshold for public disclosure of state aid, including pandemic loans, applies from 1 January 2021 and is set out in the government’s subsidy control bill which is going through parliament. The disclosure rules mean the vast majority of businesses which claim loans will never be revealed. Only 3% of businesses which claimed support under the bounce back loan scheme, the biggest scheme, are expected to be named, according to the British Business Bank, the government-owned bank which delivered the support. The treasury minister Lord Agnew resigned at the dispatch box in the Lords last month over what he described as a series of “schoolboy errors” in fighting fraud. He said the loans regime was more vulnerable to fraud because of a mix of “arrogance, indolence and ignorance.” It has been estimated by the government that about £4.9bn was lost in fraud to the bounce back scheme which provided loans up to £50,000 to smaller businesses. Ministers have not published figures for estimated fraud losses for two other schemes, the coronavirus large business interruption loan scheme and the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme. Loans worth nearly £80bn were distributed to businesses across the UK between 23 March 2020 and 31 March 2021. The government faces a challenge under freedom of information laws by the campaign group Spotlight on Corruption which submitted a request last July for details of all the recipients of the loan schemes. The British Business Bank refused to release those details, warning that identifying companies may have an adverse impact on trading. The Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) upheld the decision to refuse the information, but the campaign group is appealing. George Havenhand, of Spotlight on Corruption, said: “Covid loans were a bonanza for fraudsters. Publishing those names would support the government’s efforts to recoup the money lost to fraud and increase accountability for this national scandal.” The ICO’s refusal decision in December 2021 said under a temporary EU framework all UK loans granted in 2020 were required to be publicly disclosed where they were above €100,000 (or above €10,000 for farming or fisheries). From 1 January 2021 under the UK’s post-Brexit regime, companies in England, Wales and Scotland are only required to disclose loans at or above £500,000. Loans in Northern Ireland remain under the EU reporting regime under article 10 of the Northern Ireland protocol. The legal challenge has highlighted concerns that the transparency requirements of the new subsidy control bill are inadequate. EU state aid is typically disclosed at a threshold of €500,000, a threshold which was reduced for the pandemic loans. Campaigners want ministers to introduce tougher rather than weaker transparency requirements for the UK outside the EU and are calling for all subsidies at a threshold of £500 to be disclosed. Peers have supported an amendment to the bill in the Lords to reduce it to this level. Anna Powell-Smith, the director of the Centre for Public Data, a data transparency group campaigning for the lower threshold for disclosure, said: “The subsidy control bill reforms how the UK awards grants and loans to businesses after Brexit, but it also makes subsidies less transparent, for no clear reason. “The law should require all subsidies over £500 to be published. This will help prevent cronyism and fraudand has support across the political spectrum.”Officials at the British Business Bank say the government’s higher reporting threshold for pandemic support will only affect loans over a three-month period because the three schemes closed on 31 March 2021.",News/Business,Names of firms given huge Covid loans will be secret,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/26/names-of-firms-given-huge-covid-loans-will-be-secret
2/27/2022,"It was the silence in the House of Commons – more than the words spoken from the dispatch box – that captured the magnitude of the moment, and the dramatic shift of political mood, on Thursday evening. Boris Johnson had been woken at 4.10am that morning to be told Vladimir Putin’s troops had crossed the border into Ukraine. It was what military intelligence had prepared him to expect. But Putin’s chilling warning that any resistance would bring consequences “never seen in history” brought home the threat not just to Ukraine as a sovereign nation but to peace in Europe and the entire world. By 4.30am, the prime minister was up and on the phone from Downing Street to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, offering solidarity and support. An aide summed up Johnson’s mood as “motivated, anxious, moved and energetic”. He addressed the British people at noon before turning again to a reinforced package of sanctions against Moscow. As he did so he seized on a new three-word slogan – “Putin must fail” – which he would use repeatedly at cabinet that evening. At Westminster, however, by mid-morning, MPs of all parties were wandering around parliament, disorientated and fearful. It was just weeks since the Tory party had been consumed by talk of Johnson being subjected to a vote of confidence over the “partygate” affair as opposition MPs and leaders accused him of being a serial rule-breaker and liar unfit to occupy Downing Street. Every appearance by the prime minister in the Commons for weeks before had turned the chamber into a bear pit. To underline the descent of British politics, a week ago No 10 confirmed the prime minister had completed and returned a questionnaire he had been sent by Scotland Yard about gatherings in Downing Street that appeared to have taken place in breach of lockdown rules. Despite it all, Johnson had been determined to soldier on and turn things round on the domestic front. On Monday, he announced the end of all remaining Covid-19 restrictions in England, saying it was time to take the country “back towards normality”. But when he rose to address MPs at 5pm on Thursday, there was nothing normal – at least compared with recent times – about the House of Commons or British politics. The chamber was packed but eerily quiet as hundreds of MPs from different parties sat motionless. Within 15 minutes, it was clear that unseemly political arguments of recent times had been subsumed and rendered irrelevant – at least for the time being. One Tory MP and former minister, himself a critic of the prime minister who had wanted him to quit over partygate until a few days ago, said afterwards: “The enormity of what has happened in Ukraine has transcended party politics. There was a sense of seriousness and shared endeavour that just took over from everything.” The prime minister was heard in respectful silence. So, too, was the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, and –more remarkably – the Scottish National party’s Ian Blackford, whose every utterance is normally met with jeers from opponents. Johnson told MPs that Putin was “hurling the might of his military machine against a free and peaceful neighbour in breach of his own explicit pledge and every principle of civilised behaviour between states”. To everyone who made the connection, this was rule-breaking on an entirely different scale from that which Westminster had recently obsessed about. “Talking about parties any more would be ridiculous. It would sound utterly trivial,” remarked a senior Labour MP. When the Labour leader responded to Johnson’s speech announcing new sanctions, he avoided any hint of criticism. Instead he sought joint occupation of the high ground alongside the prime minister, declaring that “all of us who believe in democracy over dictatorship, in the rule of law over the reign of terror and in freedom over the jackboot of tyranny must unite and take a stand”. For Starmer, there was nothing to be gained from scoring political points against Johnson. Rather, by playing the patriotic, pro-Nato, anti-Putin cards, any gain there was lay in distancing himself from his predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, and those on the left of the party associated with the Stop the War movement. Unity prevailed across the chamber. Starmer said that if the prime minister legislated with the intention of “cracking open the shell companies” in which “Putin and his fellow bandits” had hidden money stolen from the Russian people, then Labour would support him. As he did so, Johnson looked up and nodded his agreement. As one Labour frontbencher put it, these were moments when domestic politics was suspended and the beneficiary, in narrow, short-term political terms, was clearly Johnson. “What is happening is that we are entering a period of quasi-national government which we had early on in the pandemic. That benefits the incumbent and makes it difficult for the opposition to do what we are here to do, which is to show up points of difference with the government.” In Downing Street, insiders say the mood is transformed from three weeks ago. Then there was a sense of chaos and decay as advisers quit and Tory MPs threatened to topple Johnson. Now, with a new team in place and a new enemy, at least there is a clear focus and an emerging strategy. Just as Margaret Thatcher revived her flagging fortunes in 1982 by going to war with Argentina in the Falklands, boosting her poll ratings by 10 points as a result, Johnson and his allies can see opportunities to recharge and rescue his leadership from what appeared to be impending disaster, off the back of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This weekend, Johnson’s allies are pointing out, at every opportunity, that it is the prime minister who is pressing the case hardest for Russia to be cut out of the international payments system Swift, as demanded by Kyiv. They say other G7 and world leaders, particularly Germany, are holding out against the move, fearing the economic and other consequences of taking such draconian action against Putin and his regime. This weekend Johnson is hitting the phones from Chequers, making the case again to fellow leaders and hoping to portray himself soon as a victor on the world stage in a key battle over sanctions. In the same breath, Johnson’s aides point out that he wants to use the crisis to demonstrate that the UK can exert more influence – not less – in foreign affairs now it is outside the EU, a view not widely shared in the Foreign Office. In addition, he sees a chance to put in action a plan to ensure that the UK moves faster in reducing reliance on Russian and other foreign supplies of energy by investing ever more heavily in renewables at home. But if some clear strategic lines are emerging from Downing Street, Tory MPs know an awful lot will need to go right for Johnson over the coming, dangerous months for him to repeat Thatcher’s revival. Whatever happens with Russia and Ukraine, whether the crisis escalates or not, the police will, some time in the next few weeks, issue the findings of their inquiries into partygate, which could see the prime minister fined for attending a string of events that breached Covid rules. Then the full report by the senior civil servant Sue Gray will be published, which could further criticise the prime minister. Much could come down to timing. As one former Tory minister said: “Downing Street will be praying that the reports come as soon as possible before the focus goes off Ukraine. I think that if they come in the next couple of weeks, he’s safe. No party would change their leader with this going on.” Another Tory MP warned that the cost of living crisis was certain to worsen as a result of a prolonged conflict – as energy bills rise still higher – with adverse effects on the longer-term popularity of the Johnson government. “There are a lot of booby-traps to come,” he said. “We have tax rises in April, and energy prices soaring. All as we approach the May local elections. He is by no means out of the woods.” The latest Opinium poll for the Observer shows Johnson remains deeply unpopular and widely distrusted. Asked whether, in the light of events in Ukraine, they thought he could be “trusted to take big decisions” just 25% said he could be, while 56% said he could not. Just 24% thought he was a strong leader, while 53% did not; and 30% believed he could stand up for Britain abroad, while 47% did not. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought about a sudden transformation – a ceasefire - in British politics and eased the immediate domestic crisis for Johnson, at least for now. But it has also created a more dangerous world, one in which global economic problems will worsen and prices will rise faster and further, only adding to the problems and risks for democratically elected leaders everywhere, particularly ones who already lack much public support – such as the current occupant of No 10.",News/World news,From partygate to Putin’s war: Boris Johnson rides on a rare wave of unity ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/partygate-putin-war-boris-johnson-ukraine-crisis-prime-minister
