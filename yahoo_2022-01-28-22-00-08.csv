1/28/2022,"Losing weight requires being in a calorie deficit, whether you count calories or not. When I lost 35 pounds three years ago, I made simple adjustments to how I ate that didn't leave me feeling deprived. Try swapping pork sausages for turkey or crisps for salted popcorn. Losing weight requires eating in a calorie deficit, which means consuming less energy than you burn through your daily life and exercise. You don't need to count calories, but it worked for me when I lost 35 pounds three years ago, and have kept it off since. Losing fat doesn't require cutting out any specific foods, it's about managing your overall food intake. Experts don't recommend restricting your diet either by eating too little or cutting out your favorite foods altogether. ""It is important that you don't drastically drop your calories too low so you can sustain this while feeling energetic and remaining healthy with a strong immune system,"" personal trainer Hayley Madigan previously told Insider. Fat loss coach Jordan Syatt previously told Insider he suggests aiming for 2-6 lbs a month. When I want to lose weight, I make simple food swaps that help me reduce my calories while still keeping me satisfied. 1. Greek yogurt for sour cream Next time you make fajitas, swap out the sour cream for fat-free Greek yogurt: The former is 187 calories per 100ml, compared to 54 calories for the yogurt. 2. Bagel thins for bagels Bagel thins are exactly what they sound like: thinner bagels, and they're still delicious. While an average bagel is usually 230-300 calories, bagel thins usually come in at around 130, saving you at least 100 calories. Some people recommend swapping out bread for rice cakes, but I personally find rice cakes not very tasty, and thinner slices of bread are more satisfying to me. 3. Powdered peanut butter for regular Powdered peanut butter is essentially peanut butter with the oil removed. You simply mix it with a little water until you reach your desired consistency. It doesn't have the same texture as regular peanut butter, and so it isn't quite as delicious to me. But it's a swap I make sometimes because I still enjoy powdered peanut butter, and the choice aligns with my goals. Normal peanut butter is around 188 cals per 2 tsp serving, but powdered, however, is about 60 calories for the same amount. 4. Turkey sausages for pork Turkey (or chicken) sausages are leaner than pork, coming in at around 160 calories rather than about 340 for two. 5. Turkey meatballs for beef Turkey meatballs are just like sausages, but have less calories than their beef counterpart: Three beef meatballs contain around 190 calories, whereas turkey ones are about 125 for three. 6. Turkey bacon for pork bacon For me, not all swaps are worth it. While some people recommend replacing spaghetti with zucchini noodles and burger buns with lettuce leaves, I personally prefer to still have the carbs— just in smaller quantities. Turkey bacon instead of pork bacon is a swap I'm happy to make as I enjoy both equally, and a slice of turkey bacon is 34 calories each, compared to 50-70 for an average slice of bacon. 7. Replacing some eggs for egg whites in omelettes and scrambles Egg whites are very low calorie, but instead of making frittatas, omelettes, scrambles and pancakes with them alone, I like to do a mix of whites and whole eggs for the best of both worlds. 3 tbsp or 45g of egg whites is 22 calories, equivalent to one medium egg which is about 70 calories. 8. Diet drinks instead of regular ones An obvious one, but swapping regular soda for a diet version can cut out 139 calories per serving. When I want an alcoholic drink, opting for gin and slimline tonic keeps the calories down (and is also delicious, in my opinion). 9. Skimmed milk in coffees If you're a fan of milky drinks like lattes, flat whites, and cappuccinos, opting for skimmed rather than whole milk can take your drink's calorie count from 228 to 128, roughly. 10. Salted popcorn over chips (or lower calorie chips) Popcorn is actually very low calorie when it's not covered in sugar, syrup, or butter. Next time you get a craving for chips, try some lightly salted popcorn. A 17g individual bag of salted popcorn is around 84 calories, compared to 123 calories for a 25g individual packet of salted chips. Popcorn is a high volume, light food, so a portion is typically lighter in weight for the same size. One of the simplest ways to reduce calories is to choose smaller portions — a small tub of popcorn rather than a large, for example. ""One thing that can be done is to try and half portion sizes of these particular items that you have labeled as 'guilty pleasures,'"" registered nutritionist Rhiannon Lambert previously told Insider. ""Of course, there's no reason to feel guilty, but instead of having three scoops of ice cream, have two, instead of having a whole dessert, share half with a partner."" 11. Fresh fruit over dried fruit A 40g serving of dried apricots, which is a small bag, is 72 calories. One fresh apricot is around 35g, and only 34 calories. Dried fruit is a lot smaller than fresh, so it's easier to eat more. The higher water content of fresh fruit makes it more filling. 12. Low fat over full fat yogurt While fat-free yogurt doesn't have quite the same creaminess of higher fat yogurt, it's still delicious and a lot lower in calories. Fat-free Greek yogurt is 54 calories per 100g, while the 5% fat yogurt equivalent is 93 calories for the same amount. 13. Cooking spray instead of oil or butter An easy way to drastically reduce the calories in your meals is to use smaller amounts of cooking oil or butter. 15ml of sunflower oil is 124 calories, so you can make your meals lighter by using less or low calorie cooking sprays instead. 14. Ground turkey instead of beef Ground turkey and chicken is leaner than beef and pork, so swapping out those meats can be a good way to lighten a bolognese or homemade burgers. Of course, you can also choose lower fat versions of other meats — I still eat beef and pork when losing weight, I just work them into my calories. 2% fat ground turkey breast is about 136 calories per 100g, meanwhile 20% fat ground beef is 273 calories for the same quantity. 15. Chicken breasts over thighs Chicken breasts are a lower calorie choice than thigh or wing meat: 100g of breast is 165 calories, compared to 209 for thigh and 203 for wing. 16. Low calorie ice cream instead of regular There are tons of low calorie ice creams on the market these days. Halo Top sea salt caramel ice cream, for example, is only 300 calories per pint. Ben & Jerry's triple caramel chunk ice cream is 1,100 calories per pint. Losing weight doesn't mean never having Ben & Jerry's, it might just mean having it a bit less often, or in smaller quantities. And lower calorie alternatives can help you hit your goals without feeling deprived.

1/28/2022,"Former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson appeared on CNN’s Democracy in Peril Thursday, where she spoke about the current condition of her former network. Carlson first spoke about the power opinion host Tucker Carlson seems to have over Republicans in Congress, some of whom have followed his lead and sided with authoritarian Russia in the growing conflict with Ukraine. “This is the result of fake news,” Carlson said. “You know, we're seeing not only the fallout from fake news during the Trump era, but what happened with the insurrection on January 6th. Now it's moving into other areas. Not just news, now it’s hitting science with vaccines, and now it’s into Cold War politics.” Carlson also addressed the fact that her former colleagues, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, sent texts to the White House during the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol pleading for former President Trump to stop the violence, but went on air and spun a different narrative about the events of that day. “I think the bigger story coming out of that is how disingenuous it was to be sending those texts of warning while then going on the air to the American people and doing a complete injustice and disservice by saying something completely opposite,” Carlson said, “and ginning up this whole reaction that it was just fine and patriotic for people to be there on January 6th.” Carlson went on to lament the current state of her former network. “Slowly but surely, this has morphed into eradicating any other point of view since the Trump era that is not just opinion,” Carlson said. “It's gone from an opinion, which was fine, to completely devolving into non fact-based conspiracy theories and outright dangerous rhetoric, in my mind, and I think it’s a complete disservice to our country.” Being sure to state her belief that this happens on both sides, as she had done a few times throughout the interview, Carlson spoke about the dangers of only watching one news source. In this context, Carlson was speaking about how she wishes more Republicans in power would speak out against some of the narratives pushed by Fox News rather than submit to them. “For the safety of the Republican Party and for our democracy, I wish more would, because this is not going to end well, in my mind,” Carlson said. “It's really hard to change people's opinions because they're only watching what they want to hear, you know? And that's the other problem that we have in society with the media right now, is that we're so siloed into only watching what we agree with. And so every day that thought process just gets reinforced time after time.” Carlson also said that conservative news is not what she once believed it to be. “Conservative television news is certainly not the conservative news that was out there even just five years ago,” Carlson said, later adding, “There’s a big difference between having a conservative opinion and having one that supports conspiracy theories.” For more check out CNN.com.

1/28/2022,"Mike Pence said he last spoke to Donald Trump last summer. He pointed to the Capitol riot, calling it ""difficult."" Some Trump supporters had called for Pence's death. But Pence said they ""parted amicably,"" mirroring how he recently downplayed the Capitol riot. Former Vice President Mike Pence said he had not spoken to former President Donald Trump since last summer, revealing the extent of the rift between the pair since the Capitol riot. When asked by Fox News' Jesse Watters on Thursday when he last spoke to Trump, Pence said: ""You know, we talked last summer. And you know I've said many times, it was difficult, January 6 was difficult. It was a tragic day in the life of the nation."" He continued: ""I know I did my duty under the constitution of the United States, but the president and I sat down in the days that followed that, we spoke about it, talked through it, we parted amicably."" Watch Pence speak here: —Jesse Watters Primetime (@jesseprimetime) January 28, 2022 The days running up to the January 6, 2021, Trump and his allies pressured Pence to reject the Electoral College vote and overturn President Joe Biden's election win. Some of the rioters who stormed the Capitol called for Pence's death while they were inside, chanting ""hang Mike Pence."" Pence has downplayed that experience. He recently described the event to the Christian Broadcasting Network as ""one tragic day in January"" and said it was being used to undermine Trump voters.

1/28/2022,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) — The Philippines will lift a ban on the entry of foreign tourists and businesspeople next month after nearly two years, in a move to revive the battered tourism industry as the latest coronavirus outbreak started to ease, officials said Friday. Tourism Secretary Berna Romulo-Puyat said the country will reopen its doors to travelers from more than 150 countries with visa-free privileges starting Feb. 10. Foreign travelers will no longer be required to quarantine in government-designated centers upon arrival if they have been fully vaccinated and tested negative prior to arrival, officials said. The government had initially planned to lift the ban on Dec. 1 but indefinitely postponed it as the more contagious omicron variant spread, which also prompted authorities to reimpose tighter restrictions. President Rodrigo Duterte warned that unvaccinated Filipinos who defy orders to stay at home could face arrest. Commuters who have not been immunized were also prohibited from public transport in the capital region of more than 13 million people unless on urgent errands, for at least up to the end of the month. The decision has sparking protests from human rights and labor groups. The number of daily infections has dropped considerably in the capital in recent days. “We’re done with border control,” Health Undersecretary Rosario Vergeire told a news conference, adding that government focus has shifted to preventing community transmission of the omicron variant, which has caused five deaths in the country so far. “We are also aware that there is no room for complacency given the unpredictability of the virus,” Puyat said. “We will closely monitor the situation and ensure that health and safety protocols are strictly implemented in all tourism establishments.” The number of tourists dropped by more than 6 million, and more than a million Filipinos lost their jobs in tourism businesses and destinations in the first year of the pandemic alone, according to government statistics. Tourism destinations, including popular beach and island resorts, resembled ghost towns at the height of pandemic lockdowns. The Philippines has reported more than 3.5 million confirmed COVID-19 infections, with 53,801 deaths, the second-highest totals in Southeast Asia after Indonesia.",World/Associated Press,Philippines lifts ban on foreign tourists as outbreak eases,https://news.yahoo.com/philippines-lifts-ban-foreign-tourists-093909536.html
