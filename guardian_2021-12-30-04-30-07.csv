12/30/2021,"My former teacher Nigel Johnson, who has died aged 86, taught English at schools in Anglesey, Germany and Cheshire over a 30-year career in which he was unusually dedicated to trying to bring out the best in his pupils. Nigel was born in Scarborough, where his parents, Phyllis (nee Birdsall) and Cecil Johnson, owned a women’s clothes shop. After attending Scarborough high school for boys, he did his national service in the Royal Navy.  He had cheated on the initial navy eye test by listening to other people’s answers as he sat in the queue outside, but was soon rumbled during a second test, and though he was admitted to the service he was never posted to sea, instead running a library at a naval base near Nuneaton. After national service he did a general arts degree at Durham University, where he was an avid rower, and followed up with a diploma in education. Graduating in 1960, he immediately married Ann Fletcher, a student teacher in Scarborough, and embarked on a career as an English teacher, beginning in Peterborough where he taught at Deacon’s school (now Thomas Deacon academy), before becoming head of English at HMS Conway, a naval boarding school in Anglesey, where he spent his free time sailing a dinghy on the Menai Straits and where he taught, among others, the future rugby coach Clive Woodward and future Conservative party leader Iain Duncan Smith. By 1967, he and Ann had three daughters. Although life in Angelsey was idyllic, Nigel soon got itchy feet and applied for a job with the British Forces Education Service. Instead of the dreamed-of Cyprus or Malta, in 1970 the Johnsons were dispatched to Cornwall school in Dortmund. For three years the family made the most of things by Volvo-ing across Germany, France and Spain on long camping trips. In 1973 Nigel moved to the independent Sandbach school in Cheshire, staying there for 10 years and producing annual school plays of a high standard: a highlight was Ibsen’s The Wild Duck, staged for the school’s 1977 tercentenary celebrations. Nigel took time to see the potential in students that others might have missed: I was one of many young people whose lives he changed for the better. In 1983 he went to Grange School in Hartford, also in Cheshire, and in 1990 he decided to take early retirement, aged 55. Nigel then moved to the Cornish coast, where he and Ann settled in Mylor Bridge near Falmouth. Inspired by John Hodgson, a former Sandbach colleague who had already retired to the area, he became a devoted sailor and spent the next 20 years messing about in boats, occasionally crossing the Channel to Brittany. Nigel and Ann divorced in 2009, and in 2010 he married Gill McNab, whom he had met in the church choir. Nigel remained active in retirement, volunteering at the National Maritime Museum, Falmouth, and compiling a volume of poems, People and Places, and a memoir, The Time of My Life. He was full of fun and curiosity and always wonderful company. Nigel is survived by Gill, by the three daughters, Sarah, Emma and Rachel, from his first marriage, and eight grandchildren, Oliver, James, Joseph, Anna, Sophie, Thomas, Marianne and Christian.",News/Education,Nigel Johnson obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/dec/29/nigel-johnson-obituary
12/30/2021,"Labour has demanded ministers explain why £330,000 of taxpayers’ money was spent on repairing a pothole-ridden road reportedly owned by a former Tory peer. Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling-up secretary, called on the government to say “how this happened and what steps are being taken to ensure it does not happen again”.  It came after the Daily Mail reported the money had been spent on improving the road on land owned by the eighth Viscount Gage. He inherited his title in 1993 and was removed from the House of Lords, alongside the majority of his fellow hereditary peers, in 1999. The lane leads to Charleston, an artists’ house and studio museum in the South Downs in East Sussex. According to the South East Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP), “the access track is currently in a poor condition due to drainage issues which have led to a broken surface with cracks and large potholes”. It added: “The poor quality of the access track discourages visitors from making repeat visits to Charleston and impacts on the ability of Charleston to grow their events and festivals programme.” Charleston received £89,293 from the government’s Getting Building Fund in November 2020, with an additional £240,542 granted the following July for a new cycle path and to resurface the entire access road. The Charleston Trust was the lead applicant, but according to a business case presented to the LEP for the second tranche of funding, the Firle Estate was also listed as a partner for “providing project coordination and advice in support of the project”. Gage manages the estate, according to its website. Nandy said she was surprised to learn about the use of taxpayers’ money in the context of Boris Johnson’s commitment to “levelling up”. She quoted Johnson stressing that the Getting Building Fund was designed to “finally tackle this country’s great unresolved challenges of the last three decades” and “mend the indefensible gap in opportunity and productivity and connectivity between the regions of the UK”. Nandy said: “Filling in potholes for a Conservative peer surely cannot have been what he meant.” She called for the release of the criteria that the decision was based on, and said that the government should demonstrate “taxpayer money was protected at all times”. In a letter to the levelling-up secretary, Michael Gove, Nandy added: “Chronic underfunding of our roads, rail and buses is a problem for millions of us. I hope you will be able to agree that government funding must be allocated fairly and opportunity spread far more widely than this egregious decision suggests.” A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Communities and Housing said the money had been allocated by the LEP, whose “independent evaluators assessed it as offering value for money”. They added: “Charleston is a charity-owned, internationally recognised site of cultural importance, with a museum and art gallery, and this work is estimated to provide a £1.6m boost to the local economy by creating jobs and increasing visitor numbers.” The Firle Estate was also contacted for comment.",News/Politics,Labour lambasts reported £330k award of public money to repair peer’s road,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/29/labour-lambasts-reported-330k-award-of-public-money-to-repair-ex-peers-road
12/30/2021,"If asked to name a news story linked to environmental protest in 2021, chances are that most British people would, depending on where they live, mention either the demonstrations alongside November’s climate conference in Glasgow, or (especially if they are in the London area) Insulate Britain. By blocking roads including the M25 on multiple occasions between September and November, the members of this new campaign group barged into the public’s consciousness – making some people angry in the process. Last month, nine activists were sent to prison, where one of them, a scientist called Emma Smart, went on hunger strike for 26 days. Marches and rallies have been linked to protest since the middle ages. The Extinction Rebellion (XR) network, of which Insulate Britain is an offshoot, revived the tradition of getting arrested on purpose, a tactic employed by suffragettes. The idea is that by peacefully inundating the forces of law and order while attracting strong public support for a just cause, pressure can be put on the state to force change.  Two and a half years ago, the first wave of occupations of London landmarks by XR resulted in parliament voting to declare a climate emergency – meeting one of the rebels’ key demands. This coincided with a groundswell of support for the school strike movement, launched the previous year by Greta Thunberg in Stockholm. Creative examples of civil disobedience and non-violent confrontation leave a lasting impression. Recalling his career in the city in the 1990s, a period of intense anti-road-building activism, Alok Sharma, president of Cop26, told delegates at the summit’s finance day that they should consider themselves “the new Swampys”. But if the tunnels and tree houses of 30 years ago are remembered fondly, attitudes to the same style of activism today are more conflicted. The month before Mr Sharma’s speech, Swampy (otherwise known as Daniel Hooper) was one of six activists acquitted by a judge of charges of aggravated trespass after they occupied a tunnel at Euston in an attempt to obstruct the HS2 rail project. The extent to which environmental activism becomes more difficult in 2022 will depend in part on the law, the courts and public opinion. Labour has yet to announce whether it will vote against a raft of anti-protest amendments added to the government’s police bill in the House of Lords. This repressive piece of legislation is the strongest anti-activist statement yet from a government whose leader once said that he would lie down in front of the bulldozers himself to stop a third runway at Heathrow airport being built. It is for the judges to determine what the law is. In June, the supreme court quashed the conviction of four anti-arms trade activists, in a ruling with wider ramifications that said some “disruption of ordinary life” is acceptable if caused by people exercising their right to free expression. The public mood creates the context in which all sorts of decisions (by politicians, prosecutors, businesses) are made. Evidence shows that the British public is increasingly alarmed about the climate: in October, Ipsos Mori found that 80% believe it is a global emergency caused by humans. But activists are divided about how best to harness such attitudes in order to drive the kinds of emissions reductions that are so desperately needed. There have always been differences in an environmental movement that spans a huge range of interests and priorities. Previously, the most obvious dividing line was between those engaged in the kinds of civil disobedience pioneered by Greenpeace (whose first action took place 50 years ago) and those focused solely on constitutionalist methods. But as agitations have become more aggressive, divisions in the green movement have become sharper. XR deserves credit for having boosted the climate crisis to the top of the political agenda – before the pandemic interrupted. But the theory of change it adopted, that if 3.5% of a population becomes engaged in non-violent direct action then a campaign will succeed, has been criticised as simplistic. An angry, physical confrontation with rush-hour passengers in east London is widely seen as a serious mistake, and suggestive of a worrying blindness to the social injustice and inequality that are an essential dimension of progressive climate politics, domestically and internationally. Similarly, Insulate Britain has faced criticism from those who think that the tactic of deliberately creating traffic jams is counterproductive – potentially making it easier for the government to pass laws restricting the right to protest. Another argument concerns who or what should be the target of protests. Given the failure of governments to rise to the challenge, both individually and collectively via the UN, some activists now believe that their efforts should be focused elsewhere. The US environmental writer and activist Bill McKibben thinks campaigners should ramp up pressure on the banks that finance fossil fuels. The question of how much emphasis to put on behaviour change in the rich western countries with the highest per capita emissions also remains contentious. The British philosopher Rupert Read, who has acted as a spokesperson for XR, argues that greater efforts within communities are a constructive way to make emissions reductions happen. Politics in the traditional sense remains vital, particularly in countries where 2022 will see important elections. Brazil’s citizens would do the world a favour by rejecting its climate-denying president. Non-violent civil disobedience erases the line between compliance and resistance to the state. In countries that abide by democratic principles, it remains a feasible tactic to challenge policies while accepting a system’s fundamentals. However, the existential nature of climate change leads to questions about the latter. Louise Lancaster, a former teacher and Insulate Britain protester, told the Guardian in November that she would be “willing to die” for the cause if she thought that it might save her three children from climate-related deaths. In his provocatively titled book How To Blow Up a Pipeline, the Swedish activist Andreas Malm makes a case for sabotaging fossil fuel infrastructure. Yet eco-sabotage could harden rather than soften climate-sceptic attitudes, making it easier for states to respond harshly. Non-violence does not seek to undermine the rule of law, only the repeal of unjust laws. Ultimately, it’s difficult to see how a just transition to net zero could be achieved by unjust means.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on climate activism: between obedience and resistance | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/29/the-guardian-view-on-climate-activism-between-obedience-and-resistance
12/30/2021,"The landless many have always had to struggle for access to land owned by the few in order to engage in their radical recreational walking and climbing. The Kinder Scout mass trespass of 1932, referred to by John Harris (Walking is a glorious, primal pastime – and far more radical than you think, 26 December), was organised by the communist-led British Workers’ Sports Federation (BWSF) as an extension of the class struggle at the time of the hunger marches and Gandhi’s Salt March. The established ramblers and other outdoor groups fiercely condemned the BWSF’s direct-action strategy of seizing the commanding heights of the open moorlands of the Peak District; they favoured a more reformist agenda of seeking upland access through parliamentary legislation.  In 1949, the Labour party quietly shelved its 1945 manifesto commitment to land nationalisation, and the mandatory access provisions of the new national parks were minimal. The 2000 Countryside and Rights of Way Act was similarly limited, and the current Land Justice movement is still having to campaign and trespass for a real general right to roam, in the face of growing threats to criminalise the act of walking on land that one doesn’t own (Highland landowner faces legal challenge over right to roam, 26 December).Julian BatsleerManchester  Like John Harris, I was introduced to walking by my late father – a foundry man who was neither bourgeois nor radical, and generally walked alone. I carried on walking alone, with my wife, then with our children, and subsequently with friends, viewing groups of walkers in open countryside as a bit too organised and maybe even undesirable. However, in the 10 years I’ve been an active member of the Ramblers I have learned new skills, been introduced to new walking routes, made many friends and discovered the pleasure of walking with and learning from people I might never meet socially in “normal clothing”, discussing everything from the natural world to social history, politics, poetry and pandemics. This year, our group produced a book of local walks contributed by a dozen members with the aim of connecting with people who do not see themselves as walkers, but had begun to explore the area during lockdowns. The initial print run of 1,000 copies is almost exhausted within nine months. We have sold through sub-post offices, community-owned businesses, and Exeter’s cathedral and museum, enabling us to reach a larger slice of the community; feedback suggests a high level of interest in volume two.Les BrightExeter, Devon  It was a great pleasure to read John Harris’s article. As well as the barriers he identifies – “prejudice, traffic, locked gates, signs with the dread words ‘private – keep out’” – he could have added the lack of public transport, particularly in rural and county council authorities. Having recently completed the Calderdale Way and the Leeds Country Way without any problems using buses and trains, access by public transport to North Yorkshire and the Dales national park is far more restricted, and at times nonexistent. Given the urgency of protecting the environment and the welcome popularity in rambling, far more should be done to get people out of cars through a coordinated walking and public transport strategy.Mike SteinPudsey, West Yorkshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
