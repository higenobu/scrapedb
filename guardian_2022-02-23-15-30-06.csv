2/23/2022,"US rock band Foo Fighters will perform a one-off Victorian concert in Geelong next Friday, becoming the first major international music act to travel to Australia since the pandemic began. The band’s Geelong show – the first major music event at GMHBA Stadium – will coincide with the launch of a new 7,500-capacity pop-up gig venue at Reunion Park as the Victorian government attempts to revitalise the battered music scene.  But local venues and promoters have said more is needed at a grassroots level, including giving certainty about how future potential Covid lockdowns could work, in order for the industry to recover. Foo Fighters, who have won 12 Grammys and are premiering their horror comedy film Studio 666 this week – will be supported by local acts Amyl and the Sniffers, and The Meanies. The performance will announce the arrival of a new statewide music event – Always Live – to be held across Victoria in the second half of the year. The state’s tourism minister, Martin Pakula, on Wednesday said about 25,000 music fans would attend the Geelong gig on 4 March. “Foo Fighters, in terms of the quality of that act, should give you a really good sense of what we’re trying to achieve here,” he told reporters. Always Live – spearheaded by the late music industry executive Michael Gudinski – aims to fund and celebrate contemporary live music from Australia and abroad. The full program for the event will be released in the middle of the year. Always Live chair and Michael Gudinski’s son, Matt Gudinski, said the event had been a “passion project” for his late father to ensure Victoria remained the “music capital of Australia”. “I know Dad would be very proud to see the event launched and form a major part of re-establishing a thriving live music scene,” he said. In New South Wales, a similar state government-driven live music series called Great Southern Nights kicks off next month, featuring a lineup of local acts such as Jimmy Barnes and Kate Ceberano. Paris Martine, a tour promoter who also books gigs for the Curtin Hotel, said the Foo Fighters’ gig was welcomed, but the Victorian government needed to shift its focus from major events to smaller band room venues. “It’s wonderful that sector gets to come back, but those types of gigs are not the engine room where bands are built. They’re not the engine rooms where bands cut their teeth and perform their first album show,” she said. “There needs to be a focus on smaller band rooms and what needs to happen to see them through.” Last week, the Curtin – a cornerstone of Melbourne’s music scene – became the latest live music venue to announce it would close its doors for the final time in November, with the owners of the almost 150-year-old building deciding to sell the space. Martine said while the sector was excited about the recent removal of restrictions on live music events, it was time to start planning for what would be needed if Covid restrictions were to return. “This is not the government’s first rodeo any more, so nobody can turn around and say, ‘We didn’t expect this to happen’. What we need is some certainty so that we know what does happen if there is a new strain,” she said. “There needs to be a tick list where the government says, ‘these are the environments that solely rely on high-density to be viable’, to ensure support comes in immediately. And when we come out of it, [restrictions in] live music venues need to lift directly in line with other forms of activity. So, if dancing’s back, it’s back right across the board, not just at weddings. If density restrictions lift at major events, it lifts for small venues.” Simone Pulga, director of Melbourne venue The Butterfly Club, said Always Live would not be enough to counter the “two years of catastrophic systemic collapse” the music industry had suffered. “It’s very unlikely that this is the last we’ll hear of Covid challenges … whenever there is a need to lock down, the government feels as if it’s the first time and it’s March 2020 all over again,” he said. “It’s now fair for us to expect that the government will develop policies when we are not in emergency mode that will be used when an emergency comes up. Things like if liquor licences should be charged in full during Covid restrictions, and financial support of a kind that can be quickly given to artists and venues.” Tickets for the Foo Fighters’ Geelong performance go on sale from midday Friday and range from $99 to $220. Victoria’s Reunion park, which will be located in the City of Yarra’s Burnley Circus Site in Melbourne’s inner east, will host one-off music performances, festivals and art shows. The 7,500-capacity space consist of two tents and will run from 4 March to 10 April.",Arts/Music,Foo Fighters to headline Victoria’s live music revival but concerns remain for smaller venues,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/23/foo-fighters-to-headline-victorias-live-music-revival-but-concerns-remain-for-smaller-venues

2/23/2022,"There are six varieties of pipefish living in British waters, the most noticeable of them being the largest, the greater pipefish, Syngnathus acus. For the amateur, the types are fairly difficult to distinguish from one another, with all species being long, thin and bony, and the juveniles of one species looking like the adults of another. They resemble stretched-out seahorses, to which they are related. They are of no commercial value and therefore little studied and largely ignored but they occur all round Britain and Ireland. They are poor swimmers and after storms hundreds can be washed up and stranded at high tide. Adults can reach 45cm (18in) but are generally 35cm long.  Like seahorses, the males carry and care for their young after mating but have been known to consume their unborn offspring in order to build up strength when another more attractive female comes along. They have a small mouth at the end of a long snout that allows them to feed by sucking in tiny shrimps like a vacuum cleaner. Their favoured home is among seagrass beds close to shore, a habitat badly degraded and threatened by seabed trawling. Seagrass provides perfect camouflage for their scaly and stripy bodies. Elsewhere, they are more vulnerable to being eaten by larger fish and seabirds.",News/Environment,Specieswatch: Britain’s seagrass-loving pipefish,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/23/specieswatch-britains-seagrass-loving-pipefish
2/23/2022,"The NHS does not have the 6,000 staff needed to run its promised array of new testing centres designed to speed up diagnosis of cancer and other diseases, medical leaders are warning. The drive to recruit the radiographers and radiologists needed to take and analyse scans and X-rays at the community diagnostic centres (CDCs) in England risks already-understaffed hospitals losing key staff to work there, a “robbing Peter to pay Paul” strategy that would backfire, they claim.  The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has confirmed in a written parliamentary answer that the centres will need an extra 3,500 radiographers to carry out diagnostics tests and 2,000 radiologists to interpret the results, as well as 500 advanced practitioners, who are senior nurses. NHS England has promised to spend £2.3bn setting up at least 100 CDCs by early 2025, and ultimately more than 160 of them, as part of a major effort to identify life-threatening diseases such as cancer and diabetes sooner and tackle the NHS’s huge backlog of non-urgent hospital care. They are central to its “elective recovery plan” to address the 6.1m-strong treatment backlog. It has pledged that the centres “will significantly increase the diagnostic capacity available for suspected cancer and support faster diagnosis and reduced waiting times”. It plans to site many of the new centres on high streets and has promoted them as user-friendly places where “combining a diagnostic test with a shopping trip will be far more common in the future”. The centres will help deliver it 9m more tests and checks a year by 2025, it said. But groups representing the staff needed insist that the extra 6,000 specialists do not exist. “There is a real concern that CDCs will be staffed with radiographers and other staff that are only available because they have left jobs elsewhere in the NHS,” said Richard Evans, the chief executive of the Society and College of Radiographers. “Robbing Peter to pay Paul is never a good strategy and it could be disastrous for NHS diagnostics as a whole.” While “delivering diagnostics quickly and more conveniently for the public is an admirable plan”, the UK will need to train more homegrown radiographers and also recruit more from overseas if the NHS is to fulfil its ambition, Evans added. The Royal College of Radiologists warned that patients who are due to have a diagnostic test at a hospital where staff have left to work in the CDCs could face a longer wait for it, a delay to the start of their treatment and potentially a poorer outcome as a result. “Over 80% of patients treated in a hospital have images such as an X-ray, CT or MRI interpreted by a radiologist, often at the beginning of their diagnosis and treatment. “Any delay in taking or interpreting these images risks creating a choke point for other areas of the NHS, impacting our ability to deliver effective treatment for most illnesses,” said Dr Jeanette Dickson, the college’s president. The NHS is already short of 1,939 consultant radiologists, she added. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said patients were paying the price for the government’s failure to address longstanding NHS staff shortages. “The super massive black hole in the government’s NHS recovery plan was the lack of a workforce strategy. NHS staff have gone above and beyond in the past two years, but there aren’t enough of them. Patients will continue waiting longer for care until the staff shortages are fixed. “After a decade of Tory mismanagement, the NHS went into the pandemic with 100,000 vacancies. It’s not just that the Conservatives didn’t fix the roof when the sun was shining, they dismantled the roof and removed the floorboard,” he said. A spokesperson for the DHSC said: “Our record investment in the NHS includes an extra £2bn this year and £8bn over the next three years to tackle the backlog caused by the pandemic. “There are record numbers of staff working in the NHS in England and we are focused on securing even more staff, as well as making patient care as effective and efficient as possible, so we can continue to ensure the NHS is always there for those who need it.”",News/Society,"NHS lacks 6,000 staff needed to run testing centres in England",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/23/nhs-lacks-6000-staff-needed-to-run-testing-centres-in-england
2/23/2022,"Imagine that a hostile power managed to infiltrate the UK’s government. Imagine that it set out to demoralise and debilitate this country, destroying our sense of common purpose, undermining our stability and trashing the lives of many of our citizens. Imagine that it had to operate below the radar, within the structures of a nominally democratic system. Let’s follow this thought experiment for a moment. What would such a hostile force set out to do?  It would seek, first of all, to destroy trust. The people it planted in the government would lie prolifically, then lie about the lies, until we were so disoriented we no longer knew what to believe. They would damage our sense of national cohesion with a blatant disregard for the rules the rest of us must follow. They would seek to ensure that we lost faith in the political system and ceased to believe that those who govern us have our best interests at heart. The hostile power would also set out to destroy, through subtle and insidious cuts, our social infrastructure: the effective delivery of health, education, social, environmental and local services. It would allow our physical infrastructure – public transport, sewerage, public buildings and other essential services – to deteriorate until, in some cases, it came close to collapse. It would attack and undermine crucial symbols of national pride, such as the NHS, the BBC, the National Trust and the universities. It would further harm our sense of nationhood by trashing much of what we treasure and love, such as clean rivers, the green belt and well-planned cities. It would sow division by promoting inequality, enabling a prosperous elite to accumulate ever more of the country’s wealth. After all, as George Orwell remarked during the second world war, “the lady in the Rolls-Royce car is more damaging to morale than a fleet of Goering’s bombing planes”. It would impede trading relations with our neighbours and major economic partners, in the hope of cutting us off from the world. It would undermine peace agreements and impose internal borders. It would allow crime to run rampant, permitting an explosion of devastating fraud and financial crimes such as money laundering that further harm our international standing and the concept of equality before the law. Far from stamping out profiteering during a national crisis, the hostile power would create a special channel, enabling favoured interests to guzzle public money. It’s hard to think of a better policy for destroying trust in public life and the sense that we are all in this together. You can see where this is going. It sometimes seems to me that if this government had set out to harm our country, it could scarcely have done a better job. It seems perversely committed to the destruction of civic life, national pride and a sense of belonging. You can more or less predict Tory policy on any issue by asking yourself: “What’s the most toxic and harmful strategy they could hope to get away with?” So what is going on? Has a hostile power managed to infiltrate the UK government? In a way, yes. That power is oligarchic capital. At the weekend, the Sunday Times reported that people who have donated at least £250,000 to the Conservative party have been invited to join an “advisory board”, with special access to the prime minister, cabinet ministers and senior government advisers. They have used this access to lobby for changes in government policy. The 14 identified members of the group have a combined wealth of at least £30bn, and have donated £22m to the Conservatives. Among them are property tycoons, financiers, two people with connections to the Kremlin, a tobacco magnate and an internet entrepreneur currently facing trial for rape and sexual assault (both of which he denies). The group and its agenda had hitherto been kept secret. The Sunday Times reporting was based on a trove of leaked documents. The advisory group appears to cross the line that separates party business from government business, especially as the official facilitating it is on the public payroll. We have also been told that the Conservative party is helping its donors to apply for key government positions, which looks like another obvious transgression of the line. Another tranche of leaked documents suggest that offering a golden ladder to prestigious public appointments is used as leverage when persuading them to part with their money. Political funding has long been a means by which the very rich can exercise inordinate influence over public policy. But this influence now seems to have become cruder and more extreme than at any time in living memory. Far from seeking to contain plutocratic power, Boris Johnson hopes to strip the Electoral Commission of its powers to stop abuses of the funding system. Big donors are not the only oligarchs with inordinate influence over this government. Dominic Cummings claimed that Boris Johnson referred to the Telegraph, owned by the billionaire Frederick Barclay, as “my real boss”. Rupert Murdoch and his senior executives have held several private meetings with Johnson and members of his cabinet. Are the very rich deliberately trying to harm our country? In some cases, perhaps. There is a strand of capitalism that wants to generate crises, then seize national assets at fire sale prices. But no such intention is required to explain the general damage inflicted by oligarchic capital. It is simply that the interests of the very rich are not the same as the interests of the nation. We should never forget what the billionaire stockbroker Peter Hargreaves, who donated £3.2m to one of the leave campaigns, said about Brexit: “We will get out there and we will become incredibly successful because we will be insecure again. And insecurity is fantastic.” No responsible government would allow the demands of the ultra-rich to override the needs of the nation. But we have no responsible government.

2/23/2022,"High on a pedestal above the fashion week crowd, a model fluttered her white feather fan in time to the strains of a jazz quartet, the starburst beading on her inky blue silk dress twinkling under the chandeliers. Another sipped a negroni as she grooved daintily in a molten gold strapless gown. A pistachio silk dress was accessorised with a beaded skull cap; handpainted velvet was edged with a neckline of black feathers; tiny evening bags swung on delicate gold chains. As the grand marbled hall, where Rixo’s London fashion week collection was being showcased, filled up with editors, buyers and influencers, the audience shrugged off their Storm Eunice trenchcoats and gazed, saucer-eyed, at the Gatsby-esque pyramids of champagne coupes, which stood tall as Christmas trees in each corner of the room.The pop of champagne corks reverberated through this London fashion week. It was an oddly soothing sound, like an all-clear signal after an air raid, to nerves jangled by two years on high alert. The shows have returned to familiar cheek-by-jowl near-chaos, after stilted seasons of masked models and socially distanced audiences. And the new look that is everywhere is not a colour or a must-have hemline or even a hot take on the tracksuit. It is the party dress.  At Halpern’s show in Brixton, slip dresses in flamingo-pink satin and tiger-striped velvet dripped from the models’ bodies like butter off hot toast. “I wanted it to be like, Anjelica Huston wakes up at a Scarface-era party after two years in a fever dream,” the designer Michael Halpern explained backstage. Everywhere you went, there was dressing up, and there was dancing. Preen held its first show in two years in Heaven nightclub, under the railway arches at Charing Cross. Ballet students with messily knotted hair and thick scrawls of eyeliner wore ra-ra dresses of white feathers that spun around their hips like punk tutus while they danced. Every so often, a particularly high-energy leap would dislodge remnants of a glitter shower, from some long-forgotten Saturday night, from the rafters, to land in the lap of the audience packed last-dance tight on the wooden benches around the room. Clements Ribeiro, the beloved 1990s London label relaunched by the designer Inacio Ribeiro and his wife, Suzanne Clements, last year, turned their teatime presentation into a Brazilian party, with professional forró dancers pairing up to show off their hip swings, and pulling punters on to the dancefloor to teach them some moves. Erdem Moralıoğlu added beaded opera gloves to slippery bias-cut dresses and sent the models into hushed darkness dotted with pools of milky light. He liked to imagine they were walking home from a club in the dead of night under streetlamps. “I love the swoosh of a sequin,” the designer said. “It’s always been one of my favourite sounds.”The vibe shift towards dressing to go out – or to go out-out – is a radical change of pace. Until recently, two years of eerie tidelessness had left fashion beached. With nowhere to go, we gave up on dressing up. But, as the world allows itself to glimpse a light at the end of the tunnel, our appetite for getting back into the swing of things is returning. Fashion weeks are, undeniably, slightly ridiculous, but they are also part of life’s rhythm, along with muddy music festivals and glossy red-carpet film award ceremonies, office sweepstakes for horse races and water-cooler chats about Love Island. It’s deeply reassuring to see London fashion week getting the wind back in its sails. That fashion should be all about the party dress right now is both the zeitgeist and a business opportunity. The rise of hybrid working has left many of us with a full-time office wardrobe and a part-time office schedule, so we have more smart work clothes than we need. And pretty much nobody is opening their wardrobe at this moment and thinking, what would truly thrill me to the bones would be a new tracksuit. It may have become fashionable to write fashion off, but after all that tablescaping and curating of Zoom backdrops, many of us have come to the conclusion that expressing personal style entirely through expensive twirly pastel candles and high-maintenance succulents is, in the end, a little airless. The buzziest labels in London right now are making dresses for the dancefloor – or, at least, for a Netflix-and-chill vibe rather than just Netflix. Poster Girl is designed by Francesca Capper and Natasha Somerville, who met at Central Saint Martins and, between them, have worked in the Dior, Vivienne Westwood and Jeremy Scott design studios. The brand creates slip-of-a-thing candy-coloured dresses with heart-shaped cut-outs and micro-mini hems, and is already beloved of Dua Lipa and Kylie Jenner. Nensi Dojaka, the winner of the prestigious LVMH prize, trained in lingerie design, and it shows in her bra-styled dresses, corsets and stretchy knits. Supriya Lele’s halterneck necklines and hipbone-baring low-slung minis are riding high on fashion’s current Y2K revival, and brought a powerhouse front row that included Victoria Beckham to her show. The shift towards showing skin was striking at Simone Rocha, where flounced and opulent party dresses were, this season, shrunk to I Tonya-esque proportions. This is happening on the shop floor, too, in real time: Zara is full of distinctly un-February-ish mini wrap frocks in Pucci-adjacent swirls, and the midi dresses at & Other Stories have risque cut-outs and curving ruched seams. The rise of upcycling, making new clothes out of fabric remnants and pre-worn clothing, is also driving a focus on partywear. Young designer Conner Ives’s knotted-and-twisted frocks, sewn from vintage T-shirts, are proof that you can make something fun and flamboyant from discarded clothes. It is probably more difficult to make, say, a trouser suit or a tailored coat from odds and ends. Recycled Lurex fringing regenerates old fabric into new, the shredded texture adding to the general dazzle. And upcycled partywear feels like a celebration of old clothes, which fits with the values of a new generation of designers, who believe sustainability should look and feel aspirational rather than second best.The party atmosphere can’t hide the fact that British fashion is having a tough time, squeezed in a pincer movement between the pandemic and Brexit. The biggest European luxury houses have experienced a remarkable bounce back from Covid. Kering, which owns Gucci, Saint Laurent and Balenciaga, saw a rise in net profit of 37% last year to $3.64bn; LVMH, home of Dior, Fendi and Celine, doubled its net profit to $12bn. Meanwhile, exports of clothing and footwear from the UK were last year down by almost 60% on 2018. That the job is more perilous than ever, combined with designers presenting their clothes at live shows, in many cases for the first time in years, fuels a sense of fashion week drama. “It was getting quite claustrophobic, doing everything in the studio,” noted the designer Molly Goddard, who built a 5ft-high catwalk for her first show since lockdowns began, and dressed models in fishtail taffeta dresses and tulle puffballs. “A show is quite cathartic, and inevitably it gives you a more extreme perspective.” A return to a normal that we can barely remember brings with it its own sense of unreality. “I’ve kind of been waiting to put on a catwalk show my whole life,” Ives said to me at his studio last week. As part of the Central Saint Martins class of 2020, he saw the graduation show that his studies, and childhood dreams, had been building up to cancelled at the last moment. “And now, after everything we’ve all been through … what, are we all going straight back to Milan and Paris and flying around the world? I mean, I believe in catwalk shows, but I also don’t feel the world can just forget the last two years,” he said, shaking his head in bewilderment, even as models filed through the studio door for final fittings. “I don’t feel like we can take anything for granted any more.” Many of us can relate to that. And to some, it sounds like a reason to wear a party dress when you can.",Lifestyle/Fashion,"‘I love the swoosh of a sequin’: the party dress is back, back, BACK!

2/23/2022,"Britain’s youth has lost its social swagger, with happiness and confidence among 16- to 25-year-olds plunging to a 13-year low, according to research exposing the impact of Covid. With music festivals cancelled, nightclubs shuttered and students confined to halls of residence, 40% of young people now report being anxious about socialising with people, one-third say they don’t know how to make new friends and 35% say they’ve never felt more alone, a study by the Prince’s Trust has revealed.  Even as the last lockdown restrictions are lifted this week, youth workers say they face an uphill struggle persuading people to socialise in real life, rather than online. Young people are reporting friendship groups withering and acute anxiety about going out, a legacy of having to negotiate infection control measures and fear of spreading Covid. The impact is worse for those not in work, education or training and from poorer backgrounds, with a quarter of young people in those groups reporting that they always feel anxious compared with 15% among people working or studying. “Young people aren’t getting the same level of new experiences and that’s stopping them becoming independent,” said Claire Carroll, who works with young people in Birmingham for the Prince’s Trust. “There’s not the same level of socialisation you get if you go to college or have a job. I think a lot of people have fallen through the gaps.” The Prince’s Trust NatWest Youth Index, based on polling this month by YouGov, found almost a quarter of young people believed they would never recover from the emotional impact of the pandemic and almost half agreed that the pandemic had left them feeling “burnt out”. A separate Office for National Statistics survey this month showed 16- to 29-year-olds feel considerably more anxious than the general population. 42% reported high levels of anxiety in the first half of this month compared with 34% on average and just 29% for people aged 50 to 69. The youngest are also the only group among whom the majority said they felt lonely often, always or some of the time. “There seems to be a real thirst for people to be together,” said a youth worker in London who said he saw high levels of social anxiety. “There are great hugs and shrieks when they get together, but then everyone goes on their phone.” Some girls have been spending up to 19 hours a day on their screens and others have decided against developing romantic relationships, even dressing in body-covering tracksuits with the purpose of avoiding attention. They don’t want to face criticism on social media if an issue blows up, he said. “Being a teenager you already have to navigate a lot of difficulties. You are exploring your identity and your place in the world. Add the pandemic that has separated you from your peer group, the schools stripping out support services, 12 years of austerity and the explosion of social media and you have a perfect storm.” Molly Trenwith, 23, from Wigan, was among thousands of young people bereaved during the pandemic. She said her anxiety grew after her mother, Jane, 60, died, to the extent she was “terrified to leave the house and scared of getting Covid”. It meant that between the ages of 21 and 23, when young people’s social lives are often blooming, physical contact with her friends and family was replaced with Facebook messenger and WhatsApp. “I would just sit in bed,” she said. “It was easier for me dealing with my mental health, but in reality, it made it worse.” “When you leave college you’re supposed to go out, drink and meet people, but all of that went online,” she said. “I don’t know how to start a conversation. It is strange how it has changed.” Mahoua Koui, 22, from Stoke, said she had found sustaining friendships during the past two years difficult, and said her social dynamic had changed from a large friendship ground to her now just having two close friends. “This alarming downward spiral of anxiety, stress and lack of confidence for the future will impact young people today and in future generations, while widening the gap for the most disadvantaged,” said Jonathan Townsend, the UK chief executive of Prince’s Trust. “With the right support from businesses, government and charities we can turn this around and ensure young people have the right skills and confidence to feel positive about their future work, and about their life overall.”",News/Society,"Happiness among UK young people has hit 13-year low, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/23/happiness-among-uk-young-people-has-hit-13-year-low-study-finds
2/23/2022,"Wildfires that have devastated California, Australia and Siberia will become 50% more common by the end of the century, according to a new report that warns of uncontrollable blazes ravaging previously unaffected parts of the planet. The escalating climate crisis and land-use change are driving a global increase in extreme wildfires, with a 14% increase predicted by 2030 and a 30% increase by 2050, according to a UN report involving more than 50 international researchers.  The findings suggest there should be a radical change in public spending on wildfires. The report said governments were putting their money in the wrong place by focusing on the work of emergency services when preventing fires would be a more effective approach. Wildfires are becoming an expected part of life on every continent, except Antarctica, destroying the environment, wildlife, human health and infrastructure, according to the report, which was written in collaboration with GRID-Arendal, a non-profit environmental communications centre. The report warned of a “dramatic shift in fire regimes worldwide”. “From Australia to Canada, the United States to China, across Europe and the Amazon, wildfires are wreaking havoc on the environment, wildlife, human health and infrastructure,” the foreword of the report said, adding that while the situation “is certainly extreme, it is not yet hopeless”. Although “landscape fires” are essential for some ecosystems to function properly, the report looks specifically at “wildfires”, which it defines as unusual free-burning vegetation fires that pose a risk society, the economy or environment. This month, researchers found global heating could cause “megafires resistant to fire-suppression practices” in southern California. In the US, nearly 3m hectares (7.7m acres) of land were burned by wildfires last year, with blazes becoming increasingly hard to fight. Direct responses to wildfires receive more than 50% of funding now, while planning and prevention get less than 1%. The paper calls for a “fire-ready formula” with investments rebalanced so half goes on planning, preventing and preparedness, about a third on response and 20% for recovery. Prof Sally Archibald, an ecologist at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, who was involved in the report, said: “This is a really important conclusion that I hope diverts money and resources in the right direction, as well as changing policies. “We cannot promise that if the world gives money for proactive fire management, there will be no more extreme fire events because these fires are caused by global climate change,” she said. “But it would certainly help us minimise the impact and minimise the loss of damage.” There are many natural solutions, including starting controlled fires using prescribed burning, managing landscapes by grazing animals to reduce the amount of flammable material in the landscape, as well as removing trees too close to people’s homes. There should be more science-based monitoring systems combined with indigenous knowledge and better international cooperation, the paper’s authors said, ahead of the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi. “After a century of research we’ve come around to agreeing that how people burn their landscapes traditionally in Africa is probably the most appropriate for the ecosystem,” said Archibald. Fire-management strategies vary globally, but as a very general rule, experts believe that ecosystems closer to the equator should have more controlled fires, and those farther away should have fewer. Exceptions include tropical forests such as the Amazon, which straddle the equator yet should have very few fires. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all situation. Fire is like rainfall – you get different types of fire in different parts of the world,” said Archibald. Wildfires have exacerbated the climate crisis by destroying carbon-rich ecosystems such as peatlands, permafrost and forests, making the landscape more flammable. Restoring ecosystems such as wetlands and peatlands helps prevent fires from happening and creates buffers in the landscape. Climate change increases the conditions in which wildfires start, including more drought, higher air temperatures and strong winds. Equally, carbon emissions from wildfires are at an all-time high. Tackling the climate crisis is a key priority in wildfire prevention, the report said. It also called for better health and safety standards for firefighters, including raising awareness of the dangers of smoke inhalation, reducing their exposure to life-threatening situations, and encouraging proper recovery between shifts. Inger Andersen, director of the UN Environment Programme, said: “We have to minimise the risk of extreme wildfires by being better prepared: invest more in fire-risk reduction, work with local communities and strengthen global commitment to fight climate change.” Prof Guillermo Rein, at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the paper, said it was good to read an “extensive and international overview” of how fire management needed to change. “The full report is impressive. It says so many good and important things,” he said. “Especially important is the emphasis on extreme wildfires and the recommendation for [a] move from reaction to prevention and preparedness.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,"Wildfires likely to increase by a third by 2050, warns UN",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/23/climate-crisis-driving-increase-in-wildfires-across-globe-says-report-aoe
2/23/2022,"The UK is exporting its pesticide footprint to other countries, environmentalists say. A new report, from the Pesticide Action Network UK, has found that increasing trade with Brazil could fund the use of harmful pesticides that are banned in Britain. The Brazilian government is currently pushing through a bill that would slash laws to protect human and environmental health from pesticides. Even without this new package of laws, Brazilian farmers are allowed to use almost double the number of hazardous pesticides as those in the UK, including the lethal herbicide Paraquat, which has caused tens of thousands of deaths across the world from acute poisoning, and neonicotinoids, which are toxic to bees.  Campaigners have said a reliance on increasing trade with Brazil after Brexit could incentivise the use of these pesticides and degrade the environment in that country. Vicki Hird, sustainable farming campaign coordinator at Sustain, said: “Most UK consumers have no idea that some of the meat they’re eating has been fed on soya grown using highly toxic chemicals. Right now, the UK government is talking a good game on reducing pesticide harms in the UK, but appears to have no problem with exporting our environmental and human health footprints to Brazil.” The report also warns that the stronger trade bond could end up weakening pesticide regulations in the UK. It says that as a major agricultural exporter, Brazil would have much to gain from a drop in UK standards, which exclude food exports containing pesticides in amounts that exceed UK safety limits. The UK government has proposed a bill that will sanction companies that have deforestation in their supply chains, including farmers in the Amazon who clear the rainforest. However, there is no such law for pesticides. Josie Cohen, head of policy and campaigns at Pesticide Action Network UK, said: “The UK trade secretary is promoting trade with Brazil as providing ‘real opportunities to go further on green trade’. Meanwhile, Brazil’s overuse of highly toxic pesticides is contributing to the destruction of the Amazon and other crucially important ecosystems, contaminating water and poisoning farmworkers and communities. And yet the government has provided no detail on how it will ensure that Brazilian food sold on UK shelves is not contributing to the global climate and nature crises.” Another report, released on Tuesday, found that in 2020 UK-based chemical companies notified the export of multiple hazardous pesticides banned from use on British farms and fields. The investigation by Unearthed, Greenpeace’s journalism wing, found that UK companies exported seven different banned agrochemicals overseas in that year. They included weedkillers containing Paraquat; insecticides containing Imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid banned in the UK because of the serious damage it can cause to bee populations; and a fungicide called Propiconazole, banned after it was found capable of harming babies in the womb. Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Doug Parr, said: “By allowing UK-based companies to export harmful chemicals banned for use on our farms, the UK government is behaving like a drug baron with the motto ‘don’t get high on your own supply’. These double standards are deeply cynical and morally indefensible. “Far from acting like an environmental leader, the UK government is failing to keep up with the European Commission, who have rightly committed to ending export of these banned chemicals. Ministers should consider the damage this toxic trade is doing to people and wildlife and should outlaw it immediately.” A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “This government is united in its commitment to upholding its world leading environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards in our trade deals. In the case of neonicotinoids and other chemicals, the UK goes above the international standard, requiring exporting companies to confirm with countries that they have accepted any imports before they are shipped. “We are committed to basing decisions on the use of pesticides on robust scientific assessment and will not authorise pesticides that may carry unacceptable risks to people or the environment. All agri-food products imported into the UK under existing or future trade agreements and partnerships will, as they do now, have to comply with our requirements.”",News/Environment,"UK trade could promote use of banned pesticides in Brazil, new report warns",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/23/uk-trade-could-promote-use-of-banned-pesticides-in-brazil-new-report-warns
2/23/2022,"A senior executive at Imperial College London is stepping down after the publication of damning details from a report on bullying by him and the Russell Group university’s president. Muir Sanderson, Imperial’s chief financial officer, is leaving after he and the president, Alice Gast, were found to have “created or contributed to a culture which involves and tolerates favouritism, exclusion, [and] the making of disparaging comments about others”.  The publication of parts of the report this month “caused renewed disquiet, frustration and anger across the college community”, staff and students were told in a message on Tuesday by Imperial’s chair, John Allan, who is also Tesco’s non-executive chairman. Gast – who, like Sanderson, has admitted and apologised for bullying – is staying on until August, despite calls to go sooner. Details from an independent report by Jane McNeill QC on allegations of bullying were published this month after attempts at suppression were rejected by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). Sanderson’s behaviour towards one victim was described as “aggressive and intimidating”. She was undermined and spoken to in a condescending and offensive way, for example being addressed as “young lady” and being told to “watch her tone”, the report said. “The evidence I heard also raises questions about whether MS’s character and powerful role within the college, encompassing the roles of both CFO and COO, impact on good decision-making in the college,” McNeill wrote. Another witness alleged that Sanderson had used the expression “[leaving] the plantation”. He has said he had no recollection of using the term. Sanderson was also alleged to have regarded a reference made by a former senior employee to a “one-armed black lesbian” as a joke. The report said it was “troubling in this day and age” that one of the most senior employees at an institution such as Imperial College should think this was a joke. The report found Gast had bullied a colleague but that her treatment of some others did not amount to bullying. Sanderson has apologised for bullying two colleagues. The report found he had bullied one person and said it made no finding that he had bullied another.",News/Education,Imperial College London finance chief steps down after bullying claims,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/23/imperial-college-london-muir-sanderson-resigns-bullying-claims
2/23/2022,"Acentury and more ago, many overfilled country churchyards had invisible “No vacancies” signs, diverting the dead from the expanding villages and nascent towns to the outlying fields, which then grew coffins instead of potatoes. Even so, exceptions were made for a privileged few, so that their remains could lie in the church graveyard itself. A local Tory grandee had four stakes in his future in St Swithin’s churchyard. When I visited the plot during his later years, I sometimes wondered if the old man ever came to see the rectangle of wooden nubs that marked out where he would spend his death. Now, 13 years after I heard the bells toll, it gives me a start to see how quickly the once off-white gravestone of a reputedly courteous and principled politician has weathered into grey and green.  A little further along the fence is the aptly named Graves family, residents of the mansion house next door. They found a place in heaven by moving the earth: after Walter Graves died in 1907, the family gave a sliver of their adjoining grounds to the church, and so the boundary shifted to “en-hallow” the Graves’ grave within consecrated ground. A salmon-coloured marble tomb of two facing scrolls occupies the donated land, where his wife, Fanny, and second son would join him. The engraver also chiselled out an inscription of personal tragedy in the absence of their firstborn, killed at Ypres. The epitaphs of some of the last burials of the Victorian period face the high street like advertising hoardings and, until recently, I would often nod a cheery greeting to the largest and most prominent stone, put up “In affectionate remembrance of Charles Carter who died December 31st 1863, aged 68”. A few weeks ago, I discovered that Carter – a market gardener and beer seller on the Great North Road – had hanged himself while in a state of what a jury called “temporary insanity”. A gravestone cannot describe the cruelty of laws that decreed there must be a night burial without a church service for this tortured soul.
