4/23/2022,"It was the hottest day of the year, the sun was shining with the temperature in the mid-20s, perfect for a get together – or so one of Boris Johnson’s top officials had obviously thought. In an email, sent to more than 100 employees, on 20 May 2020, Martin Reynolds, the prime minister’s principal private secretary, wrote: “Hi all, after what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No 10 garden this evening. Please join us from 6pm and bring your own booze!” There was just one problem – the country was in lockdown. The gathering, believed to have been attended by 30 or 40 people, occurred at a time when social mixing was banned except with one other person from another household outdoors in a public place. Staff quaffed wine and ate food laid out for them on tables. Among those present was the prime minister, who is believed to have attended with his then fiancee – now wife – Carrie Johnson. When details of the gathering first emerged, Johnson said he joined the event for about 25 minutes from 6pm to talk to and thank staff, believing that it was a work event, with the No 10 garden being used as “an extension of the office” amid lockdown. It was an explanation that attracted howls of derision in the House of Commons, given the invitation to “bring your own booze”. While the prime minister said he was not warned it was against the rules – and Reynolds was apparently equally ignorant, assuming it was not a wilful breach – some staff were more cautious. They feared they might be breaking the very laws the government had implemented. “Um. Why is Martin encouraging a mass gathering in the garden?” one staffer said, according to the BBC. Another asked: “Is this for real?” Johnson’s former aide Dominic Cummings, also claimed he raised a red flag at the time, saying he had told Reynolds that the invitation broke the rules. He said the prime minister’s principal private secretary replied: “So long as it’s socially distanced I think it’s OK, I’ll check with the PM if he’s happy for it to go ahead.” Just minutes before the party started, the daily press conference held inside Downing Street had concluded. The then culture secretary, now Conservative party co-chair, Oliver Dowden, had reinforced the messaging around what was permitted, saying: “You can meet one person outside your household in an outdoor, public place provided that you stay 2 metres apart.” Dowden announced the launch of the Covid alert level system, with each of its five levels relating to the level of threat posed by the virus, with the country at the time preparing to move to level 3 from 4. On that day, there were 9,953 people in hospital with coronavirus. A further 363 deaths were announced, bringing the total at that point to 35,704. Dowden was not the only one highlighting the rules. The Metropolitan police told people in a tweet on the afternoon of 20 May 2020 that they could have a picnic, exercise or do sport outside providing you are “on your own, with people you live with, or just you and one other person”.

But they could not have imagined that the transgressors they would be handing fixed-penalty notices out to more than two years later would include the prime minister.",Global,‘Bring your own booze!’: what happened at No 10 on 20 May 2020? ,https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/apr/22/bring-your-own-booze-what-happened-at-no-10-on-20-may-2020
4/23/2022,"“Big place, this,” Sir Alex Ferguson would say as he gazed around Old Trafford in the early days, a sense of awe in those gruff tones. Big job, too. When Ferguson took over from Ron Atkinson as the Manchester United manager in November 1986, the club were fourth from bottom of the old First Division and the culture was all wrong, especially in the playing squad, where there was too much boozing and not enough achieving. There will doubtless be a moment when the scale of it all hits Erik ten Hag, who was confirmed on Thursday as United’s next permanent manager; he will begin work over the summer, once he has finished the season at Ajax. Because not since Ferguson has an incoming manager found the club at such a low ebb. It is not about the league position. David Moyes inherited a champion team from Ferguson in 2013, albeit one that had surely peaked, but Louis van Gaal and José Mourinho took over with the club having finished the previous season in seventh and fifth respectively, and Ole Gunnar Solskjær – initially the caretaker – got them when they were sixth. United are sixth again under another interim, Ralf Rangnick, although the statistics show that they have their lowest points tally of the Premier League era after 33 matches. What sets the situation apart are the feelings of helplessness and frustration in the stands and dressing room, which are not helped by a glance at their greatest rivals. When Ferguson took over his biggest challenge was to knock Liverpool off their perch but they are now back on it and, even worse, Manchester City are up alongside them. The coming weeks will once again see the United fanbase wrestle with a dilemma. Of two unpalatable options, who would they rather win the league and, even, the Champions League? (It is probably still City in a photo-finish.) The fans have protested vociferously against the Glazer family ownership over the past week or so but what has been more worrying of late has been how some of them have turned on certain players at Old Trafford. Harry Maguire was cheered ironically when substituted against Atlético Madrid and Paul Pogba told where to go when he came off against Norwich. Even Marcus Rashford, the local hero and national treasure, has heard exasperated cries. This is extremely unusual at United, where – amid a dismal run of form and some abject performances – Rangnick has detected a fear factor. “We didn’t dare to attack,” he said after the 4-0 loss at Liverpool on Tuesday night, referring mainly to the first half. “It almost looked that they were afraid to be outplayed.” Rangnick is so concerned by the club’s injury list that he wants an investigation into why it has been so long but the very worst thing – the bottom line – is the lack of identity, the sense of square pegs in round holes, a jarring friction. Under Solskjær, United at least played in a particular way: a quick, counterattacking style that would yield some thrills, especially when allied to a never-say-die attitude, even if its lack of depth ultimately saw him exposed. It has been different under Rangnick. He wants intensity, hard running without the ball, to use the counterpress as a tool to attack and defend, and he has not found the players to execute it. The result has been an absence of control, creative toils and opponents running through United. Apart from David de Gea, has any player performed to or above his level? Maybe Fred. Cristiano Ronaldo’s numbers have been decent but do not tell the whole story. It has led to the view that this is the worst Old Trafford team since the late 1980s. Even De Gea’s excellence carries a caveat: United’s best player ought not to be their goalkeeper. Ten Hag represents the reboot, a very good coach who knows what he wants and how to implement it. It is pass-and-move football, with effective pressing – a little like the vision of Rangnick. Although wedded to a classic 4-3-3 at Ajax – it is in the constitution there – Ten Hag is flexible and, above all, he wants to win. The optimistic reading is that Ten Hag, who believes he can get so much more out of the squad, can take gradual and sure-footed steps forward, putting a playing structure in place, an identity, with signings aligned to his needs in the short and longer term. With United’s appeal and financial power, it should be possible to turn things back in the right direction – if decisions are sound and consistent. The rebuild in the summer stands to be huge, Rangnick – who will move into a consultancy role – saying during the week that “there will be … I don’t know … six, seven, eight, maybe 10 new players”. Pogba, Nemanja Matic, Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata and Edinson Cavani are expected or set to leave as free agents and Dean Henderson will surely prioritise greater playing time elsewhere. There have to be doubts over the futures of Phil Jones, Eric Bailly and Anthony Martial, who is on loan at Sevilla. The negative reading is that the body of work is simply too great, Liverpool and City too far ahead, and Ten Hag will fall foul of the equation which sets progress against time and pressure. Nor will it only be about the technical stuff because this is United, this is politics, international relations, box office. Is Ten Hag ready to be the de facto club spokesman on pretty much everything, the one voice heard with any regularity? It requires a force of personality to drive the juggernaut and a will to do so, which does not depend entirely on a fluency in English, even if that helps. The right kind of noises or content are key and, at Ajax Ten Hag has not always given the impression that he is comfortable in front of the media. The Dutch sometimes refer to him as wereldvreemd or world strange, someone so focused on football that he does not know anything else. Ten Hag will need the support of everybody at United, particularly the staff in the recruitment department, and one thing is clear: he has it all to prove. Big place, this. Big job.",Sport/Football,"Helplessness, frustration and fear: the picture of modern Manchester United | David Hytner",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/22/manchester-united-helplessness-frustration-fear-erik-ten-hag-worst-team-late-1980s
4/23/2022,"Chernihiv is the largest Ukrainian city to have been freed from Russian occupation. Its pre-war population was estimated at around 280,000. After being under siege for more than a month only a third of that figure remains. Seven hundred people have lost their lives, according to official sources. Before the Russian invasion on 24 February, the city was little known around the world. It is situated 150 kilometres northeast of Kyiv and just 60km away from the border with Belarus, on the banks of the Desna river. In Ukraine, Chernihiv was known for its wonderful churches, chic parks and great promenades by the river. The new reality for those left behind is tough. Coming out from their hideouts after more than three weeks without electricity or running water, they are met by huge craters and wrecked structures. There are mountains of steel, concrete, glass and plastic. Here and there, torn posters and paintings, as well as small pieces of metal adding to a truly dystopian scene. Everywhere there are buildings – including hospitals, schools, libraries and residential blocks – that have been destroyed. One of the places that lies in ruins is the local football ground. Sadly, it is a perfect illustration of the effects that the Russian invasion has had throughout Ukraine. Before the bombs destroyed it, it could hold 12,000 people – the local side, FC Desna, played in the Ukrainian Premier League there, as did the women’s national side. Now, it has been reduced to rubble. The stands are destroyed, the windows broken. What remains of the once proud stadium has been left with metre-long cracks. In addition, items including gym equipment, TVs and other accessories were stolen from the offices. On the pitch, meanwhile, there are craters as deep as four metres. “At least five rockets hit the stadium. It’s all destroyed,” says Oleksandr Lomako, Chernihiv’s regional governor. “This is civil infrastructure. The club had no military connections, there were no soldiers, no equipment, nothing. We used this complex for adults as well as children. From 24 February, Chernihiv was under constant shelling. “All the buildings that have been bombed are part of the civil infrastructure,” he adds. “What will the kids do now? Where will they train once the war is over?” “After the enemy blew up the bridge over the Desna river, Chernihiv became an island,” the Chernihiv deputy regional governor, Dmytro Ivanov, explains. “The Russians circled the city then started bombing our food supplies, our humanitarian aid, as well as the gas stations. There was no electricity; hundreds of people were dying. We could not even bury them.” As recently as the 2019-20 season Desna enjoyed their best-ever campagin, qualifying for Europe after finishing fourth in the league. They played German club Wolfsburg in the third preliminary round of the Europa League, losing 2-0 in a single-legged qualifier. Before the war started, Desna were seventh in the Ukrainian league. The stadium has a proud history – and a surprising former name – too. In 1961 Yuri Gagarin became the first human to travel into space. The then 27-year-old became a hero throughout the world, and the Russian communist authorities awarded him the Order of Lenin and the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Three years after earning global acclaim, Gagarin visited the stadium in Chernihiv to meet his fellow cosmonaut, Andriyan Nikolayev. The moment needed to be marked, so the stadium was named after Gagarin. Despite it now being renamed to the Olympic sports training centre, the locals still call it “The Gagarin”. All is not lost. Local and national authorities have promised the club that the stadium will be rebuilt. The Ukrainian culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, has held talks with his German counterparts, who assured him of their support. Borussia Dortmund have also promised to help out. “They have not forgotten Andriy Yarmolenko,” Tkachenko said, referring to the West Ham forward who grew up in Chernihiv and started his professional career with Desna, before moving on to Dynamo Kyiv and Dortmund. Help may be on the way but Desna supporters have already gathered to clear up at their stadium. At the weekend a symbolic amateur match was even organised at the Gagarin, on the side of the pitch where the bombs did not land. Football is injecting some life back into the stadium and the club’s faithful. The first team manager, Oleksandr Ryabokon, joined the Ukrainian defence forces at the beginning of April. “He’s clearing Kyiv of Russian creatures,” a Desna club spokesperson says. The Under-19 coach, Oleksandr Zub, is also part of the military operation, as are the club’s ex-owner, Ivan Chaus, and former player Dmytro Zaderetsky. Together with Mariupol and Kharkiv, Chernihiv is now a “hero city” following a decision by the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Ukrainian soldiers have promised the city’s residents the Russians will not return but, having witnessed the atrocities over the past two months, the people are afraid to believe them. “We don’t know when and how this war will end,” says a Desna supporter called Oleg. “We are normal people, but our normal lives have been taken away. We just don’t understand why someone would attack and kill innocent civilians. “I go to the stadium every day with a couple of friends. It’s the only place in the city where you can hope to hear the voices of some happy children. It is football, the memories it brought us, and the hope of a normal future, that keeps us going.”",Sport/Football,Football in Ukraine: ‘Where will the kids train now?’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/football-in-ukraine-where-will-the-kids-train-now
