5/20/2022,"A Russian tank commander who pleaded guilty earlier this week to shooting dead an unarmed Ukrainian civilian has said he will accept any punishment from the court, on the third day of the first war crimes trial resulting from Russia’s war in Ukraine. Vadim Shysimarin, 21, told courtroom No 201 of the Kyiv tribunal that he “was nervous about what was going on” on the day 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov died and that he “didn’t want to kill”. Standing in the glass defence box, wearing a grey and blue hoodie, his shaved head lowered, Shysimarin added: “I’m truly and sincerely sorry. I didn’t want that to happen, I didn’t want to be there, but it happened. I would like to apologise once again. And I will accept all the measures of punishment that I will be offered.” On Thursday, during the second hearing, Shysimarin asked Shelipov’s widow to forgive him for the murder of her husband. Prosecutors have asked the judge to sentence Shysimarin to life in prison. In closing arguments, Shysimarin’s lawyer, Viktor Ovsyannikov, said his client was not guilty of premeditated murder and war crimes, and asked the judges to acquit him. In an interview with the Guardian at the end of the hearing, Ovsyannikov said his client killed a civilian by order and therefore he did not consider it to be a breach of the rules of war. “There is an absence of intent here,” he said. “It was an execution of an order … he didn’t want to kill him, and this has certain legal meaning. “I would single out those bastards that shot at the back of civilians’ heads in Bucha during the occupation,” Ovsyannikov added. “It’s quite different from the circumstances my client was in.” According to the Ukrainian prosecutor Andriy Syniuk, the instruction to open fire cannot be considered a military order and therefore does not protect Shysimarin from responsibility. “The person who gave an ‘order’ wasn’t his commander. He was aware of that. The person who gave the instruction was aware of that. Before they got into the vehicle they didn’t know each other,” Syniuk said. Shysimarin comes from Ust Illyinsk in the south-east Irkutsk region of Russia and was a commander in the Kantemirovskaya tank division on the day of the killing. Earlier in the day he had been with a group of Russian soldiers who shot at a civilian vehicle after their convoy came under attack from Ukrainian forces. The Russian soldiers then stole the car and drove it away. They later came across the unarmed victim, who was talking on his phone a few dozen metres from his own home. One of the men in the car told Shysimarin “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. Shysimarin opened fire out of the car window. “He fired three to four shots from his automatic weapons,” Syniuk told the court. “Could he have stepped out of the car and expropriated the phone of the victim. Yes he could. Could he just make one shot? Yes he could. But instead, he killed a civilian citizen of Ukraine.” More than 1,000 bodies of civilians were found under the rubble or in mass graves when the Russians withdrew from the Kyiv region in early April, leaving in their path a huge crime scene that international and Ukrainian prosecutors have been working on. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, has said she is preparing more than 40 cases for war crimes trials, and authorities say they have registered more than 10,000 war crimes, including attacks on hospitals. Ukraine’s Interfax news agency reported on Thursday that two more Russian soldiers on trial in the centre of the country had admitted to accusations of firing artillery on civilians. Authorities in Ukraine are moving fast and trying to carry out justice while the conflict is ongoing. Oleh Tkalenko, a senior prosecutor in the Kyiv region, said they had identified more than 5,000 Russian soldiers who operated north of Kyiv. “It’s an ongoing process,” he said. “After they have been identified we are trying to understand which crimes they committed. We are keeping records of all prisoners of war, and we know which ones did and which ones didn’t commit war crimes. The prosecutor general’s office is in charge of that, as well as of the exchange of prisoners. So only the prisoners who didn’t commit any war crimes could be exchanged.” Asked if Shysimarin could be exchanged with Ukrainian prisoners, his lawyer replied: “Theoretically an exchange is possible. But it’s a separate process. Any prisoner of war could be exchanged.” The Kremlin has said it has no information about the trial and that the absence of a diplomatic mission in Ukraine limits its ability to provide legal assistance, but has denied its soldiers committed war crimes. The trial is being seen as a public test of the independence of Ukraine’s judicial system. A verdict is expected on Monday.

5/20/2022,"In early 1987, on the eve of the first Palestinian intifada, Shireen Abu Aqleh left her family home in East Jerusalem and crossed the Jordan valley to begin university in Amman. It was a familiar journey for a young Palestinian with her life ahead of her: leaving her homeland for an education and to find her place in the world. Abu Aqleh’s first career choice – architecture – was fleeting. After a semester she chose journalism, and transferred to a vocation that would build her name and establish understandings across the Arab world during an acclaimed 25-year career, which ended by the side of a West Bank road earlier this month as she covered an Israeli raid. By the time of her death, at the age of 51, the journalist had come to be known as the voice of the Palestinian conflict. Reporting for Al Jazeera for most of that time, she had become a go-to voice, an advocate for the people of Gaza and the West Bank, and the Palestinians scattered across the region and beyond. From her graduation at Yarmouk University, through her return to the East Jerusalem suburb of Beit Hanina – where she grew up, the daughter of Louli and Nasri Abu Aqleh, and went to Rosary Sisters high school – Abu Aqleh had found her calling. Journalism would allow her to bring the stories of her people to the world and it would give her a central role in the greatest cause of her life. In the first instance, so too would development work. After a brief spell with UNRWA (the UN agency for Palestinian refugees) in the early 1990s, Abu Aqleh began reporting with the radio station Voice of Palestine, where she honed her skills as a broadcast journalist. By then the seething rage of the uprising had given way to the Oslo peace process. Yasser Arafat, Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres would win the 1994 Nobel peace prize and, for a while at least, a hint of optimism crept into a conflict that had held the region in its grip for decades. For many in the occupied territories it would remain a false dawn. And from the time Abu Aqleh moved to Al Jazeera in 1997, she found herself at the forefront of a story that became ever more bitterly contested and increasingly difficult to cover. She quickly learned that the relentless scrutiny of vested interests came with the territory. The conflict was thrashed out and defined as much on television screens and in newspapers as it was in the streets of the occupied territories and Israel. Strident criticism became a constant companion to Abu Aqleh’s reporting, as it did to others who devoted their careers to trying to make sense of the maddening and opaque ways of the Middle East, where journalism and advocacy often dance an awkward tango. Abu Aqleh’s answer to critics was simple and effective. She was a field reporter, who allowed the voices of the people to tell their stories; and in doing so speak to a bigger picture, which made often complex themes digestible for viewers. By the time of the second intifada, she had become a household name far beyond her homeland. She was known as a reporter who told stories with soul, and who never gave up on a beat that had lost steam and viewers as hopes of a two-state solution were replaced by grinding stalemate amid outbursts of savage violence. As the capacity of Palestinian leaders to tell their stories of the conflict waned, Abu Aqleh took on a quasi-public diplomacy role, articulating what officials often failed to get across. “She was an attraction for Palestinians, because she was saying what we wanted to say and we didn’t know how to say it,” said her friend, the activist Muzna Shihabi. “She was on good terms with everyone. From the refugee camp to the Palestinian Authority to regular people in Ramallah.” As an East Jerusalem resident, Abu Aqleh could move between Israel and the West Bank, seeing the best and worst of two very different societies. She sometimes met Israeli officials, but her commitment remained undeniably to telling the stories of her people. Abu Aqleh had told friends that she longed to cover the freedom of Palestinian prisoners serving time in Israel and the reunification of the Palestinian political blocs, Hamas, which rules Gaza, and Fatah, which holds sway in the West Bank. Neither side has constructively engaged with the other since a brief civil war in Gaza in 2007. Abu Aqleh was a staunch Palestinian nationalist. As the model for peace between Israel and the Palestinians, a two-state solution, slipped further away in recent years, her sense of identity solidified. She remained strongly opposed to violence and committed to telling stories in ways that people could connect with. But the strain of the conflict had left her fatigued. On the morning of 11 May, Abu Aqleh stood by a roadside wearing her flak jacket, clearly marked “press”, and a helmet. Gunfire crackled nearby. And then came a burst of fire directed at her and a colleague. Her employers accuse Israeli forces of firing the fatal shot. Israeli officials suggest Palestinian gunmen may have instead been responsible. In life and in death Abu Aqleh remained central to the war of narrative. She is survived by her brother, Tony.  Shireen Abu Aqleh, journalist, born 13 April 1971; died 11 May 2022",News/World news,Shireen Abu Aqleh obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/shireen-abu-aqleh-obituary
5/20/2022,"Ihave recently been thinking about the way we treat people who have broken the law. There is a significant philosophical issue here regarding the kind of societies we, as members of a globalised world, want to live in: if you have lived in a place since infancy or childhood and you commit a crime in that place, should you be punished in that place? Or should you be deported back to the country of your birth? These questions come to mind as I read about the UK’s deportation flights. According to analysis by a campaign group, published in the Guardian last week, of 20 Jamaicans facing one recent deportation flight, the majority arrived in Britain as children. (The flight left this week with seven people on board; others remained in the UK pending legal challenges.) In Jamaica we are no strangers to families being permanently torn apart, with some members sent thousands of miles away. We all know those dark days in our history. In November 2020, the Jamaican high commissioner and the UK government agreed that people who arrived in the UK aged 12 or under should not be deported, and many people were removed from a planned flight in December 2020 on this basis. We would hope that the UK will honour this agreement. We need to have an open and honest debate about this. Is it humane to displace human beings from one country to another, where they may not have lived for decades and no longer have connections? Is it fair to the recipient country who would now have to bear the burden of trying to reintegrate that person into a society that is foreign to them? And is it fair to that person, who not only has to pay their debt to society through imprisonment but has the additional punishment of having to rebuild their life in a country thousands of miles from home? Please do not misunderstand me, I believe there is a need for immigration laws. And I believe that people who violate those laws should be punished. But it does seem excessive and cruel to separate them from their wives, husbands and children. After all, this could lead to the broken homes and broken spirits that, over time, could evolve into more antisocial behaviour. The director of Detention Action, Bella Sankey, points to what appears to be a hostile and discriminatory approach to mass deportations that disproportionately target black and brown people, some of whom committed low-level, non-violent offences for which they have served their sentence and been successfully rehabilitated. As a Jamaican politician, it is not my role to take sides in political decisions in the UK. However, it is my obligation to ensure that Jamaican citizens at home and abroad are treated fairly. Indeed, it would be very easy for many to point to our own government and cast aspersions – saying that I have no right to comment when our house indeed has problems too. But this “whataboutery” does not excuse the practice of plucking people out of their homes and sending them halfway around the world, especially when some have built small businesses, paid taxes and built homes and communities in the UK. I do not claim to have the answers to these questions, and there certainly must be a balance. But I would like to offer some principles. First, we should try to keep families together because we all know the importance of the family unit to the development of safe, productive and happy communities. Therefore, access to advocacy support for family perspectives to be heard is crucial so children are not suddenly torn from their parents and faced with lifelong trauma. Second, punishment should be handled in the community where the crime was committed. And third, if there must be a relocation, there must also be a process for reintegrating that family safely and productively in their new home. If we can follow these broad principles, we can craft a sensible immigration policy with attendant crime and punishment clauses in accordance with the international treaties that govern the way states must interact with each other. A Jamaican proverb says, “Nuh romp wid mawga cow, a cudda bull mumma”: don’t play with a skinny cow because it could be the bull’s mother. Or, don’t disregard or discard people who may seem weak or insignificant as you don’t know where they come from or how they’ve influenced shaping your life. So let us forge a better approach that is based on respect for our common humanity.

5/20/2022,"Women who were deceived into intimate relationships with undercover police officers have said it is “beyond belief” they will have to wait a further two years for the public inquiry into the undercover policing scandal to hold any further public hearings. The slow-moving inquiry is scheduled to complete its current round of hearings on Friday and is not due to question any further witnesses in public until spring 2024. Police Spies out of Lives, a group that represents women deceived into intimate relationships by undercover officers, said: “The idea that we have to wait until 2024 for the next tranche of hearings is beyond belief. Justice delayed is justice denied. We urge the inquiry to rethink this timeframe.” The public inquiry is on course to become one of the longest ever. Set up originally in 2015, it is not expected to end before 2026. The long gap until the next set of hearings has been criticised by victims of the surveillance who are frustrated and angered that it is taking a long time to establish how they were monitored. Many blame the police for deliberately dragging out the inquiry. Retired judge Sir John Mitting, the inquiry’s chair, is examining the conduct of 139 undercover officers who spied on more than 1,000 mainly leftwing and progressive political groups in secret operations between 1968 and at least 2010. The longevity of his inquiry could match another that is infamous for the length of time it took to complete – Lord Saville’s inquiry into the killing of 13 unarmed civilians by British soldiers on Bloody Sunday lasted 12 years. The so-called “spy cops” inquiry, which has so far cost £50m, was commissioned by Theresa May when she was home secretary and was initially expected to finish by 2018. It was set up after a series of revelations about the misconduct of undercover police officers, who spied on the campaign for justice run by the parents of Stephen Lawrence after he was killed by a racist gang. At least 20 undercover officers deceived women into intimate relationships, often lasting years. Four officers are known, or are alleged, to have fathered children with women they met during covert deployments. The undercover officers routinely stole the identities of dead children to use as fake personas during deployments that usually lasted four years. So far the inquiry has held three rounds of public hearings, across 26 days, which scrutinised the undercover operations between 1968 and 1982. These included monitoring of campaigners against apartheid and the Vietnam war, and feminist activists. The latest round, spanning two weeks, questioned the senior managers who were responsible for supervising the undercover officers. Many gave curt and vague answers or claimed that they could not recall events. A spokesman for the inquiry said “a significant amount of work needs to be completed” before the next hearings, which will look at the covert operations between 1983 and 1992. He added that inquiry staff needed to process evidence relating to more than 150 undercover officers, their managers and those who were infiltrated, adding that hundreds of documents needed to checked before they could be made public. This next phase is likely to include the infiltration of campaigners against nuclear weapons and the poll tax, and an alleged firebombing of a Debenhams store by police spy Bob Lambert in 1987 – a claim he denies. Before the next set of hearings, Mitting is intending to publish a report of his findings on the early years of the covert operations. In the latest hearings, all the managers maintained that they did not know that the undercover officers they were overseeing had formed sexual relationships with women. The inquiry has heard that these relationships were “endemic and common” from the 1970s onwards.",News/UK news,"Spy cops inquiry delays ‘beyond belief’, say women deceived by officers",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/20/spy-cops-inquiry-delays-beyond-belief-say-women-deceived-by-officers
5/20/2022,"Millions of Germans are expected to take advantage of a summer of cheaper travel from next month under government plans to boost public transport use and give financial relief to consumers facing a cost of living crisis. A €9 a month ticket scheme is to be introduced from 1 June allowing travel on all modes of city and regional transport. A different ticket will apply for each region and it will be available for three months until the end of August. Germany’s upper house of parliament approved the move on Friday, following on from the Bundestag on Thursday. The scheme will cost the government €2.5 bn as it is due to pay back to transport companies the shortfall in income as well as the cost of administering the sale, including giving back to commuters who already have season tickets, the amount they are effectively out of pocket. The cost of the ticket is a fraction of the normal cost of travel, amounting to around a sixth of the price of the cheapest monthly ticket available for Berlin’s central zones. The scheme is in response to rising energy prices and is intended to offer everyone from commuters and weekend trippers who might normally choose to take the car, the chance to out the benefits of public transport. However, detractors have warned of overcrowded trains, buses and trams – some of which are already full to capacity – and restrictions on taking bicycles and prams due to lack of space. They suggest that when the experiment is over, ticket prices might have been pushed up considerably by a further expected rise in inflation making public transport less attractive. Volker Wissing, Germany’s transport minister, of the pro-business FDP called the €9 ticket a “huge opportunity” for climate-friendly mobility in Germany. He told parliament the scheme was already a success before it had launched “as everyone in Germany is talking about public transport”. Katharina Dröge, the parliamentary head of the Green party, said the ticket would be welcome by those who are feeling the strain of inflation. “For those who are looking for ways of saving, the €9 ticket is an important measure,” she said. “We hope as many people take advantage of it as possible.” Deutsche Bahn, the national rail operator and the biggest participant in the project, said it planned to start selling the tickets on Monday. Some sales of smaller operators have already sold tickets. Hamburg is to start today and others do so at the weekend. Jens Hilgenberg, a transport expert for the Association of Environment and Nature Protection (Bund), told DPA he welcomed the move, however he said it would send an even more important signal if the government were to improve ticket prices and transport across the country, particularly in rural areas where people are most reliant on their cars. “The €9 ticket does not mean that any extra bus will be available in rural areas but this is where alternatives to the car need to be increased greatly,” he said. Critics who welcome the attempt to lure people from their cars have at the same time decried the fact that the government is planning to reduce the burden on all car drivers over the same period with a reduction in the energy tax on petrol which in turn means a fall in the VAT on it. According to the finance ministry petrol will be reduced by 35.2 cents per litre, and diesel by 16.7 cents.",News/World news,Germany plans public transport boost with €9 a month ticket,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/germany-public-transport-boost-9-euro-month-ticket
5/20/2022,"Among the ingredients generally held to create problems for wine, salads – or, more particularly, salad dressings – rank high on the list. However, that prejudice stems from a time when “salad” was a green one with a sharp, French vinaigrette, and the wine more often than not an oak-aged bordeaux. These days, though, salads come in all shapes and sizes, and are often the main point of a meal. There may also be more than one on the table, so there’s no point in being too precious about what you serve with them. It’s more useful, perhaps, to think mainly in terms of wines that won’t work so well with them, among which I’d probably put full-bodied reds such as cabernet sauvignon or shiraz, though even those work just fine in the context of salads that include lentils or other pulses. Charred vegetable salads are also game-changers. For instance, you might not usually think of drinking an oaky chardonnay with a salad, but if it includes grilled or roast corn or butternut squash, it’s going to be a winner. That said, the wines I generally turn to are fresh crisp whites and rosés (think of, say, the classic pairing of Provençal rosé and salade niçoise). Sauvignon blanc, with its marked, citrus character, is an obvious choice at this time of year, especially with salads that include asparagus and goat’s cheese; it’s good with tomato salads, too (there’s often a tomato stalk aroma in sauvignon). Smooth, creamy whites such as soave and chenin blanc go with creamy dressings such as for caesar salad; revisit the unfairly out-of-favour vouvray (see today’s pick), too. And aromatic whites such as pinot gris and riesling (Australian ones in particular) work well with south-east Asian-influenced salads that include the likes of lime, coriander and fish sauce – the Tesco wine below in my pick is a longstanding favourite. As for reds, keep them fruity and not too long in the tooth. Fresh, young reds will echo any red fruits in a salad, including dried berries such as barberries or cherries, and will pick up on any meaty element in the form of crisp streaky bacon or air-dried ham. If you are drinking a serious wine and want to make your salad more wine-friendly, it’s obviously best to avoid very hot or spicy dressings. Even with a vinaigrette, a touch of cream or chicken stock will offset the sharpness of the vinegar; herbs such as chervil and especially tarragon can also be a help. Honestly, the wine and salad problem is hugely overstated. Extra Special Vouvray Chenin Blanc 2020 £7.25 Asda, 13%. Vouvray’s out of fashion, but this off-dry chenin with a hint of honey. Would be great with a creamy chicken salad. Good price, too. The Pebble Sauvignon Blanc Val de Loire 2021 £9 Tesco (£8 for Clubcard members), 12%. Classic Loire sauvignon blanc, and way cheaper than sancerre. Try with a goat’s cheese salad. Finest Tingleup Riesling 2021 £9, Tesco, 12.5%. I’ve lost count of the times I’ve recommended this wine, but the 2021 vintage is as good as ever. Perfect for a Thai or Burmese-style salad. Domaine Girard ‘Garriguette’ Rosé 2020 £12.75 Yapp Brothers, 13.5%. Gorgeous, fruity Languedoc rosé made, unusually for the area, from cabernet franc. Could take several different salads in its stride. Laurent Martray Brouilly La Folie 2018 £206.40 a case (£17.17 a bottle) plus delivery Justerini & Brooks, 13%. Not the cheapest beaujolais out there, but utterly delicious. Would be great with a rare roast beef or lamb salad.

5/20/2022,"I have struggled with depression and anxiety since my teens and have had therapy and medication on and off since I was 17 (I am now 37). I’m aware of deep-rooted low self-esteem and shame. I feel worthless. I never want to draw attention to myself and have a paralysing fear of confrontation. I have managed to maintain a few close friendships, have worked in the past, and am married with two kids. So I appear “successful” on the surface. Things really spiralled when I had my kids, specifically my youngest, two years ago. My anxiety went off the charts and my thoughts went very dark. Covid likely had an impact, too. My world has become small. I have moved countries three times in recent years, a result of my husband’s job (I’ve been a willing participant). I decided not to work when we moved again and instead focus on retraining. But I found the process gruelling and the work placement stressful and overwhelming. I love my kids but feel the life has been sucked out of me. With my first child I was doing further studies, which was difficult, but it felt as if I had an outside purpose. I believe my anxiety is rooted in fear of judgment, that people will think me a fraud, and not a real mother: I don’t really cook, am not crafty, and am just generally a bit of an all-round loser. My eldest is four and has always been quite happy-go-lucky, but my fear is my kids will inherit my anxiety. Both start in daycare/school shortly and I will get some much-needed free time. But I just don’t know how to live any more. I have completely lost myself. I do have a professional therapist who is excellent, but I’d like a different perspective. I do sense a theme, one of displacement, disempowerment and overwhelm. What happened to you when you were 17? There is a dissonance between what you’ve done, and how you feel. What I see is a woman who has moved countries (each time uprooting herself, I could not do this), had children, worked, retrained, completed a placement, done further studies. I’ve done two of those things – if you are a failure, what am I? Your letter reminded me of those pin art models – the ones where you push a hand into blunt pins to make a 3D image. But what you’re doing is squishing down everything that’s good, to leave in relief everything that you think is bad about you. But you know, when you turn those 3D pictures around, there’s a whole different perspective. I contacted Jo Stubley, a consultant psychiatrist in psychotherapy. Stubley explained that many of us learn over time that how we might feel about ourselves may not be how everyone else views us. “You seem to think everyone else thinks you’re rubbish [because you do], but they have a different perspective to you.” Your inner critic is so strong that you have set a narrative for yourself that’s incredibly powerful. I wonder where this comes from? Whose voice is in your head telling you you’re not enough? Honestly, your children don’t care if you’re not crafty or can’t really cook; they care that you love them and that you’re there. Stubley and I wondered who knows how you really feel? When we feel we are an impostor, we present a “false self” to the world, a version we think is more palatable. And it works for a while but it’s not sustainable, and it actually keeps people at bay, and stops them helping you. Do you present this side to your therapist? It’s really important that you are honest with him/her, maybe even show them the letter you wrote to me? Stubley wondered where your anger was? Squished right down? That might be exhausting. If I were you I’d be pretty miffed at having to move countries so many times and give up my job. No wonder you feel lost. There is a future for you, of course there is, but these massive feelings have to be processed bit by bit. Please tell your husband how you feel and/or your closest friend – they don’t have to be geographically close. Also: allow yourself to get angry and not turn everything inwards. Use the time you have coming up to do what makes you feel good sometimes. It doesn’t have to be complicated, or a big thing. Asking yourself, “What do I need right now?” when you feel overwhelmed is a really useful exercise: it’s honestly saved my sanity these past few years.

5/20/2022,"Steven Gerrard has said he is disappointed his integrity has been questioned before the former Liverpool captain takes his Aston Villa side to Manchester City but conceded the dream scenario would be if his current and former club profit on the final day. If Villa take points off City they would hand the Premier League title to Liverpool, providing Jürgen Klopp’s side secure victory at home to Wolves, but for Villa the sole focus is on attempting to secure a top-half finish in the top division for the first time since 2011. Questions were asked about how Villa would approach last week’s home game against Liverpool, when they put in a battling performance before losing 2-1. Gerrard’s selection against Burnley on Thursday was then studied for signs he was resting players for the City game, but only Danny Ings being a substitute was a notable break from the recent norm and that followed the striker starting four matches in the previous 21 days. Gerrard said “the phone has been busy” in the buildup to the end-of-season finale and raised the issue of integrity himself. “In terms of Liverpool, I totally understand and respect the external noise and the questions that have been coming my way for some time,” Gerrard said. “They’re involved in a title race, and I spent a lot of time there. It is disappointing when people mention integrity and aim it towards me or Aston Villa or any of my players. We’ll go out at the weekend and give it everything we’ve got to try to get points for Aston Villa and our supporters. If that inevitably helps Liverpool, fantastic.” Gerrard believes Klopp and Pep Guardiola, such is the strength of their respective teams, have created a buffer between them and the rest of the league. “When I played there was a lot of talk about the top four and for a period that became a top six,” Gerrard said. “But I think it has become quite clear that in the last two or three years that with Jürgen and Pep’s consistency since José [Mourinho] left – he finished second at Manchester United just before he left – they have been the strongest teams for a long time now and there is a gap forming. “In terms of my experience being back in the Premier League, they have been the two best sides by far that we have faced. Very different: one tries to hurt you with positional play and possession and one tries to hurt you with speed and intensity. They are both extremely consistent and have got top managers. They have both recruited extremely well over a period of time and had a lot of time to work with the team so it is no surprise that they get the results that they do.” Gerrard knows Villa face a difficult task given City have lost only twice at home in the league and have not dropped points in successive league games since December 2020. “They’ve got world-class players and a top manager, but there is a lot of pressure on them at the weekend,” he said. “We will go there as best prepared as we can and try to make it as difficult as we can. Why?

Right now, one of the hottest projects at the Cannes film festival market, where rights are sold to as-yet-unmade films – is the sequel to This Is Spinal Tap, a film released 38 years ago. This Christmas we’ll get the sequel to James Cameron’s blockbuster Avatar, which in contrast is practically sprinting to the gate a mere 13 years after its first appearance. In between, this summer will see the arrival of The Railway Children Return, a sequel to the beloved family classic, 52 years later. Reboots, remakes and sequels have been Hollywood’s life blood for decades now, but the profusion of “belated sequels” appears to be reaching epidemic proportions, where even the most ancient material can be picked up and dusted down for a new audience. Top Gun: Maverick, in which Tom Cruise revisits his 80s hotshot navy pilot character in middle age, joins the likes of Indiana Jones, Ghostbusters, Jurassic World, Rambo, Mad Max and Star Wars in attempting to convert fan nostalgia for a successful franchise into a new mass-appeal blockbuster. Steven Gaydos, executive editor of Variety magazine says the phenomenon is simply a new variant on Hollywood’s big-money plays. “Hollywood hates risk,” he says. “It’s in the risk-aversion business, so everything must be pre-sold. When we talk about ‘belated sequels’, we are talking about the giant need to invest in things that have already worked. The common denominator is risk reduction.” Gaydos adds: “That they were a long time ago is not the point. If something ever worked in any form, ever, it has a better chance of getting greenlit as it has audience awareness. What Hollywood and the conglomerates who run it really detest is what we call originality.” Top Gun: Maverick is following a well-established track for sequels to what Robert Mitchell, director of theatrical insights for box office analysts Gower Street Analytics, calls “legacy” films. The hope, he says, is that they will appeal to fans of the original, as well as a new generation who may have come to it later. “You definitely want to get the legacy audience who are already familiar with it and love it, and you also want to bring in a new audience who may not know or care much about the legacy characters – so you create new characters for them.” “The economics of the film industry mean you can’t make enough money to break even just on the legacy audience. So Top Gun: Maverick has got a whole cast of young actors, amazing aerial footage, in-camera stunts, which are there to excite everybody – as well as Tom Cruise returning to his star-making role. The hope is that will be intriguing enough for people to come in huge numbers.” Anna Smith, host of the Girls on Film podcast, also points out the generational shift: “I suspect part of it is that the Top Gun fans have grown up and gone into the industry and are helping to support these kinds of releases, whether they’re on the production side or journalism or elsewhere.” Mitchell suggests that Cruise’s persona will be crucial to the film’s success. “The interesting thing is that Cruise is a marketing thing in himself. In the years since the original Top Gun, the films that have really kept him at the top are the Mission Impossible series, and they are renowned for Cruise doing his own stunts. People are psyched for this visceral element to Top Gun: Maverick, and sells it to people who may not be old enough to have seen Top Gun, but know him from the Mission films.” The best-performing “legacy sequels” appear to be the ones that combine both elements of past and present: a toehold in the original, via familiar actors and narratives, alongside fresher, more up-to-date characters and cast. Mitchell cites impressive results for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, released in 2008, 19 years after the previous one, as a turning point – “there were a lot of people speculating at the time whether it would work, and whether anyone cared any more about Harrison Ford” – with the subsequent success of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Jurassic World in 2015 cementing the trend. “Both were billion-dollar global mega hits, and both showed there was more ground to walk in these franchises – especially, in the case of the Force Awakens, if you could get the original cast back in.” Mitchell adds: “This was some something that the Ghostbusters franchise learned. Unfortunately a lot of the reaction to the 2016 parallel universe was nasty and misogynist, but there was a lot of genuine reaction from fans who asked: how can you do Ghostbusters without the originals involved at all?” Although many of these legacy sequels are based on already popular franchises with a mass fanbase, it is not always the case. The pop-culture dial can work in unlikely ways and benefit from long-term viral interest. The 2010 hit Tron: Legacy was a sequel to the virtual reality thriller Tron from 1982, a film that acquired a fervent cult following over the years but had only modest box office success – a far cry from Top Gun or Star Wars. Mitchell says that Tron: Legacy’s solid showing demonstrated that “studios could exploit different things in their catalogue”. Hence the arrival of films such as Blade Runner 2049 in 2017, and Bill & Ted Face the Music, released in 2020 – both of which derive from much-admired but commercially modest predecessors. Avatar, on the other hand, appears to have a different path to release. As Gaydos says: “Avatar 2 has been in the works since Avatar.” In the wake of the film’s box office success, becoming the highest grossing film of all time, director James Cameron announced a series of sequels, which have continually been in active development since. Gaydos says: “You might think this dedication to the characters and world building is enigmatic and eccentric – if you can call someone so successful that – but Cameron has been making the Avatar sequels since he made Avatar. They are just taking forever to come out.”",Arts/Film,Top Gun: Maverick and the unstoppable rise of the ‘legacy sequel’,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/20/top-gun-maverick-avatar-spinal-tap-legacy-sequel-hollywood
5/20/2022,"It is perhaps the most recognisable and beloved spaceship in movie history – a battered old warrior of a vessel that got Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and the rest of the Star Wars crew out of – and into – a string of sci-fi scrapes. What is not so well known is that the Millennium Falcon, or at least a full-size model of it, was the last major craft to be built at a dockyard in south-west Wales. A new permanent exhibition was launched at the Pembroke Dock Heritage Centre on Friday telling the story of how the Falcon was secretly put together in the late 1970s in a hangar previously used to build flying boats. “We’re very excited,” said Mark Williams, a local Star Wars expert who has been overseeing the project for seven years. “It’s extraordinary to think the original Millennium Falcon for the Empire Strikes Back was made by shipbuilders here.” The Falcon appeared in the 1977 film Star Wars, with Luke Skywalker initially dismissing Han Solo’s craft as a “piece of junk”. Williams explained that after the success of the film, the decision was made to build a lifesized version for the second movie, which was first screened in 1980. George Lucas’s people looked to south-west Wales because the shipbuilders of Pembroke Dock had the expertise and the room for such an ambitious undertaking. There was also a Hollywood link: local craftspeople had previously built one of the sets used in Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey. The workers on the Falcon were sworn to secrecy as the craft took shape in the Western Sunderland hangar, referring to it by a codename, the Magic Roundabout. But whispers soon began to circulate that a “flying saucer” was being built. Williams said: “One of the workers finally cracked under pressure when his sons heard him talking about it with his wife. He said he’d tell them but they had to promise not to discuss it with anyone. The boys dutifully promised, then told the whole school the next day. The cat was out of the bag.” The craft was constructed out of steel and marine plywood and had a compressed air system that could lift it off the ground by a couple of inches, allowing it to be moved around more easily. When it was complete, the 23-tonne model was broken into 16 pieces and moved by lorry to Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire where it was put back together. Sadly, after filming the wood was burned and the metal sold for scrap. The new exhibition, supported by national lottery money, uses models, photos, videos and the testimony of some of the men who worked on the ship. Pam George, a town councillor, was among those attending the launch event on Friday, alongside a Darth Vader and stormtroopers. “I think it’s wonderful that we’re showing off a hidden bit of our town,” she said. George’s husband, Raymond, worked at the docks at the time. “There were all these rumours going around and then this ship that had been created here was there on the big screen,” he said. George said she hoped Star Wars fans would travel from around the world to view the exhibition. “Like everywhere, we’re feeling the pinch. We’re hoping it will provide a nice economic boost to the town. We’re very proud of our Star Wars connection.” The exhibition, The Millennium Falcon – The Last Ship Built in the Royal Pembroke Dockyard, opens to the public on Monday.",News/UK news,Millennium Falcon exhibition opens in Welsh town where ship was built,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/20/millennium-falcon-exhibition-opens-in-welsh-town-where-ship-was-built
5/20/2022,"Wilderness therapy and access to green space may help domestic abuse survivors heal while improving therapy outcomes, a study has found. Scientists from the University of Essex worked with the Wilderness Foundation, a charity that offers outdoor therapy programmes, to see if treatment in the natural world could work better, or alongside, traditional methods. In its Blossom programme, which helps survivors of domestic violence, patients take part in outdoor group therapy as well as learning outdoor survival skills such as making shelter and fire and making arts and crafts from foraged materials. The foundation, which works with more than 7,000 people each year, is displaying a garden at Chelsea flower show, which shows some of the plants and methods used by those in its various programmes. This year, the charity is applying for funding from the Ministry of Justice, which has ringfenced £16m for support services for domestic abuse survivors. Findings from the University of Essex pilot study, which included 12 women and eight adolescents, showed that self-esteem increased 15% in programme participants by the end of the study, and wellbeing by 52%, and there was a 30% increase in average resilience scores. More research with bigger groups will soon be under way, but scientists believe that this result is promising. Kirsty Shanks, who led the research, said: “What people spoke about was a sense of belonging, a sense of community that they’d got from the project.” She added that though the project was multifaceted and included therapy groups, activities and community building, the main positive people got from it was the access to nature. Shanks added: “What underpinned it all was actually being outdoors, being in nature, the impact that that had on people. That was something that everybody spoke about.” Much of the work is about rebuilding self-esteem after abuse, and the study participants said being in nature helped them to recover. A recent literature review by Natural England in conjunction with the charity Mind has found that nature therapy can help mental health. “Throughout this published evidence base, there is therefore consensus that nature contributes to enhanced wellbeing, mental development and personal fulfilment,” the authors concluded. The medical profession is slowly adopting nature therapy, with some GPs now prescribing gardening and other outdoor activities to people with mild mental health issues. Jo Roberts, the CEO of the Wilderness Foundation, said: “A lot of our work is around rebuilding the self, because domestic abuse erodes people, it takes away confidence and a sense of self, someone else’s, almost kind of sucking your life force out of you. “There is huge amount of science in the background, whether it’s to do with neuroscience of nature, how fractal patterns of trees is changing how we think using things like attention, and restoration therapy. Cortisol levels reduce when you are out in nature.” A survivor, who did not want to be named, told the Guardian about her experience with the programme. “First, you might sit there and think this is a bit hippy,” she said. “But actually, it wakes you up, it makes you realise actually you are still alive and that you are someone. “In the last sort of therapy I had, in a little room, it made me feel like I was getting more and more boxed in. But you can come here and talk about how you feel, and it disperses into the air. And it doesn’t leave it with you. When you’re in a little room, it makes you feel like you’ve got to go home and wash all of the sadness off you.” The women in the group managed to become closer through their activities in nature. “When you’re connected to the wilderness, it makes you feel like you are part of something because, I don’t know if all women of domestic abuse feel the same, but you feel so on your own, even if you’re surrounded by other people. “It’s been so helpful to make me feel like an actual somebody rather than an entity that just floats around, stays away from everything and everyone. It saves my life nearly every day.” Many survivors find it hard to access therapy and help, because of funding cuts by successive Conservative governments. Those involved in the study stressed that it was helpful because it was long-term, and the scientists have recommended more funding for such therapies. Roberts said: “When you’re in nature, you’re much more slowed down. We might have to scurry if suddenly the heavens open on us and we’ve got to get to a shelter but basically nothing is rushed. So you’re almost slowing your heart rate down.” She also pointed to research showing that activities such as forest bathing can reduce levels of cortisol, the hormone associated with stress. It is important to have wilderness facilities at therapy centres, because many don’t have access to nature at home, she said. “The work of the foundation is about fighting our corners to make sure that we maintain green space for people.” The benefits of green spaces need to be for everyone, she argued. “We really want to make sure that our programmes are accessible to people who don’t have access to their own large landscape or their own big gardens. We want to make sure that we’ve got spaces for people, any person, to access nature in some way.”",News/Society,Space to grow: wilderness therapy could help abuse survivors,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/20/green-spaces-help-abuse-survivors-essex-university
5/20/2022,"Greek pop music of the 1960s is not an area of musical history where anyone who doesn’t fondly remember it first-hand is advised to dwell. There are a few exceptions – garage rock collectors have unearthed a string of obscure, impressively raw singles by the Stormies, the Persons and the Girls – but the archetypical mainstream Greek response to the rise of the Beatles might be Vangelis Papathanassiou’s band the Forminx, who dealt in novelty instrumentals, weedy Hellenic-accented stabs at Merseybeat and a side order of lachrymose balladry. The Forminx were successful in Greece, but it clearly wasn’t enough for Papathanassiou, who claimed his earliest musical endeavours involved experimenting, John Cage-style, with the sound of radio interference. After the Forminx broke up, he took up a career writing film scores before forming Aphrodite’s Child with another refugee from the Greek beat scene, singer and bassist Demis Roussos. They were a completely different proposition from anything that had emerged from the country before, a product of the anything-goes atmosphere engendered by psychedelia. Their first two albums, Heaven and Hell and It’s Five O’Clock, offered a vast range of styles that had sprung up around the summer of love, from droning raga-rock on The Grass Is No Green to A Whiter Shade of Pale-inspired balladry on It’s Five O’Clock’s gorgeous title track; from You Always Stand In My Way’s heavy riffing to Mister Thomas’s mock vaudeville. Crucially, they didn’t just sound like a pale imitation: Roussos’s vocals – high, tremulous, but powerful – clearly weren’t from an Anglo-American rock tradition; nor was their use of bouzouki. In fact, Aphrodite’s Child occasionally didn’t sound like anyone else, as on the amazing warped funk-rock of Funky Mary. This uniqueness was underlined on their masterpiece, 1972’s astonishing double concept album 666, which delivered 77 minutes of wildly experimental music that touched on jazz, proto-metal, prog and stuff that still defies explication: it’s variously becalmed, richly melodic, punishingly heavy and, on ∞ (Infinity), unsettling. It was an incredible achievement, but it attracted less attention than the band’s earlier European hit singles. In any case, by the time of its release, Aphrodite’s Child had split, the other band members apparently unhappy with the increasingly avant-garde direction Papathanassiou’s music was taking. Roussos subsequently became a huge MOR star; Papathanassiou’s fantastic 1973 solo album Earth continued in 666’s eclectic vein, skipping from slinky funk that would subsequently be claimed by Balearic DJs (Let It Happen) to the pounding Come On, to We Are All Uprooted, an eerie, drum machine-driven track that seemed to address Greeks who, like Papathanassiou, had fled the country in the wake of the 1968 military coup. In a sense, it was a shame he didn’t make more albums in that vein, but his attention was increasingly attracted by soundtracks and synthesisers: he relocated to London, built a studio in Marylebone and started scoring films and releasing electronic concept albums that positioned him as a kind of Greek equivalent to Jean Michel Jarre or Tangerine Dream, albeit of a more dramatic, grandiose bent. Something of 666’s apocalyptic intensity lingered around 1975’s Heaven and Hell, and Odes, the album of Greek songs he recorded with actor Irene Papas (although 1979’s album China and his acclaimed soundtrack to the nature documentary Opera Sauvage were easier on the ear). He also unexpectedly developed a parallel career as a pop star, in the company of Yes vocalist Jon Anderson, an Aphrodite’s Child fan who had contributed to Heaven and Hell and Opera Sauvage. The three albums they released as Jon and Vangelis deftly bridged the gap between prog rock and the vogue for synth-pop. The songs were often long (the title track of 1981’s The Friends of Mr Cairo lasted the best part of 15 minutes) and, as always with Anderson, the lyrics tended to the opaque and ponderous – but Papathanassiou’s music was richly melodic and the sound of Anderson’s high voice in an electronic landscape was appealing. I Hear You Now, from their first album together, Short Stories, and I’ll Find My Way Home, from The Friends of Mr Cairo, were British hit singles, but their most lasting track proved to be the emotive State of Independence, from the same album, and subsequently alighted on by producer Quincy Jones and covered, brilliantly, by Donna Summer. By the time Anderson and Papathanassiou’s partnership ended in 1983, the latter was also a star in his own right. His breakthrough came with his Oscar-winning soundtrack to Chariots of Fire. The soaring, valedictory feel of its theme – another hit single, inescapable in 1981 – fitted the movie’s mood so well that the anachronism of having a film set in the 1920s soundtracked by 80s electronics passed almost unnoticed. His subsequent soundtrack to Ridley Scott’s Blade Runner was even better. Murkier, more abstract and far more emotionally ambiguous than the air-punch-inducing Chariots of Fire, its legend was bolstered by the fact that it wasn’t released as an album for over 20 years: a rotten orchestral version, which Scott and Papathanassiou hated, came out in its absence. Their success led to more soundtracks (although Papathanassiou was choosy about the films he worked on) and a series of 80s instrumental albums. Soil Festivities, from 1984, was the most commercially successful, but the best might be the following year’s sparse, dark and largely atonal Invisible Connections: if its contents came out tomorrow, on a limited-edition cassette released by an underground label, hip retailers such as Boomkat would be all over it. At the other extreme, it didn’t require too much imagination to picture some numbers from 1988’s appropriately named Direct retooled as the backing tracks for hit singles. However, Papathanassiou resisted the temptation to turn his hand to pop production, his releases increasingly drifting towards new age and classical styles, punctuated by the occasional blockbusting soundtrack or event. The theme from Ridley Scott’s 1492: Conquest of Paradise gained a second lease of life as a suitably stirring accompaniment to sporting events – boxers, cricket teams and rugby league sides have all used it as intro music. He provided themes for Nasa’s Mars Odyssey mission, for the 2000 summer Olympics, wrote music to accompany the landing of the European Space Agency’s Rosetta mission, and scored Stephen Hawking’s memorial service, the latter music beamed by the ESA into the nearest black hole to Earth. Then again, Papathanassiou didn’t need to dabble in rock and pop music: by the 1990s, his impact on those genres had become clear. Like Tangerine Dream’s soundtrack to Risky Business, his score for Blade Runner – finally released in 1994 – became a set text within dance music, repeatedly covered by trance artists, sampled by the Future Sound of London, Unkle, Air and drum’n’bass producer Dillinja (Boards of Canada, meanwhile, alighted on his 1976 soundtrack to French wildlife documentary La Fete Sauvage). The rest of his back catalogue was creatively plundered in hip-hop circles: by Outkast, Jay-Z, Company Flow and, again and again, by J Dilla. In addition, Aphrodite’s Child had also been rediscovered by younger artists. If you grew up with their frontman as the kaftan-clad butt of a joke in Abigail’s Party, belatedly hearing 666 – and particularly its standout track, The Four Horsemen – was a stunning experience: who knew that Demis Roussos had once made music this experimental, this cool? The Four Horsemen earned the distinction of being effectively rewritten twice – first by the Verve on 1997’s The Rolling People, which tipped the wink to those in the know by taking its title from the lyrics of 666’s Altamont, and then by Beck on 2008’s Chemtrails – as well as being subjected to a cover version by Euro-techno titans Scooter. Elsewhere, the album’s tracks were borrowed by both Oneohtrix Point Never and Dan the Automator and, perhaps inevitably given its title and subject matter, found favour with black metal bands. So Vangelis Papathenassiou ended up not just a garlanded soundtrack composer, the go-to guy if you needed something stirring and epic for a major event, an electronic music pioneer and the driving force behind Greece’s most influential rock band – but the thread that improbably linked Rotting Christ, Donna Summer, Boards of Canada, Jay-Z and the Verve. It wasn’t what he set out to do, but as musical legacies go, it’s a suitably unique achievement.",Arts/Music,Vangelis wasn’t just a film composer – he blew apart the boundaries of pop | Alexis Petridis,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/20/vangelis-film-composer-pop-music
5/20/2022,"The leaked contents of a WhatsApp chat group associated with Germany’s far-right AfD has offered an unfiltered glimpse into party discussions, including fantasies over the imprisonment of Angela Merkel, homophobic attacks and armed resistance. Called the Quasselgruppe, or “yakking group”, the chat contains conversations between 76 of the 92 Alternative für Deutschland MPs who entered parliament in 2017 for the first time following the federal election. It contains about 40,000 posts sent from 2017 to 2021 and was passed on by an anonymous AfD member last summer to journalists from the broadcasters NDR and WDR who were making a documentary about the party. The discussions focus on topics including the US presidential election, the pandemic and how the aggressively nationalistic AfD should position itself with regards to the Querdenker movement, a coronavirus denial group. It also touches on other events that deeply shocked the political world in Germany, such as the storming of the Reichstag building in September 2020 by demonstrators protesting against coronavirus safety measures who were assisted by AfD members, and the constitutional crisis, also in 2020, triggered by the collaboration between the AfD and the CDU that enabled the election of a state premier in Thuringia. Also discussed are the homophobic attacks on the former health minister Jens Spahn, and the SPD MP Johannes Kahrs. There are calls for regime change, reflecting some of the language widely heard among anti-Merkel street protests in some parts of eastern Germany, with one calling for the “old regime” to be brought to an end, predicting a “ruthless battle” for which it would be necessary to arm. On Merkel, then chancellor, one post read: “This traitor deserves to be sent to prison until the end of her life.” Indications of internal party disagreements are rife. There is criticism about the party leadership’s failure to not have “pulled the plug” sooner on its radical wing, known as “der Flügel” or wing, due largely to the bad publicity it brought. Parliamentary leaders Alice Weidel, Alexander Gauland and Tino Chrupulla are accused repeatedly in the chat of having weak strategies and of failing to boost the party’s profile. There is also much disgruntlement over the AfD’s failure to make its mark in parliament, with some MPs referring to their own parliamentary faction as a “chaos outfit”. Weidel was reported to have lost her temper at a meeting of parliamentary colleagues when news of the leaks came to light, asking them how it was that the internal communications had been made public. She told the makers of the documentary that she had not been part of the group, that she distanced herself from the remarks and had become accustomed to calls to oust her. After the party was made aware of the leak, internal discussions led the party to switch to communicating on Telegram instead.

5/20/2022,"Boris Johnson has shaken up his No 10 operation in response to criticism of its oversight in the interim Sue Gray report, with new powers handed to the civil service chief Samantha Jones. The new structure puts Jones, the interim permanent secretary at No 10, in charge of key units on national security and legislation, in addition to her existing portfolio. Johnson’s deputy spokesperson said the reorganisation had been carried out after failings were identified in Gray’s initial report, which was critical of the culture that had allowed parties to take place in No 10 during lockdown. The interim report, published in January, said there were “failures of leadership and judgment” that had allowed rule-breaking gatherings to take place in No 10. Her full report is expected in about a week’s time. Johnson is among people to have been given a gist of what the report will say about him, with those contacted by the inquiry team given a few days to respond. Gray is said to be keen to name senior civil servants, but no decisions have been taken on how many and who will feature, or whether the report will contain any photos. Johnson denied that No 10 would try to block names being released, saying it was entirely up to Gray who to identify in her report. “I am looking forward very much to seeing what she has to say and fingers crossed that will be pretty soon next week,” Johnson told Sky News. The restructure came on the day that Scotland Yard’s Operation Hillman ended after issuing 126 fixed penalties to 83 people. No 10 confirmed that only one fine was handed out to the prime minister, for attending a party in honour of his birthday in June 2020 when indoor mixing was banned. Under the shake-up, the government announced changes that will “enhance the support that is offered to the prime minister and to the cabinet”. The Cabinet Office will be split into two, with domestic policy oversight, national security and legislative units handed to No 10 under Jones. The remaining Cabinet Office functions including Whitehall reform and civil service administration will remain under the Cabinet Office permanent secretary, Alex Chisholm. A government spokesperson said: “As we set out earlier in the year, steps are being taken to further strengthen the operation of both No 10 and the Cabinet Office so they are best placed to deliver for the public now and in the future. Work to deliver these plans is ongoing.” Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory MP and former party leader, said Johnson “lost control of what was happening in Downing Street” during the pandemic, after an “awful lot of civil servants” were “caught up” in the Met investigation. He told BBC Radio 4’s PM programme: “They blurred the line very distinctly about what was work and what was not work, and they shouldn’t have done it and they have been fined, a large number of them, and that is quite right.” There is anger within the civil service about how the Partygate saga has ended up with many junior officials getting fines and more senior staff seeming to have avoided blame.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson shakes up No 10 operation after Sue Gray criticism,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/20/boris-johnson-shakes-up-no-10-operation-sue-gray-criticism-samantha-jones
5/20/2022,"Jeff Bezos is getting nervous. You can tell because he’s going on Twitter more, the universal activity of those who are channeling their restlessness in an unhealthy way. This should make the rest of us nervous, too. This is a big, flashing warning sign that America’s richest union-buster is about to throw himself more forcefully into politics – an inevitability that could have many bad outcomes, but only one good one. For the past week, the centi-billionaire Amazon founder has been firing off tweets not about his typical, anodyne interests – improved penis-shaped rocket design, luxury head wax – but rather about his policy opinions. Though Bezos (or whichever PR drone drafts his tweets) writes with the bloodlessness of a man who has attended too many management consulting meetings, it is easy to imagine the seething anger that must have been present in order to prompt him to produce them in the first place. On May 13, he criticized one of Joe Biden’s economic pronouncements, tweeting that “Raising corp taxes is fine to discuss. Taming inflation is critical to discuss. Mushing them together is just misdirection.” He followed that up with another, saying “the administration tried hard to inject even more stimulus into an already over-heated, inflationary economy and only Manchin saved them from themselves. Inflation is a regressive tax that most hurts the least affluent.” On Monday, he again railed against the failed Democratic stimulus bills, saying they would have added to inflation. It would be too easy to point out here that, actually, union-busting is a tax that most hurts the least affluent, or to point out that Bezos could mitigate inflation’s damage by giving his own employees a raise. The notable thing here is not that the staggeringly wealthy executive chairman of one of the world’s most powerful companies would bristle at talk of raising corporate taxes, or that he would bemoan the pandemic-era stimulus packages that saved millions of Americans from total economic disaster. For Amazon, which depends on the existence of a nationwide standing army of desperate people who are willing to take unstable, low-wage warehouse and delivery jobs, the sales benefits of all of that stimulus money have been mitigated by what it has done to the labor market. As demand for employees has soared, it has become harder to hire people; and, more importantly, it has helped to embolden workers to the degree necessary to vote for a union, as Amazon warehouse workers did in Staten Island last month. Like Walmart and every other low-margin retail megacorp whose profits are dependent on total control of an infinite, compliant workforce, Amazon believes that unions are an existential threat. The economic conditions created in part by government stimulus programs have momentarily made things more conducive to organized labor, and therefore, must be crushed, reversed, and judged as historic mistakes, so that policymakers don’t go thinking about doing such a thing again. Of course Bezos believes all this. Duh. We knew he was a rat-bastard union-busting ultra-rich guy many years ago. The fact that he is flying his dumb Twitter flag like a bargain-basement Elon Musk is not really worth getting exercised about. What is distressing is what this signals about Bezos’s future plans. Because when an unaccountable rich business guy starts suddenly putting himself out in the world as a Public Policy Thinker, you can be sure that he is about to start seriously leaning into the world of political influence. And that means that we are now threatened by the very real possibility that Bezos is about to make himself the next, even richer Mike Bloomberg – something that could have devastating effects on the weak-willed functionaries of the already pathetic Democratic party. Though Bezos is certainly an economic Republican, it is hard to imagine him placing his political bets on being a Republican, if only because of what it would mean for his social life. No, if he decides that he must really jump into politics – to protect his own interests, and due to the classic rich-guy belief that nobody poorer than himself should be in charge – he is bound to use the Democratic party as his tool. He could, if he got annoyed enough, flood the party with so much incoming money that the entire “centrist” wing would crawl to his doorstep on its knees, begging to write any bill he wants. The big-picture impact would be to add a huge weight to the neoliberal side of the party’s scale, a powerful force trying to tilt the party away from its recent tiptoes towards progressivism, and towards the vision of the Democrats as the sober new corporate-friendly counterweight to the psycho Maga capture of the Republicans. Last month, Bernie Sanders sent a letter to Joe Biden calling on him to stop giving federal contracts to companies that break federal labor law, especially via illegal union-busting. That simple move could take billions of dollars away from Amazon, which – in the eyes of a labor-friendly NLRB, at least – is guilty of a lot of illegal union-busting. (Amazon disputes this.) It is also a great example of what could be the new vision of the Democrats: not the slick operators trying to arbitrage corporate campaign donations, but rather the party of labor, the party ready to take seriously its own rhetoric about the dangers of rising economic inequality. The Democratic response to the rise of crazies on the right does not need to be to simply try to woo Republican donors away; instead, the Democrats can become the actual populists, the ones who side with working people against the power of capital. (The Republican version of populism, which mostly means “being prepared to wear a John Deere ballcap while you say racist things”, pales in comparison.) Look, I love to see one of the world’s richest men spending his precious time whining on Twitter. That’s time that he’s not union-busting or coming up with aggressive new algorithms to monetize our lives, and besides, I know that time spent on Twitter will make him miserable, which I support. But I am here to warn you that this is a very bad omen. The last thing we need is Jeff Bezos transforming himself into the Democratic party’s biggest power-broker.

5/20/2022,"Long a safe space where conservatives could say what they really thought, this year the Conservative Political Action Conference (Cpac) is hosting an event in Budapest, its first ever on the European continent. Attendees will be treated to panels about “western civilization under attack” and be addressed by American conservative luminaries including the former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows and media figures like Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens. That Hungary has become an authoritarian state whose leader, Viktor Orbán, has deconstructed Hungarian democracy and become a close ally of Vladimir Putin doesn’t seem to faze anyone involved. In fact, it’s the whole point. The embrace of Orbán as a role model by many on the right seems at first glance puzzling. After all, conservatives are not known for welcoming lessons from Europeans on how America ought to be run. But it becomes more explicable when you realize that for years, Orbán has been playing out the fantasies of Cpac’s attendees, unconstrained by the independent institutions, impartial media and racial diversity which American conservatives see as their foils at home. Where Orbán has gone, American conservatives want to follow. And increasingly, they are doing so. Central to Orbán’s appeal is that he is a fighter who has turned his country into, according to the organizers of Cpac, “one of the engines of Conservative resistance to the woke revolution”. In some ways Orbán resembles Trump, but in the eyes of many conservatives he’s better understood as the man they wished Trump would be. Where Trump was a thrice-married playboy who boasted of sleeping with porn stars and managed to lose the 2020 election, Orbán seems both genuinely committed to upholding conservative cultural values and has grimly consolidated control over his country, excluding the left from power indefinitely. Among the terrifying implications of the American right’s embrace of Orbán is that it shows that the right would be willing to dismantle American democracy in exchange for cultural and racial hegemony. Many of Orbán’s admirers come from the “post-liberal right”, a group of intellectuals and politicians who see “traditional American culture” as so far degenerated that it may be necessary to wrest power away from a corrupted people in order to make America great again. They count among Orbán’s victories his clampdown on gay and transgender rights and his refusal to allow Muslim refugees to enter Hungary. Upholding a particular set of “Christian” (actually nationalistic and bigoted) values is seen as worth the damage to democracy – the latter might even be necessary for the former. Things get even more sinister when we consider that America is a vast continent-sized country of enormous cultural and racial diversity. Imposing a conservative monoculture on such a country could only be achieved through one means – governmental coercion. The desirability of doing just that is now openly discussed on the right. Over the past several years, many have been advocating “common-good constitutionalism” – an idea put forward by the conservative legal thinker Adrian Vermeule which holds that America should embrace a new interpretation of the constitution focused on, among other things, a “respect for hierarchy” and a willingness to “legislate morality”. As surely as such ideas underpinned the Jim Crow south, such ideas mesh easily with, indeed are required by, any attempt to bring Orbánism to the United States as a whole. Far from being limited to the trolls at Cpac or obscure writers, such an approach to governing is already being implemented by conservatives up and down the country. State laws which ban teaching about race or gender issues in schools have passed in many states, and Republicans have continued their assault on businesses which speak out on these issues. In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis has moved to use the power of the state to punish Disney for its stance on gay rights. In the face of cultural change which conservatives dislike, the principle of free speech has gone out of the window, and the heavy hand of the state is knocking at the door. The recently leaked US supreme court decision overturning Roe v Wade is perhaps the clearest indication of the danger that this trend poses. By removing a fundamental individual right and once again enabling conservatives to impose their own moral views on women’s bodies, the decision – if passed as written – will be seen on the right as a landmark in how the power of the state can be used to discipline a degenerated culture and regulate morality. Further crackdowns are sure to follow. Locked out of power on the supreme court and facing steep challenges to winning power in America’s unbalanced electoral system, defenders of liberalism will struggle to fight back. It’s no exaggeration to say that Orbánism, with its rejection of democracy and its willingness to use coercion to enforce a narrow cultural and religious agenda, defines the danger posed by modern American conservatism. The danger is greatest when the two elements come together. Unable to win the approval of the people on whom they wish to force their values, conservatives will be tempted to proceed further and further down an undemocratic path. That path has already taken them all the way to Budapest. The fear now is that they will ultimately bring Budapest back to America.

5/20/2022,"The fertility watchdog is considering whether to recommend scrapping anonymity for future sperm and egg donors as part of an expected overhaul of UK fertility laws. Peter Thompson, the chief executive of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), said the rapid rise of consumer genetic testing websites such as 23andMe could soon make it impossible to guarantee donor anonymity – and that the law needs to be brought into line with this new reality. Under rules in place since 2005, people conceived using donated eggs, sperm or embryos can access identifying information about the donor when they reach the age of 18, but donors can choose to remain anonymous until then. “We feel that the technology of cheap DNA tests throws into question the underlying assumption [of anonymity],” said Thompson. “Given that, the responsible thing to do is to start a conversation about where we as a society want to go on these things. It’s a big change.” He added: “You can see a position in the future where confidentiality just becomes impossible, whatever the attitude of families, the honest truth is that people will just find out.” Lifting anonymity from birth would pave the way for the possibility of more contact between donors, donor-conceived people and their parents, and such a proposal would be likely to spark intensive debate. The HFEA is seeking far-reaching changes to the 1990 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act that governs the fertility sector and, after a consultation, is planning to propose draft legislation by the end of the year. The regulator is expected to demand greater powers to fine fertility clinics found selling ineffective “add-on” treatments and wants to make it easier for same-sex and single couples to access treatment. It will also review experimental scientific techniques that could benefit patients in future but would not be legal under current laws. The government will decide whether to pursue new legislation and any recommendations. Thompson said the HFEA had not settled on a proposal around anonymity. One option under consideration is “a presumption of openness almost from the word go”, with the anonymity of donors being lifted at birth rather than at 18. “Given the trend, I can’t see how the existing legal framework is going to cope with the way things are going,” he said. When asked if shortening or removing the period of anonymity could deter donors, Thompson said this concern proved unfounded when rules around anonymity changed in 2005, with donations dipping briefly and then recovering. “There’s no hard evidence that you would lose donors,” he said. Egg and sperm donations have been on a broadly upward trend over the past decade and make up about 20% of IVF treatment cycles. Before 2005, donors could opt for lifelong anonymity, but an increasing number are being identified. Louise McLoughlin, a 30-year-old journalist based in London, found her half-sister, Jess, two and a half years ago after signing up to 23andMe – both were conceived with the same sperm donor. The sites allow users to “match” and make contact with genetic relatives on their databases. The pair were able to identify their biological father because his cousin in Canada had signed up to the site. “He was very unwittingly thrown into this,” said McLoughlin. She has since met her biological father and says they have developed a bond. “I grew up with two parents and I really do think of the man who raised me as my dad,” she said. “I think of my biological father as a bit of a crazy uncle figure.” McLoughlin, who hosts a podcast on the subject of donor conception, believes the law should be revised as she says being given access to information at 18 feels “arbitrary and cruel”. She also regrets not being able to know her half-sister earlier. “The fertility industry is creating people, not children, and we have the right to know any and all genetic history,” she said. Others feel differently. Chlöe Woodmansterne, 29, from St Albans, was donor conceived in 1992 when anonymity was still in place, and has no desire to find her donor or any half-siblings. She questions the need for changes to the law. “I wonder if it wouldn’t be a little confusing for a younger child to have access to that information,” she said. “To have access to a donor to be able to almost leverage that relationship against your own parents could be a bit difficult I think.” Sarah Norcross, the director of the fertility and genomics charity Progress Educational Trust, said any change to anonymity rules would raise complex questions, including about which stage in the process a donor would be identifiable and whether this would become part of the process of choosing a donor. “Making donors mandatorily identifiable earlier in the process may cause more problems than the HFEA hopes to solve,” she said. “Donors, recipients of donation and donor-conceived people are all diverse groups, with varying preferences and perspectives. It is good to allow for a diversity of donor conception arrangements, rather than imposing one model upon everyone. Any proposed change to the law needs to be very carefully thought through.” Prof Turi King, an expert in public engagement and genetics at the University of Leicester, said changing the rules around anonymity “doesn’t seem a crazy idea” as long as people were supported through the process.",News/Society,UK fertility watchdog could recommend scrapping donor anonymity law,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/20/uk-fertility-watchdog-could-recommend-scrapping-donor-anonymity-law
5/20/2022,"The faint purple lines are on the map. The safety plans are approved. The Queen has visited. And just before 6.30am next Tuesday, the gates will finally open to millions of passengers. After decades of planning, 13 years of construction and nearly £20bn spent, Crossrail’s Elizabeth line services are ready to roll. This is still not the finished deal. But its crucial, magnificent core will now be open: the 13 miles of tunnels bored under central London, nine brand new cavernous stations, and digitally controlled trains offering space and speed that underground passengers have never yet enjoyed. Over the last three years, as construction delays and overspending exposed the hubristic boasts of Crossrail bosses, talk of a British engineering triumph has been muted. Now, though, it is time to marvel again. “These stations are like cathedrals. These trains are the longest we’ve seen in London,” says Sadiq Khan, the capital’s mayor. “It is world-leading, world-class. I challenge anyone who uses the Elizabeth line next week not to have their breath taken away – it’s just mind-blowing.” The 205-metre trains, with level boarding for wheelchairs or buggies and no neck-cricking doors, will each carry up to 1,500 people and run every five minutes to begin with, halving the journey time on existing routes to cross London. Andy Byford, the Transport for London commissioner, had pledged to open the line by mid-2022 when inheriting the project in 2020. But, he admits, given the potent symbolism for the Elizabeth line – and with Crossrail having stood up the monarch once already in 2018: “We sweated blood to get it open before the jubilee.” The Elizabeth line will for the first few months run as three separate railways, with passengers on what were formerly called TfL Rail services to the west or east still needing to change at Paddington or Liverpool Street stations. When overground, Crossrail runs on different signalling systems on each side – an engineering complexity partially blamed for the cost overruns and delays. The staged opening means that this Tuesday, while the line will speed and enhance the journey of passengers in the centre, only those living near the three new stations in south-east London – Custom House, Woolwich and Abbey Wood – will experience Crossrail’s full transformative effect: now directly linked to Canary Wharf and the heart of the city, slashing journey times. For most, the “real prize” of Crossrail, as Byford puts it, will arrive this autumn, when direct trains from east or west can run straight across the centre. Passengers who now combine sporadic overground trains and the Tube will instead take seamless trips from well beyond the suburbs to stations on the far side of the City or West End. That, as the prime minister said this week, should be a huge incentive to lure back commuters – critical to revive the capital, and its Covid-battered finances. “What really turns on the revenue stream is getting those through east-west services running,” says Byford. House prices have more than doubled in a decade around Crossrail stations east and west, outstripping the London rise of 55%, according to Rightmove data. Khan stresses that it has also “already led to tens of thousand of jobs, tens of thousands of homes. Two-thirds of this line is in London, two-thirds of it has been paid for by London – and it’s a good example of investment in London benefiting the country.” Much of the spending has been around the UK, such as the £1bn train contract for Derby – but the rest of the country doubtless would prefer direct transport investment, as the government is acutely aware. Nonetheless, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, this week reiterated forecasts that the line would boost the UK economy by £42bn, saying: “We can deliver big infrastructure projects in this country, and the world is going to be very impressed.” For a while, though, Crossrail had looked like a debacle. Just months before it was due to be opened by the Queen in December 2018, bosses who had continued to parrot an “on time and on budget” mantra admitted work was wildly off target. Few outside the scheme had an inkling. Caroline Pidgeon, who as co-chair of the London assembly transport committee since 2008 scrutinised the project more than most, says: “It’s fantastic – but we can’t forget that it is years late and £4bn over budget. The chief executive was saying it was on time and on budget – while the key rep [the independent project representative], was warning of issues. But people just ignored the expert. “We’ve got to learn from this for HS2. How are you building in the proper checks to ensure that public money is being spent well and that work is progressing on time?” The finished Elizabeth line is, though, “another level”, she says – not least in being fully accessible, with step-free access at every station. “It sets the bar even higher for future work.” Christian Wolmar, the author of Crossrail: The Whole Story, agrees: “It is gamechanging in the same way the Metropolitan railway was in 1863, the first underground line. This is the difference between the M1 and a dual carriageway.” The Parisian RER that inspired it is “nothing compared to this”, Wolmar adds. “It will stand the test of time, and be providing an amazing service long after we’ve all popped our clogs.”",News/UK news,‘These stations are like cathedrals’: Elizabeth line services are ready to roll,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/20/elizabeth-line-services-ready-to-roll-crossrail
