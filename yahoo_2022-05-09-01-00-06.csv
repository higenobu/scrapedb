5/9/2022,"Lifetime / Via giphy.com ""'Suspicious vehicle, driving very slow around the neighborhood, making notes at certain houses.' It didn't take long before she stopped being the HOA busybody. I saw her pulled over one day, so I knew the message got through."" —u/delorean623 —u/memon17 ""I was laid up in the house all day, and I get a knock at the door. It's the neighbor woman. Apparently there's a rule that you cannot store a trailer in the driveway for more than three days, and this was day four. I needed to remove it by the end of the day or face a $500 fine. She handed me a paper listing the rule, and I considered just paying the fine, but instead I angrily drove an hour each way to return my dad's trailer. What struck me as odd was there was a list of things you couldn't store in your driveway: personal watercraft, boats, trailers, etc. The odd part was that motorcycle was listed on there. I don't ride one myself, but I thought it was a totally reasonable thing to keep in a driveway. A year or so later, the HOA lady had started dating an older gentleman, and he had moved in with her. Turns out he rode a Harley which was always parked in her driveway. She was home, so I walked over there and politely informed her about the violation. The next day, the motorcycle was parked on her new back porch, the one she bragged about to everyone who would listen so she could tell them how much it cost. I laughed to myself, but then I remembered the part about it needing to be behind a fence. Another knock at the door, and within a few days, a fence company was building a six foot privacy fence which completely hid her fancy new deck."" —u/swyts This evening I get a knock on the door. I look outside and see a woman walking away with two little dogs. One of the dogs stops and proceeds to shit on my cousin's lawn. I wait until the dog is done and open the door. By this time, the woman is beginning to walk away but she sees me and turns around. She introduces herself as a board member of the HOA. Without taking a breath she launches into a lecture about the trailer parked out front, how she's 'lucky to have walked by and caught this egregious violation of the HOA rules' and how the trailer is an 'eyesore on the neighborhood.' She says she won't report me to the board and suggest a fine if I remove it immediately. I calmly inform her about the patio construction and how the crew needs to store their tools and materials at night, but she's absolutely foaming at the mouth about how 'tacky' it is to have a trailer in front of the house. I calmly inform her that I am not the homeowner, nor the owner of the trailer and there isn't much I can do about it (especially at 6:30 p.m. on a Friday night). Nevertheless, she's adamant that I do SOMETHING. By this point I'm fed up with this woman, who obviously has nothing better to do with her evening than bother her neighbors with bullshit. I look at her and casually ask, 'Just out of curiosity, what's the fine for not picking up after your dog if it shits in someone's lawn?' I tell ya, the look on her face at that point was classic. She stuttered for a minute before telling me she would 'have to look into that…' I told her I'd be grateful if she did because my cousin has been suspecting a neighbor of letting their dog poop in his lawn, so he set up a video camera in the window to catch the culprit. Upon hearing that, she got a little flustered and told me to tell the patio crew to hurry up, then she walked away with a huff. A small victory to be sure, but quite satisfying nevertheless."" —u/coulterpatton ""Apparently it was not all good as we received another letter stating the complaints had continued. I should note, we had just moved in not that long ago, and hadn't landscaped the back yet so were letting our dogs pee on the front at night, which lead to the inevitable patches of bright green grass that grow stupid fast. It was in perfectly good shape outside some green spots in an otherwise average looking yard and I do my best to keep things mowed and looking decent. Turns our grumpy neighbor had taken real offense to this and started complaining to the HOA. While the HOA agreed this was not her business and definitely not theirs, I decided she was right and we should stop letting our dogs out in the front to pee. Now, I put them on the leash and let them do their business in her yard. And I'm clearly not the only one as her entire yard is now COVERED in pee spots. I'm pretty sure she's complained about everyone with a dog, and now the entire neighborhood takes their dogs to her yard. The best part, she actually does a shit job taking care of her lawn — weeds and crab grass everywhere. So today I got to report her to the HOA for her yard looking like total shit. If it were any other house (there are much worse) I wouldn't care at all, but this lady wanted lawns without spots so I'm just doing my part to enforce her rules."" —u/strongabbreviations5 ""After weeks of arguing I had to literally pick up my 3,000 pound redwood gazebo and move it three more feet from the wall. Next, I get letters complaining about the vegetation in my front yard. I decided that I'm going to remove my tree and replace it. I also want to remove five plants. One of them is clearly dead by now. Their paperwork specifically says that I have to submit ONE item per design change request. So I submitted seven different requests. One for each plant. One for tree removal. One for tree installation. Now they're sending me generic copy-paste replies saying I can change the yard. None of them specify what design change was approved. I just keep replying to all of them asking for clarification. The last one I got said 'it' was for the tree removal and planting of a new tree... but it didn't include the original letter or even a reference number. So I just replied back that I would like the specific letter included in the email so I can have an approval paper trail. They burned me bad with the gazebo incident. I won't get burned again and I'm having a grand time wasting as much of their time as possible. I smile every time I reply to an email asking for specific information."" —u/useless_skin ""Joan sent them a very threatening letter about their 'unlawful renter' and how fines would accrue if the 'unlawful renter' didn't vacate immediately. It was accompanied with a copy of that part of the bylaws and pictures of Liz's elderly mother taken through windows of their house. Creep alert! They wrote back that there was no renter and explained the situation. Joan did not believe that 'story' and had the HOA lawyer start sending them certified letters about their continued violations with ever increasing fines. After many increasingly aggressive back and forths, it all culminated in an association meeting where Liz, Dave and Liz's mother came in with ID and birth certificates, and basically made Joan look like a pimple on the backside of humanity. They won, but Joan was furious, and swore she'd get them for something.  Cut to the following fall. Liz and Dave needed to repaint the house after making some siding repairs. They carefully checked the bylaws for approved paint colors and picked out a fairly bland shade of something between brown and tan. They gave the painters the color info listed in the bylaws and painting happened. Less than a week after their house was painted, they got another certified letter from the HOA lawyer stating their house was the wrong color. It turned out the approved color and the swatches on file with the board no longer matched because the manufacturer had changed the colors in their line slightly due to some kind of formula change. Joan was out for blood after the 'unlawful renter' and forced them to have to repaint. Liz and Dave were taking no chances on the second try. They got the swatch set from the HOA. For some reason, it made no distinction between approved accent colors (most houses in the neighborhood had brightly colored doors) or house colors. They decided that if they had to paint their house a second time, Joan, the dog that caught the car, could live next to the most garish option they had. It was pumpkin orange. The painters asked multiple times if they were sure. They were very sure. You couldn't see the orange from inside, but you sure could from next door! Joan made many attempts to object to this, but it was within the letter of the HOA rules, and the house stayed orange until long after I moved away."" —u/sunnykl ""On Friday I get a letter from the HOA stating that I am in violation of the restriction and could be fined. Okay, fair enough, they are correct on this one. I then noticed that the date of observation was on Wednesday. I called and said that couldn't be true because I took it down on Monday. Instead of admitting her mistake, she lied and said that she had seen it up on Wednesday. Now I was mad. I printed off a schedule of every sporting event the Bulldogs had in every sport, even club sports and then proceeded to fly the flag every single day there was any kind of game, match, regatta, etc., which was almost every single day. I then started getting letters stating I was in violation again. I would call on each one and explain that the water polo team had a match, or the rowing team had a regatta on those days. After about a month or two of this back and forth, they finally gave up."" —u/viking042900 ""By the time my mother received the letter, the mess had been put away, but they decided to get her on a few other complaints such as the bikes against the side of the house and the 'patchy' gravel. She had two weeks to have everything up to standards. Petty and easily frustrated, my mother knew immediately who called since the couple had come over and told her flat out with their renovations they were selling that house for 'way more any other house and this neighborhood' and would appreciate if she respected that by keeping her property on par. For the next two weeks, every box from that garage was in our driveway. The couch and the living room TV came next. This was early summer, so it was perfect weather to sit in your yard in your short shorts and sports bra. My mom made sure to wave and smile every time they brought someone over for a showing."" —u/jumboface ""The theme he chose was Christmas in Paradise, he sold it to the association by saying it would be bright colors to off-set the dreary winter we were having. They enthusiastically approved it; they had no idea. He found some plastic palm trees, borrowed nine of a friend's pink flamingos, and built a sled for Santa. The flamingos had reindeer antlers and the one in front had a red nose stuck on. The reigns for his flamingos were lights not bells. He also had lights on the house, fake palms, and a sign that said Christmas in Paradise. The HOA couldn't do anything."" —u/naranghim ""The street parking rule is just the beginning of a long list of restrictions including one warranting a hefty fine for 'leaving the garage door open when not in use.' This came as a huge surprise since several of my neighbors have parked their cars on the street without problems since I've lived here, so I assumed it was okay. I can only imagine that they've singled me out because my car is 30 years old, however, in my defense, it's very presentable and by no means junky. Being singled out made me incredibly frustrated to the point where I started doing legal research. It turns out my HOA has every right to tow my project car since it's parked on a private street in the neighborhood. The good news for me is that the street just outside of the neighborhood is public, and it's 100% legal to park on it for any amount of time. Unfortunately for the HOA, the closest section of public street to my rental house is right in front of their nice gated entrance. Ironically, my old BMW has now become part of their image, and there's nothing they can do about it until I move out in a few months."" —u/wrassehole ""When they passed this rule, I was livid. I realized that they never mentioned which holidays we could decorate for, so the first thing I did was go out and buy red, white and blue lights. I decorated for the 4th of July and you better believe I left those annoying lights up until July 19th. Problem is there really aren't major holidays from July on until October. BUT the HOA did not say it had to be a major holiday. After July 19th, I decorated for International Beer day which was on August 4th with the same red, white and blue lights up for the 4th of July but I removed the sign that said 'Happy Independence Day' and replaced it with a sign I made myself that read 'Happy International Beer Day.' On August 19th, I changed the sign to Happy National Aviation Day. I kept the same lights up though. Next was Labor Day. Yep. Just changed the sign again. On September 19th, I started celebrating Rosh Hashanah. Because again, they never indicated which holidays we could decorate for. I kept this up over the holidays where I started with Veteran's Day after Halloween and then went to Thanksgiving and Hanukkah. The board met and tried to pass a rule saying which holidays we could decorate for, BUT they couldn't get the vote when they tried to just include New Years, Valentine's Day, 4th of July, Halloween, and Christmas. They didn't include any Jewish Holidays or any other non-Christian holidays like Ramadan and a lot of people voiced their displeasure with that. So they are going to meet again and I think they are just going to change the rule to make decorations come down for the holidays in a reasonable time and not put restrictions on when we can start."" —u/jaxmagicman ""I call in and ask why I got the notice. The full description says, 'Bins in driveway with lids off.' I asked if this happen to be a Tuesday, and sure enough it was. Wednesday is pickup, and I was doing my weekly cleaning. I was fucking using them, I calmly explained through gritted teeth. 'Oh okay, I’ll remove the notice.' Great, but how do I prevent this from happening again? 'Oh, uh....I guess notify us.'  'Alright', I said, 'I’ll notify you every time I’m using my trash cans.'  'Oh that won’t be necessary....' Clearly it is. That was five Tuesdays ago. Today, I once again called promptly at ten o’clock and let Alan know I was about to use my trash cans. 'You know what? I’m just going to put a hold on any trash can notices for you.' Hey that would be swell, Alan. That would be swell."" —u/endoman13 ""So he checked the by laws further and found that while it was stated that all exposed walls must be painted, there was absolutely no mention of any color restrictions. By the time he was done each plank was a different primary color and there was nothing they could do about it. They were furious with him and he laughed his ass off."" —u/procrastinator3000v2 ""Here's where the malicious compliance comes in. In our neighborhood, the roads are public, not private. We did a bit of research and found out that in our area, on public roads, a vehicle can be parked for one WEEK before it needs to move. So, we do the reasonable thing and park our huge RV in front of the house of the head of our HOA. For a week. And then we move it a few dozen feet, and leave it another week. And then go on our trip. We never heard about it from the HOA, presumably because they realized they have no control on public streets. After that, they stopped complaining when our RV was in the driveway for a few days every couple months."" —u/the-42nd-doctor Note: Comments have been edited for length and clarity.

5/9/2022,"A New Jersey couple was kicked off a JetBlue flight and escorted out of the airport last Sunday, per reports. A viral video shows the couple using a homophobic slur and ranting at flight attendants and passengers. In the footage, the couple claims they are being kicked off for supporting former President Donald Trump. A New Jersey couple was kicked off a JetBlue flight last Sunday after hurling a homophobic slur at passengers and ranting about everything from China to Elon Musk, according to reports. The woman, identified by the Daily Beast as former Broadway dancer Madeleine Kelly, was escorted off the flight with her husband — known only as ""Gene."" The couple, who described themselves in the video as Trump supporters, was then removed from West Palm Beach airport by law enforcement officers on Sunday afternoon, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office, per the Daily Beast. Video footage of the incident, shared on TikTok and Reddit, shows Kelly gesticulating as she confronts a JetBlue flight attendant. It is unclear what started the heated discussion, but Kelly can be heard ranting to a flight attendant about free speech at the start of the clip. ""You guys see what's happening in America,"" Kelly says in the video. ""He didn't like what he said, and now we're getting kicked off a plane."" She continues, ""You guys, we're going to turn in China. It's coming. Sheep, sheep, sheep, baaah."" Kelly then moves on to the issue of mask-wearing and praising Elon Musk, the video shows. ""Oh, I love Elon Musk. He is the best,"" Kelly says of the Tesla billionaire who recently bought Twitter. ""Elon! He is the fucking king!"" she adds She then threatens to sue a passenger and the airline before mentioning that she used to dance on Broadway. According to a review in The New York Times, Kelly was the director-choreographer of the 2007 musical ""The Glorious Ones."" Kelly's husband can then be heard using the homophobic F-slur, which he repeats several times in the video. In the video, Kelly, who says it's her and Gene's anniversary, can be seen buckling her husband's seatbelt after a flight attendant tries to remove them from the flight. Kelly repeatedly asks why they are being kicked off the plane. ""We've got to get off the plane because we're Trump supporters,"" she says. ""Seriously, I really think that's what it is."" Towards the end of the clip, she tells a passenger, who appears to be recording the incident, to put it on YouTube. No charges were filed against the couple, the Daily Beast said, citing local officials. JetBlue did not respond to Insider's request for comment on Friday morning.

5/9/2022,"By Engen Tham and Eduardo Baptista SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) -Shanghai authorities were tightening the city-wide COVID lockdown they imposed more than a month ago, prolonging into late May an ordeal that China's capital Beijing was desperate to avoid by turning mass testing into an almost daily routine. The commercial hub of 25 million was making a fresh push to bring case numbers outside the areas that were facing the strictest curbs to zero by the second half of May, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The people said movement curbs will generally remain through the month due to fears of a rebound even though case numbers have been falling. Authorities in some districts issued notices ordering people back into their residential compounds after having let them out for brief walks or quick shopping. In a video shared widely on Chinese social media, police in hazmat suits argue with residents who were told they needed to be quarantined after a neighbour tested positive. ""This is so that we can thoroughly remove any positive cases,"" one of the officers is heard saying. ""Stop asking me why, there is no why. We have to adhere to national guidelines."" Reuters was not able to independently verify the video. The Shanghai government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The prolonged isolation and fear of being sent to quarantine centres, which sometimes lack showers and other basic conditions, have caused widespread frustration, even altercations. Videos posted online last week showed dozens of workers at Apple and Tesla supplier Quanta overwhelming hazmat-suited security guards and vaulting over factory gates to escape being trapped inside amid COVID rumours. 'MAGICAL' BEIJING Strict COVID restrictions in Beijing, Shanghai and dozens of other major cities across China are taking a psychological toll on its people, weighing on the world's second-largest economy and disrupting global supply chains and international trade. The measures mark a sharp contrast with most of the world, which is easing or removing COVID curbs to live with the virus even as infections spread. Beijing has closed gyms and entertainment venues, banned dine-in services at restaurants and shut scores of bus routes and almost 15% of its sprawling subway system, while many residents voluntarily avoid going out. ""It is quite strange,"" said a 50-year-old Beijing resident surnamed Ding, as he took a photo of an empty street leading into a closed subway station. ""It is the first time in all my years in Beijing that I see empty streets in the middle of summer. It's magical."" Businesses that remained open were not seeing many clients as people did not want to do anything that might bring them near infected people and force them into quarantine. “North of us are malls and offices that have been sealed, and their apps might mark them as close contacts if they came,"" said a barber surnamed Song, referring to the mobile monitoring software all residents must use. “This outbreak has truly unsettled everyone."" JOB SUPPORT Premier Li Keqiang in a teleconference with other top officials pledged on Saturday to support ""as many employers as possible,"" especially among small and midsize firms, to keep people in their jobs, state media reported. China's jobless rate stood at 5.8% in March, the highest since May 2020, while that in 31 major cities hit a record 6.0%. April's full lockdown of Shanghai and stricter curbs elsewhere have since further pummelled the job market. Despite the costs, Chinese authorities are unwavering in their commitment to stamp out the coronavirus. Last week the authorities threatened action against critics of the zero-COVID policy. Regular testing is set to become a feature of daily life in many cities, as officials hope that could help detect and isolate infections early enough to avoid mass closures and movement curbs. On Sunday, residents lined up for another round of tests in Beijing's Chaoyang, Fangshan and Fengtai districts and small parts of others. In a large Chaoyang compound, two people moved around with loud speakers blaring a repeated message reminding residents to be tested. Many residents, even if not subject to the mass tests, still must show a recent negative result to get to work or enter various venues. Shanghai, which has conducted 63 million PCR tests and 126 million rapid antigen tests last week, will also keep conducting daily screening, city officials said. Shanghai and other cities are also building thousands of permanent PCR testing stations. Beijing's daily COVID cases are in the dozens, much lower than Shanghai's at this point in its outbreak, when infections were in the triple digits and rising. Shanghai's cases fell for a ninth day, Sunday data showed, but remained in the thousands, prompting warnings against complacency from party and city officials.
