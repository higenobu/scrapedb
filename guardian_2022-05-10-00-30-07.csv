5/10/2022,"Nick Cave has announced that his oldest son Jethro has died, aged 31. In a brief statement, he wrote: “With much sadness, I can confirm that my son, Jethro, has passed away. We would be grateful for family privacy at this time.” Jethro Cave was born in 1991 to Nick and mother Beau Lazenby. Nick’s second son Luke was born 10 days after Jethro, to Nick’s first wife Viviane Carneiro; Jethro grew up in Australia and later said he didn’t meet Nick until he was seven or eight years old. “It was a difficult time, but it turned out great in the end,” Nick told a journalist in 2008. “To my eternal regret, I didn’t make much contact with Jethro in the early years, but I now have a great relationship with him.” Jethro said in a 2012 interview: “It didn’t start off that great, having all this shit with my dad and being in his shadow.” After moving to the UK as a young man, Jethro became a model, including for Balenciaga; Hedi Slimane, creative director of Celine, has photographed him. He also started his own music projects. In April, he was found guilty of unlawful assault, after he physically attacked his mother in March. His lawyer announced that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia. He was jailed, and released last weekend. He was previously convicted of assault in 2018, against his then girlfriend. Cave has now suffered the death of two of his four sons, after his son Arthur died aged 15 after falling from a cliff near Brighton. In a statement announcing his death, he was described as a “beautiful, happy, loving boy”, and the impact of his death on Cave was explored in the documentary One More Time With Feeling, which focused on the making of the album Skeleton Tree.",Arts/Music,"Jethro Cave, son of Nick Cave, dies aged 31",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/09/jethro-cave-son-of-nick-cave-dies-aged-31
5/10/2022,"Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, is right to urge the home secretary to relax the “unnecessary, long, bureaucratic” visa scheme (Report, 3 May). Last week I saw first-hand a Polish humanitarian volunteer group at Lviv station bring Ukrainian refugees safely to a Polish coordination centre. They are supported to go to their desired destinations either within Poland or other western countries as though they are simply walking across a humanitarian corridor. Contrast this with the UK debacle for those trying to enter with a visa. While the Poles have gone to incredible efforts to support Ukrainian refugees, they cannot be expected to support everyone and not all refugee centres, and shelters are conducive to physical and mental health. As a sponsor for the UK Homes for Ukraine scheme, part of my trip was to bring back to the UK two refugees who are currently in Warsaw. The applications were jointly completed in March and my DBS and checks on the house were completed within a week by Birmingham city council. Then the waiting begins. The UK delays are simply adding to the psychological trauma for the refugees who have escaped a war zone and chosen the safety of the UK, yet hear virtually nothing for weeks while other Ukrainian refugees are long embedded in new homes across Europe. Priti Patel insists on “vital security checks” on the desperate fleeing women and their young children. However, 140 other countries don’t have the same issue. Now is the time for the government to change its policy, allow visa free access and avoid further shameful delays.Andrew HindleSutton Coldfield, Birmingham  I was interested to read your article (Woman hosting brother’s Ukrainian family left struggling to pay bills, 3 April), because I am experiencing a related difficulty. Since March, my husband and I have been hosting the Ukrainian family of an acquaintance because we had an empty house, and they would otherwise have had to move into the two-bedroom home of their relative – which would have meant nine people sharing that small space. Our guests came in under the Ukrainian family scheme, and we have been trying since then to “opt in” to the Homes for Ukraine scheme to access the £350 payment, which we would use to partly offset their bills. We have been told that there is no means of doing this, as their family has committed to supporting them, but that they are able to claim the full range of benefits that would be available to a British citizen. They are also fully at liberty to seek private rented accommodation if they wish to do so. This situation therefore seems to be that we could go through the rigmarole of charging them rent, and they could then apply for housing benefit – which for a family of their size in the area where they are living would be up to £264.66 per week. If we were to do this it would cost the taxpayer about £700 per month more than if we were in the Homes for Ukraine scheme. The utter perversity of this is very obvious to me, but trying to convince the government either to grant the “thank you” payment within the family scheme or to permit people to switch from one scheme to the other has proved impossible thus far. I hope that Julie Crowther and her family will have more luck in pushing back against this ridiculous and discriminatory approach.Name and address supplied  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

5/10/2022,"Keir Starmer has pledged to resign as Labour leader if he is fined for breaching Covid rules by taking part in a gathering in Durham last year in which he and other party activists ate takeaway food and drank beer during a campaign visit. Starmer said he was determined to prove he had “different principles to the prime minister” who has already been issued with a fixed-penalty notice for breaching lockdown rules in Downing Street. The Labour leader said he was determined to prove no rules were broken. “The idea that I would casually break the rules is wrong. I don’t think those who are accusing me of it believe it themselves … they are trying to say all politicians are the same.” In a statement at Labour HQ, he said: “If the police decide to issue me with a FPN I would of course do the right thing and step down … The British public deserve politicians who think the rules apply to them.” The announcement follows intense speculation about what Starmer might do if Durham police, who last week started a new investigation into the event on 30 April 2021, decide to issue him with a fixed-penalty notice. He called on both Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak to step down after the prime minister and chancellor were among those fined for being at a lockdown-breaching impromptu birthday celebration for Johnson in Downing Street in June 2020. Starmer pulled out of a speech at the Institute for Government on Monday, as he wrestled with how to respond to renewed pressure on him over the conduct of aides at the gathering in Durham, with some reported to have been drunk. The growing pressure from the scandal has caused some despair among Labour MPs for preventing the party from capitalising on local election results and key airtime ahead of the Queen’s speech on Tuesday. “We’ve lost hugely valuable time to make our case for what we would be doing in government by cancelling this speech – all because Keir is yet again unable to be bold,” said one MP who counselled in favour of Starmer saying he would be prepared to resign. Mary Foy, the Labour MP for the City of Durham, in whose constituency office the lockdown meal took place, denied the reports on Monday that some staff had been drunk. “These allegations about my staff are untrue,” she said in a statement.",News/Politics,Keir Starmer pledges to resign as Labour leader if fined for Covid breach,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/09/keir-starmer-pledges-resign-labour-leader-if-fined-lockdown-beer-covid-breach

It is a fine example of mid-Victorian civic mock-medieval gothic, but quite inappropriate and inhibiting for a modern democracy.

5/10/2022,"A Texas woman got a bang for her buck when her purchase of a $34.99 marble bust from a Goodwill thrift store turned out to be a relic from ancient Rome. Laura Young, who has been reselling antiques for 11 years, came across a 52lb marble bust in an Austin Goodwill in 2018. “I was just looking for anything that looked interesting,” Young told CNN. She added: “It was a bargain at $35 – there was no reason not to buy it.” After purchasing the bust, Young reached out to various auction houses and experts to find out more about the sculpture. A specialist used a digital database to track down the bust’s provenance and found photos from the 1930s featuring the head in Aschaffenburg in Bavaria, Germany. Sotheby’s eventually confirmed that the bust was estimated to be about 2,000 years old, and came from ancient Rome. Furthermore, the bust likely belonged to Roman military leader Sextus Pompey, according to San Antonio Museum of Art postdoctoral fellow Lynley McAlpine. Pompey’s father was Pompey the Great, a political ally turned enemy of Julius Caesar. The bust was once kept at Pompejanum, a replica of a Pompeii-style Roman home that was commissioned by King Ludwig I and built in the 1840s. Pompejanum displayed the bust until the second world war, when groundskeepers placed the sculpture and other relics in storage as the villa came under attack. For about the next 80 years, the bust’s whereabouts were unknown – until Young dug it up at a Goodwill. “It seems like sometime between when it was put into storage until about 1950, someone found it and took it,” McAlpine told CNN. “Since it ended up in the US it seems likely that some American that was stationed there (during the war) got their hands on it.” Young tried to track down the person who donated the bust through Craigslist but was unsuccessful. “I would really love it if whoever donated it came forward,” she told CNN. “It’s most likely not the original person who took him, but (I) would still like to know the story.” The San Antonio art museum was loaned the bust for a year, but the piece still technically belongs to Germany because it was stolen from storage. Germany anticipates getting the bust back in May of next year and then displaying it once again in the Pompejanum.",News/US news,"Texas woman’s Goodwill find turns out to be 2,000-year-old Roman relic",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/09/texas-woman-goodwill-2000-year-old-roman-relic
5/10/2022,"The proposed reforms of the Mental Health Act (‘Antiquated’ mental health laws in England and Wales set for overhaul, 6 May) are long overdue. The MHA was designed for the detention of people who are mentally unwell and at risk of harm to themselves or others by virtue of a defined mental disorder, to enable them to have treatment. It is scandalous that people with autism and learning disabilities are detained when there is no evidence of mental disorder. The disproportionate number of black people being detained and subject to community treatment orders has been evident for many years, yet the inequities remain, with little evidence of serious change. This remains a shocking indictment of the processes of detention. The involvement of those detained to have a greater say in treatment preferences is welcome. However, without serious attention to the crisis in access to mental health services, the quality of many services and the unsafe staffing levels, the services will be hard pressed to act on these preferences.Patrick CallaghanProf of mental health science, London South Bank University  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

5/10/2022,"Many of us have a never-ending list of tasks that are work-related, but not quite work: writing up minutes from meetings, assembling entries for awards, serving on committees, selecting interns, organising holiday parties, shopping for leaving gifts. Many, if not most working women accept it as just part of the job. But taking one for the team could be holding all women back. A new book argues that “non-promotable work” – the kind that is important to organisational functioning, but unlikely to be rewarded or even recognised – is the invisible hurdle to gender equality in the workplace, with women’s time and energy being disproportionately expended on thankless tasks. “It’s not that women are do-gooders, who want to help out the group,” says Lise Vesterlund, an economics professor at the University of Pittsburgh. “They’re doing it because we’re expecting them to.” Vesterlund and three friends wrote The No Club: Putting a Stop to Women’s Dead-End Work after finding themselves overwhelmed in their own careers a decade ago. “Initially it was about getting our own work lives under control,” she says. Over years of research they found that – across the public and private sectors, and a wide range of roles – female employees were shouldering the burden of “office housework” and low-value assignments, causing them to miss out on promotions and pay increases. “We think this is a central part of why women are not advancing at similar rates to men,” says Vesterlund. From teachers to engineers, investment bankers to checkout clerks, “there is not an industry, occupation or rank that we have looked at where we didn’t see this being a problem”. Their analysis of employee hours at a large consultancy firm found that, regardless of seniority, the median woman spent about 200 more hours on non-promotable work each year than the median man – equating to approximately one month’s worth of dead-end tasks. For junior women, it seemed to come at the expense of meaningful work, with junior men spending about 250 more hours each year on high-value work such as with clients. Senior women, on the other hand, spent the same amount of time on promotable tasks as senior men – meaning they just worked more hours in total. The firm’s executives were “shocked” to learn of the size of the imbalance, says Vesterlund. “The magnitude of this is just so much greater than what organisations expect, which is why we need to spread the word.” The reason for this imbalance is twofold, says Vesterlund: not only are women asked to do this work more often than men; when asked, they are more likely to say yes. “Women feel guilty when they say no – because we expect them to say yes.” One experiment found that, in a mixed-gender group, women were 48% more likely to volunteer to take on a task than men were. (Men volunteered more often when in a group without women.) This collective expectation has been internalised by managers and employees alike, derailing individual careers and entrenching inequality. Vesterlund’s research found that employees with less productive assignments were paid less and found themselves unable to increase their pay through negotiation. “Men are also more strategic in the non-promotable work that they do, selecting the tasks that will get them access and connections,” Vesterlund says. A 2021 report by McKinsey found women to be taking the lead on employee wellbeing and diversity, equity and inclusion – often without thanks, even as such initiatives were trumpeted through the pandemic. “It is clearly seen as being critical work but it is not being rewarded or recognised,” says Vesterlund. In fact, company commitments to equal representation (such as on panels or committees) can pile the responsibility on to just a few individuals, says Vesterlund, with minority ethnic women in particular “taxed” for their underrepresentation. One study of teaching staff at a US university in 2012 found that the academics of colour spent three more hours a week on non-promotable service tasks than their white counterparts, with one respondent noting: “If you are one of two women in your department … [you] go on a lot of dinners.” Combined with domestic responsibilities, not least caring for children and elderly relatives, this personal-pressure pileup is coalescing into a mental health crisis among working women. “The risk … remains very real,” warned the McKinsey report. But Vesterlund and her co-authors argue that, until the problem of non-promotable work is tackled, inequalities will persist. The switch to hybrid working, often presented as increasing flexibility, could in fact worsen the problem by making women less visible. A Deloitte survey found that nearly 60% of those working remotely felt excluded from meetings, while 45% said they did not have enough exposure to leaders. Vesterlund says the solution is for employers and employees to reflect on how non-promotable tasks are allocated within their organisation so that it can be made fairer. Managers could assign tasks at random or by a rota, split them between multiple employees, or align them with existing responsibilities or skills. “The solution is to change the way we distribute work: once we give men and women equal opportunities to get assignments, many things will fall into place,” says Vesterlund. In the meantime, the challenge is resisting the status quo: “When women are expected to say yes, it can cause backlash when they say no,” says Vesterlund. Men can help to redress the balance by putting themselves forward for non-promotable tasks before a female colleague volunteers, or by taking some off her plate. Meanwhile, women can support each other to protect their time and boundaries, just as Vesterlund and her coauthors started doing a decade ago. Even so, she says: “I continue to be shocked by how easy it is for some of my male colleagues to say no – and how hard it is for me.”  The No Club: Putting a Stop to Women’s Dead-End Work by Linda Babcock, Brenda Peyser, Lise Vesterlund and Laurie R Weingart is published by Piatkus in paperback (£14.99)",News/Society,‘No reward or recognition’: why women should say no to ‘office housework’,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/09/they-feel-guilty-why-women-should-say-no-to-office-housework
5/10/2022,"Watching Manchester City spank their 21st goal in five top-flight games past Newcastle on Sunday afternoon, The Fiver couldn’t shake off the nagging feeling that what the table-toppers are really crying out for is a top-class centre forward. Snark aside, they were certainly crying out for one across both legs of their shambolic Big Cup showing against Real Madrid, when Karim Benzema showed them exactly what they are missing in their ongoing, as-yet-unsuccessful quest for European glory. To the relief of people tasked with writing daily doses of tedious, often incorrect transfer speculation in The Fiver’s gossiping, early-morning and part-time half-sibling The Rumour Mill, it was revealed that City’s bid to bring Erling Haaland to the Etihad is nearing completion and “should be confirmed this week”. With personal terms reported to have already been agreed with Dortmund’s 21-year-old striker, City are expected to pony up the bargain €75m (£64m) required to trigger his release clause in the coming days. Should the deal go through, it will mark a poignant return to the north-west for a young man whose father Alfie famously made his name with City during the club’s church-mouse years, on the back of some extremely ill-advised goading of Roy Keane. Back in those days, Shaun Goater was banging them in and, assuming Haaland keeps knack-free and maintains his phenomenal strike-rate, there’s every chance he could eclipse the Goat in fans’ affections en route to becoming the Ballon d’Or-winning GOAT he seems destined to be. For now, however, City have more pressing personnel concerns in defence, having lost Kyle Walker, John Stones and Ruben Dias to assorted-knack for their three remaining games this season. With Nathan Aké also sidelined for Wednesday’s visit to Wolves, Pep Guardiola is down to the bare bones in central defence and may have to play Rodri, Fernandinho or one of the many talented young defenders from the club’s lavishly funded academy. “In this situation it’s not a problem,” he tooted. “Rodri can play there. We have the academy. Everyone has to do extra. We have problems and that’s all.” Pep was in spiky form on Sunday, taking potshots at pundits such as Dimitar Berbatov and Clarence Seedorf for remarks they made in the wake of City’s Big Cup exit. He also took a pop at the global population at large for wanting Liverpool rather than his side to win shiny pots, in a slightly paranoid fit of pique that will have come as a surprise to the many Liverpool fans out there who firmly believe it is, in fact, their club that is universally unpopular. “The people want Liverpool to win more than us – it’s not an issue,” he cooed, making it an issue. “It’s normal. Maybe they have more supporters all around the world and in England maybe more support Liverpool than us.” While that may be technically true, given Liverpool’s storied history, the fact of the matter is that most fans don’t give a hoot which pots either club wins, not least when there’s far more pressing League One playoff semi-final action to fret over.

5/10/2022,"John Oliver delivered an impassioned episode of his HBO show after the “catastrophic” news that the US is set to overturn the basic right to an abortion. On the latest episode of Last Week Tonight, the host said that “while the fate of Roe might not have been a surprise, the draft itself was still a horror show” referring to Samuel Alito’s leaked draft calling for the 1973 decision to be reversed. Oliver said that “we need to be able to talk about abortion like adults” which means focusing on the “immediate and devastating consequences” that this will have. He referred to it as “catastrophic” as it will quickly trigger bans on abortion in 22 states. He noted that around 25% of women have had an abortion and this reversal is ultimately about “bodily autonomy”. He played a clip from Fox News where a host said that people can just move to a different state if they want an abortion. “It’s not about merely having the right to go somewhere else, it’s also about whether you have the resources and ability to do that and many may not,” he said. Oliver noted that this will affect people with disabilities, those who are transgender, immigrants and people of colour the most. But he stressed that this has been brewing, discussing the fetal heartbeat law that had already been introduced in Texas, showing a clip of a woman who was pregnant for just six weeks and one day and was denied an abortion. “‘For most people that is a period that is two weeks late,” he noted. He said that women live in a “misogynistic theocracy run by five of the biggest weirdos in the country” with the “extremely grim” circumstances leading to “limited options” for many. Republicans have “been advocating for this exact outcome for decades now” with this a “result of decades of work from anti-abortion forces”. Talk of codifying the law hasn’t led to anything while “too many Democratic leaders were squeamish in their defence” of it despite two-thirds of Americans approving. “Presidents can’t even get approval ratings that high unless there are two 9/11s,” he said. While the US is regressing, other countries are expanding rights. “Even Ireland is now more progressive on abortion than some US states,” he said. He added “We need elected officials to stop tiptoeing around the issue of abortion and take steps to properly safeguard it.” There needs to be a constitutional amendment as other issues like voting rights to gay marriage will be under attack. “Under the current supreme court, your basic rights today could become crimes tomorrow,” he said. Republicans “never accepted Roe v Wade as final and they played the long game” and “anti-choice advocates worked really hard for a really long time”. He added: “Freedoms are never guaranteed, they are hard won and easily lost.”",Arts/Television & radio,John Oliver: ‘Your basic rights could become crimes tomorrow’,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/09/john-oliver-abortion-supreme-court-last-week-tonight-recap

Avatar: The Way of Water will bring back stars Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver to continue the story of the Na’vi, a race of extraterrestrial humanoids under attack from humans. New cast-members include Kate Winslet, Michelle Yeoh, Jemaine Clement and Edie Falco. The film will take place predominantly in the ocean, with new technology created to master performance-capture underwater. The original was a cultural and commercial phenomenon on release in 2009, winning three Oscars and becoming the biggest global box office hit of all time, making over $2.8bn. The sequel has been in development ever since and started production in 2017 with the third film being made at the same time. The next two instalments are then set to go into production once post-production on the third film has completed. The strategy poses a huge financial risk to backers Disney with each sequel carrying an estimated $250m budget. “The big issue is: Are we going to make any damn money?” Cameron said to Entertainment Weekly last year. “Big, expensive films have got to make a lot of money. We’re in a new world post-Covid, post-streaming. Maybe those [box office] numbers will never be seen again. Who knows? It’s all a big roll of the dice.” Winslet, who will be reuniting with Cameron for the first time since Titanic, has already gained viral attention for reportedly holding her breath for seven minutes underwater. “When Jim asked me if I would do the films with him, I asked him to describe the character,” she said to Variety. “He said, “Well, she’s basically the female leader of a water tribe. And I immediately said, “YES! YES!” I’m happy with anything to do with water. Then to discover that I had an opportunity to learn how to free dive and breath-hold to play the role. It was incredible.

In other videos of the incident circulating online, anti-war activists can be heard chanting “fascists” and “murderers”. Andreev told the Russian news agency Tass that he and his team had not been seriously hurt in the incident. The protesters prevented the ambassador from laying flowers at the cemetery and Polish police escorted him away. Russia’s foreign ministry responded to the incident by demanding Warsaw organise a new wreath-laying ceremony immediately and saying Poland should “ensure complete protection against any provocations”. The war in Ukraine has overshadowed this year’s Victory Day when Russia remembers the 27 million Soviet citizens who lost their lives in the second world war. Poland, which has taken in millions of Ukrainian refugees, cancelled all official commemorations of the anniversary. Speaking during a trip to Iran, the Polish foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, said: “It is an incident that should not have happened, an incident that is, by all means, regrettable.” He said diplomats enjoyed special protection regardless of the policies pursued by the authorities of their countries. The Polish interior minister, Mariusz Kaminski, tweeted: “The gathering of opponents of Russian aggression against Ukraine, where genocide takes place every day, was legal. The emotions of Ukrainian women participating in the demonstration, whose husbands courageously fight for the defence of the Motherland, are understandable. “The Polish authorities did not recommend the Russian ambassador to lay flowers on 9 May in Warsaw. The police allowed the ambassador to safely leave the scene.” The Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said the “admirers of neo-Nazism have again shown their faces”, repeating Kremlin claims that Russia is fighting fascists in Ukraine. The incident is likely to further raise tensions between Moscow and Warsaw, with Poland emerging as a key arms supply route in the Ukraine war. Russian officials have claimed without evidence that Poland aspires to annex the western regions of Ukraine, and Warsaw refused earlier this month to pay the Russian energy giant Gazprom in roubles, leading to a halt in gas supplies to the country.",News/World news,Russian ambassador to Poland pelted with red paint at VE Day gathering,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/russian-ambassador-to-poland-sergey-andreev-pelted-with-red-paint-at-ve-day-gathering
5/10/2022,"Fifa has confirmed its ethics committee is investigating allegations of sexual abuse and harassment made against one of its refereeing instructors and the Colombian Football Federation’s head of referees. Óscar Julián Ruiz, a Colombian who officiated at the 2002, 2006 and 2010 World Cups and has worked as a Fifa instructor since June 2011, has been accused of sexual harassment by 11 alleged victims and more than 30 witnesses. Imer Machado – the director of the FCF’s referees commission – is also facing claims of sexual abuse and harassment from 14 alleged victims and witnesses. Ruiz, who has strenuously denied the accusations, was investigated in 2019 by the Colombian authorities after facing claims he raped a minor and sexually harassed three fellow referees. That case was “archived” after a judge ruled there was not enough evidence against him. However, a detailed new application for it to be reviewed that has been seen by the Guardian was sent by lawyers on behalf of one of the officials, Harold Perilla, on 7 March. It alleges Ruiz sexually abused and harassed several more referees and some claim he also forced others to have sex with him in order for them to obtain promotion. Machado, another former international referee, has also been accused of sexual abuse and harassment, including claims that he touched another official’s penis and testicles in front of other people. It is understood that Colombia’s attorney general is considering whether to review the case in light of the new evidence. “We have taken note of the information provided in your enquiry and can confirm that the independent Fifa Ethics Committee is currently looking into the matter,” said a Fifa Ethics spokesperson. “Please understand that no further comment can be made at this stage.” The application details claims from Perilla, Carlos Chavez and Julian Mejia that Ruiz repeatedly sexually harassed them during their careers as well as several new allegations, including that he had sex with a male referee who was only 13 at the time. “The facts and evidence show the pattern of sexual harassment behaviour by Ruiz towards Colombian professional soccer referees over several years,” it alleges. “Óscar Julián Ruiz isn’t the only one,” Perilla told the Guardian. “We also have Machado, the director of the referees commission and former international referee. He tried with me too, I filed a complaint and I’m not the only one. Ruiz touched my penis during a preseason. He asked me to have sex with him. That’s how I could get promoted. Machado also touched my penis and even my testicles in front of other people. That’s why I filed the complaint because it’s the same method. In Colombia, unfortunately, most of the people have to give sex to become an international referee.” Ruiz said that “none of the facts are consistent with reality”, adding: “I lasted 16 years as an international referee and was never investigated. I have carried out more than 200 international activities, tournaments, courses, seminars with referee instructors from around the world and I have never been accused.” The FCF did not respond to a request to comment on the claims against Machado.",Sport/Football,Fifa investigating accusations of sexual abuse against refereeing instructor,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/09/fifa-investigate-accusations-sexual-abuse-refereeing-instructor
5/10/2022,"Thousands of passengers have had to queue outside terminals at Birmingham and Manchester airports, and dozens have missed flights, in chaotic scenes underlining the aviation industry’s struggle to return to normal pre-pandemic service. The staff shortages that led to congested terminals at Easter and widespread flight cancellations have persisted, with Birmingham deciding to move passengers outside to disentangle check-ins from security lines. Passengers described the experience as “manic” and “absolute chaos” on social media. One at Manchester, who described himself as a regular flyer, tweeted he had “never seen it this bad” as lines of people stretched outside the airport buildings in the early morning. Airports and carriers have blamed staff shortages for the long queues faced by passengers around the country in recent weeks. Many lost staff during the pandemic, some through redundancy, but also as employees left to take up other jobs elsewhere. Most have been in the process of rehiring thousands of staff, with demand for travel soaring after the lifting of Covid travel restrictions in the UK. But the rush to recruit has been accompanied by lengthy waits for security clearance, and staff absence amid high rates of coronavirus has worsened matters. The queues at airports have contributed to airline decisions to cut flights from their schedules – although they both are also struggling with staff shortages, from the combination of the Omicron variant spreading through their bases and the length of time for approve new recruits. British Airways has cancelled about 10% of its flights a day until the end of October. A spokesperson said: “While we ramp up our operation, we’re also building more resilience into our flying programme. One of the ways we’re doing this is by reducing our schedule ahead of time to give our customers certainty and options wherever possible.” EasyJet said it hoped not to cancel more flights after the end of May, but added that it was physically removing seats from about 50 of its A319 planes to allow them to operate with three rather than four cabin crew when staff shortages hit. Birmingham airport (BHX) said its queues were “long, but managed and moving”. It said it had decided to run those for security outside the terminal buildings to avoid crossing over with people waiting for check-in. About 15,000 passengers were due to depart on Monday, half of them in the peak early morning hours. It added: “Of the 7,500 customers booked to fly out of BHX in today’s dawn peak, 99.7% successfully caught their flights. Anyone who missed was rebooked.” The airport apologised, and appealed to passengers to be prepared to pass security to minimise delays: “Our message to departing customers is: help us help you keep queues moving by removing any liquids, gels, pastes and electrical items from your bags before our security x-ray scanners.”It laid off nearly half of its employees during the pandemic when travel restrictions hit its business. The airport began looking for new staff back in November and said it expected more security officers to be ready to start work soon. Manchester airport said it was continuing to experience longer than usual security queues at times, including on Monday morning, but was constantly bringing in new staff to tackle the problem. It said most passengers were passing security in 30-40 minutes, although queues could be more than double that. The airport has advised passengers to arrive three hours before their flight’s departure time, but not to come earlier to avoid adding to the congestion in the terminals.",News/Business,‘Chaos’ at Manchester and Birmingham airports as travellers face long queues,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/09/chaos-manchester-birmingham-airports-travellers-long-queues-staff-shortages
5/10/2022,"Two presidents and two speeches for Victory Day: from Vladimir Putin in Moscow and Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv. Both presidents talked more about the present day than the past. Both insisted their enemies today were the heirs of the Nazis, and both promised their countries would succeed in what they both said was a defensive war they had been forced to fight. There, however, the similarities between the two addresses by Putin and Zelenskiy came to an end. The first difference was stylistic: Putin was surrounded by the pomp and militarism of the annual Red Square parade, riffing on a topic he has been angry about for years. Zelenskiy, strolling along Kyiv’s main street and delivering a casual but impassioned speech straight into the camera, cut a very different figure, as he has since the start of the war. But the main difference was that for most people existing beyond the reach of Russian state television, Zelenskiy’s arguments were likely to be a lot more convincing than Putin’s. Putin has long used his 9 May speeches to draw parallels between the second world war and the present day, and this year’s speech was nothing new, simply a compilation of previous grievances that were recycled and intensified for this year, when his army is fighting a new war. But the images from that war, seen across the world, have made Putin’s politicisation of the Soviet wartime sacrifice even less convincing. Putin used the Victory Day podium to reel off a list of grievances against the west that seemed to describe his own regime more aptly. He made reference to “cancel culture”, complaining that so-called “traditional values” had been cancelled, despite the fact his regime has arrested people for Facebook posts and shut down numerous newspapers for calling the war in Ukraine a war, and not a “special military operation”, the officially approved euphemism. The west was “rewriting history”, Putin complained, ignoring the fact that his regime has done more than any in Europe to quash free historical inquiry about the war years. In modern Russia, the Soviet war effort is seen as sacred, immaculate and not to be sullied by historical inquiry or archival research that might shed light on some of its darker moments. The Russian army was fighting in Ukraine “so that there is no place in the world for butchers, murderers and Nazis”, said Putin, a particularly grim claim given the well-documented evidence of executions, rape, looting and desecration carried out by his troops. For some years, Putin has hinted at comparisons between the modern-day US and the Nazis, bemoaning American hegemony and the “unipolar world” that followed the Soviet collapse. Back in 2015, Putin used his Victory Day speech to say that “in the 1930s, enlightened Europe failed immediately to see the deathly threat of Nazi ideology … Seventy years later, history calls on us to be aware and alert once again. We have seen an effort to create a unipolar world, and we are seeing force-oriented thinking gain traction.” This year Putin made the comparison more explicitly. “The United States, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, began to talk about its exclusivity, humiliating the whole world,” he said. Over the years, Putin’s disquiet about American hegemony has resonated with many different political currents globally and is at the core of why some have admired the Russian president. This year, however, the invasion of Ukraine and occupation of parts of it has made Putin’s message harder to stomach, even for many of his fans. One of the telegrams Putin sent on the occasion of Victory Day was a message to the people of Ukraine, wishing them “good health, success and a long life”. Soon after the speech, air raid sirens sounded again in Kyiv.",News/World news,Putin uses Victory Day speech to rehash list of grievances against west,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/putin-victory-day-speech-rehash-grievances-west-russia-ukraine
5/10/2022,"A man waited in the woods before subjecting a police community support officer to “a brutal and fatal attack” as she walked her dog, a court has heard. Callum Wheeler, 22, is accused of using a “large metal railway jack” to murder Julia James in broad daylight on 27 April last year. James, 53, was found lying face-down in Ackholt Wood near her home in Snowdown, Kent, after taking her jack russell, Toby, on a walk to spot butterflies. Jurors at Canterbury crown court heard that Wheeler, who lives with his father in the neighbouring village of Aylesham, in Kent, accepts that he killed the mother-of-two but denies murder. Wearing a black blazer and a white shirt, Wheeler appeared in the dock flanked by four members of staff as the prosecutor Alison Morgan QC opened his trial. She said: “In the early afternoon of 27 April 2021, Julia James was murdered whilst she was out walking her dog in a wood near to her home in Snowdown in Kent. “The evidence suggests that her attacker was waiting in the woods for someone to attack and then ambushed her. Julia tried to escape her attacker but was subjected to a brutal and fatal attack. She sustained catastrophic injuries and died where she fell.” The prosecutor said there was “a large body of evidence” showing that Wheeler was the attacker. She added that detectives were able to use data from James’s Apple watch to chart her last moments. She added: “Although he denied responsibility for the killing for some time, he does now accept that he was the person that killed Julia James; however, he does not accept that he is guilty of the offence of murder.” The court heard that James had seen Wheeler in the vicinity of Ackholt Wood, where she would regularly walk her dog, in the months before the murder. The prosecutor said: “Julia James was herself aware of the presence of a strange male near to Ackholt Wood. On two occasions … she commented to her husband, Paul James, that she had passed someone who was a ‘really weird dude’.” She later pointed out the male, alleged to have been Wheeler, to her husband during a walk together in February 2021, about two months before her death. Other members of the public also reported spotting Wheeler. The court heard that James was killed with a metal railway jack, which was found later in the defendant’s home. The prosecutor told the jury: “A heavy blunt object was used to murder Julia James and when we come on to consider her injuries you will understand why it must have been an object of that type that killed her. “In fact, the prosecution alleges, and there may now be no dispute, that the weapon was a large railway jack.” She added: “That item was found in his bedroom.” The trial, which is expected to last four weeks, continues.",News/UK news,"Julia James killing: man subjected PCSO to ‘brutal attack’, court told",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/09/julia-james-killing-man-subjected-pcso-to-brutal-attack-court-told
5/10/2022,"Name: Making the bed. Age: Almost as old as lying in it. Appearance: Taut sheets, hospital corners, smoothed pillow cases, nice straight duvet. Are you telling me to make my bed? The current guidelines on best practice are conflicting. What does that mean? Some people say you should, others say you shouldn’t bother. Who’s in the make-your-bed camp? Your mum, most drill sergeants, Jordan Peterson. Jordan Peterson? The meat-only-eating Canadian philosopher? His book 12 Rules for Life implies that a tidy bedroom lays the foundation for a well-ordered psyche. Who’s in the lazy camp? TikTok, basically. I don’t take advice from TikTok. Well, a staggering amount of people do. A single post insisting you shouldn’t make your bed has been viewed more than 2.7m times. Having said that, I’m susceptible to the notion of ignoring common household chores. The post is one of many offering the same argument. What is the nature of that argument? It’s to do with dust mites. Dust mites? We routinely share our beds with up to 1.5 million of these microscopic creatures, and making your bed traps in moisture, creating an ideal environment for them to breed. What else do they get up to? They feed off dead skin cells and produce allergens that can trigger asthma. Forget about making my bed; I think I’m going to stop sleeping in it. According to TikTok, an unmade bed allows air and sunlight to kill off dust mites. Is any of this true? Dust mites are certainly real, and the TikTokers all seem to be referencing 2005 research from Kingston University, suggesting that leaving a bed unmade may cause mites to dehydrate and die. Great, so I’ll just sleep on their tiny dead bodies. Not everyone agreed anyway. “Most homes in the UK are sufficiently humid for the mites to do well,” said the allergy expert Prof Andrew Wardlaw. “I find it hard to believe that simply not making your bed would have any impact on the overall humidity.” As usual, we’re doomed either way. More practically, experts suggest you wash your bedding once a week, at a temperature of at least 60C. Fine, I’ll do that. And you should also wash your pillows – not just the cases, the actual pillows – every four to six months. You start by telling me lazy is good, and you end up giving me more chores. That’s life. Do say: “I just thought I’d let it air out a bit, Sarge.” Don’t say: “Goodnight moon, goodnight light, goodnight microscopic mite.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Making your bed is bad for you – just ask the experts on TikTok,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/09/making-bed-bad-for-you-ask-experts-tiktok
