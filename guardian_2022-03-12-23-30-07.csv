3/12/2022,"A camel killed two men after escaping a petting zoo in Tennessee, a county sheriff said. Officials from the Obion county sheriff’s office said the fatal incident unfolded around 5.44pm on Thursday, when they “received a call of a loose camel near Shirley Farms on South Bluff Road in Obion … attacking people”. When deputies arrived at the farm, approximately 100 miles from Memphis, they found “two unconscious victims on the ground” and “a camel still on the loose”. The sheriff’s department and other public safety agencies including the Tennessee highway patrol, Lake county sheriff’s office, Lake county rescue squad and Ridgely police tried to aid the victims and bring them to a safe location. The animal remained aggressive. Obion authorities said “the camel attacked an Obion county sheriff’s office vehicle then move[d] towards deputies who were attempting to move a victim to” emergency medical services. “It was at this time officers had to put the camel down for the safety of everyone on scene.” The statement said the two victims, identified as Bobby Matheny and Tommy Gunn, “did succumb to their injuries and were pronounced dead on scene”. Inspectors from the US Department of Agriculture had noted alleged animal care and regulatory issues at the petting zoo. In July 2019, an inspector said: “The only access to drinking water for the camels and zebra was a very small shallow muddy creek running through their enclosure. There was no access to any water troughs or other potable water source.” In October 2018, an inspector said: “The public (adults and children) were petting and feeding animals without any employee/attendant present.” The inspector also said: “There is a barrier present between the public and the non-human primates but not for any of the other species present including a zebra, camels, llamas, alpacas, goats, sheep, pigs, fallow deer, kangaroo, zebu, rabbits, cavy, and prairie dogs. “The only attendant noted present at the exhibit was the cashier who does not have a direct line of sight on any of the animals. To prevent injury to the public and the animals and to ensure proper human-animal interactions [and] feeding, an attendant must be present.” Shirley Farms could not immediately be reached for comment.",News/US news,Camel kills two men after escaping Tennessee petting zoo,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/12/camel-kills-two-tennessee-petting-zoo
3/12/2022,"The last time I saw Sean Bowie, AKA Yves Tumor, they were shirtless and writhing on stage, wreathed in dry ice. Their tall frame paced across a strobing backdrop as they belted out a lithe mix of experimental noise and nonchalant spoken word to a small, devoted moshpit of headbanging fans. The rest of us looked on, curious and somewhat bemused at this singular figure producing ear-splitting sounds as we waited for the main act, house producer Jacques Greene, to come on. That was in 2017 at the Electric Brixton. Five years on, Yves Tumor is the defiant headliner, and that mini-moshpit of fans has turned into the entire room. Tonight’s show had been scheduled once more for Electric Brixton but was upgraded to the Troxy, which has double the capacity. A hushed buzz of anticipation sweeps round the art deco space before Bowie steps out in an orb of light in front of two vast plinths housing the band. They have ample reason to treat this show like a victory lap. It’s just one stop on a mammoth and largely sold-out US and European tour in support of the performer’s fourth LP, Heaven to a Tortured Mind (2020) and last year’s EP The Asymptotical World. Bowie released their debut album, Serpent Music, in 2016 to critical intrigue. Teaching themselves music production to counter the boredom of growing up in Tennessee, they later moved to Leipzig and became immersed in the German city’s high-tempo experimental techno club scene. Recorded after spending three years there, Serpent Music is shot through with the dual influences of its nightlife and the American popular songwriting Bowie grew up with. It’s a record of atmospheric R&B with an experimental edge that sees melodies float over snatches of screams, whispered incantations and guttural basslines. Yet it was their next release, 2018’s Safe in the Hands of Love, that would catapult Yves Tumor to widespread acclaim. Pitchfork called the record a “benchmark in experimental music” for its freewheeling, omnivorous approach to genre – one given coherency through Bowie’s confident baritone voice. The album pitched them as an auteur with a remarkable ear and capacity to traverse everything from wonky pop ( Noid) to trip-hop (Licking an Orchid) and fractal breakbeats (Lifetime). Serpent Music earned Bowie comparisons to British avant-garde songwriter Dean Blunt for their delivery and often indecipherable lyrics, and to ostentatious rapper and Kanye West collaborator Mykki Blanco; Safe in the Hands of Love was so fluid as to be uncategorisable, closer to the shapeshifting flamboyance of David Bowie, as well as Prince. Tonight, Sean Bowie is dressed the part of carnal rock god: cut-out, skintight leather ensemble and jaunty hat perched above a face daubed in white clowning makeup. Each movement is languorous and intuitive: a hand placed on the hip and a leg kicked aside as they launch into latest single, Jackie – a late-80s pop homage distorted through hints of My Bloody Valentine’s tooth-rattling guitars – before hip-thrusting into the blistering instrumentals of Licking an Orchid. A group of fans standing next to me sing along, word perfect, to every track. In fact, the recent releases played tonight feel like Bowie’s most radio-friendly and commercially viable tracks to date. There is the stadium rock of Kerosene!, which begins deceptively quietly before the full glam rock explosion of its chorus guitar solo; the horn-fuelled fanfare of Gospel for a New Century, channelling Prince in its ecstatic phrasing; and the infectious funk of Romanticist. All are primed to get a live crowd moving. If the songs are hook-laden and spacious enough to fill a big room, so is Bowie’s presence. This might be a mid-capacity venue but they are playing it like a stadium. Fiery instrumental solos punctuate the seamless flow of tracks while Bowie cavorts in front of the crowd. The bass of the kick drum is almost deafening, but the gravelly vocals cut through, turning lines such as “some call it torture, baby I enjoy it” into a coy invitation. As the tracks peak, Bowie has the crowd in their gloved hands, pushing the arc of each song into a shredding instrumental climax before bringing the dynamic back down to the conspiratorial intimacy of a whisper. It’s a rollercoaster of a ride. This might be a stadium-worthy show, but it isn’t aiming for technical perfection or choreographed movement. At points it even feels like Bowie is pushing their voice to crack and break while shouting through the lyrics and gliding across the stage, in turn encouraging the audience to let go of their inhibitions – which they do. We are left wanting more after a swift 75-minute set, but one thing is certain as they saunter off stage: Yves Tumor’s star is born.",Arts/Music,Yves Tumor review – a star-making statement of intent,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/12/yves-tumor-troxy-london-live-review-sean-bowie-heaven-to-a-tortured-mind
3/12/2022,"What starts with “P” ends with “E” and is too terrifying a word for many people to so much as mention? “Palestine”, of course! Simply uttering the P-word in a vaguely sympathetic way can be enough to elicit bad faith accusations of antisemitism. The topic has become so loaded that some people seemingly prefer to pretend Palestine and Palestinians don’t exist and just ignore the issue altogether. Nothing makes liberals abandon their progressive values, or their courage, like someone mentioning Palestine. Vogue, I’m looking at you here. The magazine recently edited a reference to Palestine out of an Instagram post on its official social media page that was dedicated to supermodel Gigi Hadid’s pledge to donate her all her Fashion Month earnings to relief efforts in Ukraine and Palestine. Last Sunday Gigi, who is half Palestinian, announced that she was giving her earnings to “to aid those suffering from the war in Ukraine, as well as continuing to support those experiencing the same in Palestine. Our eyes and hearts must be open to all human injustice”. Vogue initially included the reference to Palestine in the post but removed it after it was accused by a number of pro-Israel voices, in very bad faith, of furthering antisemitism. After an outcry from people who pointed out that it is not antisemitic to support Palestinians, Vogue then amended the post a third time to put the reference back in. This isn’t the first time that a Hadid has had their comments about Palestine erased on Instagram, by the way. Last year Bella Hadid posted a photo on Instagram of her dad’s US passport which listed his birthplace as Palestine. The social network quickly removed it. Why? According to Instagram the post violated “community guidelines on harassment or bullying” as well as regulations on “hate speech”. After Bella spoke out Instagram offered a few other explanations for it being removed, and then said “Whoops, it was a mistake!” Like the Hadid sisters, my dad is a Palestinian refugee. Like the Hadid sisters, I’ve also found myself harassed and vilified for daring to suggest that Palestinians deserve human rights. (Unlike the Hadid sisters, alas, I am not a supermodel). As I’ve written previously, there is seemingly no acceptable way for a Palestinian to protest oppression or stand up for our rights. The Russian invasion of Ukraine is heartbreaking. But I want to be very clear that standing with Ukrainians, as we all must do, doesn’t mean ignoring injustice and oppression everywhere else. It doesn’t diminish the struggles of the Ukranian people to ask questions about double standards. It doesn’t detract or distract from what is happening in Ukraine, for example, to ask why a viral picture of a small blonde girl standing up to a solider in front of a tank was celebrated when people thought that girl was Ukrainian but treated very differently when it was pointed out that the girl was actually Ahed Tamimi, a Palestinian, standing in front of an Israeli soldier. Indeed, it is desperately important that we ask these sorts of questions. “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,” Martin Luther King said. Those are not just pretty words. When you ignore international law in one area then you help weaken international law around the world. When you shrug your shoulders about oppression in one place, you help open up the doors to it in another. Solidarity is not a distraction – it is a verb. Republican state representative Brian Seitz has introduced a restrictive abortion law that would, among other things, outlaw medication given to someone with an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies, where a fertilized egg implants outside of a uterus, are not viable: the legislation is basically telling women to choose between jail and death. “This is what it looks like when uneducated politicians try and legislate our bodies,” a representative from Planned Parenthood told Newsweek in a statement. Unfortunately there are endless examples of this sort of ignorance: a couple of years ago Ohio introduced legislation requiring doctors to “reimplant an ectopic pregnancy” into a woman’s uterus or face charges of “abortion murder”. The problem with that? The procedure does not exist in medical science. Sandberg offered this opinion in Dubai during a Cartier event marking International Women’s Day. (A strange place to celebrate IWD, seeing as Dubai has a very dodgy track record when it comes to women’s rights and human rights in general.) The idea that a world run by women would automatically be a kinder, better place is head-bangingly simplistic. Having more women in power means nothing if those women simply lean into a patriarchal model of leadership. What would make the world a better place is if we embraced a more “feminine” model of leadership: it’s an important distinction, which (self-promotion alert!) I happen to have written a book about. Speaking of terrible female leaders, MTG has once again demonstrated that she appears to have zero morals whatsoever. Pictures of a visibly injured Mariana Vishegirskaya leaving the maternity hospital were targeted by a vile Russia disinformation campaign accusing her of faking the injuries. In happier photos taken on Friday, Vishegirskaya holds her new baby daughter Veronika. One million people across the UK are on zero-hours contracts, and women of colour are overrepresented. The Trades Union Congress describes it as “structural racism in action”. The school was shocked Toby Price would dare to read the book to second-graders when it contained dangerous words like “butt” and “fart”. Continuing the butt theme, Kardashian has taken it upon herself to tell women that the key to success is simply hustling harder. “It seems like nobody wants to work these days,” Kardashian complained to Variety. Her thoughts have not gone down very well. A new study has found that just 10 minutes with a therapy dog can help relieve patients’ pain in the emergency room. Dogs really do make everything better.",Opinion/Opinion,"Nothing makes liberals abandon their values, or their courage, like mentioning Palestine",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/12/gigi-hadid-palestine-vogue-liberals-ukraine
3/12/2022,"I had a beautiful and loving childhood. I wasn’t raised by my mother. She left when I was only five, so I lived with my father and stepmother. But I saw Mum every other weekend and my parents got on super-well. We often went on holidays together. It wasn’t a problem. Mum was super-cool. It was the 1980s, she wore a lot of Kenzo. All those blouses, flowers, colour… A lot of red. I love red because of her. I was a tomboy and my stepmother was like a Saint Laurent model. She’s an attractive black Caribbean woman. So chic. But it always got on my nerves because she’d spend so long putting on makeup and getting ready. Playing around with garments was my way of making people notice me. I wasn’t a pretty child. My father had lovely paisley silk robes from Bloomingdale’s. I used to wear them to school with tartan slippers and everyone thought I was weird. Although the main reason was that I just had a very precise idea of what I wanted to wear. My plan was only to make things that I wanted to wear and to share my love of craft. We call fashion an industry, but there’s a human being behind everything we do and make. There are a lot of people in fashion who take themselves very seriously. We’re not saving lives. Sometimes when I am despairing about something, I say to myself, “Oh come on, Isabel!” You have to put things in perspective. I couldn’t live without music. I love hip-hop, jazz, electronic, rock, reggae… I do a lot of DJing at my own parties.I play the right tracks though. I can put a good energy out there. But I call myself DJ Moufle [mittens] because I always press the wrong buttons. After music, my big passion is welding. I started in fashion with a small collection of brass jewellery. Then I started to weld furniture to display my clothes on. Now my son Tala, 18, has taken all my tools. It’s funny; he’s doing exactly what I was doing as a kid. He’s turned his bedroom into a workshop and makes crazy things all day long. I say I’m not worried about ageing, but of course I look in the mirror and sometimes don’t like what I see. I’m about to turn 55 – it’s the most delicate age for a woman. I wouldn’t mind being Louise Bourgeois aged 80 with a lot of wrinkles; it’s very beautiful to see the signs of your spent life. But the in-between is not great. Trying on almost everything I design is important. We have all these young models with their great bodies, but I have to put an outfit on, too, so I can see what it does on an old head, with not such a perfect body. Always cook for 20 people, never for two. I tend to have a lot of people over at weekends. I’m very French. I make pot au feu or blanquette. I don’t consider myself a famous, designerbut you do meet people and they think you’re a kind of god.

3/12/2022,"Decades before Peter Jackson directed his epic adaptations of The Lord of the Rings, JRR Tolkien was involved with the first ever dramatisation of his trilogy, but its significance was not realised in the 1950s and the BBC’s audio recordings are believed to have been destroyed. Now an Oxford academic has delved into the BBC archives and discovered the original scripts for the two series of 12 radio episodes broadcast in 1955 and 1956, to the excitement of fellow scholars. Tolkien’s fantasy masterpiece was dramatised by producer Terence Tiller, whose scribbled markings on the manuscript no doubt reflect his detailed discussions with the author in correspondence and meetings. Among the typed pages is a sheet in Tolkien’s hand, with red crossings-out, showing his own reworking of a scene. Stuart Lee, a reader in the English faculty at Oxford University, said: “They said the scripts had been lost, but they have survived – the only professional dramatisation of The Lord of the Rings made during his [Tolkein’s] lifetime. It was not seen as important by the BBC then. It shows how reception of the book has changed – minor interest in 1955-56, now a global phenomenon, with Amazon reportedly investing more than $1bn in the latest series.” Lee’s discovery will feature in a forthcomingnew book, The Great Tales Never End: Essays in Memory of Christopher Tolkien, in which academics pay tribute to the scholarship of Tolkien’s devoted son and literary executor, who died in 2020. The book, to be published in June by Bodleian Library Publishing, is co-edited by Richard Ovenden, Oxford University’s Bodley’s librarian, and Catherine McIlwaine, Tolkien archivist at the Bodleian Libraries. “As fans await the Amazon Prime series based on the Second Age of Middle-earth, here we have Tolkien himself engaging with the earliest adaptation of The Lord of the Rings,” said McIlwaine. She added: “Not only did he agree to the adaptation of his book soon after publication, but he was willing to work with the scriptwriters, to abridge the text and adjust the balance of narration and dialogue, so that it fitted the requirements of radio and the limited time available. It’s a very exciting and timely discovery.” The series were broadcast shortly after Tolkien’s original was published in three parts. While the first series covered The Fellowship of the Ring in six episodes, the second series condensed The Two Towers and The Return of the King into the next six episodes and BBC bosses reduced each of them from 45 to 30 minutes – to the dismay of Tolkien. Lee said: “Seventy years on, we would treat it like a sacred text. These scripts reveal that, in the 1950s, they didn’t have any inclination of how important a text it would be.” He argued: “Had the books been out longer and become more established, then perhaps the BBC senior managers would have agreed to each episode lasting 45 minutes and even running to three series.” Tolkien, who died in 1973, was instinctively wary of such dramatisations, particularly after seeing Walt Disney films such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, based on the darker 1812 Brothers Grimm fairytale. In 1937 he wrote of his “heartfelt loathing” for Disney productions. Lee expressed surprise that the sheet bearing Tolkien’s writing had been overlooked until now. While one scholar had noted its existence, it was not fully discussed and Lee is publishing it in his essay for the forthcoming book. It bears Tolkien’s redrafting of a scene in which Frodo Baggins, the hobbit who received a magic ring of invisibility, his companion Sam and the warrior Aragorn refer to the evil wraiths – undead beings: Frodo: What has happened? Where is the pale King? Sam: We lost you, Mr Frodo. Where did you get to? Frodo: Didn’t you see them? – the wraiths, and the King? Aragorn: No, only their shadows… Tolkien gave a description of the wraiths to the narrator, who linked the scenes: “At once the shapes became terribly clear. He could see under their black mantles. In their white faces burned merciless eyes…” Lee said: “Without the freedom allowed to him in the novel, he considered the best way to convey a description of the wraiths, first rather clumsily getting Frodo Baggins to say ‘I… I put the ring on. Then the shapes became terribly clear, and I could see under their black cloaks. Their faces were white with cruel bright eyes…’ But he rejected this, favouring instead the use of the narrator.” The BBC files have also preserved audience reactions in the 1950s. One listener complained: “If we must occupy the Third Programme with fairytales then let us have Enid Blyton.” But the Observer’s critic described the dramatisation as “the best light listening for the next five weeks”.

3/12/2022,"In a world beset by traumas, there has been a marked new age turn in music in recent years. The likes of Jenny Hval, Björk and Gang Gang Dance have made thoughtful use of therapeutic sounds while cleaving closer to this plane than ambient musical adventurers of yore. Even more so Yokohama-born, London-based composer and sound engineer Hinako Omori. Her debut album, A Journey…, is born of an immersive project created at Peter Gabriel’s Real World studios for the 2020 lockdown version of the Womad festival, and is inspired by the 1980s Japanese therapy of shinrin-yoku, “forest bathing”, a walk in the woods as an exercise in awareness. Field recordings from the Chew Valley, Mendip Hills and the Wiltshire fields near Real World become a solarpunk sci-fi soundtrack on the likes of Spaceship Lament, in which sparse, silvery hazes and hyperdrive arpeggios are lit by suddenly transfixing swoops of synth. Time becomes elastic in Will You Listen In; its soft blooms, swells of synth, interweaving whispers and soft cries are made for Pauline Oliveros-style deep attention. A word of warning, though, on the album’s “healing” frequencies and binaural beats: “As a disclaimer, I’d recommend not listening to the music while operating machinery,” Omori has said. “A relaxed environment would be better.” A Journey… will be released on 18 March on Houndstooth.

3/12/2022,"UK ministers have announced plans to pile further pressure on Vladimir Putin by banning exports of luxury goods to Russia as the health secretary accused Moscow of war crimes following repeated attacks on Ukrainian hospitals. The announcement of the plans, details of which Downing Street said would be set out in the coming days, came as the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and other G7 leaders committed to increasing pressure on the Russian president. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, heavily criticised Russia for its attacks on health facilities and accused its forces of war crimes. He said Russia must stop its aggression, describing the invasion of Ukraine as “a war started by Russia, completely unprovoked, completely unjustified”. He added: “What we are seeing from Russia, especially the attacks on health facilities, where the WHO have reported over 25 health facilities, including hospitals, have been targeted or hit for whatever reason, [is] completely unacceptable reasons by Russian forces. “This is a war crime, and Russia will pay for the crimes that it is carrying out in Ukraine today.” The UK has sanctioned nearly 400 Russian parliamentarians as ministers attempt to “tighten the screw” on Moscow. The G7 agreed to take steps to deny Russia its “most favoured nation” status on key products, which Number 10 said would significantly cut Russian businesses’ ability to export. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said the UK stood “united with our G7 partners” and that it would “continue strengthening our response” to put pressure on Russia. But the government came under criticism from Labour, which said the ban should already have been implemented. “Labour has been calling for weeks now for a ban on luxury goods being sent to Russia, so it is welcome that the UK government have finally listened – but it should not have taken this long,” said Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow international trade secretary. “We cannot allow Putin, and his cronies in Moscow, to live a Mayfair lifestyle while they kill innocent people in their illegal invasion of Ukraine.” The French president, Emmanuel Macron, also condemned Johnson’s government, accusing them of making Ukrainian refugees unwelcome in the UK and pretending to lead the world on the issue by failing to live up to its “grand statements”. “I would hope that the Ukrainian men and women who have lived through horror and crossed Europe to reach their families on UK territory will be better treated,” he said on Friday at the end of an EU summit in Versailles. Meanwhile, Jeremy Hunt, the former foreign secretary, accused the west of causing “war through weakness”. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, the Conservative MP described Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as “the biggest failure of western foreign and security policy in our lifetimes”. “It happened because we forgot the most fundamental lesson of the cold war: the power of deterrence,” he wrote, adding: “Instead of peace through strength we caused war through weakness.” He also called on the UK to increase its spending on defence, aid and “soft power” to at least 4% of GDP over the next 10 years.",News/World news,UK announces plan to ban exports of luxury goods to Russia ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/uk-announces-plan-to-ban-exports-of-luxury-goods-to-russia
3/12/2022,"When the lights go out in Bahrain for the first race of the new Formula One season next Sunday, the rolling thunder of engines will potentially presage a mighty storm. For the reigning champion, Max Verstappen, and the seven-times title-winner Lewis Hamilton this is battle rejoined, a tempest to revel in. After the pair went head to head for 22 races last year, they will surely once more be at the schwerpunkt of this championship fight. Hamilton’s pedigree is well known: at 37 he is the most successful F1 driver of all time. On last season’s form the Briton is at the top of his game and this time motivated perhaps like never before after he and his Mercedes team felt they were robbed of the title amid the controversy of last year’s final round in Abu Dhabi, when Verstappen secured the win and his first championship. The Dutchman, in contrast, has the potential to rack up more titles but is in new territory defending his first. He is still only 24 but while he is entering his eighth F1 season the pressure he faces is intense, ratcheted up by the ferocity of the pair’s fight last year that saw them clash repeatedly on track as they battled for every advantage. It was gripping, both fighting their corner, both convinced of the righteousness of their cause. By the close Hamilton felt hard done by with the decisions in Abu Dhabi that cost him a record eighth title, but Verstappen has been adamant his performances across the season more than earned him the championship. If Verstappen is feeling any pressure his demeanour does not betray it. He was relaxed and jovial at testing, as befits a driver for whom driving is all and who is most comfortable in a car. “He has no interest in selling himself, he is a very private guy,” says his Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner. “He loves what he does, fame can often sit uncomfortably with him. He just wants to drive a car, he just wants to race. He is such an easy guy to work with, so passionate that 98% of the discussion is about racing. F1, esport, junior formulas, young drivers, karting, that’s his mojo.” Last season, his first in a car genuinely able to compete for the title, Verstappen was Mr Mojo Risin’, doing what he loves and delivering some emphatic drives that belied his tender years. For all the controversy over his uncompromising, aggressive style – and he does without doubt cross the line on occasion – he put in some outstanding performances to take him to a record 18 podiums, including 10 wins and 10 poles. He was untouchable in Monaco, exceptional in France – taking an extra stop to come back nervelessly at Hamilton in the dying moments for victory – and defended brilliantly against his rival in Austin. These were pressure moments and Verstappen had them in his pocket. They were allied to some extraordinary consistency, too. He was first or second in every race where he finished without damage. In Hungary he finished ninth after his car took a battering in a first corner incident, and he retired in Baku and at Silverstone and Monza. The last of those results was a salutary lesson of what that unnecessary aggression can cost. Horner believes his strengths are often not given the credit they are due. He cites his resilience, self-belief and undeniable natural ability. Notably, however, he also highlights last year’s Dutch GP as exemplifying why he is confident his driver will remain cool in the maelstrom of this new season. “In Zandvoort the expectation was so high, I have never seen so much pressure on the grid,” he says. “He has the whole nation supporting him, 120,000 Dutch fans going mad, the royal family standing by the side of the car … But I remember as he put his helmet on, he was completely in his own zone. He had compartmentalised what he needed to do and detached himself from the emotion.” Last season, relations between Mercedes and Red Bull and notably their team principals, Horner and Toto Wolff, grew increasingly ill-tempered. Even now Horner cannot resist another sideways elbow at Hamilton’s celebrations after his victories at Silverstone while pointing out his own driver’s steely focus. “Yes, Max was delighted to win his home race, but there was no crowdsurfing,” he says. “Of course he was happy but I travelled with him to the airport and it was all about the next race, the next, and the next.” The Red Bull director of motorsport, Dr Helmut Marko, has expressed fears that Verstappen’s career could be curtailed by more seasons of such relentless intensity. Yet Horner is confident his man can handle it. “He is only 24 but has real mental strength, particularly with all the games that were being played to try and unsettle him,” he says. “He is going up against a very seasoned campaigner, the most successful driver of all time who knows every trick in the book to get to his opponent. The way he dealt with that was exemplary.” Hamilton has always denied playing any games with his opponents, of course, and this year is bringing a wealth of experience and a desire to assert his authority over the young pretender in what would be the crowning achievement of a remarkable career. He and Mercedes are determined to do so after last year’s disappointment. Anthony Davidson has known Hamilton since they were kids in karting. Now an analyst for Sky Sports’ live coverage of F1, he is also at the heart of the Mercedes operation as one of their simulator drivers. He has observed an ominous resolve in Hamilton this season. “I see and hear a very determined Lewis Hamilton,” he said. “When he says: ‘If you think you have seen the best of me then wait until this year, you haven’t seen anything yet,’ that’s a big statement and not said in a flippant way. If I was going up against him I would be quite worried by that. I don’t take that attitude lightly at all. If he has the car this year then we are in for something special.” The car will be crucial and with the new designs from new regulations, Bahrain will be the first real chance to see if one team has stolen an advantage. Certainly Ferrari’s form in testing was impressive and if they can join the fight with Red Bull and Mercedes, this season will be all the richer. Hamilton’s team, however, may yet have the edge with their radical design approach, a source of controversy before a wheel has turned in anger. But if Verstappen must weather another fearsome deluge from Mercedes, there is no doubt at Red Bull he will only thrive in what F1 hopes will be the exhilaration and drama of a perfect storm. “What Max achieved in an era of total dominance by Mercedes that no one had been able to break until we managed it last year is right up there,” says Horner. “Given his youth and ability to improve, the best is yet to come.”",Sport/Sport,Verstappen v Hamilton: F1 champion ready to renew blockbuster rivalry,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/12/max-verstappen-lewis-hamilton-f1-new-season-bahrain
