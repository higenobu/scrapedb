12/14/2021,"Scientists have detected new cracks in the key ice shelf that buttresses Antarctica's Thwaites Glacier, indicating that the ice shelf could break apart within the next five years. Why it matters: The destruction of the ice shelf could accelerate the movement of inland ice into the sea, eventually causing sea levels to rise by several feet and endangering coastal communities worldwide, per the Washington Post. Get market news worthy of your time with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free. State of play: The Thwaites Glacier is known as the ""doomsday glacier,"" due to the possibility that it may already be past a tipping point into a virtually unstoppable, runaway melt. Roughly the size of Florida, the Thwaites Glacier's meltwater already contributes to about 4% of global sea level rise. The Thwaites Eastern Ice Shelf acts as a brace preventing faster flow of meltwater from the glacier, and the shelf is held in place by an underwater mountain, according to the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University of Colorado, Boulder. This part of the ice shelf was previously thought to be stable until scientists took new measurements during a field campaign over the past two years. Warming ocean water is melting the ice from below, meaning the shelf is gradually losing its grip on the underwater mountain and satellite imagery has revealed fractures in the shelf. ""Similar to a growing crack in the windshield of a car, a slowly growing crack means the windshield is weak and a small bump to the car might cause the windshield to suddenly break apart into hundreds of panes of glass,"" reads a summary of the findings. The breaking of the ice shelf will increase the flow of ice off Antarctica, it adds. The big picture: The Thwaites Glacier is situated in a deep basin, so if it collapses, neighboring glaciers would follow, and over the next few centuries it could lead to the loss of the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet, contributing to a large rise in sea levels, according to Science. “That would be a global change,” Robert DeConto, a glaciologist at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, told Science. “Our coastlines will look different from space.” More from Axios: Sign up to get the latest market trends with Axios Markets.

For them, it's a new life free from fear and violence. ""I'm 18-years-old and I haven't had peace in my life yet."" Shogufa Safi is the conductor of Zohra, an all-female orchestra within the Institute, based in Kabul. They have played at some of the world's major concert venues, from New York's Carnegie Hall to Oman's Royal Opera House. When the Taliban took over in August, the Institute's founder and director knew he had to get his students out of the country. The Islamist group banned music under their previous regime in the 1990s. There've been reports of radio stations in parts of Afghanistan being forced to stop playing music. The Institute's members escaped to Qatar with the help of various donors, before making their way to Portugal. Even though the future of music looks bleak in Afghanistan, Safi's heart is still set on going back.

12/14/2021,"ELLIOTT, Iowa (AP) — A coalition of California restaurants and grocery stores has filed a lawsuit to block implementation of a new farm animal welfare law, adding to uncertainty about whether bacon and other fresh pork products will be much more expensive or in short supply in the state when the new rules take effect on New Year's Day. The lawsuit is the latest step in a tumultuous three-year process of enacting rules overwhelmingly approved by voters but that remain in question even as the law is set to begin. Since voters approved Proposition 12 by a 2-to-1 ratio in November 2018, state officials have missed deadlines for releasing specific regulations covering the humane treatment of animals that provide meat for the California market.  Most hog producers haven't made changes to comply with the law. And now a coalition of business owners is seeking more than a two-year delay. “We’re saying this is not going to work,” said Nate Rose, a spokesman for the California Grocers Association. While groups are working to delay the measure, the state has eased the transition to the new system. It has allowed pork processed under the old rules and held in cold storage to be sold in California in 2022, which could prevent shortages for weeks or even months. As Josh Balk, who leads farm animal protection efforts at the Humane Society of the United States, put it, California residents need not fear “pork industry claims of the apocalypse.""  Put simply, the law requires that breeding pigs, egg-laying chickens and veal calves be given enough space to stand and turn around. For pigs, that means they no longer can be kept in narrow ""gestation crates"" and must have 24 square feet (2.23 square meters) of usable space. Producers of eggs and veal appear able to meet the new law, but hog farmers argued the changes would be too expensive and couldn’t be carried out until the state approved final regulations for the new standards. An estimate from North Carolina State University found the new standard would cost about 15% more per animal for a farm with 1,000 breeding pigs. The National Pork Producers Council has challenged California's right to impose standards on businesses in other states, but so far those efforts have failed. California is the nation’s largest market for pork, and producers in major hog states like Iowa provide more than 80% of the roughly 255 million pounds (115 million kilograms) that California’s restaurants and groceries use each month, according to Rabobank, a global food and agriculture financial services company. Without that supply, it’s unclear if a state that consumes about 13% of the nation's pork supply will have all the meat it demands. The North American Meat Institute, an industry group, said packers and processors “will do their best to serve the California market."" “What will happen in California? I don’t know,” said Michael Formica, the general counsel for the National Pork Producers Council. “One thing we know is there will be finite supplies to sell there.” Adding to the uncertainty is the lawsuit filed last month in Sacramento County by the California Grocers Association, California Restaurant Association, California Hispanic Chambers of Commerce, California Retailers Association and Kruse & Sons, a meat processor. The suit seeks a 28-month delay until final regulations for enforcement of the rules are officially adopted. California's agriculture and health departments have said the voter-backed measure didn't give them enough time to approve final regulations. The agencies were still accepting public comments for revisions in December. That means it could be months before final rules are approved. Given that delay, the groups claim in the lawsuit that they can't be sure they're complying and could be subject to penalties stipulated in the law. “Our concern is the uncertainty,” said Rose, of the grocers association. He said a judge has scheduled a hearing for March, but the group is pushing for an earlier date. If the law takes effect Jan. 1, it’s possible the state could avoid immediate shortages or steep price increases because the industry has about 466 million pounds (211 million kilograms) of pork in storage. Not all of that meat can be sent to California, of course, but when combined with new supplies from processors that meet the new standards, it should meet at least some of the demand. If there is a disruption, it “would be significantly smoothed,” said Daniel Sumner, a professor at the University of California-Davis, who teamed with colleagues to study the price and supply implications of Proposition 12. While an earlier study projected bacon prices soaring by up to 60% in California, a UC-Davis report estimated that the uncooked pork prices rising eventually by a more manageable 8% in California. Massachusetts has approved a similar animal welfare law that takes effect next month, but state lawmakers are considering a one-year delay because of supply concerns. The accuracy of the California estimates could depend on how many farmers adopt the new standards and how long the transition takes.  Iowa farmer Ron Mardesen already meets the California standards, and for much of the year gives sows free rein to roam through large areas of his farm about 100 miles (160 kilometers) southwest of Des Moines.  With so much room, “They’re like a bunch of big, old sisters,” he said. “You can tell they’re happy. No one is squealing or crying.” Chris Oliviero, general manager of Niman Ranch, a specialty meat company in Westminster, Colorado, said he hopes California’s new rules help change a system he calls “lower cost at any cost.” Although Niman charges more for its pork, he said he hopes the new California rules help limit the environmental consequences of large-scale animal agriculture.  “There is volatility in the markets, so I understand the fears that comes with that, but I also think most large agricultural companies have shown that when they put their mind to it they’re very capable of solving complex problems,” Oliviero said.  ___ Follow Scott McFetridge on Twitter: https://twitter.com/smcfetridge ___ This story has been updated to correct the amount of pork consumed in California and the amount in cold storage.

12/14/2021,"Consider the two faces of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). First, the Rand Paul of Dec. 11, writing to President Biden after a string of tornadoes devastated his home state, killing at least 64 and leveling whole communities: ""The Governor of the Commonwealth has requested federal assistance this morning, and certainly further requests will be coming as the situation is assessed. I fully support those requests and ask that you move expeditiously to approve the appropriate resources for our state."" People here will say they have great compassion and they want to help the people of Puerto Rico, the people of Texas, the people of Florida, but notice they have great compassion with someone else's money. Sen. Rand Paul, 2017 Second, the Rand Paul of Oct. 24, 2017, on the Senate floor opposing a $36.5-billion disaster aid bill to help residents of Texas, Louisiana, Florida and Puerto Rico after hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria as well as victims of wildfires in California: ""People here will say they have great compassion and they want to help the people of Puerto Rico, the people of Texas, the people of Florida, but notice they have great compassion with someone else's money. Ask them what they're doing to help their fellow man."" One almost feels guilty pointing out the hypocrisy of people like Paul, because it's just so easy. A cursory glance at his record indicates that he has consistently opposed federal disaster relief measures. The received wisdom is that he has voted against every one for the last 10 years; it's hard to confirm that precisely, but examples of his speaking against most of them are easy to find. The Governor of the Commonwealth has requested federal assistance this morning... I fully support those requests and ask that you move expeditiously to approve the appropriate resources for our state. Sen. Rand Paul, 2021 (to President Biden) Paul also has opposed coronavirus relief measures, such as the first pandemic response act, passed in March 2020 with a 96-1 senate vote, Rand standing against it alone. He also opposed a 2020 bill to aid first responders still suffering from the effects of 9/11. On disaster aid, Paul voted against a 2013 bill to aid victims of Hurricane Sandy, and earlier this year blocked accelerated passage of the Gulf Coast Hurricane Aid Act, a measure to aid victims of the storms in Louisiana. It's still pending. In all those cases, Paul has couched his opposition as protests against the funding for those bills, specifically the borrowing to pay for them. He's argued that they should all be funded by taking money from other causes, specifically from foreign aid, about which he's strongly critical. One would like to admire Paul for consistency, at least, except that he's been selective about his anti-spending positions. He voted in favor of the 2017 tax cuts, one of the largest budget-busting measures in recent history (and one that chiefly benefits rich people), for instance. The tax cuts passed the Senate without a single Republican in opposition or a single Democrat in favor. That points to a fundamental difference between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to disaster aid. Republicans are cheeseparing about public aid until and unless it's for their constituents specifically; Democrats tend to see the issue broadly, favoring these programs regardless of geography. Republican posturing against disaster aid ""for thee, but not for me"" is a hardy perennial on Capitol Hill. In 2019, noted the Center for American Progress, 43 of the 58 GOP House members who voted against a $19-billion disaster relief bill had earlier ""demanded or endorsed emergency aid funding for their own states."" The measure, which had already been approved by the Senate, passed the House 354-58, with all the ""no"" votes coming from Republicans. In 2013, a $50.5-billion relief package for Hurricane Sandy, which had devastated the Northeast, was opposed by 36 Republican senators. Of those votes, 31 came fromRepublicans who had previously sought disaster aid for their own states. Among the opponents were Paul and Senators Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who had both sought relief aid for their own states from Hurricane Sandy. Through his Congressional office, Paul told me, ""The truth is that I’ve consistently advocated for FEMA disaster money for KY over my 11 years in office, dozens of times."" Well, yes. But what about when disasters strike outside Kentucky? Paul continued, ""When additional supplemental disaster funds above that budgeted each year have been sought, I have asked that the additional money come from cutting waste elsewhere in the budget.“ Of course, waste in government budgets are often in the eyes of the beholder. Paul thinks that foreign aid is a ""waste."" Not everyone might agree. On occasion, savvy politicians can use disasters elsewhere to secure money for their own purposes. The best example of this dates from the 1920s, when the Imperial Valley's congressman, Phil Swing, needed to quell opposition to the Boulder Canyon Act, which would fund the project that became Hoover Dam. A 1927 flood on the Mississippi killed 246 people, sweeping away bridges and breaching the levees over a thousand-mile stretch of the river. A member of the House Flood Control Committee, Swing convened hearings on a levee construction program costing an unprecedented $300 million and invited New Orleans business and political leaders to attend. “I took on the New Orleans men one after another,"" Swing would recount, ""putting to them again and again whether they could see any difference between the Mississippi’s flood threat to their people and the Colorado River flood threat to the people of the Imperial Valley…. The Editor of the New Orleans Picayune came up to give me warm assurances that they would all work for my bill."" The bill passed, and the dam project was launched four years later. Raising spending issues to denigrate projects you think are irrelevant to your own constituents has been known to devolve into farce. Remember the GOP response to President Obama's first State of the Union message in 2009? Then-Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, the designated responder being puffed up at the time as a potential presidential candidate, mined Obama's recession recovery bill for provisions he could ridicule. The measure included ""$140 million for something called volcano monitoring,” Jindal mocked. “Instead of monitoring volcanoes, what Congress should be monitoring is the eruption of spending in Washington, D.C."" Less than one month later, Alaska's Mt. Redoubt erupted, threatening Anchorage with an ash storm and forcing the delay or cancellation of commercial flights that passed over the area. Leaving aside that active volcanoes around the U.S. potentially threaten thousands of Americans with mudslides, poisonous gas emissions and lava flows, the $140 million Jindal cited covered not only volcano monitoring, but economic recovery funds for his own state. Republicans aren't alone in exploiting budget fears to hobble government assistance. Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), has set a new standard for the practice by opposing relief measures that would help his own state more than most others. ""Few states are as reliant as West Virginia on federal money, or get back more than residents pay in taxes,"" my colleague Jackie Calmes observed in reviewing Manchin's opposition to elements of President Biden's Build Back Better plan. ""Manchin’s constituents relied on federal aid for 33.3% of all personal income last year,"" compared with 20% in California. Among the provisions of the spending bill Manchin says he opposes are paid family and medical leave, home healthcare services and an extension of the child tax credit, all of which would flow to struggling West Virginians. Congressional critics of government spending aren't above taking credit for it when it serves their constituents. That's been the case with coronavirus aid and the $1.2-trillion infrastructure spending bill passed by Congress in November despite the opposition of 200 GOP members of the House and 30 of the 50 Republican senators (including Paul). Among those who have bragged about money reaching their districts or states from these bills after having voted against them are House members Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina and Gary Palmer of Alabama and Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi. The lesson that conservatives are constantly confronted with but never learn is that we're all in this world together. Disasters, whether climatological, meteorological or biological, know nothing of geographic boundaries, much less political or ideological ones. Conservatives oppose government spending on infrastructure and social programs only rhetorically because they do know a few things. They know the spending will help their constituents. They also know that the best way to establish their conservative cred is to oppose it, especially when they know it will pass anyway. Most of all, they know that more responsible political leaders will ensure that assistance gets to those in need, regardless of how their political representatives vote. Those elected representatives are happy to see the money, they just won't lift a finger to bring it home. There's a word for this sort of behavior: It's ""freeloading.""

12/14/2021,"“Is there a problem, Officer?” My voice strains with politeness, the tone I might use if I were a sommelier recommending a pinot grigio to a patron at a high-end restaurant. It is a well-practiced voice, one intended to dampen confrontation. Until that encounter, it never occurred to me how deeply problematic it is that some of us must scrutinize our tone and gestures for fear of repercussion when it comes to dealing with authority. “License and registration. Now!” The cop, Murphy, whose name, badge number, and visage are forever branded into my mind, dispenses with the pleasantries and takes a cursory glance at my identification. I try to press my university ID card into his hand as well. “What the fuck is this? Your lawyer?” “No, Officer.” I falter, trying to compose myself. My cousin looks on from the passenger’s side. “It’s where I work. I’m a professor in Connecticut, sir, and I’m just trying to get home to my family.” “Care where you work?” Murphy grumbles. “Out boozing, were we?” I shake my head “no,” but he orders me out of the car to perform a field sobriety test. I touch my nose with my pinky, balance on one foot and then the other, then walk the length of the sidewalk heel to toe. During this time, three other police cruisers pull up behind us. New York City, even at this hour, a little before midnight, strums with vibrancy, the air electric with nights out just beginning for some and ending for others. I could see crowds of people out of the corner of my eye, some glancing at us with mild interest, but most oblivious, heading steadfastly to their destination. I go through the paces in the shadow of Herald Square, where the bronze hands of the clock holding Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom and warfare, turn too slowly for an eye to follow. Mike Bloomberg Can’t Hide How He Helped Terrorize Black People With Stop and Frisk Policing “Look pretty steady on your feet, but I got one more test for you.” Murphy looks slightly bemused, the corner of his mouth wrinkling into a jagged smirk. “The Breathalyzer!” The whole exchange has begun to irritate me now, but because this is not my first dance, I’m careful not to reveal any displeasure. Still, my inner core burns hot. All of his findings will be invalidated or buttressed by the final test—the one that could have been administered from the beginning to save us from our mutual entertainment on the sidewalks of Manhattan. Though I had drunk two margaritas three hours ago and had been sipping water ever since, the weasels of fear nonetheless begin to gnaw away at the back of my brain. How many drinks does it take to tint the blood past the wrong threshold? “Do I have a choice? Can I call someone?” “Yeah, you got a choice.” Murphy gestures forcefully, and I comply. “Either blow, or we haul you down to the station.” I close my eyes and blow. What happens after that is in some respects a blur, and in other respects etched with a chisel onto the tablet of my mind. Murphy has retreated to the cruisers behind us, and I can see him conferring with one of his partners. A police van has pulled up behind the cruisers. Murphy returns to me with a grin he can barely hide. “Good news, Professor,” he says, holding out his hand as if to congratulate me, “you passed the Breathalyzer.” He skips an extra beat like a comic onstage. “But there’s bad news too.” The hand which has been extended reaches suddenly for my wrist, twisting it sharply behind my back. “There’s a warrant out for your arrest.” Murphy mashes my cheek against the metal grate of the storefront in front of us, before slapping cold handcuffs on me. “What are you talking about? What did I do? Please!” My head spins with stars of puzzlement. But my protests land on deaf ears as the gears have been sprung into motion and more officers approach. One barks at me to “stay quiet and walk.” Another blue uniform marches me past the cruisers to the police van, palming my head like a basketball to shove me into the back. Yet another is on his walkie-talkie, buzzing with voices in the static. Murphy, an Irishman with a squat face, someone whose own family might have emigrated to America during the Great Famine, can’t unblink the mixture of joy and disdain from his eyes. His is the face I can call up on demand whenever I want to curdle my blood and smash something. “Well,” he says, turning to his partner, hocking a stringy loogie out onto the asphalt. “It’s always a good day when you can bag a sand n----r!” Those are the last words I would hear before the van doors clapped shut. The last time, besides in my dreams, that I would ever see Officer Murphy again. According to Daniel Bergner in the Atlantic, between 2004 and June 2012, 83 percent of the NYPD’s stop and frisk policy targeted blacks or Hispanics. Under Mayor Bloomberg, those numbers increased exponentially until, in 2010, the police recorded 686,000 stops, out of which only about 12 percent ended in arrest or summons. Donna Lieberman, the head of the New York Civil Liberties Union, has estimated that between 2002 and 2013, “innocent people were subjected to this by-no-means-minor intrusion more than 4.4 million times.” You do the math. My larger question is, what does being stigmatized as a criminal do to someone who is innocent? I can only speak my own answer, but I can’t help but wonder how, in the twenty-first century, this level of blatant racism still occurs in plain sight and what effect it might have on our collective health? Stop and frisk is not just bigoted; it is sloppy police work. In 1999, after the shooting of the unarmed Amadou Diallo, the New York State Attorney General’s office released a statistical analysis of the reported number of stops perpetuated by the infamous NYPD Street Crime Unit, which was disbanded in 2002. The study showed that the SCU stopped sixteen African Americans for every arrest made. In 2003, and again in 2017, the city settled further class action suits for their racist profiling policies. If it were the NYPD being arraigned, it might be subject to the penalty enhancement of being a persistent offender. But the larger calculus has more to do with the question of what it does to a statistically significant portion of the American population to be prejudged as criminal a priori, before a member of this population has even done one damn thing, and what effect that might have on larger sociopolitical, interpersonal, and economic conditions. Michelle Alexander lays out the facts in her book The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, and some of what she reveals should have us out protesting in the streets. The United States has 5 percent of the world’s population but nearly 25 percent of the world’s prisoners; more than China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea. There are more black men in prison, on probation, or on parole than there were slaves during the Civil War. From the 1970s to now, there has been an exponential increase in the prison population—much of this explosion due to drug arrests, a figure disproportionately skewed toward African Americans and Hispanic Americans. According to the Sentencing Project report on racial disparities in the United States criminal justice system, which was presented to the United Nations in 2013, “one of every three black American males born today can expect to go to prison in his lifetime.” That’s the living, breathing legacy of the civil rights movement? One in three? As James Baldwin put it in a radio conversation with Studs Terkel in 1961, “all you are ever told in this country about being black is that it is a terrible, terrible thing to be. Now, in order to survive this, you have to really dig down into yourself and recreate yourself, really, according to no image which yet exists in America. You have to impose, in fact—this may sound very strange—you have to decide who you are, and force the world to deal with you, not with its idea of you.” How few of us are blessed with Baldwin’s wisdom. I’m not. Far from it. In fact, it’s become clear to me over time that my own reactions, both conscious and impulsive, have been largely foolish and ill-advised. Yet I can no longer pretend that I am not complicit in the prison-industrial complex, having benefitted from its institutional racism for many more decades than I would come to suffer its punishments. How did America, land of the free, become the world’s leader in incarceration, and how did jails become so racialized? Early Puritanical society banished criminals into the wilderness and meted out sanguinary punishments as public spectacles, where the brandings, maiming, whippings, and executions were meant to be witnessed by the community as deterrents to aberrant behavior. There was no distinction between what was considered criminal and what was deemed sinful, and the law conflated the division between Church and State, considering all acts of deviance the work of the devil. It was not until the Quaker Reformers of the early nineteenth-century, the political left-wing of their time, that jails began to proliferate as a more civilized alternative to the barbarism of an earlier time. The Quakers thought that criminals could be redeemed and transformed through penance, religion, and labor. That early zeal for shaming and punishment never left the scene, but became institutionalized in these isolated, secret, surveilled spaces which the public could not access. Enter the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, and the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which, as documentary filmmaker Ava Duvernay argues, contains within its very language of liberation a justification for what was to come: “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.” That’s the ultimate get-out clause, a way for the disgruntled former plantation owners in America’s deep South to supplement the abolished institution of slavery with another that would replace the lost free labor. Each convict represented for the State a chance to make money, and so the convict lease system was born, an easy way to help rebuild a war-ravaged economy. Freed slaves could be criminalized under the “black codes,” ambiguous vagrancy or apprentice laws, where out of work men could be arrested, and where blacks needed to obtain a license from whites to practice their trade, else face a fine. The inability to pay this fine would conscript them again into servitude and allow their bodies to be loaned out to other states to work. These practices disenfranchised and denied African Americans equal protection under the law, restricted their movements, and prevented them from owning land or exercising their constitutional right to public education. It’s no coincidence, then, that the next explosion of the prison population came a century later, right on the heels of the Civil Rights movement. At the end of Jim Crow and segregation, what better way to re-inscribe racist policies but to start a “war on drugs” that disproportionately affected populations of color. Just as the left-wing Quakers of their era exacerbated certain social problems, so too did the “liberal” Democrats of the 1990s. Bill Clinton’s omnibus crime bill of 1994, signed into effect even as he was deregulating the financial industry, increased and further racialized the prison population by introducing such concepts as “super-predators,” “mandatory minimums,” “truth in sentencing,” and the federal “three strikes” policy. This led to the growth of privatized prisons and the notorious 100-to-1 sentencing disparity between crack and cocaine users, all of which delivered up more bodies of color for, in the words of Angela Davis, “profitable punishment.” Indeed, in Hillary Clinton’s own words, they had inmates, “African-American men in their thirties,” work as unpaid servants in the Governor’s Mansion in Arkansas in order to “keep down costs.” I’m not Black, even though there was little nuance or sophistication in Officer Murphy’s appraisal and arrest of me that evening. For him, dark skin was dark skin. He didn’t need much more than that to pull me over on the flimsiest of pretexts. But, as a matter of fact, as an Asian-American, I am part of the most successful demographic group in America (though even that monolithic notion lumps together communities such as Cambodian-, Laotian-, Bangladeshi-. Nepalese- and Burmese-Americans, who fall well below the median household income of all Americans). Likewise, there’s no question that the racialization and policing of our communities has been vastly different from that of African-American communities. In the past, Asian immigrants have been excluded from gaining entry into the U.S. and becoming citizens. They have even lost their personal property and been sent to internment camps, as Japanese-Americans were during World War II. But that’s vastly different from the history of segregation, police brutality, and systematic discrimination that African-Americans have endured for centuries. Still, I don’t need to be Black to parse the Supreme Court’s decision in the 1968 case of Terry v. Ohio: “In justifying the particular intrusion, the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion ... good faith on the part of the arresting officer is not enough.” Yet on the police reports made public about stop-and-frisk encounters, NYPD officers needed merely to check a box labeled “furtive movements,” “suspicious bulge,” or one implausibly labeled “other” to justify a frisking. I’m not Black, but, after that traffic stop, I understood just a tiny bit better what it was like to be so in America. I sued the city for racial discrimination and police misconduct, winning a modest settlement. But I had been slurred a “sand n----r” and wrongfully detained on an erroneous warrant in a city I once considered home. The effect on me was not readily apparent, but, in time, I would discover that a nameless fear had imperceptibly unhinged me. The next time I was arrested, I was not guiltless.

Police informed WGHP that the incident happened around 2:30 a.m. Dec. 5. “There were two different patrons with tables in there and somehow an argument started and then, from the argument, a fight began, and then the business owner tried to break things up and he was assaulted,” Winston-Salem Police Sgt. Kevin Bowers told the news station. According to Scotto di Frego’s account of the incident on the pizzeria Facebook page, he was still reeling from the attack the next day and working to figure out what exactly happened. After receiving dozens of supportive comments online, he posted a photo of his face, bruised and swollen, but healing. In the restaurant surveillance video submitted to news outlets, viewers can see Scotto di Frego attempt to speak to customers walking by him toward a group of people in the back of the restaurant. The video shows one man come up behind Scotto di Frego and hit him in the side of the head, causing him to fall into a booth. The same man appears to stomp on him once he has fallen down, the video shows. Following the incident, Scotto di Frego and his business partner decided to permanently close the restaurant early at night in response to violence in the pizzeria. “I’m sorry to announce this, but due to recent incidents in the store we will no longer be open late nights,” they wrote. Now, their restaurant will begin to close at 10 p.m. except for Saturday, when it will close at midnight. It will cost them money, the pizzeria told News & Record, but it’s not worth the risk. Merchants told the outlet that officers on downtown patrol are off by midnight, leaving a scarce law enforcement presence by the time late-night venues close. “It’s no secret that we can use more people,” Bowers, the longtime supervisor for the downtown bike patrol, told the News & Record. “Every department could.” Kira Boyd, spokesperson for the Winston-Salem Police Department, told McClatchy News that safety concerns for downtown business owners are a priority for the department. “We encourage citizens to report any crimes they witness in our city,” Boyd said. “We will be meeting with a group of business owners soon to discuss ways we can partner to keep their patrons and our citizens safe.” If citizens have any information about the incident, they are asked to call the Winston-Salem Police Department at 336-773-7700.

12/14/2021,"The constitutionality of Ocean City’s law banning women — and not men — from sunbathing topless could potentially go before the U.S. Supreme Court after the attorneys representing five women in the case petitioned the nation’s highest court earlier this month. The petitioners are asking the Supreme Court to review the Aug. 4 federal appeals court ruling, which determined that Ocean City's law is constitutional. This petition was filed Dec. 1, and the court has until Jan. 7 to respond, according to the U.S. Supreme Court docket. While the Supreme Court hears only a small percentage of cases petitioned, this move continues a new chapter in the ongoing debate over what is protecting “moral sensibility” or violating gender equality in Maryland’s largest beach town. In 2017, Ocean City passed a law banning only women from exposing their breasts in public. It came after one of the plaintiffs in the case, Chelsea Eline, contacted Ocean City police and said it was her right to go topless. Eline and four other women then filed a lawsuit against the town in 2018, claiming that the ordinance violated their constitutional rights. A federal judge first ruled in April 2020 that the town’s ordinance was legal and did not violate the U.S. Constitution's Equal Protection Clause, as the plaintiffs argued. Then, less than a month later, Eline and her fellow plaintiffs appealed the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals. LATEST: Ocean City's topless ban is upheld by appeals court MORE: Ocean City topless lawsuit: Appeals court weighs equal protection and moral sensibilities In August, a federal appeals court again affirmed Ocean City's right to ban women from going topless in the town. In this decision, Judge A. Marvin Quattlebaum Jr. wrote that Ocean City's elected leaders are within their rights to enact laws that protect public sensibilities. “The judicial legacy of justifying laws on the basis of the perceived moral sensibilities of the public is far from spotless. Some government action that we now rightly view as unconstitutional, if not immoral, has been justified on that basis,” Quattlebaum wrote. ""Even so, in this situation, protecting public sensibilities serves an important basis for government action."" The court denied the appellants' request to rehear the case on Sept. 2. Since that court upheld the lower court's ruling, and the plaintiffs once again lost their case, they're now hoping to take the question of constitutionality to the U.S. Supreme Court. The specific question that the petition asks is whether ""protecting traditional moral sensibilities"" — the overarching defense for the Ocean City ordinance — is an important governmental interest that a municipality can use to support what the petitioners consider a discriminatory gender-based classification. LEGAL NEWS: Lawsuit aims to block construction of biogas facility near Georgetown This latest move asks the court to declare that Ocean City's ordinance violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution ""because the discriminatory gender classification contained in the ordinance does not further an important governmental interest, and is not narrowly tailored to achieve its objective."" The court document further argues that the ordinance stems from ""longstanding discriminatory and sexist ideology in which women are viewed as inherently sexual objects without the agency to decide when they are sexual and when they are not.""

12/14/2021,"By Keith Coffman DENVER (Reuters) - A Colorado judge on Monday reluctantly sentenced a Texas truck driver to 110 years in prison following his conviction for vehicular homicide when his semi-trailer crashed into stopped traffic and killed four motorists along a mountain interstate. Rogel Lazaro Aguilera-Mederos, 26, was found guilty in October by a jury in Jefferson County, Colorado, of four homicide charges along with multiple counts of assault and reckless driving stemming from the April 2019 fiery crash. Jefferson County District Judge Bruce Jones said Colorado law required he impose the mandatory minimum sentences to all the counts Aguilera-Mederos was convicted of, but that he had ""no desire"" to send him to prison for life. ""If I had the discretion, it would not be my sentence,"" Jones said. Prosecutors argued at trial that Aguilera-Mederos knew his brakes were failing but drove past at least one runaway truck ramp as he descended the mountains along Interstate 70 west of Denver. He then recklessly weaved in and out of traffic before his trailer, which was hauling lumber, crashed into stopped traffic and burst into flames, triggering a 28-vehicle pile-up that killed four people and injured six, prosecutors said. Aguilera-Mederos told investigators his brakes failed and he tried to avoid hitting other vehicles after losing control. At Monday's hearing, Megan Harrison, the daughter of one of the people killed, Doyle Harrison, told the judge ""my dad was taken away from me."" ""A huge person in my life never came home,"" she said. When he addressed the court, Aguilera-Mederos wept as he begged the victims' families for forgiveness and asked the judge for leniency. ""I am not a criminal,"" he said. ""I never thought about hurting anyone in my entire life.""

Actress January Jones is getting into the Christmas spirit with a ton of new Instagram posts. First, The Mad Men star, 43, wore a bright red low-cut TA3 one-piece swimsuit paired with a cute pair of black cat-eye sunglasses in a recent Instagram post. And she gave a shout-out to Mrs. Claus in her caption. ""Still gonna rep 🤶🏻 in this heat,"" she captioned the pic. And her followers are loving it.

""Swipe for a Xmas gift at the end 🎅🏼"" she captioned the Instagram. To stay fit, January is a fan of yoga and Pilates. ""Two or three years ago I started doing barre classes, and after that I took regular private Pilates lessons. Then a friend told me about Lagree Pilates. I’ve been doing it two to four times a week for the past year now, and I’ve gained weight because I’ve put on muscle. I’ve gone up a size in clothes, but I feel like I look better naked,"" she told Shape in February 2020. In April 2021, she posted a series of pics of herself doing a poolside yoga workout, where she accomplished a full handstand. She loves the group class atmosphere, which pushes her to try harder. “Lagree is quite difficult, but I’ve found that it’s the only thing that really makes me feel stronger, and I’m loving it. The music is good and there’s always a different routine, so it doesn’t get boring. There are 10 of us in the class, and I like having women on both sides of me to push me,"" she has said. For nutrition, she relies on cooking at home. “I love to cook for my son and me. For dinner, we like salmon with french fries, and we make pasta frequently. We try to have lots of green veggies. We eat organic because I worry a lot about that for my kid. No antibiotics or hormones in meats is really important to me, and so is eating sustainable fish,"" she told Shape. And while she eats healthy, she also doesn't deprive herself. “I don’t deprive myself of anything. If I want something—steak, a bagel—I’ll eat it,"" she said. ""There’s no diet or strict set of rules."" Usually, she starts her morning with celery juice, coffee, and a banana, followed by a MacroBar. For lunch, she'll have a salad, soup, or a sandwich.

12/14/2021,"Hillary Clinton predicts that former President Donald Trump will again seek the White House in 2024. ""He seems to be setting himself up to do that,"" she told the ""Sunday Today"" host Willie Geist. Trump defeated Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, winning the Electoral College 304-227. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton — in an NBC interview that was released in its entirety Sunday — predicted that former President Donald Trump would seek the presidency in 2024 and said victory by him ""could be the end"" of US democracy. Clinton, who lost the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008 to Barack Obama before becoming the party's nominee in 2016, was defeated by Trump in what was seen as one of the biggest political upsets in modern political history. ""If I were a betting person right now, I'd say Trump is going to run again,"" she told the ""Sunday Today"" host Willie Geist. ""He seems to be setting himself up to do that, and if he's not held accountable, he gets to do it again."" ""I think that could be the end of our democracy,"" she said. ""Not to be too pointed about it, but I want people to understand that this could be a make-or-break point. If he or someone of his ilk were once again to be elected president, especially if he had a Congress that would do his bidding, you will not recognize our country."" Trump has flirted with a 2024 presidential bid since leaving the White House in January, but he has not yet made an official announcement of his plans. When Geist asked Clinton whether she ever had ""moments of responsibility or even guilt"" about Trump's tenure in the White House, she acknowledged having such feelings. ""Of course,"" she said. ""I tried to warn people. I tried to make the case that this was really dangerous — the people he was allied with, what they were saying, what he might do. I do think but for Jim Comey and the stunt he pulled 10 days before the election, I would have won."" Comey, who at the time was the director of the FBI, sent a letter to Congress on October 28, 2016, to announce that the law-enforcement agency was renewing its investigation into her private email server. Clinton and many top Democrats have long argued that the development — less than two weeks before Election Day — swayed enough independent voters into Trump's camp to help him defeat Clinton. In her ""Today"" interview, Clinton remarked on Trump's brand of politics. ""I feel terrible about not stopping him and the people around him, but I feel like now everybody can see for themselves what kind of leader he is,"" she said. Clinton also reflected on Trump's base of supporters, noting that he was trying to install loyalists in key election posts across the US. ""Clearly, there were people who liked what they saw, despite what I see as the real dangers to our country,"" she said. ""They turned out and voted for him. And he's trying to get it set up so that will happen again for him, even as he loses, as he did twice the popular vote."" In the 2016 presidential election, Trump beat Clinton in the Electoral College (304 to 227, with seven electors defecting), but Clinton edged him out in the popular vote, 48% to 46%, securing nearly 2.9 million more votes than the Republican. Clinton has been a fixture in national politics for generations, from her days as first lady and her tenure as a US senator representing New York to her time as the country's top diplomat and as one of the most influential figures in the Democratic Party. She said the prospect of Trump reentering the Oval Office presented the country with a clear choice. ""Are we going to give in to all these lies and this disinformation and this organized effort to undermine our rule of law and our institutions, or are we going to stand up to it?"" she asked. Last week, in a video for her new MasterClass lesson called ""The Power of Resilience,"" Clinton for the first time shared the speech that she would have given at the Javits Center in Manhattan had she won the presidency.
