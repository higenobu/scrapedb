3/16/2022,"An M.D. candidate explained why you should never use those automatic hand dryers in public bathrooms. TikToker @madmedicine is all about sharing “dope medical facts” to make health information more accessible. He recently shared a video about how those super convenient, contactless hand dryers actually don’t stop the spread of bacteria. They make it worse. Shop all of Christian Cowan’s high-fashion looks from his In The Know cover shoot: The medical student reacted to a popular TikTok trend where people use Dyson hand dryers to curl their hair. “I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but those hand dryers in public restrooms are extremely disgusting,” he explained. “There have been actual studies done on those hand dryers to see if they spread bacteria. Spoiler alert: They tend to spread more bacteria compared to just towels.” According to the Harvard Health blog, a 2018 study by the University of Connecticut and Quinnipiac University found that exposure to hot hand dryers exponentially grew bacteria colonies within a matter of seconds. “Every time a lidless toilet is flushed, it aerosolizes a fine mist of microbes. This fecal cloud may disperse over an area as large as 6 square meters (65 square feet),” Harvard Health stated. This means that each time someone flushes a toilet, particles of fecal bacteria spread through the air. When the bacteria comes in contact with a hot hand dryer, it multiplies. The best way to dry your hands and prevent bacteria from surviving on them is to use a paper towel.

3/16/2022,"The prime ministers of Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovenia traveled by train to Kyiv on Tuesday to show support for Ukraine as Russian attacks on the capital city intensified. Poland’s Mateusz Morawiecki, Petr Fiala of the Czech Republic and Janez Jansa of Slovenia are the first foreign leaders to travel to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion began three weeks ago. Their visit comes on the same day a series of strikes hit a residential neighborhood in Kyiv, killing at least four people, Ukrainian officials said. ""At such breakthrough times for the world, it is our duty to be where history is forged,” Morawiecki said in a Facebook post. “Because it's not about us, but about the future of our children who deserve to live in a world free from tyranny."" Jaroslaw Kaczynski, Poland's de facto leader, also joined them. ""The purpose of the visit is to confirm the unequivocal support of the entire European Union for the sovereignty and independence of Ukraine,"" Fiala said in a statement. According to the Associated Press, the leaders were expected to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been calling on Western leaders for support as Ukraine tries to defend itself from Russia’s assault. In a video message posted online earlier Tuesday, Zelensky called on Russian soldiers to surrender. “On behalf of the Ukrainian people, I give you a chance,” he said, according to an English translation of the address shared by his office. “If you surrender to our forces, we will treat you the way people are supposed to be treated — as people, decently.” According to the United Nations, at least 691 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since Feb. 24, when Russia's military invasion began. And more than 3 million people have fled the war-torn country, with many refugees crossing the border into Poland. Meanwhile, President Biden is reportedly considering the possibility of traveling to Europe in the coming weeks to show support for Ukraine and reassure America’s allies in the region.

3/16/2022,"Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov said Vladimir Putin would destroy Elon Musk in a fight. It comes after Musk challenged Russia's leader to ""single combat"" to decide Ukraine's fate. Putin loyalist Kadyrov joined in the macho posturing in a lengthy Telegram post on Monday. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov responded to Elon Musk's surreal offer to fight President Vladimir Putin in single combat over the fate of Ukraine, arguing that Musk would face swift defeat. Kadyrov, a top Putin ally who rules Russia's quasi-autonomous Chechnya region, posted at length to say Putin would destroy Musk in a fight. ""I would not advise you to compete with Putin,"" he wrote on Telegram. It came after the Tesla chief made the challenge on Twitter on Monday, challenging Putin to ""single combat"" over Ukraine. Kadyrov seemed amused in his response and offered Musk some ways to get stronger before facing Putin. Both Ukrainian and Russian news sources have reported Chechen soldiers fighting in Ukraine, and Kadyrov has claimed to be on the battlefield himself. Kadyrov noted Putin's qualifications in judo, but said this was not the main reason Musk would lose. Musk, he said was merely a ""businessman and Twitter blogger"" compared to Putin, a ""world politician, strategist, a scourge of the West and the US."" Putin, he concluded, ""would look unsportsmanlike beating a weaker opponent."" Instead, he said, Musk should undergo training at one of his Special Forces academies as well as ""Fight Club Akhmat"" — a chain of Chechen boxing clubs he founded and named after his father, former Chechen ruler Akhmat Kadyrov. Kadyrov is one of Putin's firmest loyalists. Putin formally handed Kadyrov the leadership of Chechnya in 2011 after Kadyrov spent several years as the region's prime minister. His personal fighting units have earned a bloodthirsty reputation. While Putin has embraced that image for his own propaganda purposes, an analysis from think tank the New Lines Institute said ""their operational effectiveness has not lived up to the hype."" In the invasion of Ukraine, Kadyrov has repeatedly called for harsher attacks, frustrated by Russia's lumbering advance. On Sunday, he claimed to be near Kyiv with his soldiers, without providing evidence. Kadyrov's hyper-masculine posturing is underpinned by brutal rule. According to Human Rights Watch, he has led a crackdown on LGBTQ rights and is known for extensive use of torture, forced disappearances, and extrajudicial killings, all tolerated by Putin.

3/16/2022,"LVIV, Ukraine (AP) — They are idealists who abandoned their jobs for the battlefields of Ukraine, looking for a cause or simply to fight. The Ukrainian president’s call for foreign volunteers to join an international brigade to help bolster his country’s defense with a new layer of resistance to Russia’s invasion is for now a ragtag army. Recruits say they are often waiting for weapons and training, leaving them feeling exposed. “Pure hell: fire, shouting, panic. And a lot more bombs and missiles.” That is how Swedish volunteer Jesper Söder described Sunday’s attack on Yavoriv, the military training base in western Ukraine pounded by Russian missiles that killed 35 people, according to Ukrainian authorities. Russia said the death toll was much higher. Söder said he led a group of foreigners including Scandinavians, British and Americans out of the base and back across the nearby Polish border. He told The Associated Press by phone from Krakow, Poland, that he said he didn’t know how many foreign volunteers were being trained at the base but estimated they were in the hundreds. Unlike Söder, who fought alongside Kurdish fighters in Syria against Islamic State group militants, many of the volunteers at Yavoriv had no previous military training, he said. Foreigners — some of whom have never handled a firearm yet but are ready to die — have arrived in Ukraine from other European countries, the United States and elsewhere. They are hoping to get equipped, instructed and made battle-ready. But some arrive to discover that there are no weapons, protective gear or proper training in a multilingual force short on organization and breeding a sense of chaos. Threats by Russia to target what it calls foreign “mercenaries,” as it said it did at the Yavoriv base, increase the level of risk. “It’s chaotic right now. It’s disorganized, and you can get yourself in trouble very quickly if you’re not with a sensible switched-on group of people,” said Matthew Robinson, a British man from the northern England county of Yorkshire who had been living in southern Spain. Robinson and several other volunteer fighters were interviewed this weekend on the outskirts of Lviv, where foreign fighers are receiving training and instruction. A recent arrival, Robinson is remaining cautious as he tries to sort things out. He said that there are “multiple legions, lots of false promises, lots of misinformation.” In addition, there is a “massive language barrier” and “a lot of people here who haven’t fired weapons.” Russia’s threats to target what it calls “mercenaries” compounds the dangers facing foreign fighters. Russia has claimed it killed 180 “mercenaries” in Sunday’s training base attack, and Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Monday that the Russian forces will show “no mercy for mercenaries wherever they are on the territory of Ukraine.” The Russian military is tracking foreign fighters’ movements and will strike again, he said. Söder's account of the attack on the training base suggested it was not an indiscriminate strike. Söder said the bombing of the base was different from anything he had experienced. “They knew exactly what to hit. They knew exactly where our weapons storage was. They knew exactly where the administration building was. They hit the nail on the head with all their missiles,” he told the AP. Jericho Skye, 26, a Montana native who served in the U.S. Army military police, was relieved he based himself in Kyiv, the capital, far from the attack in the west, all the more so because he was awaiting weapons at a makeshift base. He keeps alive hope that arms soon will be distributed and his belief that Ukrainians are doing their best in a dire situation. “We’re pretty upset that we’re in the middle of a combat zone with small arms fire on the road, bombs being dropped almost every day and we haven’t been given our weapons yet just because of bureaucracy and paperwork,” he said. Skye spoke in a telephone call from Paris from what he described as a makeshift collection post for foreign fighters in Kyiv, which he reached last week, making his way there a day after arriving in Ukraine. “This is my first war,” Skye said. He came to Ukraine “to help protect,” not “do logistics,” he said, motivated by images of innocent civilians being targeted. And when he “saw no other countries were going to be able to reinforce Ukrainian troops, I felt a moral obligation to join the fighting,” he added. NATO nations have ruled out direct combat and air defense that Ukraine is pleading for, with leaders saying that could trigger a third world war. “It’s just them against the entire Russian military,” Skye said, noting Moscow’s call for war-hardened mercenaries from Syria to beef up its own ranks. “It’s a little disorganized. Its nobody’s fault,” he added. “They weren’t really expecting to be invaded, be thrown into a war,” he said. But death is not on his radar. “I’m very keenly aware of the situation,” But he added, “I’m going to do my very best to come home.” President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the creation of a foreign defense legion in late February, apparently surprising everyone, including embassies tasked with lending a hand. It wasn't clear how many people from across the globe have joined Ukraine’s international brigade. Zelenskyy said at one point that there were 16,000. The figure, which would now be outdated, couldn't be confirmed, but based on interviews in Ukraine and in some European capitals, a motley volunteer war effort is shaping up. Skye said volunteers from all points of the globe were with him in Kyiv, but wouldn't give a number, calling that “sensitive information.” En route to the Ukraine battlefields was Tristan Lombardo, a 22-year-old from Evansville, Illinois. “I feel like it’s the right thing to do, and that’s the best way to get your passions, in life,” he said in an interview Monday at the Polish border. “If it’s a passion, it’s a passion that I’m willing to die for,” Lombardo said, adding that he was nervous but not fearful. There was clear evidence that at least some Ukrainian embassies were overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of foreigners for Ukraine’s cause. In Paris, Ukrainian volunteers, including students, stood on the sidewalk to advise would-be fighters arriving from Bordeaux, Rouen and elsewhere in France to submit an electronic form. A 27-year-old New York state “relatively successful” business owner and former paratrooper in the Israeli military told the AP on the Polish border that he talked directly with Ukrainian army officials. He said “they got overwhelmed,” especially by those with no previous training. He identified himself only as Alexander, saying he hadn’t informed his parents of his plans to fight but signed up because, as a former paratrooper, he felt an “absolute responsibility” to help people of Ukraine. His “cue,” he said, was seeing rabbis drafted into the army and given AK-47s. Saving democracy is among top motives often cited by would-be foreign fighters, and some in place. But saving Ukraine has also become an attractive cause for the far right, neo-Nazis and white supremacists, providing a chance to fight. Recruiting chats on the encrypted Telegram messaging app are run by the Azov Regiment, popular with neo-Nazis and white supremacists, and American neo-Nazis work to recruit for Azov, the respected SITE Intelligence Group says. Azov Regiment originated as a far-right paramilitary unit and is now a subset of the Ukrainian military, according to SITE. A Chicago police officer who quit his job to join Zelenskyy’s defense brigade has high-minded motives for what he sees as a noble cause. Harrison Jozefowicz, who spent five years in the U.S. Army, sees himself, firstly, as a “facilitator.” “There are war crimes being committed here and refugees fleeing in the millions. And I know that I am needed here more right now” than at the Chicago Police Department, he said in an interview on the outskirts of Lviv. He conceded that his family “thought I was a little crazy.” His Task Force Yankee Ukraine, on Facebook, seeks to get Americans into Ukraine safely. While 90% of respondents have military training, “we’re not turning anybody away right now,” he said, including mechanics or doctors with needed skills. Still, British citizen Matthew Robinson stressed caution for foreigners eager to help the war effort on the ground. “If any single person was thinking of coming here, organize yourself into groups and set yourself some limits” and seek information before arriving, Robinson said. “Because you can be railroaded into a legion and sent to the front line very quickly,” he said. He added, “Even though you’ve got the best of intentions to help people, you could basically be cannon fodder.” ——- Elaine Ganley reported from Paris. Karl Ritter in Berlin, Jan M.
