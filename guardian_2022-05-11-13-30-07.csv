5/11/2022,"While it makes economic and political sense to suggest, as Anthony Albanese has, that the minimum wage, and indeed most wages, rise in line with the rate of inflation, Scott Morrison has suggested such a move would be “reckless and dangerous”. What’s far more dangerous and reckless is letting real wages and consumer spending fall just as he is trying to wind back public spending in the economy. There are no easy choices facing Australian policy makers at the moment, but cutting the real wages of millions of Australians would have to be one of the worse ones. Ironically, while high inflation is bad news for the budgets of 10 million Australian households, it’s good news for the bottom line of the commonwealth budget. While rapidly rising prices for groceries, coffee, petrol and building supplies mean tough choices are being made around Australia’s kitchen tables, those same price rises mean government revenue from the GST are set to surge. Inflation is even better at boosting commonwealth income tax revenues. Economists like to distinguish between what happens to your “nominal” wages (which refers to the number of dollars that get deposited in your account each fortnight) and what happens to your “real” wages (which refers to your spending power, or how much stuff you can actually buy with your nominal wages). If the prices of the things you normally buy all went up by 5% and your wages also went up by 5% then economists would say your nominal wages had risen 5% but your real wage hadn’t changed at all. But if your wages rose by 3% and the price of the things you buy went up by 5% then economists would say your real wage has fallen even though there is more money getting deposited into your bank account. Unfortunately, that’s what is currently happening to millions of Australians – and right now the rate of inflation is going up at more than twice the rate of wage growth. It gets worse. When the Australian Bureau of Statistics calculates the consumer price index (CPI) it measures the monthly change in the price of goods ranging from baked beans to soap to petrol to new TVs. And while the CPI takes account of the fact that most people spend a lot more on petrol than they do on baked beans, they deliberately leave out a few things that aren’t considered to be “consumer goods” – things like the price of buying a house (unless it’s a new build) and the interest paid on the mortgage. So, if you think that last month’s CPI figure meant that the “cost of living” went up by 5.1%, keep in mind that figure didn’t even include the major expense of millions of people – putting a roof over your head. And then there’s tax. I for one am all for collecting tax fairly and spending it on people based on the services we need rather than what seats a political party wants to win. Indeed, I’m so into taxes that I think Australia needs to collect more tax and spend more money lowering the cost of living by providing the kind of free health, education and childcare services that are so common in Europe. But even I, with my well-known enthusiasm for paying more tax, have major concerns about the fairness of what inflation is about to do to our tax system. While it’s bad enough that real wages are falling for millions of Australians, and it’s even worse for those with mortgages than the official CPI data suggests, to add insult to multiple injuries, a lot of Australians are about to pay a higher average rate of tax this year even though their real incomes have fallen. Australia has what’s called a “progressive income tax system” where, as people’s (nominal) income rises, so too does their average tax rate. For example, while incomes below $18,200 a year are tax free, as wages rise above that level so too does the tax rate, starting at 19 cents in every dollar earned over the tax-free threshold and rising further still, in three steps, up to 45 cents in the dollar for income over $180,000 a year. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But while most Australians, and most countries around the world, SUPPORT a progressive income tax system, when there is a sudden burst of inflation most people will end up paying a higher tax rate – even though their real wages have fallen. It all comes down to the distinction between nominal wages and real wages. Because the tax system has fixed income thresholds if someone earning $45,000 a year sees their cost of living grow by 5% and their wages grow by 5% then you might think they’d be no worse off, but because incomes below $45,000 are taxed at 19 cents in the dollar and those above $45,000 are taxed at 30 cents, a 5% wage rise to cover a 5% increase in the cost of living would mean they would pay an extra $247 per year in tax. No wonder people are grumpy. Despite being “over it” we are not through the pandemic yet. Hundreds of people are still dying each week, the number of people on unemployment benefits is much higher now than it was in 2019, and while inflation will mean people will finally see some nominal wage growth, in real terms (that is, inflation-adjusted terms) millions of Australians are already worse off than they were last year. Just as the official definition of unemployment conceals the real lack of work in Australia, data on nominal wage growth and nominal GDP conceal what is really happening to people’s standard of living. But while inflation eats into the real wages of most Australians, it simultaneously boosts GST and income tax revenues for the government. It’s no accident that so many people don’t believe the story of prosperity that Scott Morrison is preaching. People with falling real incomes facing rising prices, rising interest rates and rising average tax rates have little to celebrate. No wonder the polls say there is a mood for change, and no wonder the share market is nervous.

5/11/2022,"Labor has been arguing for months that the price of everything has been going up, except your wages. But the debate over the minimum wage really took off on Tuesday when Anthony Albanese endorsed a specific pay rise: 5.1%, to keep up with inflation. Now the government is accusing Labor of policy on the run and an “unprecedented” intervention in an independent wage-setting process. Is that true? Every year the Fair Work Commission holds the annual wage review, receiving submissions from unions, employers, governments and other stakeholders. By mid-year, the commission’s minimum wage panel orders an increase in the national minimum wage and the safety net in industrial awards, a decision which more than 2 million workers rely on to set their wage. Labor has promised that, if elected, it will put in a submission to the review backing an increase in the minimum wage. The Coalition government regularly puts in a submission that takes note of economic conditions but doesn’t advocate for a pay rise of a particular size. In fact, unions and Labor believe the government tries to hold back pay rises, by submitting, as they did this year, that low-paid work is an important feature of the economy. On Monday the Australian Council of Trade Unions upped their proposed increase from 5% to 5.5%, due to surging inflation. Albanese was asked on Tuesday morning if he backed the unions’ call for 5.5%, which he declined to do. Later, at a press conference, he was asked if he backed 5.1% to keep up with inflation, and replied: “Absolutely.” The government went on the attack. The financial services minister, Jane Hume, said: What’s wrong is Anthony Albanese weighing in on the independent Fair Work Commission’s decision as to what it should do with minimum wages. That would be unprecedented. No government should weigh in on the Fair Work Commission’s decision. Scott Morrison accused Albanese of being a “loose unit” who “just runs off at the mouth” – by answering the question he was asked. Morrison also argued against 5.1% by claiming that Albanese “pretends to give with one hand, and then he sees interest rates and cost of living rises take it all back from you”. When pushed, Morrison wouldn’t say how much he’d like to see the minimum wage rise by, or whether it would be inappropriate if the FWC ordered 5.1%, just that it was “not wise” for politicians to have a view. No. Labour law academic, Prof Andrew Stewart, told Guardian Australia that although it has “become the norm” that government submissions are general in nature, the Labor governments of the late 1980s and early 1990s put in agreed submissions as part of the Accord with unions, which all nominated pay rises. Tim Harcourt, who ran minimum wage cases for the ACTU in the 1990s and went on to serve on the FWC minimum wage panel, told Guardian Australia that in Accord era pay reviews, governments did make submissions that “often had numbers in it” on the preferred size of pay rises. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning As parliamentary library archives show, even the Howard government put in submissions with a specific number on their preferred pay rise, often countering union claims for $20 more a week with more modest calls for $8 or $10. “The government intervenes in the commission all the time to put a view on wages – as they did in the only successful equal remuneration case in the social and community services sector,” Stewart said. “Even in the national wage case, specific numbers were the norm.” Jim Stanford, the director of the Centre for Future Work, said it was “not at all unprecedented to suggest that the national minimum wage should at least keep up with consumer price inflation”. “To the contrary, it is rare for the national minimum wage to increase by less than the rate of inflation,” he told Guardian Australia. “In the last 20 years it has only happened twice that the increase in the national minimum wage was smaller than the inflation in the preceding financial year.” Stewart said: “There is nothing improper about it – it is still the decision of the independent umpire.” Labour law academic, Anthony Forsyth, agreed that it was “unexceptional” for the government or opposition to advocate for a pay rise, and the commission takes a “list of factors” into account when deciding. Harcourt said “it’s a free country”, and both the government and opposition are entitled to a view. “The commission understands. It’s not the same thing as the treasurer ringing up and saying ‘you must not give them 5%’ – that would be interference.” The Reserve Bank has projected that inflation will reach 5.5% by mid-year, 6% by year’s end, before falling to 4.25% by mid-2023. So, a pay rise of 5.1% would amount to a real pay cut for half the year but be greater than inflation by the middle of next year (hopefully). Stanford said there was “nothing unprecedented about nominal wages growing at 5.1%”. “In fact, average weekly earnings grew faster than that three times during the decade from 2000 through 2010 (2003, 2005, and 2010). “Suggesting that it is unusual for wages to grow 5.1% in a year, especially in a tight labour market, just shows how far the goalposts have shifted during the last decade. Annual wage growth of 4-5% was once typical, and in fact desired. Now it is seen as a portent of doom.” It is neither unprecedented nor an interference with the independence of the commission to propose a minimum wage rise of a particular size, though it hasn’t happened in more recent years. As to whether 5.1% would be responsible – that will be for the FWC to decide. Ironically, the Coalition rubbishing 5.1% as a potential cause of further inflation prejudges what is affordable and responsible – which is exactly what they have accused Albanese of having done.",News/Australia news,Factcheck: is Albanese’s backing of a 5.1% minimum wage rise an ‘unprecedented’ intervention?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/11/factcheck-is-albaneses-backing-of-a-51-minimum-wage-rise-an-unprecedented-intervention
5/11/2022,"Victoria is set to become the first Australian state or territory to ban the Nazi swastika, with a leading anti-hate campaigner describing the legislation introduced to state parliament as history-making. Under the Summary Offences Amendment (Nazi Symbol Prohibition) Bill 2022, it will be a criminal offence for a person to intentionally display the Nazi swastika, also known as the Hakenkreuz, in public. Doing so could lead to fines of almost $22,000, 12 months’ imprisonment or both, once the legislation comes into effect. In announcing the landmark reform on Wednesday, the attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, said it will send a clear message that Nazi and neo-Nazi ideology has no place in Victoria. “The Nazi symbol glorifies one of the most hateful ideologies in history – its public display does nothing but cause further pain and division,” she said. “As a government we want to do all we can to stamp out hate and give it no room to grow.” She said the legislation will come into effect a year after passing, to allow for an community education campaign to raise awareness of the origins of the religious and cultural swastika, its importance to the Buddhist, Hindu and Jain communities and its distinction from the Nazi symbol. The bill does not prohibit the display of the swastika in such religious and cultural contexts. “We do know that the swastika is a symbol of peace, love and acceptance for the Hindu, Buddhist and Jain communities and is a really important symbol for their faith,” Symes said. There will also be “appropriate exemptions” for the Nazi symbol to be used including for educational and historical purposes, she added. Chairman of the Anti-Defamation Commission, Dr Dvir Abramovich, welcomed the announcement, having campaigned for five years to outlaw public displays of the Nazi swastika. “This is a day for the history books, this is an uplifting and triumphant moment for every Victorian and it’s a thunderous blow to the solar plexus of the neo-Nazi movement here in Victoria who would love nothing more than to put people like myself in the gas chambers and who dream of an Australian Hitler and Fourth Reich,” he told reporters. “This is a day in which we honour the six million Jews exterminated by the Nazis and the millions of others, it’s a day in which we honour the Holocaust survivors who made Victoria their home and pay tribute to the brave diggers who sacrificed their lives to defeat the Third Reich.” Abramovich said there was a “Nazi swastika epidemic” in Victoria. “For a Holocaust survivor, to see a Nazi swastika, graffitied or vandalised, it is as threatening as being faced with a gun. It tears a hole through their heart,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning President of the Jewish Community Council of Victoria, Daniel Aghion, said antisemitic incidents in Australia have increased 37% this year when compared to last year. “We can’t stop everything. Some people will do it simply because they are malicious and the question of a very large fine or the risk of imprisonment may not even stop them, but it is important that we lead and it is important that we educate,” he said. The legislation follows recommendations of a parliamentary inquiry that was set up in 2019, just months after the government was powerless to stop a neo-Nazi music festival from taking place. In January 2020, the government was also unable to stop a family from flying a Nazi flag above their home in the small town of Beulah. Symes said the government may consider banning other Nazi symbols in the future. Deputy Liberal leader, David Southwick, said the opposition would support the legislation, having called for a ban of the Nazi swastika for two years. “Today is the proudest moment in my career in politics to be able to see – finally – the ban on the Nazi swastika, something that is long overdue,” he said.",News/Australia news,Victoria to become first state to ban the Nazi swastika,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/11/victoria-to-become-first-state-to-ban-the-nazi-swastika
5/11/2022,"New Zealand will fully reopen to the world two months earlier than originally planned, prime minister Jacinda Ardern has announced as part of a wider shake-up to immigration settings. The country swiftly closed the border in March 2020 to prevent the arrival of Covid-19. It has just started reopening to some non-New Zealand citizens and residents over the past few months – beginning with Australians and followed by travellers from 60 visa-waiver countries. From 11.59pm on 31 July, tourists and visa-holders from the rest of the world will also be allowed back for the first time in over two years. The original date had been set for October, but the government long maintained the opening could be brought forward if it was deemed safe to do so. “This will be welcome news for families, businesses and our migrant communities,” Ardern said on Wednesday. “It also provides certainty and good preparation time for airlines and cruise ship companies planning a return to New Zealand in the peak spring and summer seasons.” The border announcement is part of a suite of reforms to immigration settings, including streamlining immigration pathways to attract skilled workers back to the country, extending visas for migrants already in the country, allowing cruise ships and international students to return and new settings that will help New Zealand move away from its reliance on low-wage, low-skill migrant labour. The prime minister, who is isolating at home after her partner tested positive for Covid-19, announced the reforms via video link as part of her pre-budget speech. She also reflected on her recent travels, the war in Ukraine, inflation and promoted the government’s vision for a stable economic future. The budget will be announced on 19 May and will help set the political scene as the country heads towards a 2023 election. “We have come through the Covid shock better than almost anywhere in the developed world. Our economy is one of the strongest in the world,” Ardern said. Now it was time to reconnect with the globe, she said. “New Zealand is in demand and now fully open for business.” The announcement comes a month after warnings the country is at risk of losing high-skilled workers, with government documents estimating 50,000 New Zealanders are poised to leave over the next year. Ardern said reopening New Zealand’s borders will help relieve “urgent skills shortages”. A key part of the immigration reforms is the “Green List” of hard-to-fill jobs in sectors including construction, engineering, health and technology. The government will aim to attract workers to fill those roles with incentives and a new streamlined application process, the immigration minister, Kris Faafoi, said. “New Zealand cannot return to pre-pandemic trends that saw us overly reliant on growing numbers of lower-skilled workers and resulted in the increased exploitation of migrants,” Faafoi said. New Zealand has been shown to have the heaviest reliance on temporary migrant workers in the OECD, Ardern added. “I want to be clear, migrants shape our society for the better in so many ways,” she said. “But we have a duty of care to everyone, that as we reopen our borders, we do so with a plan in place that means we learn the lessons of the past.” The government said it will also increase local skills through trades training and apprenticeships.",News/World news,New Zealand to fully reopen borders for first time since Covid pandemic started,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/new-zealand-to-fully-reopen-borders-for-first-time-since-covid-pandemic-started
5/11/2022,"Labor’s candidate for Reid is demanding an apology from Liberal MP Fiona Martin, claiming she has either confused her with another Asian Australian political aspirant or misled voters. In a debate between Martin and her Labor rival Sally Sitou on 2GB radio, Martin sensationally claimed that “Kristina Keneally kicked you out of Fowler too” in an apparent reference to Keneally winning preselection over Vietnamese Australian lawyer Tu Le in Fowler. In a heated exchange, Martin asked Sitou where she grew up, drawing a comparison between the Chinese Australian candidate who grew up in Cabramatta, and herself. “I grew up in Reid,” Martin said. “I went to school at Five Dock and Strathfield.” Sitou then asked “Where do you live?”, prompting Martin to say she had “deep roots” in Reid but she lives “very close by”. Martin rents in Ryde, in the neighbouring electorate of Bennelong. Sitou said she “didn’t want to raise this but I chose to live in this electorate because I love the community”. Martin countered that Sitou had moved to Reid because she “found an opportunity” and “couldn’t run in Fowler”. “Kristina Keneally kicked you out of Fowler too.” Sitou said Martin was “just making things up”. “That’s how ridiculous this debate has gotten. I’m sorry your listeners have had to listen to that.” Sitou later tweeted that she had “never sought to run for Fowler”. Earlier today in a candidates’ debate, my opponent Fiona Martin accused me of having previously contested preselection in Fowler. I have never sought to run for Fowler. I live in Reid, my son goes to school in Reid, and I am excited by the opportunity to represent my community. “My opponent either has me confused for a different Asian-Australian, or she is deliberately misleading people.” My opponent either has me confused for a different Asian-Australian, or she is deliberately misleading people.Either way, she should apologise. In comments to Guardian Australia, Martin denied having confused Sitou for Le. “Sally grew up in Fowler. Keneally reportedly declined Reid and went for Fowler. I think it makes sense to want to represent the area you grew up in or where you have a long association. Sally’s association with Reid is less than three years total.” Martin cited news reports in 2018 suggesting Sitou could run for the state seat of Cabramatta. Le was backed in Fowler by retiring Labor MP Chris Hayes, but lost preselection to Keneally in late 2021 after the Labor senator opted to contest a lower house seat because Deborah O’Neill secured a higher spot on the Senate ticket. Le was critical of the decision, arguing that Keneally’s preselection was a “missed opportunity” to properly represent Fowler, a culturally diverse electorate in Sydney’s south-west.",News/Australia news,Liberal MP Fiona Martin denies mixing up Asian Australian candidates in debate with Sally Sitou,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/11/liberal-mp-fiona-martin-denies-mixing-up-asian-australian-candidates-in-debate-with-sally-sitou
