5/3/2022,"Energy giant AGL and its new biggest shareholder, Mike Cannon-Brookes, have traded barbs over the future of Australia’s largest power generator after the billionaire raided the share registry in a last-minute bid to stop the company’s planned demerger. Cannon-Brookes late on Monday surprised the market by announcing his family company Grok Ventures had snared 11.28% of AGL. On Tuesday he warned splitting into a generator and retailing arm would not only destroy shareholder value by clinging on to ailing coal-fired power plants but would also be “globally irresponsible” because of the ongoing emissions by Australia’s biggest single polluter. The co-founder of tech services firm Atlassian said his aim was to muster a 25% shareholder rejection of the demerger plan by the 15 June vote, saying that the initial response had been positive. “Larger shareholders that we had talked to beforehand and a whole lot of smaller shareholders … who are probably pretty aligned anyway have been super supportive,” Cannon-Brookes said. He said the recent soaring in wholesale power prices – caused in part by breakdowns of coal plants including units at AGL’s Loy Yang A power station – underscored the need to accelerate the shift to renewables because of their zero-cost fuel. Wind, solar and hydro presently supply about a third of the grid’s electricity. “I believe there’s a far more positive and bright future for AGL leaning into the transition and being a meaningful participant in that transition,” Cannon-Brookes said. “And that requires keeping the company together.” The coal plants – Liddell and Bayswater in New South Wales and Victoria’s Loy Yang A – will shut down anyway. A combined AGL would be better able to manage their exits, including for the thousands of employees affected, he said. “Demerging AGL is a terrible outcome for the workers because when they do shut down – which they will – it will be brutal because it will be like driving a car into a wall,” Cannon-Brookes said. Cannon-Brookes teamed up with Canadian asset manager Brookfield in February to take over all of AGL. The company rejected their revised offer of $8.25 a share that valued the company at $8.5bn including debt. This time around Brookfield is not involved. AGL’s shareholders were initially cool on the intervention. The company’s shares were down 2.8% for the day in early afternoon trade to $8.38. In a statement to the ASX on Tuesday, AGL said its board had considered the share grab, and advised shareholders to “take no action” that would stop the demerger of the company into a generator arm, Accel Energy, and a retail arm, AGL Australia. The board “continues to believe that AGL’s proposed demerger is in the best interests of AGL shareholders as it creates the potential to maximise growth in the value of shares”, the statement said. It lists three reasons, including that the current plan gives each of the new companies “the freedom to pursue individual strategies and growth initiatives”. “AGL remains committed to progressing the proposed demerger with a view to achieving implementation by 30 June 2022 and a responsible transition of Australia’s energy system,” it said. In a separate statement, AGL announced a $2bn partnership with Global Infrastructure Partners that would help accelerate renewable energy projects under a demerged Accel Energy. About 2.7 gigawatts of “quality” renewables will result of the arrangement that hinges on the demerger proceeding. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning AGL’s chief executive, Graeme Hunt, said that today’s announcement had “always been timed for now” and was not related to the Cannon-Brookes foray. “We’ve been working on for six months plus, a competitive international process,” Hunt said. “We just finalised various approvals in the last little while.” Hunt said Cannon-Brookes had said a lot about what he intended to do with AGL in terms of the faster closure on fossil-fuel generation. “But by his admission, he does not have a plan,” Hunt said. “The company has been working on this restructuring and looking at other alternatives for over a year,” he said. “We’ve considered all sorts of other options and those options are talked about in the scheme booklet [sent out to shareholders before the demerger vote].” Hunt warned that “just wishing a faster decarbonisation pathway means without the national energy market being ready for that electricity supply and electricity pricing” Cannon-Brookes’ plan would force the company’s glide plan out of fossil fuels “into a tailspin”. “That’s disastrous for electricity prices,” Hunt said. “The lights will go out and it will not be recoverable.” “We’ve got a pathway,” he said. “It’s the right one that we have worked on for a long time, and we believe that shareholders will support it.”",News/Business,Mike Cannon-Brookes says large AGL shareholders back his bid to stop energy giant’s demerger,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/03/agl-vows-to-continue-demerger-despite-share-raid-by-mike-cannon-brookes
5/3/2022,"Ukrainians are inking the fight for their country on to their bodies, with artists getting requests for tattoos of molotov cocktails, anti-tank missiles and even a type of bread that has become an unlikely symbol of national identity because Russians struggle to pronounce it. As people filtered back to Kyiv after Russian troops abandoned their attempts to seize it, tattoo artists noticed an increasing demand for art that paid tribute to this spring of tragedy and violence, and to Ukraine’s spirit of resistance. “I wanted to capture this moment,” said Mariika, a tattoo artist who now has an anti-tank hedgehog on her leg and a molotov cocktail on her arm. She has stayed in Kyiv throughout the war, watching the tales she heard as a young girl become terrifying reality. “I never thought I would live through something like this. My grandmother was a child of war, but her stories seemed so distant. Hiding in the basement from bombs is never something I thought would happen to me.” For several Saturdays she has joined a group of tattoo artists gathered in a Kyiv party district for a fundraising day at a nightclub, currently out of action because of the war and curfew. Other dancefloors have been commandeered as temporary headquarters for volunteers making camouflage netting, organising aid or preparing molotov cocktails. Anyone can turn up for a tattoo; the price is whatever they can afford to give the Ukrainian armed forces. No money changes hands, they just have to show a receipt for their donation. “At the start of the war it was impossible to work, there were no clients and no moving around. But then people started asking about tattoos so we organised this event,” said Alexander, a 34-year-old artist with 11 years’ experience. “I collected my friends and each weekend more and more artists are taking part.” They have already raised more than 100,000 hryvnia (£2,700) for the army and plan to keep going as long as there is demand and they have the needles and ink to meet it. Not all of the new designs are military-inspired. Some people want to forget the war, with tattoos of cats, and others want to mark the moment without direct reference to the war. “I wanted to do a patriotic tattoo and I wanted to remember this period of time and the emotions associated with it, but I didn’t want anything aggressive,” said Fedor, a 23-year-old IT manager who got the word palyanytsia – a traditional bread often eaten at special occasions – tattooed on his arm. Because Russians struggle to pronounce it, Ukrainians joke that the bread is an unofficial national “password” to catch potential Russian spies. “People will ask what that means and I will explain. I want to highlight Ukrainian identity.” Mariika said some people asked for symbols of their cities. One girl who had recently escaped Russian-controlled Kherson wanted a slice of the watermelon that her home city is famous for. Kyivites have asked for the chestnut leaf that is a symbol of the city. But others thrust into the violence of a brutal war want more explicit tributes to the way their lives have suddenly changed, including images of British next generation light anti-tank weapons (NLAWs) and US javelins. “One man who shot NLAWs wanted a tattoo with a picture of one, a heart and the words ‘NLAW in Love’,” said Alexander. Early in the war he was also asked to do tattoos for an entire unit. “Twelve people all wanted the same tattoo on their hands.” It was the trident – the national coat of arms – a silhouette of their group and its name. “They came to me to do a tattoo at night because at that time Russians were super close to Kyiv and it was all very unsafe. One of them was 52 years old.” Civilians are also grappling with the reality of finding themselves on the frontline almost overnight. Nastya, 23, who works in McDonald’s, got an image of a man throwing a molotov cocktail. “For me it symbolises the resistance of my country,” she said. Mariika’s husband, Oscar, who moved from Iceland when they married, has a new tattoo of an AK47 with a sunflower – the national flower – growing out of it. It is partly in tribute to an elderly woman who was filmed pressing packets of sunflower seeds on Russian soldiers to put in their pockets, saying the flowers would grow when they were killed in battle. “I saw a video about sunflower seeds and I thought it is a good representation of the spirit of Ukrainians now,” he said. Other designs include the now-ubiquitous Ukrainian border guards’ retort to a Russian ship that demanded their surrender, “Russian warship, go fuck yourself”, and an image of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy waving two guns.
