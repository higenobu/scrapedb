3/13/2022,"Rishi Sunak has called on UK firms to stop investing in Russia, as he welcomed the decisions made by some companies, such as the energy firms BP and Shell, along with the investment firms Aviva, M&G and Vanguard, to divest away from Russian assets. Those companies, among others, have announced their intention to reduce or sell investments in Russia in recent days after its invasion of Ukraine, and the chancellor urged more UK businesses to consider joining them. Sunak said: “I welcome commitments already made by a number of firms to divest from Russian assets – and I want to make it crystal clear that the government supports further signals of intent. “I am urging firms to think very carefully about their investments in Russia and how they may aid the Putin regime – and I am also clear that there is no case for new investment in Russia. We must collectively go further in our mission to inflict maximum economic pain – and to stop further bloodshed.” Sunak and the economic secretary, John Glen, met fund managers and other leading figures in finance last week to discuss UK investment in Russia and welcomed the consensus among firms on the need to economically isolate Putin and his regime. This has led to big writedowns of Russian assets, with BP’s decision to sell its 20% stake in the Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft costing it up to $25bn (£19.1bn). New York-based BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset management firm, with more than $10tn in assets under management, has recorded $17bn in losses on Russian securities. It manages more than $18bn in Russian assets on behalf of clients – which were frozen on 28 February. The impact of western sanctions on markets, including the two-week shutdown of the Moscow stock exchange, has rendered the vast majority of those assets unsaleable. Banking group HSBC is under pressure from the public to cut its ties with Russian oil and gas firms, with some customers threatening to switch banks, according to campaign group 38 Degrees. When Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase became the first major US banks to announce they would wind down their businesses in Russia on Thursday, Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest bank, still refused to follow suit – only to make a U-turn a day later. The UK government said it recognised that some firms may find winding down their positions is a long-term process, given market conditions and the ability to sell assets because of the global sanctions placed on the Russian economy. It said it was “working at pace to sanction more oligarchs with close links to the Kremlin”. As oil, gas, wheat and other commodity prices have soared globally, threatening to exacerbate the cost of living crisis, the government vowed to “do everything we can to protect consumers and the public”. It said it was already providing support worth £21bn this year and next, to help people with the cost of living, and that it would continue to monitor the economic impact of the conflict.",News/Politics,Rishi Sunak urges UK companies to stop investing in Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/13/rishi-sunak-urges-uk-companies-to-stop-investing-in-russia-putin-ukraine
3/13/2022,"Every night, Julia Samuel goes to bed and silently recites a list of names. She begins with her nine grandchildren, then her three daughters, her son, their partners, and then her husband of 42 years – it’s a ritual she started, to look after her family. And then every morning she gets up, has a cup of tea, and goes upstairs to look after everybody else’s. Samuel holds a unique place in the British psyche, one seeded before she was born (into the banking side of the Guinness dynasty) and one that grew in complicated ways with her appearance in the tabloids alongside her friend Diana, Princess of Wales, evolving again as she became a counsellor, working in the NHS at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, where she pioneered the role of maternity and paediatric psychotherapist, and founded the charity Child Bereavement UK. Now 62, she’s a bestselling author of books that attempt to guide readers through trauma and change, and consequently has become the public face of bereavement, so often the most darkly private thing. It was Samuel who Brendan Cox called before breaking the news of his wife’s murder to their children, and (though neither have confirmed this) Samuel who Meghan Markle is believed to have called when she felt suicidal during pregnancy. This role, a sort of unofficial grief tsar, must bring with it a certain amount of pressure. “I don’t feel pressure,” she smiles, “I feel energy. The last few years I’ve seen more suffering than I’ve ever seen in my whole career. The fact that there was no bedside or graveside – it’s been a much more complicated grief. Much more protracted, more traumatic. Seeing your partner die on an iPad while you’re isolating at home is truly awful.” What does she think the ripples from this will be? “I think it’ll enter the therapy rooms for years to come.” It’s her therapy room we are in today, above her west London apartment at the top of five flights of carpeted stairs – she is used to waiting here for clients with a ready glass of water. We are meeting to discuss her third book. – It’s about families, the place we love and hate hardest, the only relationship we can never leave. “I became fascinated by how patterns in families get passed on. And how what isn’t dealt with in one generation goes down to the next until someone’s prepared to feel the pain. Often, it’s the things that are unsaid that cause more harm than the event itself, or the stories that are made up to cover up the secrets.” There are eight case studies, including the family of a gay couple adopting a daughter, the ultra-Orthodox family of a survivor of Auschwitz, and a family finally ready to deal with their father’s suicide. Samuel unrolls each story like a delicate canvas, explaining her own emotional reactions along the way. She’s often told she cries a lot for a therapist. “Well, I’m emotionally invested. And I couldn’t put on a mask – I think part of being able to create a therapeutic relationship is that it’s genuine. But I keep one foot in my world so I can move back and then be responsive. Because otherwise…” What? “I’m not doing my job properly.” Her book begins with the line, “Every family has a story,” except, her family never told theirs. She grew up in a house of privilege and ghosts, where her three siblings and twin brother were raised with stiff upper lips and framed photographs of the dead. At 20, she married, and over the next nine years had four children. Becoming a parent herself inspired her to think about her own parents’ histories of addiction, and at 27 she went with a friend to an AA meeting. “I heard people talking about how they actually felt. I had no idea that people could really do that – it was incredibly powerful. Now when I look back, I think I wanted to do this work because of all the unexpressed loss of my parents. But it took me a long time, and quite a lot of therapy to work that out.” Over the course of writing this book, meeting families over Zoom, people who hadn’t come to her to unpick their pasts but instead to deal with their painful presents, she found herself changed again. “I was a very imperfect mother and I’m also an imperfect grandmother,” she chuckles. “But I’m a bit more compassionate towards myself about it now. And I felt differently about my own parents, too, how they had been so impacted by their history, their losses. After writing the book, I ‘got it’ in a much deeper way.” Can she tell me more about that? “You’d be a very good therapist,” Samuel smiles, and I wait, professionally. “Well. I really love my [late] mum and dad, but they were quite old-school. I had understood psychologically why they didn’t talk much about the people they’d lost, for instance their parents in the First World War. But I think I still held some level of criticism for them. And now I can see they didn’t really have any option.” She’s reluctant to talk about her own children, or how her (allegedly) “imperfect” parenting might have impacted them, but she will offer a quote from Nora Ephron. “She said: ‘You know you’ve brought up successful kids when they can earn enough to pay for their own therapy.’ Ha!” Samuel’s destiny, when she was growing up, was the life of a comfortable housewife, perhaps a little light fundraising. And for a while it looked as though she was content with that – she worked as an interior decorator in the 1980s, sharing school pick-ups with Diana. “But I always liked work. The structure, the purpose of it. It’s a big part of my identity. I like being a different person, being outside your family. I didn’t know until later how meaningful that was.” At 31, after training, she went to work in the obstetric unit of St Mary’s as its first counsellor for families whose children had died. Before then there was very little support around stillbirths in the UK. “I think in some ways, not knowing what I didn’t know supported me. So I listened and I cared.” Her first case was a couple whose daughter had been born at 28 weeks and died a month later. Recently, walking through an airport, Samuel saw the mother again – they’d had another child, he’d recently got married, they hugged. She grins, remembering. “You don’t ever get over a loss of a child, but by the time they stopped seeing me they did find a way of living with it.” Three years later, Samuel founded a national charity that supports families and trains professionals to help when a child dies or is bereaved. “It was about getting the hospitals to stop saying, basically, ‘You need to move on.’” In practice that meant things such as encouraging maternity units to help parents of stillborn babies to take photos and footprints, to have a proper funeral. “So that they have memories, really. Because the moments between the birth and the funeral is the only time they’ll ever have with that baby. And they can’t go back and put that right. You need to give them time to make important decisions: do I dress them in this? Will the siblings come and see the baby? All that felt very… significant.” It occurs to me that through her work Samuel is providing a map to lead her parents’ generation, whose framed photos of lost relatives took the place of conversation about death, towards a healthier future where grief is understood, acceptable and sometimes messy. For all her celebrity attachments, it’s her ability to act as a link that will be her legacy. She pauses to consider. “I hadn’t thought of it like that. But yes, I’ve taken the learning from my experience and used it to improve the experiences of other people. Talking about death and bereavement is unbearable, so I want everyone to get the support they need, from the institutions but also from their family, so they don’t say the wrong things.” What are the wrong things? “‘Don’t worry, you can have another one!’ Or, ‘They were so little, you didn’t even know them.’” She shudders slightly. Before working with a gay couple who were planning to adopt a baby she “immersed” herself in research papers, LGBTQ+ books, data and memoirs, and “gave herself a sharp dig”. “I didn’t realise I was so heterosexually biased,” she says. “It was a wonderful expansion of understanding.” It’s striking throughout her book how regularly Samuel names her privilege, pausing in the narrative to describe the research she took on or the discomfort she felt. “Well, of course. The thing I always start with is that when we work together, we bring our histories with us. Our histories will meet and if I have misunderstood what you’re saying or what your experiences are, let me know. But what I didn’t take on board before was the level of privilege I have just walking into a shop. And not having that experience of being looked at like a Black woman might, or their weathering of anxiety of being a black body in a white space. That’s what I’m learning all the time. I still find it uncomfortable. But there’s no way I can work authentically with people without naming our differences of experience.” When she left St Mary’s after 25 years, she began working with adults who were dying. “It put me much more in touch with my own mortality.” She wrote down all her passwords and WhatsApped a photo of them to her children, “telling them I have prepared everything that I’d want when I died, that I didn’t want to be resuscitated, all these kinds of things”. She’d realised we need to be talking about death when we are alive and well. “There was a woman I was seeing whose friends would not talk to her about the fact she was dying. They kept saying things like, ‘The medicine is amazing, you’re going to be fine.’ And she was never going to be fine. That had a big impact.” Sometimes Samuel recites an acronym: Fine – freaked out, insecure, neurotic and emotional. But spending her time facing death did two things to her. It made her grateful for her own life and that of the people she loves. And it made her turn off the TV. “Yes, when I’m not working I want nothing to do with death. So I don’t watch sad films. I don’t read sad books. I don’t watch the news. I do everything that is to do with life and vibrancy and happy endings.” She started kickboxing 28 years ago, “because it makes me feel fierce and strong”. Seated still, she shows me two stabby little punches before smoothing down the dark florals of her dress. “It’s a way of releasing all my frustration – I find it incredibly satisfying.” What does she think about when she’s boxing? “People’s stories that I’m upset about, or more often nothing at all – I just feel pure, pure joy.” Fighting is something that matters to Samuel. Despite her boxing skills, “I am not very good at fighting,” she says. “But inevitably where we love most we also annoy each other most. And if we keep swallowing what’s annoyed us, it causes a separation. Fighting productively means not using words as weapons of mass destruction.” The crucial thing is the repair – when everyone has calmed down, she says it’s important to discuss what the fight was really about. “And it may have been that your mum forgot your swimming kit that morning. But it also could have been that you feel sad because you felt forgotten. Then you feel closer and more trusting, because you can fight and still be loved.” As she was reminded by working with families over lockdown, sometimes these fights are never resolved. Like that forgotten swimming kit, they ripen and grow mould, poisoning relationships for decades to come. “Problems get buried and then dragged up. And so, you don’t feel loved afterwards, you feel injured. And that can stay in you forever.” I say I feel like this should be part of the curriculum. “Definitely!” So, I must ask… I start. “Oh, must you?” she winces. We have to talk about her relationship with Diana and her sons – Samuel is godmother to Prince George and as such remains a figure of intense interest, with details of the type of presents she gives him (large, noisy and with many complicated pieces for William to put together) verging on front page news. “Well, I feel lucky I was such a good friend of Princess Diana. And I really love my godson, George. And it’s a lovely way of loving her,” she says, elegantly. I wonder how much influence she had on the princes’ decision, which at the time felt so radical, to talk publiclyabout their own mental health. “I think both the princes have really turned the dial on talking about grief so honestly and also about mental health. But that was all theirs – completely off their own bats.” I remember driving through London the nights following Diana’s death, seeing all the flowers, their scent heavy on the wind. How did it feel to grieve her friend’s death privately when strangers were grieving so loudly? “I felt angry,” she says. “I was angry that she died, and shocked and I couldn’t really understand it all. I mean, I understand it better now.” I wait. “I understand that people felt they really knew and loved her. But I still feel sad today.” She looks a little pained and I apologise – it’s one thing to ask her to talk about grief, it’s quite another to ask repeatedly about a friend who died 25 years ago. “I feel that in some ways, my professional life is completely separate from my friendships and private life. But, of course, nothing is separate. Who I am and who I know is also part of my professional self. And so…” she shrugs. “That’s me.” I ready myself to go back outside, into a square behind Hyde Park where the country is limping back to work after months at home. As well as grief, Samuel has seen in her clients the smaller irritations the pandemic has caused, the anxieties, the pains. “But pain is the agent of change. So we have to allow this new reality to hit us. And it’s uncomfortable, so we have to support ourselves through it, mainly through love and connection.” How does she deal with change? “I really don’t like it, so I resist.” And then? “And then,” she grins, leaning forward in her consulting chair, “I swallow my own medicine.” Julia Samuel reflects on her own family’s trauma in this extract from her new book The story of the family I was born into was one of great privilege and multiple traumas. But we didn’t tell stories. There was no narrative or understanding of what had been, what was going on, or how to deal with it. My parents were young adults during the Second World War. My father was in the Navy and my mother was a Land Girl. But that was not where their injuries lay. My mother’s parents and two siblings had all died suddenly and unexpectedly by the time she was 25 years old. My father’s father and brother had also died, without warning, when he was still a young man. Their fathers had fought in the First World War. As with the majority of people living in that era, and as my generation of baby-boomers can attest, they abided by the need to survive and multiply. They had admirable tenacity, grit and courage. Their route to survival, the only one open to them, was to forget and move on. They lived by the adage that what you don’t talk or think about won’t hurt you. Putting on a good show, hiding vulnerability and, yes, a stiff upper lip were the mantras of my childhood and that of most of my generation. But even when it’s out of sight – perhaps especially when it’s out of sight – the fingerprint of love and loss inside us continues to gather complexity. It isn’t always visible to the naked eye, but is still complicated, still textured, still painful. What is often not recognised is that behaviours like these are the legacy of trauma. Trauma doesn’t have language. Trauma has no concept of time. It sits on high alert in our bodies, ready to be ignited many decades after the original traumatic event. It doesn’t allow for the processing of emotion. For me it meant many pieces of the jigsaw were missing. I remember looking at black-and-white photographs of my dead grandparents, aunts and uncles, examining them for clues because I knew practically nothing about them. The first time I saw a photograph of my maternal grandfather was this year. There were so many secrets and so much was left unsaid that I look back at my parents now and wonder: what did they know? What did they think about? Did they know what they felt? As a couple, did they ever talk about the things that mattered to them? And those secrets, did they tell each other or not? They certainly didn’t voice any of it within my earshot. This meant I was constantly observing and listening for clues. As it turned out it was the perfect brew to ferment a psychotherapist: I was always curious, listening intently, keenly interested in what was happening behind the façade, like a detective looking in the dust for footprints. My parents have died yet they live on in me, continually shaping and influencing me, as do all our key relationships. I am hugely grateful to them. I learnt from them many crucial skills, behaviours and ways of being that serve me well. I still benefit now from the immense opportunities they gave me. I am no different from my clients – every one I have counselled has focused on their family. They want to know why they have difficulty with their relatives or describe why they love them, and everything in between. In my therapy, I spent great tracts of time exploring my family of origin and my family now, trying to make sense of what was going on. At its best, family is the safe place where we can be our whole selves, with all of our frailties and faultlines, and still be loved and deeply understood. Ideally, it is a place where the roots of our development are fully known, the atmosphere we grew up in acknowledged. When they are “good enough”, as Donald Winnicott, the eminent paediatrician and psychoanalyst, termed it, families form the bedrock of our lives, a foundation that keeps us steady when we face the brickbats of life. When functioning well, we can turn to our family in adversity, and for team support. When the external world feels fractured and alienating, home and family can be a refuge to heal and rebuild our strength. We may not see our family, but they are still part of us, genetically, in our memories and our unconscious. We can never leave them, as we can a partner or a friendship. There are ongoing debates about nature and nurture. When we are born we are given a genetic blueprint: our propensity for intelligence, athleticism and character traits, and we know that their potential can be fulfilled or blunted by our environment. The random luck of what kind of family we are born into, wealth or poverty, history, psychological health and family patterns, influences the quality of the nurture. But at the heart of wellbeing is our core identity: “I am loved and I belong. This family is my home and safe place whatever happens to me or them.” From my own experience and what I have learnt from the families I see, when comparing non-biologically and biologically related families, the stories we tell ourselves become who we are. When we are told truthful stories, we trust that we are loved and belong. And we thrive, whatever our genetic inheritance or connection. Families are messy, chaotic and imperfect. Where we love and care most, we also hurt most, fight hardest and make our deepest mistakes. Yet we thrive when our family is held securely within and around us. It is worth the effort, heartache and strife. When we can trust in it, it can be the force that holds us together when our world is upended. Even across great distances, when our family is at the centre of our being it can help us find our own equilibrium despite the disorder and madness in the world. The best thing we can do to help this is to prioritise our family, in our hearts, our minds – and with our time.

3/13/2022,"If you heard that there’s a social network attracting 200 new users every minute, has its users making 9,000 new connections, and which says that the often hard-to-reach gen Zers make up a growing fraction of that new activity, you would probably think it must be Snapchat, TikTok, or some new social network that you have never heard of – but you would be wrong. One further official company statistic would make the answer glaringly obvious: the site also handles 4,500 job adverts every minute, and claims that six people actually get a new job each minute too. With that detail, it could only be LinkedIn – the social media network many of us tend to forget exists. LinkedIn can be accused of many things, but being cool is rarely one of them. As a social network centred on work – and owned by Microsoft, still a hugely successful tech company but seen as something of a 90s relic – it has a reputation for earnestness bordering on naff. TikTok and Instagram dominate the cultural conversation, Facebook still has the largest user base and Twitter is the social network journalists spend far too much of their time on – leaving LinkedIn often unregarded. The flipside of that, though, is that as we’ve had a backlash against big tech and the dangers of social media, LinkedIn has escaped the bad press almost entirely. We might worry about Mark Zuckerberg spying on us – to the point where he’s not just a household name, but the butt of jokes in comedy sketches across the world – but most of the surveillance on LinkedIn is carried out by other users, whether it be for genuine work-related reasons or for nefarious purposes, such as learning about someone you’ve matched with on a dating app. It helps that LinkedIn doesn’t need to track your activity across its site, app and the web in the openly invasive way that Facebook does in order to monetise your activity on its network. Because it has a clear work focus, LinkedIn can make money directly from users allowing it to message strangers, and it can make still more money from recruiters, as it’s by far the most obvious tech platform on which to advertise jobs. But that need to appeal to gen Z – a group that we are told wants a very different relationship with the world of work – is persuading LinkedIn to retool its site, pivoting towards video and other new features to attract the younger demographic. Can the work-based social network have it all? Can it keep its old users while gaining new ones and continuing to avoid the backlash that’s hit other networks? It’s certainly the case that posts that cut through on LinkedIn are very different to what lands anywhere else – often to the point that they then go viral on other social networks for all the wrong reasons. Indeed, Reddit has an entire forum dedicated solely to LinkedIn posts. Among the highlights are a post that opens with: “I have never quite understood the concept of 5-day work week. Why do we need an off from work we enjoy? … there seems to be no rational explanation of 5-day week.” Other “inspirational” content includes sharing memes of apparently random acts of kindness, such as an exam paper with a handwritten note at the end stating, “If you could, can you give my bonus points to whoever scores the lowest?” shared with the caption, “More of this, please #kindness”. The earnestness, in one sense, is part of LinkedIn’s strength: it is a professional social network, and so doesn’t lend itself to strong opinions, trolling or abuse – people self-censor to a much greater degree on LinkedIn than other networks, making moderators’ jobs easier, but leaving people fishing for things to post (hence the banalities). When the workforce still includes some boomers, virtually all of gen X and millennials, and now increasing number of gen Zers, recruitment and even self-promotion can require speaking several different online languages. Having come of age during the Snapchat and TikTok era, gen Z have an affinity for video not matched by any of their peers – making it essential for even professional purposes. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky explained having to amend his site. “We’re seeing a lot of gen Z join the network right now,” he said. “They’re much more interested in portraying themselves through video or through a much more robust profile than maybe older generations.” LinkedIn had previously experimented with a Snapchat/Instagram-style “stories” video feature, but dropped it unceremoniously more than a year ago owing to lack of demand. Its new efforts to incorporate video are more centred on video profiles and longer-form video. If you’ve seen Legally Blonde, you may remember that Elle inexplicably applied to Harvard via video. LinkedIn video profiles are that idea made real – and often just as cringeworthy. The site even offers “topic prompts” to help people record a memorable profile video. In the past year the platform has added a number of features geared to attracting and retaining users, none are particularly original but they attempt to imitate career and workplace content that users may be enjoying on other services. A newsletter feature was rolled out to qualifying members in November and in February it added a podcast network, which will include a show from co-founder Reid Hoffman called The Start-Up of You. In January it debuted a Clubhouse-type live audio feature and soon a new video live events platform is promised, allowing users to host conferences, “fireside chats” and the like entirely on LinkedIn. Meanwhile, tweaks are being made to accomodate changing attitudes, post-pandemic, to work-life balance. For example, to overcome the stigma often associated with career breaks, the platform now suggests a dozen ways for people to explain gaps in their CV, from “personal goal pursuit” to “full time parenting”. Another feature designed to appeal to gen Z is the ability to block all “political” content from users’ feeds, on an opt-in basis. But by using algorithms to shield its users from content political or otherwise, LinkedIn risks embroiling itself in another set of arguments that can quickly turn toxic. This is a political decision in itself and another example of how navigating the generational waters is a tricky task, even for an 18-year-old social network. Social media consultant Matt Navarra believes LinkedIn has done a good job of keeping off-radar for a few years and then got on with adapting its features for the post-Covid world. “There’s been a change in the way the world operates in terms of employment,” says Navarra. “LinkedIn has had to adapt to it [but there is] a huge opportunity there. And so they’ve added lots of features to help freelancers, creators, people who work from home, and bolstering their video output [is part of that].” There is a chance of LinkedIn becoming the first social network to be used in the same way by four different generations, perhaps giving it the most certain prospect of long-term success. That would make LinkedIn the tortoise to Facebook’s hare. Now tell me that wouldn’t make a good #inspirational LinkedIn status update.",News/Technology,Job’s a good’un: how LinkedIn transformed itself into a gen Z-friendly social media contender ,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/13/linkedin-gen-z-social-media-revival
3/13/2022,"Experimental, initially slightly inaccessible, this dramatised documentary about the family history of Portuguese first-time director Catarina Vasconcelos has a cumulative power that draws the audience into its dreamy, contemplative rhythms. Both Vasconcelos and her father lost their mothers early; she uses this as a bridge between them as they muse on the absence of these women and their effect on the lives they touched. But more than this, the film is a treasure box of family legends. The letters between Vasconcelos’s grandmother and her grandfather, a sailor, are poetically reimagined (in fact the actual letters were burned at her grandfather’s request after he died).",Arts/Film,The Metamorphosis of Birds review – poetic Portuguese documentary,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/13/the-metamorphosis-of-birds-review-poetic-portuguese-documentary-catarina-vasconcelos
3/13/2022,"The United States men’s team continued their dominance of para ice hockey on the final day of the 2022 Winter Paralympics with an emphatic 5-0 victory over Canada. It was a repeat of the 2018 final, which was a much closer affair decided in overtime, and marks the fourth consecutive time that the US have struck gold in the event. Just over 1,000 people watched the match at the Beijing National Indoor Stadium, seeing Declan Farmer and Brody Roybal score two goals each with Josh Paulsgetting one. There was also a US gold in the cross-country relay. A stunning final leg by Jake Adicoff saw the American team move up from fourth to first place, with China taking silver and Canada securing bronze. It means that Ukrainian-born US athlete Oksana Masters finishes the Games with seven medals, having ended up on the podium in every event in which she competed. Ukraine had gone into the race as favourites, but could only finish fourth. There was another gold for Ukraine, though, at the National Biathlon Centre in Zhangjiakou, a record 11th for them. Anatoliy Kovalevskyi anchored the 4x2.5km cross-country relay team, finishing just over 25 seconds ahead of the team from France, with Norway taking the bronze. Veteran Brian McKeever, in his last race at a Winter Paralympics, missed the chance to become the most successful male Winter Paralympian of all time as Canada could only finish 6th, and he finishes his career with 16 gold medals. On the slopes of the Yanqing National Alpine Skiing Centre, Italy’s Giacomo Bertagnolli successfully defending his 2018 men’s vision impaired slalom title, preventing Austrian teen sensation Johannes Aigner claiming a third gold by just 0.28 seconds. In the men’s standing slalom, France’s Arthur Bauchet added a third gold of Games, with China’s Liang Jingyi 2.66 seconds behind him. Defending champion Adam Hall of New Zealand finished third in what he described as “challenging conditions”. Afterwards Hall said “the snow conditions have changed quite a lot over the last couple of days. But we’re trained in every condition and every scenario possible so it was just a matter of getting down the best that I could.” The event had been moved around the schedule due to the warm weather conditions, and Hall said “You do get sick of waiting a little bit, you just want it to be over and done, which can kind of play with the nerves. I’m just happy to get up here and get the business done.” The final gold of the Games went to Norway’s Jesper Pedersen; the Alpine skiing course became increasingly difficult, leading to his expected main rival, Jeroen Kampschreur of the Netherlands, crashing out. With a number of athletes experiencing difficulty, Niels de Langen of the Netherlands moved up from fifth to take silver on the second run, and Italy’s Rene De Silvestro won bronze. Perhaps the most popular medal of the last couple of days has been awarded to Riley, the guide dog of Austria’s Carina Edlinger. The dog has become a star away from the sport with his appearances in the Paralympic village and on the podium. The 23-year-old Edlinger, who has between 1.5 and 2 per cent vision, said she would not have been able to compete in Beijing without Riley accompanying her.

China have topped the medal table at the last five consecutive summer Paralympics, but with the sport concluded, the hosts have now finished top for the first time at a Winter Paralympics. They finished with 61 medals in total, including 18 golds. Ukraine’s recorded their highest-ever medal-total of 29, and their 11 golds place them second in the final standings. Canada were third, France fourth and the US fifth. Great Britain finished with one gold, one silver and four bronze. The last action of the day in Beijing will be the closing ceremony at the Bird’s Nest stadium, when the Paralympics flag will be formally handed over to the next hosts – the Italian cities of Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo. The closing ceremony starts at 8pm in Beijing, which is noon UK time.",Sport/Sport,Winter Paralympics: USA men win ice hockey on final day of Beijing Games,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/13/winter-paralympics-usa-men-win-ice-hockey-on-final-day-of-beijing-games
3/13/2022,"JK Rowling has accused Keir Starmer of publicly misrepresenting equalities law, in what she says is “yet another indication that the Labour party can no longer be counted on to defend women’s rights”. The Harry Potter author was responding to comments the Labour leader gave to the Times, when asked to define a woman. Starmer, formerly the director of public prosecutions, the most senior prosecutor in England and Wales, said: “A woman is a female adult, and in addition to that trans women are women, and that is not just my view, that is actually the law. It has been the law through the combined effects of the 2004 [Gender Recognition] Act and the 2010 [Equality] Act.” He called for reforms of the Gender Recognition Act, under which people diagnosed with gender dysphoria who have lived in their acquired gender for at least two years can apply to be legally recognised. “The process that people have to go through does need to be looked at,” he told the Times. “If you talk to anybody who’s been through the process there’s a real issue about respect and dignity.” On Saturday, Rowling said in a tweet: “I don’t think our politicians have the slightest idea how much anger is building among women from all walks of life at the attempts to threaten and intimidate them out of speaking publicly about their own rights, their own bodies and their own lives. “Among the thousands of letters and emails I’ve received are disillusioned members of Labour, the Greens, the Lib Dems and the SNP. Women are scared, outraged and angry at the deaf ear turned to their well-founded concerns. But women are organising. “Now @Keir_Starmer publicly misrepresents equalities law, in yet another indication that the Labour party can no longer be counted on to defend women’s rights. But I repeat: women are organising across party lines, and their resolve and their anger are growing.” Rowling said “innumerable gay people” had written to her saying they felt “under attack”. She said: “Like women, they – especially lesbians – are under attack for not wishing to be redefined and for refusing to use ideological language they find offensive,” she said. Under the current 2004 Gender Recognition Act in England and Wales, a transgender person is only legally recognised as their acquired gender after they have received a gender recognition certificate (GRC). But the Equality Act 2010 provides protection for trans people who have not yet transitioned or obtained a GRC. Section 7 of the act gives protection to anyone with the protected characteristic of “gender reassignment”, defined as anyone who “is proposing to undergo, is undergoing or has undergone a process (or part of a process) for the purpose of reassigning the person’s sex by changing physiological or other attributes of sex”. The Equality Act also allows providers of separate or single-sex services to provide a different service to, or exclude, someone who has the protected characteristic of gender reassignment, including those with and without a GRC, provided that the service providers can prove it is “a proportionate means of achieving legitimate aim”. In the Times interview Starmer called for a “more considered, respectful, tolerant debate about these issues”, adding: “I don’t think it furthers the interests of anybody to continue the debate in the way that it’s been going on now for some time.”",News/Politics,JK Rowling says Keir Starmer misrepresents law over ‘woman’ definition,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/13/jk-rowling-keir-starmer-misrepresents-law-woman-definition-labour
3/13/2022,"Ministers should consider subsidising e-bikes as they do electric cars, campaigners have urged, after a study found that mass use of such bikes could create more than £2bn in health benefits and cut a million tonnes of emissions annually. While grants of up to £1,500 are available for low-emission cars, vans and motorbikes, there is no such assistance for electric-assist bikes, which help propel riders up to a maximum powered speed of 15mph when the bike is being pedalled. According to an evidence review by academics at Westminster University, commissioned by the campaign group Bike is Best, boosting e-bike use would bring other benefits not created by electric cars, including reduced road congestion and fewer potentially dangerous particulates from tyre and brake wear. E-bikes have become increasingly common in the UK, but sales are still well below levels seen in many other European countries, where studies have shown they are particularly popular with older riders and with women. The study included polling that shows 67% of Britons who might be interested in buying an e-bike are put off by the price. But of these, the poll said, 53% would be likely to buy one if there was a hypothetical subsidy of £250 on a £1,000 model. The study used the Department for Transport’s so-called propensity to cycle tool, based on detailed data about work trips and used to inform decisions on cycling schemes, to calculate that mass bike infrastructure and access to e-bikes could prompt up to 25% of commuting trips to be made by bike. Such a switch would produce overall economic health benefits in England and Wales of £2.2bn a year, most of this coming from better health due to e-bike use, but also because of lower levels of staff absence through illness. While e-bikes provide less of a health benefit per mile than unpowered bikes, studies have shown that users tend to end up with similar overall levels of physical activity because e-bike riders travel longer distances on average. The latest study found that promoting e-bike use would mean a particular rise among people who live in more rural or hilly areas. Both the £2.2bn health dividend and the estimated saving of a million tonnes a year in carbon emissions are based just on commuting, as that is the data on which the propensity to cycle tool is based. The overall savings could thus be significantly greater, the authors said. The statistics are for England and Wales only, as they are the source of the propensity to cycle data. While fully electric cars produce no carbon emissions while in motion, the million-tonne saving was calculated from the lower power requirement to recharge an e-bike – studies have put this at 2% of what is needed for an electric car – and substantially lower emissions associated with their construction. As well as commuting, the study notes, the development of e-cargo bikes could create even more emissions reductions through urban freight use, a significant contributor to road transport emissions. Studies have suggested e-cargo bikes could replace up to a quarter of all so-called last mile deliveries currently done using vans. Consumer models can be used to carry children and heavy shopping. Scott Purchas from Bike is Best said the UK risked lagging behind other European countries on e-bike use: “The future is electric but not in the way people might think. All of the focus for subsidies has been for electric cars, but this new report demonstrates the substantial benefits of electric bikes and how essential they are for rapidly decarbonising transport, improving our health and cleaning up the air at the same time.” A Department for Transport spokesperson said the government was investing £2bn in cycling and walking, and that e-bikes for commuting were already subsidised under the tax-saving Cycle to Work scheme.",News/Politics,UK ministers urged to promote e-bikes to tackle health and climate crises,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/13/uk-ministers-urged-subsidise-e-bikes-tackle-health-and-climate-crises
3/13/2022,"Ryan Reynolds reunites with Free Guy director Shawn Levy for a time-travelling romp that matches their previous collaboration for excitable energy, and surpasses it for likability. Reynolds dials down his punchable smirk but keeps the swagger to play Adam, a renegade pilot who crash-lands in 2022 and is forced to team up with his 12-year-old self (a star-making turn from newcomer Walker Scobell) to save the future. The smart-alec repartee between the two versions of Adam, large and small, fails to conceal the fact that they find each other deeply irritating. But, it becomes clear, both are still grieving the unexpected death of their father (Mark Ruffalo), a scientist whose genius may be the key to unravelling the chaos to come, as well as unwittingly causing it in the first place. The high-concept plot is held together more by force of will (and some decent special effects) than by logic, but the core of this engaging, kid-friendly Netflix production is a big-hearted tale of broken families made good.

3/13/2022,"Cacophonous crashes signal the opening. Searching beams of light swivel from the tops of a seeming-forest of scaffolding towers, crisscrossing through “fog and filthy air”. Nicola T Chang’s music, Hayley Grindle’s design and Chris Davey’s lighting plunge us into an ear-ringingly rigid landscape, all hard edges and mechanistic structures, central to them a giant drawbridge ramp that, when raised, becomes a hanging platform, exalting those who pace it, threatening to crush those below. This is an effective evocation of Shakespeare’s fast-paced, bloody drama about civil strife, ambition and their deadly consequences. Presentationally, then, this Macbeth is attention-grabbing and atmospheric; in other respects, though, Amy Leach’s production comes across as muddled and unfinished. New material, spliced into the original, explores the Macbeths’ “journey to become parents”: a newborn son dies and is buried; Lady Macbeth, pregnant again, suffers a miscarriage. Aspects of this additional information are conveyed via action or gesture: as when Tachia Newall’s Macbeth kneels and places his ear against Lady Macbeth (Jessica Baglow)’s stomach. In relying so much on visuals, the company seems to go against its own aim of creating a performance that anyone with sight impairment will easily be able to follow. Integration of deaf actors is poorly managed. Adam Bassett and Charlotte Arrowsmith give finely focused performances as Macduff and Lady Macduff but are ill-served by clumsy staging that makes interpretation between sign language and spoken language confusing. The whole audience, blind or sighted, deaf or hearing, is disadvantaged by the lack of clarity here, and by an overall clagginess of delivery (mismanaged stresses, inappropriate pauses) that makes meanings hard to grasp (weirdly, given that most actors use regional accents, which usually make Shakespeare’s language more accessible). Emphasis on macho-style behaviours diminishes the witches (more wacky than weird) and Lady Macbeth (meekly enduring her husband’s physical aggression), but does deliver energetic battle scenes that are full of sound and fury. Leach’s inclusive intentions are praiseworthy but, in tackling too much at once, fall short of their goal.
