1/19/2022,"It was not always clear that Rafael Nadal would make it back to the Australian Open this year, but 20 seasons into his illustrious career, he has developed a knack for blowing past even the most generous expectations. Nadal is indeed in Melbourne, he has already won five matches in the new year and for the first time in his career he is at a grand slam tournament without either of his greatest rivals, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic. On Wednesday, Nadal returned to Rod Laver Arena and saw off a strong performance by Yannick Hanfmann to win 6-2, 6-3, 6-4 and reach the third round of the Australian Open.  Nadal’s troubles last season had been a long time coming. As he emerged from the early lockdowns of 2020, he suffered a flare-up of a chronic left foot injury, Muller-Weiss Syndrome, which has affected him since he was young. By the time his classic French Open semi-final match against Novak Djokovic was done, he had reached his limit. Nadal played only one other tournament in 2021 before ending his season. As he prepared his return in December, Nadal contracted Covid on his way back from Abu Dhabi like the majority of players at the event, which he said left him “very sick with fever” and in bed for a couple of days. It was not a positive moment: “A month and a half ago I didn’t know if I would play tennis again at a professional level due to various factors, including the problems I’ve had with my foot and with covid,” he told Eurosport Spain. Instead, shortly after he returned a negative test and was cleared to enter Australia, he quietly boarded a flight to Melbourne. Expectations are tempered, but the first steps have been smooth and Nadal won the ATP 250 event in Melbourne. After his Australian Open first-round win over Marcos Giron, Nadal stared down Hanfmann, a 30-year-old qualifier ranked 126 who could not have enjoyed a more different path to one of the biggest stadiums in the world. Rather than bursting on to the tour at a young age, Hanfmann spent his formative years playing college tennis for the University of Southern California. His progress has been incremental, a career high ranking of 92 achieved last year. In perhaps the biggest match of his life, he rose to the occasion and played extremely well from the beginning. His serve was firing, he stepped inside the baseline and rejected Nadal’s high-bouncing topspin with vicious crosscourt backhands and he frequently showed delicate touches at the net. But the challenge of facing Nadal, whether he has four recent matches behind him or 42, remains the same. Competing to him means consistently taking those risks, making sound decisions and executing forcefully point after point for up to five long sets. Nadal comfortably navigated those challenging rallies, he moved well and struck his forehand freely. After being dragged into two complicated final service games, he held off any further complications by improving his serve under pressure at the close. After a six-month layoff, five matches against players ranked outside of the top 50 offer no indication of how Nadal’s game and body will hold up against more challenging, higher-ranked players to come. Nadal says that the most pleasing outcome of the past few weeks is that these wins have offered him a new chance to further improve his level. He will next face either Karen Khachanov, the 28th seed, or Benjamin Bonzi. “I’m excited about it,” he said. “I’m excited about the fact that I’m going to be playing in a third round for one more time here after all the things I am going through. I don’t have big pressure on my shoulders, honestly. I don’t feel it. The pressure is only to stay healthy and to enjoy the fact that I am competing again, then give my best as I did during all my tennis career.” Ever since Nadal was a teenage prodigy managing chronic knee and foot injuries, so many people believed that his physicality would not be conducive to longevity in his sport. Yet at 35 years old, 20 seasons on, he is still here and his age is a frequent punchline of his own jokes. He was asked if there are any positive side to being 35, a question that most players would respond to by underlining the wealth of knowledge gained after so many years on the tour. He was having none of it. “Well, the positive thing is I achieved much more that I never dreamed. I was able to spend almost 20 fantastic years on the tour. The rest of the things? Nothing positive because [I] arrive to the end. When you get older, the watch never stops, no? That’s the circus of life. You need to accept that. But it’s all good with me,” he said, smiling widely.",Sport/Sport,Rafael Nadal revels in Australian Open return to sweep past Yannick Hanfmann,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/19/tennis-australian-open-rafael-nadal-yannick-hanfmann-second-round
1/19/2022,"After authors including Kate Mosse and Philip Pullman warned that proposals to change the UK’s copyright laws could be “devastating” for writers, the government has paused its plans. The Intellectual Property Office launched a consultation last summer into UK copyright after Brexit. Writers and publishers had feared that if the “copyright exhaustion” rule were changed, governing when the control of a rights holder over the distribution of their property expires, it could lead to a flood of cheap international editions of books.  “Authors could lose this precious ability to sell their work abroad and be fairly paid for it,” said Pullman at the time, while Mosse added that “if we don’t ensure writers remain respected for their work, then many will be forced to leave the industry and Britain’s cultural landscape will suffer hugely.” The government has now announced that due to a lack of available data, it has not been able to calculate the economic impact of any alternatives to the current regime, and will therefore maintain the UK’s current laws on exhaustion of intellectual property rights. The news was welcomed by the Save Our Books campaign, organised by the Publishers Association. “We are delighted that the government has chosen to maintain the UK’s gold standard copyright regime, which our world-leading creative industries are built on, and that ministers have listened to authors, readers and the wider industry on the risks of any change,” said PA chief executive Stephen Lotinga. “I am extremely grateful to our Save Our Books campaign partners, MPs and members of the public who have worked together to make our case to government. I know everyone will be relieved that for the moment they can get back to doing what they do best – putting incredible books into the hands of readers.” But the government also said that it “remains committed to exploring the opportunities which might come from a change to the regime”, something which the PA described as a concern. “The evidence is clear, any weakening of our intellectual property laws would be devastating to UK creators, and we will continue to make this case to government in any future discussions of the matter,” said Lotinga.",Arts/Books,Government pauses plans to rewrite UK copyright laws after authors protest,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/19/government-pauses-plans-to-rewrite-uk-copyright-laws-after-authors-protest
1/19/2022,"The socialist, historian and civil rights activist WEB Du Bois wrote in a 1903 essay titled The Talented Tenth: “The Negro race, like all races, is going to be saved by its exceptional men.” Though he isn’t a character in this ambitious debut novel by award-winning US poet Honorée Fanonne Jeffers, his spirited thinking about the important role of classical education in the fight for Black liberation pervades the book. It’s an expansive tale cataloguing the journey of one African American family across centuries, from slavery to the antebellum south and from civil war to present times. The novel starts with a family tree. We’re first introduced to Micco Cornell, the son of a Scottish man and a woman from a Native American tribe known as the Creek people, who also has African ancestry. In the late 18th century, when Cornell inherits a village from his father, he signs it over to a white man called Samuel Pinchard in case his African heritage is one day exposed. The deal is done with the promise that Pinchard will peacefully run the farm and eventually marry Cornell’s daughter, but it isn’t long before he turns brutal, buying slaves and committing endless atrocities. That’s when we learn about Aggie, who is brought from Africa and sold to Pinchard. “Tears and sleep were not luxuries cast to slaves. There was only work,” writes Jeffers. But soon, Aggie becomes an energising force intent on destabilising Pinchard’s sadistic reign.  Pulling us into modern times is Ailey, a clever, sensitive academic who is equal parts petulant and spectacular. She provides the main first-person narrative and connects with the family tree through her visits to the fictional town of Chicasetta, Georgia, where her ancestors were once enslaved and where her maternal family still live. We witness her coming of age in the 1970s and 80s, while keenly observing her family: her pale-skinned Nana, with colourist attitudes, who sometimes passes for white; her sister’s spiral into crack addiction. There’s a lot of trauma and tragedy to wade through, but there are also respites – sex scenes with forgettable men, entertaining back-and-forths with racist white graduate students. Still, Ailey’s most significant relationship is with her Uncle Root, a retired professor and formidable mentor, and the one who first introduced her to Du Bois. Alongside details of the forced arrival of African people to America and the violence experienced by Native Americans, Jeffers also explores Ailey’s mother Belle’s younger years and her experience of racial segregation, the riots during the civil rights movement, and the changing of cultural attitudes. By continually looking back, Jeffers is doing delicate needlework, stitching together the interior lives of African Americans to illustrate how they survived historical moments. Sexual abuse is a central theme, though never treated sensationally. It helps to form a larger landscape of misogynoir that stretches from Pinchard’s fetish for prepubescent Black girls, who he believes “seduce” him with their beauty, to the policing of promiscuity that Ailey observes in her college years via a list of the most sexually active girls on campus. Ailey herself is haunted by the sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of her grandfather Gandee. It also shapes her oldest sister, Lydia, who one day turns up high at her Nana’s house, shouting: “Leaving me with him, and I was nothing but a child!” Her other sister Coco, a successful doctor, responds: “You don’t see me using Gandee as an excuse to sleep late, and be lazy and eat up somebody else’s groceries.” Each sister’s trajectory shows that there is no universal way to suffer. Some of Jeffers’s strongest writing comes when Ailey abandons her family’s dream that she will become a doctor like her father, and decides to pursue a PhD researching Chicasetta. Here we see the pain that comes with being a Black historian personally connected to archival information that can make you weep and rage. This book is mammoth in size and scope and, though at times it overspills with a surplus of details, is exceptional in the way it engages so deeply and emphatically with history.

1/19/2022,"Only one year has passed since Cincinnati Bengals owner Mike Brown felt the need to issue a statement explaining why he was keeping head coach Zac Taylor, whose Bengals had won just six of 32 games in his first two seasons. Brown, the 86-year-old son of the late legendary Hall of Fame coach and Bengals founder Paul Brown, ended his statement with this kind-of-silly line (which should have been accompanied by the sound of a snarling tiger): “Next year, we will earn our stripes.”  It came as a surprise to the rest of the world, but these Bengals indeed have done some stripe-earning, winning 10 of 17 regular-season games, the AFC North for the first time in six years and their first playoff game in 31 years, outlasting the Las Vegas Raiders on Saturday. No doubt the Bengals, who are to play at Tennessee in the divisional round Saturday, would not have achieved what they have without unflappable second-year quarterback Joe Burrow, whose rookie season was cut short because of a torn left ACL and MCL. But the Bengals’ rapid rise from the depths would not have been possible without Taylor, the 38-year-old coach in whom Mike Brown still saw potential even when the Bengals pretty much stank it up his first two years. Brown saw, first-hand, that Taylor was building something. “Personally, if I coached in any other organization in football, I probably wouldn’t be here right now in my third year,” Taylor said in a news conference after the Las Vegas game. Taylor was explaining why he’d decided to give Brown a game ball. Taylor said he would be giving another game ball to long-suffering Bengals’ fans, and he did that a day later by dropping off a ball at the tavern he drives past (and sometimes stops in) on his way home from the office. “Zac Taylor’s unrelenting optimism and faith in his players has helped create the team culture he spoke of so often in his first two awful seasons,” Paul Daugherty, the veteran sports columnist for the Cincinnati Enquirer, tells the Guardian. “The players trust him. They play hard for him and for each other, and that togetherness has been a reason for their success.” Only one year has passed since Daugherty read Brown’s statement about Taylor and his team “fighting through adversity” and concluded in one of his columns: “I’d throw my hands up in the air, but it’s hard to type with my hands up in the air.” Daugherty continued: “Show of hands: At your work, does your boss frequently praise you for ‘fighting through adversity’? Funny, I thought that was part of the job. Any job.” After Burrow was carted off the field midway through a loss to Washington last season, the Bengals lost to the Giants, Dolphins and Cowboys to fall to 2-10-1. They were routed by Baltimore in an especially unsightly season finale, but they’d battled past the Steelers and Titans before that. Those two victories without Burrow, the No 1 overall draft choice in 2020, might have bought Taylor one more year. It is possible that Burrow’s injury might have saved Taylor’s job, too, just because the quarterback was such an enormous part of the gigantic rebuild in Cincinnati. Burrow, who led LSU to the national championship after playing high school football 150 miles east of Cincinnati, was superb during the 2021 regular season, throwing for 4,611 yards and 34 touchdowns. Only Aaron Rodgers had a better passing rating among NFL starters. “We expect to beat everybody that we play – not just hang with them,” Burrow, the son of a football coach, said after the Raiders’ game. It helped that the Bengals won three of their first four games, and five of their first seven. But then came two ugly losses to the dismal Jets and to the division rival Browns, the team named after Paul Brown, and their hot start looked rather misleading. But Cincinnati have won seven of nine games since. The city, one of the smallest TV markets in the league, is delighted. The Bengals made the playoffs five straight years in the 2010s under longtime coach Marvin Lewis, but they lost all five of their playoff games, and Brown probably allowed Lewis to stick around a little too long. Taylor was just 35 when he was hired by the Bengals, with six years as an NFL assistant coach, none as a coordinator. An ESPN panel debated whether the Bengals had made a mistake before Taylor had even coached a single game. One of the talking heads, the former NFL coach John Fox, sounded less than convincing when he said of Taylor: “The Brown family has been around this league for a long time. They hired him because they’re thorough, and they believe he’s going to be the best guy for the future of their organization.” Then the Bengals started 0-11 (earning their first victory against, guess who else, the Jets) and sagged to 2-14 in Taylor’s first season. At least they earned the No 1 overall draft pick for the first time since 2003, when they chose Carson Palmer, who did not play at all as a rookie. Taylor started Burrow from Week 1. He won two of 10 starts before he got hurt, and Cincinnati won as many games without Burrow as with him. Then Burrow started slowly at training camp last summer. But Taylor said there was no reason to panic. His steady hand surely benefitted his players, who, as Taylor said in another news conference Sunday, “haven’t had an easy game in a long time.” His demeanor is pleasant if a little bland, and he often resorts to coachspeak, dodging chances to crow about himself. When Taylor was asked if he felt vindicated after two rough seasons, he replied, “I’m just happy for our team and our organization, to be honest with you.” He told the story of driving up to the tavern with the game ball. He was with two old friends and his young sons, and when he was asked if someone should tag along to take photos or shoot video, he said, no, he planned to just run in and duck out. He wanted a low-key deal. “Sure enough, there were 1,000 cell phones in there,” he said, smiling. “I don’t know what I was thinking was going to happen, but it was a good moment.” The Bengals are 3.5-point underdogs against the Titans, so the ride might end this weekend. But the owner has not seen the need to issue statements about the coach’s future, because Zac Taylor will be around to bag himself a few more stripes.

She remains trapped and fearful for her and her sisters’ future. Afghanistan: the left behind The crowds fighting to get into Kabul airport for evacuation dispersed months ago, but while the scramble to leave Taliban-controlled Afghanistan became less visible when the last foreign troops left in August 2021, it got no less desperate. Since then, reprisal killings have regularly been reported from across the country, including dozens detailed in a recent report from Human Rights Watch.  For those still in Afghanistan, living in hiding or in permanent fear for months now, the dangers seem to be increasing as the options for escape narrow. The UK government has tightened rules for its ARAP visa programme for former employees. A second scheme offering a path to safety to a wider section of Afghans at risk was heavily promoted by the government but it only began operating this month, and there are no details of how individuals can apply. And while the Taliban have largely kept a promise to allow those with tickets and documents to fly out, Afghan passports are difficult to secure , visas are even more challenging, and flights are still prohibitively expensive. This series features the stories of those who are trapped, in Afghanistan or in limbo as they search for safe haven, fearing for their lives from Taliban attacks or through hunger because they cannot work. Emma Graham-Harrison  I currently live in Pakistan with my family. Before I left Afghanistan, I was working as a programme administrator for an NGO and I also studied business at university. When the Taliban took over, I had no certain future. My education was not clear; my school was closed. I was happy before the Taliban took over. This semester we were supposed to have in-person classes. We had online classes because of the coronavirus, but it was so difficult because we didn’t have a good internet connection. So I was like a child preparing for the first day of school when we got told we could come back to the class. I was so happy and ready to go and sit in my class and learn. What followed was worse than I could ever imagine. I never thought that everything could vanish like that. My sister is in grade 12 and supposed to graduate high school. But after the collapse of Kabul, we had no choice but to leave. I don’t see any future for her. When I see her, my tears come. I can’t control them. She does not have any future and as a sister I can’t do anything for her. In Kabul, I was always wandering around my room. Sometimes at midnight, I’d wake up and think of what comes next. I was always praying for God to save my siblings, to save my parents. We decided to leave a month ago when we saw the situation getting worse; people are dying in the streets and their homes, and there’s no justice. There is no certainty and no security. We didn’t know when or for what reason we would be killed. We left the country and we came here [to Pakistan], but the struggle is the same. I don’t see any future for myself or for my siblings. But I am at least happy; I saved my life and my family’s. I applied for the UK evacuation scheme because of my work and my [other] sister is an artist and journalist. But still we have not heard anything specific from them. Sometimes I receive emails but as much as I reply, they do not respond telling me exactly what I should do. We are just waiting here. I wish I could explain the difficulties we go through. We don’t have a place to live, everything is more expensive and people live on the street, and you don’t know the language. My siblings don’t have any access to school. It is like being imprisoned in a house, in a room. I wish I could tell the UK government there’s so many other people who are waiting for a better future or so many other people who are displaced.

1/19/2022,"Pub chain JD Wetherspoon has criticised the government’s “hypocrisy” for holding parties at 10 Downing Street while restrictions forced pub sales to crash. Wetherspoon also said the latest plan B restrictions brought in at the start of the Omicron wave of infections in December had depressed sales over the crucial festive period in the hospitality sector for a second year running.  The pub chain, run by chairman and founder Tim Martin, directed its ire at the government over “partygate”. Wetherspoon said “there would have been a number of advantages for the nation” if pubs had been open on 20 May 2020, the date on which embattled prime minister attended a “bring your own booze” party in the garden of No 10. The trading update alleged that Covid-19 controls in pubs at the time “were superior to private parties”. It argued that this was true because “no outbreaks of the virus among customers” were reported in public health data, although it did not cite any specific evidence for the claim. Scientific modelling has repeatedly suggested that limiting crowded gatherings helps to reduce coronavirus infections. The update on Wednesday also claimed that staff in Wetherspoon’s pubs “would have easily dealt with the ‘high jinks’ alleged to have occurred at No 10” and that CCTV in central London pubs would have helped “subsequent inquiries” into the parties. Although the update to the City on Wednesday was not signed, Martin has a long history of using them to hit back at critics or to highlight his personal political agendas, including prominent support for the Brexit vote that ushered Boris Johnson into power. In a statement attributed directly to Martin, he said: “The uncertainty created by the introduction of plan B Covid-19 measures makes predictions for sales and profits hazardous. “The company will be loss-making in the first half of the financial year, but hopes that, with the ending of restrictions, improved customer confidence and better weather, it will have a much stronger performance in the second half.” Like-for-like sales for the 12 weeks to 16 January 2022 were 15.6% down on the same period a year ago, as the rise of Omicron infections ruined the second Christmas period in a row for British hospitality businesses.

Yesterday we brought you news that Atalanta had rejected their £25m offer for Duván Zapata and 24 hours later it is reported they’ve agreed personal terms with the Colombian striker’s team-mate Robin Gosens. The German left wing-back is believed to be open to a move to Tyneside, which is no great surprise given Newcastle are prepared to triple his wages. It remains to be seen if Atalanta will be prepared to sell him. In other left-back news, the Geordies are also sniffing around Bayer Leverkusen’s 21-year-old Dutch defender Mitchel Bakker, while the name of Fenerbahçe centre-half Attila Szalai also features on their extremely long January shopping list.  Spanish newspaper Nacional claim Real Madrid have accepted a £33m (rising to £41m) bid from Newcastle for Eden Hazard, but say the former Chelsea winger has turned his nose up at the prospect of a move to the struggling Premier League club. Currently plying his trade at Adana Demirspor, Mario Balotelli might not consider such a move beneath him. “Newcastle United were considering signing Balotelli, but so far they have not made us an offer,” said the Turkish outfit’s chairman Murat Sancak. “There is an exit clause in his contract. I will not tell you the number.” Arsenal’s hopes of signing Fiorentina striker Dusan Vlahovic in the current window look to have been dealt a significant blow, with reports from Italy suggesting the 21-year-old is hell-bent on going to Juventus and has already agreed personal terms with the Serie A club. Anthony Martial’s mooted loan move to Juve also seems to have hit the skids, after transfer rune-reader Fabrizio Romano revealed they are unwilling to meet the financial terms – a sizeable fee and all the player’s wages – laid out by Manchester United. Along with United, Juve are giving Borussia Mönchengladbach’s Swiss defensive midfielder Denis Zakaria the glad eye in a situation that could make or break Arsenal’s chances of bringing Arthur Melo to north London from Turin. Leeds United have had an initial bid of £15m for American international Brenden Aaronson rejected by RB Salzburg but remain hopeful of luring the midfielder to Elland Road before the end of the month. Meanwhile at Villa Park, Steven Gerrard could use his increasingly apparent pulling power to stage a reunion with another former Liverpool team-mate, Luis Suárez, when his contract with Atlético Madrid expires in June. The Uruguayan striker is believed to be enthused by the prospect of a summer move to the West Midlands and has already rejected overtures from a trio of Brazilian clubs in Palmeiras, Corinthians and Atlético Mineiro. Brentford’s audacious bid to land free agent Christian Eriksen could be scuppered by Tottenham Hotspur or Newcastle, who are also interested in offering the Danish midfielder a return to the Premier League. Meanwhile at Turf Moor, Burnley continue to be linked with extremely tall replacements for the recently departed Chris Wood, but are predicted to be unsuccessful in any attempt to land Christian Benteke from Crystal Palace or Richard Osman from House of Games.

And what particular sound are we talking about here? The sweet sound of a toilet flushing. So annoying! In our house we don’t flush in the night, unless, you know … This isn’t your house, though, or even their house. Whose house is it then? Where are we? Italy. Near Spezia, in the Liguria region. A couple in a flat complained that they couldn’t get a good night’s sleep after their neighbours – four brothers – installed a new bathroom. Would that be the Crappellotti brothers? No. Anyway, after a local judge dismissed their complaints the couple took the case to the court of appeal in Genoa. There was an investigation … Which found …? That the new bathroom was directly adjacent and that the water closet was actually built into the party wall. Farty wall! That’s pathetic; stop it. Also, it’s the flush that’s the problem, remember? What was the outcome? That it amounted to a violation of the couple’s rights, protected not just by the Italian constitution but also by the European convention on human rights (ECHR). The judge ordered the brothers to move the water tank and to pay the couple €500 a year from when it was installed in 2003. €1.37 for every night of disturbed sleep – you can’t even get an espresso for that, can you? That’s not really the point, though, is it? What is the point? Well, it’s about noisy neighbours, and human rights, and the ECHR protecting the right to respect for a person’s private and family life, and their home and their correspondence. What about Brexit Britain, though: flush away all night long? Go on, give it another for good measure. The UK is still a participant in the ECHR. For now … Anyway, back in Italy, was that the end of the story? Not quite. According to La Repubblica, the brothers took the case to the supreme court in Rome. And it ruled … That the sound of flushing coming through the wall exceeded the legal limit by three decibels … Only three decibels! Do they not have earplugs in Italy? Or couldn’t the couple put a bit of white noise on? Actually, three decibels is a significant increase in sound. Anyway, whose side are we on here? Oh yeah, that side: the human rights side. Anyway, the supreme court ruled that infringing on the right to rest had consequences for the constitutionally protected right to health. So the removal order was upheld? Yes. And the compensation. Let’s hope the brothers are quite flush, so it won’t be a problem for them. Do say: [Banging on the wall] “Oi, Giovanni! We hear you!
