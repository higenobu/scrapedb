3/31/2022,"More than a third of all compost sold in the UK in 2021 was peat dug from carbon-rich habitats, new data has revealed. The Horticultural Trades Association (HTA), which opposes a ban on peat sales, provided the figures in its response to a government consultation. The consultation proposes banning peat compost sales to gardeners by 2024 and ministers have said they aim to end sales to professional growers by 2028. An earlier voluntary goal of ending retail sales by 2020 failed. Almost 5 million cubic metres of compost was sold in 2021, with three-quarters bought by gardeners. But while only 30% of their purchases were peat, more than half the compost bought by horticulture businesses was peat. Overall, peat made up 35% of sales, down from 41% in 2020. Peatlands cover just 3% of the planet’s surface but hold twice as much carbon as all the world’s forests. The destruction and degradation of peatlands releases CO2 and drives the climate crisis. In the UK, 87% of peatlands are degraded and emit a combined 10m tonnes of CO2 a year. Dianna Kopansky, from the Global Peatlands Initiative at UN Environment, praised the UK government’s intention to end retail sales in 2024 but added: “Further action is needed to reduce the 1.7 million cubic metres of peat sold annually in the UK.” Monty Don, a gardener and broadcaster, said: “Peat extraction does great environmental harm [and] it is simply untrue that there are no viable alternatives. It is time for all gardeners to change, adapt, be creative and accept that our gardens are inextricably connected to the wider environmental landscape.” In its consultation response, the HTA said an industry taskforce had pledged to end retail sales between 2025 and 2028 and horticultural sales between 2028 and 2030. “A ban is unnecessary,” it said. “Government actions should not harm an industry that at its very core contributes to excellent mental health and wellbeing, adds positively to the healthy eating agenda [and] enhances the environment.” The HTA claimed: “The removal of peat in horticulture without a commercially viable alternative material may have unintended consequences eg food security and access to affordable food.” It also wants exemptions for plug plants and mushroom production. The Royal Horticultural Society now sells only peat-free compost and its director of science and collections, Prof Alistair Griffiths, said the end of all peat sales should come as fast as possible: “Peatlands are the world’s largest carbon store and provide valuable ecosystems for wildlife as well as important water services.” Kathryn Brown, the director of climate change and evidence at The Wildlife Trusts, said: “There are no uses of peat in horticulture which can justify the detrimental impacts of its extraction.” The government consultation contains alternative measures that fall short of an outright ban, including an additional charge on the price of peat compost, or the provision of information on the environmental impact of peat at the point of sale. The government said it did not intend to ban the sale of plants in pots that contained peat. Much of the UK’s peat is imported from the Republic of Ireland and other EU nations. Ireland’s state-backed company Bord na Móna ended all peat extraction in 2020, although its reserves are still being sold. Kopansky said: “With the end of peat harvesting by Bord na Móna, there has never been a better time to invest in sustainable alternative growing media and transition away from using peat.” Some big retailers of peat have implemented their own bans, including Dobbies and the Co-op in 2021, and B&Q by 2023. Sustainable alternatives to peat include compost made from wood fibre and bark, wool, coir, and garden waste.",News/Environment,Third of all compost sold in UK is climate-damaging peat,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/31/third-of-all-compost-sold-in-uk-is-climate-damaging-peat
3/31/2022,"A man has said he is willing to starve himself to death if the energy minister, Greg Hands, does not offer all MPs the same climate crisis briefing that Boris Johnson has described as his “road to Damascus moment”. For 18 days, Angus Rose, 52, has gone without food. Each morning he goes to Westminster to sit at the gates of parliament on a wooden folding chair, by a blown-up copy of a letter to Hands, in the hope the minister will meet him to talk. So far he has lost 9.5kg (1st 5lb) in weight but Hands has not shown up. “I have said to him that I will continue not eating until he arranges a briefing where Sir Patrick Vallance will brief parliament and the cabinet and make the recording available to be televised,” said Rose. “So all of the pressure is on his shoulders. So he can’t escape it. He can’t just kind of continue. He can’t escape that pressure. He can’t deflect it. It’s ever-present.” Rose has eaten nothing containing calories since 14 March. He allows himself zero-calorie drinks, such as water, coffee and green tea, and is taking vitamin supplements to stave off the worst effects of malnutrition, which can lead to cognitive impairments and heart arrhythmias. He speaks passionately but occasionally falters or becomes confused because lack of food has affected his ability to concentrate. Hands did not respond to a request for comment. But Rose said he had received a letter in reply from the minister. “He said: ‘I urge you to reconsider,’” Rose said. “So I replied to him and said: ‘Well, thank you very much for being concerned about my health. I pretty much acknowledge that the government has climate change as one of the top priorities, although I don’t recognise many of those priorities being as high as climate change. I believe climate change is the biggest issue.’” On 28 January 2020, the prime minister was given a briefing led by Vallance on the science of the climate emergency. Johnson, who had disputed climate scientists’ claims in the past, later said it had been his “road to Damascus” moment on climate science. He told reporters government scientists had “run through it all” and that anthropogenic climate change had turned out to be “very hard to dispute”. Rose’s action is part of a growing trend for activists to put pressure on climate policy through hunger strikes. Last October, around the time of the Cop26 climate summit, five young activists began a hunger strike outside the White House to pressure Joe Biden not to abandon his climate agenda. In December, Emma Smart, from the civil disobedience group Insulate Britain, ended a 26-day prison hunger strike in demand for a meeting with the Conservative MP Richard Drax. Rose said he had taken the most inspiration from Guillermo Fernandez, a Swiss father who claimed a victory after 39 days of hunger strike when scientists announced they would meet Swiss MPs to discuss climate science. “His demand was pretty much a demand that I have. So that’s where I got it from. And so it’s really disproportionate: the reasonableness of the demand is totally out of proportion to the level of sacrifice.” Fernandez had said he was doing it for his children; Rose says he is doing it for his five nephews and niece. The impacts of climate change would become “the worst case of intergenerational injustice inflicted by one human generation upon another”, he said. “This isn’t a joke. My nephews, my niece, their lives depend on the government to act, to protect, the most important duty to the citizens is to protect them from harm, and even more importantly for children and further generations,” Rose said.",News/Environment,Man on Westminster hunger strike fighting for MPs to get climate briefing,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/31/man-on-westminster-hunger-strike-fighting-for-mps-to-get-climate-briefing
3/31/2022,"We are thinking about hosting a refugee from the Ukraine. Since insurers are not renowned for their humanitarian instincts, would premiums increase or would a new policy be required?PN, Leicester The government’s U-turn on refugees was so sudden civil servants and the financial sector seem to have been caught on the hop. Mortgages and lease terms could also potentially be breached by long-term guests, but, at time of writing, the government FAQs are silent. Ordinarily, householders should inform their insurer and lender if a guest stays more than 90 days. However, the Association of British Insurers has announced that hosts need not notify their contents insurer of Ukrainian guests unless they stay longer than 12 months. The issue is more complicated if the guests are lodged in an annexe or second home, which could constitute a legal tenancy. Policyholders in this situation must, therefore, inform their insurer. UK Finance, which represents lenders, told me it’s still discussing details with the government. Much will depend on the wording of the government guidance, yet to be issued. If there’s a whiff of a legal contract between host and guests, there will be less leeway for flexibility. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) tells me it’s “encouraging” lenders to be accommodating, but borrowers would be wise to inform their lender until the situation is clearer. JH of Oxford has, meanwhile, been wondering about the effect on single-occupancy council tax discounts. “I live on my own and have signed up to the scheme but I don’t know how many I might be hosting,” she writes. “If my council tax is increased, the £350 a month from the government will not cover it.” The DLUHC says it “intends” discounts should not be affected.

3/31/2022,"Arriving in Shakespeare’s Forest of Arden, Celia in As You Like It declares: “I like this place. And willingly could waste my time in it.” For a slow travel escape, Warwickshire is sometimes overshadowed by the neighbouring Cotswolds and Oxfordshire. But culturally, historically, geographically, it is Shakespeare’s homeland and England’s ancient heart. From Marylebone station, the train to Leamington Spa powers through the Chilterns in just under 90 minutes. Sheep-freckled farms slope up to grassy hill forts under circling red kites, and a fox runs through fields among white splashes of blackthorn blossom. The branch line for Stratford-upon-Avon signals a shift of tempo: Claverdon, Bearley, Wilmcote… the station names have an Elizabethan air. By lunchtime I’m climbing the Welcombe Hills, following part of the 625-mile Monarch’s Way, a long-distance footpath tracing the route of King Charles II as he fled Cromwell’s forces after the Battle of Worcester in 1651. Eleven miles of the route, heading north out of Stratford, will bring me to the village of Wootton Wawen, with its regular trains and buses. I reach an apple orchard and buy a bottle of pressed juice. Lunch, soon after, is garden salad and gooey treacle tart at The Farm. The Monarch’s Way runs right past this popular shop and cafe, through fields of baby goats and highland cows, colourful plots of spring veg and a Gloucestershire Old Spot churning up a paddock ready for this summer’s sunflowers. The afternoon miles pass quicker. In Shakespeare’s The Winter’s Tale, Autolycus the peddler first arrives on stage singing a song about “the sweet of the year”, full of budding daffodils and tumbling in the hay, and exits with a verse about walking: Jog on, jog on, the footpath way / And merrily hent the stile-a / A merry heart goes all the day / Your sad tires in a mile-a. There’s often more of Shakespeare out here in the Warwickshire countryside than in Stratford itself, with its coachloads of tourists and models of Big Ben for sale. I dally along primrose-bordered paths, past banks of violets and starry yellow celandines. The last stretch of the route follows a canal-side towpath over an aqueduct and passes St Peter’s church in Wootton Wawen, with its Saxon core, statue of a bearded 15th-century knight and carved stone faces. Much Ado About Nothing is on this evening at Stratford’s Royal Shakespeare theatre, four minutes’ walk from the Townhouse hotel, where I’m staying. Behind its castellated facade are 11 bedrooms and a maze of stairways. The Tudor and Georgian building overlooks Shakespeare’s timber-framed school (open every day except Christmas and Boxing Day, £10/£6.50 for adults/kids). Two pre-theatre courses in the Townhouse restaurant cost £15; crispy tempura veg and hearty pasta are welcome after my afternoon hike. Strolling over cobbles to the theatre, I can hear a blackbird singing in the garden of New Place, Shakespeare’s family home for two decades (open from 26 March, £15/10.50 for adults/kids). The play itself is a triumph of spectacular style over subtlety (tickets from £16). There are live musicians, a gold fountain with real water, showstopping Afrofuturist costumes and a glowing Dr Seuss-style set. With some great moments (Don John’s demonic chuckle, Beatrice hiding behind a neon wheelbarrow), it’s a mesmerising night out. Next day, I visit two Warwickshire landmarks, whose attractions could each fill a day. Compton Verney is an art gallery, landscaped park, folk museum and grand mansion all rolled into one (£17/free for adults/kids). Bus 77 from Stratford stops every couple of hours right by the wrought iron gates and all visitors walk (or ride the shuttle bus) through grounds that are classic Capability Brown: palladian bridges over a long lake, where shaded snowdrops are still drifting down to the water’s edge, paths winding through wild daffs near a thatched ice house, and stately cedars of Lebanon. Peter Hall filmed A Midsummer Night’s Dream here in 1968 with, among other now-famous cast members, Judi Dench as Titania. Inside Compton Verney there are royal Tudor portraits, a nude Venus by Cranach, an elegant hall designed by British neoclassical architect Robert Adam, changing exhibitions, and the UK’s biggest collection of British folk art. Bus 77 goes on, past views of Edgehill (of civil war fame) and suburban roads with names like Banquo Approach and Laertes Grove, into Leamington Spa. There are frequent trains and buses to Warwick, but I stroll a couple of miles instead along the signed Riverside Walk that connects the Leam and Avon via a rural stretch of canal. Crocuses carpet the parks and another aqueduct carries the canal over the Avon, where a swan glides slowly under yellow-green willows. I reach Warwick Castle (tickets from £18 in advance), where the entertainment includes a Horrible Histories maze and a walk-through Royal Weekend, featuring uncanny waxwork Victorians like Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick, who inspired the song Daisy, Daisy. Don’t miss the views from the top of the Conqueror’s Fortress, the original motte where Warwick’s first wooden keep was built in 1068. Nearby, the falconer shows off the castle’s resident kites and eagles while jewel-bright peacocks pick their way among flowers and topiary near the conservatory. Bus X18 heads back to Stratford from outside the castle walls. At Coughton (“coat-en”) Court next morning, the riverside walk is fringed with purple wood anemones, nodding hellebores and pungent bright green wild garlic. Thousands of daffodils surround this Tudor National Trust house, seat of the Throckmorton family since the 15th century. Bus X19 stops nearby. Geese range through the orchard and a tall heron rises from the ferns and kingcups in the Bog Garden. A six-mile walk through the nearby countryside passes some of the young groves of the Heart of England Forest project, which aims to create 30,000 acres of woodland in Warwickshire and Worcestershire. The older woods, once a medieval deer park, are bristling with bluebell leaves. Heading home later, via Coventry, I catch the leisurely X20. It calls itself the “Bard’s Bus” and trundles past half-timbered Henley-in-Arden and the brick cottages of Hampton-in-Arden, with a long loop through Solihull in between. The huge Forest of Arden, which gave these towns and villages their names, once stretched from Stratford to Tamworth and must have helped inspire Shakespeare’s wild forest of fools, lovers and exiles in As You Like It. Coventry is the UK City of Culture for 2021 and 2022. I get off the bus near the gold-lit Belgrade theatre and have curry in the cafe as the foyer begins to fill with this evening’s audience. Walking through the city, I look out for Show Windows, like the rainbow-coloured butterfly in Cafe Morso with maps of Coventry neighbourhoods embedded in its wings. An £82m redevelopment, which finished in autumn 2021, included decking the station with symbols of Coventry, like the city’s three spires and Lady Godiva. It also created a traffic-free route for pedestrians and the pathways across Greyfriars Green, currently lit blue and yellow for Ukraine, lead directly to the station – just 20 minutes by train from Birmingham New street and an hour from London Euston.

3/31/2022,"The principal of one of Brisbane’s largest independent schools, Citipointe Christian College, has formally resigned amid ongoing concerns about the school’s policies and attitudes towards LGBTQ+ students and staff. The principal, pastor Brian Mulheran, had been on extended leave since an aborted attempt to institute student enrolment contracts that insisted students could only be enrolled on the basis of “biological sex”. The contracts demanded families sign a “statement of faith” that described homosexual acts as “immoral” and “offensive to God”. Guardian Australia revealed earlier this month that – at the same time as the enrolment contracts – the school had restricted its counsellors from providing any support to students on matters of sexuality or gender, instead referring students wanting such support to external advisers. His resignation was announced in an email to teachers by Citipointe senior global pastor Mark Ramsey on Thursday – a day after Guardian Australia revealed the school had restricted its counsellors from discussing matters of sexuality or gender. “I wish to advise you that Ps Brian Mulheran has resigned from his position as principal of Citipointe Christian College,” Ramsey wrote. “[The International Network of Churches] continues to investigate the best outcomes in overall governance structures for the movement and the Citipointe committee of management is discussing suitable changes at the local level. “I would like to personally thank each and every one of you for your support to students and parents during this very difficult first term for the college.” Attempts have been made to contact Mulheran. Previously, Guardian Australia also revealed that Mulheran had lobbied senators to allow employers “the right to discriminate” against homosexuals; that teachers at the school have been asked to sign employment contracts that warn they could be sacked for being openly gay; and that the school and it parent megachurch have promoted conservative political activism, including within the Liberal National party. Amid furore about the contracts, Mulheran – a pastor with no formal teaching qualifications or registration – stood aside in February. Such qualifications are not required by principals in independent schools. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning His decision to take extended leave also came amid a formal review of the school’s accreditation and a number of discrimination complaints about the enrolment contracts lodged with the Queensland Human Rights Commission. Teachers have told Guardian Australia that since the furore in January and February, the school has lost several staff and has had significant trouble attracting new teachers. The parent church organisation, the International Network of Churches / Christian Outreach Centre, and its offshoot the Citipointe megachurch, have now withdrawn their controversial “statement of faith”. The school says it is rewording its employment conditions. At the same time, Mulheran has remained in the warm embrace of the Citipointe church. He was praised and given a standing ovation at a Sunday worship service in February after standing aside.

3/31/2022,"Scott Morrison and the New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, have failed in a bid to have the high court rule on their power to handpick candidates for the federal election. On the same day, the high court also refused to hear challenges to the federal Labor intervention in the Victorian branch. After a dramatic afternoon in court, it is now guaranteed that Labor’s Victorian candidates can contest the federal election, while the NSW Liberals must argue the legality of preselections in the NSW court of appeal. It comes after an extraordinary application from the attorney general, Michaelia Cash, intervening in support of Morrison and Perrottet, who all called for the dispute to be sent straight to the high court. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has blasted the move, questioning why “taxpayers are paying for the commonwealth’s most senior lawyer … to go to the high court to take sides in a NSW Liberal party factional war”. In question time Paul Fletcher, representing the attorney general, answered that the government had followed “protocols” and the case involved “important constitutional questions”. The NSW Liberal dispute was brought by Sydney businessman Matthew Camenzuli against the preselection of immigration minister, Alex Hawke, in Mitchell; environment minister Sussan Ley, in Farrer; and MP Trent Zimmerman, in North Sydney. But a ruling in Camenzuli’s favour would also imperil the right of a three-person committee, which includes Morrison and Perrottet, to handpick the candidates in a further five seats. Morrison and Perrottet asked the high court to remove the entire case from the NSW court of appeal, which is due to hear it on Friday, arguing that a lower court hearing the case would risk ongoing uncertainty as the loser could later appeal to the high court. Cash applied on Thursday to similarly seek the case to be moved to the high court. Cash was represented at the hearing by the solicitor general, Stephen Donaghue, who acknowledged he was in a “weak position” because the attorney general had not even decided yet whether to intervene in the case. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Donaghue argued the high court should take the case to resolve inconsistency between decisions of federal courts and courts of appeal about whether internal party disputes are matters on which courts can decide. This included a constitutional dimension of whether it is within courts’ power to make declarations about whether candidates are validly preselected, he argued. Chief justice Susan Kiefel described this as a “very tenuous” constitutional question, and warned that the effect would be to delay the matter, as the court of appeal is ready to hear it on Friday. Donaghue insisted that if there were a constitutional issue, a high court hearing was guaranteed as a matter of right. Camenzuli’s counsel, Scott Robertson, found an ingenious solution: the high court could agree to take the case, but then immediately remit it back to the NSW court of appeal for determination exercising federal jurisdiction. Robertson warned the case was urgent, with the May federal election able to be called as early as the weekend and nominations to close 10 days after the writs were issued. The utility of challenging preselections “diminishes hour by hour, day by day”, he said. Morrison and Perrottet’s counsel, Guy Reynolds, suggested the court of appeal hearing the case could cause delay by risking a further appeal to the high court, at even later notice. “You’re not scaring me,” chief justice Kiefel replied drily. “Urgency is a matter we deal with all the time. And you shouldn’t assume special leave would be granted.” Chief justice Kiefel sided with Camenzuli, ruling the case should be removed to the high court then remitted back to the NSW court of appeal for reasons of “urgency, efficiency and utility”. A spokesman for Cash said she had “not intervened” in the case and “no view on the merits of either case has been expressed”. “The application for removal to the high court was merely in recognition of the fact that a serious constitutional issue has been raised that needs to be determined.” Earlier, Kiefel and justice Stephen Gageler combined to defeat a bid by sections of the Victorian Labor party to overturn the federal intervention in the Victorian branch. The national executive’s takeover, triggered by allegations of branch-stacking, had twice been upheld by the Victorian supreme court and Victorian court of appeal. The Health Workers Union secretary Diana Asmar and other allies of the late senator, Kimberley Kitching, sought to challenge the takeover on the basis it disenfranchised Victorian members voting in preselections. But justices Kiefel and Gageler refused to grant the applicants special leave to appeal from the Victorian court of appeal. The decision is the end of the line for Asmar, and a win for Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, and national secretary, Paul Erickson, who in 2021 pushed on with preselections in Victoria despite the risk of a court later overturning the intervention.",News/Australia news,Morrison and Perrottet fail in bid to have high court resolve NSW preselection crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/31/morrison-and-perrottet-fail-in-bid-to-have-high-court-resolve-nsw-preselection-crisis
3/31/2022,"The British government has provided more than £5bn in the past three years to overseas energy and infrastructure projects linked to labour abuses and environmental damage, according to documents and interviews with workers. The funding – a combination of loans and guarantees – comes from the government’s export credit agency, UK Export Finance (UKEF), a government department to help UK companies access business contracts overseas. Since 2019, UKEF has allocated £5.24bn of taxpayer money to projects with the potential to cause “significant adverse environmental and/or social impacts” in countries across the Middle East, Africa and Asia, according to calculations by the Guardian based on disclosures by the agency. Oil refineries, power stations, and a large-scale liquified natural gas (LGN) project are among the high-risk “Category A projects”, to receive funding recently. UKEF undertook environmental and human rights reviews of the projects ahead of granting the funding. Despite recommendations to mitigate labour abuses, six migrant workers employed on Middle Eastern projects backed by UKEF have revealed low pay, safety hazards, excessive working hours, and the denial of freedom of movement as persistent issues. “UKEF financing is very specific and usually funds very big, very damaging infrastructure projects,” said Daniel Willis, policy and campaigns manager at campaign group Global Justice Now. “Human rights considerations are an afterthought, and due diligence seems to be approached as if it is just a box to tick.” A review of an oil refinery upgrade programme in Kuwait, obtained by a freedom of information request, shows that UKEF knew of worker issues before it provided a $179m (£135m) support package in 2019. Employees and contractors were commonly working more than the maximum overtime hours allowed by legislation, and 87% of workers surveyed had not received an employment contract, according to the UKEF’s review. About 90% of workers at Kuwait National Petroleum Company (KNPC) had also been charged illicit recruitment fees to secure their jobs. Some were living in sub-standard accommodation with no air-conditioning, despite summer temperatures reaching 54C in Kuwait, the review said. Gulam Siddique, 30, from India, who recently worked as an inspector at KNPC’s refineries, told the Guardian lower-skilled labourers were not treated well. “They are treated as slaves, working 12 hours a day in direct sunlight,” said Siddique. “There are health risks for those guys, from the gases released at the plant.” Several of the UK-backed projects are based in Middle Eastern countries, where the labourers’ freedom of movement is controlled under the kafala sponsorship system, which has been deemed abusive and exploitative by Human Rights Watch. Aditya*, 35, said he has been unable to leave his job in Oman. His employer is a sub-contractor involved in the construction of the country’s Duqm oil refinery project. Aditya said he worked 11-hour days, for $1.90 (£1.45) an hour. The Duqm oil refinery received £700m of UK funds in 2019. “The company has taken my passport,” said Aditya, also from India. “The accommodation is not comfortable. Five people sleep in one small room. Companies here are not giving good facilities to their workers.” Before awarding it $500m in 2019, a UKEF review flagged the Bahrain Petroleum Company (Bapco) oil refinery expansion project as having “forced and child labour and worker health and safety as potential project risks”. Rajesh*, who works at the Bapco refinery, said he was paid the equivalent of $2.50 (£1.90) an hour, not enough to support his wife and two young daughters back in India, he said. “The salary is not fair. I need more overtime because of my family,” he said. The dormitory accommodation provided by his company does not have functioning air conditioning, leaving him sweltering in the summer months. The protective clothing and equipment provided does not work properly, he added. “None of us wants to speak up and say it’s hazardous,” he said. “We are too afraid.” The UK government was recently sued by the environmental group Friends of the Earth (FoE) for providing $1.15bn to an LNG project in Cabo Delgado province, Mozambique, which it claims contravenes the Paris climate agreement. On 15 March, two high court judges issued a split decision over the funding, and the case will now go to appeal. The project “could emit up to 4.5bn tonnes of climate-wrecking greenhouse gases over its lifetime, more than the combined annual emissions of all 27 EU countries”, FoE stated. “Estimates suggest the construction phase of this project alone would increase Mozambique’s emissions by up to 10% by 2022.” The project has been embroiled in human rights issues. TotalEnergies, the major shareholder, has ordered the displacement of thousands of people from fishing and farming communities around the site, to a relocation village 10km inland. This has left them without livelihoods and insufficiently compensated, according to FoE. In April, TotalEnergies abandoned its work on the project after a violent uprising in the region – several months before the UKEF support package was finalised in August. However, the French firm has said it expects work to resume at some point in 2022. TotalEnergies, KNPC, Bapco and OQ – the developer of the Duqm refinery – did not respond to requests for comment. A UKEF spokesperson said: “We are aware of the issues recently highlighted to us regarding workers’ rights on these projects and are taking them extremely seriously. “We undertake thorough reviews to ensure the management of environmental and social impacts and risks, including those associated with worker welfare, meet international industry standards following the provision of our support. No aspect of our commercial relationship with any company prevents us from taking action so that these standards are met for the duration of our support.” * Names changed to protect identities",News/Global development,Britain hands billions to projects linked to labour abuse and climate damage,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/31/britain-hands-billions-to-projects-linked-to-labour-abuse-and-climate-damage
3/31/2022,"Hello, it’s Warren Murray wishing you good morning once again. Russia is building up its forces in readiness for new attacks in the Donbas region despite the planned resumption of peace talks on Friday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said. Moscow had claimed it was withdrawing to eastern Ukraine to focus on “liberating” the Donbas region – which includes besieged Mariupol – but Zelenskiy said Russian troops were being driven back around places like Chernihiv and Kyiv as “the consequence of our defenders’ work”. A possible shift in the military situation comes as the head of Britain’s spy services agency says Putin has been misinformed about the extent of Russian military failure because his advisers are too frightened to tell him the damning truth. Sir Jeremy Fleming, speaking in Australia, said the Russian leader had misjudged the strength of Ukrainian resistance, the western response and the ability of his forces to deliver a rapid victory. “And even though we believe Putin’s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth, what’s going on and the extent of these misjudgments must be crystal clear to the regime.” Russian troops were poorly equipped, suffering from low morale and refusing to carry out orders, Fleming said. In the US, the Biden administration is considering a plan to release roughly one million barrels of oil a day from US reserves for several months to combat rising fuel prices. Meanwhile Liz Truss, Britain’s foreign secretary, is due to land in India today to urge Narendra Modi’s government to reduce its strategic dependency on Russia – at the same time as her sparring partner Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, will be making his first visit to India since the invasion of Ukraine. And major jewellers including Tiffany, Chopard, Signet and Pandora have announced they will stop buying diamonds of Russian origin. Keep up with further developments at our live blog. ‘Not the whole story’ – Police are examining 600 cases linked to maternity practices at Shrewsbury and Telford hospital after a damning report into baby deaths condemned health staff for blaming mothers while ignoring their own catastrophic blunders. Health officials failed to undertake serious incident investigations, while deaths were dismissed or not investigated appropriately, the independent inquiry found, and a total of 201 babies and nine mothers could or would have survived if the NHS trust had provided better care. There were also 29 cases where babies suffered severe brain injuries and 65 incidents of cerebral palsy. Rhiannon Davies, one of the mothers who fought for justice after her daughter Kate died in 2009, said the numbers themselves did “not tell the whole story” of the impact on families. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, issued a Commons apology for the failings: “We entrust the NHS with our care, often when we’re at our most vulnerable. In return we expect the highest standards.” Louise Barnett, the chief executive at the Shrewsbury and Telford hospital NHS trust, said: “We offer our wholehearted apologies for the pain and distress caused by our failings as a trust.” One rule for them – Keir Starmer is headed to Bury to launch Labour’s five-week-long local elections battle with the slogan “On your side”, urging voters to send the Conservatives a message about the cost of living crisis and No 10 lockdown breaches.

The party launches its campaign with analysis claiming families will be £2,620 worse off even after Rishi Sunak cut fuel duty and raised the national insurance threshold. Other campaigns will be launched in Worthing and Derby. Labour will pledge to reform employment law to outlaw a repeat of the P&O sackings, and promise tougher action on crime with police hubs in every neighbourhood. ‘Lock down extreme porn’ – An “immediate and urgent” introduction of age checks is needed to stop children accessing extreme content on pornography websites, children’s charities say. In an open letter to the largest porn sites in the UK, the coalition led by Barnardo’s said this could not wait to be addressed as part of the online safety bill, which has yet to come into effect. Barnardo’s says its frontline workers have had to help children including a 15-year-old boy exposed to pornography during lockdown. He was arrested after exposing himself to an older woman and said he had been watching that kind of content online. A new YouGov poll shows that almost 70% of UK adults agree that extreme pornography that would be illegal to sell on a DVD should also be illegal online. Among parents and guardians the figure was 75%. Health cost of firewood – Air pollution from wood burning in homes is responsible for more than £1bn a year in health damage in the UK and €10bn (£8.5bn) across the EU, according to a report from the European Public Health Alliance. Health damage produced by all kinds of home heating adds up to €29bn a year, with wood burning the biggest single cause despite producing only 10-14% of the heat in homes. The report found heat pumps and solar water heaters produced no air pollution at homes using them. Air pollution is the single biggest environmental risk to health, causing millions of early deaths a year globally. The UK government’s proposed new air quality limits for 2040 would still allow twice as much dangerous PM2.5 particle pollution in England as the WHO recommends as an upper limit today. Faraway star – The most distant star ever seen, 12.9bn light years away, has been photographed by the Hubble space telescope in images that might never be possible again. The observation of the star, named Earendel (“morning star” in old English), was possible thanks to a rare cosmic alignment. Scientists estimate Earendel is at least 50 times the mass of the Sun and millions of times as bright, placing it among the most massive stars known. It showed up in pictures because of natural magnification by a huge galaxy cluster, WHL0137-08, which sits between us and Earendel. The cluster’s gravitational pull is so intense that light bends around it, creating a cosmic magnifying glass. In this way, scientists calculate that Earendel’s brightness was magnified by a factor of thousands. On Tuesday, Russia announced it would “radically reduce” its military activity in northern Ukraine, but the Ukrainian military warns that Russia’s statement is intended to mislead them.

The fall has been partly driven by continued lockdowns in China but it may help ease fears of soaring prices in the west.

3/31/2022,"The sea sparkles and laps against the shore of the Maresme coast, north of Barcelona, as the train runs alongside it, passing the few hopeful spring sunbathers and surfers. At points, Spain’s oldest train line runs so close to the shore it feels as if you’re travelling on the sea itself. Last Sunday, that could well have happened. Heavy waves took a giant bite out of the coast, threatening a section of the track with collapse and forcing the train company to lay on a bus service between La Pineda and Malgrat de Mar. It wasn’t the first time, and it won’t be the last: coastal erosion and rising sea levels have put the future of the famed Maresme line in jeopardy. In January 2020, storm Gloria battered the line with 3.6-metre (12ft) waves, causing widespread damage and putting several sections out of action. Adif, the company responsible for railway infrastructure, spent €12m (£10m) repairing and shoring up a 1.4-mile (2.2km) stretch of track and replacing a bridge. Smaller beaches were washed away entirely, removing even the thin buffer between trains and waves. “One more Gloria and that will be the end of the train line,” says Antoni Esteban of Preservem el Maresme, an umbrella organisation representing 115 community, conservation and other groups in the region. Opened in 1848, the Maresme line links Barcelona with Blanes, 70km away, at the edge of the Costa Brava. The service was conceived to transport the Barcelona bourgeoisie to their summer residences. Since the 1970s, the Maresme population has grown exponentially. The train now passes through 16 growing towns with a combined population of about 500,000. There are 37 beaches and five marinas along the way. On working days, about 100,000 people use the service, and in summer the trains are packed as people from Barcelona head for the beaches. However, rapid urbanisation of the Maresme towns has worsened coastal erosion. Human activity and canalisation of the rivers that drain into the sea mean less sediment is deposited, leading to greater erosion, says Joan Manuel Vilaplana, a geologist at the Observatori del GeoRisc research institute. The five marinas along the coast are also a contributing factor, Vilaplana says: “Ocean currents move the sand from north to south as part of a natural process of regenerating the beaches, but the marinas’ quays act as sedimentary traps.” A €50m plan to install 28 breakwaters, each 150 metres long, on the coastline may only make the problem worse. And, despite being agreed in 2015 by Adif and central, regional and local governments, it seems unlikely to be set in motion. Critics point out that in Barcelona, where a series of breakwaters was built to reduce erosion, less sand is reaching the beaches than ever. “Hard solutions such as breakwaters and sea walls simply aggravate the problem of erosion, so the cure is worse than the disease,” says Vilaplana. Pilar Marcos of Greenpeace agrees: “Building breakwaters is a huge outlay of public money that will solve nothing in the long term as storms get stronger and more frequent. It’s just a sticking plaster.” Not only are the storms worsening, rising sea levels mean the waves penetrate further inland. “Over the past 30 years, the sea level on the Catalan coast has been rising by 3.3mm a year,” says Vilaplana. “We have to rethink what we’re doing. Nature is doing its work, and climate change is causing it to accelerate.” Marcos says that local fishers complain about the impact on marine life of constantly dredging the seabed for sand to replenish the beaches after each winter’s storms. Joan Campolier, the mayor of Santa Susanna, which lies midway between Pineda de Mar and Malgrat de Mar, has called for a definitive solution, even if it means closing the line for longer. His counterpart in La Pineda, Xavier Amor, agrees, saying there is no point in trying to fix the problem by patching it up. Vilaplana believes the only long-term solution is to move the line inland, to run parallel with the motorway. Not only would this guarantee the safety and viability of the train – he says it is only luck that there hasn’t been a serious accident – it would free up land that would allow for wider beaches, which research shows is the best defence against erosion. Although there is widespread agreement that the line needs to move inland, he says the plan has been stalled by a lack of political will and, with an estimated cost of €30bn, cash. “It’s hard to justify doing nothing on economic grounds when they’re spending millions on high-speed rail links that no one is using,” Vilaplana says, a reference to Spain’s high-speed rail network, which is second only to China in distance covered but has struggled to find enough passengers to be financially viable. While moving the line inland may be the best environmental solution, thousands of commuters will lament the loss of the curious but joyous sensation of being on a train that seems to travel by sea.",News/Environment,"Last stop, underwater: the Spanish railway line being devoured by the sea",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/31/last-stop-underwater-the-spanish-railway-line-being-devoured-by-the-sea
3/31/2022,"When it comes to North Korean missile launches – and much else about the secretive regime – all may not be as it seems. Days after the regime claimed it had successfully tested its biggest intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), South Korea said it believed the launch had been faked. The “monster missile”, the South’s military said, was in fact a Hwasong-15 – a smaller projectile previously tested in 2017, the last time Pyongyang fired missiles potentially capable of striking anywhere on the US mainland. Even if last week’s launch, accompanied by a slick PR video showing the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, in a black leather jacket and aviator shades, was not of the more powerful Hwasong-17, there is agreement that the weapon flew further and higher than any other in the history of Pyongyang’s missile tests. The timing is significant, coming as US president Joe Biden’s attention is on the war in Ukraine – a reminder that North Korea’s sanctions-busting development of ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons is continuing with alarming speed. “Pyongyang might have thought it was safe to test more provocative weapons without drawing penalties while Washington and the world are preoccupied with Ukraine,” said Duyeon Kim, adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Washington. “North Korea usually has multiple objectives for every action. It may be gearing up for a tougher US-South Korea alliance after Yoon Suk-yeol’s presidential election victory while pushing ahead with preexisting plans to make hi-tech nuclear weapons as ordered by Kim Jong-un. It might also be aiming to mask any internal weakness through shows of strength before the North Korean people even if it has to be deceptive about them.” Despite reports that a Hwasong-17 had exploded in midair over Pyongyang in mid-March, reportedly in view of shocked residents of the capital, every significant missile launch is partly intended for Kim’s domestic audience. While the country battles food shortages and attempts to revive cross-border trade with China wrecked by two years of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions, Kim habitually uses weapons tests as an opportunity to demonise the US and reinforce the belief among the country’s 25 million people that their greatest existential threat comes not from economic mismanagement but from the “imperialists” other side of the Pacific. Above all, the first launch of an ICBM since November 2017 was a reminder to the US that despite years of UN security council sanctions, North Korea is quickly becoming a legitimate nuclear-armed state that Washington will have to treat as an equal if there is to be a return to Trump-era summitry. Although Biden has shown little interest in meeting Kim, North Korea can point to an increasingly impressive inventory of weapons, from a purported hypersonic missiles and smaller short-range solid-fuel missiles targeting South Korea, as an inducement to talk. In addition, analysts say the North could be planning another nuclear test – its seventh – to claim it has acquired the ability to produce a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on those missiles. “The offensive arithmetic will be in their favour soon; they may be able to keep up with advances in American defences,” Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the US-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said after the recent ICBM test. The North’s diplomatic calculation is the same now as it was when Kim signed up to a nebulously worded agreement to “denuclearise” the Korean peninsula at his first summit with Trump in June 2018, even though few analysts believed he had any intention of relinquishing his most effective deterrent and most powerful bargaining chip. Pyongyang’s goal seems to be to strengthen its leverage so it can turn denuclearisation talks into nuclear-reduction talks in exchange for economic aid. “The message of the North Korean readout of [the recent] ICBM launch is clear: North Korea will continue to develop its nuclear arsenal,” said Rachel Minyoung Lee at the Washington-based 38 North programme, which monitors North Korea. After a four-year hiatus, analysts say the ICBM test could be the opening gambit in a new phase of provocations reminiscent of the “fire and fury” days of 2017. “A nuclear test is possible,” Hyun-Wook Kim, professor and director-general at the Korea National Diplomatic Academy in Seoul, said, amid signs that work is under way to dig a shortcut to a tunnel at Punggye-ri, a nuclear test site the North “detonated” in 2018, weeks before Kim’s first summit with Trump. “I think North Korea will use this opportunity to continue its military provocations as a way of getting something from both the US and China,” he added. Duyeon Kim said it was “only a matter of time” before North Korea conducts a nuclear test, provided it stands to gain technologically or politically. “North Korea has every reason to raise tensions on the peninsula to gain leverage ahead of any future negotiations with Washington and to be accepted by the world as a permanent nuclear power,” she said.",News/World news,Testing times: why North Korea’s missile launches should worry the west,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/31/testing-times-why-north-koreas-missile-launches-should-worry-the-west
3/31/2022,"Ben Roberts-Smith ordered an SAS comrade to mock execute another Australian soldier during a training exercise, and told his patrol members “that’s how it’s going to be on the day”, the federal court has heard. Later, in Afghanistan, after an abortive mission to the Chora Valley, Roberts-Smith allegedly threatened the same comrade he could be reported “to the Hague” if he did not lie about firing his weapon near civilians. A former SAS soldier, anonymised before the court, has been subpoenaed to give evidence in court by three newspapers defending a defamation action brought by Roberts-Smith, his former comrade and Victoria Cross recipient. Roberts-Smith alleges the newspapers’ reports portrayed him as committing war crimes, including murder, as well as acts of bullying. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. Person 10 told the court he was on Roberts-Smith’s five-man SAS patrol in 2012. During pre-deployment training at Lancelin base in Western Australia, troops were practising taking control of compounds and ‘clearing’ them of insurgents. Person 10 said he was called into a room by Ben Roberts-Smith to see another Australian soldier, Person 9, playing the role of a prisoner, kneeling facing a wall. Person 10 said Roberts-Smith gave him an order. “He said words to the effect of ‘shoot him’.” “But it’s P9,” Person 10 told the court her replied. Person 10 said Roberts-Smith re-affirmed the order: “Shoot him.” “I went ‘bang bang’.” Roberts-Smith allegedly said to Person 10: “That’s how it’s going to be on the day.” Person 10 said after the training drill was completed, Person 9 said to him: “Don’t get involved in that shit. It’s not good.” Deployed to Afghanistan, on the patrol’s fourth mission, which was in the Chora Valley, Person 10 said he thought he detected a threat in a wadi - a dry river bed - where he had previously seen a “fighting aged male” dressed in black and acting suspiciously. Person 10 told the court he began firing his machine gun after shots were “fired in our general direction” - later understood to have come from another Australian SAS patrol. Person 10 said he engaged in “drake-firing” - firing at an area where a threat has been perceived - after he and his patrol were fired upon. He said he fired “no more than five” two-to-three round bursts and stopped firing after receiving an order from Roberts-Smith to “cease fire”. However, out of the wadi emerged not an insurgent, but a woman and a child, he told the court. During Person 10’s evidence-in-chief, the court heard Person 10 was also allegedly firing in the direction of other Australian troops, risking a potential “blue on blue” incident, an instance of friendly fire. Under cross-examination, Person 10 said he had been trained to drake fire when there was a perceived threat, and he did not know there were civilians in the river bed. He said he “did not fire willingly at a woman and child”. “We’d received incoming fire, and I’d been told we were ‘troops in contact’… At the time of engagement I was firing at insurgents.” Person 10 later said he was “made a scapegoat” for the failed Chora Valley mission. Drake-firing, the court heard, was within the rules of engagement when a soldier perceived their life or the lives of their comrades was at risk. Person 10 said after the mission ended, Roberts-Smith confronted him inside the soldiers’ patrol room. Person 10 told the court he was sitting on a couch when Roberts-Smith walked in and closed the door behind him. “Stand up,” Roberts-Smith allegedly told Person 10. “After I stood up, he punched me,” Person 10 told the court, saying Roberts-Smith struck him on the left jaw, forcing him backwards. “After that, I can’t recall what he said but he was shouting at me. “At the end he yelled ‘as far as I’m concerned that’s it. Nothing leaves this room’.” However later, when the SAS hierarchy was conducting an inquiry into the potential blue-on-blue incident, Person 10 said Roberts-Smith urged him to lie in his statement, so that it matched his own, and threatened him. “He said I could go to the the Hague [the International Criminal Court] if I said I was firing at a woman and child.” Following the incident, Person 10 was removed from Roberts-Smith’s patrol, and assigned to a different patrol, but he said his performance as a soldier deteriorated. “I noticed I was withdrawing a lot from my teammates. Essentially [I] started getting into depression, anxiety. I couldn’t think clearly, I couldn’t sleep.” Upon the troops’ return to Australia, Person 10 was given a notice to show cause why he should not be removed from the regiment. He told the court he received a phone call from Roberts-Smith in February 2013. “The crux of it was ‘if you threaten me or my family I will fuck you up’,” Person 10 told the court Roberts-Smith said to him. Person 10 said he understood the threat to mean: “if I stated that he punched me in my notice to show cause there would be consequences”. In the newspapers’ defence document filed with the court, they argue Roberts-Smith’s behaviour constituted bullying, and that he bore some responsibility for the failed Chora Valley mission. “It may be inferred that [Robert-Smith’s] conduct in respect of Person 10 was to detract attention from [Robert-Smith’s] own responsibility for planning a tactically flawed mission which contributed toward the blue on blue incident. Person 10 told the court in cross-examination his “slipping” performance as a soldier was not related only to Roberts-Smith, “I’d say it was the organisation [the SASR] as a whole”. He said his evidence was not motivated by personal malice against Roberts-Smith. “I hold nothing against Mr Roberts-Smith. I don’t want to be here [in court], I’m compelled to be here. I’m answering these questions honestly.” Roberts-Smith was questioned extensively about his relationship with Person 10 and the Chora Valley mission when he gave evidence in this trial last year. He was asked whether the mock execution happened. “No, it didn’t,” he said. “It’s just a ludicrous scenario. I don’t even know how someone would come up with that, quite frankly. It’s just just a stupid thing for someone to have said.” Roberts-Smith said the Chora valley mission was acutely dangerous because Person 10 “had totally lost his situational awareness, and he was shooting randomly”. “I still, to this day, I don’t believe he was trying to kill a woman and child. What I think is he just didn’t understand what was happening, for whatever reason, and lost control, and that’s what was dangerous about it.” Roberts-Smith said he told Person 10 he could have killed the woman and child and that “the other [Australian] team was on the other side”. “You could have been sitting here right now knowing that you killed one of your mates”. Roberts-Smith admitted that he punched Person 10 after the mission, and said he reported his actions to senior command. He told the court he never threatened Person 10 he might be sent to the Hague if he mentioned the woman and child. Person 10 remains in the witness box under cross-examination. The trial, before Justice Anthony Besanko, is expected to run several weeks more.",News/Australia news,"Ben Roberts-Smith ordered SAS comrade to mock execute another Australian soldier, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/31/ben-roberts-smith-ordered-sas-comrade-to-mock-execute-another-australian-soldier-court-hears
3/31/2022,"Even for experts who closely follow the US supreme court, there was something stunning about an emergency decision from the justices on Wednesday. In an unexpected move, the court decided to throw out new districts for the state legislature in Wisconsin that had been picked by the state supreme court. But what was even more surprising was that the court’s conservative majority seemed to go out of its way to attack the Voting Rights Act, one of the most important civil rights laws designed to prevent discrimination in US elections. “Extra headspinning,” was how Michael Li, a redistricting expert at the Brennan Center for Justice, described it. “Bizarre,” observed Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine. David Wasserman, a redistricting expert at the non-partisan Cook Political Report, tweeted that the supreme court had entered “uncharted territory”. The court’s decision in the Wisconsin case was the latest in a series of rulings that have left little pretense of how aggressively it is trying to weaken section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA), the most powerful provision of the law, which outlaws racially discriminatory voting practices. The court is not hiding its skepticism of the use of race in redistricting, even when it’s used to protect minority voters, and is making it harder for litigants to justify considering race when district lines are redrawn. “The supermajority of the conservative justices on the supreme court has become pretty emboldened. They’ve got a narrow vision of the scope of the Voting Rights Act. And they are not being shy about enforcing that as quickly as they can,” Hasen said in an interview. “The court is increasingly aggressive, and as a body is increasingly willingly to go out on a limb to fully implement the justices’ legal and political preferences without it being tempered by concern about perceptions and legitimacy.” The court’s hostility towards the Voting Rights Act comes at a moment when Republican legislatures across the US are passing a wave of new voting restrictions that many see as thinly veiled efforts to make it harder for Black and Latinx Americans to vote. Voting rights groups have fewer and fewer tools to challenge those restrictions. This is the first redistricting cycle since 1965 that states with a history of voting discrimination don’t have to get their maps pre-approved before they go into effect, under a provision of the Voting Rights Act. When the supreme court gutted that provision in 2013, Chief Justice John Roberts pointed to section 2 as a powerful tool litigants could use to challenge discriminatory voting laws. The court is now making it harder to win cases under that provision. The court has recently used a docket of emergency cases – called the shadow docket – to issue consequential voting rights rulings for two other cases with little reasoning or briefing – sometimes both. Last month, the court blocked a lower court’s ruling that would have required Alabama to implement an additional Black-majority congressional district. In another shadow docket ruling this month, three of the court’s justices embraced a fringe legal theory that courts cannot second-guess state legislatures on election matters. “It is a sign that many of the brakes have come off,” said Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin who studies the shadow docket. “It’s a sign that the court is increasingly willing to do whatever the court wants to do, procedural constraints and sort of awkward timing notwithstanding.” The Wisconsin case arrived at the supreme court after an unusual set of circumstances and was not really set up to be a consequential voting rights dispute. “It is the most disturbing aspect of this,” said Deuel Ross, an attorney at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund who frequently litigates section 2 redistricting cases. After the state’s Democratic governor and Republican legislature could not agree on a map, the state supreme court picked one that added an additional Black state assembly district near Milwaukee to account for Black population growth. The Republican legislature objected to the use of race in drawing that district and made an emergency request to the US supreme court to block the map from going into effect. The supreme court had options. It could have granted that request and requested further briefing and oral argument. It could have rejected the request and waited for a full challenge to the new district to work its way through lower courts, where there would have been extensive evidence submitted about whether the additional district was needed. Instead, it issued an unsigned seven-page order telling the Wisconsin supreme court what was needed to justify drawing an additional district. “The question that our VRA precedents ask and the court failed to answer is whether a race-neutral alternative that did not add a seventh majority-black district would deny black voters equal political opportunity,” the court wrote. “It’s just really a signal that they don’t like the VRA and they wanted to say something about the VRA,” Li said. “It’s not even well hidden now. It’s like they’re gunning for the VRA. “This is a court that’s not comfortable sorting voters into districts based on race and wants to know why you’re doing that,” he added. “The real question is whether they reformulate the test in a way that makes it practically impossible to ever win a section 2 case or whether there’s some reasonable universe of cases that survives.” Another reason the Wisconsin decision was so notable was its timing. The supreme court has embraced a general idea recently, called the Purcell principle, that courts should not intervene in election disputes when an election is close. Candidates are set to begin circulating petitions for office in just a few weeks and Wisconsin’s primary is set for 9 August. The Wisconsin Elections Commission, which oversees elections in the state, told the US supreme court any decision later than 15 March would “increase the risk of errors”. The supreme court issued its ruling sending Wisconsin back to the map drawing board eight days after that deadline. That timing raised eyebrows because of a decision written by Justices Kavanaugh and Alito in the Alabama case. Writing in early February, the two conservative justices said it was too close to Alabama’s 24 May election to justify imposing new maps. But in a different redistricting case in North Carolina in early March, Alito wrote a ruling, joined by Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas, saying it was not too close to North Carolina’s 17 March primary to overturn maps that were being challenged there. “The obvious cynical explanation is that when the Purcell principle helps Republicans, apply it. And don’t when it hurts them,” Hasen said. Ross, the LDF attorney, said the supreme court’s ruling underscored the need to look elsewhere to protect voting rights. “It’s been a long time since the courts were the saviors of our democracy,” he said. “As the courts become less and less responsive to these kinds of claims, it becomes more important that people are engaged not just at the national level … but what’s happening at the local level of what’s happening at your city council, school commission. “All of that becomes more important, the less the court is responsive to voters of color under the Voting Rights Act.”",News/US news,The US supreme court’s assault on voting rights hits a new low,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/31/supreme-court-assault-voting-rights-new-low
3/31/2022,"The North Carolina congressman Madison Cawthorn will not face immediate disciplinary action over his claim to have been invited to orgies and to have seen Washington figures using cocaine. After meeting Cawthorn on Wednesday, the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, told reporters the comments were “unacceptable”. “There’s a lot of different things that can happen,” McCarthy added, regarding possible consequences. “I just told him he’s lost my trust, he’s gonna have to earn it back, and I laid out everything I find is unbecoming. And you can’t just say, ‘You can’t do this again.’ I mean, he’s got a lot of members very upset.” Cawthorn is a rightwing gadfly, controversialist and Trump supporter. He made the remarks about orgies and drugs in an interview with a podcast, Warrior Poet Society, posted online last week. Asked if the Netflix hit House of Cards, about amoral Washington politicians and fixers, was anything like reality, Cawthorn said: “The only thing that isn’t accurate about that show is that you could never get a piece of legislation about education passed that quickly.” The 26-year-old added: “I mean, being kind of a young guy in Washington, where the average age is probably 60 or 70 – you know, I look at all these people, a lot of them that I’ve looked up to through my life – I’ve always paid attention to politics. “Then all of the sudden you get invited to, ‘Well, hey, we’re going to have kind of a sexual get together at one of our homes, you should come.’ “I’m like, ‘What did you just ask me to come to?’ And then you realise they are asking you to come to an orgy.” The Republican also claimed: “You know, some of the people that are leading on the movement to try and remove addiction in our country and then you watch them do, you know, a key bump of cocaine right in front of you and it’s like, ‘Wow, this is wild.’” “Key bump” is a slang term for a small amount of cocaine. McCarthy met Cawthorn with the Republican chief whip, Steve Scalise, in attendance. According to the minority leader, Cawthorn admitted some of his remarks had been untrue or exaggerated. “In the interview,” McCarthy said, “he claims he watched people do cocaine. Then when he comes in he … says he thinks he saw maybe a staffer in a parking garage from 100 yards away. “It’s just frustrating. There’s no evidence behind his statements … I told him you can’t make statements like that, as a member of Congress, that affect everybody else and the country as a whole.” Cawthorn did not immediately comment. McCarthy fielded complaints about Cawthorn’s remarks from numerous House Republicans. Senators weighed in too. But on Wednesday McCarthy and Scalise told reporters they would wait to see how Cawthorn behaves before considering disciplinary action. Scalise said: “Obviously, the ball’s in his court in terms of how to respond but we were very clear with the concerns we had.” Cawthorn is a vocal member of the powerful far right of the House Republican caucus. McCarthy is aiming to become speaker next year. On Wednesday a prominent House Democrat, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, asked on Twitter why “Republicans are acting so shocked by Cawthorn’s alleged revelations about their party. “One of their members [Matt Gaetz of Florida, another fa-right congressman] is being investigated for sex trafficking a minor and they’ve been pretty OK w[ith] that. They issued more consequences to members who voted to impeach Trump.”",News/US news,Congressman Madison Cawthorn under fire over claims of DC drugs and orgies,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/30/madison-cawthorn-washington-orgies-cocaine-claims
3/31/2022,"An “immediate and urgent” introduction of age verification is needed to stop children accessing extreme content on pornography websites, children’s charities have warned. In a strongly worded open letter to the largest pornography sites in the UK, a coalition of charities and child safety experts led by Barnardo’s said the harm being done to children was so severe that the issue could not wait to be addressed as part of the online safety bill, which has yet to come into effect. “The new laws take up to three years to come into force, and in the meantime millions of children could be seeing harmful content millions of times over, with serious consequences for their mental health,” said Barnardo’s chief executive, Lynn Perry. The coalition, which includes teaching unions, politicians and children’s experts, has also drawn attention to the extreme nature of content on some of the most popular sites, including child abuse, fantasies of men exposing themselves and rape fantasies performed by adults. The Guardian has previously reported on concerns around pornography that fetishises child abuse, rape, incest and so-called “revenge porn”. Barnardo’s said: “Many commercial pornography websites feature depictions of practices that meet the definition of criminal standards of sexual violence, including rape, incest and so called ‘revenge porn’, which would be illegal to buy in the UK.” Barnardo’s says its frontline workers are having to help children who have been seriously affected by seeing extreme material. One 15-year-old boy went from spending hours outdoors to watching pornography during lockdown. He was arrested after exposing himself to an older woman, and disclosed that he had been specifically viewing content that portrayed men exposing themselves in public to women who enjoyed this and then engaged with the men sexually. Barnardo’s professionals who supported the boy felt his actions were directly linked to what he had seen online. A new YouGov poll shows that almost 70% of UK adults agree that extreme pornography that would be illegal to sell on a DVD should also be illegal online. This compares with just 10% who disagree. Among parents the figure was higher, with 75% of parents and guardians agreeing that extreme pornography should be illegal online compared with 62% of adults who did not look after children. The British Board of Film Classification has backed the call for similar restrictions to apply to pornography sites. While politicians have so far mainly focused on children’s access to pornography, charities hope that now the online safety bill has been published there will be a debate in parliament on the nature of the material as well. Vanessa Morse, head of Cease UK (Centre to End All Sexual Exploitation), said the fetishisation of abuse needs to be controlled far more stringently. “The money the porn industry makes from these pseudo child abuse videos and rape fantasies is staggering, and the vast quantities of pseudo abuse material on porn sites is normalising extreme preferences and making it harder to identify real abuse that might be posted on these sites. This week’s call from charities acknowledges that steps have been taken to protect children, such as MindGeek – which owns Pornhub – removing all non-verified user videos from their sites. This happened after real videos of children were found on the site, leading the two main credit card companies, Mastercard and Visa, to withdraw their involvement with Pornhub. The policy of introducing age checks on pornography sites was first announced by the Conservatives during the 2015 general election campaign but has repeatedly run into difficulties. The government said that any age-assurance method used by pornography sites would have to protect users’ privacy. MindGeek has been contacted for comment.",News/Global development,"Age checks needed urgently to protect children from online porn, say charities",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/31/age-checks-needed-urgently-to-protect-children-from-online-porn-say-charities
