3/24/2022,"Climate change protesters who have caused blockades at Sydney’s major port this week say tougher penalties and the deportation of two activists will not stop them from continuing their campaign. The New South Wales government announced on Thursday that it would ramp up its response to protests by the climate group Blockade Australia, including the creation of a strike force aimed at disrupting activists, increased penalties and possible jail time. The penalties, including fines of $22,000 and up to two years jail time for people who blockade tunnels and bridges, follow three days of protests around the port which have seen the arrests of five people including two German nationals. The German nationals, who are brothers, have since had their visas cancelled. The immigration minister, Alex Hawke, confirmed on Thursday they would be deported over their involvement in the protests this week, which blocked peak-hour traffic around Port Botany. One of the brothers has been refused bail and will face court against next week. After days of protests – and campaigning from Sydney radio station 2GB – the state’s acting premier, Paul Toole, held two separate press conferences on Thursday in which he also foreshadowed further “tough laws” to target protesters. The government will also bring legislation to parliament which would expand the law to include roads and other major industrial and transport facilities. “Groups like Blockade Australia, they have gotten a lot smarter than ever before. They’ve got legal teams that are actually doing work for them to actually work out what the penalties might be,” Toole told reporters. “Enough is enough.” He also welcomed the cancellation of the visas of the two German nationals, saying: “Good riddance, we don’t want you here. “They’ve got no place here in this country,” he said. Toole called the protests a “kick in the guts” for farmers and miners, and said the decision to block traffic and slow the port’s operations was “disgraceful”. Later on Thursday, Toole announced the establishment of a police strike force to “disrupt” the protesters, with assistant commissioner Peter Cotter flagging a heavy police presence and the use of proactive policing and stop and search powers in and around the port.

Among the five people arrested this week were 57-year-old preschool teacher Dominique Jacobs from Gloucester in the Hunter Valley and 71-year-old psychologist Helen Kvelde. On Wednesday afternoon they blocked a major road into the port with two trucks. Kvelde locked herself to the steering wheel with a bike lock while Jacobs climbed on top of the second truck and unfurled a banner reading “don’t negotiate with climate criminals”. While the threat of increased punishments was daunting, both women said it would not have stopped them taking the action. “It wouldn’t make a scrap of difference to me,” Jacobs said. “I’m more frightened of the climate emergency than I am of their harsher penalties.” Kvedle, a longtime environmental activist who lives in regional NSW, accused the government of “cynicism” for introducing the penalties. “They only care about money and they only want to stop people who might be affecting the economy,” she said.

One of the important things is to acknowledge that all of those actions by the government is to do just that. It’s to instil fear in people.” The new penalties were supported by the Labor leader, Chris Minns, who dismissed fears that the extension of police powers posed a threat to civil liberties, saying the protests had caused “serious damage to the NSW economy”. “It’s almost impossible to think of anything more disruptive, or damaging to the environmental cause, or the cause for climate change than the actions of these people,” he said. “At the very moment when we’re trying to build a coalition around climate change, to make it a mainstream issue and to ensure that it has bipartisan support and the support of millions of people right across Australia, but in particular in Sydney, in western Sydney, this is one of the most damaging things that anybody could do.” But the Greens MP David Shoebridge savaged the government, calling it a “politically motivated crackdown on legitimate political expression”. “This isn’t the first time the Coalition has moved to criminalise protest, having already put in place harsh criminal penalties for any protest that disrupts fossil fuel production,” he said. “In the face of global wars and human rights abuses and with our own communities reeling from catastrophic floods made worse by climate change, the right to demand action on climate and to defend human rights must be protected. “Every tonne of coal, oil and gas we burn will increase the intensity and speed of climate change– the activists standing up to stop this should be congratulated, not arrested.”",News/Australia news,Activists dismiss NSW government crackdown on Sydney port protests,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/24/activists-dismiss-nsw-government-crackdown-on-sydney-port-protests
3/24/2022,"After two jabs in a vaccine trial, and three Pfizers, I was sure my defences were rock solid, impregnable. Turns out they were unbreachable only in the sense that the Maginot line was unbreachable. Like Axis forces in 1940, the subvariant of the Omicron variant – or whatever they’re saying it is – found a way around the undefended flanks of my antibodies. Yes, I finally got Covid. Yes, I know, yawn. As my elder daughter said to me: “It’s so uncool to get Covid now.” I was in south Wales with her and our dog when I got my first-ever second red line. Feeling decidedly awful, I took to my bed. “You’re being very 2020 about this,” she said. Not long after, she packed her bag and buggered off to leave me to it, all alone but for the dog. Thence began 10 days of drifting between sleeping and waking states. I had a raging temperature and a cough like my late Aunt Vesna’s in Zagreb when she was smoking at least three packs a day. I woozily remembered her fondly while snatching bits of sleep between death rattles. I wouldn’t have got out of bed at all were it not for the needs of the dog, who, when requiring attention, would lick my face, or any other extremity poking out from beneath the sheets. He would lie around bored to tears until another round of vicious coughing started up, at which point he would slope off elsewhere. As I drifted back to sleep, I imagined him lying on the floor with his big paws over his ears, desolate with the tedium of it all. There were upsides to all this, though – for me if not for him. It was nice to be able to do nothing at all, for once, without having to feel bad about it. I picked up a couple of books that I’d had knocking around for years without ever opening. One was Metroland by Julian Barnes. The first chapter was so astoundingly good that it was almost exhausting to read. I wasn’t quite up to the challenge. So then I tried a book about the area I was languishing in – a place I’ve been coming to every year (every month, in fact) since I was a toddler – Gower in History by Paul Ferris. As early as the first paragraph, I knew I was blessed to be in the presence of a great writer. The Gower peninsula, he writes, “is about 14 miles long – depending on where you start measuring at the Swansea end – a rocky appendage, like something left over from a design that hasn’t quite worked”. Nicely put, sir. A more insightful, intelligent, moving and often funny history of anything I have yet to read. That it was about an area I love so well made it a still-greater joy. I came close to thanking Covid for the opportunity to discover the late author. “The unsettling thing about history,” Ferris writes, “is that we know what was going to happen to people next, and they did not. Our past was still their future.” An obvious enough point, I suppose, but I couldn’t get it out of my ibuprofen/paracetamol-addled mind. I’m always unsettled in country churchyards when I come across a grave of anyone who died in the early 1940s. Good God, they never knew that we won the war. A related thought was expressed – brilliantly, I thought – in a tweet by the BBC’s Fergal Keane in the early days of the unfolding horror in Ukraine. “We are into one of those periods in history whose course will seem blindingly obvious to future generations, but for us feels like the first steps into a dark forest filled with traps and malice.” Sweating away, half-awake with no one but a disappointed dog for company, I lay there quite oppressed by the fears of the millions of souls who have come before us, who didn’t know what to do – though it eventually became obvious – and never found out what was going to happen next. Eventually my dog could take no more and had to be exercised. A mate took him out and then after a week, once my red line had faded away, I worked up the energy to leave the house myself. As the former England manager Bobby Robson once said of his defender Terry Butcher, who had cut his head open but carried on playing, VCs have been won for less. It’s amazing how much more you notice when you’re having to walk very slowly. It was deeply mindful. And, mindful of the safety of other walkers, I was careful to stand a good way downwind of them as I told them how ill I was, eliciting great sympathy. Later, though I still felt rough, I risked a short drive to Penrice Castle, seat of one of Gower’s biggest landowners. Having been enthralled by their story in the book, I wanted to breathe their air. The castles – there’s a ruined one and one they live in – are in a private park but, doubtless to their irritation, a public footpath runs through it. Unleashed, the dog sprinted around, describing great arcs of joy. We came across a sign acknowledging only the most grudging acceptance of our right to be there. “Keep to the path.” Well, I was, even if my hound wasn’t. “Dogs must be kept on leads.” Oh dear. “No picnics.” None planned. “No cycling.” Ditto. “No running.” Eh? What happens if I break into a jog? Does a sniper take me out? And I’d have to run to catch the dog! This appalling catch-22 brought on another wave of fatigue. So we sloped off home back to bed.

3/24/2022,"Of the many inspirations that can be taken from the 2021 adaptation of West Side Story, one ought to be to start with a bang. So here’s an endorsement from Guillermo del Toro. “WSS is intoxicating, Heisenberg-level pure, uncut cinema.” For those who haven’t read the full thread from the director of Nightmare Alley on why his rival for best picture is so compelling, please do. Watching an artist genuinely rhapsodise about art is always worth the admission. But the central thrust of his argument, building out from a critique of a single scene, is this: Steven Spielberg’s film is a brilliant synthesis of the essential qualities of cinema and, as a result, is a reminder of what the art form can achieve. You could effectively rest your case there, but let’s indulge just a little longer. Indulgence, glory and spectacle being intrinsic to the movie after all – and those first moments a case in point. Adjusting to the screen, viewers may struggle to do anything more than let their eyes goggle as the camera rolls low across rubble, sweeps vertiginously to the vantage point of a crane, then dips to study the circumference of a wrecking ball before, aquí está, out pops a Jet from a trapdoor hidden in the dirt. There are umpteen other moments like it, but that’s the one that worked for me. It’s bold, it’s clever (not only does it end on a surprise, but the shot sets up the context of the story too) and after its grey, metallic start, it is suffused with bright light. That’s another thing that makes this movie a marvel: the light and the colour. While much of the movie was shot on location in New York, the city feels more like California, with the kind of rich and warming light that nurtures dreams (helped by a generous use of lens flare). When the Puerto Rican ensemble perform America and the light bounces off the colourful costumery – in particular the skirts – a carnival ensues. It’s difficult to think of a moment more joyous in recent cinema, and in a song that is centred on conflict. So there’s the film-making craft, and the sensory joy. Then there’s the performances, especially Ariana DeBose and Rita Moreno’s, and the punched-up choreography of Justin Peck that doesn’t imitate sex and violence but carries them within its every movement. There’s all that and lots more besides, without touching on the Bernstein/Sondheim genius that makes everything else possible. But to end on a serious note, as the film does, the final word must go to the way in which a story first told in 1957 makes itself feel contemporary in 2022. In its casting, West Side Story corrects a historic wrong that should never have been made in the first place. Its decision, however, not to use subtitles for the frequent (if snappy) Spanish dialogue is more welcome, progressive and wise, as it expands the experience for every English- as well as Spanish-speaking viewer. Those are the most direct ways in which West Side Story engages with the racial context of its story (one chilling scene involving Anita aside). Instead, the politics of the film are more about sex and class: the men seek to exert control over women, just as they are unable to exert any influence on the world around them. West Side Story does not seek to exonerate them for this behaviour but it does point to the systemic constraints – namely poverty – which perpetuate the pain. It feels like another good reason to boost the movie’s audience by giving it an award.",Arts/Film,Why West Side Story should win the best picture Oscar,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/24/why-west-side-story-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar
3/24/2022,"A high-powered cross-party UK delegation to India led by the Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, and his deputy has been called off at the last minute in a sign of a growing rift over India’s refusal to distance itself from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The 10-strong delegation has been in discussion with India since January and was planning to visit Delhi and Rajasthan, but the Indian high commission is understood to have raised objections at the last minute. Boris Johnson spoke with Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, on Tuesday in an attempt to use his influence to persuade India to take a more robust position over the Russian invasion. India has not imposed sanctions or even condemned Russia, its biggest supplier of military hardware. The Speaker’s visit, the first of its kind to India and part of his effort to act as a diplomat between parliaments, was due to go ahead during the Easter parliamentary recess. The delegation had originally been envisaged as giving a nudge to encourage progress on a UK-India free trade deal, but the context of the visit changed after the invasion of Ukraine in February, and Britain’s leading role in supporting the armed resistance of the Ukrainians. It was not clear if India’s issues were with individual members of the chosen delegation or related to a wider concern about British MPs being given a platform in India to urge Modi to take a more robust position. Britain has been concerned by reports that India’s central bank is in initial consultations on a rupee-rouble trade arrangement with Moscow that would enable exports to Russia to continue after western sanctions restricted international payment mechanisms. The talks would allow India to continue to buy Russian energy exports and other goods. However India, locked in a land border dispute with China, may feel it cannot afford to alienate its main arms supplier.",News/Politics,Rift over Ukraine exposed as high-powered UK delegation to India called off,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/24/rift-over-ukraine-exposed-as-high-powered-uk-delegation-to-india-called-off

3/24/2022,"At the Queens Museum, artist Christine Sun Kim’s newly completed mural features the words TIME OWES ME REST AGAIN, scrawled in black, spanning a crisp white wall, 40ft high and 100ft wide. The familiar action lines you would recognize from comic books set the words in motion: “TIME” hops along a pair of bouncing curves; “OWES” zips down to the floor with a splat!; and “REST” shoots upward into a pair of clouds. Poof poof! These comic references are a new development in her work, Kim tells me in American Sign Language, logged on to Zoom from her home in Berlin. (Her interpreter, Su Isakson, translates in a separate screen.) “They’re so dynamic in showing movement,” the artist adds; each bounce and zip represents how these words in ASL bring the hands in contact with the body. “TIME” is two taps on the wrist, she explains, and “OWES” is the index finger landing on the upward palm. “REST”, which is the arms crossed over the chest with closed fists, becomes a focal point in our conversation. In the mural, it describes both a collective fatigue under the burdens of capitalism (“It’s slowly killing us all,” Kim recently tweeted), as well as her own exhaustion navigating a world designed for the hearing. “As a deaf person,” she says, “you have to conserve your energy.” Time Owes Me Rest Again, on view through January 2023, is the kind of visual poetry innate to Kim’s practice, where for more than a decade, she’s played with the structures of language and notation to depict her relationship to sound. Born deaf in Orange county, California, to a family of hearing parents and a deaf older sister, she experienced sound by closely watching its effects on hearing people. Her art, which spans performance, video and naively styled drawings in charcoal and oil pastel, distills sound to its essential qualities – its moods and materialities, emotional frequencies and social baggage. “There’s a freshness to her work that represents a new kind of voice,” says Gan Uyeda, a director at Kim’s Los Angeles gallery, Francois Ghebaly. “She’s very much creating her own language.” Combined with the features of ASL, including rhythmic spacing and repetition, ordinary English text finds movement. In The Sound of Temperature Rising, for example, a 2019 mural about impending climate change, the title accompanies four musical notes that float upwards and multiply, illustrating a boiling crescendo. Facial expressions, “which represent grammar in ASL”, Kim says, also play a prominent role. In her 2016 video, Classified Digits, she plays out specific conversations – Skyping over spotty wifi, for example – solely through the awkwardness on her face, while the artist Thomas Mader, her husband and sometimes collaborator, acts them out with his hands as if they were hers. “Humor is such an important part of the work, and I see how she uses it very tactically,” Uyeda adds, describing how drawings like Shit Hearing People Say to Me and Degrees of Deaf Rage are serious grievances tempered by jokes. The former is a pie chart of misguided commentary that Kim’s heard over the years: “You’re smart for a deaf person” or “I’m sorry you can’t hear.” The latter, her breakout charcoal series from the 2019 Whitney Biennial, provides metrics for frustration on a scale of 1 to 360 degrees: museums with no deaf programming elicit a 360-degree circle of “Full on Rage”, while in-flight entertainment with no captions only elicits 180 degrees, a semi-circle of “Straight Up Rage”. Kim initially feared that the piece would make her look angry, but “humor brings a level of access, kind of like a meme,” she says. “If I were just mad without the humor, I think it might be uncomfortable and people would leave. They wouldn’t do the complex contemplative work that I want them to do.” The subtext of the artist’s fondness for laughter, data visualization and other universal modes of communication is a general wariness of being misrepresented and misunderstood; Kim knows intimately well how language barriers, as well as poor language choices, have the power to marginalize. Ahead of our interview, she sent me an access rider with links to resources about the deaf community, and a few gentle reminders – that ASL is not a “series of gestures”, and to please refrain from referring to her as a “deaf artist” or “an inspiration”. “I wanted to start off on the right foot,” she says, recalling the frustration of prior studio visits where “I’ve spent 45 minutes explaining deaf culture to curators and museum directors, leaving the last 15 minutes to talk about my work.” In response, Uyeda wrote out the rider to stem the tide of ableist language that would inevitably appear in media coverage and museum texts. “I felt like he was really watching my back,” Kim recalls. “It saved so much time and energy not having to do all this follow-up and explanation.” The artist finds her work in high demand these days, with works now in the collections of the Tate, the Museum of Modern Art, Lacma and more. Work on the scale of the Queens Museum has also become the norm; even in the midst of a pandemic, Kim was actively working on murals for institutions in Europe, Asia and North America. Her largest work to date was Captioning the City, a series of installations for the 2021 Manchester international festival. For about two and a half weeks, her texts graced the height of buildings and banners flown from airplanes: “[THE SOUND OF SEARCHING FOR SEATING]” read the main facade at Selfridges, with “[THE SOUND OF INTERMISSION THICKENING]” in the windows of the Royal Exchange. To make work at this scale is “amplifying the loudness of her expression”, says Hitomi Iwasaki, the director of exhibitions who commissioned Kim’s mural for the Queens Museum. “Visual art is all about maximizing communication, and expressing something beyond our system of language. To me, Christine’s work is like artistic expression 2.0.” For Kim, her work has created a vital and growing platform for the advocacy and visibility of the deaf community, occasionally in surprising ways. In 2020, she kicked off the year by signing the national anthem at the Super Bowl LIV, which she followed up with a New York Times op-ed. She criticized Fox Sports’ decision to only air a few seconds of her performance as a failure of accessibility, to a sea of positive responses. Still, she says, the term “political artist” feels too specific a label for her practice. “I want the privilege of being able to experiment, say, with butterflies and flowers,” she says. “But I do have a strong connection with political issues and social issues because it impacts my very basic human rights, and I can’t not talk about that in my work. “As an artist,” she adds, “I get to decide and assign meaning to ideas into things. There’s a lot of power in that.”",Arts/Art and design,‘She’s creating her own language’: Christine Sun Kim’s unique sound art,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/24/christine-sun-kim-unique-sound-art-queens-museum
3/24/2022,"Annastacia Palaszczuk has flagged tightening laws that govern political lobbying in Queensland, while acknowledging a “blurring” about how different roles and companies are treated under current regulation. At a press conference on Thursday, the state’s premier deflected questions as to whether her former staffer helped win a public contract months after she left Palaszczuk’s office. The Australian reported this week that Anacta Strategies, run by Labor-aligned figures Evan Moorhead and David Nelson, had won a contract, without tender, to provide training and advice to government-owned renewable energy corporation CleanCo. The contract is being managed by Palaszczuk’s former deputy chief of staff, Denise Spinks. Anacta provides both lobbying and consultancy services, and the company told the Australian that Spinks was hired as a consultant, not a lobbyist. CleanCo told the newspaper it did not employ Anacta “to engage or communicate with any party” on the company’s behalf. Palazczuk said she expected former government staffers to abide by post-separation protocols which ban business meetings with state officials on any matter related to their previous government duties for 18 months. The premier said she was advised that business was not discussed at a meeting that took place between Spinks, who started consulting to CleanCo in February after leaving government in September, and the renewable energy minister, Mick de Brenni. De Brenni confirmed to the Australian he had met with Spinks, but told the newspaper: “We discussed the importance of renewables and CleanCo and no lobbying activity took place.” Palaszczuk directed reporters to speak to the energy minister over claims that Anacta donated $35,000 to the party the day before the meeting, and questions about whether the pair did discuss CleanCo. Asked if it was appropriate for lobbyists to donate to political parties generally, the premier said that matter had been reviewed and recommended by former public servant Kevin Yearbury and was being investigated by a parliamentary committee. She also seemed to acknowledge Crime and Corruption Commission concerns that existing lobbying regulation does not capture in-house lobbying done by employees of larger companies, which are not subject to the same scrutiny as lobbying firms. “If we need to tighten rules, we will do so,” the premier said. “There is a blurring at the moment of people who are either in-house, working for in-house legal firms, for people who are government relations, and these are issues that will be looked at in the context of that review and the committee.” “We’ve got the strongest laws in the country, but if we can enhance those laws we always will.” Anacta’s Moorehead, a former state MP and Labor state secretary, helped to run the party’s election campaign in 2020. The firm has donated more than $160,000 to the Queensland Labor party since the start of 2020. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Anacta told the Australian it had previously recei­ved advice from the Queensland Integrity Commissioner confirming that consultancy services to state agencies did not constitute lobbying or business meetings. Nelson has previously said Anacta made “no apologies for being a Labor firm” and would continue to support the party within the rules. He said Anacta supported ongoing regulation of political donations and that all the company’s donations had been declared in accordance with the law. “Queensland has some of the strictest regulations in the country, with real-time disclosures and donation caps,” he said. “Should the laws be tightened further, we will continue to abide by them.” AJ Brown, a professor of public policy and law at Griffith University and a board member of Transparency International Australia, told Guardian Australia last week that donations from lobbyists should be banned outright. He said concerns stemmed from the fact a lobbyist’s core business is to promote the interests of third-party clients. “It defeats the purpose of donation transparency,” Brown said.",News/Australia news,Queensland premier admits ‘blurring’ of lobbying rules may require changes to the law,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/24/queensland-premier-admits-blurring-of-lobbying-rules-may-require-changes-to-the-law
3/24/2022,"Good morning to you. Warren Murray with the stories at the top of Thursday’s agenda. Today marks one month since the start of the Russian war against Ukraine. Shaun Walker writes that much still hangs in the balance: “The initial Russian plan, it seems, was for a slightly bloodier version of its 2014 Crimea annexation, with pockets of resistance mopped up and a Russian puppet regime taking control. The plan, which could only have been based on shockingly flawed intelligence about the mood in Ukraine and the state of its army, was quickly shown to be hopeless. … Even in the few cities where the Russians have established control bloodlessly, their forces face angry crowds and have had few successes in co-opting local politicians. The lack of success has led to a grimmer phase of the war … Russia showed itself willing to submit Mariupol, Kharkiv and other Russian-speaking cities to ruthless artillery and air bombardment.” Today, world leaders are to hold a series of emergency summits in Europe that aim to ratchet up pressure on the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to end the war. In Brussels, Joe Biden will take part in back-to-back Nato, G7 and European Union summits that will bring pledges of more lethal weapons for Ukraine, more punishing sanctions on Russia and warnings about further escalation. In its latest update, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Ukraine had increased pressure on Russian forces north-east of Kyiv, while carrying out successful counterattacks against Russian positions in towns on the outskirts of the capital. The MoD noted there is a “realistic possibility” that Ukrainian forces will be able to encircle Russian units in Bucha and Irpin. The Kyiv mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said that “the small city of Makariv and almost all of Irpin is already under the control of Ukrainian soldiers”. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called for citizens worldwide to take to the streets “in the name of peace” and hold global protests against Russia’s bloody war. Zelenskiy said Ukraine was “waiting for meaningful steps” from the Nato, EU and European Council meetings today, and listed some so far unheeded requests, such as a no-fly zone, aircraft and tanks. “At these three summits we will see: who is a friend, who is a partner, and who betrayed us for money.” Zelenskiy, who will speak to Nato members by video on Thursday, said he is asking the alliance to provide “effective and unrestricted” support to Ukraine, including any weapons the country needs to fend off the Russian invasion. Nato has announced it will double its troops along the alliance’s eastern flank, beginning the deployment of four new battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia. The UK will double the number of missiles it sends to Ukraine and is urging western allies to step up provision of lethal aid. Help for those better off – Britain’s most vulnerable households will face the full force of the biggest squeeze on living standards on record after Rishi Sunak targeted better-off workers for help in his £9bn mini-budget package of tax and duty cuts. There will be a 5p cut in fuel duty and a £3,000 increase in the national insurance contributions threshold, but the chancellor failed to shield pensioners and those dependent on state benefits from the cost-of-living crisis. Sunak announced a 1p cut in income tax to 19p, coming into force in April 2024, just ahead of the anticipated general election. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said the spring statement had given back only a sixth of the tax increases announced by Sunak during his two years as chancellor and that even after these measures, living standards would fall by more than 2% this year – the steepest drop since records began in the 1950s. Use our tool to work out how you fare. It comes as some vulnerable people using food banks decline items such as potatoes because they cannot afford the energy to boil them, according to the boss of the supermarket Iceland. Meanwhile there has been a chorus of criticism from businesses and lobby groups who said Sunak had done little to alleviate cost inflation steeper than anything faced by British businesses since the 1990s. ‘Putin is small and pale’ – Madeleine Albright, who came to the US as a refugee and made history as the first woman to be secretary of state, has died aged 84 from cancer. Joe Biden saluted Albright as “a force for goodness, grace, and decency – and for freedom … Hers were the hands that turned the tide of history.” Bill Clinton, the president Albright served, paid tribute to “one of the finest secretaries of state, an outstanding UN ambassador, a brilliant professor and an extraordinary human being”. Recently as Vladimir Putin amassed Russian forces on the border with Ukraine, Albright wrote in the New York Times of meeting him in Moscow in 2000. “Flying home,” she wrote, “I recorded my impressions. ‘Putin is small and pale,’ I wrote, ‘so cold as to be almost reptilian.’ He claimed to understand why the Berlin Wall had to fall but had not expected the whole Soviet Union to collapse. ‘Putin is embarrassed by what happened to his country and determined to restore its greatness.’” US-UK trade deal far off – A bilateral trade deal between the US and the UK is “desirable” but will not progress while the Northern Ireland peace deal is used for domestic political purposes, the American congressmen Richard Neal has warned. The chairman of the House ways and means committee told the Guardian: “We will not entertain a trade agreement if there is any jeopardy to the Good Friday agreement.” Neal is a key figure in US trade deals and negotiated the US-Mexico-Canada agreement. His committee writes trade bills and without its support a deal will not be approved. The US trade representative Katherine Tai has dashed hopes of any imminent post-Brexit free-trade deal, saying it was not worth spending “years and a lot of blood, sweat and tears” over. ‘We had no role to play’ – Two of the five officers involved in the traumatic strip search of a 15-year-old black girl at her Hackney school have been removed from frontline duties, the Metropolitan police has confirmed. At an online community meeting, Hackney’s Basic Unit commander, Marcus Barnett, said the Met had a problem with officers viewing inner London children as “adults”, and what happened to Child Q would probably not have happened in the Cotswolds. Officers were called due to a teacher wrongly suspecting that she had cannabis. Barnett said the school “probably should not have called us and we should probably have understood very quickly that we had no role to play there”. Chanel Dolcy, a solicitor for the family, said Child Q had launched civil proceedings against the force and her school. Small orchards in peril – There are 80% fewer small “traditional” orchards, regarded as important for flora and fauna, in England and Wales compared with in 1900. Traditional orchards are defined as sites with at least five trees managed in a low-intensity way, the floor grazed or mowed with little or no chemical input. As well as those lost in the regions, the National Trust says the expansion of cities and towns has cost them most of their orchards, with London having only 3% left. Kent has the highest total coverage but only because of large commercial orchards. John Deakin from the trust said: “Traditional orchards and the blossom they bring create valuable early nectar sources for insects which are often foraging for scarce resources in the early spring.” The trust has committed to planting 4m blossom trees in England, Wales and Northern Ireland by 2030 and to set up more traditional orchards on its land. There is a scheme to bring more orchard trees into Birmingham, once known as a city “ringed with blossom”. For weeks the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol has been under constant bombardment from Russian artillery. With the city in ruins, residents who risked everything to escape can now tell their stories.

But today she fears the whole field – and justice itself – is at risk. England captain Joe Root is hoping to secure a morale-boosting series win in the final Test against West Indies to put “a very difficult winter” behind the team. In the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup, England have progressed after beating Pakistan with 30 overs to spare. Lotte Wubben-Moy scored late on to rescue a 1-1 draw for Arsenal Women at home to Wolfsburg in their Champions League quarter-final first leg. In the Women’s Super League, Manchester City moved level on points with third-placed Manchester United after repeating their FA Cup win over Everton. Ash Barty’s decision to retire on Wednesday at the age of just 25, as the No 1 player in the world and during such a beautiful moment in her career, is a shock on the surface, but the manner of her departure fits perfectly with the way she has conducted her career, writes Tumaini Carayol. Steve Clarke has admitted to serious doubts that Scotland’s World Cup play-off semi-final against Ukraine will take place on its rescheduled early June date. Chelsea have had the terms of the licence imposed by the government after the sanctioning of Roman Abramovich eased further, with the club now allowed to sell tickets to fans for away fixtures. Russia has been warned off bidding to host the men’s European Championship in 2028 after it submitted an unexpected declaration of interest in staging the tournament. And Owen Farrell is primed to make his rugby return on Saturday for Saracens after a four-month absence. The cost of living squeeze highlighted in the spring statement was underlined by inflation figures yesterday showing that prices rose 6.2% last month, driven by the rising cost of petrol and diesel and a wide range of goods from food to toys and games. Fuel prices could rise even higher as well after Vladimir Putin said Russia would demand payment for gas and oil in roubles. The news pushed British gas prices up 11% yesterday although Brent crude has dropped a little today to $121.01. The FTSE100 is tracking to lift 0.3% this morning while the pound is $1.318 and €1.200. Rishi Sunak’s attempt to cast himself as a tax-cutting chancellor despite Britain facing the biggest drop in living standards since the 1950s is met with scorn on the front of many of Thursday’s papers. The normally pro-Tory government Express says “The forgotten millions say: what about us?” as it reports millions of Britons have been “left without a helping hand” by Sunak’s mini-budget. The Guardian’s lead is “Cost of living surges: and Sunak squeezes poorest”, saying that better-off workers will benefit most from the chancellor’s cut in petrol duty while Sunak ignored the case for help to cut energy bills to help poorer households. The Telegraph’s front page says “‘The biggest fall in living standards on record’” and reports on the unease of many Tory MPs at Sunak’s failure to take their advice and scrap the national insurance increases. The Mail has a different spin on the Tory reaction with the headline “Now slash taxes even further”. The FT makes more of the fact that by proceeding with the NI rise in the face of backbench opposition, Sunak is trying to give himself room to cut income taxes before the next general election. “Sunak banks windfall for pre-election tax cut as cost of living crisis hits home”. The Mirror goes with “Thanks for nothing”, saying there was “nothing for energy bills, nothing for pensioners, and nothing to stop worst fall in living standards since the 50s”. Inside it lists 13 cost of living blows that Sunak has not addressed, from energy bills to mortgage rates. The Times has “Biggest fall in living standards since 1950s”, while the i says much the same: “Biggest hit to living standards since age of rationing”. The Metro says “No heat to eat”, and reaches even further back into history to report that the tax burden is the highest it’s been since the 1940s. The reaction of regional titles is much more pointed with the Northern Echo asking “Is that it?”. “Sunak told he must do more for millions facing poverty” says the Yorkshire Post. The Herald in Scotland has a more upbeat line however, reporting “Sunak pledges tax break to two million Scots workers”.

3/24/2022,"At 2.54pm on the second day of Ketanji Brown Jackson’s confirmation hearings that will determine whether she takes a seat on the US supreme court, the solemn proceedings took a nosedive into farce. Ted Cruz, the Republican senator from Texas, turned theatrically to an outsized blow-up of a children’s book, Antiracist Baby by Ibram X Kendi. Pointing to a cartoon from its pages of an infant in diapers taking their first walk, he asked Jackson: “Do you agree with this book… that babies are racist?” “Senator,” Jackson began with a sigh. And then she paused for seven full seconds, which in the august setting of the Senate judiciary committee hearing felt like a year. For the one and only time in the 13 hours of questioning that Jackson endured that day, the nominee appeared flummoxed. Or was it flabbergasted? Here she was, aged 51, with almost a decade’s experience as a federal judge behind her and, if confirmed, the history-making distinction of becoming the first Black woman to sit on the nation’s highest court ahead of her. And she was being asked whether babies were racist? “I don’t believe that any child should be made to feel as though they are racist or not valued, or less than, that they are victims, oppressors,” she said eventually. When Cruz refused to drop the subject she gave a more direct answer. “I have not reviewed any of those books,” she said. “They don’t come up in my work as a judge, which I’m respectfully here to address.” That Cruz chose to focus on critical race theory (CRT), the years-old academic theory that has become the latest conservative hot-button issue, in his questioning spoke volumes about the brutal social issue politics of today’s Republican party. That he did so to a Black woman lent the exchange the astringency of a racial dog-whistle. Cruz’s attack was not unique. Four hours before he began his interrogation, the official Twitter account of the Republican National Committee posted a gif of the nominee bearing her initials “KBJ” which are then scratched out and replaced with the letters: “CRT”. Critical race theory is an academic discipline that examines the ways in which racism operates in US laws and society. There was another twist to Cruz’s questioning. The private elementary school at which he claimed CRT was being taught – Antiracist Baby and all – is Georgetown Day School on whose board Jackson sits as a trustee. When GDS was founded in 1945 it too made history as the first integrated school, serving both Black and white children, in the nation’s capital. Lest any of the attendants of the hearings inside the Hart Senate office building or following along on television had doubts about Cruz’s motivations, he grilled Jackson on several other racially-charged subjects. He began by vaunting his own anti-racist credentials by expressing the admiration he shared with Jackson for Martin Luther King. Within seconds of that warm embrace, however, the senator segued to a speech that Jackson made in 2020 – on MLK day – in which she referred to the 1619 Project. The project, initiated by the New York Times, seeks to reframe American history by placing the consequences of slavery and the role of African American women front and centre of the national narrative. Cruz asked Jackson if she agreed with some of its more contested conclusions, which he claimed were “deeply inaccurate and misleading”, to which she replied that she had only mentioned it because it was “well known to the students I was talking to”. Again, she stressed, this was a subject that had absolutely nothing to do with her work – or by implication, the job of a supreme court justice. Outside observers were incensed by Cruz’s tactics. “What we saw today was an attempt to assail the character of Ketanji Brown Jackson, because her record is so wholly unassailable,” Janai Nelson, president and director-counsel of the racial justice organization, NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said on MSNBC. Raphael Warnock, the Democratic senator from Georgia and former senior pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist church in Atlanta where King once preached, pondered in the New York Times: “Would they be asking these questions if this were not a Black woman?” There were other awkward moments in Jackson’s epic inquisition, which she survived while barely dropping the perma-smile from her face. There was the moment that Lindsey Graham, Republican senator from South Carolina, flounced out of the hearing having earlier wrongly accused Jackson of having called George W Bush and the then defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld “war criminals”. Yet more bizarre was the episode when Marsha Blackburn, Republican senator from Tennessee, asked Jackson whether she could “provide a definition for the word ‘woman’.” “No, I can’t,” came the curt reply. It was all a far cry from the promise delivered by Senator Chuck Grassley, the top Republican in the judiciary committee, at the start of the hearings. There would be no “spectacle” or “political circus” coming from his side of the aisle. Several Republican senators followed that pledge by channelling QAnon. Senators Josh Hawley from Missouri, Cruz and Graham all pursued the inquisitorial line that Jackson had been unduly lenient as a federal district court judge in her sentencing of sex offenders who consume and distribute images of child sex abuse. Though they avoided stating so explicitly, the senators clearly intended to imply that Jackson’s sympathies lay with pedophiles. That’s a short stone’s throw away from the core conspiracy theory peddled by QAnon, the toxic Donald Trump-supporting online movement. At its “Pizzagate” inception during the 2016 presidential campaign, QAnon fantasised about a child trafficking ring around Hillary Clinton and other Democratic leaders and liberal Hollywood celebrities. As Media Matters has noted, the claim that Jackson was lenient towards sex offenders consuming images of children first surfaced last month. A conservative group American Accountability Foundation (AAF) ran an “investigation” into her writings while a student at Harvard law school in which she explored discrepancies in sentencing policy in such cases. The group misleadingly claimed that her writing exposed her as a radical judicial activist dedicated to “social justice engineering”. Days before the confirmation hearings began, Republican senators had taken up AAF’s lead and were plotting how to use it during the confirmation process. Last week Politico obtained a document that was circulating among the senators in which they rehearsed the claim that the judge “routinely handed out light sentence”, and that the lightest of all were in “child pornography cases”. A pedophile-sympathising, critical race theory-loving, judicial activist, radical leftist social engineer. The vision of the nominee that was presented over hours of Republican grilling made for quite the spectacle. But will the political circus work? “They are trying to find some way to make her look less than qualified,” Nelson concluded. “They failed miserably.”",News/US news,Republicans turn Ketanji Brown Jackson hearing into a political circus ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/24/ketanji-brown-jackson-republicans-senate-confirmation-hearing
