5/7/2022,"A cabinet minister has urged Tory MPs not to act against Boris Johnson after the party’s bruising local election results, as a critic of the prime minister said questions over his leadership “had to be brought to a head”. After the Conservatives lost almost 500 seats and the control of 11 councils, the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, called on Saturday for party unity, arguing that Johnson remained a vote winner. He told Sky News: “He is an asset, absolutely … if you look at the way that Boris cuts through in places like Nuneaton, places like Newcastle-under-Lyme, other parts of the country as well – Harrow in London.” Zahawi added: “People don’t like to vote for split parties, for teams that are divided. “We are stronger when we are united and that would be my message to all my colleagues.” When asked if he believed the prime minister was a “man of integrity” on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Zahawi said Johnson was “not just a man of integrity, but a man who works all hours to deliver for the nation”. In significant local election blows to the Conservatives, Labour took Tory London flagship councils in Westminster, Wandsworth and Barnet. The party also recorded its worst position in Scotland for a decade and lost control of its only council in Wales, Monmouthshire, to Labour. The results have reignited criticism in some quarters of Johnson’s leadership, with rumblings that his premiership could be under threat. Some Conservatives voiced frustration that activities at No 10 had pushed ardent supporters to either “sit on their hands” or vote against the party, with Partygate regularly brought up on doorsteps. There was renewed criticism on Saturday from a Tory backbench critic of the prime minister, Aaron Bell, who said discussions were needed regarding the future leadership of the Conservative party. Bell, who has already submitted a letter of no confidence in Johnson, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that about one in six “traditional Tory voters” he encountered while canvassing “had a real issue” with Partygate. “There were some people who said they were going to sit on their hands and stay at home and probably some people even who voted against us. So that’s obviously something we’ve got to address, something we’ve got to win back.” Fifty-four letters have to be sent to the chair of the backbench 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady, for a vote of no confidence to be called. Bell added: “My position in terms of putting my letter to Sir Graham Brady hasn’t changed. It’s not really up to me, it’s up to my colleagues and I’m sure when we get back to Westminster, there will be a discussion about that. “What I do think is it needs to be brought to a head sooner rather than later because I don’t think we can continue having this hanging over the party for many more months to come, with the Metropolitan police and Sue Gray and then the Privileges Committee.” John Mallinson, the Conservative leader of Carlisle city council, told the BBC he had “lost some very good colleagues” in the Cumberland local election, adding he had found it “difficult to drag the debate back to local issues” while campaigning, because of Partygate and the cost of living crisis. He said Johnson would be a “poor option” to lead the Conservatives into the next general election.",News/Politics,Minister urges Tory MPs not to act against Boris Johnson after election results,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/07/minister-urges-tory-mps-not-to-act-against-boris-johnson-after-election-results
5/7/2022,"Emmanuel Macron said that his reelection marked a “fundamental democratic renaissance” as he was sworn in for a second term of office as president of France at a ceremony at the Elysée Palace. Macron, who defeated his far right rival, Marine Le Pen, in the second round vote two weeks ago, entered on Saturday to the strains of Handel played by the Garde Républicaine’s string quartet and listened as the official results were read. “From the return of war to Europe to the pandemic and the ecological emergency, rarely has our country been faced with such a combination of challenges. The French people have chosen a clear and explicit project for the future, a European project of independence, scientific, social and ecological progress,” he told the 500 guests in a relatively brief acceptance speech, “It’s at the most difficult times that France shows the best of itself. At this moment when the century is changing, we have to map out a path and show a way forward together,” he said. “Let us have the courage to look reality in the face. Let us be faithful to the values of freedom, equality, fraternity and secularism. Let us continue to love the Republic and all that it entails. Let us love our homeland.” He insisted his second five-year term would not be a simple continuation of the first mandate but would be a “new method”. He pledged “to act” to create a “more inclusive” education system, and “a health service accessible everywhere” as well as greater sexual equality and a stronger military. “I have one aim and that is to serve, to serve our country … to serve my compatriots with a sense of duty … to serve our children and youngsters,” he said. Afterwards he shook hands with many of the guests who included former presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and François Hollande as well as current members of his cabinet all facing a reshuffle in the coming days. He then walked to the Elysée gardens to honour the Tricolor while the Marseillaise was played followed by a 21-gun salute fired from Les Invalides military complex. Macron, 44, who won the election on 24 April with a score of 58.55% against Le Pen, is now expected to name a new prime minister to replace Jean Castex as well as other ministers. Gabriel Attal, the government spokesperson, told France 2 the government would not change before Macron’s second mandate officially begins on 13 May. Saturday’s ceremony came after a week which saw the Parti Socialiste along with the Greens/Ecologists and Communists form an historic alliance for next month’s two-round parliamentary elections under the leadership of the radical left leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon, of La France Insoumise (France Unbowed), who came a close third in the presidential election. Various centrist and centre-right factions have rallied to Macron under the slogan Ensemble (Together); the president has changed the name of his La République en Marche (Republic on the Move) party - formed to sweep him to power five years ago - to Renaissance. Macron now faces a battle to retain control of the French parliament in what will be his final five years in power.",News/World news,Macron hails ‘democratic renaissance’ as he is sworn in for second term,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/07/french-president-macron-renaissance-elysee-palace-ceremony
5/7/2022,"A speech by the home secretary, Priti Patel, was disrupted on Friday evening after pro-refugee activists infiltrated a Conservative party “spring dinner”. Eight young social justice and climate campaigners from Green New Deal Rising disrupted the Bassetlaw Conservative Association Spring Dinner and demanded she drop controversial plans to offshore asylum seekers to Rwanda. As Patel started to address the party faithful, activists stood up, one by one, to condemn the offshoring plans and called on Patel to abandon them. “As young people wanting to live in a fair and compassionate society, we are disgusted by your treatment of refugees,” said one of the activists, as plain-clothed security personnel appeared swiftly and removed the protesters from the building. Attendees at the Conservative dinner could be heard on video footage of the incident chanting: “Out, out, out”. The group targets politicians and other establishment figures and disrupts meetings they attend to challenge their stance on social justice and climate change issues. This tactic is becoming increasingly popular among activists. Extinction Rebellion recently disrupted HSBC’s AGM singing a variation of Abba’s Money, Money, Money, changing the words to “money, money, money, it’s so scummy, in HSBC’s world”. Hannah Martin, from Green New Deal Rising, said: “The plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda is inhumane and will lead to the destruction of people’s lives and further harm those people who are seeking safety.” “Those who stand for climate justice also stand against Priti Patel’s cruel plans that demonise people who are escaping terrifying situations as they bear the brunt of the multiple crises of war, poverty and the climate catastrophe. We want Priti Patel to drop the dangerous Rwanda migration plan and provide support and safety for migrants, refugees and people seeking asylum.” The plans to offshore asylum seekers to Rwanda were announced on 14 April and are the subject of several legal challenges. Initially the government suggested that the first removals would take place very soon but the prime minister, Boris Johnson, has now indicated it is likely to be several months before anyone is forcibly removed to the African country. Many asylum seekers have reported being terrified of being sent to Rwanda. Bassetlaw Conservatives and the Home Office have been approached for comment.",News/UK news,Activists disrupt Priti Patel speech in protest against Rwanda refugee plan,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/07/social-justice-activists-disrupt-priti-patel-speech-to-protest-rwanda-refugee-plan
5/7/2022,"The climate hunger striker who starved himself for more than five weeks outside parliament has said he did not expect ministers would ignore his demands and potentially let him die. Angus Rose had said he would not eat until Greg Hands, the energy minister, arranged for Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientist, to give politicians and, via broadcast, the public, the climate change briefing he gave to Boris Johnson before the Cop26 climate summit. After 37 days, as fears grew of long-term harm or even sudden death, and with no sign of a concession from ministers, he relented after Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, arranged a briefing for MPs through the all-party parliamentary group on climate change. Rose had originally asked for Vallance to do a televised briefing of cabinet rather than address a parliament committee, but said he was happy with the outcome. By the end of his strike, he had lost 17kg and was having difficulty standing, but still protested outside parliament every day. “Before I started the hunger strike, I thought my odds were, no, they wouldn’t let me die,” Rose said. “But … in spite of the warnings being that I had lost a significant percentage of my body weight, that left me in a very high-risk category. “People in a state of starvation who lose more than 16% of the body mass encounter rapidly deteriorating health … and that’s what some health experts were saying: that I was at very high risk.” Hands met Rose during his hunger strike and the two corresponded. Rose previously told the Guardian that Hands insisted he could not meet his demand, and had urged him several times to reconsider his protest. Government sources told the Guardian at the time that ministers felt they could not give in to Rose’s demand, since to do so would encourage others to take similarly risky actions. Meanwhile, Rose’s supporters feared he could suffer sudden heart failure after starving himself for so long. “It’s an interesting question,” Rose said. “Would they have? Would they have left me there for another week to see what happened? I don’t know.” Rose accepted the outcome of his strike was a compromise, but said it was a similar compromise to that accepted by Guillermo Fernandez, the Swiss hunger striker from whom he had taken inspiration. “He was pressurising the environment minister, all of the pressure was put on her head,” Rose said. “And in my case, all of my pressure was put on Greg Hands. And in both cases, they didn’t agree to the demand, and in both cases there was an alternate solution. “My goal was to get the briefing by whatever means, although the way I saw it up until it was secured, I wasn’t going to back down until Greg agreed to the demand. “Over the 37 days there was only less than half an hour when I sat back and contemplated and reflected on the enormity of the situation ahead of me, and that wasn’t fun. “The way I tried to handle that was just on a day-to-day basis, and over the last 10 days or so, in particular, I got quite a bit weaker, and it started impacting my thinking, my memory. But I was still just doing one day at a time, and I wasn’t going to stop until my demand was met. “Yes, it is, I suppose, a bit of a compromise. But I couldn’t say no to the briefing [that] has been secured.” Rose said he felt the “vast majority” of the public he met in his five weeks standing outside parliament supported his aims. He also had a team of about 40 people supporting him, lobbying press and politicians, and orchestrating letters from scientists and medics backing his demand. Towards the end, many were encouraging him to back down. But not all. “I had a friend who was prepared to bring me from hospital in a wheelchair back to be in front of the houses of parliament if I collapsed,” Rose said. “And I was like, wow, I really didn’t expect that. I didn’t expect [that] because it’s so extreme, you know? Who would have been prepared to do that?” Rose is part of a growing wave of climate hunger strikers. As well as Fernandez, last year a group of youths staged a shorter hunger strike outside the White House in the US; in the UK, climate activist Emma Smart refused food when she was jailed for protesting with Insulate Britain; Rose himself joined climate hunger strikers in 2019 in the aftermath of Extinction Rebellion’s protests. Rose said the growing numbers of climate hunger strikers, and the self-immolation of Wynn Bruce in Washington last month, were part of a “rising tide” of increasingly desperate activism. “People will be taking increasingly desperate measures because the government’s actions and its policies aren’t consistent with maintaining a habitable planet on which to live,” Rose said.“This country is currently aiming for world that is two and a half to three degrees warmer. Forget about one and a half. Forget about two. The current policies and actions will see us looking at a world that’s two and a half to three degrees warmer. “So yeah, there these are desperate actions, but they are consistent with the risks.”",News/Environment,Climate hunger striker expresses shock at being ignored by ministers ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/07/climate-hunger-striker-parliament-angus-rose
5/7/2022," Top playing, a first-class recording, handsomely produced: the Polish composer Mieczysław Weinberg (1919-96) is at last being given his due, as a new disc proves beyond doubt. It features his works for cello and orchestra performed by Pieter Wispelwey (cello), Jean-Michel Charlier (clarinet) with Les Métamorphoses conducted by Raphaël Feye (Evil Penguin Classic). The Cello Concertino (1948), melancholy, songlike, lightly scored, is immediately compelling. Found only recently, it shares material with the later Cello Concerto. Wispelwey plays with supple energy, keeping emotion in check in the lament at start and finish, the double-stopped chords clean and precise, the pizzicato warm and fluid. The Fantasy, a single movement with several sections, has folk-inspired, nostalgic charm. The Chamber Symphony No 4, Op 153, for string orchestra and clarinet, with a memorable Allegro full of klezmer-inspired punch, was the prolific composer’s last completed work. As a companion piece listen, too, to the Arcadia Quartet’s new album, Weinberg: String Quartets Vol 2, Nos 1, 7 and 11 (Chandos).  When a composer leaves more than one version of a work – Bruckner symphonies, famously – specialists may spend lifetimes poring over differences and debating final intentions. The innocent listener can be left worrying which is the “right” account. The answer, emphatically, is: whichever you prefer. In the case of Janáček’s Glagolitic Mass, with origins dating back 20 years before the work appeared, the genesis is particularly complicated. The Czech Philharmonic Choir of Brno, Orchestra philharmonique de Strasbourg, conductor Marko Letonja and soloists Malin Byström, Jennifer Johnston, Ladislav Elgr and Adam Plachetka (Warner Classics) have recorded the “September 1927” version. The many detailed differences, especially relating to later cuts, and use of organ and timpani, are laid out in the liner notes. The climactic passage in the Svet (Sanctus) here has an almost unbearable tension, the high-lying vocal parts – for soloists and chorus alike – excellently and urgently handled. The effect of the organ solo before the final Intrada is spine-tingling. Any Janáček fan will want to hear this version, together with the disc’s other work, the ever-thrilling Sinfonietta.

5/7/2022,"TV and radio presenter Alice Levine, producer James Cooper and director Jamie Morton are the creators of My Dad Wrote a Porno, the blockbuster comedy podcast boasting more than 300m downloads. Centred on readings of (and reactions to) Belinda Blinked – surreal erotic literature written and self-published by “Rocky Flintstone”, AKA Morton’s father – the show has amassed a cult following and celebrity fans including Elijah Wood. It is now in its sixth season and the trio are the guest curators for The Podcast Show 2022 Live from 23 to 29 May, and are touring until June. Jamie, James and I met at the University of Leeds. I’d say this was taken “on set” of our student television studio, but that’s giving it too much glamour. We were based in the caretaker’s office under the stairs. That kind of pixie crop suits 5% of face shapes, so the hair was a rogue move for my first year. Particularly when you’re mainly subsisting on jacket potatoes and cheesy chips, I didn’t really have the gamine bone structure to pull it off. I think that’s Craig David we were pointing at; one of the stalwarts of the time. We became friends while making episodes of LSTV (Leeds Student Television), a magazine show that James and I hosted, and Jamie filmed. The show went out online, as well as broadcasting in the union and the communal hallway. Like any good show, we were primarily playing on mute as people walked from room to room. Nobody watched it, but we were geeks who liked making stuff. It felt like a little secret society. My first impression of James was he was funny and seemed so mature. This is still true. Jamie seemed so skilled and competent, and was making actual films and TV. I was very impressed by them both. After uni we stuck together: ridiculously, we all managed to get the same internship for a TV company that made shows like Wife Swap. We couldn’t afford to live in London but my parents knew a woman who had a house in Surrey, so we stayed there while she was away. There was one caveat: she had a sick cat and we had to give it a pill every morning. James would crowbar its mouth open and I’d massage the pill down its throat. I was like: we are living the London dream! It’s just like Sex and the City! It was Christmastime in a cosy pub in 2015 when Jamie first brought the chapters of Belinda Blinked to read to us. The more he read, the more hysterical we got. By the end we were so obnoxiously loud that we had cleared the pub. At one point he got a bit cross, saying: “You can’t keep interrupting or we’ll never get through it!” I feel like that moment formed the basis of the whole show. While our preferred currency is to make each other laugh and to take the piss out of each other relentlessly, there’s a lot of love and support, too. We’ve lived through some huge moments together – bad breakups and people dying. Even though we’re running a business together and the stakes of our friendship have been raised, somehow it still feels like we’re doing student TV; like it’s our own secret little thing. I’m guessing we were doing something on indie music that day: it looks like in order to get into the spirit I put on a leather jacket and a jumper with five VW campervans on it. The hair is crap, too. It’s a look. That period was very formative for me. I was in charge of this entertainment programme and needed a female host. I’d met Alice on a bus and thought she was really funny, so asked her to do it. We clicked and became this presenting double act. The tone we were attempting was Simon and Miquita-era Popworld, but I think we missed the mark. Then I met Jamie at a Halloween party – he was really smart and quite acerbic. People were in awe of him, so naturally I was jealous. But quickly we became friends. The three of us would go out together most nights: I was drinking a lot of snakebite and black, and Jamie would be on two litres of this really cheap cider called White Ace. Jamie and I lived together when I moved to London and that’s when I first properly met Rocky. From the first moment Jamie read his writing to me, it felt like nothing I’d ever experienced. There are times I’ve nearly died laughing at Rocky’s words. Early on we realised the podcast was getting an immediate audience. It was a shock for Jamie, but we told him we could stop whenever he wanted to. Even now, we only do one every year, because he needs a breather where his dad is just his dad and not Rocky. You see old friends who’ve formed creative endeavours but eventually crumble. It’s smug, but I’m proud we’ve managed our relationship so maturely and respectfully. It’s what keeps us together – our love and deep roots. That hair – it was mad. I cut it off when I moved to London, scared I wouldn’t get a job with it looking so studenty. When Dad retired, he was worried about being bored. I told him he should do something to pass the time. So he decided to write a book: great in principle until I realised it was pornography. He’s a bit of a wind-up merchant and sent me the first few chapters, probably to shock me. I thought it was horrific but the funniest thing I’d read in my entire life. When Porno first came out, podcasts weren’t too popular so I wasn’t expecting much. Then it went to No 1 in the charts and I started to worry people would think I hated my dad or was doing it against his will, even though I knew he thought it was hilarious. I also found it tough making the transition from background to the front [Jamie narrates chapters of the book each episode]. I remember being in tears, telling Alice and James that I couldn’t do it any more. They were so brilliant and reassured me, saying: “This is just fun. But if you’re not comfortable, then we will stop.” That kindness was part of our relationship. Walking out on stage to a sold-out Royal Albert Hall was a total highlight of our friendship. Backstage, Emma Thompson knocked on the door to say: “Guys, I’m so excited, good luck!” But most of all I love it when the three of us are hanging out in one of our flats and Alice is cooking an amazing dinner, and we are chatting and listening to music. Those are the best moments. When that photo was taken we were so green. It was the start of everything and we had so many ambitions. Being where we are now, and not only having achieved so much but having achieved it together, is lovely.",Lifestyle/Life and style,The My Dad Wrote a Porno podcasters look back: ‘I wasn’t doing it against Dad’s will.

5/7/2022,"Sinn Féin was celebrating a historic victory in the Stormont assembly election on Saturday despite warnings from the Democratic Unionist party that it would block the formation of a new power-sharing executive until the Northern Ireland protocol was changed. As counting resumed ahead of the allocation of final seats, it was clear that Sinn Féin, with 29% first preference votes, had overtaken the DUP, which won 21.3%. It meant the all-Ireland republican party would be entitled to nominate its deputy leader, Michelle O’Neill, as the Northern Ireland’s first nationalist first minister. The scale of the party’s victory left unionists at some count centres visibly stunned and prompted jubilation among supporters of Sinn Féin, whose leader, Mary Lou McDonald, told TalkTV she believed a border poll on a united Ireland would be “possible within a five-year timeframe”. The other big winner in Thursday’s election was the centrist Alliance, which surged to 13.5%, putting it in third place and showing the growing clout of a third bloc that eschews nationalist and unionist labels. Under power-sharing rules Sinn Féin, the DUP and Alliance, and possibly other parties that may clear a threshold, are supposed to form a new executive on 12 May. However the DUP leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, said he would refuse to join a new administration until the UK government “dealt with” the protocol, the post-Brexit deal that puts a trade border in the Irish Sea. That would paralyse Stormont, which would be run by a caretaker administration, and put pressure on the prime minister, Boris Johnson, to amend the protocol to end the stalemate. All sides expect the impasse to last weeks, possibly months, possibly culminating in a new election. Donaldson has avoided saying whether he would serve as a deputy first minister if Sinn Féin held the first minister post. The posts have equal power but the prospect of O’Neill holding the more prestigious title is anathema to many unionists. However, Gregory Campbell, a DUP MP, told RTE on Saturday the protocol was the only obstacle to reviving Stormont and signalled that the party could accept O’Neill as first minister. “The people have spoken.” Voters ranked the cost of living and health service as their chief concerns, but the campaign was dominated by unionist anger at protocol and the contest between Sinn Féin and the DUP for the first minister post. That squeezed the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) and the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP), which may not have the numbers to qualify for ministerial posts. Doug Beattie, the UUP leader, was fighting to retain his own seat.",News/Politics,Sinn Féin celebrates victory but DUP warns over Northern Ireland protocol,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/07/sinn-fein-celebrates-victory-but-dup-warns-over-northern-ireland-protocol
