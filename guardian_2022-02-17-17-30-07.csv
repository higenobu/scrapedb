2/17/2022,"Bankers at Standard Chartered have shared a $1.37bn bonus pot for 2021, up 38%, even as it said it was trying to cut fixed costs, in a sign of how banks were returning to bumper payouts after weathering the Covid-19 pandemic in better shape than expected. London-headquartered Standard Chartered said the payout increase reflected a normalisation of bonuses after a lean 2020, but it also reflected a hot hiring market as lenders worldwide paid up to retain key staff.  The bigger bonus pool came as Standard Chartered set out plans to cut annual expenses by $1.5bn, as part of a broader goal to achieve double-digit returns by 2024, which it outlined on Thursday as it reported annual results. US banks that reported results last month set the tone for the return of big banker payouts, with Morgan Stanley announcing a 6% increase for its chief executive, James Gorman, and JPMorgan approving a 9% rise for Jamie Dimon, bringing his 2021 total to $34.5m. Even scandal-hit Credit Suisse, which cut its overall bonus pool in 2021, sweetened senior bankers’ pay with a surge in upfront cash and a one-off bonus. Standard Chartered said it would increase salaries across the bank by 4.8% in 2022, in common with other lenders under pressure to bolster pay as rising inflation worldwide hits real incomes. Banks are also stepping up salary increases in south-east Asia. DBS Group, the region’s largest lender, reported a 9% rise in staff expenses to $1.46bn in the second half of last year, and a similar rise for the full year, as its profit rose to a record high last year. It said it carried out base-salary increments at mid-year when the economic recovery had taken hold.",News/Business,Standard Chartered bankers share $1.37bn bonus pot,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/17/standard-chartered-bankers-bonus-2021-bank
2/17/2022,"Anthony Albanese has rounded on Scott Morrison at the end of an ugly week that saw the Coalition weaponise national security, with the Labor leader stating if people wanted to identify a “Manchurian candidate” in parliament they should look at the prime minister. Albanese’s insult followed a significant public intervention on Thursday by Australia’s respected former spy chief Dennis Richardson.  Richardson said the Morrison government was serving China’s interests, not Australia’s, by politicising national security and “seeking to create the perception of a difference [between the major parties] when none in practise exists”. Richardson’s critique of Morrison and the defence minister, Peter Dutton, prompted the chair of parliament’s intelligence committee, the Liberal senator James Paterson, to return fire, arguing the retired bureaucrat had publicly advocated in 2018 that the Chinese telco Huawei should be involved in the Australian 5G rollout. Paterson described Richardson as a “distinguished” former public servant. But the Liberal senator told Sky News the government’s decision to exclude Huawei from the 5G rollout was “one of the best decisions our government has made – and I stand by it even if Dennis Richardson disagrees”. Richardson could not immediately be reached for a response but he did not argue for unrestricted Huawei involvement. In 2018, Richardson suggested that Australia should follow the UK’s lead and establish a cyber-security unit to manage risks and safeguard Australia’s national interest, rather than banning the Chinese company outright. The high octane roiling follows several days of Morrison and Dutton attempting to paint Labor as being soft on China and weak on national security. The hyper-partisanship culminated in Morrison on Wednesday branding Labor’s deputy leader, Richard Marles, a “Manchurian candidate” – an observation he later withdrew. The phrase “Manchurian candidate” refers to a politician being used as a puppet by an enemy power. Albanese told parliament on Thursday there were few public figures better qualified than Richardson to deliver the assessment he delivered. The Labor leader noted the former bureaucrat had “the quadrella”. By that, he meant Richardson had been the head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Defence, the director-general of Asio, and Australia’s ambassador to Washington. Albanese noted former Liberal prime minister John Howard had appointed Richardson to Asio and sent him to Washington. Albanese then used Richardson’s criticism of the hyper-partisanship to turn Morrison’s insult back on the prime minister. Gesturing in Morrison’s direction in the chamber, Albanese declared after question time: “If you are looking for a Manchurian candidate, he sits over there.” Albanese told the chamber he had been engaged with Australia’s most important security ally, the United States, for more than 30 years. “I’ve never been to a rally for Donald Trump, and what we’ve seen here this week is the importation of Trumpian rhetoric, where truth doesn’t matter and facts don’t matter.” As the parliament descended further into uproar, the US reiterated it was “absolutely confident” the alliance with Australia “transcends politics and any one party” – undercutting Morrison’s effort to achieve product differentiation with Labor. The US assistant secretary of state, Daniel Kritenbrink, was asked on Thursday how confident he was that Australia’s commitment to the US alliance, the Aukus security deal, and cooperation on strategic challenges would remain strong regardless of the election outcome. “Absolutely confident is my answer,” Kritenbrink, who is responsible for the State Department’s Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, said. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and senior US officials met with both sides of Australian politics in Melbourne late last week. In a teleconference with journalists on Thursday, Kritenbrink said the US viewed the alliance with Australia as “the anchor for peace, security and stability in the Indo-Pacific”. “We also had the opportunity to meet with the opposition and we came away reassured that these principles that we hold dear and our vitally important alliance transcends politics and any one party,” Kritenbrink said. “We came away absolutely confident that whomever the Australian people select as their new leadership, as their next leadership, in the upcoming election, we’re confident that the US-Australia alliance will endure and remain as strong as ever.” The comments were carefully worded not to express any preference when it comes to the choice facing Australian voters, but they give no indication that Australia’s top ally is concerned about the implications of a change of government. Labor’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, who joined Albanese for the meeting in Melbourne last week, said Australia’s close relationship with the US was “underpinned by bipartisanship”. Australia’s close and longstanding relationship with the United States is underpinned by bipartisanship.Labor will always act in the national interest. https://t.co/tP9z32dExO Morrison persisted with his political attack despite the cross-currents. He continued to assert Albanese was “the Chinese government’s pick at this election,” while characterising him as a “weakling” and “diminishing by the day”. Dutton also declared defence spending “was a mess” when the Coalition came to power. He told parliament voters should ignore “the rhetoric that is being pumped out by the backroom bullies of the Labor party” and instead look at how Labor had “cut spending to the bone” when last in office. But Albanese sought to undercut the attack by tabling a letter Morrison sent him four months ago. In the letter, Morrison thanked Albanese for supporting Aukus and “for the bipartisan approach the opposition has taken in this vital national endeavour”. Scott Morrison recently thanked me for the ""bipartisan approach the Opposition has taken"" regarding AUKUS, in contrast to his more recent desperate scare campaign. Our national interest is above partisan politics. pic.twitter.com/rXkfZ4cg5w In an acrimonious Senate estimates hearing on Thursday, senior government frontbencher Simon Birmingham rejected the proposition that the Coalition was furthering Beijing’s interests. “I have enormous regard for Mr Richardson, but I don’t agree with his starting premise there,” the finance minister said. Birmingham argued points of difference between the parties had been created by Albanese’s own public statements, such as when the Labor leader included the word “some” when calling on Beijing to scrap its trade actions against Australian export sectors. The committee hearing was suspended after the Labor senator Tim Ayres accused the government of mounting a “grubby, reckless and shameless” line of attack, telling Birmingham: “You utterly debase yourself with this stuff.” Birmingham denied the government was making the job of Australia’s intelligence and security agencies more difficult, saying “we don’t seek to politicise it unnecessarily”. Birmingham said the track records of each party on national security and defence spending were “fair game” in a “robust democracy” and the Coalition “won’t shy away from drawing contrast where there is contrast”. The secretary of the defence department, Greg Moriarty, was cautious to steer clear of the escalating political dispute, but made a general comment that Australia’s “national resilience depends on national unity to a certain extent”. “Of course, adversaries will seek to sow division. Over many centuries that has been the case in a variety of circumstances,” Moriarty said.",News/Australia news,Anthony Albanese tells PM he’s the real ‘Manchurian candidate’ for weaponising national security,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/17/anthony-albanese-tells-pm-hes-the-real-manchurian-candidate-for-weaponising-national-security
2/17/2022,"The imperious Canada women’s hockey team completed a buzzsaw run through the Olympic tournament with a comprehensive victory over their defining foes, seeing off the United States in Thursday afternoon’s gold medal game by a 3-2 scoreline that flattered to deceive. The latest instalment in one of world sport’s most hotly contested rivalries was largely one-way traffic for the half hour when the outcome truly hung in the balance. Marie-Philip Poulin, Canada’s longtime talisman known as “Captain Clutch”, scored twice as the defending world champions opened a three-goal lead behind an aggressive forechecking attack and a standout effort by in-form goaltender Ann-Renee Desbiens, who finished with 38 saves.  “This is redemption,” said Poulin, whose brace marked her sixth and seventh goals in four career Olympic Games. “It’s just so good. It’s a great feeling. It was one hell of an effort.” Canada got off to a flying start, firing six of the first seven shots on goal until appearing to draw first blood after eight minutes when Natalie Spooner found the back of the net after a failed zone clearance by the Americans. The goal was disallowed for offsides on a USA replay challenge, but Canada took control with a goal that stuck through Sarah Nurse only 35 seconds after play resumed. Poulin doubled the advantage before the period was out, capitalizing on a gruesome USA turnover in their defensive zone. While the stat sheet at the first intermission suggested an evenly matched affair beyond the score, the well-drilled Canadian defense were limiting their opponents to mostly speculative shots on target while peppering away from closer range on USA goaltender Alex Cavallini, who finished with 18 saves. The gold medal was all but in hand after Poulin struck again midway through the second period on an assist from Nurse, whose 18th point of the tournament extended an Olympic record. The Americans pulled one back on an unassisted short-handed goal from Hilary Knight right before the second intermission, but were repeatedly thwarted by Desbiens and couldn’t get any closer until Amanda Kessel’s largely cosmetic goal on a power play with 12.5 seconds left in the game. Canada closed the show easily from there, putting the finishing touches on a seven-game Olympic masterpiece where they outscored their opponents by a 57-10 margin. A mob of red sweaters came together in celebration at the final horn as the stunned Americans looked on before several hundred spectators and volunteers at Wukesong Sports Centre, the eye-catching 15,384-seat arena in northwest Beijing’s Haidian district where LeBron James and Kobe Bryant led the USA men’s basketball team to a redemptive gold when the Olympics last came to town in 2008. “I don’t think we played up to our potential,” USA alternate captain Hilary Knight said. “Obviously we came up short. We did not get the puck to the net enough.” That Canada’s women will be at or near the top of the global scene remains one of the death-and-taxes certainties in sport, but the road to Thursday’s gold was uncommonly turbulent. After falling short of the gold in Pyeongchang for the first time in 16 years with a penalty-shootout defeat to the US, the Canadians bowed out to Finland in the semi-finals of the next year’s world championships, marking the first time in 25 appearances at the Olympics or worlds that they failed to reach the final. Change came quickly. Parry Pearn was dismissed as head coach less than three months later, replaced by Troy Ryan. Also out were longtime goaltender Shannon Szabados and defender Laura Fortino. It all paid off at last year’s worlds as Canada hoisted the trophy for the first time since 2012. In Beijing they breezed through the group stage, including a 4-2 win over the US in a dress rehearsal for Thursday’s final, before trouncing Sweden (11-0) and Switzerland (10-3) in the medal rounds. Finland took the bronze for the third time in the past four Olympics with a 4-0 win over Switzerland on Wednesday and were on hand to pick up their hardware during Thursday’s medal ceremony. “It is insane,” said Canada forward Sarah Fillier, the team’s youngest player at 21. “I can’t stop shaking. It’s a dream come true. I don’t think I can find the words.” Canada and the United States have combined to win every global title since the first official world championships in 1990 and the inaugural Olympic tournament in 1998, facing off in the final in all but two of them. Their meetings remain weighted with significance even as the ill temper and general spiciness that defined the rivalry in the early aughts has given way to a collegial professionalism and mutual respect in recent years. Their overwhelming dominance was thrust to the fore last week after a widely panned op-ed in the Toronto Star made the argument that women’s hockey doesn’t belong in the Olympics due to a competitive shortfall beyond the Big Two. But one wonders if the unassailable supremacy of neighboring countries that share the world’s longest international border can work as an asset and not a drawback. For years the Canadian and US national teams have been waiting for their “1999 moment” – a nod to Brandi Chastain’s epochal sportsbra-baring celebration to win the Women’s World Cup – that sort of societal inflection point where on-field success within a parochial sports world breaks through to a new level of popularity in the cultural mainstream. If the powers that be were smart, the US and Canada would meet in an annual best-of-seven series – a fixture with a trophy beyond the current promotional tours where they meet for exhibitions – that would keep this rivalry in the general public’s eye more than once every few years. But that’s a conversation for another day. For now Canada can celebrate holding the Olympic and world championships at the same time for the first time in nearly a decade.",Sport/Sport,‘This is redemption’: Canada beat USA to women’s ice hockey gold,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/17/this-is-redemption-canada-beat-usa-to-womens-ice-hockey-gold
2/17/2022,"The independent MP Helen Haines has left open the possibility of again attempting to legislate her federal integrity commission before the election, as another Liberal MP breaks ranks to support a “multi-partisan” approach to the vexed issue. After the prime minister, Scott Morrison, confirmed this week that the government would fail to deliver on its election commitment to introduce its own bill for a federal anti-corruption body, Haines told Parliament that the government had played “the public for a patsy”.  “I will never stop bringing this to the attention of this House, even in the dying days of this parliament,” Haines said. “The prime minister’s laughable excuse that he cannot legislate his integrity commission proposal because the opposition won’t support it is totally absurd. “The legislating of a federal integrity commission was a character test for this prime minister and his government, and I stand here today saying he has failed that character test.” Haines also accused Morrison of misleading her over the issue, saying he had initially suggested he wanted to work on the issue in a bipartisan way, but this had not happened. She said the government had undertaken “fake consultation” on its bill, which was released as a draft in November 2020 and underwent an extensive public consultation process last year. “The facts are clear. He had no intention of working on this in a bipartisan way,” she said.The Liberal MP Bridget Archer - who crossed the floor last year to support Haines’s bill - said it remained her view that legislating an integrity commission remained “one of the most important things” Parliament needed to do. However, she cast doubt on the ability for Haines’ bill to be supported before the election, with just one sitting week for the federal budget remaining before the election. “I do believe that this issue needs to be debated. It is also clear that this parliament is running out of time to be able to legislate an integrity bill. “I’ve continued to have those discussions over summer, and they had been met in good faith. But I don’t think that we are going to get there in this term of Parliament,” she said. “I would just urge all parties to put the politics aside and come back here to the 47th Parliament in good faith and get this done.” The outgoing Liberal MP John Alexander, who told Guardian Australia he would consider crossing the floor to support Haines’s bill if it again came to a vote before the election, joined Archer, Haines and other crossbench MPs on Thursday to call for a multi-partisan approach to the issue. “We must stop bashing heads, and instead put our heads together to work our way forward,” Alexander said. “This is too important to play politics with, because we’ve seen what happens around the world when people lose trust in their elected representatives. “So let’s form a team. A team is a group of people who come together with a common goal. Let’s form a team to represent Australians, to ensure honesty and integrity as the foundations for those who represent us and those who seek to lead.” This week, Morrison defended the government’s failure to progress the bill, attempting to blame the Labor party for not supporting the bill. “We’ve tabled our legislation for that integrity commission. The Labor Party don’t support it, and that’s why it’s not proceeding.” But the decision to shelve the legislation has angered many Liberal MPs, particularly those fighting off challenges from independents in Liberal-held metropolitan seats who have made integrity a key campaign issue. The Liberal MPs Jason Falinski and Celia Hammond previously told Guardian Australia that the government should introduce the bill before the election to kick start debate on the issue and fulfil the government’s election pledge.

2/17/2022,"It is fitting that Rangers’ highest-profile European occasion in more than a decade falls this week. Valentine’s Day marked 10 years since the club tumbled into administration, sparked by a series of events Rangers would rather forget and those in charge of Scottish football would be well advised to remember. There is some wonderful, exaggerated nonsense said and written about Rangers’ rise from the bottom domestic tier to champions – their economic scale is untouched by 40 of 41 other Scottish clubs – but recent seasons have seen credibility restored against foreign opposition.  The Rangers of 2022 will relish a Europa League meeting with Borussia Dortmund while mindful of more meaningful hurdles ahead. The reawakening of Celtic under Ange Postecoglou is such that Rangers, having won the title with six matches to spare last March, find themselves embroiled in a domestic scrap. Rangers’ recent decline was painfully exposed by a 3-0 Old Firm trouncing this month. The scoreline flattered Giovanni van Bronckhorst’s team. Having supposedly identified domestic cups as a key area for improvement in 2021-22, Rangers were comfortably bundled out of the League Cup by Hibs. It would of course have been hard to maintain last season’s extraordinary levels of consistency, but building on success was a reasonable expectation. Rangers fans have cause to ask precisely why this has transpired from such a position of power, not least given the depressing weakness of all but one domestic opponent. Borussia Dortmund v Rangers: a tie for those who once regarded such fixtures as the norm. The winning of Scotland’s Premiership last May understandably triggered euphoric scenes around Ibrox. Pieced together, life should be pretty rosy for followers of the club. Yet this is a team who, seemingly rejuvenated by Van Bronckhorst’s arrival to replace Steven Gerrard, led the league by six points on Boxing Day. They now trail by one with Celtic holding the footballing momentum in Glasgow. The significance of this goes far beyond who takes delivery of a flag: the likelihood of automatic Champions League entry for this season’s champions means, in fiscal terms, this should be the most valuable title in Scottish history. Van Bronckhorst can enjoy the limelight here in Dortmund for the first leg even if his main role is to return what was a 2/1-on bet before a ball was kicked. Now, astonishingly, Rangers are the underdogs. Ross Wilson, the Rangers sporting director, is never shy about trying to drum up positive publicity. Wilson was on club media outlets to herald a job well done in the January transfer window 24 hours before Celtic’s derby win. The reality is that Rangers’ transfer model has been highly questionable for some time, glaringly emphasised when Malmö turfed them out of this season’s Champions League. The sale of Nathan Patterson, an academy graduate who barely featured in the first team, scarcely masks the failure to prevent steep value loss on others. There is, of course, Aaron Ramsey. The signing of the midfielder on loan from Juventus is a coup but Rangers have sleepwalked towards the point where this caffeine boost was sorely needed. They would have been better off signing a defender – Rangers can be laughably weak at the back – but presumably market forces dictated otherwise. In another bizarre public intervention, on Tuesday Ramsey’s agent, David Baldwin, used social media to describe an inoffensive column as “stupid”, “disrespectful” and “rag journalism”. Rangers and their online warriors lapped up the sentiment. Not only was it unimpressive in respect of the pile-on it inevitably triggered towards the person who wrote the piece, it suggested unease rather than relaxation. Ramsey, 31 and having last played 90 minutes in October, will complete the season against clubs such as St Johnstone, Dundee and St Mirren. It was not meant to be this way when he signed a £400,000-a-week deal in Italy in the summer of 2019. Aside from Ramsey – who we are entitled to believe can influence games in Scotland – there are other reasons for Rangers optimism. The temperamental Alfredo Morelos has returned to his prolific best. That the team rebounded from an embarrassing evening at Celtic by dismissing Hearts and Hibs suggests there is no problem with morale. Celtic’s rebuild has been so swift that there is no guarantee they will not wilt as the season goes on. In Europe, under Gerrard and Van Bronckhorst, Rangers have reached levels that add to their reputation as a team. The true challenges, though, are far closer to home. Dortmund are a free hit.",Sport/Football,Rangers can enjoy Dortmund glamour tie as retaining title remains key,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/17/rangers-can-enjoy-dortmund-glamour-tie-as-retaining-title-remains-key
2/17/2022,"On 15 September 2021, Sidy Keita from Ivory Coast and Didier Martial Kouamou Nana from Cameroon, boarded a dinghy from Turkey to Greece. Despite making it to the Greek island of Samos, their bodies were found days later, washed ashore in Aydin province, on the Aegean coast. Interviews with more than a dozen witnesses, analysis of classified documents, satellite imagery, social media accounts and online material, and discussions with officials in Turkey and Greece, have helped piece together what happened over five September days during which the two men died, likely victims of a pushback by the Greek authorities.  What happened to these men, who left their homes to escape political oppression and for a better life overseas, has been investigated by the Guardian, Lighthouse Reports, Mediapart and Der Spiegel. The Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has frequently denied that pushbacks occur. But there is mounting evidence that would-be asylum seekers are being illegally removed from Greek territory before having the chance to lodge asylum applications. Keita, 36, left Ivory Coast after taking part in protests against president Alassane Ouattara. He arrived in Turkey in March 2020. Kouamou, 33, a mechanic in Cameroon, landed in Turkey last year, hoping to join his brother who had been living in France since 2014. Like many before them, both men went to the Basmane district of Izmir, a known spot for people who want to be smuggled into Europe. They were among 36 who then boarded a dinghy from near Kusadasi on the Turkish coast in the early hours of 15 September. According to testimonies, the boat arrived at the north-eastern shore of Samos around 7am, just as the sun was rising. The area, Cape Prasso, is a peninsula with steep hillsides and perilous drops to the water. Lawyers working for the Human Rights Legal Project (HRLP) on Samos, 10km from Cape Prasso, received a text from an unknown number informing them of the dinghy’s arrival, with photos taken from land of a Greek coastguard vessel spotted in the area. At 10.25am, the HRLP emailed local police, the UN refugee agency UNHCR, a member of the European Commission based on the island and the Reception and Identification service for asylum seekers on Samos, informing them of the arrival. The HRLP email, seen by the Guardian, asks that the arrivals be provided with the necessary assistance to register as asylum seekers on the island as prescribed by law. There was no reply. Shortly after the dinghy arrived, witnesses describe hearing what sounded like shots being fired. In a panic, the people on the dinghy split up, scrambling up the hilly terrain to hide where they could. Eight managed to escape into the countryside but the other 28, including a baby, young children and a pregnant woman, were apprehended by the authorities. That afternoon, it is claimed they were loaded on to a coastguard boat, driven out to sea and cast adrift on two life rafts, a well-documented form of pushback by Greek authorities. Jean* and at least two others were allegedly strip-searched and beaten. Jean said at least one woman was subjected to an internal physical search by officers looking for money. “The police beat us with the greatest violence,” he said. “I was punched in the face and in the stomach. I was crying.” Pascaline* said she was robbed of her money and her baby was thrown into the life raft “as if you were throwing a garbage can”. “We have to denounce this because it’s inhuman. They hit people in front of us, they traumatised the children.” The two rafts were picked up by the Turkish coastguard a few hours later. The pregnant woman had gone into labour on the raft and delivered her baby shortly after being rescued. Of the eight people who initially escaped the authorities in Samos, four would make it to a refugee camp on the island, while the other four were picked up. One woman was apprehended outside a monastery, given a bottle of water and cast out to sea on her own. She was rescued by the Turkish coastguard on 17 September. After sleeping in the forest overnight, Keita, Kouamou and another man, Ibrahim*, were apprehended on 16 September. Ibrahim, a former member of the Cameroonian navy, said they were stopped on a road by people identifying themselves as police officers. They were asked for ID and stripped of their phones and money before being put into a car and taken to a port. Ibrahim said they were then loaded on to a speedboat, which he identified as a Rafnar, a vessel used by the coastguard on Samos. After half an hour, the boat stopped and Ibrahim says that, one by one, the men were pushed into the water. “I resisted,” he said. “They beat me properly before throwing me into the water.” He said he swam desperately, the waves helping push him towards the Turkish shore and on to the beach a few hours from Kusadasi. He said he cried out thanks to God before vomiting. According to Ibrahim, Keita’s body washed up soon after. Friends said neither Keita nor Kouamou could swim. Ibrahim tried resuscitation but it was too late. Ibrahim planted a stick in the sand next to Keita’s body and started walking along the coast. He was picked up by Turkish police on 18 September, and described to them the events which led to Keita’s death. “They pushed all of us into the sea,” he told the authorities. “They did not provide us with a raft or boat.” He said Kouamou had disappeared beneath the waves. Later that day, Keita’s body was found by the Turkish coastguard. Two days later, they found Kouamou on the same beach. Ibrahim later identified both bodies in the morgue in Izmir. Medical documents state that Keita drowned and that Kouamou’s body had been found in the sea, close to shore. While it is impossible to fully verify Ibrahim’s story, two Greek officials with direct knowledge of coastguard operations, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed that what he described had happened before, usually to smaller groups of asylum seekers. The rationale is to avoid using life rafts, which are expensive; any public tender for their replacement might raise questions. Both officials said refugees are usually provided with lifejackets before being told to swim back to Turkey. Since December, the Turkish coastguard have recorded 11 rescues of people in similar circumstances. Over tea in Izmir in October, Ibrahim said he believed it was partly down to God that he survived. “The sea is my friend, I have no fear,” he said. He has since made it back to Greece, where he has registered as a minor. The Guardian cannot verify his age. Months later, he is still haunted by what happened. “I feel like I left a part of me in the water,” he said. Dimitris Choulis, a HRLP lawyer, is filing a lawsuit pressing for criminal charges to be brought against those involved in the pushback on behalf of some of the 36 people who made that journey on 15 September. “What is very dangerous for our democracy is having police officers overstepping the law,” he said. “My hope is, as a Greek lawyer, to restore the rule of law in the island of Samos, because this is what seems to have been lost.” Lorraine Leete, from the Legal Centre Lesbos, added: “Pushbacks constitute atrocities against the humankind for which Greece and the EU will have to respond sooner or later, given the hard and accumulated evidence of crimes committed at their borders.” Kouamou’s body was returned to Cameroon, thanks to savings from his older brother, Séverin. He leaves behind a wife and two young children. “The news of his death broke us all,” said his aunt, Marinette. “His death left me traumatised to have lost such a good son.” Keita’s family could not raise the money to bring him back to Ivory Coast, and he lies in an unmarked grave in Izmir, thousands of miles from home. In a statement, the Greek police authorities said: “The Hellenic police authorities, following a strict disciplinary legal framework, investigate every piece of information which is communicated to them and concerns alleged incidents of ill treatment at the borders, including allegations for unprocessed returns (pushbacks), in order that the foreseen by law penalties are imposed and similar behaviours are avoided in the future. The allegations on the breach of the principle of non-refoulement do not meet reality and in fact undermine the work of the Hellenic police at the operational border areas.” The Greek coastguard did not respond to requests for comment. *Names have been changed",News/Global development,‘It’s an atrocity against humankind’: Greek pushback blamed for double drowning,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/17/its-an-atrocity-against-humankind-greek-pushback-blamed-for-double-drowning
2/17/2022,"On Sunday an Olympic spokesperson actually put out a statement explaining that the Games’ flame in the Bird’s Nest stadium hadn’t gone out. “The flame is fine,” they said when approached by USA Today, whose photographer Rob Schumacher published a shot that suggested it was very much not. Somewhere else in the Olympic village, irony keeled over and died. I’ve had one eye on the vaguely dystopian spectacle of these Games, a hyperreal propaganda-spectacular played out, in part, on phoney snow and against the backdrop of an abandoned steel mill. The other has been reading about what IOC president Thomas Bach calls the “boycott ghosts of the past”, and in particular the story of Rudi Ball.  The Olympic boycott movement really began in 1936, before the infamous summer Games in Berlin, and the less well-known winter Games held in Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Bavaria earlier that same year. There was no formal boycott in the end, despite all the many calls for one, because the IOC – and in particular its future president Avery Brundage, who was then running the American Olympic Committee – overrode everyone else’s concerns and accepted the Nazi party’s reassurances that everything was (here’s that word again) fine. Years later, researchers at the Simon Wiesenthal Centre would prove that Brundage’s construction firm received a contract to build the new German Embassy in Washington because of his “friendly attitude to German sports”. Not that he needed the sweetener, “any more than Bill Clinton would need a bribe to support Hillary”, said Brundage’s biographer, Allen Guttmann. So the decision about whether or not to boycott those Winter Games became a personal choice. Many, like British skier Peter Lunn, refused to attend the opening procession, while others, such as the two-time Olympic bobsled champion Billy Fiske, refused to go to the Games at all. Rudi Ball, though, found himself facing an even more difficult decision. Ball, who was born in Berlin in 1911, was the star turn on the Berliner SC ice hockey team that won the German national championship for six years in a row between 1928 and 1933, and was one of the best players on the national side that won the bronze medal at the Lake Placid Olympics in 1932. He was also half-Jewish. Which meant he shouldn’t have been facing a decision at all, since, from 1933 onwards, the Reich Sports Office had introduced an “Aryans only” policy in all German sports organisations. Ball moved to St Moritz after that, in what the papers described as “self-exile”, and then to Milan, where he played for the Diavoli Rossoneri, who won the Italian national championship, and the prestigious Spengler Cup in St Moritz, in 1935. By then, he was playing better than ever. Of course, when it came to whether or not he would be picked to play for the German national team again at their home Olympics, the pressing question wasn’t his form. Ball died in 1975, and the details of exactly what happened in those few weeks were lost with him. The story goes that the German captain, Gustav Jaenecke, told the authorities that he would refuse to play unless Ball was selected. This is the version presented in Tom McNab’s play 1936: Berlin, and elsewhere. The Nazis certainly used Ball as part of the PR campaign they ran to ward off the threat of the boycott. “All German athletes who fulfil the Olympic conditions will be welcome,” said the secretary general of the German Olympic Committee, Dr Carl Diem. “We have already included the Jewish sportsman Rudi Ball as a member of the ice hockey team.” Ball’s brilliant performance in Germany’s first match, a 1-0 defeat to the USA, was reported around the world. “Nazis Cheer a Jew” was one headline, “Brilliant Playing of Rudi Ball Moves German Fans to Applause” another. It was also reported that Ball had been coerced into playing. A “highly reliable source” told a reporter from the Australian Jewish News that Ball “is taking part in the Olympic Games against his own will”. Ball himself hinted that this may have been the case in an interview he gave to the Canadian foreign correspondent Matthew Halton, who asked him how he “could bear” to play for Nazi Germany. Ball, who always referred to the Germans as “they”, rather than “we”, told Halton that refusing to play wouldn’t have done German Jews any good, “and it might have done them harm”. Halton wrote that he couldn’t repeat some of their conversation, which, his son David Halton later suggested, was “certainly a code that Ball feared to say the worst of what was happening”. Ball’s mother and father were still living in Berlin at that point. And here we get a real hint of why Ball made the decision he did. It has been suggested that Ball struck a deal with the Nazi regime in which he agreed to play on the proviso that his parents were allowed out of the country. And, when you look through the emigration records, there they are, Leonhard and Gertrude Ball, on the passenger list for the SS Windsor Castle, sailing from Southampton to Cape Town on 3 July 1936. They didn’t come back. Ball joined them after the war, which he spent back in Germany, playing for his old club, SC Berlin. In his last interview, given in 1970, Ball was asked whether he was a forgotten man, and if the sport owed him more recognition, “I am the one who owes hockey,” he replied, “it saved me and my family from the holocaust.”",Sport/Sport,The Jewish ice hockey star picked by Germany for 1936 Winter Olympics | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/17/rudi-ball-jewish-ice-hockey-star-germany-1936-winter-olympics
2/17/2022,"Leading shark scientists have called for calm after the tragic death of a male swimmer at a beach in Sydney’s east on Wednesday. Dr Vanessa Pirotta, a marine predator researcher at Macquarie University, said the incident at Little Beach had shaken the community because of its sheer randomness.  “It’s not every day you hear of a shark incident like this was,” she said. “That’s why there’s so many people talking about it, and the fact people have seen it first-hand means there’s a lot that plays on people’s minds.” Swimmers have been warned against entering the water at 13 of Sydney’s beaches, from Bondi in the east to Cronulla in the south, after human remains of a 35-year-old man were found on Wednesday afternoon. New South Wales police are continuing to scour the water looking for the shark responsible, while the NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI) deployed six SMART drumlines on Thursday morning from Little Bay beach to Long Bay. Surf lifesavers were using drones and jet skis to check the immediate area. Pirotta said the community’s shock was understandable, but it was also important to remember sharks still played an “important ecological role” in Australia’s marine environment. She said there was no need for beachgoers to feel there was a heightened risk swimming in the coming days. “Remember people do swim in the water every day, and this unfortunately has resulted in a tragic, uncommon event,” she said. “Beachgoers will be thinking about their actions which is completely normal … my advice is adhere to swimming between flags and where there’s surveillance in areas well patrolled.” The attack was the first shark-related fatality in Sydney waters since 1963. On Thursday afternoon the Department of Primary Industries confirmed the species responsible was likely to be a great white shark at least three metres in length based on provided footage. Pirotta said the shark could have been passing through the area for a number of reasons including following prey as well as favourable currents or water temperatures. “Unfortunately it’s an opportunistic incident,” she said. “If we look at white shark distribution in Australia, they’re known to be found along the coastal areas as well as shelves and continental areas. “[But] shark incidents like this do not happen every day, this is why we’re so taken aback.” The average number of shark incidents in Australia has risen to 12.5 a year in the past decade compared to 6.5 during the 1990s, but still remains relatively low and fatalities have decreased. According to the Australian Shark Attack File maintained by Taronga Conservation Society there were 17 unprovoked shark attacks in 2021. Of those, three were fatal, 11 caused injury and three people were unharmed. The odds of being killed by a shark in Australia are one in 8m, similar to that of being killed by a kangaroo. The increase in shark incidents is linked to Australia’s growing population, rather than more sharks. In fact, there has been a significant decline in coastal predators in the past 50 years. According to a 2018 study conducted on the east coast, the number of great white sharks had declined by 92%. Dr Leonardo Guida, shark scientist at the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said shark bites were traumatic incidents which “while rare, require[d] thoughtful, evidence based action”. “First of all we want to extend our sympathies to the friends and family of the swimmer who died in this tragedy, first responders and to those who witnessed it,” he said. “Empathy, respect and clear communication are crucial – it’s an emotionally charged event for local communities and the feeling of anger is perfectly understandable.” But he said installing drumlines or using shark nets to catch and kill sharks were less effective at improving safety compared to the use of newer technology like drones and warning systems. Queensland has reduced the number of beaches where shark nets and drumlines are used to 86 beaches, as it trials new technology including drones and smart drumlines. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Last year, the Humane Society International found nearly 80% of sharks caught on drum lines in the Great Barrier Reef marine park in 2020 died, despite an administrative appeals tribunal ordering the government to move to a nonlethal program. In NSW, a shark management program was expanded last year to place drumlines that provide real time alerts at 170 beaches and use shark-spotting drones at 50 beaches. Western Australia’s shark culling program was abandoned in 2014 after an evaluation by the state’s Environmental Protection Authority. “Baited hooks and dead animals caught in shark nets can attract more sharks to the area,” Guida said. “We have the tools and knowhow to modernise and improve beach safety standards that benefit humans and wildlife alike.”",News/Environment,Marine scientists call for calm after swimmer killed by shark in Sydney,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/17/marine-scientists-call-for-calm-after-swimmer-killed-by-shark-in-sydney
2/17/2022,"An EU action plan to deal with fishing practices that trawl the ocean floor is set to trigger a row between conservationists and a new industry alliance that says it is fighting for Europe’s culture and identity. About 32% of Europe’s fish are caught by industrial fishing vessels that rake the sea floor with enormous nets in a process called bottom trawling. Studies indicate that these nets can suck up to 41% of all invertebrate life from the sea floor and cause grave damage to marine environments such as cold water coral reefs and seagrass beds.  Bottom-trawling is already banned by the EU at depths of more than 800 metres but the European Commission has promised to implement whatever restrictions it deems necessary to further limit the practice, which it called “the most damaging activity to the seabed”. A delayed package of recommendations and announcements now expected in the spring could include a ban on bottom-trawling in marine protected areas (MPAs). The fishing industry, however, is preparing to fight back with the formal launch of the European Bottom Fishing Alliance (EBFA) later this month. Formed in response to a petition signed by 150,000 people in December calling for an immediate ban on bottom trawling in MPAs, the alliance unites fishing associations across 14 countries. The group argues that bottom trawling is “very sustainable” because of certification schemes such as the one run by the Marine Stewardship Council and because vessels already have to comply with environmental constraints imposed by the EU’s common fisheries policy. New trawling curbs could create a supply squeeze with the potential to price many common fish species such as sole, turbot, plaice, halibut and shrimps out of European menus, EBFA says. “We don’t want to see an industry catering for the rich,” said Ivan López, chair of EBFA, who runs a trawling business in Spain. “It would not be fair if fish became a luxury product.” Seafood is a “culture and identity” issue in Spain, he added. Others are critical of these arguments. While trawling restrictions could raise prices for a period, said Joachim Claudet, a senior scientist at France’s National Centre for Scientific Research, “ecosystems would recover quite quickly if we stopped trawling, and that would mean there would be more fish to catch with more sustainable practices.” Rebecca Hubbard, programme director of the Our Fish campaign group, described the new industry offensive as “a desperate greenwashing initiative in defence of the indefensible”. The issue is escalating into a battle, said Nicolas Fournier, campaign director of the Oceana conservation group, which argues for practices such as long-line fishing, and eating more locally-caught and less threatened species. “If we are to seize this opportunity to tackle bottom-trawling, it’s basically now or never,” he said. Brussels has pledged to establish protected areas for at least 30% of Europe’s seas but, under EU law, MPAs have specific objectives, such as protecting seabirds, crustaceans or other marine features. Their effectiveness is contested, however. Fournier said that their benefits often exist mainly on paper and that shipping, dredging, oil and gas drilling, aquaculture, harbour developments and windfarms can still be permitted in MPAs. One tenth of Europe’s waters have marine protected status but more than 2.5m hours of bottom trawling took place within them in 2020, according to research by Oceana. “In some areas, bottom trawling is prohibited in order to protect the seabed, but many other [MPAs] focus on other features and therefore don’t regulate bottom trawling,” said one EU official, who did not want to be named. “It’s a nonsense that ‘protected’ areas can allow trawling, which is one of the most damaging human activities at sea,” Claudet said. The EBFA cites studies by the University of Washington academic Ray Hillborn to support its case for allowing bottom trawling in MPAs on a case-by-case basis – in areas where seabirds are being protected but the seabed is not, for example. However, “if seabirds are eating fish or organisms from the seabed, you can’t treat them in isolation from the rest of their ecosystem,” said Prof Clare Bradshaw of Stockholm University. A European Commission spokesperson said it had to weigh any new measures against the economic effects they could have on an industry sector that makes up a quarter of the EU fishing fleet. “We will not aim for a blanket approach by banning all gears in all waters,” the official said. “Instead, we will look at how best to protect the seabed and work on the basis of science to see how to balance the decisions.” Some research also suggests that beyond biodiversity loss, sedimentary disturbances from bottom trawling may cause more CO2 releases than the world’s entire aviation fleet. All of which creates newfound uncertainty for an EU fishing sector which, critics say, has been accustomed to punching above its weight in Brussels. Fishers, like farmers, carry significant lobbying clout but many believe they have lost out in debates over catch limits and Brexit, and could now bump up against further restrictions. “We feel that the green deal is pushing too much on to the fisheries,” said Lopez. “We feel the argument is too skewed in one direction on the [environmental] issue,” he added, “and it’s not ours.”",News/Environment,Europe’s fishing industry to battle with conservationists over bottom trawling,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/17/europes-fishing-industry-to-battle-with-conservationists-over-bottom-trawling
2/17/2022,"The Winter Olympics have been plunged into further controversy after Beijing 2022 spokesperson Yan Jiarong dismissed human rights violations among the Uyghur muslim population as “lies” - and then insisted Taiwan was part of China. Yan, a former member of the Chinese delegation to the UN General Assembly, referred to “so-called forced labour” in Xinjiang in response to one question, before insisting China was against the “politicising of sports”.  She again intervened when a question was raised regarding the IOC’s position on reports of concentration camps and forced labour in Xinjiang. “I think these questions are based on lies,” Yan said. “Some authorities have already disputed such false information with a lot of solid evidence. You are very welcome to refer to all that evidence and facts.” The issue of internment camps in Xinjiang was a major issue before these Games, with the US warning of a “genocide” in the region before leading a diplomatic boycott by several countries, including Britain and Canada. Those countries, and human rights groups say that more than one million Uyghurs are subjected to forced labour and reeducation, and in some cases even sterilisation. However the subject has largely taken a backseat in the past fortnight, as athletes’ concerns about Covid isolation camps and then the failed drugs of 15-year-old Russian skater Kamila Valieva have captured more of the public’s attention. But the issue was reignited in a remarkable final joint press conference held by the International Olympic Committee and the Beijing organisers, during which Yan dismissed questions about the issues in Xinjiang. Asked after the conference about whether she had meant her “lies” comment, she said: ““Yes, yes. But this is not the relevant department. The foreign ministry and other ministries have released lots and lots of facts and data to refute these kind of allegations.” Meanwhile the IOC presidential spokesperson Mark Adams insisted that none of its uniforms were made by workers or from raw materials from the region. He added that Yan’s view was “not particularly relevant to the press conference or the IOC”, insisting the organisation was “very concerned about protecting human rights within our sphere of the Olympic Games”. “We leave it to other organisations, the United Nations, other organisations, to look at other aspects outside of what is happening here,” he added. “The Games themselves bring a great deal of benefit to the world in terms of showing how people can work together and bring a shared feeling about what the world could be like. “Even administrations around the world who have boycotted these Games politically understand the importance of having ways of reaching out, talking and having areas of cooperation. “Bringing the world together is even more important at a time like this when there is such dispute and there can be areas of discussion and debate.” The IOC has repeatedly insisted the Games should be free from politics, but when asked about Taiwan, Yan again stressed the Chinese government’s position, saying: “There is only one China in the world.” That is not a view shared by most of the rest of the world, which recognises Taiwan as a separate and independent country. However Yan claimed: “Taiwan is an individable part of China. This is a well recognised international principle and well recognised in the international community. We are always against the idea of politicising the Olympic Games. IOC has 206 members including People’s Republic China National Olympic Committee, including Chinese Taipei, the original Olympic Committee.”",Sport/Sport,Beijing 2022 organisers claim stories of Xinjiang human rights abuses are ‘lies’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/17/beijing-2022-organisers-claim-stories-of-xinjiang-human-rights-abuses-are-lies
2/17/2022,"In June 1802, the German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt ascended the inactive volcano Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador. As he climbed from tropical rainforest towards the snow-covered peak almost 21,000ft above sea level, he acquired a new vision of nature, interwoven with “a thousand threads”. It was like taking a journey from the equator to the poles: an entire world of diversity collapsed on to this single mountain, a “microcosm on one page”. Here Humboldt began to develop the notion he called Naturgemälde, a scarcely translatable word that implies a unity or wholeness in nature.  Humboldt is often credited with the idea of an ecosystem as a web of interdependent living species, each playing a part in supporting the whole. But as conservation biologist Thor Hanson says in Hurricane Lizards and Plastic Squid, Chimborazo also opened the intrepid German naturalist’s eyes to another profound realisation: climate, not mere geographical location, “dictated what grew where, and similar vegetation should occur in any place where temperature, humidity and other conditions were the same, regardless of geography”. The corollary – when climate changes, ecosystems must change too – is the topic of Hanson’s book. The simplest outcome is a shifting of boundaries separating different climatic zones: as temperatures rise, temperate flora and fauna will move poleward. If that were all there was to it, climate change would rearrange but not otherwise perturb the mosaic of life that Humboldt identified. But it isn’t so straightforward. The responses of the natural world to the changes that human activities have induced in our climate range from the alarming, such as species extinctions, to the creative. The natural world is resilient, but to different degrees in different places and among different organisms. What’s more, timescales matter: adaptations feasible over the slow climate shifts that have happened naturally in the distant past might not be managed in the face of today’s rapid warming. Nature is doing what it can, but it is confused and often imperilled. It’s a somewhat guilty pleasure, then, to revel in Hanson’s globetrotting exploits, some of them conducted under the constraints of the pandemic. We are taken from the rainforests of Costa Rica to the Arctic ice of Franz Josef Land and the coral reefs of Indonesia. The range of species he investigates and the climate responses they exhibit are sometimes dizzying, but some general features emerge. When confronted with a climate shift – warmer ocean or air temperatures, say, or altered patterns of rainfall or melting ice – organisms have several options. They can migrate to where the original conditions still prevail, or they can try to adapt their behaviour to the new. In some cases they can evolve: Darwinian natural selection is often imagined to happen slowly over millennia, but it can take place much more quickly (as the coronavirus reminds us). As they decimate populations, sudden and extreme changes in climate are a brutally selective filter. The “hurricane lizards” of the title are those individuals in a species of Caribbean lizard whose stronger grip, thanks to larger toe pads, allowed them to survive more frequent hurricanes by clinging to trees and shrubs. Another option is that organisms find niches in their existing habitat where the original conditions persist: so-called refugia, such as slopes sheltered from the sun. Whether this is a viable long-term solution is not clear – but it has so far sustained populations of rabbit-like American pikas in the western Rockies, which find their preferred cooler conditions preserved in the cold air that gathers over scree slopes, even while the snowpack elsewhere retreats. But amid these diverse strategies, the ecosystem as a whole may still be disrupted. It’s no good one species adapting to stay put if its main food source has migrated elsewhere. And as climate change moves the boundaries of the seasons, the delicate interlocking of growth patterns may be thrown out of kilter. “Timing is everything in ecosystems,” Hanson writes. “If plants at the foot of trees have not finished their bloom and growth before the trees overhead come into leaf and block much of the sunlight, they’re in trouble.” Hanson supplies abundant reason to marvel at nature’s ingenuity, but also to fear for it in the face of the drastic changes we are generating. He reminds us that our own responses, as we try to adjust to wildfires, heatwaves and sea level rise, are a part of that story too. “It’s now a running joke that every biologist in the world is studying the effects of climate change,” he writes. “Some of them just don’t know it yet.” It’s a good joke, but nothing to laugh about.
