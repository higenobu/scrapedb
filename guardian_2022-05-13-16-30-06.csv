5/13/2022,"The spirit of sparky high school comedies, from Never Been Kissed to Mean Girls to Easy A, haunts Netflix’s junky “if you like…” offering Senior Year, with a progressively deafening reminder of what came before. For where those films had charm, wit and vim, this has a stultifying absence instead, a disappointing and derivative two-hour slog down memory lane. It at least looks like the movies it desperately wants to be grouped together with, a quick tip-off to its origins, made by Paramount before being off-loaded to Netflix. British director Alex Hardcastle, best known for sitcom work, does an impressive job of fooling us into thinking we’re in safe hands with a slick and poppy aesthetic before the script, from Andrew Knauer, Arthur Pielli and actor Brandon Scott Jones, reminds us that we’re very much not, the loosely familiar framework of a sturdy studio comedy crumbling with every ill-advised decision made. The illest of all is the choice to cast Rebel Wilson in the lead, an often adept comic performer who works best as quippy support (funny in both Bridesmaids and 2015’s underrated How to Be Single) but who often struggles in the more substantive spotlight (patchy in 2019’s rom-com spoof Isn’t It Romantic). She’s handed a very specific acting challenge here that demands more than she can really give, playing a woman waking up from a 20-year coma after a cheerleading accident at school. She might look 37 but she’s got the mind of a 17-year-old (there’s a knotty psychodrama that could have grown out of this premise) and so her every move must reflect this confusing discordance. Before her lies great examples of actors who have effortlessly managed something similar, from Jennifer Garner in 13 Going on 30 or Tom Hanks in Big or more recently a surprisingly textured Vince Vaughn in Freaky, but a miscast Wilson never convinces as someone figuring out the intricacies of a new body and new life, a simple, surface-level performance not helped by a script that also doesn’t fully grapple with the actual day-to-day details or genuine comedy of such a surreal experience. Instead it’s mere montage fodder – confusing Lady Gaga for Madonna, learning how to use Instagram, insisting on a Real World: New Orleans prom theme – and so cloying late-stage sentiment, of which there is a lot, is markedly ineffective. There’s proven comic mileage in comparing the nature of high school life then and now, something 21 Jump Street handled well, the leads forced to reconfigure their ideas of popularity and how to wear a backpack. But here it’s all far too broad with the film’s over-egged vision of kombucha-drinking mini-activists who embrace their gender fluidity while trying to combat climate change feeling lazy and a little too mean-spirited, as if they were all written with an exhausted eye-roll. The adult characters don’t fare that well either although there are enthusiastic turns from Sam Richardson as the old friend with a crush, Happiest Season breakout Mary Holland as the BFF-turned-principal, Justin Hartley as the old jock boyfriend and Zoe Chao trying to wring laughs from some frustratingly un-spiky dialogue as the bitter ex-queen bee. But despite the bloated runtime, the script still doesn’t find enough time to flesh out any of these dynamics, each missing a handful of vital beats. Tonally, it’s all over the place, that aforementioned sap curdled together with Wilson’s trademark crudeness, an R-rated comedy that wants to be both sweet and salty, a balance it never manages to perfect. So dick size jokes and wearied putdowns like butt slut crash up against asinine Live Laugh Love life lessons like “why fit in when you can stand out?” and “the perfect life online means nothing when you’re miserable in real life”, the film resembling a goody two shoes kid who just learned a dirty word. The film’s aggressive overload of nostalgia, squarely targeted at a thirtysomething audience, is best summarised by a sequence where Wilson’s character lovingly re-enacts the video to Britney’s 1999 hit (You Drive Me) Crazy. There’s no attempt to add any real humour or any kind of inventive spin to the performance, it just … is. That scene, and the film’s use of pop culture in general, recalls Charles Bramesco’s incisive review of Ghostbusters: Afterlife, where he noted “a peculiar breed of fan more interested in identifying objects than what’s done with them”. For those who take pleasure in the performative act of pointing and nodding to show they know what that song or TV show reference is then, there’s plenty here to annoy whomever you’re trying to impress, others who demand a little more might feel short-changed. It’s also indicative of a certain brand of tiresome comedy where we’re expected to have fun simply because those on screen seem to be but it’s simply not enough and the ending, with two frenetic musical dance numbers, similarly fails to have the contagious effect the makers seem to think it does. Senior Year might get a passing grade for sheer energy but for everything else, it’s a fail.

5/13/2022,"Your music has helped me in understanding times of my life and what I thought were ineffable emotions. What records or artists were the first to make a lasting impact on you or helped to immerse you in the musical world? carolinemurray I started listening to a lot of classic records via my parents – the Everly Brothers, the Mamas and the Papas, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones – but the first records that I found on my own that I connected with deeply were Elastica’s Elastica, Liz Phair’s Whip-Smart and Nine Inch Nails’ Pretty Hate Machine. I was in junior high when I first heard them. I was a pretty angsty kid – but quietly anxious, a door-slammer – and I would blast music so loud and write in my journal. I did not know how to express myself at all, and I’m still working on it; my journals have turned into my music. Elastica was so driven and playful and sexy, Liz Phair was tough but poetic and I loved her angular guitar playing. I loved the industrial nature of Nine Inch Nails and it was definitely the epitome of teenage angst. I was just like: “Wow, maybe I am depressed? I didn’t even know!” Your impassioned live rendition of Seventeen continues to burn bright in the memory. Which live performers have left the biggest impression on you? VerulamiumParkRanger Nick Cave is probably No 1. I got to tour with him in 2013 and he completely changed the way I looked at a live performance. The way that he engages with the audience and immerses himself in the crowd – it feels like church, it’s really magical. When I used to engage with audiences, it was more dialogue and banter. Then I stopped doing the jokey part and started to intentionally make eye contact with people. Then it evolved into the height of the set where I do Seventeen: the whole set I’m trying to think who upfront is the person who needs to hear this tonight, and I’ll pick someone out and will engage with them during that song as much as I can depending on the setup of the stage, and I’ll feel that energy and I’ll pull them in. That’s definitely something I took from Nick: choose when you do engage and do it really intentionally; you connect with that one person but it also affects everyone around them. Your song with Angel Olsen, Like I Used To, has become one of my desert island discs, and me and my mum frequently belt out the last high note in the car. Apart from Angel, who would be your dream collaborator? EmmasZygoticMynci So many. PJ Harvey, Sinéad O’Connor, Beth Gibbons. Geoff Barrow who works with Portishead, who is an amazing producer and drummer. Also I would love to work with Warren Ellis: he’s such a wizard and lives in so many different sonic universes. Like I Used To was such a joyous collaboration, both musically and visually. I remember you saying your mother always wanted you to write “happy songs”. Do you feel like she would be happy now? Kirmoblue Whenever my mom hears a song that sounds intense, she’ll be like: “I thought you were doing OK?” I have to explain all the time that when I write I’m going through a thing to get it out. I think she’s understanding that more and more. I’m nervous for her to hear the new record. But she’s also proud of what I do. I know she knows I’m OK even when I do struggle. Did playing Rachel on The OA have any effect on your music, lyrics or stage performance? I know your new album title, We’ve Been Going About This All Wrong, also appeared as a line in The OA, although I understand The OA wasn’t the actual inspiration for the title. anthonyfarthing I’m grateful to Netflix and [The OA co-creator and star] Brit Marling for having faith in the only non-actor who was part of the cast; it was my first time acting and I was terrified. I think if it affected my music at all, it’s just helped me dig deeper emotionally in my lyrics. I don’t remember that line being in the show and I don’t know if that has been embellished by others – but it’s definitely taken from the movie The Sandlot, where the kids are trying to get the baseball from the lot next door. It happens to be my son’s favourite movie and we watched it a million times over quarantine. There’s a scene where they make this contraption with a vacuum and it explodes in this kid’s face, and he looks at his friends and says, so deadpan: “We’ve been going about this all wrong.” In the height of Covid, clutching my son and my partner on the couch, feeling completely disconnected from the world, I teared up and wrote it down. There was something about that feeling of: every time we get through this one hump, something else fucking happens – there’s no end in sight. Sometimes you just have to do something differently to feel better. I first heard your music when your song Tarifa was on the Twin Peaks soundtrack (and in the show). What was it like working with David Lynch? KobayashiAndSon I still can’t believe I was part of that production: to say David Lynch is a legend is not doing him justice; he’s a visionary. I was really shy and quiet. It was very last minute: catch a red-eye from New York, find some place to have a coffee and wait around until you get the call. They were shooting all the artists back-to-back in the Roadhouse. David Lynch was sitting in his director’s chair with his megaphone, smoking, exactly how you think he would be. Such a gentleman, very specific in his directions. Your songs helped me get over a divorce! Are you more creative when sad or happy? Katkatjusa I tend to write whenever I’m feeling anything intensely, so that’s usually from a darker place. How I naturally work is: I’m feeling something intensely, I play and I sing stream-of-consciously and record for 10 minutes without making it about anything. I’ll listen back days, weeks, months later and try to understand what it was I was going through at the time. Ninety-nine per cent of what I do I don’t share: sometimes it is too dark and sometimes it just doesn’t make any sense. Epic was the first album of yours that I heard and it’s remained a favourite ever since. What made you decide to revisit it and release Epic Ten? Splazsh Funnily enough it was my partner, who is also my manager. He was like: “You’re coming up on an anniversary of Epic, that’s such a big deal, you should do something for it.” I was like: “Does anyone care? It feels like I’m tootin’ my own horn.” But the more I talked to people about it they were like: 10 years is a big deal, that’s a real mile marker for any artist. The album was remastered and then there were covers [of the original tracks] by some of my favourite artists, old and new. I’m so floored that they wanted to do it because it’s a lot to ask – for all of them to have made the time and made such beautiful versions, I’m still really dumbfounded. You joined Fountains of Wayne [for a tribute show] when Adam Schlesinger sadly died in the early days of the pandemic. I always thought they should have been a huge band as they wrote some sublime songs. Which other artist(s) do you think didn’t, or don’t currently, get the success they deserve? ArthurSternom I’m a Jersey kid so it meant a lot to be asked; we had a mutual friend in Sarah Silverman and lots of other mutual friends through people I work with. It was a challenge because I don’t play bass in front of people and I hadn’t ever done a livestream in that way. And it was emotional because it was mourning someone everyone in my circle admired so deeply. I never got to meet him, but everyone I knew spoke so highly of him. I have so many friends who I think have the best bands ever but nobody knows them: Forest Fire, Scary Mansion, Heron Oblivion. There’s a band from Chicago called Speck Mountain, they’re really incredible. I think there is a total randomness [to who makes it] sometimes. Bands that don’t want to tour, that’s a huge part of it; unfortunately you’re very reliant on touring to sell your records. I also think the artist has to be driven, no matter what. Some people lose their drive after a while, which is totally understandable because it’s exhausting. I’m in my 40s and I think I’m doing well but it’s still a constant battle. I feel like I have to put myself out there all the time. I’m in awe of your productivity. How do you manage so many different creative projects? laurasnapes Learning how to use a Google calendar and then setting parameters and goals and deadlines – I thrive on deadlines. Becoming a mother and having to work within schedules, you learn to maximise your time. [My son is] only in school for this long and when he’s home, I can’t do any of it; no offence to him, it’s just true. He needs my attention, he needs my partner’s attention. He’s an only child, and we want to be there for him. Every Time the Sun Comes Up is one of my all-time favourite album closers. Is it difficult to decide on songs’ positions in an album? peasywease Sequencing is so hard. There are songs that don’t make it because of the way I transition from one song to another. It’s like, song number eight has to be more upbeat and lighthearted after this really intense setup; there are two songs that could fill this role and I have to pick between the two. And it breaks my heart sometimes when songs don’t make the record because we use them later as B-sides and people assume that they’re fluff. So when I was planning the new [album] rollout I was like: I’m going to take songs that would be considered B-sides and release them ahead of the record so that people think something’s coming but I’m not giving anything away, either. Riesling might be my favourite grape, particularly German producers. Do you have a favourite? Gassy_Jack [Working as a sommelier] was my first job in New York, but I’m out of the game. I had to stop working in wine because I felt I was becoming more of a snob than just a wine drinker. And I’m trying to curb my drinking so I try not to have it around all the time – because I will drink a bottle. There’s two I really love, one is Pineau d’Aunis, a very light, very feminine, floral grape. The other one is Cab Franc, tends to be on the cleaner side, fairly affordable, sleek, peppery. They’re good with food, they’re not overpowering; they won’t stain your lips.

5/13/2022,"Magnus Carlsen has not competed on chess.com for more than a year, since the website is in direct competition with chess24.com, which is owned by the Play Magnus Group. So it was a shock when the world champion appeared unannounced on the starting line for this week’s Titled Tuesday, an 11-round blitz event with free entry to all internationally titled players. The Norwegian used 1 b3 and 2 Bb2 (Larsen Opening) in every game as White, and 1…b6 and 2…Bb7 (Owen Defence) in every game as Black. He still outclassed the field with 10/11, conceding just two draws and defeating world top-50 opponents Jeffery Xiong, Grigoriy Oparin and Parham Maghsoodloo. Meanwhile, the 31-year-old’s long-standing rival and popular streamer Hikaru Nakamura has released his thoughts on whether Carlsen will decline to defend his title against the winner of the eight-player Candidates scheduled for Madrid in June-July. Nakamura’s “no way!” conclusion is based principally on Carlsen’s need to do more to confirm his status as clear all-time No 1 ahead of Garry Kasparov. Alireza Firouzja, the youngest ever 2800-rated player at age 18 and favourite for the Candidates, took a five-month break from classical tournaments before returning as top seed in the elite Superbet Bucharest tournament which ends on Saturday. Bucharest is the first leg of the 2022 Grand Tour, which includes rapid/blitz tournaments in Warsaw and Zagreb before the Sinquefield Cup at St Louis in August. Asked about his absence, Firouzja replied that he had been “living the life and preparing for the Candidates”, but his results at Bucharest have been subdued. One win, one loss, 3.5/7, plus several errors and miscalculations. Next month in Madrid could be a different story. Wesley So and Levon Aronian were joint leaders in Bucharest with 4.5/7 two rounds rounds before the finish. So took a clear lead in round four with a neat tactic, while Aronian’s round-six miniature ended in a coup which is featured in this week’s puzzle. Wesley So v Ian Nepomniachtchi, Bucharest 2022. So is a pawn up, but with opposite coloured bishops it looks hard to win. What was So’s winning move? See puzzle solution below for the answer. There was a surprise in Richard Rapport v Leinier Domínguez when the Hungarian chose 1 e4 e5 2 Ne2?! (Alapin Opening) to avoid his opponent’s 2 Nf3 Nf6 Petroff, while Fabiano Caruana became the latest top player to use the Dilworth, a system worked out by a Cheshire railway clerk in the 1940s which still remains viable for both sides. India’s Dommaraju Gukesh, 15, winner of a trio of first prizes in Spain, and the USA’s Hans Niemann, 18, winner of the Capablanca Memorial in Havana and of last week’s Sigeman annual in Sweden, are the rising stars of the moment, with ratings fast approaching 2700. Next week’s Sharjah Open, with a large prize fund and at least 40 GMs rated above 2600, will test the new generation. Some feared for England’s long standing No 1, Michael Adams, when the 51-year-old had to take on both Niemann and Arjun Erigaisi, also 18, at Malmö, but Adams played a fine tournament, one of his best in recent years, with six steady draws then a final round victory which took him to shared second prize and featured a winning advance of Harry the h-pawn.In contrast the other veteran, Alexei Shirov, finished last. Many European cities have outside chess in parks and cafes, and London joined in on Thursday with chess tables in Russell Square Gardens. The popular all-day Chessfest in Trafalgar Square will also return on Sunday 17 July. 3815: 1...Na4! and the threat Rd8 mate gains decisive material. So v Nepomniachtchi: 1 Bxf7+! resigns. If Kxf7 2 Qc4+ and 3 Qxd4 or if Qxf7 2 Qg4+ and 3 Qxd4, when White, two pawns up with opposite coloured bishops exchanged, wins easily.",Sport/Sport,Chess: Carlsen wins Titled Tuesday while Alireza Firouzja is subdued,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/13/chess-carlsen-wins-titled-tuesday-while-alireza-firouzja-is-subdued
5/13/2022,"Our bin gets really smelly a few days into the week, but Abi refuses to empty it until it’s full My partner, Abi, refuses to take our bin out before Sundays. She’ll say, “No, we use only one bin bag a week, and we must wait until it’s full before it goes outside”. This habit really grinds my gears for a few reasons. First, the bin starts to smell really quickly. Even though we have a large bin with a lid, the stench of rotting garbage starts emanating from it halfway through the week. Who wants to deal with that? Second, the stinginess. Abi believes she’s being economical by waiting until the bin is full, but what is she really saving? Five, 10p a bag? I’m more than happy to give her the money for it if it means we don’t have to deal with the smell of the rubbish. For me it’s a no-brainer. Recently things got really smelly after we disposed of a lot of food waste and plastic containers that had had chicken breasts in them. I said, “I’m taking the bins out.” Abi tried to stop me. Her defence was, “The bin is barely full. You’re being wasteful.” But the smell was grossing me out. The bin is in the corner of the kitchen and I hate cooking when there is rotting rubbish right near me. Every time we opened it to put some more rubbish in, it would stink out the whole room. I argued that she was making us suffer for no reason. In the end, I took the old one outside, but she kept saying it was unnecessary. But in my mind you don’t have to wait until the bin is overflowing. If it smells, take it out. Abi is stingy about a lot of things. She never wants to throw away food and always insists on saving bits of leftover dinner, which we never eat. She also hates throwing out books and games she hasn’t touched in years. I think it’s how she was raised: to save every penny and never waste anything. But I’m more about personal happiness. If something is causing you stress, throw it out! There’s no doubt in my mind that I’m correct. If there is a putrid scent coming from the rubbish bin in your home, empty it. Abi needs to realise you can’t put a price on happiness – and foul smells make me very unhappy. It’s a total waste of money to use more than one bin bag a week, especially as the smell isn’t that bad The bins are a point of contention in our relationship. We got together three years ago and moved in with each other a year later. That’s when I began to notice that Chioma is a lot more wasteful than me. She will chuck milk out if it’s one day past the sell-by date. She doesn’t ever want to freeze leftovers. And with the kitchen bin, she’s determined to change it whenever there’s a slight smell. Any little inconvenience and it’s, “Oh, we have to change the bin again.” But in my opinion, there’s always going to be a bit of an odour when you keep rubbish inside the house. It’s normal. Chioma will be getting bin bags out several times a day, even when there’s no smell. I actually think she’s just scared of a possible odour, so she prematurely takes the bins out before there’s even a chance of it festering. I tell her, “You’re being a bit over the top. There’s not even anything in that bin,” but she just ignores me. We recycle cardboard and cans, but we don’t have a food waste bin so a lot of our leftovers go into the main bin. That probably adds to Chioma’s anxiety, but I never think it’s that bad. Also, our living room and dining area are separate, so if the smell is bad, we only ever have to endure it while we are in the kitchen. Our bin also has a sturdy lid. Chioma exaggerates when she says that it stinks every day. I’ve been raised to be a bit more conscientious about money. Chioma says I’m too frugal but I think it’s ridiculous to be going through multiple plastic bags a week when we could just use one. I’ve pretty much refused to take the kitchen bin out unless it is at capacity and it is a Sunday. Of course, I would make an exception if there was a really terrible smell, but that never happens. When Chioma complains about the bins, I remind her that the price of 50 black bin liners is £2.50 and rising. The cost of living is hitting us all hard. I don’t think I’m in the wrong here at all. Should Abi empty the kitchen bin more often? While there’s nothing wrong with waiting for a bin to be full before putting it out, food waste does smell. Some people are more sensitive to bad smells than others, and it seems Abi isn’t taking Chioma’s feelings into consideration.Eira, 52 Abi is hinting at a compromise – a separate food waste bin that can be disposed of every three or four days would eliminate smells. No need to throw refuse away every day, but as you prepare meals in the kitchen, the smells in that room shouldn’t put you off from entering it either.Tristan, 33 Abi is guilty: no one likes smelly rubbish in the kitchen. However, wasting food isn’t good and Chioma should be on board with Abi’s efforts in this area. A smaller bin/smaller bin bags might be a solution to both their needs.Jo, 56 Not only does the stench permeate furnishings and fabrics, it attracts flies and rodents, too. Abi needs to be more aware of Chioma’s sensitivity to smells, and commit to emptying the bins daily to have a pleasant-smelling home. How about buying a food recycling bin of their own?Chantal, 45 It’s hard to judge when the evidence seems to differ (is it several times a day, or once a week?) but I’m leaning towards the prosecution here. Smells, foul odours or the chance of festering all seem worth the 5p it costs to change the bag. Sorry Abi, you’re guilty!Ali, 33 So now you can be the judge. In our online poll below, tell us: should Abi take out the bin more often?We’ll share the results on next week’s You be the judge. The poll will close 19 May 9am BST We asked if Chris should soak the dishes before washing up, because his current method annoy his partner Penny. 90% of you said no – Chris is innocent10% of you said yes – Chris is guilty",Lifestyle/Life and style,You be the judge: should my partner take the bin out more often?,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/13/you-be-the-judge-should-my-partner-take-the-bin-out-more-often
5/13/2022,"It is eight years since Luton Town returned to the Football League, a title-winning campaign under John Still in which they racked up 101 points and rattled in 102 goals culminating at Hyde, and a look at the direction of the travel of the two teams helps paint the picture of a quite extraordinary rise. Hyde have just finished 18th in the Northern Premier League Premier Division, the seventh tier, while Luton are two games from a Championship playoff final and three from discovering the glitz of the Premier League, 30 years on from last tasting the top flight. The backbone of the club from those days in non-league remains, from the kit man, Darren Cook, to the goalkeeping coach, Kevin Dearden, the midfielder Pelly-Ruddock Mpanzu, the legendary chief recruitment officer and assistant manager, Mick Harford, the chairman, David Wilkinson, and the chief executive, Gary Sweet. A series of financial setbacks saw the club deducted 10 points in 2007-08 and a record 30 points by the Football League the following season after entering administration for the third time in nine years. The Championship was the aim when the club was bound for the fifth tier and the target spelled out in the name of the consortium that rescued the club: Luton Town 2020. They arrived at that destination a few months early, helped over the line by Harford after Nathan Jones, who returned as manager two years ago, left for Stoke. From that moment they have pushed to complete the set but they are way ahead of schedule. Sweet acknowledges there is “a comedy factor” around the prospect of the creaking and charismatic Kenilworth Road hosting Premier League matches. If they were promoted, much of the off-season would be spent making their stadium compliant. “The old girl hasn’t got much life left in her now but we dearly wish she can entertain top-flight football before she finally expires,” he says. “In the Conference, many thought I had lost my marbles when we spoke about the Premier League being our target. Why not? If you don’t reach for the top how do you know how far you’ve travelled?” Jones has a tight-knit bond with his players and a togetherness runs through the club. There is a determination to grasp their chance. “They always believed they would get back to the Championship,” says Still, who left the club midway through 2015-16, Jones his permanent successor. “I always felt they believed that was where they belonged. It is fantastic for the club, who felt they were wronged many years ago when they got bombed out of the league and I think responded in the only way you can respond, which is on the pitch. They could be sitting halfway down the league [Championship] and going: ‘Well, we’ve done the job we set out to do.’ But all of a sudden there’s a bigger thing tapping them on the shoulder and I’m not sure they would have believed they would be doing that.” Luton’s achievement is all the more remarkable given their modest resources. Their recruitment has been shrewd. They have a bottom-three budget smaller than some of the teams chugging along in League One, and their squad was assembled for less than £1.5m. Kal Naismith, Reece Burke, Jordan Clark and Gabriel Osho are among those who have thrived since arriving on frees. Elijah Adebayo, signed from Walsall last year, and Harry Cornick, who joined from Bournemouth in 2017, have impressed in attack. “Recruitment doesn’t start with the players, it starts with recruiting the right people to attract the right players,” Sweet says. “Nathan is clearly vital to this, and very good at it, but I’d argue that it’s the wider team of great people we have working in every office, every changing room, every kitchen and around every square inch of the club that attracted him back home. Our environment starts with the kit man and the maintenance guy or the team in the shop or ticket office. Without them, we’re nothing.” It is a similar story at Huddersfield, the visitors in the playoff first leg on Friday, whose squad cost about £2.3m. Both have defied the notion that financial muscle is the only way to compete. Mpanzu could make history by becoming the first player to represent the same club in every division from non-league to the Premier League. Dan Potts, who Still signed in League Two, also remains. “While other clubs trade in pounds as their only currency to gain points and silverware, we know that while it’s our desire to run a sustainable model, we can’t compete with that so we create different currencies that we believe are just as important as money,” Sweet says. The club is in rude health compared with the one the consortium of Luton supporters inherited in 2008. They hope to move into a new stadium, Power Court, in three years, with detailed plans set to be submitted to local planning officers. “It is every credit to everyone who stuck with the club through very dark days,” Still says. “They’re just poking their heads through now to find the proper sunshine of the Premier League. Whether they do it or not is immaterial. The progress they have made so far is brilliant and if it doesn’t happen this time, who’s to say it won’t happen next year? If they manage to do it and someone wrote a film about it, they’d say: ‘Mmm, yeah, that’s got to be fiction.’ It is fairytale stuff, isn’t it?”",Sport/Football,Luton Town: from non-league to the brink of a Premier League fairytale,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/13/luton-town-from-non-league-to-the-brink-of-a-premier-league-fairytale
5/13/2022,"Every day, for the past 20 years, Joyce Naserian has laid out her handmade curios near an entrance to the Masai Mara park to sell to passing tourists. Her earnings have helped the 46-year-old feed and educate all four of her children. In northern Kenya, about 1,200 semi-nomadic women earned more than 9m Kenyan shillings (£62,000) selling beadwork to visitors at 43 community wildlife conservancies in 2020. Just as it was Naserian in the Mara, selling the beadwork was a solid money earner for these women. But that was before Covid. The collapse of eco-tourism during the pandemic has spelled disaster for conservation initiatives and livelihoods in Kenya and beyond. Cuts to budgets and staff, reduced salaries and stalled development and education projects have plunged communities into poverty, leading to a rise in poaching and the illegal wildlife trade. Reuters reported that in the first three months of 2020, the African continent lost $55bn (£44bn) in travel and tourism revenues – funds that go towards running conservation programmes that benefit local communities. Kenya’s government has relaxed a raft of travel restrictions, but the return of international tourists has been slow, while concerns about carbon emissions from long-haul air travel may be putting people off flying into conservation areas. “It is a real struggle for survival,” says Daniel Sopia, head of Masai Mara Wildlife Conservancies Association. “Women who relied solely on beadwork were badly affected as there was not a single tourist coming to the Mara at the height of Covid-19 restrictions. Household income dropped significantly and they had to rely on food from well-wishers.” The 15 wildlife conservancies that Sopia heads comprise individual blocks of land owned by Maasai people. The landowners lease the land, covering 14,0426 hectares (347,000 acres), to safari camps and lodges, which pay fees that fund projects providing water, healthcare and education, as well as setting up small businesses. In return, the 14,500 landowners protect biodiversity within the Mara ecosystem while preserving their traditional lifestyle. Four years before the pandemic, the conservancies contributed almost 120m Kenyan shillings to social programmes in the region. Two years ago, payments to landowners fell by 50%, forcing conservancies to scale back operations and focus on priorities such as allowances to wildlife rangers. Sopia and his team had to scramble to prevent the total collapse of conservation programmes. “Conservancies remained operational throughout the pandemic despite the lack in tourism income,” says Sopia. “We were fortunate to mobilise some resources from development partners and private foundations. These helped to cover rangers’ salaries, food rations, fuel, and vehicle maintenance. “We hope the arrangement will be in place till June 2022 as we slowly wean the conservancies off such aid,” he says. Some foreign organisations are now making a comeback after a two-year hiatus. In March 2022, UK charity Tusk brought together conservation professionals from across Africa for a symposium in Masai Mara to help organisations diversify fundraising and build resilient units. Since 1990, Tusk has raised more than £80m towards conservation projects across more than 20 African countries and helped to protect more than 40 threatened species. Tusk’s upcoming Wildlife Ranger Challenge seeks to raise money for rangers whose pay was slashed in the pandemic. “The last two years have been extremely tough for everyone. The conservation sector in particular has had to endure huge losses, dramatic cutbacks in operating budgets, and, sadly, redundancies,” says Charlie Mayhew, Tusk Trust chief executive. Wanjiku Kinuthia, strategyhead at Maliasili, hopes the renewed interest in broadening discussions about African conservation will boost small organisations that are often left out of big decisions, despite being closest to the vulnerable communities bearing the brunt of a collapsing environment. “They often miss out on global dialogues,” says Kinuthia, whose group supports about 20 other organisations in seven countries, including smaller ones that lack the networks to make their voices heard. “They do not understand how the media works or how to tell their stories. We can be catalysts of change for such grassroots organisations.” Involving communities in conservation would safeguard the 65% of wildlife that lives outside protected areas, she says. “All people need are tools to help them coexist with animals in the 21st century while benefiting from conservation.” However, some conservationists say the only way to sustain conservation programmes and avoid disruption is by governments increasing budgets to the sector, a challenge considering the current low levels of state investment. Dickson Kaelo, who heads the Kenya Wildlife Conservancies Association, says African countries depend on foreign donors to fund development and conservation is no exception. “There is no single answer to cutting off foreign aid,” says Kaelo. “There are no government incentives for setting up a conservancy to protect an elephant that walks all over destroying life and property. “If you are in the farming sector, you can get a loan to buy a tractor, but there is no institution that gives loans for those who want to invest in protecting wildlife, and while a person buying a vehicle to ferry tourists gets some tax rebates, we get no such benefits when buying a truck for wildlife rangers.” He adds: “The government is creating laws that hamper conservation, including the Natural Resources (Benefits Sharing) Bill, with a formula that will see those in conservation give 80% of their proceeds to government and a paltry 12.8% to local communities. In addition, the government requires that you come up with a management plan, a strategic and environmental study, multiple registration procedures and other permits before setting up a private conservancy. If you want to lease land you have to pay 2% stamp duty for the entire period, say for 20 years, and pay that upfront. Why don’t we see such laws when someone wants to cut down a tree?” Kaddu Sebunya, chief executive at the African Wildlife Foundation says Africans must be exposed to the benefits of wildlife and wild lands so they can lead on conservation. A starting point would be to make tourism more accessible, he says, “as it is easier for someone in New York or Sydney to book a tour to Africa than someone living in Harare or Lagos.”. “Building our domestic and regional tourism market will be a stepping stone to increasing the African voice for conservation. While millions of Africans traverse the continent to travel for business, how can these numbers be translated to nature tourists? “Data from Unctad [UN Conference on Trade and Development] indicates that four out of 10 international tourists in Africa come from the continent, and this begs the question, ‘is our product marketing catering to the four Africans?’ It is high time for a shift in mindset,” says Sebunya.

5/13/2022,"It is 16 August 2020 and Alan Bennett and his partner are on their customary evening walk. Given that 86-year-old Bennett is hobbled with rheumatoid arthritis, this is hardly an ambitious excursion – literally three minutes “round the block” of their north London street. Suddenly the windows fly open and neighbours start banging pots and clapping. Since he needs to lean heavily on his walking stick, Bennett is unable to join in, but he compensates by standing in the street and nodding enthusiastically. Until, that is, the horrible thought strikes him that it must look as if he is acknowledging the applause, perhaps even trying to generate it himself. To disavow this, he tries shaking his head, “but this just looks like modesty”. It is a typical Bennett moment, part gentle social comedy part revelation about the self-delusions of the ego. It probably never occurred to the hollering neighbours that their joyful noise for the NHS might be misconstrued as directed at one elderly, slightly famous playwright. Bennett’s diaries, which he has been publishing since the early 1980s, are full of these “absurd and inexplicable” moments. The pandemic is the background and, indeed, the foreground to this latest and most slender tranche of journals, which runs to a mere 64 pages. The entries begin on 24 February 2020, with the diarist chipper about the unlikelihood of the new virus in Milan having much effect on London living, and chunter on to the autumn of 2021 when the crisis appears to be in the rearview mirror (we know, although he does not, that Omicron is lurking in the wings). The fact that Bennett’s new normal now involves being met by helpful staff with a wheelchair whenever he travels between Leeds and King’s Cross tells us just how frail he has become in the intervening 18 months. It doesn’t stop him, though, keeping a beady eye on the competition. In November 2020 he notices that the Queen, nearly 10 years his senior, is able to walk backwards when laying a wreath at the Cenotaph. The fact that Her Majesty could probably not manage this today is a reminder of how swiftly treacherous advanced old age can be. It is not all doom and gloom. On 26 March of that first year, Nicholas Hytner rings with the exciting news that the BBC would like to record a new version of Bennett’s Talking Heads monologues of 1988 because it is exactly the sort of thing that could be done on Zoom. The director pops round later that day to discuss details, which he is obliged to semaphore from the other side of the street. Bennett, in turn, worries that weeks of social isolation have robbed him of the power of speech. On the phone to the optician about his broken glasses, he finds that he has lost the words, and his partner has to take over. Later, arriving at the vaccination centre for his first jab, Bennett firmly announces that he is here “for the virus” (in his defence, he points out that both of them are “v words”). If Bennett’s speech can be jumbled, his writing remains as deft and seamless as ever, especially when dealing with that most numinous of subjects, his childhood in working-class Leeds. Contemplating the current regime of hand-washing and elbow-bumping pitches him straight back to the 1940s when the unfortunate family next door succumb to TB. Young Alan was strictly forbidden from setting foot in this den of contagion until, lured by Mrs Sherwood’s cloud-like yorkshire pudding, he decides to risk it: “It was as if I’d signed my own death warrant.” There is something about this early lesson in the danger that other people pose that contributes to the impression Alan Bennett always gives of having been primed for apartness. He recounts a telling anecdote from 1941 in which the whole family went on a Sunday fishing expedition in the country. Bennett and his brother wore their school caps, his mother her swagger coat, and his father the suit with the good trousers. Having failed to catch anything – were they even in the right place? – the unlikely sportsmen take themselves stoically home. “We never joined in, got the gear, looked the part,” recalls Bennett and it is clear that he is thinking of more than just fishing. Where this tortured restraint does not reach, though, is into Bennett’s ethical worldview which remain as richly communitarian as ever. The news that the cast and crew of the new Talking Heads series have agreed to take only a nominal fee and donate the profits to the NHS gives him a rare rush of pleasure in a world dominated by the bleak economics of Boris Johnson and Donald Trump. More than £1m is raised, an act of generosity that reaches far beyond the awkward performance of a Thursday night community clap.  House Arrest: Pandemic Diaries is published by Profile (£6.99).
