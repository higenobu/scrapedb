2/9/2022,"As more of us are considering heading abroad again, travel restrictions in a number of popular tourist destinations have been relaxed. France, Portugal and Greece have each updated their entry requirements for fully vaccinated travellers, with changes coming into effect in time for half-term.  Vaccinated tourists travelling to Portugal will no longer need to provide a negative test result to enter, although unvaccinated passengers will. Greece has also dropped pre-departure test requirements for fully vaccinated arrivals. However, as with many other EU states, it will require arrivals that have had their second jab more than 270 days ago to have had a booster. France also announced it would soon drop its requirement of a negative Covid test for vaccinated travellers from outside the EU, as daily infection numbers continue to fall. “We again required tests in December over the Omicron variant. In the coming days we will announce that tests are no longer needed for vaccinated people,” Europe minister Clément Beaune told France 2 television on Tuesday. Currently, anyone visiting France from outside the EU, including the UK, has to show a negative test result from the previous 48 hours, regardless of vaccination status. “This week there will probably be a new European protocol for vaccinated people arriving from outside the EU, with eased measures,” Beaune added. EU members agreed on 25 January to better coordinate their travel rules, in particular for people crossing borders within the bloc. The Omicron surge prompted Italy and Denmark, for example, to impose recent negative test requirements for entry by fellow EU residents as well as proof of vaccination, a tightening of the rules that irritated officials in Brussels. French authorities began lifting Covid restrictions this month, with nightclubs set to reopen from 16 February and standing areas once again authorised for concerts and sporting events as well as bars. Norway also eased restrictions, no longer asking travellers to test when they arrive in the country but requiring all travellers over the age of 16 to complete an online registration form 72 hours prior to arrival in Norway. Those who aren’t fully vaccinated must complete the online registration form and have proof of a negative Covid-19 test taken less than 24 hours before arrival. Meanwhile, Morocco has opened for the first time in 16 weeks and Australia also opened its border for fully vaccinated tourists and all visa holders from 21 February, almost two years after borders were first closed. However, travellers were warned to continue to double-check their half-term holiday plans to make sure they meet Covid vaccination rules when travelling to EU destinations. France joined Spain and Denmark last week in requiring anyone who completed their vaccination jabs more than 270 days ago to have a booster to enter the country – or be considered unvaccinated. Austria requires boosters after 180 days. People travelling to Italy, Croatia and Switzerland, as well as New York state or California, will not face the same border checks but may find it harder to go to restaurants, museums and other indoor venues if they have not been boosted.",Lifestyle/Travel,"France, Greece and Portugal relax Covid travel restrictions as half-term nears",https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/feb/08/france-greece-and-portugal-relax-covid-travel-restrictions-as-half-term-nears
2/9/2022,"The European Commission plans to withhold EU funds from Poland over an unpaid fine related to a coal mine dispute. In an unprecedented move the commission will cut Poland’s EU funds by €15m (£12.6) to recover money Warsaw has refused to pay the European court of justice.  Poland’s government was ordered by the ECJ to pay €500,000 a day for every day it defied an order to suspend lignite mining at the Turów coal mine. The Czech Republic brought the case, alleging that the open-pit mine near the Polish-Czech-German border broke EU environmental law, depleting groundwater supplies and causing dangerous levels of air and water pollution. The two countries settled the dispute last week, but EU officials say they had no choice but to deduct the unpaid fine from funds due to Poland. “When performing offsetting, the commission fulfils its legal obligation to collect financial penalties imposed by the court in accordance with its order of 20 September 2021,” said the commission spokesperson for budget, Balazs Ujvari. “In this regard, the commission follows the rules set out in the financial regulation, in the absence of payment by the member state.” The deduction covers unpaid fines from 20 September to 19 October 2021. The total fine amounts to around €70m and further cuts are expected to follow unless the sum is paid. A Polish government spokesman, Piotr Müller, told the Polish Press Agency that Poland would use “all possible legal measures to appeal against the plans of the European Commission, the more so that an agreement has been reached between the governments of Poland and the Czech Republic”. “This is particularly important in the context of the current geopolitical threats from Russia,” he said. Poland faces losing a further €100m over an unpaid fine of €1m per day for its refusal to abandon a disciplinary forum for judges. The dispute comes a day over Poland’s president, Andrzej Duda, met the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, in Brussels, where they discussed the Ukraine crisis. Von der Leyen said they had a “good exchange” on the security situation and Russia’s military build-up. “We also discussed the objective of having a robust judicial system in Poland, in line with EU standards,” she added. In an attempt to end the long conflict with Brussels over judicial standards, Duda announced last week he would dismantle the disciplinary chamber of Poland’s supreme court. While this is a key request for Brussels, it is not clear whether his new law will unwind political control of Poland’s judiciary, the root of the conflict with the EU.",News/World news,EU to withhold funds from Poland over unpaid fine ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/08/eu-to-withhold-funds-from-poland-over-unpaid-fine-coal-mine
2/9/2022,"This animated documentary from Danish film-maker Jonas Poher Rasmussen is an irresistibly moving and engrossing story, whose emotional implications we can see being absorbed into the minds of the director and his subject, almost in real time. Rasmussen’s elegant digital animation, interspersed with live-action archive TV footage, makes for a seamless link between the present and the remembered past and provides an ingenious way of obscuring the subject’s identity, which still has to be kept under wraps. Rasmussen talks to a friend of his from teen years, a gay Afghan man in Copenhagen, whom he names “Amin”, and who escaped from Kabul with what remained of his family after the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, his dissident father having been arrested and murdered in prison by mujahideen forces. Amin opens up about memories he has suppressed for decades: how his family went to Moscow on a tourist visa, which they outstayed, hiding in a rented flat; how his elder brother and two sisters were trafficked to Sweden on a container ship with inadequate food, water and air; and how he, with his mother, was forced to make a separate terrifying trip across Russia, and then board a tiny, leaky boat across the Baltic.  Amin was finally deported from an Estonian holding camp back to Moscow, and made a new, desperate attempt to reach Denmark, which meant surrendering himself at Copenhagen airport by claiming that all his family were dead – a lie that was vital to his being charitably accepted as an underage refugee orphan, and a lie which he tragically internalised almost all his adult life, because revealing the truth even now could complicate his Danish residency. It has created its own agonising survivor guilt, despite Amin being in touch with his family, themselves safe in Sweden. Then there is also the question of his gay identity, which is playfully disclosed with memories of his crush on Jean-Claude Van Damme – but interestingly, homophobia does not play a substantial part in this story. Anonymity means that, in journalistic terms, none of this can be verified. But there is no reason to doubt any of it, and the only thing I wondered was how much more heartwrenching detail the audience has been spared. What an extraordinary story.

2/9/2022,"Black business ownership is surging in the US despite the coronavirus pandemic and largely thanks to Black women, a new study found.  At the start of the pandemic, Black-owned businesses suffered. Between February and April 2020, Black business ownership dropped by more than 40%, the largest drop of any racial or ethnic group. When government aid became available, Black business owners received fewer small business grants than white business owners, with paycheck protection program funds only reaching 29% of Black applicants versus 60% of white ones. But according to the new study from Wells Fargo, Black business ownership is now up more than 30% on pre-pandemic levels, with Black women making up the fastest-growing group of female entrepreneurs as a record number of people start their own businesses. “At a time when folks are rethinking their lives and choices, it is not surprising that more Black women are electing to become CEOs of their own companies rather than waiting for their intelligence and skills to be recognized at their current firms,” Melissa Bradley, founder of 1863 Ventures, an agency for Black and brown entrepreneurs, told Business Insider. Pandemic layoffs could be another factor in the rise of Black business ownership. Job insecurity caused by Covid-related restrictions prompted many people to explore alternative options, including starting businesses. Diamonte Walker, deputy executive director of the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh, told the Pittsburg Post-Gazette: “Being beholden to corporations and institutions just doesn’t feel like a safe bet in times of uncertainty, whereas the risk of starting a business now starts to feel a lot less than the risk of sitting on a job not knowing when your number is coming up.” Experts say the emergence of female Black business owners could be explained by Black women wanting more control over their work life. Millions left their jobs during the pandemic due to inadequate pay, lack of childcare options and debates about remote work, all compounded by systematically low pay and workplace discrimination. “If you start your own business, some of those obstacles may not be as acute as if you were relying on employment from someone else,” the Wells Fargo chief economist, Jay H Bryson, told Insider. “There may be avenues that certainly benefit anybody, but proportionally they’d be more beneficial to the Black community than other parts of the population.”",News/US news,"US Black business ownership sees rise thanks to women, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/08/us-black-business-ownership-sees-rise-women-study
2/9/2022,"The EU is being urged to stop punishing scientists and end the year-long delay in letting British universities and laboratories access its flagship £10bn Horizon Europe funding programme. Scientists across the UK and Europe have launched a campaign to get the UK admitted into the programme amid continuing fears that Brussels is using the fund as leverage in negotiations over the Northern Ireland protocol.  The EU agreed to associate membership for the UK as part of the wider Brexit trade deal struck on Christmas Eve 2020 but it has still not ratified the deal or a similar one with Switzerland, held up by a dispute over a draft treaty binding the country to the bloc. The Swiss astronomer and Nobel prize winner Didier Queloz described the delays as a tragedy for science in the UK, Switzerland and Europe. Lord Kinnoull, the chair of the House of Lords European affairs committee, which has recently investigated the impact of the delay, said: “This is a mutual self-harm problem. And that’s not good for something very precious, which is European scientific research. “Last week we had two British academics and a European academic in front of us and there was a great clarity from all of them about how this was harmful to European science. Collaborative projects are much more than just a cheque … if you say you have a half-funded project you are very keen to do, you are not necessarily going to get the thumbs-up.” Queloz, who is backing a Europe-wide campaign by scientists across the bloc to get membership ratified for the UK and Switzerland, said: “To be blunt, politicians have decided to use participation in Horizon Europe as a bargaining chip in wider negotiations.” He wrote in the Financial Times: “If this is the way the game plays out, everybody loses. We risk destroying a fantastic tool that the EU has spent decades developing by excluding two of the biggest players in the global research arena for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with the programme itself.” Scientists say the days of solo science are long gone, with collaboration responsible for success in everything from the development of Covid vaccines to Queloz’s discovery of a new extrasolar planet. Queloz urged politicians to “pause for a moment” and consider the damage they were doing. “As a scientist holding posts at the universities of Cambridge and Geneva, I recognise that I am conflicted. But, approaching 60, this decision won’t affect my career very much. I am not batting for myself, I’m batting for the future generation of scientists who will be held back by this failure of politics. If the UK and Switzerland walk away, the Horizon budget will be lower; there will be fewer opportunities for young talent to spend time in our great universities,” he said. Ludovic Thilly, the chair of the executive board of the Coimbra group of 41 universities across Europe, said: “We cannot accept any longer that scientific cooperation be held hostage to bilateral politics. A decade of cooperation with our British and Swiss partners is at risk of being jeopardised, and this at a period of time when global challenges have never required so much international research cooperation.”",News/Politics,UK and European scientists urge EU to allow UK access to £10bn fund,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/08/uk-and-european-scientists-urge-eu-to-allow-uk-access-to-10bn-fund-brexit
2/9/2022,"A new professorship in the history of sexualities is to be established at the University of Oxford, after a £5m donation in memory of the human rights lawyer and LGBTQ+ activist Jonathan Cooper who died last year. The new chair will expand the teaching and research into LGBTQ+ history carried out at Oxford and will be the first fully endowed post of its type in the UK when it launches in 2023.  The university said the professorship “will act as a catalyst for developing scholarship in LGBTQ+ history at Oxford and also enable it to develop an interrelated series of courses to enhance the student experience, while attracting applicants who may not have considered pursuing study at Oxford before”. Lyndal Roper, the university’s regius professor of history, said: “LGBTQ+ history is where some of the most vibrant historical research and writing is now happening and the creation of the Jonathan Cooper chair of the history of sexualities is an important milestone for the field. The coming generation is questioning what gender means, and now is the time to establish this exciting new scholarship.” Funding for the endowment came from donations by Lisbet Rausing and Peter Baldwin, academics and co-founders of the Arcadia Fund, a grant-making charity that has donated millions of pounds to organisations working on human and natural diversity. Rausing is the daughter of Hans Rausing, the Tetra-Pak billionaire. The professorship will be based at Mansfield College, whose principal, Helen Mountfield, said: “It is my firm aim that this will be the start of an exciting research cluster exploring the histories and contributions of LGBTQ+ people. As a historian, in the nonconformist college, I am delighted to help widen the stories which are recorded and valued. As a lawyer, and a friend of Jonathan Cooper, I am proud that his enduring contribution to the history of LGBTQ+ emancipation will be recognised and celebrated by the post named in his memory.” Cooper died suddenly in September last year. He was renowned for his work on international human rights law, and as an advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and a commentator on issues such as trans rights, conversion practices and the rights of people living with HIV. Kevin Childs, Cooper’s partner, said Cooper’s first love had been history: “If there’d been space in his life for him to be anything else he would have been an historian. So, it is particularly fitting that this first chair in the history of sexualities is named after him, for it acknowledges his passion and love as much as his reputation.” Mansfield College plans to continue fundraising to establish a research cluster around the chair, to “spark debate and nurture new scholars”. It wants to support the post with fully funded graduate scholarships in LGBTQ+ history research.",News/Education,New Oxford history of sexualities role named after LGBTQ+ activist,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/08/oxford-history-sexualities-professorship-lgbtq-activist-jonathan-cooper
2/9/2022,"What the truck is going on in Canada? No offence to Ottawa, but it’s not the most exciting place in the world. Over the past couple of weeks, however, the Canadian capital has been embroiled in drama: hundreds of truckers, ostensibly protesting against vaccine mandates, have brought the city to a standstill. Members of the so-called “Freedom Truck Convoy” have been blaring horns, desecrating war memorials and setting off fireworks. Residents are being driven to distraction. The police chief has called the situation a “siege”; the Ontario premier called it “an occupation”. On Monday, the city’s mayor, Jim Watson, declared a state of emergency. There’s a lot going on in the world right now. If you’re not Canadian, then the protest in Ottawa might not be top of your list of things to worry about. But I’m afraid you should be worried. You should certainly be paying attention. What’s unfolding in Ottawa is not a grassroots protest that has spontaneously erupted out of the frustration of local lorry drivers. Rather, it’s an astroturfed movement – one that creates an impression of widespread grassroots support where little exists – funded by a global network of highly organised far-right groups and amplified by Facebook’s misinformation machine. The drama may be centred in Canada, but what is unfolding has repercussions for us all.  That’s a big claim, so let me break it down. We’ll start with the Canadian lorry drivers. The people protesting against vaccine mandates, it can’t be stressed enough, are by no means representative of the Canadian haulage industry as a whole. Just 10% of cross-border drivers refused the jabs, according to the Canadian Trucking Alliance (CTA), meaning that from 15 January they can no longer cross back into Canada without quarantine. The CTA, along with other major industry organisations, has disavowed the protest. The protesters don’t represent the vast majority of lorry drivers, nor are they representative of public sentiment towards vaccines in Canada – a country where 84% of the population, children included, have received at least one vaccine dose. They are, as Justin Trudeau has said, a “small fringe”. They may be a fringe minority, but that doesn’t mean you should (as Trudeau seems to be doing) downplay or dismiss them. For one, they have a lot of powerful supporters. The usual crowd of rightwing politicians in the US, including Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, have been cheering them on. They have also been getting millions of dollars in funding across crowdfunding sites from international donors. “Donations from abroad are quite a common part of any large crowdfunding campaign,” Ciaran O’Connor, an expert on online extremism at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, told Politico. “But the scale of this one is unprecedented.” Another reason why you should take the Ottawa protests seriously? Thanks to the wonders of modern technology, fringe groups can have an outsize influence. I’m sure you’ve heard of troll farms: organised groups that weaponise social media to spread misinformation, promote division and influence public opinion. Get this: in the long run-up to the 2020 US elections, Facebook’s most popular pages for Christian and Black American content were being run by eastern European troll farms. According to an internal Facebook report written in late 2019 and leaked to MIT Technology Review, troll farms were reaching 140 million users every month. Three-quarters of these users had never followed any of the pages: they’d had the content thrust upon them by Facebook’s engagement-hungry content-recommendation system. “Our platform has given the largest voice in the African American community to a handful of bad actors, who, based on their media production practices, have never had an interaction with an African American,” wrote the report’s author, a former senior-level data scientist at Facebook. “Instead of users choosing to receive content from these actors, it is our platform that is choosing to give [these troll farms] an enormous reach.” After that report was leaked in September, Facebook made a lot of noises about how it was aggressively cracking down on troll farms. Has it followed through on these promises? Meta Platforms, Facebook’s owner, said on Monday that it had removed dozens of scam pages associated with the convoy protest from Facebook; however, there are still a huge number of recently created pages supporting the hauliers, with suspiciously large numbers of followers. Meanwhile, on Telegram, a social network favoured by the right, people across the world are urging each other to replicate the tactics in Canada in their home towns. Canada may not be on the brink of civil war, but what is happening in Ottawa is one small front in a global information war. And the baddies, I’m afraid to say, are winning.

2/9/2022,"Uber has swung its weight behind proposals from the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, for more road charges, as it unveiled plans to expand zero-emission cab services. The ride-hailing firm said it had more than doubled the number of electric vehicles (EVs) on its app in London to 5,000 in the last year, which will allow it to widen out its Uber Green service – where users can request only EV drivers – from the city centre to cover the whole of Greater London in the spring.  Uber’s UK boss said that its growth in EVs was in part down to the “strong leadership” of the mayor and said the firm “absolutely supported” Khan in planning to levy more charges to ease congestion and pollution. Jamie Heywood, Uber’s general manager for northern and eastern Europe, said the firm had committed to be fully electric in the capital by 2025, adding: “The reason we were able to do that is because of the strong leadership the mayor has shown in electrifying London and trying to manage things like congestion and pollution. “We’ve spent a lot of the last four years leaning in to join with the momentum the mayor has created to support our drivers.” Uber’s London licence comes up for renewal in March. It won an 18-month extension on appeal in 2020, after Transport for London initially rejected its application due to safety concerns. Uber introduced a clean air fee in 2018 that added 15p a mile to London journeys – now totalling a £145m pot, giving the average driver more than £3,000 in an individual savings account to redeem against the purchase of an electric car. Heywood said the fund was at a “tipping point” from saving to spending, with only £9m so far spent but most drivers having saved enough to incentivise buying electric. About 90% of new registrations of Uber vehicles in London are now fully electric, he said. The firm has negotiated discounts with manufacturers including Nissan, Hyundai and Tesla, as well as banks and lenders to help Uber drivers access finance. Heywood said it was on track for 10,000 EVs in London by the end of the year, more than any other global city, and had committed to be fully electric in the capital five years earlier than in its other markets. Heywood said it owed much to the congestion charge and push for more electric charging points, and “other tools to work out how to keep London a clean, great, low congestion city”. Khan last month said he would seek to extend charges for drivers of all but the cleanest vehicles by 2024, enlarge the ultra low emission zone and develop a long-term road pricing scheme. Heywood said: “It’s admirable that the the mayor has called for a consultation on what are the bold steps that need to be taken – we absolutely support having that conversation. It’s important that behaviours that cause pollution and congestion – which are big social costs – are disincentivised.” He said road charging “could play a very important part in trying to move urban transport from being [private] car-dominated into one that is shared – be that Uber Pool or public transport – or much more active, biking and walking”. But he said it would be important it was designed in a way that “doesn’t worsen London’s inequalities”.",News/Technology,Uber backs Sadiq Khan’s road-charging proposals for London,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/08/uber-backs-sadiq-khans-road-charging-proposals-for-london
2/9/2022,"When I call my dog, she comes automatically. It’s a compulsion activated by dopamine, a chemical that ignites the brain’s pleasure centers with anticipation, the possibility of some reward. In Sex and the City, it was the possibility that Mr Big might finally commit that kept an obedient Carrie Bradshaw running back for six consecutive seasons. The euphoric rush of dopamine lies at the heart of compulsive behaviors like these, sending dogs faithfully back to their owners, and otherwise intelligent women into the arms of emotionally unavailable financiers. It’s the science behind watching a television show you categorically dislike, solely for the possibility that maybe, eventually, you’ll get a good episode.  We’re talking about And Just Like That, the SATC reboot that, over the last 10 weeks, might have delivered two, maybe three good episodes tops. Audiences spent the majority of its run voicing outrage at the misadventures of Miranda Hobbes, the abandoned plotlines and abrupt character reversals, and most of all, the implausible dialogue of “Miranda! I’ve done a ton of weed.” Despite their disappointment, however, viewers couldn’t stop tuning in. The reboot represented a former great love that they were committed to rekindling, and every so often, the spark would resurface. The joys and razor-sharp dialogue of the original series appeared in glimmers of Miranda’s familiar feminist realism (see: her refusal to insult Natasha’s flats, or her distaste for Carrie’s belief in the afterlife); Carrie’s enduring, neurotic obsession with Natasha; the trio’s chemistry at every meal; or a newly important question: are you a hollower or a sagger? In our collective inability to look away, And Just Like That became HBO Max’s most-watched original ever, bringing about the possibility of a second season. Would we watch it? Absolutely – Carrie Bradshaw’s greatest lesson was that we should wait out our toxic relationships and assume that they’ll improve. A second season would be our shot to really make things work, and right this season’s many, many wrongs. Below is a shortlist of recommendations. After 10 episodes, all we’ve really seen of Lisa Todd Wexley is her art collection and Moschino jacket. While Charlotte’s new friend adds to the show’s diversity, thus far she’s shown little of her personality, a reversal of SATC’s character-driven formula. In the original series, four white, more or less straight, women resonated with fans on a universal level, representing traits that we explicitly recognized within ourselves. You could be a Carrie, a bubbly, self-centered optimist, or a Samantha, a sexual iconoclast. Today, I can’t help but wonder, what would it mean to be a Lisa? For diversity and relatability to thrive in the second season, AJLT needs to take better care of its Black and brown characters, whose screen time gets wasted on sentimental lessons in diversity. (Seema Patel actually unironically says: “It’s not cultural appropriation, it’s cultural appreciation.”) Reinvest that time in developing their stories; give them identities rather than labels; and relieve them of their teaching duties. In episode four, Charlotte makes the error of confusing one Black woman for another. “I’m not Gwen,” she responds politely, “but I know who you’re talking about.” What a succinct, lacerating sting. With 10 words, it speaks volumes about the patience with which women of color handle white women’s egos, and how easily white women’s egos will crumble – visibly, a piece of Charlotte dies inside. It’s the smartest depiction of racial dynamics on the show, and Charlotte’s realest moment all season. Please, give us more of these! The original series’ HBO-caliber dialogue has noticeably atrophied to ABC Family sentimentality, particularly with Charlotte, whose life is otherwise one-dimensional conflicts with two-dimensional characters. She would benefit from a more truly challenging narrative arc, less pouting and teaching her children to knock. “We can’t stay who we were,” Miranda says in the first episode, setting the tone of AJLT’s wild experiment with the SATC canon. Her midlife spiral reads like a work of fan fiction, where the infinitely meme-able Che Diaz sweeps her off her feet. (It was inevitable that Miranda would leave Steve, however. She was Steve’s Big all along.) An amalgam of contradictions, Che Diaz is a comic with no jokes but a pilot on Netflix, a celebrity with a huge following but zero friends. Radiating with the fuckboy energy of a young Big, they tell Miranda unequivocally “I can’t give you anything traditional” yet, and there they were, introducing her to their grandparents within the first season. Enough already! The chaotic energy of this couple is more than this audience can stand. Every episode, we’re riddled with the anxiety that Che is finally going to break Miranda’s heart, only to get another stay of execution. Next season, leave Che in California and bring Miranda home. While Miranda changed too much and Charlotte changed too little, Carrie is proof that showrunners are capable of getting a character just right. She rings true to the original Carrie, only with a decidedly subdued effervescence and more advanced sense of entitlement; she tells Charlotte to shut up more than ever, and even after his death, upholds her lifelong devotion to Big. This is the template of realistic ageing for showrunners to follow next season, when they hopefully cure Miranda’s stunning reversal in character, and fortify Charlotte with the confidence to confront Carrie’s bullying. For all its emphasis on positive representation, AJLT really treats mid-life with derision. Leigh Raiford, a UC Berkeley professor, describes the construct perfectly: “Three white ladies go on vacation to the exotic locale of 2022,” not unlike their clueless trip to Abu Dhabi in 2010. Carrie, Charlotte and Miranda seem to visit us from some foreign time and place, where 55 is the new 80, podcasts are a novelty, and no one watches standup – no, they go to comedy concerts. “That’s what your mom would call it!” the AJLT writers explained in a recent interview, only to highlight the underlying ageism of this show; these are Gen Xers telling boomer jokes written by millennials. Rather than punish Carrie, Charlotte, Samantha and Miranda for the tone-deafness of the early aughts, it would be infinitely more compelling to meet versions of them who had evolved offscreen with the rest of us. Imagine a New York-based, fashion-forward iteration of the Golden Girls, whose central focus was rarely on “getting old” but the broader concerns of loyalty, intimacy and friendship. They could also tell good jokes and have good sex. Rose Nylund has more sex in her first three episodes than Carrie Bradshaw has all season. In the finale, when Carrie started kissing the hot producer who said two lines nine episodes ago – did anyone catch his name? In AJLT, major developments tend to come out of nowhere, friendships form overnight, and storylines are established just to be abandoned. I swore Miranda was on her way to Cleveland to see Che, but then again, it was never shown and never acknowledged. The narrative arcs would benefit from more rigorous construction; SATC truly excelled at growing chemistry between characters and furthering the plot, taking its audience on the full rollercoaster of exposition, tension and climax. Unhampered by menopause, children, or monogamy, Anthony might be the sole character who maintains the same energy he had 20 years ago.

2/9/2022,"It was a Singaporean news report on the Winter Olympics opening ceremony, live from a Beijing bar filled with eager fans. Yet it was two men – who burst into the view of the camera, sharing a dramatic kiss – who stole the show. The clip has since gone viral in Singapore, where broadcasting codes restrict content that promotes LGBT “lifestyles”, and where sexual relationships between men are outlawed.  This article includes content provided by TikTok. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. The kiss does not feature in a version of the report published by Channel News Asia (CNA) on its website. But on TikTok a clip of the kiss has been viewed more than 825,000 times. “This is actually an act of revolution,” one user wrote. It has also been shared widely on Weibo, a popular social media platform in China. It is the look given by one of the men, who poses directly to camera post-kiss, that has caught many people’s attention, said a representative of Kaleidoscope NTU, a group formed by students at Nanyang Technological university to raise awareness of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, as well as gender, race and class. “We don’t know who this guy is, of course, so we don’t know if he knew they were kissing for CNA specifically or just a camera in general. But the defiance of it, the joy that comes with being able to show off your partner and the confidence in getting to be yourself as well, the combination would have naturally spoken to a lot of queer people within the country as well,” they said. China decriminalised same-sex relationships in 1997, but same-sex marriage is not legal there and the LGBTQ+ community continues to face discrimination and censorship. Activists say the clip, and the reaction it has provoked, illustrates how outdated Singapore’s laws are. “Singapore is considered a developed country, but we are really backwards when it comes to LGBT rights,” said Jean Chong, a co-founder of Sayoni, an LGBT rights organisation. Guidelines from Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority for free-to-air and subscription television state that films that“depict alternative sexualities, eg, homosexuality, should be sensitive to community values”, and that films that promote homosexuality will be denied classification. A content code for free-to-air radio services lists LGBT content alongside “paedophilia and incest”, stating that programmes referring to such “lifestyles” should be treated with utmost caution. “Their treatment should not in any way promote, justify or encourage such lifestyles,” it states. Speeches by high-profile figures have been censored under broadcasting rules, including Barack Obama’s 2016 appearance on the Ellen DeGeneres Show, in which he praised the host as a role model. Benjamin Xue, a co-founder of the LGBT youth support group Young Out Here, said such censorship failed to control the media consumed by younger generations. Instead of tuning into free-to-air TV, young people were watching YouTube and online streaming services. Attitudes among young people had changed significantly in the 15 years that Young Out Here has operated, he added. “They are coming out a lot younger these days and are a lot more sure about their identity – especially trans and non-binary young people,” Xue said. Yet the gap between online media and local television, which is consumed by older generations, risked contributing to a growing divide in opinions. “Their parents, their grandparents and the rest of society are not viewing the same lens,” Xue said.",News/World news,Gay kiss on live TV evades Singapore’s ban on LGBT content,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/08/gay-kiss-live-tv-evade-singapore-ban-lgbt-content-channel-news-asia-beijing-bar
2/9/2022,"Name: The croissant dress. Age: Three.  Appearance: Well, a croissant. I don’t know what you’re talking about. Not a Sex and the City fan then, eh? Good Lord, is that still going? Not really. The series ran until 2004, and then it was followed by two films, and now there is the spin-off series And Just Like That. OK, and what does this have to do with croissants? In the final episode of And Just Like That, Carrie Bradshaw, played by Sarah Jessica Parker, wore a dress that looked a bit like a croissant. Why? She was in Paris. Makes sense. In fairness, she didn’t deliberately try to dress up like a croissant. That would be pathologically stupid. Instead, she chose to mark the climactic moments of the series by wearing a spring/summer 2019 Valentino couture gown. It just happened to look like a croissant. Definitely wasn’t deliberate, then? No, absolutely not. Only the worst kind of berserk tourist would visit a country and adopt its iconography as fashion. Carrie Bradshaw isn’t that stupid. Although … Although what? Although she was also holding a handbag shaped like the Eiffel Tower. I take it all back. Maybe this is the start of a trend. Maybe the trend already exists. Cast your mind back to the 2015 Met Gala, when Rihanna rocked up in a yellow dress with a huge circular train that the internet quickly decided looked like an omelette, or a pizza? No. Well, it happened. And this sort of thing happens so much that a Thai clothing store owner named Sine Benjaphorn will often recreate celebrity dresses out of food. Most notoriously, she once recreated a Rihanna dress out of nothing but sliced ham. I wonder what she’d make Carrie Bradshaw’s dress out of. A croissant, obviously. A really big croissant. Because that’s what the dress looks like. And Just Like That must be pretty embarrassed that this is all it will be remembered for. On the contrary, the show has suffered through several catastrophes during its brief run. Its first episode crashed Peloton’s stock price, for instance, and the show has suffered constant criticism for its clumsy attempts at wokeness. Plus there’s still the lingering void left by Kim Cattrall’s absence to worry about. That’s a lot of stuff for one show. It is. And Just Like That has proved to be one of the most divisive on television. So why is the internet talking about a dress? Look, it’s the internet. Why does it do anything? Do say: “Carrie Bradshaw went to Paris and wore a dress that looks like a croissant.” Don’t say: “Next season she’ll come to the UK and wear a dress that looks like a £3 Tesco meal deal.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,The croissant dress: will we develop a taste for food-themed couture?,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/feb/08/the-croissant-dress-will-we-develop-a-taste-for-food-themed-couture
