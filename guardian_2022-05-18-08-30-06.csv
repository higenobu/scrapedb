5/18/2022,"Noel Gallagher’s guitar that was damaged backstage at an Oasis concert and culminated in the band breaking up has sold for €385,500 (£325,000) at an auction in Paris. The red Gibson was broken at the French capital’s Rock en Seine festival in 2009 towards the end of the band’s year-long Dig Out Your Soul global tour. Jonathan Berg, a guitar expert and co-founder of the Artpèges gallery that held the auction, said the instrument marked “a cult moment” in music history. The band had been slated to play at the festival but the crowd were famously told that they would not be appearing. Noel later announced he was leaving the band, saying he could no longer work with his brother Liam. Berg said: “Things had been brewing for a while between the two brothers.” He added: “It exploded backstage, one of Noel’s guitars got broken and that led to the group breaking up.” With a starting price at €150,000, the auctioneers estimated bids for the guitar could have reached as high as €500,000. The guitar, restored in 2011, was presented with its original case and a note from its former owner signed “Peace, love and bananas”. Arthur Perault, another co-founder of Artpèges, said he was “pretty happy” with the auction at the Hôtel Drouot. Among the other lots was a bondage suit made of leather and chains worn by Martin Gore from the British group Depeche Mode, which was bought for €15,528.

5/18/2022,"Nottingham Forest have said they are “appalled” after the Sheffield United striker Billy Sharp was “assaulted” by a fan during the post-match celebrations after their side won in the Championship play-off semi final. The fan, a man dressed in a yellow top and blue trousers, is seen in television pictures headbutting Sharp, who was on loan at Forest from Southampton during the 2012-13 season, as he watches the celebrations from the touchline. As Sharp lays on the floor, the man sprints away from the scene. The Sheffield United manager Paul Heckingbottom told Sky Sports: “There’s a prison sentence there for sure. We’re seeing things thrown on the pitch and things that are thrown on putting players’ health and safety in danger and nothing’s ever done about it. There will be something done about that. We’ve seen what’s happened, we know what’s happened. “How can you come to a place of work minding your own business and be assaulted in that fashion? It’s just bang out of order and it’s everything that’s wrong. Too many times we hear people condemn it, but nothing’s done about it. We’re the ones that suffered. “It’s assault. We’ve seen one of our players attacked. He’s shuck up, bleeding, angry. It’ll be dealt with. “It’s upsetting for a lot of reasons - I don’t want to say too much more about it.

5/18/2022,"The business department’s handling of Covid support schemes left an “open goal” to fraudsters and embezzlers that has added “billions to taxpayer woes”, parliament’s spending watchdog has found. In its review of the annual report of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said it recognised that the government offered crucial support to businesses at the height of the pandemic. However, it said efforts to identify fraud and error had come too late, given that by the time they are confirmed the money will have been spent and “trails will have long ago gone cold”. “BEIS says it saw this risk coming but it’s really not clear where government was looking when it set up its initial Covid response,” said the PAC’s chair, the Labour MP Dame Meg Hillier. “It offered an open goal to fraudsters and embezzlers and they have cashed in, adding billions and billions to taxpayer woes. These lessons should have been learned from the banking crisis a decade ago, and could have been prepared in the government’s pandemic exercises.” The comments come amid frustration over the extent of Covid fraud that has put billions of pounds worth of government cash at risk. Of the £79.3bn worth of loans guaranteed by the government to support businesses during the first year of the pandemic, it is estimated that taxpayers will lose about £4.9bn to fraud and error. That is on top of a further £5.7bn, which is estimated to have been lost within the furlough and self-employment programmes. The report accused BEIS of failing to sufficiently identify or reflect the potential risks from organised economic crime. “Some of its eye-watering losses only represent the department’s best estimates so far, so the actual amount of taxpayer’s money that will be lost could be even higher,” the PAC said, noting there was also limited information about the true level of fraud related to the £21.8bn worth of Covid grants, which were distributed by local authorities. BEIS has only estimated fraud and error levels related to £11.5bn of those grants, at about £1bn, the PAC said. A government spokesperson said: “We’re continuing to crack down on Covid support scheme fraud and will not tolerate those who seek to defraud consumers and taxpayers. “These schemes were implemented at unprecedented speed to protect millions of jobs and businesses. If the government didn’t move quickly, more businesses would have failed and many more jobs lost.” ",News/Society,"Covid support schemes left ‘open goal’ to fraudsters, says watchdog",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/18/covid-support-schemes-left-open-goal-to-fraudsters-says-watchdog
5/18/2022,"The youngest children have been most affected by lockdowns and closures during the Covid pandemic, with new research finding that the educational progress and social development of four- and five-year-olds suffered severely during their first year at school. Aggressive behaviour such as biting and hitting, feelings of struggling in class or being overwhelmed around large groups of children were among the difficulties reported by teachers during interviews. Claudine Bowyer-Crane, of the National Institute for Economic and Social Research, said the findings were worrying: “Not only does it suggest that children who started reception in 2020 are struggling in the specific learning areas of literacy and maths but also that a smaller proportion of these children are achieving a good level of development.” The research – published by the Education Endowment Foundation – found parents and teachers concerned that children in England were struggling with their emotional wellbeing as well as their ability to learn language and numeracy skills, after starting in reception classes after the earlier spring lockdown. “For many children the experience of lockdown was made harder by cramped living conditions, no access to green spaces, parental mental health difficulties and financial hardship. On starting school, they had to contend with the disruption caused by Covid-19 restrictions only to then go back into another lockdown after just one term of schooling,” the researchers concluded. Teachers who spoke to the researchers said the disruption had left some infants with “low self-esteem and confidence”, and that more children than previously “feel overwhelmed” by learning. Others highlighted increased behaviour problems seen when children returned to school, with some “biting, hitting, unable to share”, leading to teachers having to focus more on helping children settle back into school. Ruth Coleman, headteacher at Highfield school in Ipswich, said: “When children returned to our nursery after the pandemic, many struggled with vital aspects of early years development, such as personal touch, or coping in bigger groups of children. “We saw more children who had separation anxiety from their parents too. Some children were further behind with speech and language development than we’d expect.” The study looked at more than 3,000 children who began their reception year in September 2020, with their school year disrupted by the second lockdown in November 2020 and the third in January to March 2021. Many of those children had previously missed out attending daycare or other early years settings during the March 2020 lockdown. Teachers reported that some parents were unable to help their children learn during the lockdowns, finding it difficult to teach reading and writing. “Some parents were very difficult to engage and maybe we should have tried harder to get those children into school as they are now significantly behind,” one teacher commented. The study found that more children finished reception year behind in their expected goals than in pre-pandemic years, with the equivalent of three fewer children in every classroom not reaching expected levels of academic, personal and physical development. Prof Becky Francis, the chief executive of the EEF, said: “The early years are such a crucial time for children’s development, both in terms of their attainment outcomes and their social and emotional wellbeing. So it is particularly concerning that fewer children reached the expected levels of development by the end of reception class.”",News/Education,"Younger children most affected by Covid lockdowns, new research finds",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/18/younger-children-most-affected-by-covid-lockdowns-new-research-finds
5/18/2022,"The world’s largest carmakers are lagging behind on the switch to electric vehicles with only two on the trajectory required to hit the international target of limiting global heating to 1.5C, according to an analysis. Tesla and Mercedes-Benz are the only firms out of 12 big manufacturers who are on course to shift to zero-emissions vehicles at a rate in line with climate goals, according to the campaign group InfluenceMap. Carmakers around the world are racing to introduce new cars with zero exhaust emissions of carbon, and almost every big brand plans to move to battery electric technology. However, at the same time manufacturers are trying to keep selling their highly profitable diesel and petrol cars. The carmakers that plan the slowest adoption of zero-emissions technology are the three biggest Japanese producers – Toyota, Honda and Nissan – while other laggards included South Korea’s Hyundai and General Motors in the US. The analysis, based on forecasts to 2029 produced by the data company IHS Markit, included 12 of the world’s largest carmakers, although it did not include the largest Chinese manufacturers. The shift to zero-emissions vehicles is seen as crucial for the world’s transition away from polluting fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency, a watchdog respected by industry and campaigners, has calculated that 57.5% of global car sales must be zero-emission vehicles by 2030 (equivalent to 52% by 2029) if global heating is to be limited to only 1.5C. Should the world go beyond that target, agreed at the 2015 Paris climate conference, the scientific consensus is that increasing proportions of the globe will become unliveable. Tesla, the electric carmaker led by Elon Musk, produces 100% zero-emission vehicles, while Germany’s Mercedes-Benz is on track to produce 56% battery cars by 2029. By contrast, Toyota and Honda are on track to produce only 14% and 18% zero-emissions cars by 2029, according to IHS Markit, as they bet on extended fossil fuel sales. Ben Youriev, a programme manager at InfluenceMap, said: “A rapid scale-up of battery electric vehicles is critical to meeting global climate change goals. Almost all automakers are failing to keep pace with the transition to zero emissions.” There is still a chance that some of the carmakers could decide to accelerate their transitions to electric vehicles. Regulatory changes in several markets, including the UK and EU, and the rapidly falling cost of producing zero-emissions vehicles will give manufacturers a greater incentive to shift away from petrol and diesel. The US carmaker Ford, which last year said it would go all-electric in Europe by 2030, on Tuesday called for petrol and diesel car sales to be banned in the EU by 2035, in a joint letter with Sweden’s Volvo and other leading companies including Tesco, Uber and Unilever. A VW spokesperson said the company agrees “100% that the rapid shift to e-mobility is essential to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees”, and said it plans an overall share of battery electric vehicles of “around 50%” by 2030. BMW said it plans at least half of all sales being all-electric by 2030. Stellantis said 100% of its car and van sales in Europe and 50% of its car and light truck sales in the US will be battery-powered by 2030. A Nissan spokesman said the company had committed to aligning with a 1.5C scenario and that its science-based targets for below 2C alignment had been validated independently. A Honda spokesman said it “will continue to accelerate towards both electrification and carbon neutrality goals”. The other carmakers below the 1.5C threshold were also approached for comment.",News/Business,"Big carmakers stuck in slow lane over switch to zero emissions, study shows",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/18/big-carmakers-stuck-in-slow-lane-over-switch-to-zero-emissions-study-shows
5/18/2022,"More than 27,000 nurses and midwives quit the NHS last year, with many blaming job pressures, the Covid pandemic and poor patient care for their decision. The rise in staff leaving their posts across the UK – the first in four years – has prompted concern that frontline workers are under too much strain, especially with the NHS-wide shortage of nurses. New figures show the NHS is also becoming more reliant on nurses and midwives trained overseas as domestic recruitment remains stubbornly low. In a report on Wednesday, the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) discloses that the numbers in both professions across the UK has risen to its highest level – 758,303. However, while 48,436 nurses and midwives joined its register, 27,133 stopped working last year – 25,219 nurses, 1,474 midwives and 304 who performed both roles. That was higher than the 23,934 who did so during 2020 after Covid struck, and 25,488 who left in 2019. “With more than 500 nurses and midwives leaving every week, there’s no room for government complacency [about NHS staffing],” said Sara Gorton, the head of health at the union Unison. Andrea Sutcliffe, the NMC’s chief executive, said that while the record number of nurses and midwives was good news, “a closer look at our data reveals some worrying signs”. She cited the large number of leavers and the fact that “those who left shared troubling stories about the pressure they’ve had to bear during the pandemic”. The NMC asked 6,458 of those who quit last year for the three main reasons they had done so. Too much pressure (18.3%), negative workplace culture (13%), Covid (11.8%) and disillusion with the quality of care that patients receive (8.1%) emerged as key factors, although retirement (42.9%) and a change in personal circumstances (21.7%) were the two commonest reasons. “Too much pressure” was defined as staff feeling stressed and having poor mental health. The NHS in England has almost 40,000 nursing posts and more than 8,000 posts for doctors unfilled. The supply of homegrown nurses has increased only slightly despite the government reinstating financial support worth up to £8,000 a year for trainee nurses. Of the 48,436 staff who joined the NMC register, just under half – 23,408 (48%) – were from abroad, of whom 66% were trained in India or the Philippines. That is a huge increase on the 2,719 who came in 2017-18. James Buchan, a senior visiting fellow at the Health Foundation thinktank, said: “International recruitment is very much a short-term, quick-fix solution that may come at the expense of long-term workforce planning and domestic supply.” Pat Cullen, the chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, raised concerns about the NHS taking nurses from low-income countries. “The UK’s health and care workforce is proudly diverse, but it [recruitment] must be done ethically,” she said. Brexit has badly hit the NHS workforce, the NMC figures show. In 2015-16, before the June 2016 referendum on EU membership, 9,389 nurses and midwives came to work in the UK from the EU and European Economic Area. Last year just 663 did so, the lowest number for many years. Fewer than 1,000 have done so each year since 2017-18. Sajid Javid, the health and social care secretary, welcomed the record numbers on the NMC register. “I’m determined to continue growing the workforce to help us tackle the Covid backlog and reduce waiting lists, and we are on track to deliver 50,000 more nurses by 2024, with over 30,000 more working in the NHS since September 2019,” he said.",News/Society,Numbers of nurses and midwives leaving NHS highest for four years,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/18/numbers-of-nurses-and-midwives-leaving-nhs-highest-for-four-years
5/18/2022,"Well, it was always going that way wasn’t it? At St Mary’s, Jürgen Klopp picked a fever dream of a Liverpool first XI for the penultimate game of the Premier League season, then saw his team fall behind after 13 minutes needing to win to take this pursuit of the sun, the chase for the quadruple, to the final day. And still, somehow, it never really seemed in doubt. This Liverpool team has too much energy to stop now. And while it seems only right to point out the pursuit of the league title is still heavily asterisked, that it isn’t in Liverpool’s hands, Manchester City will be all too aware of the pressure at their backs. There has been a weird kind of voodoo about the current run. City have barely stuttered. They’ve also kept on winning, burying the pain of Madrid, playing like champions. Players have begun to break and fall away. The games have become frantic. But that gleaming set of teeth is still there in the rear-view mirror. Here it was Liverpool’s deep reserves that kept them moving forward, driven on by a command performance from James Milner, who played half a game in the middle and half a game on the right, touched the ball more than anyone else on the pitch, and spent the 90 minutes cajoling his teammates over the line like a long-suffering dad on a cross-country hike. St Mary’s is one of the more hospitable away grounds at the best of times. Before kickoff a marching band tootled away through the rain outside the stadium. No flares were thrown. No baying crowd greeted the team buses. Inside the atmosphere brought to mind a fond early summer village fete. Whereas for Liverpool this was jeopardy, destiny, the edge of things. And for all the changes (nine of them) it was pretty clear with 30 seconds gone how this Liverpool team would play: like a Liverpool team. The yellow shirts came out swarming around the centre circle, stealing the ball. The high press was fierce. The shapes were the same. Kostas Tsimikas stood thrillingly high on the left flank. To their credit, Southampton provided resistance, and even took the lead with a fine deflected finish from Nathan Redmond. At which point Milner began to hitch up his sleeves, providing a supreme driving presence in that opening half-hour. Milner has a timeless look to him these days. He doesn’t really run. He stalks. He doesn’t caress the ball, or thread it, or glide it. He clumps it. He kicks it like a man dishing out a fond, correctional repunishment, the kind of licks the ball will thank him for when it’s old enough. And through all this he looks oddly indestructible, an athlete made from some untiring super-substance – ancient Roman leather, whalebone and buffalo hide. Here he played in front of the defence, occupied the centre ground, passed the ball forward, a player who has gone from part-time false nine in his Manchester City days to the footballing equivalent of the muddy pair of wellies Klopp keeps in the boot of his car for moments like these. In the first half alone he completed 97% of his 54 passes, had two shots at goal and made four interceptions. He never at any stage looked like a man losing a football match. And with 26 minutes gone there was a flex of the shoulders from Liverpool. Joe Gomez crossed the ball from the right to Diogo Jota’s feet. He produced a wonderful touch, killing the ball, but also diverting it on into the run of Taki Minamino, a courteous, dutiful little pass. Minamino took two perfect touches, before spanking the ball into the top corner. It was an excellent goal-at-1-0-down goal, a goal that said we will just keep playing this way. Jordan Henderson came on at half-time and Milner moved to right-back. With 58 minutes gone he was up there jinking and feinting on the wing, dummying Redmond like a teenager. Milner is out of contract in June. The club have offered him another 12 months. Surely he’s going to take it. Where else is he going to go? This is the kind of leader-by-default every organisation craves, asking nothing, screwing the joints into place, the wookie in the engine room, bolting this thing together on the hoof, banging the circuit boards. It was from that right side that Liverpool’s second goal came. Milner’s cross, one of 10 in that half alone, was a horrible swirling, veering thing that skimmed away for a corner. The kick from the left cannoned off a couple of heads and ended up looping into the goal off Joël Matip, who kind of knew what he was doing. And that was pretty much that. Liverpool have played 61 games since August. They have two games left to play, the two biggest trophies in club football still just about on the line. Wolves at home on Sunday will see the return of the first XI. Here they were led by their general in reserve – his last act was to go down with some well-earned cramp as the clock ticked past 90 minutes.",Sport/Football,Milner’s command performance keeps Liverpool in fight for title | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/17/james-milner-liverpool-southampton-premier-league
5/18/2022,"Jürgen Klopp has said if he was in Pep Guardiola’s shoes he would not consider the title race to be over despite Liverpool requiring an unlikely series of events on the final day of the season to prevent Manchester City from retaining their Premier League crown. Liverpool, who came from behind to brush aside Southampton on Tuesday, will topple the leaders and keep alive their hopes of an unprecedented quadruple if they beat Wolves at Anfield on Sunday and City drop points at home against Aston Villa, who are managed by the former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard. “If I was in the other situation, then I don’t feel like I am champion already, that is how it is,” Klopp said. “From my point of view, in second you are thinking that of course City will win that game. But it is football. We have to first win our game. It is not like we are talking about Wolves like they are not there. It is possible, not likely but possible. That is enough.” Klopp made nine changes to the team that lifted the FA Cup at Wembley on Saturday for the trip to St Mary’s and his gamble was rewarded with Takumi Minamino, who finished last season on loan at Southampton, and Joel Matip overturning Nathan Redmond’s early strike to secure victory. Klopp praised his squad, comparing those who came into his team to “Ferraris in the garage” and conceded that if his rotation backfired it would have been “1000%” his fault. “I am so happy about the performance. It was a bit touching,” he said. “You think: ‘Wow, these boys.’ It is like having Ferraris in the garage. You let them out and they do it like this. Harvey [Elliott], I’m not sure the last time he played; Curtis [Jones] no rhythm, he has only played from time to time; Takumi Minamino, it is a crime he is not playing more often. [Alex] Oxlade-Chamberlain] did not even play and he is in outstanding shape. It is really tough for the boys sometimes. Whatever happens this year happens because of this group.” The only scenario whereby goal difference could play a part on Sunday is if Liverpool draw and City lose heavily. City, who drew 2-2 at West Ham on Sunday, have a superior goal difference: +72 goals to Liverpool’s +66. Guardiola’s side have not dropped points in successive league games since December 2020. James Milner, who captained Liverpool until Jordan Henderson replaced Joe Gomez at half-time when the defender was withdrawn with an ankle injury, said a “mental reset” in January when Liverpool were third and trailed City by 11 points helped them to close the gap. “We’ve really pushed,” he said. “City are an incredible team to go up against. Whatever happens we’ve done ourselves proud.” Asked about the Blackpool teenager Jake Daniels becoming the first male footballer to come out as gay since 1990, Klopp said: “The whole football community will support him with whatever we can do, I’m 100% sure. He was right [in] what he said – he didn’t want to hide any more. Good. “I don’t know him but I’m really proud of him. It was an important step. We live in 2022 and that we have to make such a big thing of it is crazy but we’re getting there. It is a good start and now I hope that others will follow and can do that as well. I’m really happy for him.”",Sport/Football,‘It is possible’: Liverpool’s Jürgen Klopp tells Pep Guardiola title race is still on,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/17/it-is-possible-liverpools-jurgen-klopp-tells-pep-guardiola-title-race-is-still-on
5/18/2022,"The man found civilly liable for the 1998 Omagh bombing in which 29 people were killed has been extradited to Lithuania after a lengthy legal process. The Irish supreme court ruled last week that Liam Campbell could be extradited to the Baltic country in relation to offences of smuggling, the possession of firearms and terrorism. It is understood that the 59-year-old was arrested by Irish police on Monday before being handed over to Lithuanian authorities at Dublin airport on Tuesday. A Garda spokesperson said: “Liam Campbell was surrendered to the Lithuanian authorities by personnel assigned to the extradition section at the Garda National Bureau of Criminal Investigation this morning and has subsequently departed from Dublin airport.” A five-judge supreme court bench last week dismissed Campbell’s appeal against his extradition, ending his legal battle to avoid extradition to Lithuania that lasted more than 12 years. It was the third time Lithuanian authorities had attempted to obtain his surrender. He was arrested in December 2016 in Upper Faughart, Dundalk, County Louth on a second European arrest warrant (EAW) issued by Lithuanian authorities. The arrest warrant alleged that he organised the preparation for the smuggling of weapons in support of the “terrorist grouping” the Real IRA (RIRA) between the end of 2006 and the beginning of 2007. The Lithuanian warrant also contained allegations of preparations to smuggle items including firearms and explosive substances, and attempting to acquire weapons, ammunition, explosives and items including detonators and timers. The Omagh bombing was the single biggest atrocity of the Troubles. Among the victims were a woman pregnant with twins as well as children from Northern Ireland, England and Spain. In 2016, Campbell and Michael McKevitt were unsuccessful in their appeal to overturn the landmark civil ruling that found them responsible along with two other men for the Omagh bombing. The European court of human rights in Strasbourg declared that the 2009 ruling by a Belfast court – which awarded £1.6m in damages to relatives of the 29 people who died – should not be challenged. Both men were ordered to pay compensation.

5/18/2022,"Pollution is killing 9 million people a year, a review has found, making it responsible for one in six of all deaths. Toxic air and contaminated water and soil “is an existential threat to human health and planetary health, and jeopardises the sustainability of modern societies”, the review concluded. The death toll from pollution dwarfs that from road traffic deaths, HIV/Aids, malaria and TB combined, or from drug and alcohol misuse. The researchers calculated the economic impact of pollution deaths at $4.6tn (£3.7tn), about $9m a minute. The overall impact of pollution has not improved since the first global review in 2017, since when 45 million lives have been lost to it. Prevention was largely overlooked in the international development agenda, the researchers said, with funding increasing only minimally since 2015. Deaths from toxic air and chemicals have risen by 7% since the previous review and 66% since 2000, driven by increased fossil fuel burning, rising population numbers and unplanned urbanisation. This rise was offset by improvements in the “ancient scourges” of water polluted by pathogens and poor sanitation and indoor smoke from cooking fires. The researchers said pollution, the climate crisis and the destruction of wildlife and nature “are the key global environmental issues of our time. These issues are intricately linked and solutions to each will benefit the others. [But] we cannot continue to ignore pollution. We are going backwards.” Prof Philip Landrigan, at Boston College in the US and a lead author of the analysis, said: “Pollution is still the largest existential threat to human and planetary health. Preventing pollution can also slow climate change – achieving a double benefit for planetary health – and our report calls for a massive, rapid transition away from all fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy.” Awareness of pollution was key, said Richard Fuller, at the Global Alliance on Health and Pollution (GAHP) in Switzerland, another lead author. He said action plans have been presented to 11 national governments to date: “Ministers are just gobsmacked at how big an impact pollution is having in their country.” Measuring pollution and making it public also drives change, he said: “It switches on communities to want to do something and yell and scream at their politicians. Everything can roll from that.” The new review, published in the journal Lancet Planetary Health, analysed data from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease project, the most recent available, and found air pollution caused almost 75% of the 9 million pollution deaths. Toxic chemicals resulted in 1.8 million deaths, including 900,000 deaths from lead pollution, which is more than from HIV/Aids. Lead poisoning could significantly reduce intelligence across large populations, Fuller said, sources of which include water pipes, paint, backyard car battery recycling, as well foodstuffs such as contaminated turmeric. The number of deaths from chemical pollutants was likely to be an underestimate, the scientists said, as only a small proportion of the 350,000 synthetic chemicals in use had been adequately tested for safety. The cocktail of chemical pollution that pervades the planet has passed the safe limit for the stability of global ecosystems upon which humanity depends, researchers reported in January. More than 90% of pollution deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, such as India and Nigeria. While high-income countries, such as the US and members of the EU, had controlled the worst forms of pollution, the researchers said, few less affluent nations had been able to make pollution a priority. Pollution also crossed international borders, carried on winds or in food exports, said Fuller: “If we’re going to keep everyone safe, we need to help countries that have these toxic problems to stop the pollution at the source.” Unsafe water causes 1.4 million early deaths a year but this has been falling due to improvements in sanitation and healthcare, particularly in Africa. However, the UN estimates more than 2 billion people still do not have access to clean drinking water. The researchers called for increased funding for pollution control from governments and donors, better monitoring and a new independent scientific body to assess the problem, modelled on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, whose influential reports are agreed by all governments. “Pollution has typically been viewed as a local issue,” said Rachael Kupka, also at GAHP, which includes the UN Environment Programme and the World Bank. “However, it is clear that pollution is a planetary threat. Global action on all major modern pollutants is needed.”",News/Environment,"Pollution responsible for one in six deaths across planet, scientists warn",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/17/pollution-responsible-one-in-six-deaths-across-planet
