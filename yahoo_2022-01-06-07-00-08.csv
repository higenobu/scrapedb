1/6/2022,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — Authorities have located the mother of a baby found abandoned in a cardboard box in frigid conditions in Fairbanks last week, Alaska State Troopers reported Wednesday. A unit within the troopers that handles major cases identified and located the mother Tuesday, and she was taken to a Fairbanks-area hospital for evaluation and medical care, troopers said in a statement. The mother was identified as a juvenile. “The investigation into the circumstances surrounding the baby being abandoned is ongoing, and no criminal charges have been filed at this time,” the statement said. Troopers on Tuesday reported the child, known as Teshawn from a note left in the box, was in good health and in the care of the Office of Children’s Services. Troopers at the time said they were submitting the child's DNA to a database as part of efforts to find immediate family. Troopers previously said they were notified about the abandoned baby Friday afternoon, when the wind chill factor in the area was reported at minus 12. A woman posted on social media that she found the baby. The post included included a video that showed a baby swaddled in a box and a note. The note, written from the child’s perspective, said, “Please help me!!!” The note indicated the child was born Friday, but added that the baby’s parents and grandparents didn’t have food or money to provide care. The post was taken down or made private, and the person who posted it didn't respond to a message from The Associated Press. Alaska has a safe haven law that allows parents to legally surrender an infant under certain conditions, such as leaving the baby in the physical custody of someone such as a peace officer, doctor, hospital employee or firefighter or with someone they believe would provide appropriate care. The law applies to babies younger than 21 days old.",U.S./Associated Press,Authorities locate mother of baby found in box in Alaska,https://news.yahoo.com/efforts-continue-alaska-abandon-babys-015113200.html
1/6/2022,"A woman says her dog died on a Southwest flight because crew wouldn't let him out of his carrier. Courtney Cipar believes Charlie suffered from heatstroke and a seizure, and plans to sue the airline. Southwest Airlines told TMZ that it's the airline's policy that pets must remain in their carriers. A woman says her dog died during a recent Southwest Airlines flight after cabin crew refused to let her take him out of his dog carrier, as TMZ first reported on Tuesday. The passenger, Courtney Cipar, told the outlet she is an X-ray technician and traveled across the US with her 3-year-old support dog, Charlie, to comfort patients suffering from COVID-19. Charlie, a French Bulldog, died on December 21 on board a Philadelphia-bound Southwest Airlines flight from Pensacola after a layover in Nashville, according to a statement from Cipar's attorney, Evan Oshan of the personal-injury firm Oshan & Associates. Southwest Airlines did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment, though in a statement to TMZ, a representative for the airline said they were ""disheartened to learn about the passing of this customer's pet and have been in contact with her to learn more."" Oshan told Insider the airline reached out to Cipar to offer a free flight ticket, but had not contacted his client since. The attorney said Cipar plans to sue the airline over Charlie's death and the grievance caused. Cipar told TMZ she believes her dog died from heatstroke and a seizure, and that Charlie had had no prior health issues. Speaking to Insider, Oshan said there are no details about Charlie's official cause of death, and that it is unclear whether a necropsy has been conducted. ""While on the flight my travel companion Charlie began having breathing problems,"" Cipar said in the statement from her attorney, adding that the pet was in his dog carrier and that she had paid for him as a passenger. ""When I attempted to take Charlie out of the carrier or even open the carrier the Southwest airline personnel threatened to turn the plane back and that I would have consequences,"" she added. ""As Charlie moaned for air I was unable to help him and he died."" ""The Southwest airline staff essentially allowed my Charlie to die,"" she said. In its statement to TMZ, Southwest Airlines said that ""tens of thousands of Customers travel with cats and dogs every month,"" and that it requires pets to ""remain in their well-ventilated carriers at all times for the comfort and safety of fellow Customers."" Oshan told Insider that dogs and other pets traveling with their owners have the right to be treated with the same respect and dignity as any other paying passenger. ""Once again the airlines have not taken our four legged family members into account,"" he said. ""Charlie was a paying passenger and desired to be allowed to breathe,"" he added. ""His travel companion — a health care worker was bullied and not allowed to help him.""
