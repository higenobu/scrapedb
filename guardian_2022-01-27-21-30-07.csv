1/27/2022,"As a professional actor living with dwarfism, all I could do when I read Peter Dinklage’s critical comments about Disney’s forthcoming live-action remake of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs was nod in agreement. Peter is a much more famous actor than I am, but my disability politics are very similar to his. I am very aware of the importance of representation, and of how few genuine and humanising representations there are of people with dwarfism on our screens and on our stages.  I am so careful about the roles I pick because I know that, if I get it wrong, there will be repercussions for some innocent person with dwarfism just minding their own business. I don’t want what I create as an artist to be used to bring a random person down in the middle of their day. I had “Mini-Me” yelled at me by strangers for years after Austin Powers came out. “Hi-ho, hi-ho,” is regularly hummed or sung at me by passersby. I am filmed and photographed by strangers for who knows what on social media. Most insults are simply regurgitated rubbish that people have picked up from somewhere in the social repertoire of negative and dehumanising media portrayals. Most people have never met a person with dwarfism. It is a rare condition. People only have a very few reference points: pantomime, Disney’s 1937 animated film, something ridiculing that they saw in the press or on TV, the punchline to a comedian’s joke, a dehumanised character such as Mini-Me in a film. The recurring “Hippo Eats Dwarf” fake news article is the kind of degrading swill that circulates every few years. On the other hand, I don’t have a problem with Tolkien’s fantasy Lord of the Rings. His Hobbits and Dwarves are clearly stylised fairy folk. It is so disappointing that I am still more likely to be a mum, lover, secretary, lawyer, teacher or doctor in real life than to play one in a Disney film. It worries me that Disney hasn’t even reached the basic milestone of representing disabled bodies in ordinary ways, yet are now undertaking the creatively fraught challenge of humanising their seven most famous disability tropes. A live-action version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs will remove the safety net that animation provided. These cute, dehumanised, infantilised, animalistic creatures known in the 1937 film only by their labels, Dopey, Happy, Doc, etc, are not fully people. Nor are they fully fairytale creatures. Interestingly, their naming did not originate from the original Brothers Grimm tale but was a Disney invention. But as a cartoon, it is “pretend”, more forgivable. It is still problematic but with more distance from me, in the real world. The dated nature of the animation also reduces the hurt it causes because it was from another time, predating the disability rights movement. And before you question me: yes, I do identify as disabled. At 3-feet-something-secret tall, I can only drive an adapted car and cook safely in an adapted kitchen. My life requires modifications and adaptations. I am disabled on the street by negative attitudes and prejudice I meet in the community and broader society. If you need more information to understand what I mean, Google “the social model of disability”. I simply cannot see how Disney can make a live action version of its 1937 film without falling into disablist stereotypes of people with dwarfism. It will have to involve disabled creatives, and empower people with dwarfism to forge their own representations, steer their own roles in the story and give space to their voices. Disney will have to listen. Which means being open to awkward conversations and the workshopping of ideas from a minority community. Disney has responded to concerns in a statement: “To avoid reinforcing stereotypes from the original animated film, we are taking a different approach with these seven characters and have been consulting with members of the dwarfism community. We look forward to sharing more as the film heads into production after a lengthy development period.” But in general, this is not something film production is renowned for doing well, or at all. And it is a process that is often glossed over with a tokenistic wave of the hand. I have too often been the only disabled person in the rehearsal room on a shoot. And as an actor, there is a fine line between “advocating bravely” and being “emotionally frigid and just not open to their ideas”. You aren’t the director, but you are the only one who knows the experience and how you are seen in the world. This leads me to doubt that Disney is currently capable of making the massive ideological leap needed to create a film in which the seven dwarfs are the fully fledged humans they should be. With real names, rounded characters and having some kind of agency. Here’s an idea, though: the seven dwarfs could live in a house that is only accessible to people 4ft 2in tall. With an adapted kitchen and adapted vehicles. So all the average height people in their world are forced to bend over for 40% of the film, sit in little chairs and stoop to use the stove. Maybe back pain destroys the evil queen, and the perils of bad ergonomic design are really and truly explored. That would be an interesting take on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Let the average-height people be disabled by design and attitude for once.",Arts/Film,Peter Dinklage is right: a live-action Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a fundamentally awful idea,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/27/peter-dinklage-snow-white-and-the-seven-dwarfs-disablist-representation-disney

Spurs ended last week confident of landing Traoré but they are in danger of losing out to Barcelona, where the player started his career.  Details of any transfer to Barcelona are being discussed, with one option being an initial loan. Traoré will not extend his contract beyond the end of next season at Wolves, who rejected an opening £15m offer from Spurs. The Wolves manager, Bruno Lage, would like to keep the 26-year-old until the summer but the club are ready to strike a deal that meets their demands. Traoré joined the Barcelona youth set-up and made his way via the B team to a first-team debut in 2013 but he left for Aston Villa in 2015 after only four appearances.

1/27/2022,"Elza Soares, who has died aged 91, was one of the finest, best-loved singers in Brazil, a glamorous, spirited performer who triumphed over personal tragedy and never forgot her hungry childhood in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. She was an exponent of the many different forms of samba, Brazil’s most enduring and ever-evolving style, and constantly on the lookout for new experiments and fusions. And she was a bravely outspoken campaigner for women’s rights, and against racism. As a black musician she experienced racism in the industry first-hand – despite her remarkable talent, record companies were slow to sign her. Two albums, recorded 54 years apart, demonstrate her extraordinary range. She began recording in the early 1960s, just as João Gilberto, Antônio Carlos Jobim and Vinicius de Moraes were pioneering the cool new fusion of samba cançao, jazz and classical styles known as bossa nova. Soares had very different ideas. On her second album, A Bossa Negra (The Black Bossa, 1961) she matched sensual, delicate and husky vocals against swinging big band brass backing in songs that would suddenly change direction as she switched to furious growled scat singing worthy of Louis Armstrong on Perdäo (Forgiveness), or an ecstatic scream at the end of Beija-Me (Kiss Me). These were fresh, exciting songs to match the optimism of Brazil in the early 60s, and established Soares as a major force.  Spool forward to 2015, and there was a very different Brazilian music scene. São Paulo had now taken over from Rio as the creative music centre, and on the extraordinary A Mulher Do Fim Do Mundo (The Woman at the End of the World) she was joined by members of the punk, candomblé and jazz-influenced Méta Méta and Afrobeat-inspired Bixiga 70 for a set that mixed samba with distorted rock and jazz influences. There were edgy, unnerving songs about domestic violence or the death of a crack addict, and Soares dominated the set with her often harsh-edged, powerful vocals. It was the Brazilian album of the year, and rightly won her a Latin Grammy award. She loved to experiment, but stayed in touch with her musical roots. The samba schools that compete at the Rio carnival with their music and flamboyant costumes are also social centres with strong links with the local community. Soares supported the Mocidade school, in the neighbourhood where she grew up, and on a hot Saturday night in 2007 she gave a thrilling performance there, filmed for the BBC series Brasil, Brasil. She sang from a balcony overlooking the large, packed dancefloor, wearing a short black dress, a black wig with a red flower, looking decades younger than her age. She began with a rousing, emotional tribute to the school, Salve A Mocidade (Save Mocidade), which she had first recorded in the 70s, and told me: “I love this school. I love this community. It’s my heart”. Soares was born in the Padre Miguel neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro, the daughter of a samba-loving, guitar-playing factory worker, Avelino Gomes, and a washer woman, Rosária Maria da Conceição. When she was 12 her father forced her to marry Lourdes Antônio Soares, and a year later she gave birth to her first child. Desperately poor, but already a music lover, she entered a singing contest hosted by the musician Ary Barroso on the popular station Rádio Tupi, wearing a dress borrowed from her mother. When asked where she came from, the teenager replied “planet hunger”. She won the contest, and money to feed her growing family. She was inspired to keep singing, but problems continued. Her husband died of tuberculosis when she was 21, and she worked in a soap factory and said she stole food to survive. She was now a widow with five children to support. But she persevered, built up a reputation singing in the Copacabana clubs, and toured Argentina before finally recording her debut album, Se Acaso Você Chegasse (If By Chance You Came), in 1960, introducing scat singing to samba. She became a bestselling celebrity, travelling to Chile when Brazil played in the Fifa World Cup, meeting Armstrong, and working with the singer Miltinho and the virtuoso percussionist Wilson Das Neves. In 2007 he described her to me as “unprecedented. No-one equals her as a performer.” But her personal life now brought scandal and yet more tragedy. In 1968 she married the soccer star Manuel Francisco dos Santos, better known by his nickname Mané Garrincha, who was a national hero in Brazil. She was accused of breaking up his earlier marriage, their house was attacked, and for several years the couple were forced to leave Rio for São Paulo and then Italy. Garrincha was a heavy drinker, and was driving drunk when Soares’ mother was killed in a car crash in 1969. Soares tried to help him, touring the bars trying to stop them serving her husband, but this made her all the more unpopular with his friends. Garrincha died of cirrhosis in 1983, by which time the couple were separated, but she was said to be devastated. Three years later their only son, who was named after his father, was killed in another car accident. Depressed, Soares left Brazil, travelling to Europe and Los Angeles, trying to start an international career. She returned after encouragement from the Tropicália star Caetano Veloso, who had asked her to sing on his 1984 album, Velô, and gradually regained her success. In 1999 she appeared at the celebrity-packed Since Samba Has Been Samba show at London’s Royal Albert Hall, alongside a cast that included Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Chico Buarque and Georgie Fame. But her most experimental years were still to come, as she began to explore samba sujo (“dirty samba”), influenced by the hip hop and funk styles that were becoming popular in the favelas. Do Cóccix Até o Pescoço (From Top to Tail, 2002) included a Veloso song and a human beatbox artist and was nominated for a Latin Grammy, while Vivo Feliz (I Live Happily, 2004) included rap and heavy bass lines. Performing the songs at the Jazz Cafe in London that year she bounded on stage making mewing and growling noises before stomping through a new anthem, Rio De Janeiro, with the rapper Anderson Lugão. Following the groundbreaking A Mulher Do Fim Do Mundo she recorded two further highly praised albums, Deus É Mulher (God and Woman) in 2018 and Planeta Fome (Planet Hunger) in 2019. Both were nominated for Latin Grammys, with the title of her final and 35th album providing a reminder of that now-legendary comment she made as a teenager. She is survived by four of the children from her first marriage, João Carlos, Gerson, Dilma and Sara.

1/27/2022,"After 84 minutes and 39 seconds of Liverpool’s win at Crystal Palace on Sunday, Diogo Jota ran on to the ball, chested it, miskicked it, planted his leg into the path of Vicente Guaita and went down. Three seconds of action which Kevin Friend apparently watched 17 times before deciding to give a penalty. Those three seconds were of course repeated and analysed by Sky Sports, and by Sky Sports News, by Match Of the Day and all over social media – the moment has been viewed almost 400,000 times on Sky Sports’ Twitter from just after the game. If you add all the posts, fan pages and every account that uploaded it to every platform, it amounts to millions of us repeatedly watching a man sliding into another man and falling on the ground.  “An absolutely disgraceful decision” was Alan Shearer’s verdict. “Can you tell I’m angry?” He continued. “It’s a nonsense,” said Glenn Hoddle. “An absolute nonsense.” Neil Warnock added an agenda to proceedings: “They get away with murder, the top clubs.” Mark Clattenburg and Keith Hackett used their national newspaper columns to talk about it. Phone-ins, YouTube channels, podcasts devoting hours to this moment. By contrast, the three preceding seconds of the match were a thing of total beauty. Trent Alexander-Arnold intercepted the ball, and played a raking, arrow-like 50-yard pass into Jota’s path. It was such an exceptional piece of skill, to decide in a split second to attempt it, to execute the perfect technique – to just kick it so absolutely perfectly. And this highlights the absurdity of how we consume football – and how little time we spend talking about the bit where players kick the ball, which ultimately feels like quite an important part of the whole affair. Far be it from me to suggest replacing articles about how much injury time Jon Moss played at the King Power or whether Craig Pawson has VAR nightmares about Ryan Fraser with the 10 best kicks of the weekend, but there is a question about what we value in the game and what we want from it. And before attempting to claim any sort of moral high ground in all of this, I’m equally guilty. Monday’s Football Weekly podcast began with a five-minute deconstruction of Jotagate, then a throwaway mention of Alexander-Arnold’s pass before moving on to talking about the match itself. And there is clearly merit in discussing game-changing decisions, VAR and the humans behind the VAR. Very occasionally there is a kick of such astounding beauty that football stops to appreciate it. Thiago Alcântara’s half-volley against Porto in the Champions League – the one that skimmed like a stone – was so perfect it was art. It was so utterly non-fungible - hang that up and put it in a musuem, download it and get John Terry to pawn it off as a crypto-meme. I still can’t work out if it grazed the turf before taking off like a low-flying fighter jet. How does someone manage to swing their foot at an inflated round butyl rubber bladder with such effortless timing and grace that it forces someone miles away to let out an involuntary scream of joy from their sofa? Of course different fans want different things, but nothing gives me more pleasure than watching Tom Huddlestone stroke the ball around the pitch with either foot like he’s fizzing a five-iron down the fairway. That’s my ultimate clickbait. And there are those who just want us to talk about the football – but it turns out it’s harder to do that than to press the buttons of perceived injustice, agendas and outrage at a referring decision or a player’s haircut. There’s no debate about Thiago’s strike. Roy Keane and Graeme Souness can’t have a row about Youssef M’Changama’s free-kick for Comoros against Cameroon, or Gabadinho Mhango’s opener for Malawi in their defeat by Morocco. They were just brilliant strikes. Once you’ve said that, what more can you add? And (genuine) disagreements make for more interesting analysis. It’s much easier to create debate about the need for common sense and consistency, to hold Mike Riley responsible for all the ills in the game. I do wonder how many of us actually want every decision to be correct, or do we subconsciously want to feel like the world is against us? There’s a real sense that some fans are determined to find conclusive “proof” that there really is an agenda against [insert whoever you support here]. And the opportunity to feel wronged brings fans together. It unifies us. I’m still slightly annoyed that David O’Leary wasn’t sent off for pulling Cambridge’s John Taylor down when he was clean through in the 1991 FA Cup quarter-final at Highbury. And in the hierarchy of things that actually matter, the art of kicking a ball is quite a long way behind the other aspects of the game that receive minimal coverage compared to VAR and referees. We haven’t got the balance right when it comes to discussing the easy things, and covering the corruption, human rights abuses, racism and misogyny. It’s a depressing and increasing list. But when it comes to those easy things – whenever we analyse a football match regardless of whether it’s in a TV studio or in the pub or we’re all making editorial decisions. Which bit of that game interested us the most? What are the biggest moments? Which bits did we enjoy? What made us angry? What made us laugh? What made us cry? Every part of it is valid. I enjoy talking about all of it. I just sometimes wonder if we should spend a little more time admiring how good these people are at kicking footballs – because that is where it all starts and ends.",Sport/Football,"However you get a kick out of football, certain kicks deserve to be cherished | Max Rushden",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/27/certain-football-kicks-deserve-to-be-cherished-liverpool
1/27/2022,"‘OK, Dad, this is an incredible essay on the effects of grief and grey morality in a postapocalyptic society,” says the eldest child, AKA the millennial. “It’s got proper female characters, progressive takes on sexuality and tonnes of rain.” “They’ve made a video game of The Handmaid’s Tale?”  “No, Dad. It’s The Last of Us. Don’t worry. It’s still a zombie shooter. And both games have the best ending ever.” Now she has my interest. Video game endings fascinate me, because my generation started out with arcade games that didn’t have them. Pac-Man kept eating dots and chasing ghosts and the Space Invaders kept coming, wave after incessant wave. The first arcade game that had an actual ending was Dragon’s Lair and nobody actually saw that because it was so hard to complete. I have a tough start with The Last of Us because I hate games where you search for stuff in every room of a house. I spend my normal life doing that with car keys and headphones. I want games where you walk into a room and all the objects get sucked into a magic pocket. But that isn’t realistic, I hear you cry. Well, neither is only being able to carry three shivs in a world where, despite the zombie apocalypse, cargo pants clearly still exist. I also hate any form of crafting, because that was what my generation had to do for “fun” as kids before we had video games. Whether it’s smoke bombs from sugar and explosives or a set of Action Man drawers from matchboxes, it’s all boring to me. “Keep going,” I tell myself. “The millennial says it’s got the best ending ever.” Throughout the first chapter of Joel and Ellie’s jaunt across a post-infected US I keep trying to guess what this great ending will be. Maybe Ellie isn’t immune to infection after all? Maybe Joel is her real father? Maybe they’re both unwitting participants in some reality TV show, I’m Infected Get Me Out of Here? As you will all know by now – and if you’ve yet to play The Last of Us then please stop reading – the ending has Joel murder a perfectly innocent and well-intentioned doctor who wants to cut Ellie open to find a cure that will save humanity. But Joel has no truck with utilitarian philosophy, because Ellie has now become a replacement for the daughter he lost. So, he disregards mankind’s future and, by stopping the operation, effectively murders the entire human race (alongside a whole hospital’s worth of doctors). “Why does he do that?” I asked the millennial, in one of many fantastic discussions we had about the game. “Because he’s a white male,” came the answer, because it’s 2022 and she’s in her 20s. And maybe she’s right. Either way it is a jaw-dropping, supremely brave ending and the terrific Left Behind side-story also brought the feels. So, when it came to The Last of Us Part 2, I was beyond excited. Fifty million hours later I was beyond disappointed. Don’t get me wrong, the millennial nailed it when she said it was a great exploration of the effects of grief and grey morality. But after spending the whole game switching between two strong female characters (literally, have you seen Abby’s arms?) and contrasting factional creeds, you have the final confrontation. They fight. And … they both live. And go their separate ways. The only real damage is Ellie losing a couple of fingers, and the game portrays the worst consequence of this as not being able to play guitar any more. Seriously? That’s the biggest drawback to being fingerless in a zombie apocalypse? The first game ended with Joel murdering an entire civilisation, the second ends with Ellie murdering one song on a guitar. It’s a scene you might have found in The Secret of Monkey Island. It’s hilarious. The Last of Us Part 2 leaves us with exactly the same non-ending as those original arcade games. Ellie and Abby will go on killing to keep their respective postapocalyptic factions going, both driven by the grief of murdered loved ones. They are both trapped, endlessly chasing ghosts. Sounds familiar… The millennial says this shows there are no winners when it comes to revenge. I say they want both protagonists alive for The Last of Us 3. It’s a cynical cop out. But then, The Last of Us Part 2 is a game that features the most cynical scene ever, where apropos of nothing, after genuinely bravura portrayals of women, transgender and gay characters, alpha female Abby suddenly gets rogered from behind by some guy. It happens out of nowhere. The game spends umpteen hours portraying progressive sexuality, and then it’s like some marketing man decided they needed to toss the incels a piece of red meat to stop them hate-bombing all over 4chan (which didn’t work). It is easily the most gratuitous bit of nudity I have ever seen in games, and I have played The Witcher 3. The rogerer in question even has a girlfriend. Who is pregnant. Way to shit on a sister, Abby. “It’s basically Pac-Man with gratuitous boobs,” I say to my eldest, who sighs and pours herself a large cup of coffee. This will be another long discussion.",Arts/Games,"Now that I’ve finally played The Last of Us, who wants to talk about that ending? | Dominik Diamond",https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/27/now-that-ive-finally-played-the-last-of-us-who-wants-to-talk-about-that-ending
1/27/2022,"Hi, Keith … What’s your favourite English expression? ClassicMacGruberI’m sure they meant to say Kief? Or maybe not? I get called Kief in England more than any other place. I met some young parents in about 2001 who had named their son Kiefer, but I’ve never met anyone called Kiefer that is my age. As for my favourite British expression, there’s “bit and bobs”, which is really sweet and reminds me of my grandma, and “Oi!” which is not technically British, but any time I go “Oi!” it stops the room. Does your twin sister have as many middle names as you? emzsam  I’m Kiefer William Frederick Dempsey George Rufus Sutherland. She’s Rachel Elizabeth Maria Teresa Dorothy Isabelle Sutherland. We’ve never gotten a straight answer from our father as to why he was so generous. I’ve always joked that he must have been in real debt and told people: “If you feed us on Tuesday, I’ll name my son after you”, and then extended the offer to my sister. How does being British affect your outlook on life? LarboIreland I have an innate desire to conquer the world. During your first appearance in The Simpsons, as an army colonel in the 18th season, Homer says: “Man, you’ve got an awesome voice!” Do you agree? francolfc I’m very grateful for my voice. I have benefitted genetically from my father who has got one of the most awesome voices of all time. He was doing the voiceover for these Volvo commercials and getting paid a lot more money than I originally thought. So, as a joke, I told his agent that I could do a really good Donald Sutherland for half the money. I don’t think my father thought it was very funny, but I thought it was hysterical. Has your father influenced your acting career choices? evandane It’s hard to think of another actor who’s been as prolific and made films as diverse as Ordinary People, Don’t Look Now, Fellini’s Casanova, Bertolucci’s 1900 and The Hunger Games. His influence was to make my career as diversified and interesting as possible, which he taught me by doing, not by saying, which was really cool. What do you remember of your grandfather, politician Tommy Douglas, who moved from Falkirk in Scotland and helped to bring universal healthcare to Canada? Haigin88From when I was six or seven, my sister and I would spend six weeks in the summer with my mother’s parents, my grandma and grandpa. I have incredibly fond memories of sitting in the gallery at the House of Commons in Ottawa, watching him give these great speeches. When he was finished, he would sneak up to the gallery and bring us a hotdog. I was aware of how important he was in Canadian politics, but he was also my grandpa. He was incredibly supportive. I was scholastically challenged and he told me not to get down on myself. When I was 14, he taught me to drive in a car park. He was one of the kindest people in my life. He died when I was 18, so I miss him very much. Do you feel more comfortable as a musician than an actor? sey_more_j No. You inhabit two very different things. As an actor, I’m inhabiting a character, so innately, it’s not comfortable because it’s not you. If I’m on stage and explaining to a room full of strangers that I wrote this song because I had a broken heart, and people start laughing … what’s plan B? You’re relying on the good faith of others, so that’s not very comfortable, either. I think it’s safe to say I’m pretty uncomfortable doing both. You’ve said you dislike watching your own movies and TV shows. How about your singing? emzsam When you’ve got 40, or 50 songs, at some point you’re going to start listening to your own stuff, just to remember it. When I’m watching a movie or a television show I’m in … it’s not that I hate it, but I have a very strong image of what I’m trying to create, and sometimes I don’t see what was in my imagination. Stand By Me was a perfect example. I really felt that I had not played that character properly. But people would come up to me and say otherwise, so I realised what is blocking me from enjoying my characters – and I know this sounds moronic – is that they look and sound like me. I read that Stand By Me worked so well because you genuinely intimidated the four younger actors. Was that conscious? HoppoI don’t know where that story comes from. I was 18, they were 12, so we didn’t hang out together. We were shooting in Oregon, and I was off in Portland doing … whatever I did at night. I remember running lines with River Phoenix. If their only contact with me was in the scenes, I understand why they might have felt a little threatened. But I certainly wasn’t going to bully a bunch of little children for a film. Did you ever meet that muscly singer who plays the saxophone in the beach party rock band in The Lost Boys? JSpicoliYeah – Tim Cappello. He was Tina Turner’s saxophone player. The Lost Boys had this great, deliberate, rock’n’roll soundtrack with Echo and the Bunnymen, Roger Daltrey … all these cool acts of the time. And he was one of them. How often do you pull out: “Maggots, Michael. You’re eating maggots” when you’re at a Chinese restaurant with friends? TamaIti It hasn’t occurred to me but now I might. You were very funny in 1992’s Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me Haigin88 Not on purpose! Do I get offered much comedy? No, I do not. It’s not that I can’t read the joke and find the punchline. I just get so nervous that nobody’s going to laugh that comedy is something that I’ve never coveted, and it’s avoided me, too. Would I like to be funny? My God, yeah. Whether or not I’m capable on cue might forever remain to be seen.What prompted you to move to TV when Netflix didn’t even exist? Istanbul_78Some television shows were already better than the movies. ER, NYPD Blue, The Sopranos, The West Wing, Sex and the City … 24 was right in there, so I got incredibly lucky. Stephen Hopkins, who directed the first season of 24, was a really good friend of mine, and helped convince me. Plus, the films I was being offered weren’t very good.Did you take on the role of Tom Kirkman in Designated Survivor just so Jack Bauer could finally get into the Oval Office? TheOracleNo1I wish I were that clever. I liked the idea of someone becoming president who didn’t go through the process. If you’re willing to put yourself through that process of becoming president, you’re probably not the person for the job. I liked the idea that – very much like in 1939’s Mr Smith Goes to Washington – someone is just pulled out of the crowd to become president who will approach politics purely from common sense. So, that’s the serious answer. It would’ve been very different if Jack Bauer had shown up, I would have let him in the Oval Office, and we would have talked about how much we thought we looked like each other. I’ve gotta ask, any chance of more Jack Bauer? TheSableHoundReturnsI’ve learned to say: never say never. But if the writers are going come up with a good idea, they better do it quick, because I’m slowing down. Time is catching up and the bones are getting brittle. Maybe they should reboot it with new characters and Jack Bauer somehow gets out of China and that storyline’s resolved. I’m open to all of it. 24 was one of my great experiences in life and if there’s a smart, intelligent way to finish it – or at least finish my involvement – I’m open to that. I’ve also had to learn how to respond to the name Jack, because, like the reader in the first question who got my name wrong, people just go: Jack! I was just settling in my seat on a plane and this lady leaned over and said: “I feel much safer now that you’re sitting next to me.” I took a beat and said: “I don’t know why. Everyone who sits next to me dies.” I was joking, but I’m not sure she knew how to take it.Why doesn’t Jack ever say goodbye to Chloe on the phone? Haigin88Everything’s way too urgent. With Jack Bauer, everything’s vocal. As Kiefer, I would say [takes sips of water]: “Ooh, I really would like that glass of water.” Jack Bauer would say [swigs water]: “I need that glass of water.” He never says goodbye but you will notice that he does say please and thank you, which was never written into the script. I don’t know what it is about television people, but they are incredibly impolite. So that was my big contribution.What’s your favourite item from Greggs? prometheus3 Plain sausage roll. I have people in the band and crew who get all complicated with steak this and bacon that … Ugh! Sausage roll, easy, done, in and out. The great thing is that it doesn’t matter if it’s been sitting there for six hours, it still tastes the same. Get the sausage roll, there will be zero disappointment.As proud owner of a 24 tattoo on my back, has a fan ever displayed any ink that has terrified you? Ajyates33No, not terrifying. I mean, I’ve got Mickey Mouse with a machine gun reading a book called How to Kill on my arm, but I think that’s cute and funny. Every tour, I get a tattoo at the end. I can’t think of a tattoo shop I’ve been in that hasn’t had The Lost Boys on the wall. If people have got a tattoo because they’ve enjoyed something I did: thank you very much.

1/27/2022,"It had been a while since Tom Rogic has been seen as an answer to Australia’s problems. Long a talisman for his club, Celtic, the playmaker has long been associated with the word “potential” when it comes to the national team. It is a potential that diminishes with each year he ages, as if he is destined never to fulfil it before his career is out. And yet, at the age of 29, something is stirring within Rogic. Not just in Scotland, where he is experiencing a reawakening under Ange Postecoglou. But also, it seems, with the Socceroos, for whom he was a standout at a time his team really need a standout.  After last month’s setbacks against Saudi Arabia and China a place at the 2022 World Cup is well and truly on the line for Graham Arnold’s side. Alex Ferguson would call this “squeaky bum time”, and it was incidental that his former Manchester United assistant René Muelensteen was head honcho in the dugout at AAMI Park (Arnold has Covid-19) as the Socceroos set about rectifying their precarious situation. Specifically Rogic, who had an assist and a goal before half-time and was in pleasing touch throughout a 4-0 result over 90 minutes during which Joel King and Marco Tilio made their international debuts and Fran Karačić was impressive. “Can’t be more pleased,” said Muelensteen. “We knew it was going to be a challenge but [I was] pleased with the quality we showed at times. Most importantly [we got] the three points. We knew we needed to keep going. “We were on constant touch with [Graham Arnold]. I know he would have been sat there and enjoyed the performance.” In truth the goals could have been even plentiful against a Vietnam side who are now none from seven in this stage of qualifying and have conceded 12 goals. Here the visitors set up to defend stoutly and threw in the odd heart-fluttering transition and grew in confidence as the contest entered the final half-hour, during which half-time substitute Nguyễn Công Phượng would certainly have scored but not for Mat Ryan’s lightening-quick reflexes. In the end, despite some vocal Vietnamese support among the 27,740 in attendance, the home side held firm. Which was just as well, because they must beat Oman next Tuesday in Muscat to avoid the significantly more challenging play-off route to Qatar. A hamstring injury has kept Rogic out of action for Australia since last October’s 2-1 loss to Japan, but he clearly knew what was at stake from stake from the kick-off, when he prodded home a cute team transition after 20 seconds played only for the goal to be disallowed after Jackson Irvine was deemed by the VAR to have impeded the goalkeeper. The 30th minute marked the moment the scoreboard first flicked over, after Rogic popped a lovely ball to an unmarked Jamie Maclaren at the far post. Maclaren’s head enjoyed the glory that time, but Rogic had his own in first-half stoppage-time when Mathew Leckie slipped him a neat pass. The intensity picked up after the break as thunder and lightning overhead sparked something in Vietnam, with Nguyễn Quang Hải particularly lively. Though he and side tried, any glimmer of hope it might come to something was snuffed by Australia’s third. A long ball upfield from Ryan found Craig Goodwin, who hurtled onto it and dinked over the head of the onrushing Bùi Tấn Trường for his first international goal. “Very rewarding, kind of lost for words to be honest,” Goodwin said afterwards. “For me personally, it’s a great moment but there’s a lot of emotion in it. It’s a very rewarding feeling for me and my family as well. All credit to Vietnam. The second half they came out and created some chances.” Goodwin then helped fellow substitute Riley McGree seal the deal, feeding him the ball for a forceful low strike. Tilio almost scored himself at the death in a half-shot, half-slide that washed across the face of goal but did not quite tuck inside the far post.",Sport/Football,Tom Rogic helps Socceroos return to winning ways in crunch World Cup qualifier,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/27/tom-rogic-returns-to-help-socceroos-return-to-winning-ways-in-world-cup-qualifying
1/27/2022,"As the 2000s turned into the 2010s, Anaïs Mitchell seemed an easy artist to peg. Her career was plodding along in unassuming style, somewhere in the region where country and folk meet alt-rock. She had well-reviewed albums released on her own label, sessions for the Bob Harris show on Radio 2 and NPR’s Tiny Desk, support slots with Bon Iver. That was before she developed a Greek mythology-themed song from her 2007 album The Brightness into a small-scale musical called Hadestown, which turned into an album featuring Justin Vernon and Ani DiFranco – a sort of Pitchfork-friendly equivalent of the all-star concept albums that Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice used to drum up interest in Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita. That begat an off-Broadway production, which in turn begat a Broadway production, which won eight Tony awards.  Its unexpected success leaves Mitchell in a curious position. A feted Broadway writer, she is apparently planning another musical, but her eponymous seventh solo album – her first of original material in 10 years – sees her picking up where she left off as a singer-songwriter. Or more-or-less: the success of Hadestown means there’s substantially more media interest than before, and her cottage industry label Wilderland has been junked for a deal with BMG. But that notwithstanding, Anaïs Mitchell is an album for which the adjective “unassuming” might have been invented. The sound is gently polished and the songs richly melodic enough to bear comparison with Taylor Swift in downhome mode (both Mitchell and Swift contributed vocals to Justin Vernon and Aaron Dessner’s last album as Big Red Machine), but the whole enterprise is noticeably low-key. Around Mitchell’s acoustic guitar are delicate shimmers of tremolo-heavy guitar or electric piano; little smears of electronics so subtly placed you barely notice them first time around; the occasional sax solo courtesy of Bon Iver sideman Michael Lewis, sprawling gracefully in a way that recalls the same instrument’s use on Nick Drake’s Bryter Layter, as well as Lewis’s work on Gayngs’ small-hours soft rock-inspired album Relayted. Even the drums are gently tapped: rimshots rather than snares; brushes and soft mallets rather than drumsticks. That the musical scenery is shot in soft focus draws the listener’s attention to Mitchell’s distinctive voice – as you might be keen to do if you’d spent the past decade concentrating on other people singing your songs. Meanwhile, the songs are evidently personal, which also might appeal if you’d spent the past decade concentrating on telling a story for the stage. The opening track, Brooklyn Bridge, explores the perennial thrill of approaching Manhattan by car at night. But the rest of the album shifts its gaze to Mitchell’s home town in Vermont, and is suffused with childhood memories. On the gently insistent Revenant, she rummages through a deceased relation’s box of keepsakes. Backroads is filled with hazy recollections of teenage parties and old romances. Even when it isn’t specifically about Mitchell’s home town – to which she relocated when Covid hit – the album feels nostalgic: On Your Way recounts a fellow musician’s passing, smartly turning the title into a reflection on both the start of his career and his death. These are concise, tightly written songs, skilfully decked out with sharp lines and unexpected key changes. The whole album is over and done in barely half an hour. A couple of weak spots – Now You Know, and the put-down-your-smartphone whinge of Real World – shoot by so fast you barely notice them. Her voice flits from breathy to tough, which fits her lyrical style perfectly. Too smart to wallow in sentimentality, Mitchell has a habit of suddenly shifting emotional gear mid-song. Backroads goes from Nashville-esque stuff about small town life (where even the stars at night “seem to say you’re one of us”) to sharply contrasting the treatment her friends received from the police when they were nicked for underage drinking with that meted out to another acquaintance pulled in for a minor driving offence: “Somebody thought he didn’t look right / They might as well have said that he didn’t look white”. Little Big Girl turns from an examination of ageing (“You grew up by mistake, you grew up by surprise”) into a withering condemnation of the male gaze. And it happens again on closer The Words, which starts out fretting about life going on outside when you’re trapped indoors working, and ends with Mitchell apologising to her husband for thinking about lyrics when she should be in the moment. Clearly a lot of thought gone into this album. It isn’t a strident statement built to sweep the boards at awards ceremonies but, in its own way, it’s as striking a demonstration of its author’s songwriting abilities as Hadestown. It’s the work of an artist who has succeeded on a big stage now working in miniature, sweating the small stuff with utterly charming results.
