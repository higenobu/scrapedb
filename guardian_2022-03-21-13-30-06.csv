3/21/2022,"Republicans who support Vladimir Putin over the Russian invasion of Ukraine are “lonely voices” in the party, Mitch McConnell said. But the Senate minority leader dodged an invitation to say such Republicans should be ejected from the party or at least face disciplinary measures. Support or admiration for Putin flecks the Republican party. Donald Trump, the former president who maintains a firm grip on the GOP, has called the Russian leader “smart” while condemning the war in Ukraine. Madison Cawthorn and Marjorie Taylor Greene, far-right members of Congress and enthusiastic Trump supporters, have made controversial comments of their own. Cawthorn has called Volodymyr Zelinskiy, the president of Ukraine who addressed Congress last week, a “thug” and his government “incredibly evil”. Greene has said the US should support Ukraine financially in a war it cannot win. Such rhetoric echoes that from influential voices on the US right prominently including Tucker Carlson, a primetime Fox News host reportedly praised by Russian government sources. On CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday, McConnell was asked about what the anti-Trump congresswoman Liz Cheney has called the “Putin wing of the Republican party”. The Kentucky senator was asked: “Is there any room in the Republican party for this rhetoric and why isn’t there more discipline? “Well, there’s some lonely voices out there that are in a different place,” McConnell said. “But looking at Senate Republicans, I can tell you that I would have had I been the majority leader put this Ukraine supplemental [aid package] up by itself” instead of being included in a government funding bill. “I think virtually every one of my members would have voted for it,” McConnell added. “The vast majority of the Republican party writ large, both in the Congress and across the country, are totally behind the Ukrainians and urging [Joe Biden] to take these steps quicker. To be bolder. “So, there may be a few lonely voices off the side. I wouldn’t pay much attention to them.” Some of McConnell’s fellow Republican leaders, it seems, do not. On Friday Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader in the House, was asked about Cawthorn’s remark about Zelinskiy. “Madison is wrong,” McCarthy said. “If there’s any thug in this world, it’s Putin.” McCarthy also said he supported Cawthorn’s bid for re-election. He is not supporting Cheney in the same endeavor. After all, the Wyoming congresswoman faced rare party discipline, losing a leadership role, after she joined the January 6 committee, investigating the attack on Congress by Trump supporters. McCarthy has endorsed Cheney’s opponent.",News/US news,Mitch McConnell: Republicans who support Putin ‘lonely voices’ in party,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/21/mitch-mcconnell-republicans-who-support-putin-lonely-voices
3/21/2022,"Environment groups have called on the federal government to rule out the use of explosives and guns loaded with “bean bag” rounds to scare seals at a proposed salmon farming trial in commonwealth waters off the north-west coast of Tasmania. Under Tasmanian laws, the companies are allowed to use underwater explosives, known as “seal crackers”, to deter predators at farms in state waters. Other authorised measures include shooting seals with fabric coated plastic shells containing lead shot, known as bean bag rounds and darts with blunt tips known as “scare caps”. Official documents show some seals have been killed. Conservationists expressed alarm that the federal government may allow similar measures during a three-year trial in commonwealth waters to be overseen by the Blue Economy Cooperative Research Centre (CRC), a government-funded not-for-profit company that lists the salmon companies Tassal, Petuna and Huon Aquaculture as partners. Seals in commonwealth waters are protected under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act. It is an offence to kill, injure or move them without a permit. “The minister for environment must ban all cruel seal deterrents,” said Bec Howarth, a fish farm and marine campaigner with the Bob Brown Foundation. The foundation opposes the trial, describing it as a “sea grab”. The federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, referred questions about the use of explosives and other deterrents in the offshore trial to the assistant minister for forestry and fisheries, Tasmanian senator Jonathan Duniam. Duniam said the offshore salmon farming operation was still being planned. “Should that process identify a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance under the [EPBC] Act it would be referred through the appropriate channel,” he said. After the passage of amendments to fisheries legislation through the Tasmanian parliament two weeks ago, the state government is seeking federal approval to allow it to grant and manage permits in commonwealth waters adjacent to Tasmania. Under a September 2021 memorandum of understanding (MOU), the Tasmanian and federal governments agreed to amend state and commonwealth legislation to facilitate the development of an offshore industry. Tasmania’s minister for primary industries and water, Guy Barnett, did not rule out the use of underwater explosives and other deterrents in the trial. “Animal welfare has always been and will remain very important,” Barnett said. “There is a seal management framework already in place and animal welfare guidelines must be complied with.” Documents provided to Environment Tasmania last year under the Right to Information Act revealed that in the three years to the end of January 2021, the three salmon companies had used underwater explosives 75,339 times to scare seals away from fish farm operations. The documents also revealed severe injuries and deaths of seals at or near fish farms. In a separate document, the department estimated there had been 70 seal deaths at salmon farms between January 2018 and May 2021. In may cases the cause was unknown but entanglement in netting was the most common factor identified. In one document released under RTI and reported by the ABC, a wildlife biologist from the state environment and primary industries department wrote that salmon company estimates of seal deaths due to the use of approved deterrents were “probably a large underestimate”. Deterrent devices were the primary cause of several seal deaths. The Tasmanian government has refused to ban the shooting of seals and the use of underwater explosives but in some cases the salmon companies have sought to reduce their reliance on the practices. Huon Aquaculture has not used seal crackers or bean bag rounds since August 2018, but continues to use scare caps. In response to detailed questions it pointed to the information on its website about wildlife deaths. Tassal’s senior manager for responsible business, Angela Williamson, said the company had spent $90m on “world leading exclusion infrastructure”, and as a result its use of bean bag rounds and seal crackers had dropped by 80% and 90% respectively in the 2021 financial year. The company stopped using scare caps in 2020. “We have designated wildlife officers on sites that support the monitoring and mitigation of wildlife interactions,” Williamson said. “Our deterrent users are trained, abide by our wildlife policies, and adhere to our regulatory and internal reporting systems.” The company did not respond to a request for the number of seal crackers and bean bag rounds used. Petuna says on its website that it uses deterrents against seals. It did not respond to a question about what specific measures it uses. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Jilly Middleton, a marine campaigner for Environment Tasmania, said she was “deeply concerned” that allowing the use of existing measures against seals offshore “would likely lead to an increase in animal welfare breaches”. “The salmon industry needs independent observers and real-time, whole-farm footage going to a regulator who’ll actually regulate, whether it’s near-shore or not,” Middleton said. Right-to-Information advocate Rick Snell, an honorary associate professor in law at the University of Tasmania, said he was concerned the MOU between the governments did little to ensure public transparency. One clause says the state and federal governments will not make any public statement about “details of activities undertaken” unless both parties agreed in writing. An exception is if one of the parties is legally required to disclose information. “Unfortunately, it does place a pro-secrecy frame or response attitude over the activities of the parties in this area,” Snell said.

3/21/2022,"A fishing trip in New Zealand has ended in tragedy, with four people dead and one passenger still missing after their boat sank during wild weather. The rescue operation began on Sunday evening after a charter fishing vessel activated an emergency beacon off the North Island’s North Cape. A helicopter was first on scene at the remote location, arriving at about 11.40pm but by 2.30am the boat had sunk. Search and rescue crews winched five people to safety and transported them to Kaitāia hospital, but five passengers remained missing. Rescue operations were hampered as thunderstorms, swells and torrential downpours battered the region overnight, Maritime New Zealand spokesperson Nick Burt told RNZ. Two bodies were recovered by rescue helicopter on Monday morning, with another two recovered by rescue boats, police said. Rescue crews in the air, on the water and on shore were still searching for the final missing passenger, in an area covering about 300 sq nautical miles. The defence force sent an Orion aircraft and the navy ship HMNZS Taupō to assist the efforts. “This is a significant rescue operation, with a number of agencies working together in the search,” Burt said. “The weather conditions are more favourable today and we are completely focused on the search and rescue for the two people unaccounted for.” Winds in the area on Sunday afternoon would have reached about 65km/h before easing off late in the evening, while waves would have been up to 2.5 metres, MetService meteorologist David Miller told Stuff. The New Zealand Herald reported that the boat was an Enchanter Fishing Charters vessel named Enchanter – a 17m-long vessel designed to operate in offshore New Zealand waters. The company was established in 1995. The charter boat left from its base in Mangonui in the Far North for a five-day fishing trip, the Herald said, and it is understood that the skipper, a crew hand, and a group from Auckland were onboard. Iwi leader Penetaui Kleskovic told the Herald it was “a dark day for the peninsula community”. “Condolences and thoughts with all the whānau [family] affected.”",News/World news,"Four dead, one missing after New Zealand fishing boat sinks in bad weather",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/four-dead-one-missing-after-new-zealand-fishing-boat-sinks-in-bad-weather
