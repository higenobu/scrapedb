4/10/2022,"The Morrison government has promised more than $5.6bn in discretionary grants to projects across the country as part of a massive $28bn pre-election spending spree, with almost half directed to key marginal seats. A Guardian Australia analysis of major party spending commitments from January to March this year shows Queensland as the biggest beneficiary of commitments from the Coalition and Labor, with the state a key battleground for parties to form government. As the official election campaign kicked off on Sunday, with an election to be held on Saturday 21 May, Guardian Australia is tracking the funding commitments of both major parties and highlighting pork-barrelling in marginal electorates. The breakdown by electorate of funding promises so far shows Labor has promised $756m for local projects over the same period – with more than 80% directed towards target marginal electorates, and just 2.4% promised for safe seats. The party’s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has promised to “trim” discretionary funding programs if Labor wins office, but has not gone so far as to commit to abolishing them. Of the total $2.5bn that the opposition has committed over the past three months, at least $1.1bn is allocated to Queensland, targeting the marginal seats of Leichhardt and Flynn. The Coalition has committed a total of more than $28bn in just three months across all major government funding streams, with almost $14bn directed to projects in Queensland. This is more than the funding directed to Victoria and NSW combined. Of the total funding, $5.6bn is for projects targeting single electorates. About half of this – 49% – will be directed to projects in marginal seats, accounting for $2.8bn, with 25% going to those held by Labor. While this means $2.9bn is also committed to safe or fairly safe seats with a margin above 6%, just $290m, or about 10%, of that will go towards Labor-held electorates. The total government spend from discretionary funds to safe Labor seats is just $158m – less than 3% of all funding committed, compared with more than $2bn, or 35%, spent in safe Coalition seats. Of the total $28bn committed by the Coalition since January, the largest projects include funding for large state-based road and infrastructure work, such as the north-south corridor in South Australia, the Brisbane to Sunshine Coast rail extension, the intermodal terminal package for inland rail, and more than $300m for roads in regional Tasmania where the Coalition is targeting three marginal seats. A separate Guardian Australia analysis of the government’s budget infrastructure package shows that only 15% of the funded projects were recommended as priorities by Infrastructure Australia, with more than half of the $6.4bn for single electorate projects going to marginal seats. The Coalition’s targeted funding includes $352m for the Milton Ulladulla bypass in the seat of Gilmore, which the Coalition is hoping it can win off Labor’s Fiona Phillips. The Labor party is also spending up in the NSW south coast seat, pledging $7.5m for a new library, $22m for a birthing centre and $25m for an emergency operations centre in Moruya. Seats in Western Australia are being targeted by the Coalition, with $2.1bn in rail and road spending allocated to projects that will benefit commuters in the outer suburbs of Perth, where the government is hoping it can hang on to the seats of Swan, Pearce and Hasluck. It has also committed $25m for a new bridge over the Swan River, which was announced by Morrison and the Liberal candidate for the seat, Kristy McSweeney. Labor has also been lavishing spending commitments in the seat of Swan, committing $5.3m for a new playground, $2m for a new commercial kitchen at the local Tafe and $250,000 for lighting at the Redcliffe juniors football ground. In Pearce, Labor has promised to spend $5,500 for a new computer and furniture for the Wanneroo senior citizens association, and $15m for the Neerabup Industrial Precinct. Labor’s largest overall commitments over the past three months include $600m for the Paradise Dam announced in the Queensland seat of Flynn, $163m for reef conservation announced in the Cairns-based seat of Leichhardt and $125m for a road duplication in the seat of Corangamite. It has committed another $100m to local projects in Flynn, held by the Coalition on an 8.7% margin, including $15m for an aquatic centre, $15m for a marine research centre, $2.8m for an allied health clinic and $2m for an industry hub. The Coalition has committed $130m to projects in Flynn, including $45m for an alumina production facility near Gladstone, $10m for a new rural health department at James Cook University and a combined $74m for four separate road projects. In Boothby, held by the Coalition on a 1.4% margin, Labor has committed $3m for a community hall upgrade, $1.6m for a park in Blackwood, $544,000 for a tennis club redevelopment and $135,000 for a reserve in Warradale. The government – which is hoping a new moderate-aligned candidate, Rachel Swift, can hang on to the seat after the departure of incumbent Nicolle Flint – promised $200m in the budget to fix a tram line intersection. In Tasmania, Labor has so far targeted spending at the marginal seats of Lyons, Braddon and Bass, spending a combined $55m on local projects, including $50,000 for a playgroup in Invermay, $500,000 for an RSL redevelopment, $500,000 for a jobs hub and $25m for a Devonport sports centre. Northern Tasmania is also a focus for the Coalition, with the government committing $100m for the eastern Tasmania tourism drive in Lyons, $24m for the Bell Bay line reconnection in Bass and $14.4m for a rail hub in Braddon. Labor holds a notional 69 seats, so needs a net gain of four seats from the Coalition to hold more seats, and a net seven seats for majority government. After the most recent redistribution of electorate boundaries, the Coalition has just 75 of 151 seats, so needs to win seats to retain majority government. During this election campaign, Guardian Australia is monitoring the distribution of election promises and monetary announcements in real time, tracking how much money goes towards marginal seats, and how this compares to what each seat would receive if the funding was shared equally.

4/10/2022,"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has warned his country “does not have time to wait” while pushing for an oil embargo on Russia in his latest national address. He also said he is committed to pressing for peace despite Russian attacks on civilians that have stunned the world, and renewed his plea for countries to send more weapons ahead of an expected surge in fighting in the country’s east. Zelenskiy said his country is ready for a tough battle with Russian forces amassing in the east of the country. “This will be a hard battle; we believe in this fight and our victory. We are ready to simultaneously fight and look for diplomatic ways to put an end to this war.” The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, pledged a major new infusion of British arms and financial aid during a surprise trip to Kyiv on Saturday. Johnson said the UK and its partners and allies will provide support so that “Ukraine will never be invaded again”. The UK confirmed it will send 120 armoured vehicles and new anti-ship missile systems. Johnson praised Zelenskiy’s “resolute leadership and the invincible heroism”. “Putin’s monstrous aims are being thwarted,” Johnson said. The reputations of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his government have been “permanently polluted” by war crimes against civilians in Ukraine, he added. Russia’s withdrawal from northern Ukraine has left evidence of “disproportionate targeting” of civilians, mass graves, the use of hostages as human shields, according to the latest British intelligence report. The report also claimed Russian forces continue to use improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to inflict casualties, lower Ukrainian morale and restrict freedom of movement. Five people have been killed in east Ukraine shelling, according to the Donetsk governor. Four were reported killed in the city of Vugledar, and one in the town of Novomikhaylovka. In the town of Borodianka, north-west of Kyiv, rescue teams sorted through the rubble of houses destroyed in Russian bombardments, looking for those missing. Heavy Russian bombardment has razed residential buildings and Ukrainian authorities are attempting search, clear-up and, hopefully, some rescue activities. Ukraine carried out a prisoner exchange with Russia on Saturday, the third such swap since the start of the war, with 12 soldiers confirmed to be coming home, the Ukrainian deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, wrote online. A total of 4,553 people were evacuated from Ukrainian cities through humanitarian corridors on Saturday, fewer than the 6,665 who escaped on Friday, Vereshchuk said. Ten humanitarian corridors to evacuate people from embattled areas across the country had been agreed on Saturday. The European Commission is pledging €1bn to support Ukraine and countries receiving refugees fleeing the war following Russia’s invasion, said the commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen. The Czech Republic has delivered tanks, multiple-rocket launchers, howitzers and infantry fighting vehicles to Ukraine among military shipments that have reached hundreds of millions of dollars and will continue, two Czech defence sources told Reuters. The Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, met Zelenskiy earlier on Saturday, following a visit to the city of Bucha to the north-west of Kyiv, where mass civilian graves and street killings by Russian forces were discovered last week. Russia has reorganised the command of its battle operations in Ukraine, installing a new general with extensive experience in Russian operations in Syria, according to a western official. The commander of Russia’s southern military district, Gen Alexander Dvornikov, now leads the invasion, the source told the BBC, adding: “We would expect the overall command and control to improve.”",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 46 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/10/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-46-of-the-invasion
4/10/2022,"Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, has called a general election for May, hoping for a second victory against the odds as he faces accusations of lying and bullying from within his own party. An informal campaign has been under way for weeks, but Morrison pulled the trigger on the election on Sunday, with opinion polls showing his personal popularity plummeting and his party losing ground with voters. In a highly produced video released on Saturday, Morrison admitted his government had not been perfect but appealed to voters to stick with the status quo, saying the ruling conservative Coalition had kept unemployment low, Covid deaths down and the economy stable during the pandemic. Australians will head to the polling booths on 21 May to choose between the governing Coalition and Labor. The Coalition is made up of the conservative Liberal party and its junior partner the National party, ostensibly representing the regions. Morrison became the Liberal leader, and therefore the prime minister, in 2018 after a messy leadership challenge. Thanks to what the Pentecostal true believer described as a “miracle”, he went on to win the 2019 election, despite opinion polls pointing to a victory for the opposition Labor party. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, who has been in the job since the opposition’s surprise loss in 2019, describes himself as a working-class kid, raised by a single mother in a council flat. Albanese hails from the party’s left faction and the government has sought to paint him as a radical. Morrison is keen to draw attention to Australia’s economic recovery from the pandemic. The party’s traditional objections to high debt and deficit have been flattened by the need for fiscal stimulus during Covid-19. The prime minister and his treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, recently released a budget that unabashedly targeted hip-pocket relief, with short-term tax offsets, cash handouts and fuel price cuts to deal with cost of living pressures. Albanese used his budget response to also address cost of living issues. But his focus was on aged care – which was in a dire situation in Australia even before Covid. Albanese is also promising wages growth and more spending on health, education and childcare, with the Coalition questioning where the money will come from. To retain office, Morrison will need to overcome lingering resentment over the pandemic response, including a slow vaccine “strollout” and delays in accessing rapid antigen tests. He has also been criticised for his response to Australia’s devastating floods and, before them, deadly bushfires. Despite attempts by the Coalition to paint Labor as “soft” on national security, it is traditionally a bipartisan area. The historic defence deal struck by Morrison with the US and the UK, Aukus, has been welcomed by Labor. Morrison is also facing claims – which he strongly denies – that he used a competitor’s Lebanese heritage to undermine him and win preselection for his seat in the south of Sydney 15 years ago. He has also been accused of being an “autocrat” and a “bully” by an outgoing senator and last year it emerged that his own deputy prime minister had called him “a hypocrite and a liar”. Recent opinion polls suggest Labor is ahead of the Coalition. The latest Guardian Essential poll puts Labor on 50% and the Coalition on 45% – with 5% undecided. But the path to victory is never straightforward. To form a majority government, a party must secure 76 seats in the 151-seat House of Representatives. Heading into the election, the Coalition holds 76 seats, Labor holds 69, and the remainder are held by independents and minor parties. To win government, Labor needs to pick up seven seats while not losing any. If neither party wins a majority, a pact would have to be made with the Greens or independents to form government. Because voting is compulsory in Australia, parties do not have to worry about whether people will vote, only whom they will vote for – and how preferences will flow under the preferential voting system, where voters number the box of each candidate on their ballot paper in order of preference. This allows for a form of “instant run-off” if no candidate wins 50% plus one vote in the first round of ballot paper counting. Action, or the lack of it, on climate change has caused division within both the Coalition and Labor. Enter the “teals”, a group of independents appealing to blue-blood Liberal voters who want climate change action more in line with that proposed by the Greens. These predominantly female candidates – many backed by the Climate 200 pressure group – are mostly targeting Coalition-held seats. The latest Essential poll shows the teals (and others) on about 5% of the primary vote. But Dr Jill Sheppard, from the Australian National University’s School of Politics and International Relations, says their impact will not necessarily come from winning seats. “They’re talking about issues the main parties aren’t – like climate change,” she says. “The most important material effect of these independents, apart from setting the agenda, is that they’ll drag resources from the major parties. That’s where it’ll hurt. It opens up another front.”",News/Australia news,"After fires, floods and a pandemic, Australians once again head to national election",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/10/after-fires-floods-and-a-pandemic-australians-once-again-head-to-national-election
