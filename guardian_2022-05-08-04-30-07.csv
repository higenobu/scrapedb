5/8/2022,"Frustration is mounting within the shadow cabinet over Durham police’s decision to re-examine lockdown breach allegations against Keir Starmer, amid claims it has robbed them of the chance to herald Labour’s progress at the local elections. Senior figures have already been dragged into debates over the conduct of their leader as they attempted to argue that Labour’s gains signalled it was on the road to building an election-winning programme. One Labour frontbencher was confronted over whether politicians should drink alcohol during working hours in the wake of the claims, while another described the allegations against Starmer as a “smear” designed to coincide with the elections. Shadow cabinet figures privately acknowledge the issue has become a frustration that could drag on for weeks. Durham police waited until polls had closed before announcing on Friday that they were reopening an investigation into a claim that Starmer broke lockdown rules in April last year. The force had previously dismissed the claims, but said it had been handed “significant new information”. Labour’s political opponents have leapt on a video that appeared to show Starmer drinking a beer while on the Durham visit. Labour has also conceded that deputy leader Angela Rayner was at the event, having previously denied her presence. The police decision has had an impact on the political fallout from the local elections. While Labour has not made huge gains in its former heartlands lost to the Conservatives, it made progress in swathes of the Tories’ southern heartlands. In a sign of annoyance among Labour’s top team, Jo Stevens, the shadow Welsh secretary, said she believed the allegations were “a kind of smear that’s been going on to time with the local elections to try and hold up a Tory party that is so badly damaged by the behaviour of the prime minister”. Asked if Starmer would resign if he received a fine, she told Times Radio: “If we get to that situation – which I think is extremely unlikely on the basis that Durham police have already investigated this complaint and found that no rules have been broken – I’m sure Keir will make a statement at that point.” Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said he had “absolute faith and confidence” that Starmer had done nothing wrong. The incident has muddied the water over Labour’s attack on Boris Johnson for a lockdown breach fine. Shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell faced questions on Friday night over whether she ever drank alcohol at work events. “No, not really,” she said. “What you have to understand about our lifestyles is there’s very few occasions when we’re not working, we don’t have 9-5 jobs. We work very late into the evening and start very early in the morning, seven days a week … there is a serious sort of blurring of lines in that.” Last night, an internal Labour memo emerged documenting the arrangements for the event and the plan to order a curry. Critics of Starmer said that the note, published by the Mail on Sunday, undermined Labour’s defence of the event because it showed it had been pre-arranged and that no work was done after the meal. However, legal experts questioned its significance. Barrister and lockdown rules expert Adam Wagner said: “The fact it was pre-arranged with social distancing guidelines makes it more likely to be reasonably necessary not less.” Sources said that such notes often failed to keep up with events and that the takeaway had been late. While Starmer’s team remains confident that no rules have been broken, the police investigation is politically difficult for him. He has previously called for Boris Johnson to resign when the Met opened an investigation into alleged lockdown parties, even before Johnson had been issued with a fine. A Labour spokesperson said: “Keir was working, a takeaway was made available in the kitchen, and he ate between work demands. No rules were broken.” Education secretary Nadhim Zahawi yesterday accused Starmer of hypocrisy. Starmer said on Friday: “I was working, I stopped for something to eat. No party, no breach of the rules. The police, obviously, have got their job to do, we should let them get on with it, but I’m confident no rules were broken.”",News/Politics,"Starmer beer claim ‘smears’ could drag on for months, top Labour figures warn",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/07/starmer-beer-claim-smears-could-drag-on-for-months-top-labour-figures-warn
5/8/2022,"Northern Ireland has slipped into political crisis after Sinn Féin’s triumph in the assembly election triggered calls for a referendum on a united Ireland and the Democratic Unionist party vowed to block the formation of a new power-sharing executive at Stormont. Jubilant Sinn Féin supporters celebrated across the region on Saturday when final vote counts confirmed a historic victory that turned the former IRA mouthpiece into the biggest party, with the right to nominate the first minister. Sinn Féin won 29% of the first preference vote and will be the biggest party in the Stormont assembly, a seismic moment for a state that was designed a century ago to have a permanent unionist majority. The party once led by Gerry Adams seeks to abolish what it considers an illegitimate entity and shuns the term Northern Ireland, instead referring to “the North”, presenting an existential challenge to the UK. Sinn Féin’s MPs boycott Westminster. In a coded reference to Irish unification, Michelle O’Neill, the party’s deputy president, and the first minister elect, said: “It’s a defining moment for our politics and for our people. Today ushers in a new era which I believe presents us all with an opportunity to reimagine relationships in this society on the basis of fairness, on the basis of equality, and on the basis of social justice, irrespective of religious or social backgrounds.” It was time for Ireland north and south to discuss a new, shared island, she said. “Let’s have a healthy debate about what our future looks like.” Sinn Féin’s leader, Mary Lou McDonald, had a message for unionists: “Don’t be scared. The future is bright for all of us.” She added there was a collective responsibility to get the government “up and running quickly”. “This is not a time for theatrics, this is not a time for playing games this is the time for grown-up sensible partnership politics, that’s what people want,” she said. “The idea, at a time of a cost of living crisis, that people would stand on the sidelines and allow people to struggle, and struggle badly, for us is unthinkable, so we would appeal to everybody to take stock.” Sinn Féin has been in power at Stormont with other parties for 15 years and has promised to make the region work – but it sent a stark message to Boris Johnson’s government that a referendum on a united Ireland was now on the agenda. The party’s soaring popularity in the Republic of Ireland, where it leads the opposition in the Dublin parliament, will add to No 10’s alarm. Under the Good Friday agreement the secretary of state for Northern Ireland is supposed to call a referendum if it appears likely a majority wants a united Ireland. Polls show most people favour staying within the UK but Sinn Féin hopes to change the tide within five to 10 years. Its victory set up a clash with the DUP, which lost its pre-eminence and slumped to second place, with 21.3% of the first preference vote, a humiliation that underscored a wider crisis engulfing unionism in the wake of the Northern Ireland protocol, which put a post-Brexit trade border in the Irish Sea. The DUP leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, said on Saturday he would refuse to join a new devolved administration until the UK government “dealt with” the protocol. That would paralyse Stormont, which would be run by a caretaker administration, and puts pressure on the prime minister to amend the protocol to end the stalemate. The impasse is expected to last weeks if not months and possibly lead to a new election. Last week, in a sign of uncertainty in the government over how to proceed, ministers in London made clear they would not be introducing a bill in this week’s Queen’s Speech giving them powers to override the protocol, having previously briefed they would do so. On Saturday, having seen her party increase its number of council seats in Scotland, despite having been in power for 15 years, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon said Sinn Féin’s performance in Northern Ireland had highlighted that there were now big questions around the future of the UK as a political entity. “There’s no doubt there are big fundamental questions being asked of the UK as a political entity right now,” Sturgeon declared. “They’re being asked here in Scotland, they’re being asked in Northern Ireland, they’re being asked in Wales and I think we’re going to see some fundamental changes to UK governance in the years to come and I am certain that one of those changes is going to be Scottish independence.” The renewed battle over Northern Ireland’s constitutional place in the union came despite a dramatic surge in support for the centrist Alliance, which soared to 13.5%, putting it in third place and showing the growing clout of a third bloc that eschews nationalist and unionist labels. Alliance deputy leader and MP Stephen Farry, said despite the Sinn Féin success, most voters had supported parties that wanted the protocol reformed or removed. He urged the DUP to work with the other parties to solve the issue rather than “plunge the UK into a new war with the EU”. Without a first minister and deputy first minister, the executive cannot function fully, with ministers limited to continuing but not making new policy, signing off budgets or introducing much needed health reforms. Senior DUP sources say they will seek an urgent summit with ministers in Downing Street to press home the message that their boycott could put the assembly on pause until Christmas. If no executive is formed the Northern Ireland secretary must call a new election, which must then be held within 12 weeks, pushing the chances of a full devolved government back to December.",News/Politics,Sinn Féin assembly victory fuels debate on future of union,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/07/sinn-fein-assembly-victory-fuels-debate-on-future-of-union
5/8/2022,"Michelle O’Neill and Mary Lou McDonald strode into the Magherafelt count centre on Saturday like republican royalty trailing a retinue of cheering admirers and activists, all eager to bask in this moment of Sinn Féin’s triumph. A road that arguably started in 1981, when the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands won a Westminster seat and set the party on an electoral path, led to this cavernous sports arena in County Derry, when the party that wants to abolish Northern Ireland became its biggest party. The Armalites long discarded, it was the ballot box alone that gave Sinn Féin victory in the assembly election. Francie Molloy, Sinn Féin’s MP for Mid Ulster, and a veteran activist, soaked up the scenes of rapture. “A lifetime waiting on this day,” he said. “It’s been a big change. Now we need to build what future Ireland will like.” O’Neill, the party’s deputy leader and designated first minister, immediately sought to calm those who fear the Sinn Féin victory will hasten the region’s exit from the UK and promised to focus on bread-and-butter concerns. However, she made a coded reference to the party’s push for a referendum on a united Ireland. “Today ushers in a new era, which I believe presents us all with an opportunity to reimagine relationships in this society,” she said. Asked for her message to unionism, McDonald, the party’s leader, replied: “Don’t be scared. The future is bright for all of us.” McDonald leads the opposition in the Dublin parliament and is widely seen as a taoiseach in waiting. As counting continued ahead of the allocation of final seats, it was clear that Sinn Féin, with 29% first preference votes, had overtaken the DUP, which won 21.3%, with two seats between them on Saturday afternoon. It meant the all-Ireland republican party would be entitled to nominate O’Neill as Northern Ireland’s first nationalist first minister. Taking to the podium to accept the formal declaration for the Mid Ulster constituency, O’Neill was distinctly non-triumphalist, promising to work for all sides. “My commitment is to make politics work. My commitment is to work through partnership, not division. People demand cooperation, people demand delivery,” she said, urging the DUP to “turn up for work on Monday” and put aside their protests about the Brexit protocol for now. “There is an urgency to restore an executive to start to put money back in people’s pockets, to start to fix the health service,” she said to hordes of press and a phalanx of Sinn Féin supporters. The scale of the party’s victory left unionists at some count centres visibly stunned. While the unionist vote was split three ways, it was “not utterly catastrophic for the DUP” said Jon Tonge, professor of politics at Liverpool University. But he added their “crown is lost” as they now must face an assembly where they will be the second-largest party in the mandatory power-sharing coalition. It was a sobering day for Doug Beattie, the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, who scraped in on the seventh count after offering a more liberal and progressive programme, which he believed would appeal to an emerging cohort of secular unionists less interested in the politics of green versus orange. Those votes siphoned off to the Alliance party, the other big winner in Thursday’s election, which saw a surge to 13.5% of first preferences and looked likely to double its previous total of eight seats. Those gains were largely at the expense of the UUP, the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP), which haemorrhaged support, and the Green party, whose leader Clare Bailey lost her seat. “It’s the Alliance hurricane,” said one party activist. The “baby of the house”, Eóin Tennyson, 23, the youngest elected MLA and the first ever Alliance representative for Upper Bann, captured the moment as he choked up making his first speech as an MLA. “I’ve always been told the politics in Northern Ireland ... would always be orange and green. I think that we have smashed that narrative,” he said. “I don’t really like the unionists or the nationalists. I’d like to see a party for Northern Ireland, not for division,” said first-time voter and engineering student Natasha Nesbitt, 19. “I feel Northern Ireland is quite behind on issues like abortion. I hope when my generation are older, Sinn Féin and the DUP will go down and others will go up.” Under power-sharing rules, Sinn Féin, the DUP and Alliance, and possibly other parties that may clear a threshold, have eight days to form a new executive, but they have up to 24 weeks to do so under new laws signed off in Westminster. The DUP leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, has already made the party’s position clear – it will not enter an executive until the protocol, the post-Brexit deal that puts a trade border in the Irish Sea, is reformed. It, in effect, puts Boris Johnson on notice: Stormont or the protocol. Without a first minister and deputy first minister, the executive cannot function fully, with ministers limited to continuing but not making new policy, signing off budgets or introducing much needed health reforms. Senior DUP sources say they will seek an urgent summit with Downing Street to press home the message their boycott can put the assembly on pause until Christmas. If no executive is formed the Northern Ireland secretary must call a new election, which in turn must be held within 12 weeks, pushing the chances of a full devolved government back to December. The DUP also faces another urgent dilemma. After a ban on double-jobbing, Donaldson will have to decide if he is to remain as an MP or take up his new seat as an MLA and force a byelection for Westminster.",News/Politics,‘A lifetime waiting for this day’: crowds celebrate historic Sinn Féin victory,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/07/a-lifetime-waiting-for-this-day-crowds-celebrate-historic-sinn-fein-victory
5/8/2022,"At what point does just one of those things become more than just one of those things? If Manchester City’s defeat to Real Madrid on Wednesday night were a one-off, it could be written off. What can you do about luck like that? If you have nine shots on target to the opposition’s none in the first 90 minutes and still lose 2-1 what, really, have you done wrong? Especially when you’ve dominated the first leg as City had done. But this keeps happening. Season after season, Pep Guardiola finds his teams dominating Champions League ties and losing. Bad luck follows him: the Icelandic volcano that forced Barcelona to take the bus to Milan in 2010, Fernando Llorente’s handled goal in 2019, Raheem Sterling missing an open net from six yards in 2020 … The pattern then becomes self-fulfilling: the more disappointment that accretes the greater the temptation for Guardiola to second-guess himself, and the more he must feel time’s breath upon his neck. Already 11 years have passed since his last Champions League title. That means even if he wins the competition next year, he will have recorded the third-longest gap between European Cup/Champions League titles by a manager (after Jupp Heynckes’s 15 years and Ernst Happel’s 13 – and neither of them spent such long periods in charge of clubs of such status). Few managers endure much more than a decade at the highest level. What to do then? Is this simply a case of the gods of football tormenting Guardiola? Or is there something deeper that links the near misses? The defeat he referred to after Wednesday’s exit was Barcelona’s against Chelsea in the 2012 semi-final. But that was especially freakish and stands alongside Bayern Munich’s away-goals exit to Atlético Madrid in not quite fitting the more general pattern. Each of the other eight pre-final defeats have been characterised by the sudden concession of a burst of goals that have turned the tie: with Barça, two in 13 minutes against Internazionale in 2010; with Bayern, three in 18 minutes against Madrid in 2014 and three in 17 against Barcelona in 2015; with City, two in eight against Monaco in 2017, three in 19 against Liverpool in 2018, two in four against Tottenham in 2019 and then three in nine against Madrid on Wednesday. That trend in itself is telling, suggesting that the very sophistication and subtlety of the Guardiola model can, in certain circumstances, count against it, that this team that seeks always to impose order cannot deal with rare outbreaks of chaos. The mechanism is so complex that when it misfires, it cannot easily be put right, a problem exacerbated by the fact that Guardiola’s method demands complete buy-in from his players. There are exceptions – Vincent Kompany most notably at City – but that means his squads tend to comprise what Zlatan Ibrahimovic mocked at Barça as “obedient little schoolboys”. And, while that can produce football of startling beauty and consistency, it can also mean a lack of leaders to seize a game when things begin to go awry: no Roy Keane, no Jordan Henderson, no Sergio Ramos. This is one of the beauties of football; it is a game replete with paradoxes and contingencies. There are few absolute rights or wrongs: a strength in one context becomes a vulnerability in another. But there is something else going on. In those eight exits, Guardiola’s sides let in 20 goals in clusters. Is there a pattern to them? Is there a type of goal they are prone to conceding when the usual flow is disrupted? Curiously, 16 of the 20 goals stemmed from moves down the opposition right and while 80% is a proportion high enough that it feels there must be some significance, it’s hard to see what it is. More explicable is that 14 of the 20 goals stemmed from turnovers. Transitions are always going to be where a team that plays a high line is most likely to come unstuck. That is why it is so essential that the press is right; that’s where the real fine-tuning of the mechanism comes into play. If the response to a goal being conceded is a level of panic, it’s perhaps no great surprise if that manifests in a breakdown in pressing discipline and an increased vulnerability to the counterattack. But that presents another of football’s paradoxes. Guardiola is acutely conscious of that tendency. That’s why he so often seems to invite defeat by overthinking; if thinking the normal amount repeatedly leads to implausible defeat, what alternative is there? Against Liverpool in 2018, Lyon in 2020 and Chelsea in 2021 he made unexpected changes designed to counter the effectiveness of the opponent’s counter. Each backfired, reducing City’s effectiveness; every step taken to avert his fate only causes it to come to pass. But having made changes and failed, the danger perhaps is of underthinking, of not making changes that are necessary, of reducing the complexity that has yielded such success. The biggest underthinking of all, perhaps, would be simply to sign a striker: after all, if City had converted more than one of their nine shots on target in the first 90 minutes at the Bernabéu, the game would have been out of reach even for this Madrid. But then again, with a more orthodox centre-forward, City probably wouldn’t be able to achieve the levels of control that generated those nine chances. And this is another of football’s paradoxes: with a striker City wouldn’t dominate games to the same extent, but also they wouldn’t need to. There is a curious sense in which the excess of control they habitually achieve renders them peculiarly susceptible to chaos. City were unfortunate on Wednesday; Guardiola sides generally have suffered extraordinary bad luck at key moments over the past 12 years. But there is also something inherent in his approach that seems to make them poor at responding to it. Guardiola has come to resemble a hero of classical tragedy, endlessly thwarted in his overriding ambition. But perhaps that is less to do with the fates than with the ineffable nature of football itself.",Sport/Football,Outbreaks of chaos expose fatal flaw that keeps denying Guardiola European glory | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/07/outbreaks-of-chaos-expose-fatal-flaw-that-keeps-denying-guardiola-european-glory
5/8/2022,"“Holding up”, wrote Denys Prokopenko, commander of Ukraine’s Azov regiment, in his latest WhatsApp message to his wife Kateryna from the besieged Azovstal steelworks in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Speaking via Zoom from Krakow, in eastern Poland, alongside three fellow wives and partners of soldiers living under the remorseless Russian shelling and infiltrating raids, Kateryna, 27, says she is doing everything she can think of to ensure the message at 10pm on Friday evening is not one of her husband’s last. It is now two weeks since the last Ukrainian defenders of the flattened city of Mariupol, in south-east Ukraine, withdrew to the sprawling complex of hot and fetid tunnels, along with thousands of terrified civilians, including children. Attempts to evacuate the non-combatants brokered by the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) have been successful, with a further 50 people reportedly taken out on Saturday. Last night Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Veheshchuk, said all women, children and older adults had been evacuated. For the 2,000 soldiers, 700 of whom are said to be injured, hope, however, is quickly dwindling, as has become cruelly clear from the irregular messages coming out of the works. “The last message was yesterday,” Kateryna says of the text from her 30-year-old husband. I said ‘Hold up, we will do everything in our power to save you.’” Russian barrages on strategic targets in the east and south of Ukraine have been intensifying in the lead-up to a historically significant day that has put many on edge, with several missiles striking the port city of Odesa on Saturday. The streets of Mariupol are also being cleared of debris before an expected 9 May Victory Day parade to mark the defeat of Nazi Germany by the Soviet Union – and the wiping out of the final redoubt of Ukrainian defenders of the devastated city. Kateryna, with the other military wives, is appealing for an internationally supervised extraction of the last of the soldiers suffering and dying in the steelworks. They won’t surrender, she says, as there is no chance of humane treatment. But she insists that the international community has a duty to prevent a massacre. “The conditions are awful, there is a complete blockade, they can’t deliver water, food or anything else,” Kateryna says. “They are sharing their supplies with the civilians that are also there. They can’t get any medical help. “Dead people are also there, because it’s important for our soldiers to save the bodies of their mates,” she says. “Refrigerators are barely working. So the conditions are awful. The bunkers are covered with mould, there are a few days left, they might just die from hunger. “We are inspired by the Dunkirk evacuation. We just need some brave countries that will evacuate our soldiers and civilians by sea or by air. But we need some brave countries to give Russia an ultimatum.” Yulia Fedosiuk, 29, whose husband Arseniy, 29, is a sergeant in the Azov regiment, says she received her last message via Telegram at the same time as Kateryna on Friday evening. “The way things are going, they have only five days left,” she says. “He also told me there are two wounded soldiers that may die in 24 hours. They have damaged organs, gangrene that has been getting worse for two months. There is no medication. Some of them have sepsis, necrosis and have lost a lot of blood.” The Azov regiment, which has in the past had nationalist far-right affiliations, was a militia formed to fight the Russians after the invasion of Ukraine in 2014 but has become a unit of the Ukrainian national guard. Yulia, an assistant to a Ukrainian politician, said the mother of one Azov soldier had received an image of her dead son from the Russians. “We don’t want our soldiers to become war prisoners, because there is a lot of propaganda around Azov,” she says. “Azov is a red rag for Russians, they hate them. If you are from Azov, there is no chance you will come back healthy or alive … We think our government can take more political and diplomatic steps. They can talk about it more.” Anna Naumenko, 25, a projects manager, received some voice messages from her husband Dmytro Danilov, 29, at 1am on Saturday that she said were difficult to hear. “He told me it was very hot there,” she says. “There are no painkillers for people with torn limbs. There are very little antibiotics, and most of them are used for operations only. “He also told me about a three-year-old girl who lives at Azovstal. She lost her parents, and there are a lot of children like that in the bunkers. She is running around, and pinching the soldiers, saying ‘painkiller.’” The women say they believe the British government could rally an international effort. They are seeking to travel to the UK to campaign but are as yet unable to get the visas, as many Ukrainians have found, with the Home Office website warning of a six-week wait. “My partner is a bit pessimistic, because they were promised help and nothing is happening,” says Olha Andrianova, 31, the owner of a chain of kindergartens, of Serghii, 26, a sergeant in the Azov regiment. “I am trying to cheer him up and ask him not to lose hope.”",News/World news,Anguish for partners of Mariupol’s defenders as Russian assault goes on,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/07/anguish-for-partners-of-mariupols-defenders-as-russian-assault-goes-on
5/8/2022,"On Friday morning, as broadcasters, pollsters and political analysts tried to make sense of a mixed bag of early results from the previous day’s local elections, no one was quite clear who had performed the best. All the party leaders seemed happy enough and the political messages were blurred. Boris Johnson was said by people in Downing Street to be in a buoyant mood when he sat down at his desk at 8.15am, believing the heat was off him. He had told a meeting with his advisers the previous day that “we are going to get our arses kicked”. But while he could see his party had indeed taken a beating and was losing seats, it seemed that a Tory meltdown had been avoided, and that Labour was failing to win back support behind the red wall. Keir Starmer was also cheery, outwardly at least, as he arrived in Barnet on Friday, hailing his party’s conquest of the Conservatives in that London borough, and even more impressively in Westminster and Wandsworth, as “a turning point” for Labour. Starmer was, however, glossing over rather less good news outside the capital, as an early narrative was slowly developing that Labour had flopped. Meanwhile Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey was declaring the elections no less than “historic” for his party as it clocked up some decent gains across the country. Twenty-four hours later, however, after the full national picture emerged, and results from Scotland and Northern Ireland – both of which have raised profound constitutional questions about the future of the UK – there was an altogether different sense about Thursday’s elections. The Tories had in fact done far worse than it had seemed earlier, particularly in the south of England, and had shed more than 400 seats, while Labour had performed much better and had gained more than 250. “Shocking,” said one minister, adding that Johnson would not recognise that he had caused the problem. “[The PM] won’t care though. We’ll have to lose a general election first.” This weekend, some Conservative MPs in traditional Tory areas in the south are so angry and worried by the southern revolt among their grassroots supporters that they are again considering whether to oust him. On Monday, London Tory MPs will meet to discuss what to do. One said: “We had thought that our people would stay at home and not vote. That is what we were told. But they didn’t. They came out in anger to kill us.” Another said: “There is a feeling among our voters that we have forgotten London and them, that all we care about is the red wall.” Other Tory MPs were less sure, saying they feared a failed coup could leave them in a worse position. “He is so unpredictable – we want a clean kill and a clear alternative,” said one senior Tory and Johnson critic. “Johnson is the problem.” The central challenge for the PM of holding together his 2019 coalition of red wall voters and traditional Tories has been exposed in these elections as a potentially fatal problem. To add to Johnson’s woes – and part and parcel of them – is a revival of the Liberal Democrats, which gained pace on Thursday and is also unnerving his backbenchers. The Lib Dems took councils in Conservative areas, including Somerset county council and Woking borough council, as they continued to fight back in the south-west and other rural areas where they were strong before joining the coalition in 2010. Speaking to the Observer, Davey described the results as “a tidal wave” that had defied his best expectations and led him to re-examine and expand the party’s general election ambitions. “We’ve spoken about the blue wall, but we’ve expanded that into the west country and rural communities. It’s more serious than it was when we won the Chesham and Amersham byelection last year … our battleground with them is beginning to expand. “We are going for the Conservatives. We think they are absolutely ruining our country.” Data emerged later on Friday confirming the Lib Dem surge and suggesting that Starmer could indeed lead the next government. The BBC projection for the national vote share put Labour on 35%, the Tories on 30% and the Liberal Democrats on 19%. Labour also performed well in Scotland, pushing the Tories into third place and suggesting all is not lost for Starmer’s party north of the border. “That was a big mood-changer for us,” said a member of the shadow cabinet, “when we saw what was happening north of the border.” The number of councillors elected in Scotland rose for every party except the Scottish Conservatives, who dropped 63. After 15 years in power, the SNP increased its tally by 22, with Labour gaining 20, the Lib Dems 20 and the Greens 16. With Sinn Féin on course for a stunning win in elections to the Northern Ireland assembly, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon was not slow to point out that the elections – which also saw a strong performance for Plaid Cymru in Wales – had raised “big questions” about the very future of the UK “as a political entity”. “If [Sinn Féin] emerge as the largest party today in Northern Ireland, which looks very likely, that will be an extraordinary result, and something that seemed impossible not that long ago,” Sturgeon said. “There’s no doubt there are big fundamental questions being asked of the UK as a political entity right now. They’re being asked here in Scotland, they’re being asked in Northern Ireland, they’re being asked in Wales, and I think we’re going to see some fundamental changes to UK governance in the years to come. I am certain one of those changes is going to be Scottish independence.” The ultimate goal of Sinn Féin – whose leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle O’Neill, declared the election to be a “historic day” – is for Northern Ireland to leave the UK and become one country with the Republic of Ireland. The Northern Ireland Act 1998 – which followed the signing of the Good Friday peace agreement – states that the UK “shall not cease to be so without the consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland voting in a poll”. It also says that the Northern Ireland secretary of the day will agree to hold a poll if it appears “likely” that a majority of people want a united Ireland. While opinion polls suggest that is not likely in the short term, party leader Mary Lou McDonald said on Friday that planning for a unity referendum would come within a “five-year framework”. Some Conservatives blame Johnson and Brexit for putting strains on the UK. One senior figure suggested MPs should act before it was too late. “It is really bad, they are fucking the Union by keeping him.” This week, the PM will be hoping that the Queen’s speech will reassure both his own MPs and party members, as well as the country, that he is the right person to lead the nation. It will focus on measures to “grow the economy” and help people with cost-of-living pressures such as the price of energy, and will include bills to take what he sees as the “opportunities of Brexit”, including deregulation. But rather than strengthening his position as he believed at first, Thursday’s elections may well have destabilised Johnson further, by bringing into the open many of the huge problems – Brexit-related and not – that his government is responsible for. Labour’s progress on Thursday has been overshadowed by its own problems over lockdown gatherings, with Starmer now being investigated by Durham police for drinking a beer in an MP’s office last year. But Johnson’s premiership remains in great peril as civil servant Sue Gray prepares to publish her report on Partygate, and the Metropolitan police complete their investigation. Ominously for Johnson and the Tories, there are more electoral tests soon. The Lib Dems have already started campaigning in Tiverton and Honiton, where a byelection will be held next month after the resignation of Tory MP Neil Parish, who admitted looking at porn in parliament. The constituency includes the prosperous Devon town of Cullompton, normally safe Conservative territory. There, lifelong Conservative voter Tim Cox said he was considering voting for a different party for the first time. “It’s just the general behaviour of the Conservative party. It’s pretty shocking – it’s appalling,” he said, pausing on the high street. “Johnson lied. It’s the bare-faced lies he’s told. It’s all about personal character to me, whether you are believable or credible as a leader of the country. There are a few of them in the cabinet, including Johnson, who just aren’t.” There seems to be some desire for change in the constituency, which has been staunchly Conservative since its creation in 1997. Ryan Lacey-Mills, 34, who works in car sales, voted for Johnson in 2019 but now felt the PM was a spent force. He is also weighing up the offer from other parties. “[Johnson] has had his time. He did Brexit,” he said. “Whether it is his fault or not, something needs a shakeup. It’s time for a change.” Even those still planning to vote Conservative struggle to summon up much enthusiasm. Steven Morris, 69, believes Johnson will have to go eventually. He can’t forgive the parties that took place in No 10 when the country was in lockdown. “I’ve got asthma. I was actually locked up for two months when it all kicked off – and to think they were having parties really upsets me,” he says, cradling a wrapped portion of fish and chips. “I always thought the Conservatives had got standards, but Boris hasn’t got any.” As they eye Tiverton and Honiton, the Lib Dems have their blood up. Johnson may be able to soldier on after Thursday’s local elections but whether he could survive a byelection defeat in a safe seat in a few weeks time is another matter entirely.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson sighed in relief – then the message from UK local elections took hold,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/07/boris-johnson-sighed-in-relief-then-the-message-from-uk-local-elections-took-hold
5/8/2022,"Manchester United have been accused of being on the beach with their dismal season drifting away for weeks and Ralf Rangnick’s hapless team were all at sea as Brighton condemned them to a humiliating defeat on the south coast. Graham Potter’s side raced out of the blocks and Moisés Caicedo’s early strike put them in command. Second-half goals from Marc Cucurella, Pascal Gross and the exceptional Leandro Trossard in the space of 11 minutes dished out a new low for United’s team of misfits as they slumped to a fifth successive away defeat. Brighton had not won at home since Boxing Day but it felt like Christmas arrived early for the home fans after this euphoric victory. Potter made one enforced change to the team which won easily at Wolves with Gross promoted in place of Enock Mwepu after the midfielder was ruled out with a groin injury. Rangnick, meanwhile, opted to stick with the same side which defeated Brentford in their final home game of the season last Monday. Harry Maguire was fit to return after missing the last three games with a back injury but started on the bench. The hosts made a bright start but Danny Welbeck was unable to guide his header from Trossard’s cross on target. Trossard looked in the mood to trouble United and was carrying a threat for Brighton down the right wing. United had lost their previous four away matches and there was a tentativeness to their early play which underlined their recent struggles. Their sluggish start was encapsulated by Cristiano Ronaldo wastefully sending a short-range pass out of play to the delight of the home fans. Brighton were sharper to the ball and their positivity was rewarded with the breakthrough after 15 minutes. Gross’s shot was charged down and the ball fell to Caicedo. The midfielder fired a low strike from the edge of the area beyond the despairing dive of David de Gea to score his first goal for the club. It was no more than Brighton deserved. In response, Bruno Fernandes attempted an ambitious volley from the edge of the area but miscued and it careered harmlessly out of play. Nemanja Matic was next in on the act but his tame effort was also well off target. United were struggling to deal with Trossard and the attacker’s direct run forced another corner with the ball deflected to safety. Welbeck then blasted a volley over the crossbar from a free-kick as Brighton continued to dominate. The hosts threatened again after Scott McTominay carelessly conceded possession in his own half but Trossard dragged his shot wide of the far post. Ronaldo had the chance to finally test Robert Sánchez before the break from a free-kick in a dangerous position, but blasted his strike over the bar. Brighton came close to adding a second goal just before half time after Raphaël Varane miscontrolled Sánchez’s long clearance down the pitch, but Welbeck was unable to direct his volley on target. It would have topped off a dominant first-half performance from the hosts against their fragile opponents. Rangnick was clearly unimpressed with the first 45 minutes and opted to introduce Fred and Edinson Cavani in place of Anthony Elanga and Matic in a double change at half-time. But within three minutes of the restart United fell further behind. Trossard teed up Cucurella and the Spain left-back blasted into the roof of the net from close range. The stadium was rocking and United were on extremely shaky ground. It took 55 minutes for United’s first shot on target but Juan Mata’s volley floated straight into the arms of Sanchez. Brighton compounded their opponents’ misery with a third goal after Trossard played in Gross and the midfielder calmly sidefooted past De Gea. It got even worse for the visitors when Diogo Dalot’s clearance was chested into the net by Trossard for Brighton’s fourth goal. It was checked by VAR for a possible handball but there was no respite for United. Alexis Mac Allister was then denied a fifth Brighton goal with his shot deflected on to the post by Dalot. United’s despair was summed up when Cavani tapped home after Roberto Sánchez parried the substitute Maguire’s header, only to be ruled offside. Erik ten Hag is focused on winning the title at Ajax before he contemplates his new job at Old Trafford, but when the incoming manager watches a rerun of this shambolic showing he could be forgiven for questioning his decision to take up the challenge. A monumental rebuilding job lies ahead and Brighton ruthlessly exposed all the failings in this broken team.",Sport/Football,Caicedo and Trossard to the fore as Brighton rock Manchester United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/07/brighton-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report
5/8/2022,"The first three letters of the winning team’s name were never in doubt and, from an early stage, neither were the other five. Leicester are supposed to be the toughest beasts the English Premiership has to offer but here they were made to look relatively toothless, a distant second in most areas to opponents who appear short odds to conquer Europe for a fifth time later this month. On this evidence it is going to take something extra special to deny the Irish province, particularly with their semi-final against Toulouse to be staged at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin. Wherever they play, though, they currently seem to have all the necessary answers, particularly against English opposition. Leinster have now won their last eight away games in England in this competition and appear to be still improving. Having trotted back down the tunnel at half-time already trailing by 20 points, there was never any realistic danger of Tigers burning bright on a clear, sunny east midlands evening. The ground was not full but the noise was spectacular throughout, to the point where it felt like a Test match in all but name. Leinster certainly play like an international side and would give England a run for their money home or away. It was a question, then, of whether the Tigers could make the leap from the top of the Premiership to another level. Their pre-match game plan was simple enough: to get under Irish skins physically and to rattle the favourites’ composure. Leinster, though, were ahead inside three minutes via a Johnny Sexton penalty for offside and much of the first quarter was a rhapsody in midnight blue. Sure, Leicester have power but their opponents outdid them thanks to their collective pace and their speed of thinking. Everyone knew the Tigers would kick a lot but Leinster’s response was to strike so quickly from deep that the hosts, at times, could barely lay a glove on them. The man of the match, Jamison Gibson-Park, James Lowe and Hugo Keenan, all excellent, kept the tempo daringly high and no side in the tournament can match the visitors’ strike rate in the opposing 22. The result was two Leinster tries inside seven game-shaping minutes. First the equally impressive Josh van der Flier surged through Harry Potter’s tackle to stretch and score before his Irish international teammate Robbie Henshaw, also involved earlier in the move, took a similarly direct route to the line from five metres out. A brace of Sexton conversions made it 17-0 and left the hosts to play a serious game of catch-up. It was not so much that Leicester were moderate, more that Leinster were looking every inch a collection of champions. Their knock-out defeats in the past two seasons to Saracens and La Rochelle have clearly stung but there was more to this classy demolition than a desire to settle a few old scores. Simply looked what they are: a well-coached, talented, dynamic side who believe rugby is a 15-man game and not just a grindathon. Leicester are used to defending against sides who recycle methodically and give them half a chance. Leinster’s ruck speed was at least a second quicker than is commonplace in the Premiership and they were also sharper in every other respect. If Van der Flier is not the player of this UK and Ireland season it is only because Gibson-Park has pipped him on the line; both are testament to the ability of the Leinster management to improve the players under their tutelage. Another Sexton penalty further extended his side’s half-time advantage, leaving Leicester requiring an oval-shaped miracle. To their credit they mounted a comeback of sorts, George Ford putting Chris Ashton over in the left corner before slotting the conversion, but Leinster can defend as well. Ross Byrne, on for Sexton, slotted an easy 66th minute penalty to push his side more than two scores clear and, despite a late Nic Dolly consolation try, there was to be no Manchester City-style stumble. As well as putting Leicester’s lofty domestic status into sharp perspective it was also another feather in the cap of Leinster’s senior coach Stuart Lancaster who has had a prominent part in the Irish side’s continuing rise. A penny for the thoughts of the watching England head coach Eddie Jones, still searching for players who can make a difference to the national team’s fortunes. Like everyone else connected with English rugby he will have headed home deep in thought. The Irish are currently well ahead and showing no sign of slackening their pace.",Sport/Sport,Leinster blow Leicester away in Champions Cup masterclass,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/07/leicester-leinster-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report
