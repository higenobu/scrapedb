The magnolia is alive with bloom and we count ourselves lucky. We have a steady supply of Lemsip and Strepsils and the roof terrace is shooting. The roses are covered in new crimson leaf. There are fat, dozy bumblebees bumbling about, obsessing over the stellata. And we have time to attack the new greenfly. Our isolation is made bearable by spring shoots. Tulips burst through. Narcissi grow. I wander round the terrace wrapped in scarves. Opposite, the churchyard trees start to come alive. The horse chestnut has budded. The finer trees take on another, near-invisible sheen. There is a yellowy-green watercolour wash at the tips. Soon enough the smaller street trees will be in blossom. I order in flower deliveries. A van comes with food and drink and daffs. We bring the outside in. Out the back window, the neighbours have begun busying in their gardens. The nearest is feeding and watering her trees and bushes. Others are trimming their jasmine, cutting back on overgrown fence. Tidying up wintry trellis for summer. I watch my daughter Kala as she potters around, pruning. She is already anxious about over-wintering spiders in her shed. Tools will be taken out shortly. Grass will soon need cutting. Later, she calls to say she has left some jars of Clematis armandii on our doorstep. I love their scent. One jar is sitting here on the kitchen table as I write. The other is in Henri’s ‘office’. Soon enough we will be out of isolation. We’ll be back at the garden centre, looking for interesting annuals, replacing woody herbs. Readying for the growing season. Happy BST.

3/27/2022,"One of the maritime agencies recruiting workers for P&O Ferries is advertising for crew members, saying no previous experience at sea required. Union officials warn that P&O Ferries could be jeopardising safety after dismissing 800 crew members and replacing them with workers paid less than the minimum wage. One of the firm’s vessels has been detained at Larne in Northern Ireland for being “unfit to sail” because of concerns over training. One of the companies recruiting for P&O Ferries, CSM Baltics – part of Columbia Shipmanagement, one of the world’s largest ship managers – has posted an ad on Facebook saying: “We are looking for a large number of stewards to work 12 hours day on board our ships and to have rest of 12 hours in hotels in France. No seafarers’ documents are needed, just previous experience in hospitality institutions.” The ad goes on to say the stewards will work a pattern of eight weeks on and eight weeks off. P&O Ferries says the agency also recruits for other shipping firms, and that it is not unusual to hire some crew members without previous maritime experience. The firm said all crew members would receive full training before setting sail. A P&O Ferries spokesperson said: “The safety of our passengers and crew is our foremost priority. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency is currently making port state inspections, which includes checking all crew certification.” The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) detained the P&O ferry European Causeway in Larne on Friday because of “failures on crew familiarisation, vessel documentation and crew training”. P&O Ferries sacked 800 staff without notice on 17 March and has admitted to breaching employment law by failing to consult with trades unions. Peter Hebblethwaite, chief executive of P&O Ferries, told MPs last week that the average rate of pay for new crew members would be £5.50 an hour. P&O says the pay rates are in line with international maritime standards. Hebblethwaite admitted to MPs that he had not personally seen the risk assessment on replacing experienced crews with agency workers before the redundancies. Darren Procter, national secretary of the RMT union, said he was “appalled” at P&O Ferries replacing entire crews. He said the agency ad for cross-Channel crew without experience raised serious concerns. He said: “They are cutting corners. It’s not just about training, but having crews who have worked together and are experienced.” Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has said it is unacceptable that ferry operators with regular UK routes could pay less than the minimum wage. A new package of measures would be brought before parliament to close a loophole which allows this. There were protests in Liverpool, Dover and Hull on Saturday against the P&O Ferries sackings. Labour has written to the government asking whether it will seek the removal of Hebblethwaite as a director under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986. P&O Ferries services between Dover and Calais and between Larne and Cairnryan in Scotland remain suspended. Services between Hull and Rotterdam are reduced, but ferries between Dublin and Liverpool are back in operation. A P&O Ferries spokesperson said any suggestion that safety was in any way compromised was “categorically false”. A spokesperson said all its crew members were trained under the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers.",News/Business,"No sea experience needed, says P&O agency ad for crews",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/27/no-sea-experience-needed-says-po-agency-ad-for-crews
3/27/2022,"Queens Wine Bar and Bistro, 8-10 Queen Avenue, Liverpool L2 4TX (0151 345 6646). Starters £6.50-£9, mains £14-£27, desserts £7, wines from £18 On the morning my train to Liverpool pulled out of London Euston, the media was full of images of other trains: crowded ones, filled with terrified people, fleeing for their lives, an invading Russian army at their backs. I, meanwhile, was going to lunch. That morning Philippa Perry, this newspaper’s agony aunt, was also on a train. With time on her hands, she invited her Twitter followers to ask her anything. Among the many questions was one about how we should deal with the terrible news from Ukraine, especially if we are prone to anxiety. Philippa replied with her familiar brand of wisdom. We should, she said, “Stay in the present and not the hypothetical mythical future. Deal with what is, not what might be. Remember to enjoy yourself as much as possible. It doesn’t help anyone if you don’t enjoy yourself.” It made an awful lot of sense to me. And now I’ll add a thought or two of my own. These thoughts will look like the terrible self-justifications of a man who, in a time of war, is merely reporting from the frontline of lunch. Self-justifications they may be. That doesn’t necessarily make them wrong. People fleeing war want to be safe. They want to be free of the terror of injury or death, free of the fear of the destruction of their families and their homes and their country. But beyond that what they want, what we all want, is normality: to be able go to work, to look after ourselves and our families, to live free of repression and to be able to enjoy ourselves by going to the movies, or yes, out to lunch. We shouldn’t be casual about the importance of normality or dismiss it as irrelevant in a time of dreadful emergency. We should treasure it. Because there’s something else. We are all of us smart enough to hold more than one thought in our heads at a time. We can deplore the appalling barbarity of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while also wondering where to go for a nice meal out. I’m not big on grandstanding statements about the meaning of life, but I do propose that having a nice time should be a part of it. So let me introduce you to Queens Wine Bar and Bistro in Liverpool which, in dark days, can show you a very nice time indeed. It’s one of those quiet, unassuming places which, without fuss or bother, gets things right in a comforting rather than a self-congratulatory way; where the starters are priced in single digits and the mains are mostly in the mid-teens; where the wine list is engineered to enable you to drink rather than show off. It’s located down Queen Avenue, a narrow shopping arcade of handsome Grade II listed buildings which even the Liverpool Echo once described as one of the city’s “best-kept secrets”. Queens opened in the summer of 2019. In pandemic years, that means it’s barely been feeding people for 12 months, though it feels older: heavily varnished floorboards, dark green walls, wood tables and fatly cushioned banquettes in the bay windows. Next to us is a gentleman of a certain age in a chalk-striped suit, eating alone. He asks for a glass of the “best claret you have”, as if channelling Withnail. The waiter gives him the quiet reassurance reserved for regulars. It’s the kind of place where being a regular would seem like a fine idea. The food is true to the word “bistro”. It involves encouraging ingredients with the occasional flourish, but with nothing to make the eyes widen with too much curiosity, or to distract you from the conversation you’re having over that glass of crisp vinho verde, a blackboard special at £7 a glass. There are cheese croquettes made with Blacksticks Blue, or salt-baked beetroot with hazelnuts and a blood-orange salad. Smoked mackerel toasts are dainty slices of toasted baguette. The fish has been bound in a horseradish cream, then topped in turn by ribbons of pickled onion and dribbles of good peppery olive oil. There are cornichons on the side. Today’s special is a brown crab rarebit so yes, something else on toast, but I’m not complaining: there’s lots of white crab meat packed in there beneath a glazed topping, heavy with the insistent seafood funk of the brown. With it is a vivid salad of radicchio, shaved fennel and capers. It’s a beauty. A large serving of glossy mussels for £15 comes with a mess of cooked-down leeks, in a confidently spiced Café de Paris sauce which is just the right shade of creamy beige. They bring one bowl for the shells and another in which you can clean your fingers. If you don’t need to use the finger bowl, you aren’t doing the mussels properly. A third bowl is full of the frite part of moules frites. They are far too thick-cut to justify the title. Any self-respecting Belgian would disapprove. But we are in Liverpool, not Antwerp. These are site-specific chunky chips. More importantly, they clearly came from this kitchen rather than the ubiquitous freezer bag. They rustle against each other, and have many golden crevices. My companion and I fight each other for them, then mop them in the Café de Paris sauce. The quenelle of celeriac “choucroute” with a pork ribeye, served pink, is closer to a rough purée but I’m not going to get hung up on nomenclature. It lubricates the meat very nicely, alongside a dollop of apple sauce. A side dish of hispi cabbage, the go-to brassica of modern times, is the good kid who’s started hanging out with the wild crowd. What was once a bowl of green veg is now embraced by a fabulously sticky, russet and mahogany mess of crisp lardons and pearl onions in a hugely savoury reduced sherry sauce. Desserts are designed to sustain you through a cold, rainy day in Liverpool: Basque cheesecake, buttermilk rice pudding with honey and nutmeg, crème caramel. We locate space for a slice of a well-made malt and dark chocolate tart, with a filling the colour of a night sky, beautifully thin pastry and a good scoop of chantilly cream on the side. Let’s be clear. None of this will make the world a better place. None of it will make the bad things stop. But enjoying it really won’t make things worse, and it may make you feel a little better. That’s all we can ask of lunch. It’s a big hello to Trampoline, a new café in London’s Islington offering employment opportunities and training to refugees. Trampoline has been founded by the people behind Nemi Teas, and is a partnership with Groundwork, a group of London charities focused on poverty action and the environment, and Hotel School, which provides training in hospitality to the homeless and vulnerable as a way of helping them into employment. Trampoline has also pledged to work with other food-based social enterprises including Redemption Roasters, the world’s first prison-based coffee business. At trampolinecafe.com. Mission Mars, the company behind the Bavarian-themed bar and restaurant Albert’s Schloss in Manchester, is to open an outpost on Bold Street in Liverpool this autumn.

3/27/2022,"Viña Leyda Single Vineyard Garuma Sauvignon Blanc, Leyda, Chile 2020, £12, Tesco I have a feeling that not all that many people regard Chilean wine as the sort of thing you’d buy as a treat or for a special occasion. The country has, for as long as I can remember, been very good at providing the sort of Good Cheap Wines I was writing about in this space last week. But on those occasions when you want to break what is still for most UK wine-drinkers the psychologically powerful £10 barrier, the (sometimes spurious) reassurance of a more famously ‘fine’ wine producing region – France, Italy, but also California and Australia – tends to be the default option. Increasingly, however, I’m coming across Chilean wines that have that hard-to-define little extra that makes a wine worth shelling out a few quid more for: that bit of extra verve, complexity, character, or concentration to make them stand out from their cheaper peers. Viña Leyda’s bracing, bristling, lime and pea-pod-scented, seafood-friendly sauvignon is certainly one such wine. Errazuriz Aconcagua Costa Pinot Noir, Aconcagua Valley, Chile 2020, from£16, oxfordwine.co.uk; stonevine.co.uk; cellarselected.com Viña Leyda was one of the earliest producers to emerge from one of the most important developments in Chilean wine in the past 20 years: the rush to plant vineyards along the country’s long Pacific coastline. These vineyards have worked wonders on the quality of Chilean wines made from grape varieties that prefer cooler conditions than those that can be found in much of the traditional Chilean grape-growing regions, inland along the Central Valley south of Santiago. The cooling Pacific breezes help preserve the necessary acidity that gives the best sauvignon blancs, but also chardonnays and rieslings, their balancing lift and zip. Another of these new coastal vineyard areas can be found a couple of hours to the north of Leyda, in Aconcagua Costa, where one of Chilean wines biggest names, Errazuriz, has established a vineyard that makes some of Chile’s (and South America’s) finest, chiselled chardonnay and beautifully expressive, supple pinot noir. Koyle Cerro Basalto Mediterraneo, Alto Colchagua, Chile 2019, £19, thewine society.com The majority of Chile’s winegrowing territory has a decidedly Mediterranean feel. But its signature grape varieties have tended to have Atlantic or northerly origins: certainly for red wines, Chile has long been identified with Bordeaux’s cabernet sauvignon, carmenère and merlot. There are delightful, and variously styled, Chilean wines made from each of those varieties, but some of the most interesting wines I’ve tasted recently have had a decidedly southern European accent. Top of the list is a blend inspired by the spicy, solar-powered, gutsy wines of France’s southern Rhône Valley and Languedoc-Roussillon, featuring mourvèdre (going by its southeastern Spanish name monastrell), grenache, carignan and syrah. It’s a wine of robust power and richness, with a seriously savoury and spicy dimension that hasn’t always been a hallmark of Chilean wine. It also has a balancing fragrant freshness that its makers attribute to another of Chilean wines recent positive moves: the development of vineyards in the relative cool on higher land in the hills.

3/27/2022,"A chef and humanitarian who has been serving millions of meals to Ukrainians has accused the UN and the EU of a lack of leadership in response to the refugee crisis, warning of a “huge humanitarian emergency at the doorstep of Europe”. Speaking from Lviv in Ukraine, José Andrés, a two-Michelin-starred Spanish-American chef who runs not-for-profit World Central Kitchen (WCK) claimed the UN and the EU do not have enough “boots on the ground” to care for the refugees. WCK has served more than 3m meals in the region since the start of Russia’s invasion. “We need to be expecting more from the big organisations. If not, my question is what do we have them for? What do we spend the millions for?” he said. “We are lacking that leadership.” While he praised the work of the Polish government, he said looking after the refugees’ basic needs is a “gigantic undertaking” that needs more support. The crisis has displaced more than 10 million people, according to UN figures. At least 3.7 million people have left Ukraine – 2.2 million of whom are in Poland – and an estimated 6.5 million are displaced within the country. WCK, which responds to natural disasters and humanitarian crises around the world, arrived at the Medyka border crossing in Poland within hours of the invasion and almost immediately started feeding refugees fleeing Ukraine. Its network of more than 200 staff and volunteers is now supplying about 180,000 meals a day across Ukraine, Poland, Hungary, Moldova and Romania. Andrés’s comments came as Nato and G7 leaders gathered in Brussels on Thursday for emergency meetings about the Ukraine crisis. Instead of making speeches and watching the situation worsen from a distance, Andrés said, leaders should be implementing systems to help refugees find safety and to better protect women and children from going missing. The restaurant community across Ukraine has united to help provide food – even under heavy Russian bombardment, occupation and siege. WCK is working with more than 150 restaurants and chefs in Ukraine who are providing meals. In Mariupol, Andrés said, chefs have managed to hunt for deer and make stews, despite being under siege, and many are cooking in bunkers. “Chefs they are heroes. They are cooking in bunkers, they’re cooking under shelling, and they’re gathering food any way they can,” he added. “It’s this kind of moment where everybody does what they can with whatever they have at hand.” Karla Hoyos, the chef leading WCK’s kitchen near the border in Prezmyśl, Poland, flew there on a one-way ticket from Miami four days after the start of the invasion, researching Ukrainian comfort food on the plane. In six days they built the kitchen from scratch in an empty warehouse, where they now produce between 10,000 and 12,000 meals a day including borscht, chicken stew and cups of hot chocolate and broth. “We’re sending a message when we give food. We’re sending a message of dignity, of hope – that you’re not alone and we’re here for you. We want to make sure they have a dignified meal that is made with thought, with love,” she said, “this is comfort for you and we’re going to make sure we do our best to give them that.” While they were building the kitchen, Hoyos’s team went to the border to distribute hot drinks, and she was overwhelmed at the number of children and mothers. “I remember this lady, she was carrying a lot of luggage, she was pushing a wheelchair with her mother in,” she said. “In 2022, why are people going through this? It’s hard to accept this is going on.” In Lviv, at WCK’s Ukraine headquarters, they are stocking up on supplies which they can then distribute around the country, and working with people from across Ukraine to work out how best to support chefs who are cooking for their communities. Tim Kilcoyne, WCK director of relief and special operations, said: “There are so many restaurants and small brasseries that are continuing to cook, and many restaurants with basement kitchens that are cooking and doing what they can to support shelters, orphanages and hospitals.” The UNHCR said mobilising within Ukraine has “proved challenging, as many of our colleagues have themselves been displaced by the war and are working under enormous security constraints”. A UNHCR spokesperson said: “Governments, with the support of local partners, are leading the emergency response inside Ukraine and in neighbouring countries. Our objective is to support and complement these efforts wherever gaps are identified and where our assistance can have the biggest impact.” He added: “We are extremely grateful for the incredible support NGOs and local actors, including WCK (with whom we are collaborating), have offered to refugees fleeing Ukraine.”Citing the EU civil protection mechanism providing aid and a €500m (£415m) emergency support package, a European Commission spokesperson said it had “mobilised the EU’s largest-ever aid response for Ukraine and is working on all fronts to support the country and its people with emergency assistance, including neighbouring countries receiving people fleeing the invasion”. But, they said, humanitarian access has made it difficult for aid to get to some areas.",News/World news,‘What are the UN and EU for if not to care for refugees?’ asks food NGO in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/27/what-are-the-un-and-eu-for-if-not-to-care-for-refugees-asks-food-ngo-in-ukraine
3/27/2022,"On particularly warm and damp winter nights, as thousands of Pacific newts venture out onto the verdant Petaluma hills north of San Francisco – so does the Chileno Valley Newt Brigade. As the sunlight fades, volunteers spread out over a mile-long stretch of a rural road. Wearing reflective vests, much like school crossing guards, these brigadiers are here to help the newts make a perilous journey from a lake on one side of the road to the hills on the other. Working in pairs, they scan the road with flashlights, gently picking up each wriggly newt they find and moving them to safety. It is, in many ways, a Sisyphean endeavor. Thousands of these amphibians perish each year on busy San Francisco Bay area roadways. Of the few remaining populations of Pacific newts, those in the Bay Area face among the highest known roadkill rates anywhere in the world. If it weren’t for the brigade’s efforts, thousands more might die as they migrate to and from water sources for breeding season. This winter, the brigade saved about 4,400 newts, and found 980 flattened. And cars are only one of many perils the newts encounter. Extreme, prolonged drought and heatwaves have already begun to affect California newts in the southern part of the state – and threaten to affect populations in this northern region too. But against the incomprehensible immensity of the climate crisis and unchecked development, many of the brigade volunteers said it was the audacious smallness of the effort that appealed to them. Helping a few small newts cross a one-mile stretch of country road offers a way, they said, to keep hope. “It’s about just getting out and just doing something,” said Sally Gale, who founded the brigade three years ago. “You don’t have to justify each effort by saying it will change the world. You just have to start somewhere.” On a temperate March evening, half a dozen brigadiers are out on Chileno Valley Road, adjacent to Laguna Lake where the newts breed each winter. “Oh! Oh!” Linda Sheppard spots one, right on the lane divider. “Oh, you’re a little guy aren’t you?” She photographs him for the brigade’s records, and then gingerly picks him up and carries him across, while her partner keeps an eye out for oncoming cars. “OK, be well!” Some nights, when misty rains coax hundreds of newts out all at once, the volunteers carry buckets to ferry them. On slower days, excited yelps pierce through the sounds of frogs and passing traffic each time someone spots one of the ruddy-brown amphibians. Christine Davidian zips up and down the road on her bike, holding her flashlight between her teeth. Meanwhile, Richard James – who’s built a reputation around these parts for being one of the most fastidious brigadiers – is having a slower night: “Seems like Christine’s getting them all!” Two species of Pacific newts – California and rough-skinned – live in this area. They’re difficult to tell apart, but most brigadiers are practiced at doing so. Volunteers work quickly to photograph and geotag each newt – whether dead or alive – that they spot on the road, uploading the information to the citizen science website iNaturalist. They scrape the dead newts off the road using steel spatulas and toss them to the side. “It’s sad, just so sad,” says Kristen Franklin, a fourth-grade teacher who joined the brigade two years ago. But usually, there’s hardly any time to dwell – there are so many live ones to meet, and save. The newts crawl slowly, timidly. “They have these cute little hands that they stretch out – like baby hands almost,” says Gale. “And they have these fat little bellies. And when they walk, they wiggle their little bottoms.” They tend to freeze when approached – and sometimes, they flick their necks and tails up to make a u-shaped defensive pose, exposing their sunset orange undersides to signal that they’re poisonous to eat. The volunteers coat their hands in water to add a buffer between their own rough, oily skin and the newt’s soft, delicate bellies. The newts are so discrete, so temperamentally unobtrusive, that they slip out of many Californians’ consciousness. Until recently, Gale hadn’t given them much thought either, despite having moved into her Victorian ranch house off Chileno Valley Road 30 years ago and having been involved in local ecosystem restoration efforts for decades. Then one winter night in 2018, Gale and her husband Mike were driving back from a dinner party, when an odd compulsion came over her: she needed to get out of the car. “It was warm. There had been a good rain. And the air just felt rich,” she recalls. And she saw the soft-bodied creatures sprawled across the road. As Mike drove slowly behind her, she picked them up, one by one, and moved them to safety. By the time she got home that night, “I decided I had to do something”. Cars are only one of several big, existential threats that the palm-length Pacific newts are now facing. Across California, drought and habitat loss are straining already vulnerable populations. During last year’s historically dry summer, local ranchers drained the drought-diminished Laguna Lake and planted it with cattle feed. Most larvae and juvenile newts living in it likely died, though some may have survived in the nearby marsh, Gale says. The lake refilled with the winter rains. But with more dry years ahead, she worries that the newt population will be decimated. As a cattle rancher herself, she says she understands firsthand the pressures farmers feel. But the newts have been here for thousands of years she says – they have a right to survive as well. In time, Gale hopes that data collected by her newt brigade will help strengthen the case for protecting California and rough-skinned newts. Vehicles are one of the biggest threats to wildlife in California, but even as efforts to save iconic mountain lions, kit foxes and desert tortoises from road accidents gain steam, diminutive newts haven’t captured the same level of funding and commitment. Right now, researchers lack a sense of how many newts live in California and how their populations have changed over the decades. Around a hundred miles to the south of Chileno Valley Road, another group of volunteers – the Alma Bridge Newt Patrol – have been painstakingly documenting more than 5,000 newts a year that perish while crossing a four-mile stretch of road in the Santa Cruz mountains. Unlike Gale’s brigade, the newt patrol aren’t able to save many newts – it’s illegal for them to station along the winding mountain road at night. Instead, about a dozen volunteers, led by biologist Merav Vonshak, document the dead. “It’s really heartbreaking,” says Vonshak – especially in late fall, when many juvenile newts die. “As a scientist, I try to detach myself and focus on how important it is to document this.” Using the volunteers’ data, researchers at the University of California, Davis Road Ecology Center discovered that the newts crossing Alma Bridge Road were experiencing one of highest roadkill rates reported for any wildlife species in the world. A study commissioned by local officials found that the adult California newt population along the Alma Bridge Road will disappear completely in about 50 years if nothing is done. If anything, the report presented an optimistic view, Vonshak says. It didn’t consider how the climate crisis, and development would affect the population. Researchers have found that southern California newts’ body condition – a measure comparing weight and length – declined by 20% between 2008 and 2016. It’s a sign that temperature extremes and drought – exacerbated by global heating – are already affecting Pacific newts, according to Gary Bucciarelli, a conservation biologist at UCLA who led the 2020 study. Newts in northern California are likely to suffer the same consequences in coming years, he says. The newts are “dealing with more prolonged droughts and changing precipitation patterns due to climate change, they’re dealing with wildfires”, Bucciarelli said. “They’re getting hammered hard.” Gale knows that she and her brigade can only keep up their work for so long. “Of course, it’s not a sustainable solution,” she says. Both newt groups have been petitioning for longer-term solutions – advocating for either closing the roads during migration season, or elevating the road so that at least some proportion of the newts to cross safely underneath. But so far, their efforts have gained little traction. Past grant applications to elevate stretches of Alma Bridge Road and create newt crossings were rejected. And the newts, which aren’t listed as endangered or threatened, are less likely to be prioritized for existing state or federal funding for such projects. Conservationists are lobbying for a new bill, introduced in the California assembly last month, that would require the state transportation agency to implement 10 projects to improve wildlife connectivity per year. If it’s signed into law, that bill could help fund underpasses for newt populations on state roads and major highways. But since both Alma Bridge Road and Chileno Valley Road are county-managed roads, neither would be helped directly. “It’s tough, because how long can we save the newts while we’re also building more highways?” says Paul Licht, the former director of the botanical gardens at the University of California, Berkeley – who has advised efforts to protect migrating newts. “I mean – not long.” “But what’s your alternative? To do nothing?” he added. That’s Gale’s view as well. And there’s something about being outside on dark, damp nights and holding up the squirming newts, she says, that can help override all the uncertainty and worry. “​​It’s kind of like when you hold a human baby,” says brigadier Shannon Drew. “It’s this precious, little, perfect thing you’re holding – and you want to fight for it.”",News/US news,How does a newt cross the road?

3/27/2022,"Ireland could see big victories at the Academy Awards this year, with Irish actors nominated in key categories including best supporting actor and actress. Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast, inspired by his own childhood during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, secured seven nominations, including for best picture and best original screenplay. At Ireland’s own Oscar party, the Oscar Wilde awards, in Los Angeles on Thursday, the mood was optimistic, with Belfast cast members and other celebrities excited about the film’s nominations and the power of seeing broad recognition for an Irish story. With his critically lauded role as a Northern Irish father in Branagh’s film, actor Jamie Dornan is throwing off the shackles of the Fifty Shades of Grey franchise, in which he played an insipid sex maniac who seduces a woman who wears cardigans. Dornan literally threw off those shackles as he accepted an Oscar Wilde award for his work on Thursday, producing a pair of handcuffs from inside his jacket and then casting them aside. In a tearful speech, Dornan honored his father, a renowned Belfast doctor who died of Covid-19 a year ago, and thanked Branagh for taking a chance on him by casting him. Dornan, himself a Belfast native, said in his speech that he proudly identifies as Irish. “Where I come from identity is very skewed. If you’re from the North, how you identify yourself gets you gets you into a whole heap of trouble, maybe thirty years of trouble, and it’s constantly going to be a source of conflict, sadly.” “I’ve always been told that I’m Irish, it’s all I’ve ever known. I’ve been proud of that since the day I was born,” Dornan said, pledging to continue to try to tell Irish stories. “If you’re lucky enough to be Irish, then you are lucky enough.” Branagh himself, who also received an Oscar Wilde award, appeared only by video, amid reports that he had tested positive for Covid-19. He said he felt “fighting fit” but that he wanted to respect awards protocols. The Irish Oscars party, now in its 16th year, is hosted by the US-Ireland Alliance, founded by Trina Vargo, a former foreign policy adviser to Senator Edward Kennedy. The non-profit aims to introduce rising Irish talent to Hollywood, as well as to celebrate established Irish and Irish American stars. This year, the award for a new talent to watch went to actor Dónall Ó Héalai, a central figure in a new ascendancy of Irish-language films. Four years ago, Ó Héalai gave a popular Ted Talk about the beauty of the Irish language. After years of struggling to build an acting career, he starred in Arracht, a 2019 drama that was the first Gaelic film about the potato famine, and Foscadh, a contemporary Gaelic film about a neurodivergent man from Connemara trying to find love after his mother’s death. Both films were chosen as Ireland’s official selections for the foreign language Oscars. “I’m really happy that I’m able to act in my own language,” Ó Héalai told the Guardian in an interview on the party’s Green Carpet. He said the blockbuster success of other foreign language films and television, such as Parasite and Squid Game, had created new opportunities for foreign language films with streaming services like Netflix, but that he also believed the rise of Gaelic film was driven by a renewed interest among the Irish in looking inward at their own history. In filming Arracht, he said in his award speech, “t​he dignity of our ancestors was with us for that entire shoot”. There are more promising Irish-language films in the works: Ó Héalai said he was excited about Tarrac, a forthcoming Gaelic film about women’s traditional boat racing in West Kerry. But it’s likely that Ó Héalai will soon be playing some roles in English-language films, as well. Reinaldo Marcus Green, director of the best picture nominee King Richard, called Ó Héalai a close friend and said they met in New York when he was a struggling student film-maker with $300,000 of student loan debt, “looking at Uber applications”. Ó Héalai convinced him not to give up, telling him: “Just keep going. You’re so close,” Green said. Green hailed Ó Héalai’s “brilliant work” as he presented him with his award, saying that soon everyone “will know his name”. Dornan called Ó Héalai’s work on Irish language film “vital and necessary” and said he was “so excited” to see the next steps in his career. Glenn Keogh, a film and TV actor who has appeared in Curb Your Enthusiasm and Sons of Anarchy, said there had long been a “fantastic” and “close-knit” Irish network in Hollywood, and one that had been crucial to his own career. When he had arrived in Los Angeles 15 years ago, Keogh said, he had joined an Irish football team, the Santa Monica Celtics, which had helped him make entertainment industry connections. The Irish-Hollywood network was thriving today, he said, with established Irish professionals always happy to offer advice and help in securing day jobs to their newly arrived comrades. That wide Irish network was on display on Thursday, with Oscar Wilde guests ranging from Fig O’Reilly, an Irish American model and television presenter who was crowned Miss Universe Ireland in 2019, to Donie O’Sullivan, the beloved Irish CNN reporter who covers politics and disinformation, to the Star Wars director JJ Abrams, who has emceed the Oscar Wilde awards for years and was named an “honorary Irishman” at the event in 2010. Abrams said he was gearing up to film part of his new sci-fi series, Demimonde, in Ireland in the coming months, and credited Vargo, the event’s host, with helping him film parts of Star Wars in Ireland. In a speech, Abrams called the Oscar Wilde awards “so much of a better deal than the other Oscars” because they’re shorter, there are no losers, and almost everyone is Irish, meaning “100% of the winners are going to be gorgeous and want to party”. Terry George, who was nominated for best original screenplay for Belfast, has devoted much of his career to making films about the Troubles in Northern Ireland. “I’m excited for Belfast. It’s my hometown,” he said on the Green Carpet. George’s work is deeply personal: he was imprisoned in the mid-1970s after being accused of carrying weapons for the Irish Republican Army. Whether or not he wins an Oscar on Sunday, George told the Guardian he was already at work on a new script exploring these themes: “I’m trying to tell the story of the Good Friday peace agreement,” he said. “Just a little, small story.” ",Arts/Film,‘A better deal than the Oscars’: the party celebrating the Irish in Hollywood,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/27/oscar-wilde-awards-irish-ireland-hollywood
3/27/2022,"Considering the state of the world, revisiting the Falklands war might feel badly timed, but this documentary is to mark the 40th anniversary of the biggest amphibious operation the UK had undertaken since D-day. The comprehensive, gravely narrated film uses powerful footage to relive events and speaks to troops, commanders and the head of the SAS in the Falklands, Sir Michael Rose, for the first time about how close the force came to defeat.

Do the Milanese get enough respect for what they bring to the Italian table? Tucci wraps his chops round its delicacies to find out. HR It’s the penultimate episode of the final season, and Tommy is still going full throttle in spite of his diagnosis. After setting out to change the face of Birmingham’s Chinatown, he makes another questionable move that will change his family’s future – and still has time to squeeze in an extramarital encounter on a barge. HR The slinky spy remake continues with Harry and Jean setting off to the Pacific in pursuit of nuclear weapons being tested there, while the inscrutable Dalby hunts for an old love. Amid this drama’s double-crossing and stiff cocktails, the chemistry between lead stars Lucy Boynton and Joe Cole is great to watch. Henry Wong Justin Staple’s 2020 documentary makes its TV debut, exploring the phenomenon of subculture rappers on online music platform SoundCloud.

Simon Wardell Molly’s Game, 10pm, BBC Two The true story of a former skier who ran a high-stakes poker game for the great and the not-so-good gets the Aaron Sorkin treatment in this seductive, quick-witted film. Jessica Chastain impresses as the smart but underestimated Molly Bloom, who works her way into the exclusive circle of LA’s high-rollers by catering to their gambling demands, until hit by FBI charges. Sparks fly with Idris Elba’s defence attorney but it’s the power-dressing Chastain – driven but sympathetic – who is the tale’s principal focus, luring us into big-money poker’s inherently dramatic world. SW La La Land, 11.05pm, BBC One It didn’t win the best film Oscar in the end, but Damien Chazelle’s part homage, part rewriting of the classic Hollywood musical is a joyous experience. Aspiring actor Mia (Emma Stone) and aspiring jazz pianist Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) fall for each other in an LA of primary colours and perfect sunsets – with the film as much in love with the city as the couple. Dreams – attainable and not – temper their affair, with Stone and Gosling’s non-Broadway dancing and singing (music by Justin Hurwitz) giving a naturalistic twist to the gloriously stylised visuals.

3/27/2022,"The question I don’t know how to get over my ex. I feel as if the breakup has been like a frog being slowly boiled to death – I didn’t see it coming and it got progressively worse. In September, we had a holiday abroad together and he enquired about apartments and asked me to think about whether it was a place I could see myself moving to. We had also agreed that I would come off the pill in a couple of months. He came with me to two weddings and my family said how happy we seemed. Then he visited a friend in the US and came back whingeing that I wasn’t physical enough and we didn’t have enough sex. Since then he has run away from me. How am I supposed to get closure if he won’t speak to me? Also, money has been an issue. He is on a six-figure salary, and has judged me throughout our relationship because I have not sought a better-paid job. Sex has always been bad – and I was willing to fake orgasms for the rest of my life to be with him. It doesn’t make sense because he was never adventurous or willing to talk about experimenting or switching things up in the bedroom. I am drawing the conclusion that he has enjoyed wasting my time and suddenly had enough, but I can’t get over him. He is one of few long-term relationships I have had. He clearly doesn’t give a damn about me. I am mourning the loss of my lifelong need to have a family. I am 39, so my time for children is running out. How do I climb out of this abyss? Philippa’s answer It must be disappointing that your dream of having a family with this man has come crashing down. I’m sorry you are feeling broken-hearted, and angry. You wanted a long-term relationship and a family. You felt time was running out, but then he came along and you found someone to have it with. At that time, you were deaf to the alarm bells. You say he doesn’t give a damn about you. I’m sorry, this is going to sound harsh, but I’m not sure how much you care for him either. I think it may have been more about what this man represented for you – a lifeline to the possibility of realising your ambition of a family. It does sound as if you have been blind to the cracks already showing: sexual incompatibility; your lying to him about your sexual satisfaction; his attitude about your earnings; when he tried to talk to you about a problem you experienced it as “whingeing”. I can’t see much evidence that makes me think you were particularly well-suited. You seem satisfied that, to other people, you appeared to be a happy couple. It is as though, so long as things looked OK on the outside, he would do. Why was this enough for you? I don’t think it should have been. You are mourning the loss of a dream. You tried to fit this man into your dream, but I’m not sure you ever really knew him. It sounds as if it was the dream that you were in love with. You talk about this relationship as a waste of your time – that doesn’t sound like you ever really enjoyed it. I don’t blame you for assimilating the dream girls are sold that, one day, their prince will come and carry them off to a magical castle. In general, women are told that fulfilment lies in a husband and children, and that true happiness is not found in other quarters. I think many of us, especially women, have this idea, held unconsciously deep inside us, that this is what happiness is. But such an idea is only an introject. An introject is when we unconsciously adopt an attitude of a culture or of others and think that it is our own. Perhaps what feels so hard for you is letting go of the idea of him you had at the start of your relationship and that picture of your future. Moving forward, to climb out of your abyss you will have to unpack everything that’s ever been implied or told to you about what happiness should look like. Then only put back what is true for you. There will be some finding out for you to do about this. You can have the new experience of living in the moment and asking yourself how you feel about your experiences and let your feelings be more of a guide rather than what you think should make you happy. You can embark on the exciting journey of uncertainty and curiosity. You don’t need your old idea that unless your prince has arrived by your 39th birthday, it is too late for happiness – that is not a truth. I love your frog metaphor. You haven’t been boiled to death, you escaped while the water was getting warm. Now look around you at the other frogs and enjoy their company and enjoy yourself. Don’t think about how they can fit into a preconceived dream, but be more guided by how you feel in yourself when you are with them. And by frogs I don’t just mean potential princes, I mean absolutely anything and everything.

3/27/2022,"The small screen boasts some magnificent mums. They are loving, loyal and always there to listen. They lay on excellent dinners and even better cuddles. So, to mark Mother’s Day, we’ve taken time out from our chores and homework (they gave us permission, honest) to select our top 12 TV mums. Apologies to my own mum. If you’re reading this, Valerie, I only left you out because you’re not on telly (although you should be). Anyway, boil the kettle and put the best china out for our Mother’s Day dozen. And feel free to tell us your own below … Who wouldn’t want to be her “special little guy” like Bart? Marjorie Jacqueline Simpson (née Bouvier) is the blue-beehived, raspy-voiced glue holding the world’s most recognisable family together. Miraculously, she hasn’t aged a day in 35 years. She doesn’t hate you for failing, she loves you for trying. Oh, Homey. Owns a shaggy dog named Paul Anka! Runs an inn! Rarely stops eating! Behold, the mum we all secretly wish we had. After getting pregnant with her daughter, Rory, at 16, single mom ; (Lauren Graham) cannily moved to Stars Hollow, Connecticut, a cosy community ideal for raising a child alone. All sharp quips, film quotes and tough love, the us-against-the-world duo have a best mate bond that’s the envy of mothers-and-daughters everywhere. Pour a cup of coffee, talk a mile a minute and come here for a hug. Forget Connell’s silver chain. His single “mam” was the real cult star of the hit Sally Rooney adaptation. Played by Sarah Greene (not that one), she called him out over ghosting Marianne (Daisy Edgar-Jones) at school and supported the class-divided, tongue-tied lovers throughout their on/off romance. She’s firm, she’s fair, she’s got great hair and, as Edgar-Jones tweeted: “We all need a Lorraine in our lives.” Patriarchy, my arse. It’s Sue Johnston’s caring soul that’s the linchpin of the Mancunian couch potato clan. She waits hand-and-foot on her flatulent, misanthropic husband Jim, bone-idle daughter Denise, gawky son Antony and elderly mother Norma, aka “Nanna”. But “Barb” rarely minds because she’s all about family. Oh and fags. Fancy a brew? There’s almost nothing this plaid-wearing mum won’t do for her son. She communicates via Christmas fairy lights, she faces down evil scientists and Russian spies, and, in the name of Will, her missing child, she happily ventures into a hellscape parallel dimension to fight a Demogorgon. Also, crucially, she’s Winona, actual, Ryder. While the school-gates sitcom’s try-hard middle-class mums are in perma-panicked pursuit of perfection, neither shrugging single parent Liz (Diane Morgan) nor high-flying exec Meg (Tanya Moodie) seem to give a flying Sarah & Duck. Their laid-back parenting style is way more appealing than that of nerve-jangled Julia, smug Amanda or token dad Kevin. Liz is all about sarcasm, self-medicating and savvy shortcuts. Meg swishes stylishly around by day, then blows off steam by night. They are the sharp, fun kind of mum, who would just get better the older you got – when you could have a pub trip with this pair bitching about the rest of the parents. Sure, Edie Falco’s high-maintenance mafia wife had the odd platonic affair and a ferocious temper. But, who wouldn’t want 24/7 access to a vast double-fronted fridge stuffed with baked pasta, cannolis, tiramisu, Italian cold cuts and San Pellegrino? No wonder Father Phil “had a jones for” Carm’s baked ziti. The porcine matriarch deserves a damehood for putting up with hapless chump Daddy Pig. Voiced by Morwenna Banks, the endlessly patient oinker juggles parenting duties with an unspecified job which involves hammering away at a computer keyboard. She somehow also finds time to volunteer for the mummies’ fire service. Guess who starts most of the fires she puts out? Yes, her hopeless ham husband. Let’s hope there’s soon an entire episode of her jumping in muddy puddles to celebrate a divorce. Soothing Kennedy, more like. The former Erinsborough High principal, played by Jackie Woodburne, is the longest-running female character in Neighbours history for a reason – everyone loves her. She has survived amnesia, MS, dodgy haircuts and her husband Karl’s infidelity – and been mother hen to all of Ramsay Street throughout. Strewth, darl, we’ll miss her when the Aussie soap ends this summer. Rack off, TV execs, you dags. Last year’s word-of-mouth Netflix gem followed the struggles of scrabbling writer Alex (Margaret Qualley) as she left her abusive boyfriend, moved into a shelter with two-year-old daughter Maddy and got a job cleaning houses near Seattle. Amid the demoralising poverty and deeply flawed characters, utter devotion to adorable toddler Maddy shone through. Bonus points for Qualley’s real-life mother Andie MacDowell playing her screen mother. It’s a maternal full house. Call her mother. The grande dame of drag might not be your regular parent but Mama Ru has mentored hundreds of queens to stardom. Can I get an amen up in here? “Get the hell away from my daughter,” she told Spike, wielding an axe and ready to use it. “Nobody lays a hand on my little girl.” Go, Joyce. Played by Kristine Sutherland, Buffy’s art gallery manager mum took all the Hellmouth stuff in her pant-suited stride. She became surrogate mother to the entire Scooby gang, so her death from a brain tumour in season five broke their hearts, not to mention ours. When Xander and Dawn later had a daughter, they named her Joyce. Stop it, you’ll set me off again. The Oxo mum (Lynda Bellingham in the Oxo ads), Pam Shipman (Gavin and Stacey), Sophia Petrillo (The Golden Girls), Peggy Mitchell (EastEnders), Clair Huxtable (The Cosby Show), Jackie Goodman (Friday Night Dinner) Which TV mums have we unforgivably missed?
