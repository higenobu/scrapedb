1/23/2022,"Tennis Australia’s chief executive, Craig Tiley, has dismissed suggestions that Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic may sue the organisation and has claimed the world No 1 will be back at the Australian Open in 2023. Tiley has maintained a low profile since Djokovic was deported a week ago. However, on Sunday, he spoke to ABC TV and said Djokovic was not considering taking legal action against Tennis Australia over its role in the saga.  “No,” he said when asked if Tennis Australia was being sued. “I mean there is going to be lots of reports on different things but we are in a position where we are focused on delivering an event right now and we will continue to deliver a great event.” The beleaguered chief executive also replied “Yes” when asked if Djokovic would be back in Australia for the 2023 tournament. “Obviously, I think he’s got to play out this year, but that will be his intention. At the end of the day, he’s the No 1 player in the world and he loves the Australian Open.” Use of the immigration minister’s power to cancel a visa – as happened in Djokovic’s case – comes with a three-year ban on re-entering Australia, except in compelling circumstances, such as compassionate or Australian national interest grounds. On Thursday, the Sun in the UK reported that Djokovic was considering suing the Australian government over his detention, arguing it amounted to ill-treatment. Tennis Australia and a board of medical experts connected with the Victorian state government granted Djokovic an exemption to participate in the tournament despite him not being vaccinated against Covid on the basis he had recently recovered from the virus. However, the federal government disagreed and border force cancelled Djokovic’s visa after he arrived at Melbourne airport on 5 January. The tennis star was forced into immigration detention while he challenged the decision in the courts – initially having a win in the federal circuit court – but he was ultimately deported last Sunday night after failing in his bid to overturn the minister’s decision. Speaking to the ABC on Sunday, Tiley refused to say why his organisation seemingly ignored letters from federal health authorities that clearly stated that “people who contracted Covid-19 within the past six months and seek to enter Australia from overseas and have not received two doses of an [TGA] approved … vaccine are not considered fully vaccinated”. Tiley declined to answer directly, but he suggested at the time decisions were being made about Djokovic’s participation, the Covid rules and conditions were frequently changing. “It’s important to know we have always tried to do the right thing … We were at the beginning of Omicron and that’s why we were constantly seeking clarity and there was a lot of complexity and contradiction of information before, after and there continues to be all the way through,” he said. Tiley implied the letters from the federal government in November 2021 did not paint a full picture of all the conversations Tennis Australia had with the commonwealth concerning unvaccinated players. “We tried to do the right thing … leading into the event were forever-changing conditions. You seek clarity, and one or two bits of communication doesn’t define all the amounts of communication that continued to go on leading into the event.” Despite being jeered by crowds at the Australian Open earlier this week, Tiley has stated that he has no intention of stepping down over the Djokovic deportation scandal. Tiley was asked if, after all his communications with the federal government, he was “shocked” when Djokovic was detained at the Melbourne airport and taken into immigration detention. “Yes. I think what we constantly sought was clarity because our goal is always to do the right thing,” he said. “To make sure that Victorians are safe.”",Sport/Sport,Craig Tiley says Novak Djokovic not suing Tennis Australia and will return for 2023 Australian Open,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/23/craig-tiley-says-novak-djokovic-not-suing-tennis-australia-and-will-return-for-2023-australian-open
1/23/2022,"Emma Thompson gives us a very personal, emotionally generous and intimate performance in this entertaining theatrical two-hander from screenwriter Katy Brand and director Sophie Hyde. Despite some moments of sentimentality and naivety, it is really watchable and conceived with a flair for commanding the audience’s attention. It’s not exactly right to call it a crowd-pleaser, but Brand – who has her own record in comedy writing and performance – has a comic’s sense of how and where to elicit an audience response.  Thompson plays Nancy, a middle-aged widow and former RE teacher who after a lifetime of unsatisfying conjugal relations with just the one man (her late husband) has decided to pay for discreet afternoon sex in an upmarket Norwich hotel room.With her brisk and schoolteacherly need for education and self-betterment, Nancy feels that she needs to experience some more sex before her death, including the most important and climactic sexual experience of all. Thompson makes her a cousin of sorts to the woman who secretly cries in the bathroom in Love Actually, because Alan Rickman is cheating on her, and to the nurse who had sex with Jeff Goldblum in The Tall Guy.Daryl McCormack (Isaiah Jesus from TV’s Peaky Blinders), enigmatically plays the young man she has hired online who goes by “Leo Grande”. Until relatively recently, “escort” was the term used if you wanted to avoid the p-word, but Leo, of course, with un self-consciously polite professionalism, uses “sex worker”.Leo has the tolerant, smilingly indulgent manner of a therapist who has seen and heard it all, or a concierge in a cool boutique hotel who can procure anything you like as Nancy babblingly confesses to him her unhappiness, her disappointment with her children and with herself, and her one frustrated moment of sexual rapture on holiday in Greece when she was 20. She is torn between delaying or abandoning this whole absurd idea and the need to get on with the sex right now (“I can’t bear the suspense!”) And, in fact, the audience might share that impatience, as it is the depiction of bought sex itself which is going to test this movie, rather than lines of bittersweet dialogue.As for Leo, Nancy says: “You’re some sort of sex saint – are you real?” And again, we might well wonder the same thing. Just as the customer in the bought sex transaction is the one with the power and the capital, so Thompson’s character is the one with the wealth of backstory, and Leo sometimes seems blank, almost like a Stepfordian robot. We are waiting for Leo’s serenely trouble-free manner to crack, and of course crack it does, but the film refuses the traditional explanatory revelation of unhappiness, and shows us that some people selling sex can and do remain happy. The movie is at its strongest in showing us the eerie process of Nancy losing her inhibitions as she gets to be Leo’s regular: not her sexual inhibitions, but her personal inhibitions. Thompson shows how her miserable need to abase herself before Leo, her confessional wretchedness, evaporates as her bossy, conceited teacherly mannerisms rise to the surface. She becomes more confident and the unlovely reactionary side to her comes to the fore, allowing her id free rein – even declaring that what the younger generation needs is a good war to burn off all that excess energy. Of course, the thought experiment can’t be avoided: what if this was a middle-aged man with a younger female sex worker? What if it was Bill Nighy on screen with a not-as-famous female star? It naturally wouldn’t be the same; the tone would shift away from comedy, but that is because the power relations of gender affect the bought-sex experience, as they affect every other kind of experience. Perhaps Good Luck to You, Leo Grande does not aspire to a piercingly profound analysis of sex and the human condition. It is, however, an amusing, compassionate and humane drama acted and directed with terrific panache. Good Luck to You, Leo Grande is showing at the Sundance film festival and will be released later this year",Arts/Film,"Good Luck to You, Leo Grande – Emma Thompson hires sex worker in charming comedy",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/22/good-luck-to-you-leo-grande-emma-thompson
