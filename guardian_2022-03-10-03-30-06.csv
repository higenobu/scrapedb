3/10/2022,"At the start of the week, the Home Office boasted of unprecedented action, declaring breathlessly: “The UK government’s Ukraine family scheme is the first visa scheme in the world to launch since President Putin’s invasion of Ukraine.” It was a telling assertion, not only because it is the sort of casually misleading claim we have grown used to from the home secretary, Priti Patel, and Boris Johnson, but also because it expresses a broader truth about the UK’s treatment of refugees. The statement was factually true – but only because Ukrainians do not need visas to enter the European Union, and the UK had to be strong-armed into broadening its restrictive definition of “close relatives”. More than 2 million people have escaped the war, but the UK has accepted only 760 of 22,000 applications so far. A second scheme, yet to begin, will allow individuals and organisations to sponsor Ukrainians – again, cherrypicking victims of war rather than respecting the international convention setting out their rights. Ms Patel spoke of a new humanitarian route, only for Downing Street to swiftly rule that out. As with the asylum system overall, the approach is grudging, inefficient and overly bureaucratic, in large part because it is designed to keep people out. What meagre help is being offered has been dogged by confusion and contradiction. The home secretary promised she had “surged a Home Office team” to help at Calais, but families who had travelled over a thousand miles found a few officials giving out packets of crisps, and were told to go to Paris or Brussels to apply. Then a new “pop-up” centre in Lille, still 70 miles from Calais, was announced; it now appears that it will neither take walk-in applications nor offer appointments but deal with biometrics for the “most vulnerable” of these traumatised people. One Ukrainian mother and daughter made eight trips to the UK visa processing centre in Paris, two trips to the British consulate there and one trip to the British embassy. Even after obtaining the correct visas, they were detained for a second time by UK Border Force officials in Calais. Plenty of refugees could testify to the incompetence and inhumanity of the UK’s asylum system. The difference this time is that across Europe, including in places previously extremely hostile to migrants and refugees, there is greater public sympathy for white Europeans fleeing their homes. The meanness of the UK government’s approach is not new; it is more visible this time, however, because it is not only out of step with domestic public opinion but strikingly at odds with the welcome now offered by other nations. Moldova, one of the poorest countries in Europe, with a population of just 4 million, has taken more than 80,000 Ukrainians. The UK’s failure to help Ukrainian refugees is not an accident, though its ineptitude has worsened the plight of many. It is possible to have a humane and efficient asylum system, but not when you promote stereotypes of refugees as a threat and a burden. The government has closed off safe routes – while its nationality and borders bill seeks to criminalise those who arrive here by irregular means. Ukrainians are the latest victims of its cruelty.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the UK’s shameful treatment of Ukrainians: not an accident | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/09/the-guardian-view-on-the-uks-shameful-treatment-of-ukrainians-not-an-accident
3/10/2022,"Waitrose and Aldi are to stop selling disposable BBQs because of their impact on the natural environment and wildlife. As the weather gets hotter, British people flock to the supermarket to buy the foil devices, so they can sit in parks or gardens and sizzle sausages. But many have raised environmental concerns about this behaviour. National parks including the New Forest have banned them already, because of the risk of wildfires they cause. They usually contain charcoal, which is normally not sustainably sourced, leading to deforestation, as well as single-use plastic. Disposable barbecues can’t be recycled or composted, meaning that for each one sold in the UK – where sales are estimated at over a million each year – there is new waste committed to landfill. Aldi has stopped selling them, which will save approximately 35 tonnes of single-use waste packaging a year. Liz Fox, corporate responsibility director at Aldi UK, said: “We are committed to reducing our impact on the environment and know that many of our shoppers are increasingly looking to do the same. “We hope customers can embrace our latest move and still want them to enjoy their summer picnics and barbecues. “As an alternative, we would encourage customers to opt for more environmentally friendly and sustainable options such as mini portable barbecues, ensuring they are used responsibly.” Before summer, all of Waitrose’s stores will stop selling the disposable grills. They estimate this will save about 70,000 disposable bbqs from being sold a year, saving 73.5 tonnes worth of foil and 11.2 tonnes of shrink-wrap plastic being produced a year. Lucy Comer, buying assistant at Waitrose, said: “Disposable BBQs present a risk to our natural habitats and this is why we’ve committed to removing them from our shelves this year. “This is the right thing to do to preserve our local ecosystems and another example of the work we’re doing to protect the planet. We applaud Aldi for standing with us to make this happen and we hope other retailers will follow.” The government has welcomed the move. Amanda Craig, director of people & nature at Natural England, said: “We welcome any step that helps people act more responsibly while enjoying the countryside, and encourage everyone to follow the Countryside Code when spending time outdoors. “This includes only using BBQs in places where signs specify they are permitted, to better protect people, property and wildlife”.",News/Environment,Waitrose and Aldi to stop selling disposable BBQs,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/09/waitrose-and-aldi-to-stop-selling-disposable-bbqs
3/10/2022,"Krzysztof Mikucki was so enraged by the treatment of his Ukrainian family by UK Border Force staff in Calais at 1am on Wednesday that he struggled to find words to articulate his fury. “They treated us worse than the water in the toilet,” the Polish builder said finally, standing by the entrance to the ferry port hours later with his Ukrainian wife, Alona, sister-in-law Juliia, a speech therapist, mother-in-law Olga and their dog Garik, considering what to do next. Mikucki’s relatives are among about 600 Ukrainians who have been turned away by British border officials in Calais in the last 10 days at the end of a 2,000-mile journey fleeing Russia’s invasion of their country. Many are staying in a crowded youth hostel in the French port city, trying to secure visa appointments in Paris and Brussels, upset and angry to have been forced to halt their already gruelling odyssey while they work out how to reroute to satisfy UK visa requirements. On Tuesday night all the rooms in the youth hostel were full. One man who had spent seven days driving across Europe with his family from the heavily shelled city of Kharkiv, and who had also been turned back at the UK border control, spent the night sleeping outside the building, squeezed into his car with his wife and six children aged between two and 16. At about 7am the next day he wound down his window and would only say: “Things are very bad for us.” Natacha Bouchart, the Calais mayor, visited the youth hostel to voice strong criticism of Britain’s refusal to lift visa requirements for Ukrainians. “The British authorities are not displaying a humanitarian attitude,” she said. “It is not enough to say that they are welcoming Ukrainian refugees, they need to put everything in place to make it technically possible for them to secure visas, or provisionally cancel the need for visa and create a system that would allow them to apply on arrival in the UK.” Some families staying at the youth hostel were politely puzzled at the UK immigration officials’ failure to be more helpful, others were despairingly incredulous, but Mikucki was shouting with fury, exhausted after his 4,000-mile round-trip to Ukraine and not quite back. After picking his relatives up from the Romanian border, Mikucki had hoped to take them by ferry to Dover and then to his home in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, but they were held at British passport control for four and a half hours. Officials finally concluded that the family would need to leave the port and apply for visas. “The Border Force staff were chatting about their houses, laughing, while we sat on a bench waiting. At 5.30am they just gave us a piece of paper with a phone number on it,” Mikucki said. His mother-in-law Olga’s house in Mykolaiv, southern Ukraine, was shelled by Russian forces on Friday and she fled with her belongings packed into a suitcase. She seemed still in shock, and surprised to have been turned away at the border. “It feels hurtful at a time when we are so in need of support,” she said. French police helped the family to find a hotel, where they slept for five hours before returning to the port to seek guidance from a hastily set up Home Office advice centre – staffed by seven workers, who are unable to process visas and seemed equipped to do little more than counsel Ukrainians on whether they should drive back to Paris or divert to Brussels. There were no Ukrainian translators to help the many people who were struggling with the visa application form, which is available only in English. British officials said they had turned away between 50 and 60 people at the Calais border every day since the conflict erupted because they did not have a visa. A small new visa application centre will open on Thursday in Lille but UK officials are still encouraging Ukrainians to head to Paris or Brussels to make applications, and said appointments were available. Asked to respond to the refugees’ frustration, officials said that since there was a visa scheme in operation, applications had to be processed, but they were trying to speed up the system. The Home Office said it had now issued 850 visas to Ukrainians seeking to join family in the UK and was processing 22,000 applications. Officials have said they do not want to set up a visa processing centre in Calais, to avoid encouraging more refugees to travel to the city, which has for years been a gathering place for people hoping to seek asylum in the UK. Refugee charities based in Calais said there were no Ukrainians staying in the informal camps occupied by people from Syria, Afghanistan, Sudan and Iraq. Volunteers have pointed to a double standard in the way Ukrainian refugees are being housed and fed by the French government, compared with the more hostile treatment meted out to those fleeing other conflicts. On Wednesday afternoon French officials brought two buses to the youth hostel and drove about 40 Ukrainian refugees to hostels in other cities, but they would not reveal where. After describing his difficulties in detail to the BBC and the Sun, Misha Raminishvili, a British scaffolder from Hornchurch in east London trying to bring his Ukrainian family to safety, received a phone call saying a visa appointment in Belgium would be brought forward by five days. “I was angry when we were turned away,” he said, helping his son, six, and stepdaughter, 16, into the car to set off on the three-hour drive to Brussels. “Now I’m tired. I understand they weren’t as prepared as they should have been, everything takes time. I feel disappointed to be honest.” He was still not clear how long it would take to get home because officials said processing the visa could take up to five days. Mohamed Sheet, an economics student, and Vitalia Sheeta, a shop assistant, were distraught to have been turned away at the UK border after a difficult journey from Kyiv, hoping to join an uncle in Manchester. “We’re trying to work out how to get from here to Paris. It’s so confusing,” she said. Tatiana Osadchuk, 26, a trainee nurse from Chernivtsi, was travelling with her 16-year-old brother Victor and her mother, Lesia Osadchuk, a gardener, hoping to join family in Reading. “We spent £130 each on bus tickets in Romania, to London. They told us there would be no problem at the border but about 20 Ukrainian refugees were taken off the bus at the ferry port. I’m strong, so for me it’s OK, but it’s harder for older people. My mother is scared that we won’t get the visa, and then we don’t know what we will do.” A government spokesperson said it had “taken urgent action to process visas at speed for all those eligible to the Ukraine family scheme, while carrying out vital security checks”. They said: “We have protected appointments at all of our visa application centres to ensure there is sufficient capacity and deployed extra staff to help people through the process as quickly as possible. In light of the risk from criminals actively operating in the area around Calais, we have set up a new temporary visa application centre in Lille.”",News/UK news,Anger and exhaustion as Ukrainians turned away by UK in Calais ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/09/anger-and-exhaustion-as-ukrainians-turned-away-by-uk-in-calais
3/10/2022,"The Endurance left South Georgia for Antarctica on 5 December 1914. Onboard were 27 crew members plus a stowaway, 69 dogs and one cat. Sir Ernest Shackleton, the expedition leader, was aiming to establish a base on Antarctica’s Weddell Sea coast and then keep going to the Ross Sea on the other side of the continent. Within two days, the ship encountered the barrier of thick sea ice around the Antarctic continent. For several weeks, the Endurance made painstaking progress, but in mid-January a gale pushed the ice floes hard against one another and the ship was stuck – “frozen like an almond in the middle of a chocolate bar”, according to crewman Thomas Orde-Lees. The men could do nothing but wait. After nine months of being beset in ice, they abandoned the badly damaged ship, decamping on to the ice. From the ship they took food, bibles, books, clothing, tools, keepsakes and – crucially – three open lifeboats. The cat and some of the dogs were shot. A few weeks later, on 21 November 1915, almost a year after they had set out, the Endurance finally sank. Using basic navigational tools, Frank Worsley, the ship’s captain and navigator, recorded its location. Without that information, it would almost certainly never have been found. The men formed a plan to march across the ice towards land. But after travelling just seven and a half miles (12km) in seven days, they gave up. “There was no alternative but to camp once more on the floe and to possess our souls with what patience we could till conditions should appear more favourable for a renewal of the attempt to escape,” wrote Shackleton. When the ice broke up the following April, the crew took to the lifeboats, rowing to Elephant Island, a remote and uninhabited outcrop. The men were exhausted, some afflicted by seasickness, others convulsed with dysentery. “At least half the party were insane,” wrote Frank Wild, Shackleton’s second in command. But they made it. On 15 April they clambered ashore on Elephant Island. It was the first time the men had stood on solid ground in almost 500 days. After nine days of recuperation, Shackleton, Worsley and four others took one of the boats another 8oo miles (1,300km) across rough seas and in biting winds to South Georgia. “The boat tossed interminably on the big waves under grey, threatening skies. Every surge of the sea was an enemy to be watched and circumvented,” wrote Shackleton. It took 16 days to reach their destination. It was an extraordinary feat of survival, but their epic journey was not yet over. Three of the men, including Shackleton, then crossed South Georgia’s peaks and glaciers to reach a whaling station on the other side of the island. In August, after several failed attempts, a rescue party set out for Elephant Island, where the remaining 22 crewmen were waiting. In early 1922, Shackleton launched a new expedition to the Antarctic. On 5 January, while his ship was docked at South Georgia, he died of a heart attack, aged 47.",News/Science,Lost and found: the story of Shackleton’s Endurance expedition,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/mar/09/lost-and-found-story-of-shackleton-endurance-expedition
3/10/2022,"British American Tobacco will continue selling cigarettes in Russia, defying a gathering movement among global brands to halt operations there in response to the invasion of Ukraine. The London-based cigarette manufacturer, whose brands include Lucky Strike and Rothmans, said it would “continue to operate” in Russia, one of its key growth markets for cigarettes and heated tobacco, according to the company’s latest annual report. It will suspend capital investment and scale back marketing and business activities but stopped short of following its smaller British rival, Imperial Brands, by halting its operations altogether. Some of the world’s largest consumer goods companies, including Nestlé, Unilever, Coca-Cola, Starbucks and McDonald’s, have put Russian units on hold, prompting a warning from a senior Kremlin official that their operations could be nationalised. In a statement, British American Tobacco (BAT) said its business in Ukraine had been suspended for safety reasons. “We are deeply concerned about the conflict in Ukraine. The safety and wellbeing of our people there and across the region is our first priority. We have full local establishments of 1,000 people in Ukraine and 2,500 in Russia. Our thoughts are with them all at this incredibly difficult time. “In Ukraine, we have suspended all business and manufacturing operations and are providing all the support and assistance we can to our colleagues, including relocation and temporary accommodation. Our businesses bordering Ukraine are providing assistance to the humanitarian relief effort.” But the tobacco company said it would not follow other companies’ lead by suspending its Russian business voluntarily and would instead abide by sanctions. “In Russia, we have a full establishment of our people right across the country, including substantial local manufacturing. Our business in Russia continues to operate. As a key principle we have a duty of care to all our employees at this extremely complicated and uncertain time for them and their families. “We have suspended all planned capital investment into Russia and will focus on our portfolio of locally produced tobacco products – including our heated tobacco products. “Furthermore, we are scaling our business activities appropriate to the current situation, including rationalising our marketing activities.”",News/Business,British American Tobacco to continue selling cigarettes in Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/09/british-american-tobacco-continue-selling-cigarettes-russia-rothmans-sanctions
3/10/2022,"A landowner is facing legal action for what environmental regulators say is the decimation of a protected river. Natural England and the Environment Agency (EA) say the charges against the landowner include causing damage to a site of special scientific interest (SSSI), carrying out clearance and reprofiling of the riverbank which was likely to cause damage to or endanger the stability of the river and allowing silt to discharge into the river. The agencies investigated the actions at the River Lugg near Kingsland, Herefordshire, after complaints that clearance was taking place along the bank in December 2020. The agencies were alerted after reports of activities including dredging, illegal felling of trees and profiling of the riverbanks over nearly a mile (1.5km) of the river. The officials, along with the police, issued a stop notice to the landowner to halt the works, which the local wildlife trust said had devastated the river and would have dire consequences for wildlife and water quality. After a long investigation, the EA and Natural England said on Wednesday they had begun legal action. The charges also relate to further works which are alleged to have been carried out by the landowner in December 2021. Oliver Harmar, the chief operating officer at Natural England, said: “The decimation of this section of the River Lugg has been devastating to the local environment and to local people, destroying the habitats of iconic wildlife such as otters, kingfisher and salmon. It was heartbreaking to see this beautiful riverside illegally damaged.” The area is protected as an SSSI owing to its importance for nature. Consent is required before any works are carried out within an SSSI, which had not been granted, the agencies said.",News/Environment,Landowner facing legal action over ‘decimation’ of Herefordshire river,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/09/landowner-facing-legal-action-over-decimation-of-herefordshire-river
3/10/2022,"I had involvement with residential childcare for over 40 years, from the early 1960s until I retired. While your editorial (6 March) is correct, it highlights issues that have been around since I started. Regularly, improvements and revisions made in children’s homes are overturned as the next round of spending cuts arrives. From the passing of the Children Act in 1989 until the early 2000s, there was some progress. We now seem to be reversing many of the strides that have been made, taking money from young people looked after by the state to assist in cutting taxes for the more fortunate. You also highlight the scandals that have covered a range of issues from child abuse to financial abuse, all of which mean that children in care suffer more neglect rather than compensation for that which they have already suffered. This is often reflected in the behaviour of these young people, who then gain a negative public image which many politicians feel justifies not investing in them. Some young people cared for by the state may now receive little support beyond ages 15 or 16. It is not a system that needs tweaking or simply more money, but restructuring in such a way that reflects normal family care and support as much as possible, and then, as you say, tough regulation to ensure it is happening.Roy GrimwoodMarket Drayton, Shropshire  That most children’s homes are run by profit-seeking companies is scandalous. Numerous inquiries have highlighted the failures of our care system for children, and in 2015 David Cameron called for a “root and branch” review, but still there’s been no real improvement. Residential care continues to be an amateur service. If you appear to be reasonably caring and unlikely to abuse your charges, you can get a job. GPs have to complete at least four years of training, a solicitor six years, and the vet who treats your dog has a five-year qualification. Yet our most vulnerable children are cared for by people who are not required to have any previous relevant training. Kindness and common sense alone cannot address the distressing problems that children in homes exhibit. Few have a plan to treat the reasons they are in the home, and, if they do, it is unlikely to be fully implemented. Few even receive regular sessions with a qualified counsellor. The annual cost for one child averages up to £200,000, yet half of prisoners under the age of 25 have been in care. Figures for mental illness and homelessness are equally grim. Ownership and regulation of homes needs to be addressed, but will not solve their continuing failure to meet the needs of the children they exist to serve. I still await “root and branch” reform.Mel WoodSwords, County Dublin, Ireland  Yes, care standards must be raised, but the systemic failures of England’s care system are much deeper than just the role of private providers. The alarming example of Robert McGuinness (Report, 3 March) is one symptom of a care system in crisis. And it’s in crisis partly because of decades of underinvestment in children’s social care, which has enabled unacceptable levels of instability for children in and leaving care (7,230 children moved placement more than three times in 2021). The Independent Review of Children’s Social Care must tackle these root issues boldly in its incoming recommendations. And the government must commit to funding that enables the seismic change that’s desperately needed.Katharine Sacks-JonesCEO, Become  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

For too long, those in positions of power at the highest echelons of the global sporting ecosystem have cosied up to authoritarian regimes and brutal dictators, turned their heads away from the plight of fellow human beings as their rights have been withheld or curtailed, and allowed commercial interest to trump common interest. But this time sport has been forced to pick a side, and really mean it. Fuelled by overwhelming global public outrage and the uniting spirit of solidarity with the Ukrainian people, governing bodies, clubs, teams, sponsors and athletes have been asked to wield their power and influence to do whatever they can to bring about peace, draw attention to the need for safe routes for all those fleeing the conflict, and promote wider condemnation and ostracism of Putin’s regime. Sport’s only utility to wider society is when it lives true to its stated values – when it acts to make the world a better place and dares to speak up and speak out in support of the universal principles upon which it is based. Sport must never be allowed to peddle the lie that its strength lies in cowardly nods to “neutrality”. It doesn’t now; it never has; it never will.

This phrase is an example of the way in which de-sexing language can lead to an inaccurate picture. There is no “parenthood pay gap”. Social scientists have shown that motherhood plays a substantial role in the pay deficit that women suffer compared with men.

3/10/2022,"My mother, Kathleen Baker, who has died aged 87, had two careers – as a marriage guidance counsellor and then as a scriptwriter for three highly popular TV series, Crown Court, Brookside and Emmerdale, during the 1970s, 80s and 90s. Born in Oldham, she was the daughter of Jessie (nee Hilton), a nursing auxiliary, and Percy Potter, an engineer, and always held her northern roots close to her heart. She first went to Middleton grammar school in Oldham and then Luton girls’ high school in Bedfordshire, the family having moved to Luton when she was 12. In 1956 she gained a botany degree at St Hilda’s College, Oxford, and married Howard Baker, a stage manager with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Following my birth in Stratford-upon-Avon, in 1960 they settled in Sale, Manchester, where Roselyn, Vikki and our brother, Fenton, were born at home. Five years later they moved to a dilapidated and ramshackle house in Hale, Cheshire, and Olivia was born. It was the house in which Kathleen eventually died. She began training with the Marriage Guidance Council (now Relate), starting her work as a counsellor in 1975. Howard had a job with Granada TV, working on Coronation Street when it was first broadcast live, and in the late 70s Kathleen decided to get into television too. She first wrote scripts, credited under her maiden name, Kathleen Potter, for Crown Court (1978-84), continuing with her counselling work at the same time, and then moved full-time on to work on Brookside (1984-92), finally writing 20 episodes of Emmerdale (1994-95), after which she retired. She was chosen to represent the Marriage Guidance Council at the funeral of the Princess of Wales in 1997, and was appointed MBE in 2001 for her services to counselling. Following Howard’s death in 1993 and a difficult decade, Kathleen rekindled her friendship from their Oxford days with Michael Grindrod, who became her partner. In her later years she revelled in her garden, and she and Michael travelled widely. She is survived by Michael, her five children, 13 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.",Arts/Television & radio,Kathleen Baker obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/09/kathleen-baker-obituary
