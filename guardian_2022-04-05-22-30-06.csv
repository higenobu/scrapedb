4/5/2022,"Now this is a sentence I didn’t expect to find myself writing: last week I paid to watch two hours of intergenerational amateur community dance. There were white-haired women in leggings dancing with wooden spoons; a dancer with mobility issues sitting on a chair, surrounded by people in green T-shirts; a new mum snapping her body and stamping her feet over the nappies, toys and phone chargers she’d emptied out of her rucksack. I drank tepid white wine out of a plastic cup; a woman played the cello while a loose collaboration of human bodies rolled and jerked across an empty stage. And do you know what? It was brilliant. I loved it. But here’s the thing: if I had watched that same piece of dance 20, even 10 years ago, I would have squirmed in my seat. I would have raised a cynical eyebrow, curled a lip, spent the whole thing with one eye on the audience, terrified and self-conscious in case anyone caught me enjoying it. I’d have been waiting for the gotcha moment when some nameless arbiter of cool – smelling of cigarettes, in a leather jacket, hair tousled and clothes confusing – would have jumped out from behind a fold-down maroon chair and whispered: “You like this, you fool! You have been tricked. This isn’t cool – this is embarrassing!’ And I would have been run out of the building with a pitchfork. If I could go back and tell my 18-year-old self one thing … well, actually, if I could go back and tell my 18-year-old self one thing, it would probably be to never go on the pill. Or maybe to try harder to keep Gordon Brown as prime minister. OK, so if I could go back and tell my 18-year-old self three things, one of them would definitely be to take joy in joy. I would pull that girl up by her unflattering toothbrush fringe, wipe off her unnecessary blusher and tell her that it is far more impressive to love things than to be snide. Being cynical, being cruel, being deprecating and being negative are easy. It takes about 0.08% of effort to cut something down. Cheap laughs don’t warm your feet and hitting easy targets doesn’t improve your aim. It is altogether more impressive and satisfying to be enthusiastic about things. To be a fan. To encourage. To commit. It doesn’t even really matter what it is – fixing bikes, Zumba, making model planes, running, local history, whatever tickles your pickle. The fact is that someone doing a thing they are genuinely passionate about is immeasurably more sexy than someone making snide remarks about other people’s passions. Perhaps this is what age means. Perhaps this is why a 38-year-old woman, despite her melting body, raft of responsibilities and lifetime of disappointments, is often so much happier than her 18-year-old counterpart. Because under the flurry of laundry, doctor’s appointments, work calls, electricity bills and mysterious new lumps, you simply do not have the time or energy to give a shit about what other people think. Without the horned devil of wanting to be accepted whispering in your ear every waking minute, you are free to love the things you love. You can be bad at things you try or take pleasure in things deemed marginal and eccentric without constantly worrying that you will be made a pariah by those with higher social status. You can, ironically, belong. After nearly three decades of taking the piss, I now recognise that effort, community, imperfection and hope are the most impressive things we have. They keep our heads above water and put meaning in our bones. So, that night, when the dancers invited the audience up on stage at the end, I stood up. I jumped at the chance. I whirled around a little black room, outside London, in a pair of secondhand trousers, with middle-aged men and girls half my age and had a ball. Maybe it’s age, maybe it’s a stage, but right now I would much rather be leaping about than standing at the edge of a dancefloor, in a dark club, watching who is watching me.

4/5/2022,"Twitter has announced it is appointing Elon Musk to its board the day after the world’s richest person was revealed to be the social media platform’s biggest shareholder with a 9.2% stake. Parag Agrawal, the Twitter chief executive, said on Tuesday that he was “excited” to share that Musk was joining the company’s board of directors. “Through conversations with Elon in recent weeks, it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our board,” he said in a tweet. Agrawal said Musk was both a “passionate believer and intense critic” of the service and that was “exactly what we need on @Twitter, and in the boardroom, to make us stronger in the long term”. I’m excited to share that we’re appointing @elonmusk to our board! Through conversations with Elon in recent weeks, it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our Board. Musk, who has more than 80 million followers on Twitter, said he was “looking forward to working” with the board “to make significant improvements to Twitter in coming months”. Looking forward to working with Parag & Twitter board to make significant improvements to Twitter in coming months! In a regulatory filing on Tuesday Twitter said it had entered into an agreement with Musk to “serve as a class II director with a term expiring at the company’s 2024 annual meeting of stockholders”. On Monday it emerged that Musk had taken an almost $3bn (£2.3bn) stake in Twitter, a holding more than four times the 2.25% of the site’s co-founder, Jack Dorsey. The company said Musk, either alone or as a member of a group, will not be allowed to own more than 14.9% of Twitter’s outstanding stock for as long as he is a board member and for 90 days after. The boss of Tesla and SpaceX, who with 80.4 million followers ranks in the global top 10 of the most popular users on the microblogging site, paid $2.89bn for the stake at Twitter’s closing share price on Friday. The company’s shares soared by 27% on Monday on the back of the news, adding about $8bn to its market value. In pre-market trading on Tuesday the shares were up 7% to just under $50, valuing the company at about $40bn. Musk, whose personal fortune is estimated at $289bn – almost $100bn more than the world’s next richest person, the Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos – has often found himself in trouble for tweeting contentious remarks. The Tesla boss’s many questionable Twitter moments include calling Vernon Unsworth, a diver who helped rescue a team of young football players stuck in a flooded cave in Thailand, “pedo guy” after he criticised Musk’s plan to save them with a submarine. Musk eventually deleted the tweets and apologised to Unsworth, who sued for $190m in damages for the tweets. The jury found the Tesla boss did not defame Unsworth, and after the verdict Musk told reporters in the hallway of the courtroom: “My faith in humanity is restored.” Musk has also found himself in trouble with the US financial markets regulator, the SEC, for posting tweets that have had significant ramifications for the companies he runs. In 2018, he posted that he had “secured” funding to take Tesla private, a move that resulted in the SEC requiring Musk to get pre-approval for certain public communications relating to the electric car company’s share price. Musk settled with the SEC, paying a $20m fine and stepping down as Tesla’s chairman, while saying it was “harassment” and an “unjustified action”. While he was under investigation by the SEC he smoked marijuana on a live web show, which resulted in a 6% fall in Tesla’s share price and the departure of two of its senior executives.",News/Technology,Elon Musk to join Twitter board after taking $2.9bn stake,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/05/elon-musk-join-twitter-board-stake-tesla-spacex
4/5/2022,"The Georgia general assembly has passed a bill targeting the discussion of race in schools that also paves the way for transgender students to be banned from playing sport on girls’ teams, after a late-night legislative session on Monday. HB1084 bans the teaching of nine so-called “divisive concepts”, including that the US is “fundamentally racist” and that “one race is inherently superior to another race”. The concepts are almost identical to an executive order signed by former president Donald Trump in 2020, which sought to ban them from federal worker training. The bill also establishes a process for local school boards to vet parents’ complaints over teaching of the concepts. The bill is the latest in a line of state moves seeking to curb the discussion of race in schools and banning critical race theory, an academic discipline that examines the ways in which racism operates in US laws and society which has become a lightning-rod issue for Republicans. Last month in Mississippi, the Republican-controlled legislature passed a vaguely worded bill targeting critical race theory. It was met with unanimous and pointed criticism from Black lawmakers in the state. During a late-night session on Monday, Georgia Republicans added a last-minute measure to the legislation that allows the state’s high school athletics governing body, the Georgia High School Association, to ban transgender girls from competing against other girls in public school sports. An earlier iteration of the bill, which passed the senate but was blocked in the house, sought an outright ban on transgender boys and girls playing on teams that did not match their genders assigned at birth. Georgia house Democrats denounced the last-minute changes. The Democratic house leader, James Beverly, described the measure as an effort to “target trans kids, to ban kids from playing sports, and to attack teachers at the same time”, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “This bill targets the most vulnerable Georgians, transgender youth,” said Matthew Wilson, a Democratic representative quoted in local press. “It sets us up not only to be on the wrong side of history and morality, but on the wrong end of litigation.” But Republican state house speaker David Ralston, who blocked the previous iteration from the Senate, defended the measure, suggesting it did not seek to ban transgender students from playing sports outright. “We’re going to let them [Georgia High School Association] make those determinations,” Ralston told reporters. “And we have an oversight committee on that. But that’s really where these determinations need to be made.” The bill passed the house along partisan lines and will now make its way to the Republican governor, Brian Kemp.",News/Education,Georgia passes bill restricting discussion of race in schools ,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/05/georgia-passes-bill-restricting-discussion-race-schools
4/5/2022,"For some he is exposing Russians to the truth of Vladimir Putin’s war, while to others he is traipsing over the Geneva conventions by parading prisoners of war on the internet. Volodymyr Zolkin, 40, an amateur video blogger before the war, has become a YouTube hit in Ukraine and elsewhere for his 50-plus interviews with captured soldiers and pilots, which he says are an attempt to cut through the censorship to inform Russian families about the fate of relatives. “You [only] have to believe the facts,” Zolkin told the Guardian in an interview via Skype from an undisclosed location. “Russia does not give or show anything. We immediately created an honest YouTube channel. We show everything here – photos, videos, all data. We show real people calling their parents. You don’t need to trust anyone, believe the facts.” There is little doubt about the reach of the videos. The most popular ones have been viewed more than a million times, and the average is 400,000-500,000 views. An hour-long conversation with a Russian pilot, major Alexander Krasnoyartsev, who was involved in the bombing of civilians in the besieged city of Chernihiv has even been given English subtitles. Lawyers have suggested, however, that making and sharing such recordings is likely to be in violation of the third Geneva convention, designed to protect prisoners from humiliation and risks to their safety. “These people are crying and thanking us for what we are doing,” Zolkin said in response. “Sometimes I am asked if we are violating the Geneva conventions. It says – you can not mock the prisoners. Please tell me where the Geneva convention says that you can not do a humanitarian and peacekeeping mission.” It all started, he said, with frustration at the lack of information reaching people in the Russian federation. With the help of a friend, Victor Andrusiv, an adviser to the Minister of Internal Affairs, he started calling the relatives and friends of Russian soldiers who had sought information through a Ukrainian government Telegram channel set up to tell them of the fate of their loved ones. Zolkin called the relatives live on camera and challenged them about the Russian government’s behaviour. “But the Russian special services (FSB) began to send fake phone numbers and fake data of soldiers and spam,” Zolkin claimed. “I would call the mothers but after three days I started listening to standard answers – we are not interested in politics, we know nothing and everything. I realised that mothers were being pressured by Russian special services.” He added: “I said [to the government], give me the opportunity to communicate with the prisoners and let them call their mothers.” His first such interview was on 18 March with 20-year-old soldier, Pavel Kravchenko, who said he had gone to war without any understanding of Putin’s reasons. “We were in a convoy,” he told Zolkin. “When we crossed the border, we asked the commander: ‘What is it for?’ He said: ‘Don’t ask unnecessary questions’. We were surrounded, we didn’t even fight back, we surrendered immediately. The convoy got destroyed immediately. I didn’t want to die. I wanted to live.” Zolkin now interviews around 10 Russian prisoners of war a day in locations across the country, only some of which have been broadcast. The pale, evidently nervous, prisoners are asked to confirm that they have agreed to the interview and its broadcast, before being asked to give an account of their military background and the events that led to their capture, along with their thoughts on the war. YouTube has blocked interviews where evidence is lacking that the interviews are voluntary. The prisoners are then asked to call their family and friends at home. The reasoning is that the mothers of captured soldiers would truly listen to what their sons were saying about the truth about the war, Zolkin said. The majority, he says, are like the first interview he did with Kravchenko. “To be honest, I didn’t know how to prepare for these interviews,” he said. “I came and saw a child in front of me. Among all the people I talked to, 80% are actually children. Some of them left unarmed. Some of them have never shot or been shot at in their lives. No combat training.” He added: “Often a Russian mother does not ask her son about his health, but immediately tells us the propaganda she was told on Russian television. They have a TV instead of a brain.” Zolkin is not aggressive with the prisoners, although he says that he personally believes that Krasnoyartsev, who shot dead a farmer who had tried to take him captive after he was shot down over Chernihiv, is a “mass murderer”. But he added: “I have mixed feelings. On the one hand, I saw that these Russians were in fact children. But on the other hand, I saw Ukrainian civilian children who did not attack anyone. And they are killed. [The Russians] destroy whole houses. You have to understand.”",News/World news,‘Often a Russian mother has a TV for a brain’: Ukraine YouTuber films PoWs calling home ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/often-a-russian-mother-has-a-tv-for-a-brain-ukraine-youtuber-films-pows-calling-home
4/5/2022,"The European court of justice has ruled in favour of a convicted Irish murderer who challenged the country’s use of mobile phone metadata in his conviction, with potential implications for criminal investigations across Europe. The Luxembourg-based court said on Tuesday that Ireland’s system of retaining and accessing mobile phone metadata – which helped secure Graham Dwyer’s conviction – breached European Union law. The ruling said EU law precludes the general and indiscriminate retention of traffic and location data in electronic communications for the purposes of combating serious crime, a judgment that builds on a 2014 landmark ruling that clipped the ability of police and intelligence agencies to mine vast data troves. The decision boosted a long-running effort by Dwyer to overturn his 2015 conviction for the murder of Elaine O’Hara. An outwardly respectable and successful architect, Dwyer killed the childcare worker in August 2012 after grooming her for sadomasochistic fantasies that included stabbing women during sex. He committed what prosecutors called “very nearly the perfect murder” but was caught and sentenced to life in prison after police tracked his movements through texts and phone data. There were no witnesses or physical evidence. Dwyer appealed on the grounds the retention and accessing of his mobile phone data breached EU law. Ireland’s supreme court referred the appeal to the ECJ. Its ruling had been expected given previous rulings that governments and service providers do not have broad rights to retain data on citizens. The court said the combating of crime in the 27-member EU bloc did not justify retaining data that could violate the privacy rights of entire populations. Even particularly serious crimes could not be treated in the same way as threats to national security, it said. However, a genuine or current or foreseeable threat could justify indiscriminate data retention for a limited period of time. Civil liberty campaigners have faulted Ireland for failing to update Irish laws after the 2014 landmark ruling. The Green party’s justice spokesperson, Patrick Costello, said Tuesday’s judgment was no surprise. “Ireland has been repeatedly criticised for our national policies on privacy and data retention by numerous judgments, industry and campaigners.” Dwyer’s appeal will now return to Ireland’s supreme court. Ireland’s justice minister, Helen McEntee, said the government noted the ECJ ruling and awaited further “clarity” when the supreme court ruled on Dwyer’s case.",News/Law,Mobile phone data retention in Graham Dwyer case broke EU law,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/apr/05/mobile-phone-data-retention-in-graham-dwyer-case-broke-eu-law
4/5/2022,"The fossil fuel industry and its influence over policy was the major elephant in the room looming over the release of the third and final report, out this week, from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s leading climate authority. The major source of contention: how do you talk about mitigating climate change without confronting the fossil fuel industry? “It’s like Star Wars without Darth Vader,” says environmental sociologist Robert Brulle, of Brown University. The first two reports, both released over the last year, highlighted the physical science on climate effects and countries’ vulnerability to further warming. But this third report deals more with the potential solutions, which have been a focal point of controversy in recent years for both the fossil fuel industry and the governments of oil-rich nations. Social scientists were successful in pushing for more of their research to be included in the IPCC’s reports, with chapters that touch on everything from debunking claims that less developed countries need fossil fuels to help tackle poverty to a rundown of efforts to block climate policy. The report made one thing abundantly clear: the technologies and policies necessary to adequately address climate change exist, and the only real obstacles are politics and fossil fuel interests. The role of the fossil fuel industry is highlighted throughout the report’s nearly 3,000 pages, but researchers note it was mysteriously absent from the “Summary for Policymakers” – traditionally the first part of the report that’s released and often attracts the most media attention. An earlier draft of the summary leaked to the Guardian, however, described the fossil fuel industry and others invested in a high-carbon economy as “vested interests” that have actively worked against climate policy, noting: “Factors limiting ambitious transformation include structural barriers, an incremental rather than systemic approach, lack of coordination, inertia, lock-in to infrastructure and assets, and lock-in as a consequence of vested interests, regulatory inertia, and lack of technological capabilities and human resources.” Brulle, whose research is cited multiple times in the report, was dismayed to see the cut. “The scientists clearly did their job and provided ample material on climate obstruction activities in the report,” he says. “The political process of creating the Summary for Policymakers ended up editing all of this information out.” Unlike the research-heavy chapters, which are controlled entirely by the scientists who research and write them, the Summary for Policymakers must be approved by government representatives from 195 countries around the world; the approval process for this year’s mitigation report was the longest and most contentious in the history of the IPCC. According to leaked reports, representatives from Saudi Arabia in particular argued for multiple references to carbon capture and storage and the watering down of language on shutting down fossil fuel production. Oil company representatives were also included in this process as both authors and editors of the report, which has been the case since the IPCC began. For the latest report, a senior staffer for Saudi Aramco – Saudia Arabia’s state-owned oil and gas company – was one of the two coordinating lead authors, a position of considerable influence, for the chapter on cross-sector perspectives. A longtime Chevron staffer was also the review editor for the chapter on energy systems. “Obviously, none of this was secret,” notes Julia Steinberger, professor of ecological economics at the University of Lausanne, and a lead author of the section on mitigation pathways compatible with long-term goals. While authors and contributors are required to disclose their affiliations, Steinberger says that contributions from oil industry insiders represent an untenable conflict of interest. “Just because a person fills out forms does not mean that they don’t have other interests at heart that are not reflective of the science and the public interest, but more reflective of their employer.” Despite the influence of oil companies and oil-rich nations, the report does still highlight the fossil fuel industry’s influence on policymaking, and eviscerates some of the industry’s favorite myths. In the new chapter on “Demand, Services and Social Aspects of Mitigation”, for example, researchers challenged the long-held belief that fossil fuel consumption is entirely driven by demand. “What we were able to demonstrate was actually the contrary: there is no sustainable development or development, full stop, possible without climate mitigation,” said Steinberger, who was a contributing author on the chapter. “Unless you mitigate climate, the impacts are going to catch you every step of the way and just make people’s lives increasingly hard and miserable, especially in the global south.” The connection between social justice and climate mitigation is one that runs throughout the report. “People are beginning to realize how serious the climate crisis is, and that the ways to meet the challenges of the climate crisis – moving to low-carbon energy, looking after the environment, shifting transport – tend to also improve energy security, justice, social concerns, there are a lot of win-wins and co-benefits,” says Catherine Mitchell, professor of energy policy at Exeter University, and one of the two coordinating lead authors on the chapter focused on policy. Social scientists hoping to make further inroads into not only the IPCC process, but policymaking more broadly, have a chicken-and-egg problem, according to Dana Fisher, director of the program for society and the environment at the University of Maryland and a contributing author to chapter 13. Fisher’s research focuses on the impact that activism has had on climate policymaking. “We have insufficient funding to support the sort of large-scale research that enables you to have high confidence in your findings,” she says, which limits the amount of social science research that can be used in the report. Less than 1% of research funding on climate from 1990 to 2018 went toward social sciences, including political science, sociology, and economics. That’s despite the fact that even physical scientists themselves agree that inaction on climate will probably not be solved by more scientific evidence. “Back in the 80s, we believed in the information deficit model of social change, and that if we could only get the information to policymakers they would do the right thing,” says atmospheric scientist Ken Caldeira, senior scientist for Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy. “And now we see that really it’s not about information deficit, it’s about power relations, and people wanting to keep economic and political power. And so just telling people some more climate science isn’t going to help anything.” That’s not to say there’s no further need for atmospheric models, or a better understanding of various aspects of climate science. But what this report makes abundantly clear is that acting on climate is not being restricted by a lack of scientific knowledge or technological options, but by entrenched power structures and an absence of political will. To effectively address that, and act in time to avoid the worst impacts of warming, social scientists agree: we’re going to need more than climate models.

4/5/2022,"“I’m having my kitchen redone and am torn about whether to get a gas or induction hob. Help!”Hayley, Lancaster “I don’t know anyone who has converted to induction who wants to go back,” says food writer and broadcaster Tim Hayward. The benefits of not cooking on gas, he says, are myriad, but the first question to ask yourself, Hayley, is how much coverage you need: “For most of my life, I’ve had big stoves with five burners, and I’ve never used all of them at once,” Hayward explains. So he’s now gone for something smaller: a Sage Control Freak, which is a single induction burner that sits on top of the worktop and has two built-in probes to measure the temperature of both the pan and the food inside it. His wife also insisted on a built-in, single-pan induction hob, but it doesn’t get much use: “If she’d let me have two Control Freaks, we’d be absolutely fine.” Guardian columnist Thomasina Miers also prefers induction – well, most of the time. “It’s quick, efficient and you don’t get too hot while cooking, because it’s not throwing heat at you,” she says. “It’s also lower on energy, which everyone will now be needing.” On that point, Which? conducted a hob speed test last year, comparing the time it takes to boil a large pan of water: gas came in at 9.69 minutes and induction 4.81. But that’s not the only reason to consider induction. “There’s no point of ignition, so you don’t have to worry about things like frying pans catching fire,” Hayward says. Plus, it’s very controllable: “You can turn the power on or off, and expect a response in the pan within seconds.” The downside, of course, is that you might need to invest in a new set of pans (they need to have magnetic properties to conduct electricity). “Any pan you can stick a magnet to the bottom of [ie, cast-iron] will work on an induction cooker.” What didn’t work so well, however, were Hayward’s “beautiful and ancient” French copper crepe pans, so he also got himself a portable single gas burner: “I can now do crepe suzette on a trolley tableside.” Miers, meanwhile, mixed things up with four induction burners and three gas. “I hedged my bets, which not everyone is able to do, but there’s just something I love about [cooking on] fire: chargrilling aubergine and peppers, warming flatbread and for my wok, which I use a lot.” Asimakis Chaniotis, head chef at Michelin-starred Pied a Terre in Fitzrovia, agrees: “Fire is real cooking,” he says. “It’s where the magic happens. At home I have a big gas stove, but if you want a more efficient solution, go for induction.” That’s not to say you have to do away with fire altogether. If you’ve got some outdoor space, get a barbecue to char those summer veg and flatbreads. “There are loads of fun bread ovens you can use, or Big Green Egg-type things,” Miers says. “In terms of space, flexibility and cost of gas, having an outdoor cooking option is a very welcome alternative.” Got a culinary dilemma?

4/5/2022,"Last week, while watching an outdated DVD about “growing and changing” with my year 2 class, a child in the programme blew out their birthday candles and shared slices of the cake with their friends. Outrage in the classroom ensued. “Miss, was that before corona? That’s disgusting!” Birthday parties are a small part of what young children have missed over the past two years. Since the first lockdown began, children have missed months of classroom learning, play dates, drama groups and football practice. Recent findings from Ofsted show the pandemic has delayed the social skills of young children – with some unable to understand facial expressions as a result. These will surprise no teacher. There have been no national lockdowns or two-week “bubble” closures during this academic year, and this relative consistency has been wonderful. But being back at school has also given staff a clearer understanding of how the pandemic has affected children’s development. The recent reports from Amanda Spielman, Ofsted’s chief inspector, resonate with what I’ve seen among younger children at my school. The early years non-statutory curriculum is based on the principle that all areas of learning are connected. It places greater emphasis on communication and social and physical development than the curriculum of older year groups, where progress is defined in a more traditionally academic sense. So it’s unsurprising that children who have missed months of nursery and reception – school years that teach them how to play cooperatively with others and voice their needs or ideas – are now showing gaps in these foundational skills. In my school, some children are now struggling to articulate what they need or want, answer simple questions or follow short instructions. This has a knock-on effect on their social skills. Those who haven’t had much practice taking turns in conversation or sharing with others find playing and using school resources difficult. Many children have missed out on physical development opportunities; it has been eye-opening to witness four- and five-year-olds choosing to crawl down the corridor into the toilets rather than walk.My school emphasises a relational approach to education, which recognises that children learn best when they feel safe, secure and stable. I am seeing anxiety in the pupils I teach, which manifests in different ways – aches and pains, reluctance to enter the classroom in the mornings, unwillingness to try new things – all of which affect their ability to function in the classroom. Class teachers and teaching assistants are so important in promoting feelings of security in young children. Every time one of us is off sick with Covid-19, it has a knock-on effect on the children we teach. I often wonder whether abrupt school closures during the lockdowns of the past two years, which gave little time for school staff or families to emotionally prepare children for dramatic changes, have left a lasting impression on children’s sense that they can rely on school as a constant in their lives. It is really sad to think about those children who lack stability in their home lives, and what impact these sudden closures would have had on them. Teachers identified many of the issues raised in the recent Ofsted findings early during the pandemic. Educational specialists called for a “summer of play” in 2021, and Kevin Courtney of the NEU spoke about the need to give schools flexibility in organising the curriculum to support children’s emotional needs in 2020. So it seems misguided that the Department for Education has chosen to focus more on lost academic learning than the missed social, physical, communication and emotional development of children. Neither the National Tutoring Programme, the assessing of children through SATs after a two-year hiatus or the enforcement of minimum classroom hours will address these issues. Children are resilient by nature. Along with the anxiety and fear that have surrounded Covid-19, they have dealt with the pandemic with humour and creativity. It has been interesting to see how my students have portrayed the pandemic in their games, stories and drawings. Many have adjusted to living through a pandemic better than some of the adults I know. While this school year has been tiring for children (my year 2s have never had an uninterrupted period of education as long as this one), I can already see the powerful part that time and consistency will play in children’s development after lockdown. All school staff want the best for the children they serve, although their visions of what “the best” looks like will be different. I feel lucky that my school has not imposed some of the directives I’ve heard others have received, such as setting after-school “catch-up” sessions for children as young as six years old, or mock SATs for the first week back in September 2021. At the school where I teach, leaders have accepted that filling gaps in learning is a long-term, ongoing project that will require collaboration and communication between staff working across different age groups for years to come. Last academic year, working in year 1, I built more time into the school day for play and investigation, and allowed children opportunities to develop the social, physical, communication and emotional skills they had missed out on after a broken year of reception. Although we endured more lockdowns and class-bubble closures that year, I am now working with the same children in year 2 and believe the extra time dedicated to these fundamental learning skills and behaviours has had a long-term impact that I don’t think additional classroom hours or statutory assessments would have achieved. Perhaps one of the key lessons from the pandemic is that the government and primary schools should take more inspiration from the early years curriculum – with its emphasis on communication, and social and physical learning – and value these fundamental areas of development alongside academic attainment.

4/5/2022,"A rally in Berlin that was organised to draw attention to growing hostility towards Russians in Germany but included demonstrators supportive of the invasion of Ukraine has drawn sharp criticism from politicians and diplomats. About 900 protesters in a 400-strong motorcade took part in the demonstration on Sunday that culminated in a gathering at the Olympic Stadium. Cars were draped in the Russian flag, and one bore the symbol “Z”, meant to signify solidarity with the Russian war. Participants reportedly sang patriotic Russian songs. Christian Freier, a car mechanic identified as the organiser, displayed a Star of David on the front of his car above the slogan “Will we be next?”. He compared what he called the victimisation of Russians in Germany since the outbreak of the war with the persecution of Jews under the Nazis, and said participants were also angry at what he called propaganda about the invasion being spread in German schools. Ukraine’s ambassador to Germany, Andriy Melnyk, said he was appalled that the demonstration, which was apparently registered in advance with the police and had its protection, was allowed to go ahead, in particular on a day when atrocities against hundreds of civilians in the town of Bucha, north of Kyiv, were reported. “For heaven’s sake, how could they allow this motorcade of shame to take place in the middle of Berlin?” he tweeted, focusing his criticism mainly on Berlin’s mayor, Franziska Giffey, and the police. Giffey responded: “I understand the anger and condemn any utterance that plays down the Russian war of aggression.” Berlin’s senate has expressed concern over upcoming sensitive anniversaries, such as the end of the second world war on 8-9 May, which they believe Russian nationalists may try to exploit. Torsten Akmann, the state secretary for Berlin’s interior ministry, said no demonstrations for those dates had yet been registered with the police and “we are keeping a very close eye on things”. Freier, who has lived in Germany since 2001 having moved from Russia, said his main aim had been to draw attention to the growing hostility being shown towards Russians or people of Russian origin in Berlin. He told the newspaper Bild he had been surprised by the large turnout. “I had expected about 30 cars to show up,” he said. “I am still in shock that so many came.” He said he was “100% against the war, as is everyone I am demonstrating with,” but said many Germans did not understand the anger among many Russians. He said it had been a mistake to put a Star of David on his car, which the police had made him remove. At least one demonstrator was removed from the protest for displaying the pro-invasion “Z” symbol, which has been forbidden from public places in three German states including Berlin. A counter-demonstration that aimed to block the motorcade was prevented by police from doing so as it had not been registered with the authorities. Participants in that now face public nuisance proceedings. Herbert Reul, the interior minister for the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, said he was appalled by the demonstration and the fact it was allowed to go ahead with police protection. “In view of the atrocities and the pictures of the past few days, it is personally beyond me to see how someone can embrace war criminals in this way,” he said. Germany’s federal minister for justice, Marco Buschmann, said open endorsement of the Russian war was a criminal offence, and his FDP colleague Stephan Thomae called the rally “macabre and tasteless” and said there was a case for examining whether participants could be prosecuted.",News/World news,‘Motorcade of shame’: outrage over pro-Russia displays at Berlin rally,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/motorcade-of-shame-outrage-over-pro-russia-displays-at-berlin-rally
4/5/2022,"Sixty countries will meet in Geneva from Wednesday to discuss curbs on the use of heavy bombs in urban areas in the wake of intense fighting in Ukraine that is believed to have killed and injured thousands in cities such as Mariupol. The three-day conference, supported by the UN secretary general, aims to produce a draft international agreement to restrict the use of indiscriminate bombing in cities, which statistics show overwhelmingly leads to the death of civilians. Analysis published on Tuesday shows that when bombs went off in cities during 2021, 89% of the people killed or injured were civilians – described as a “predictable harm” by one of the report’s authors, Iain Overton, from the charity Action on Armed Violence (AOAV). The global figures do not include the conflict in Ukraine, but the pattern is expected to be similar for 2022. Initial figures recorded by AOAV in Ukraine have counted 1,411 civilian casualties, which is almost certainly an underestimate, 96% of which took place in urban areas. Russian forces have sought to capture the southern port city of Mariupol using heavy shelling, with a theatre sheltering civilians and a maternity hospital struck during the past month. Ukraine has estimated that 5,000 civilians have been killed in the city, but this is not possible to verify. Laura Boillot, the coordinator of the International Network on Explosive Weapons, a pressure group, said: “When explosive weapons with wide area effects are used in populated areas among civilians and infrastructure, it is civilians that suffer the most. “We’ve seen extensive use of heavy explosive weapon systems such as unguided missiles and multi-barrel rocket launchers in major towns and cities in Ukraine such as Kyiv and Mariupol. These weapons impact a wide area with blast and fragmentation, and are prone to inaccuracy.” Those watching this week’s talks hope the fighting in Ukraine will give impetus to those involved to agree a draft text to curb bombing in built-up areas by a core group of countries. The wording will then be finalised at a meeting in May or June to produce an agreement that states can then sign up to. Last week a spokesperson for António Guterres, the UN secretary general, called for countries to agree “a strong text that includes an express commitment to avoid the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas”. But it is not yet clear what language will be agreed, or who will be prepared to sign up to the draft agreement, which has so far been coordinated by Ireland. European countries led by France and Belgium have been among the keenest to reach an agreement, with others such as the UK engaged on the issue. However, the US has expressed some reservations and is not certain to sign up. Russia has been monitoring previous discussions but is not expected to endorse the agreement. At present the key part of the draft text calls for “restricting the use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas” – beyond the area of an immediate military objective. It is already illegal under international humanitarian law to target civilians in war. But it is hoped that further curbs on the use of heavy munitions in built-up areas will act as a reference point in future conflicts, as does a ban on cluster munitions. Overall, the AOAV research recorded 19,473 deaths and injuries by explosive weapons in 2,489 incidents recorded in English-language media in 2021, up 1% from the year before. Of these, 57% were civilians. The worst affected countries and territories in 2021 were Afghanistan, Syria, Gaza, Yemen and Iraq.",News/World news,Ukraine war looms over conference on curbing use of heavy bombs in cities,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/sixty-countries-discuss-curbs-heavy-bombing-urban-areas
4/5/2022,"When Selman Turk married Nurhüda Cevahir at a lavish ceremony in a mansion overlooking the Bosphorus, a former Turkish deputy prime minister described the event as “the wedding of the two most distinguished families of Istanbul”. Turk, now the subject of legal proceedings in London accusing him of embezzling almost £40m, was then working for Goldman Sachs, and the wedding at the Sait Halim Pasha Mansion reflected the families’ elite status. The mansion boasts golden columns, glitzy chandeliers and a view directly on to the water, a fitting venue for a bride believed to be the daughter of founders of a prominent Turkish construction firm. Witnesses for the couple included then-deputy prime minister Bülent Arınç, former president of Goldman Sachs Turkey, Çağlayan Çetin, and business magnate Akın İpek according to at least one Turkish tabloid. The local press chafed at Arınç’s statements on the wedding day, where he complained that people banged pots and pans outside the venue as part of anti-government protests. “Who has the right to make them unhappy on their wedding night, friends?,” Arınç asked, irritated that demonstrators disturbed the glamorous event long into the night. Yet almost a decade later, Turk’s status has fallen dramatically from his high as a newly minted member of the Turkish elite. He lives in exile in London, part of an exodus of accused members and associates of the Gülen movement, which the Turkish authorities accuse of masterminding an attempted coup in 2016. Legal proceedings initiated by Nebahat Evyap İşbilen, the wife of a former top official from Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP), claim that Turk “dishonestly misappropriated some $50 million in breach of fiduciary duty and by means of undue influence”, while funnelling payments of £750,000 to Prince Andrew in order to procure İşbilen a passport. The prince claims he repaid the money 16 months after receiving it, and has declined to comment further. “Mrs İşbilen is the victim of serious fraud and financial wrongdoing carried out at the hands of Selman Turk, a man she trusted to help her through extremely difficult circumstances,” said İşbilen’s lawyer, Jonathan Tickner. İşbilen is a former board member of the Evyap Group, a major Turkish soap and personal care company, who claims she tasked Turk with helping her move assets out of Turkey after she went into exile after her husband’s arrest in 2016. Işbilen and Turk were longtime associates: court proceedings state that the two families had known each other for over 30 years. “Mr İşbilen, the claimant’s husband, attended Mr Türk’s wedding in 2013,” it adds. Turk’s connections to the Gülen movement have led some in the media in Turkey to label him as a “banker for FËTO”, using a term coined by Turkish authorities to associate the movement with terrorism. For other observers, Turk’s fall from grace represents both the flight of Gülenist money from Turkey but also the shifting status of a network of elites that a decade ago were closely intertwined with the ruling AKP. Gülenists are followers of conservative Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen, who has lived in exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, and whose movement allied with Erdoğan’s AKP during its early days in government. Turk and Cevahir’s wedding occurred during the movement’s last remaining glory days in Turkey, shortly before the government banned it and enacted a sweeping crackdown on alleged Gülenists across all walks of public life after the 2016 coup attempt where at least 77,000 people were arrested. In his defence filings, Turk says that he “was not a member of the Gülen movement and did not want to be associated with it despite his family’s close links to Mr Gülen”, but that these same familial ties motivated Işbilen to choose him to help with her finances. “Mr Turk’s grandfather was Mr Gülen’s friend and Mr Turk’s uncle is Mr Gülen’s first student but was not involved in the management of the FËTO movement or any strategic decisions of the movement,” it says. Turk added that he remembered when Işbilen approached him in early 2017 because he was visiting the United States for Donald Trump’s inauguration. “We know there was a Gülenist network of capital whose flight from Turkey to London was facilitated by a wider professional network. Selman Turk seems to be a figure in that conversation,” said Selim Sazak, of Ankara-based consultancy firm TUM Strategy. “He wasn’t a nobody, clearly, he had a professional pedigree, but he wasn’t someone you’d immediately think of as a facilitator for that flight. He’s a second-rung person in the concentric circles of politicians and professionals who made this exodus possible, as some of these people ultimately settled in London. There were very few people who would come out clean had there been a broader societal reckoning with the legacy of the Gülen movement,” said Sazak. After leaving Goldman Sachs in early 2016, Turk’s activities in Britain shifted. He founded a broad network of businesses and limited liability companies across the world, including SG Financial Group, named in court filings as one of the network of companies that prosecutors say he used to hide funds from İşbilen. SG Financial Group was just one of a vast and shifting swath of businesses registered in Florida, Georgia and tax havens such as Dubai, the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands, including financial management companies, IT companies and a trading company. Turk left SG Financial group in 2020, and claims that he used the companies to move money from Işbilen consensually, within accepted corporate practices, and in a way he would have been “unable,” to do in a personal capacity. Turk also founded Naturlich dairy products, a US company that claimed to produce yoghurt and artisanal cheeses by “preserving the Amish milk tradition.” An investigation by the Turkish Anadolu news agency claimed that the business was tied to Gülen’s personal chef, and operated from a farm adjacent to his Pennsylvania compound. In 2019, Turk founded Heyman AI, the company which reportedly won a People’s Choice Award from Prince Andrew at the Pitch@Palace event. Heyman AI appears unpopular with some former employees: Two successfully sued the company for unpaid wages of sums about £5,000, while reviews on the employment website Glassdoor complain that contractors and employees went unpaid. The company was liquidated in September last year. Turk did not respond to a request for comment. He denies the accusations against him from Işbilen in his defense in court documents, arguing that she asked him to help her transfer her assets out of Turkey “and putting them beyond reach of the Turkish authorities,” and that he did exactly as she asked. “He did not engage in any deceit,” it adds.",News/UK news,Selman Turk: the exiled businessman who gave Prince Andrew money,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/05/selman-turk-exiled-businessman-prince-andrew
4/5/2022,"Suspected Russian mercenaries participated in an operation with Mali’s army in March in which about 300 civilian men were allegedly executed over five days, Human Rights Watch (HRW) says. Eyewitnesses and local community leaders said hundreds of men were rounded up and killed in small groups during the anti-jihadist operation on 23 March in the central town of Moura. The rural town of about 10,000 inhabitants is in the Mopti region, a hotspot of jihadist activity that has intensified and spread to neighbouring countries in the Sahel region. Local security sources told HRW that more than 100 Russian-speaking men were allegedly involved in the operation, which HRW described as the worst single atrocity reported in Mali’s decade-long armed conflict. Witnesses spoke of white soldiers talking in an unfamiliar foreign language they believed to be Russian. Mali’s army has long been accused of rights abuses during counter-insurgency operations. A Mali military spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request by Reuters for comment on the HRW report. “Abuses by armed Islamist groups is no justification at all for the military’s deliberate slaughter of people in custody,” said Corinne Dufka, Sahel director at Human Rights Watch. “The Malian government is responsible for this atrocity, the worst in Mali in a decade, whether carried about by Malian forces or associated foreign soldiers.” After the reports of alleged atrocities in Moura, Mali’s army said last week that from 23-31 March it killed 203 Islamist militants and detained a further 51 following intelligence reports about a meeting between rebel groups. It added that it would investigate any allegations of rights abuses. Horrific accounts of alleged abuses by Malian forces and suspected Russian mercenaries have emerged from the town. On 27 March, witnesses said that Malian soldiers arrived by helicopter near Moura’s animal market and exchanged gunfire with jihadists. Helicopters blocked exits from the area as traders and civilians tried to escape. The witnesses said soldiers patrolled the town, executing several unarmed men trying to flee and detaining hundreds more. The witnesses said groups of up to 10 men at a time, most from the pastoralist Fulani (also known as Peuhl) ethnic group, were killed. One trader said he was drinking tea with his two brothers while waiting for the market to start when he heard shooting. “Seven Russians approached, gesturing for us to get up. There were no Malian soldiers with them. They searched us and the house, then took us east of the village, near the river, where we found another 100 men,” he told HRW. “Another group of Russians pointed at my brothers and another man. I thought they were going for interrogation. They took them several metres away and executed them, point blank.” Mali, an impoverished country of nearly 21 million people, is governed by a junta that seized power in a coup in August 2020, promising to restore civilian rule. The country is under sanctions from the west Africa bloc Ecowas for ignoring an earlier commitment to hold elections in February this year. Swathes of Mali lie outside government control, owing to a brutal jihadist conflict that started in 2012 and has spread to neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger. Germany’s foreign ministry urged Mali to hold an independent investigation into the reports of civilian deaths. “Mali’s general staff mentioned no civilian victims in its report of the operation,” the German Foreign Office said. “That is contradicted by possible witness statements that mention targeted killing of civilians.” There has been a sharp rise in killings of civilians and terror suspects in Mali since late December, both by jihadist groups linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State, and by Malian security forces. HRW said at least 107 civilians have been killed, and that 71 of the deaths could be linked to Malian-aligned forces. Mali’s military leadership has forged closer links with Russia after its relations soured with the west – in particular with France, its former ally and colonial-era ruler, which has committed to scaling down its forces in the Sahel. The Malian government is battling the insurgency with the help of private military contractors from Russia’s Wagner group. Mali and Russia have previously said they are not mercenaries but trainers helping local troops with equipment bought from Russia. Wagner, established in 2014 to support pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, is allegedly funded by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a powerful businessman closely linked to Vladimir Putin who has faced western sanctions. Prigozhin and Moscow have denied any knowledge of Wagner and, officially, private military companies are illegal in Russia.

4/5/2022,"The total wealth of the world’s billionaires has dipped from a record high last year amid a drop in global stock markets since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, despite the planet’s richest people still holding a combined $12.7tn (£9.7tn) in assets. According to the annual Forbes magazine ranking of the world richest people, the number of billionaires worldwide fell by 329 to 2,668, with the total value of their combined assets falling slightly from $13.1tn on the 2021 list. It said that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine – and the avalanche of sanctions that followed – sent the Russian stock market and the rouble plummeting, resulting in 34 fewer Russian billionaires on the list. Those from the country with billionaire status almost all saw their fortunes stagnate or decline, with their total wealth dropping by more than $260bn compared with a year earlier. Forbes said the decline in the total number of billionaires from 2,755 to 2,668 was the largest since the 2009 financial crisis, but followed an increase of more than 600 in 2021 when global stock bounced back from pandemic lows. Elon Musk, the maverick boss of Tesla and SpaceX, was named the world’s richest man for the first time with a $219bn fortune, up $68bn on the previous year because of the carmaker’s soaring share price. Musk leapfrogged Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, whose fortune dropped to $171bn after a small decline in the company’s share price and donations to charity. Bezos’s estimated $1.5bn charitable gifts pale in comparison with his ex-wife MacKenzie Scott, who has given away $12.5bn to more than 1,250 organisations in less than two years. Scott, who collected a $38bn settlement in her divorce from Bezos in 2019, has fallen from the 22nd-richest person on the planet to the 30th with a $43.6bn fortune. Among those falling out of the ranking are 169 “one-year wonders” – newcomers to the list in 2021 but who have already dropped off. They include the exercise bike company Peloton’s John Foley and the dating app Bumble’s Whitney Wolfe Herd. Some 236 people joined the billionaire club for the first time, including the pop star Rihanna, the Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson and the venture capitalist Joshua Kushner. Barbados, Bulgaria, Estonia and Uruguay gained their first billionaires. Millionaires for Humanity, a coalition of rich people calling for a global wealth tax on the super-rich to tackle inequality, said the Forbes list was “a slap in the face of society”. Djaffar Shalchi, a Danish multimillionaire businessman and founder of the initiative, said: “The Forbes rich list is a stark reminder of the obscenely unequal world in which we live. While most people around the globe have struggled to adapt and survive to the pandemic, many having lost their jobs, plunged deeper into poverty, those on the Forbes rich list have been able to sit back and watch their wealth soar.” “It is an affront to humanity, an insult to the claim that we are all in this together, and a slap in the face to those of us who believe that we share this planet and its resources equally. “The time for a wealth tax on people like me is long overdue. Inequality is bad for everyone. Even in the US we are looking at the prospect of President Biden introducing a billionaire tax. This would be an important step in the right direction.”",News/Business,"Total wealth of world’s billionaires has fallen to $12.7tn, says Forbes",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/05/wealth-worlds-billionaires-forbes-elon-musk-jeff-bezos
4/5/2022,"Steve McClaren is under consideration for a return to Old Trafford as Erik ten Hag’s No 2 should the Dutchman be appointed as Manchester United’s next permanent manager. Ten Hag held talks with United last month. As the Ajax manager has never worked in the Premier League, the ideal candidate to be his assistant would have experience in the competition. McClaren worked in the role between 1999 and 2001 under Sir Alex Ferguson, with the club claiming the treble at the end of his first season there. Should the appointments happen, it would mark a role reversal for the pair. The vastly experienced McClaren had Ten Hag as his assistant for the 2008-9 season when in charge of Twente. The 60-year-old took the Dutch club to second before claiming Twente’s inaugural league championship the following year. McClaren, who managed England for 18 games in 16 months from 2006-2007, won the League Cup with Middlesbrough in 2004, and has been in charge of Wolfsburg, Nottingham Forest, Derby County twice and Newcastle United. His last managerial position at Queens Park Rangers came to an end three years ago, when he was sacked with the club 17th in the Championship. Although United are still considering other candidates including Paris Saint-Germain’s Mauricio Pochettino, it is understood that 52-year-old Ten Hag has particularly impressed the club regarding taking over from Ralf Rangnick, the interim manager, in the close season. The first match for whoever is appointed will be the friendly against Liverpool in Bangkok on 12 July. While the ticket prices range from around £115 to £455 and the latter cost is more than for this season’s Champions League final both clubs receive only a fixed fee to participate.

4/5/2022,"The use of pop songs to sell everything from airlines to chewing gum has become commonplace, but converting a character from a TV commercial into a chart-topping star is a different story. This was the feat accomplished by Bill Fries Jr, who has died aged 93 of cancer. Fries created the character of CW McCall for the Bozell & Jacobs advertising agency in Omaha, Nebraska, to promote the Metz Baking Company’s Old Home Bread. McCall’s particular achievement was his chart-topping single Convoy (1975), a tall tale about an armada of trucks romping across the US in defiance of swarms of cops and the National Guard. In the TV commercials, which won Fries a Clio award in 1974, the Texan actor Jim Finlayson played a truck driver named CW McCall, who was frequently to be found in the Old Home Filler-Up an’ Keep On-a-Truckin’ Cafe. He announced himself as “CW McCall, and I haul for Old Home. You can call me CW.” For the accompanying musical jingles, Fries (pronounced “freeze”) wrote the lyrics and Chip Davis composed the music. Davis also founded the group Mannheim Steamroller, celebrated for its Christmas albums mixing classical, new age and rock idioms. The ads became so popular that viewers began calling TV stations to ask when they would be on the air, prompting Fries to launch McCall as an artist in his own right, stepping into the role himself. His first single was, aptly enough, Old Home Filler-Up an’ Keep On-a-Truckin’ Cafe, which reached No 19 on the US country chart and 54 on the mainstream chart. Wolf Creek Pass, a comical account of a nightmare truck journey through the Colorado mountains, reached 12 (country) and 40 (mainstream), followed by Classified and Black Bear Road. It was clear that Fries had a gift for waspishly witty and shrewdly observed lyrics, which he narrated in a gravelly, laid-back baritone. The slickly arranged musical accompaniments mixed bluegrass banjo, strings and jogging country rhythms with a chorus of female backing singers to add a touch of commercial fairy-dust. The McCall phenomenon reached its apogee with Convoy, an international hit that topped the US country and mainstream charts and reached No 2 in the UK. Framed as a conversation between two truck drivers called Pig Pen and Rubber Duck, its CB radio jargon like “bear in the air” (a police helicopter), Shaky Town (Los Angeles) and “10-4” (meaning “affirmative”) vividly evoked the highway-driving life of American truckers. It struck a resonant chord at a time when a Middle East oil crisis meant higher fuel costs and an unpopular 55mph speed limit. “It was laced with humour, but it had a rebellious feeling about it and people responded to it,” Fries commented in 1990. The song’s parent album, Black Bear Road, topped the country chart and was a Top 20 hit on the album chart. Recently, Fries was delighted to approve the use of Convoy by the so-called “Freedom Convoy” of truckers who drove across Canada to protest against Covid-19 vaccine requirements. Convoy caught the public imagination powerfully enough to sell 7m copies, and was the inspiration for Sam Peckinpah’s 1978 film of the same name, which starred Kris Kristofferson and Ali MacGraw. “We had to write new lyrics to the original song to fit the movie script,” said Fries, but added ruefully that “Smokey and the Bandit came out before that [in 1977, starring Burt Reynolds and Sally Field] and got all the attention as far as the CB radio thing.” He did not scale such commercial heights again, but achieved further chart success with the albums Wilderness, Rubber Duck and Roses for Mama. His 1976 single There Won’t Be No Country Music (There Won’t Be No Rock’n’Roll) was a premonition of environmental disaster, with imagery of strip-mining and landfill garbage dumps and the warning that “when they take away our country / They’ll take away our soul”. McCall’s single Roses for Mama (1977) found him turning his hand to syrupy, sentimental balladry, but he did it well enough to score a No 2 hit on the US country chart. He was born Billie Dale Fries in Audubon, Iowa, though later changed his name to William Dale Fries Jr. He inherited an enthusiasm for music from both his parents, Margaret and Billie, a foreman at a factory making farm buildings, and at one stage aimed to become a classical musician. He studied music at the University of Iowa and played the clarinet in the concert band, but majored in fine arts, leaving after his first year. Then he moved to Omaha and worked as a designer at a TV station, before joining Bozell & Jacobs in 1961. He would go on to become the agency’s vice-president and creative director. At the end of the 1970s he discarded his McCall persona and moved to the small town of Ouray, Colorado, where he became involved in environmental causes. The town was located amid steep slopes at 7,700 ft, earning it the sobriquet “the Switzerland of America”. Fries served as the town’s mayor from 1986 to 1992. In 1952 he married Rena Bonnema, and she survives him, along with their children Bill, Mark and Nancy.

4/5/2022,"It is fitting that an adaptation of Floella Benjamin’s memoir of her girlhood should encapsulate the spirit of children’s television. After all, it was Play School that made Benjamin a household name in the 1980s. This musical weaves misty-eyed flashbacks to that series – iconic lines, collective singing and clap-alongs – with a story of Britain’s Windrush-era racism from a child’s perspective. But there is a great chunk of story that feels missing, for adults, at least. Adapted by David Wood and directed by Omar F Okai, the play circles around the early years but we never learn how Benjamin rose, so singularly, to become the face of children’s TV in an era of open racial hostility and little diversity on screen. It is all the more disappointing because the show begins and ends in adulthood when Floella (Paula Kay), now Lady Benjamin of Beckenham, is awarded the Freedom of the City of London honour in 2018. This framing promises that the dots will be joined, but the story does not take in the full arc of Benjamin’s journey. We are simply told that she appeared on Play School for “12 happy years”, not how she got there or the hurdles she overcame. Instead, the play revolves around early girlhood, first living with five siblings in Trinidad and then 15 months in foster care while her parents, Marmie (Bree Smith) and Dardie (Kojo Kamara) travelled to London to set up home for their children. Benjamin is raised on postwar mythologies of the mother country’s greatness, so she is shocked by the abject daily racism when she arrives in London aged 10. It is interesting to see Windrush-era experience from a child’s point of view, both in the “brainwashed” education Benjamin receives in Trinidad (British history is taught with no mention of slavery) and her alienation in England, not least her shock when she is told the family must live in one room. But this moment, along with others, feels brisk and undetailed, not nearly as powerful as the shock Hortense feels in a similar instance in the National Theatre’s revival of Small Island. The drama lacks emotional depth and texture as a whole; Benjamin is told to go back home and often sees signs in windows stating: “No dogs, no Irish, no coloureds” but none of these moments are developed or feel specific enough, though they will doubtless educate a younger audience. There is a lovely calypso vibe to some of the music and the cast have able singing voices but the choreography looks rudimentary and unremarkable. The songs are performed well enough but come to feel sleepy in energy, the actors often static as they sing, and they seem to be padding out the limited story; by the end of over two hours, Benjamin is still only at school, elaborating on school dinners, and the drama feels like it is dragging its feet. Bretta Gerecke’s set design feels oddly empty too. A skeletal structure representing the family house in Trinidad is wheeled on and off stage. A back screen has swirls of changing colour which does not add to the story in a meaningful way and indistinct shapes hang in a mystifying mobile overhead: they could be rocks, molten clouds or pieces of coal. Adult actors play Floella’s five young siblings and while Kay, as Floella, gives a winning performance, the others seem jarring and contrived in their parts, dressed in long shorts and frocks. There is a transforming moment when Benjamin turns away from anger and embraces positivity in response to race hate, but this comes in a heavily message-bound ending. There are occasional invitations for audience participation – we sing “If you’re happy and you know it” and we stamp our feet.

4/5/2022,"Another day, another tranche of Partygate fines from the police. You’ll have heard the adage that politics is showbiz for ugly people. So let’s be real: the Conservative party’s reaction to lawbreaking in Downing Street is the Oscars slap for ugly people. Think back to what we saw on our TVs. A whole class of pretentious narcissists, so terminally in hock to a corrupt system of golden job offers and preferment that any moral code could only ever take a distant second place to the impulse to worshipfully close ranks. And Hollywood’s no better. Every day, ministers who go on the airwaves to defend Boris Johnson over Partygate are doing the equivalent of the standing ovation in the Dolby theatre – a community of hilariously absurd people rising to their feet and applauding someone they know full well has behaved appallingly, because … because what? Because some things are more important? Bollocks. They’re applauding because they’re totally ridiculous and vain people. Those who felt slapped in the face when the multiple party stories first emerged just have to suck it up. We’re all Chris Rock now. I’m only waiting for religious wingnut Jacob Rees-Mogg to claim that the devil comes for prime ministers when they’re at their highest. Yesterday, it emerged that the government’s former ethics chief has been fined for attending a lawbreaking karaoke party at which there was apparently a drunken brawl. You laugh, but she’ll probably get a Grammy for talking about it next year. With each endlessly pious lecture that we should “move on”, ministers cleave closer to the characteristics of the remote Hollywood entertainment elite who are forever chiding the little people to look away from their foibles. This trend has been visible for a while. It’s not just things like Boris Johnson taking a private jet from his own climate conference – has anything more preposterously Tinseltown ever happened? – but the constant expectation that politicians should be allowed to “grow” despite holding positions of huge power and responsibility. Cut them some slack – they are works in progress! In fact, it feels more like they are trying to eliminate the very idea of disgrace. The overall impression is that we are governed by people to whom the usual rules do not apply, because they are special. Like celebrities. They are an elite community, unmoored from the constraints by which normal people are bound. Even their outside-politics behaviour appears to be becoming more celeb-y. With increasing regularity, one or other MP issues a non-apology apology, or some mad health advice, or a statement responding to accusations of reprehensible behaviour in a self-pityingly modern fashion. On Sunday, a Conservative MP called David Warburton was accused of sexual assault and pictured allegedly posing next to some cocaine (he has denied any wrongdoing). On Monday, it was announced that he had checked into a psychiatric hospital suffering from “severe shock and stress”. I see. I know I have to say I’m sorry he’s in a state and everything, but this is a man accused of multiple incidents of sexual misconduct. I can’t help but remember that Harvey Weinstein’s reaction to a number of accusations was to seclude himself in some kind of Arizona head-spa. As Harvey put it to reporters shortly before being admitted: “You know what, we all make mistakes … Second chance, I hope.” Weinstein was of course suffering from the severe shock and stress of being found out. I say “found out”, but it turns out that Conservative whips were informed of some of the women’s allegations against Mr Warburton two weeks ago, but did not take action against him – a modus operandi which will be familiar to those who know how hard Hollywood works to protect its menfolk. I wonder which politician will be next to check into the equivalent of somewhere called Pathways or Meadowlands, following an incident or incidents that to ordinary people simply looks like rotten behaviour, and not something that can be conveniently clinicalised because you’re in a hole? I wouldn’t give it long before some MP reacts to being caught bang-to-rights by entering a clinic for sex addiction, at which point it’ll be mandatory to salute him and say we hope he finds the space to work on himself. (As Chazz Michael Michaels observes in Blades of Glory, it’s a real disease, with doctors and medicine and everything.) The era of a disgraced politician looking contritely over their garden gate while their wife wears a rictus is ever more passé. Still, there’s such a fine line, isn’t there, between progress and evading responsibility. Consider the parliamentary rise of another Hollywood favourite: aggressive lawsuits. Only in the past fortnight, long after he was handed a jail sentence for sex offences against two women, did the former Tory MP Charlie Elphicke finally drop his four-year libel claim against the Sunday Times over the story that a woman had told the Tory whips and police that he had raped her but investigators had taken no action. And yet, for all their showbiz tricks, it still feels truly mad that ministers are out there defending lawbreaking BY THE PEOPLE THAT MADE THE LAWS. Not just any laws – the most draconian restrictions on freedom in peacetime, which saw people unable to be with their loved ones as they died horrible deaths alone, and all the other horrendous things a whole lot of British citizens have not “moved on” from, whatever their progressive overlords might wish. Every elite hypocrisy or plea for special treatment suggests these politicians are becoming more and more detached from those they are supposed to represent, most of whom have moved on to a cost of living crisis in which “personal growth” has become an unaffordable luxury. After his calamitous spring statement, it feels completely apt that chancellor Rishi Sunak should be spending his Easter holiday in Santa Monica. Hopefully he’ll go the whole hog and spend new year in Aspen with Barry Diller. As for how these various pretensions will go down with the electorate, I imagine quite badly, in the circumstances. Nobody goes to the movies to watch stuff like this. Are ordinary people allowed to go to a clinic for having to choose between heating and eating? Can they justify lawbreaking on the basis that laws are, as Rees-Mogg whined on behalf of the prime minister, “unkind and inhuman”? No. Or to put it another way, this high-status behaviour by a governing party is increasingly unrelatable. That’s a problem. People don’t accept being told what to do by hypocritical Hollywood stars. And unless politicians realise without exception that they are subject to the same rules, people eventually won’t accept being told what to do by them either.

4/5/2022,"Labour has renewed its calls for the UK to throw out the Russian ambassador in response to alleged war crimes committed in Ukraine, as Italy, Germany and France carried out a wave of diplomatic expulsions. David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, said there should be no place for Andrei Kelin in the UK after the latest reports of atrocities by Russian troops in Bucha, a suburb of Kyiv. Italy said on Tuesday it was expelling 30 Russian diplomats, after Germany kicked out 40 and France 35 in a wave of action. However, Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, has not yet taken action against Russian diplomats, and the government failed to bring forward planned legislation over the last year to make it easier to expel unregistered foreign agents. It has been argued by government sources that the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats over the novichok poisonings in Salisbury in 2018 has left few intelligence officers to take action against. But Lammy said the ambassador himself should be kicked out. “The sickening actions committed by Vladimir Putin and his cronies in Ukraine undoubtedly amount to war crimes,” Lammy said. “There should be no place for Russia’s ambassador to parrot the regime’s lies or intelligence agents to continue their hostile activity in the UK. Alongside expelling Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council, we should set up a special tribunal to personally prosecute Putin and his gangster regime.” Truss has called Kelin in to the Foreign Office twice in response to the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. However, the Foreign Office has resisted calls for expulsions. Some MPs believe the UK may be obtaining high-quality intelligence from Russian diplomatic sources, leading to the reluctance to take action against them as a group. On Monday a western official said: “A number of European partners have expelled Russian diplomats, principally intelligence officers. Because of all the action we took after Salisbury, we actually don’t have very many of that category of Russian in the embassy in London at the moment. So, while we keep it under review, we have no plans at the moment.”",News/Politics,Labour calls for Russian ambassador to be expelled over alleged war crimes,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/05/labour-calls-for-russian-ambassador-to-be-expelled-over-alleged-war-crimes
4/5/2022,"A trustee of a group that campaigns against onshore renewable energy has been put in charge of a county council’s “green masterplan”, the Guardian can reveal. Colin Davie, who is the executive councillor for economic development, environment and planning at Lincolnshire county council, is also one of three trustees of the Renewable Energy Foundation (REF). He has recently vowed to “restart old fights” and oppose new onshore wind. The REF, once chaired by the TV presenter Noel Edmonds, has for years argued against onshore wind, receiving much coverage in the rightwing press. It was founded in 2004 to fight against what it described as the “grotesque political push” for wind energy in the UK. They secured victories during previous Conservative governments, culminating when David Cameron banned onshore wind subsidies in 2016. Now it appears its members are readying for a fierce fight as new onshore renewables become a possibility again. In Lincolnshire the “green masterplan” drafted by Davie has been criticised as “unimaginative”, as it keeps the 2050 carbon neutral goal but contains minimal measures such as switching to LED streetlights and reducing paper use. There are no mentions of large-scale renewable energy. The prospect of new large-scale onshore renewables has been raised due to the energy crisis, with the government looking at allowing schemes as part of its imminent energy plan. The Guardian understands that local approval would probably be needed before any onshore scheme is greenlit. In Lincolnshire the people deciding on whether a scheme would have “local approval” include Davie. Last week, Davie was invited on Radio 4 Today programme to give his views on windfarms. He vowed onshore wind would not come to Lincolnshire, saying: “Onshore wind is not the answer.” He added: “We will not be changing our view on that, we have a resolution of the council and that I suspect is not going to be changed by anything the government might want to do. We need a new balanced energy policy that takes into account the intermittence of renewables.” Two trustees of the REF, Michael Kelly and John Constable, in February wrote to the Financial Times to complain about Tory MPs who were calling for more floating wind power. The REF says it is impartial and relies on “superb data” for its views on wind and solar farms. But it has strong links to a group accused of climate science scepticism, the Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF), started by Nigel Lawson. Members of the GWPF, including Lawson, have denied that global heating is a problem. Kelly has a position on the board of the GWPF. Constable has been quoted as a REF spokesperson and was previously its director of policy and research. Constable answered the Guardian’s questions for this article on behalf of the REF. Alethea Warrington, a campaigner at the climate charity Possible, said: “Homegrown onshore wind is our cheapest energy source, clean, and could be built tomorrow. Dragging heels now means only one thing – more reliance on dirty, volatile fossil fuels and unpalatable regimes. With eight in 10 people supporting it, it’s past time the government ended its onshore wind ban to allow communities to benefit from low-cost, secure and reliable energy.” Residents have raised their concerns about the lack of ambition in Lincolnshire’s climate plans – and the fact it was drafted by someone who opposes onshore renewable energy. Anna Marie Roos, a professor of the history of science and medicine at the University of Lincoln, has written to the local MP Victoria Atkins and lodged a complaint with the council. Roos said: “Tellingly, there is no mention of any plans to promote large-scale renewable energy [in the green masterplan], such as through offshore windfarms, or large solar arrays. The Lincolnite article reveals that Mr Davie is actively against windfarms, a stance that the REF promotes. This does not seem to be an impartial exercise of his responsibilities in the interests of local community or the avoidance of a conflict of interest, particularly when that interest is not clear due to the misleading nature of the name of the REF for whom Mr Davie is a trustee.” Davie told the Guardian he was “proud” of his role at the charity, which he noted was a registered interest, and added that he had been supportive of offshore wind locally. He said: “All forms of renewables, however, suffer from significant technical defects making them inherently expensive as a means of reducing emissions. They also have significant local environmental downsides. It is not easy to hide 150-metre high turbines in the flat, open and big sky landscapes which drive our visitors’ and residents’ love for Lincolnshire. All developments should be assessed on a case by case basis and the community should have maintained their right to say no to a development that affects them. “Lincolnshire is well on course with its carbon reduction agenda and with our wider leadership role on this issue. However, this is our place, we should be allowed to determine how we meet our goals and the wider ambitions of government without forcing communities to take things they do not want.” Constable, on behalf of the REF, said the group had no direct relationship with Lincolnshire county council. He said the REF’s policies were evidence-based and they had no blanket policy on renewables, adding: “The emissions abatement cost of renewables generally, and wind and solar in particular, is very high. This is especially true when system management costs are taken into account. Indeed, these renewables abatement costs exceed by a large margin the central estimates of the social cost of carbon, indicating that the harm to human welfare from achieving abatement via renewables exceeds that of climate change, which would be irrational. This suggests that the role of large-scale renewable schemes in any net zero delivery plan will be limited.”",News/Environment,Anti-onshore wind campaigner put in charge of council’s ‘green masterplan’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/05/anti-onshore-wind-campaigner-colin-davie-lincolnshire-county-council-green-masterplan
