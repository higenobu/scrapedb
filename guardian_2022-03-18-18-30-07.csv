3/18/2022,"The daughter of Anoosheh Ashoori, a British-Iranian businessman who returned to the UK this week after year’s of captivity in Iran, said they struggled to draw the media’s attention to her father’s plight because they did not see the family as “very relatable”. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Elika Ashoori said the family had experienced an “outpouring of love” since her father’s return but the last five years of his captivity had been very different and they had to fight for help. She said: “It has been a very big struggle trying to get my dad’s name out there, we were slightly more successful in the last year of our campaign because of the efforts of Amnesty and other organisations that finally joined us. “But because of his name, age, his looks, us being grown up children, and us not being very relatable so we couldn’t really engage on a major scale with the media and public no matter how hard we tried. “But regardless of that we have succeeded because he was included in the deal, so I think despite all that hardship we managed to strike a chord and keep his name out there and keep the momentum going for him to be included in the deal.” Ashoori, 67, and fellow British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 43, were released from the control of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps on Wednesday at Tehran international airport before being flown to Oman and then on to RAF Brize Norton. Iranian authorities arrested Ashoori in August 2017, when he was visiting his mother. In August 2019, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison – 10 years for allegedly “spying for Israel’s Mossad” and two years for “acquiring illegitimate wealth”. Ashoori denied both charges. The release was tied to the payment of a decades-old debt of nearly £400m, related to a failed arms deal in the 70s. Elika said the family would always question whether he could have been brought home sooner. She said: “Of course, there’s always that question which is something we will obviously be continuing to campaign for once we’ve regrouped because he wasn’t the only one and Nazanin wasn’t the only one taken through hostage diplomacy. “The debt being paid has managed to bring my dad and Nazanin home but there are also others, there are dual nationals still being detained. Until we get to the root cause of this problem we can’t prevent cases to happen in the future. “It’s OK to point fingers and say the blame is with this government or that government – at the end of the day we are the collateral damage. By paying one debt we’re not solving the issue. We have to get to the root cause of the problem and see why is it the world is allowing this barbaric practice to continue.” Elika said overall her father seemed fine and was “in good spirits” and while he had lost weight, he was “in general, healthy”. She said he was not “angry with the UK”, adding he was furious with Iranian officials and with the Iranian government for the way he had been treated.",News/UK news,Anoosheh Ashoori: daughter tells of struggle to publicise plight,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/18/anoosheh-ashoori-daughter-tells-of-struggle-to-publicise-plight
3/18/2022,"WeCrashed could equally well be named WeBoggle. This dramatisation of the already fairly dramatic real-life rise and fall of the property rental company WeWork is Apple TV+’s entry into the growing fashion for factually based dramas that have you rubbing your eyes in disbelief and then flailing around uselessly on the sofa trying to understand how, what, why and just how it all happened. WeCrashed begins in September 2019, the beginning of the end of WeWork, as its founder, Adam Neumann, would like to know it. He is played by Jared Leto, who just about manages to channel rather than impersonate the charismatic Israeli-accented serial entrepreneur, although he and Tom Hiddleston also seem to be converging in appearance, which is confusing at another level. Neumann is about to be removed as CEO of his own company by the board (led by Anthony Edwards, playing a similar but more savvy version of his financier role in Inventing Anna, another show about the willingness of people to believe in a reality constructed for them by someone with endless chutzpah, nary a jot of documentation and barely more cash than that). The unicorn – the tech industry term for a privately held startup that gets valued at more than $1bn – is about to be severely hobbled. We then jump back (and forth, a bit, but in not too vexing a manner over the eight episodes) to unpack the story of how Neumann and his wife/muse/cheerleader/enabler Rebekah (Anne Hathaway, just about navigating the journey from cousin of Gwyneth Paltrow ’n’ woo woo actress turned yoga teacher to billionaire ice queen) managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of triumph. As my entire education in and understanding of US company structures, shareholdings, buy-ins and buyouts comes from multiple viewings of the Mike Judge comedy Silicon Valley (Succession was too complex, I’m afraid) I cannot tell you quite how WeWork came to be valued at $47bn at its peak, nor why it fell to $10bn the moment someone looked at some actual documentation. But I think it’s something to do with the fact that Neumann was a spectacular salesman and his wife reflected him back at twice his natural size. And, of course, everyone got a bit blind to the fact that although WeWork’s buildings were filled with glamorous, trendy tech startups, it itself was a fairly standard real estate company. What “disruptive” innovation it seemed to sport was largely borrowed finery. Neumann’s $60m private jet probably didn’t help matters, either. Treating a company and its assets like your own personal fiefdom, even if you created it, tends not to end well. What WeCrashed doesn’t do is bring us much in the way of insight into the structures, systemsor mindset that allow this kind of extraordinary untethering from reality in a field that is supposedly full of the brightest and best number crunchers there are. It’s a wonderful and deeply enjoyable tale of rags to riches to (relative) rags, but it panders to the viewer’s schadenfreude instead of offering anything meatier, or any wider perspective or criticism. In fact, Judge’s Silicon Valley offers more in the way of analysis of the part greed and ambition play in skewing decision making, compromising people and principles and shaping every bend in the road between a vision and its eventual realisation. There also remains something to be made or written about the financial value of charisma – WeWork helmed by Neumann had an almost cultlike quality. What’s the premium on attractiveness versus business acumen? Should we expect investors – who are, however rich, still human – to be able to resist it, or should we price in the possibility that they are at least a bit susceptible to promises so powerfully made? Away from the business side of things, Leto and Hathaway create a convincing enough marriage between two narcissists (even if we cannot say, with its mix of simultaneously being supportive and toxic, how much it truly resembles the real thing). Yet they never really make their characters come alive as individuals. Their relationship buckles and bends under the pressures of near-bankruptcy and other self-induced vicissitudes of life – including Rebekah’s self-penned marriage vows, which anyone not directly related to Paltrow or to lesser Californians on both sides would be well advised to mute – but the couple (who now have five children) are still together today. So perhaps love really does conquer all? Or maybe just shared self-love? Or maybe only in the alt reality where we are all billionaires.",Arts/Television & radio,WeCrashed review – prepare to boggle at Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway’s toxic billionaires,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/18/wecrashed-review-prepare-to-boggle-at-jared-leto-and-anne-hathaways-toxic-billionaires
3/18/2022,"Sonic Youth’s 2011 split after the acrimonious divorce of key members Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore means a reunion is unlikely. Many will be grateful, then, for these remaining scraps from the alt-rock lynchpins’ table. Consisting of five largely unheard, mostly instrumental rarities from the band’s last 10 years, In/Out/In isn’t a “new” album by any means so much as tracks that remained underdeveloped or unfinished at the time. Two – In & Out and Out & In, recorded a decade apart – have been released physically before. The former, recorded in a soundcheck, is a Neu!-like groove with Gordon contributing gently hypnotic vocal mantras. The 12-minute latter starts as a driving groove with walls of guitars and suddenly shifts gear into an infectious hook. The shorter, punchier Machine hails from 2008 but harks back to their late 1980s/early 90s vintage, presumably losing out to stronger ideas for the final album, The Eternal. Social Static, a challenging soundtrack to Chris Habib and Spencer Tunick’s Super-8 film of the same title, finds them at their most dissonant, sculpting with distortion. Recorded in a basement during the final days of the band, opener Basement Contender is a delicately haunting, slightly Velvet Underground-ish instrumental on which you can really hear the band’s chemistry as they explore their way into the song and trade hypnotically pretty guitar lines. It’s easily the gem here and provides a tantalising glimpse of what might have been still to come.  In/Out/In is released on Three Lobed Recordings on 25 March",Arts/Music,Sonic Youth: In/Out/In review – tantalising scraps from end of an era,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/18/sonic-youth-in-out-in-review
3/18/2022,"Pablo Larraín revisits similar terrain to his 2016 film about Jackie Kennedy with this intimate drama focusing on Princess Diana, another iconic figure beset by tragedy. Gamely and unnervingly impersonated by Kristen Stewart, Diana is a woman on the verge. Duty-bound to attend a royal family Christmas at Sandringham in 1991, she rebels against her sterile marriage and suffocating public role. Despair soon leads to physical and mental disintegration. In a way, Diana was badly cast as a princess and Larraín makes us empathise with her stage fright – she can’t remember her lines, the costumes don’t fit and her audience is brutally unforgiving.Friday 25 March, Amazon Prime Video There’s a surreptitious flavour to Korean director Lee Chang-dong’s fine drama, adapted from a Haruki Murakami story. Yoo Ah-in stars as slightly gormless would-be writer Jong-su, who hooks up with an old schoolmate, Jeon Jong-seo’s restless Hae-mi. However, his place in her affections is soon usurped by Steven Yeun’s Ben – rich, self-assured, blandly enigmatic. Drifting almost imperceptibly from youthful romance to murky mystery, the film is deliciously disconcerting and, like Yeun’s pivotal performance, doesn’t appear to be trying too hard.Saturday 19 March, 10pm, BBC Four A group of dancers are celebrating the last night of rehearsals for their new show at a school building somewhere in France. Fatefully, someone has spiked the party punch with LSD and, this being a Gaspar Noé film, all hell breaks loose. The collapse of fellowship and social order in an already sexually febrile atmosphere is laid out in epically long takes, the camera swirling and staggering after the improvising actors as they succumb to hallucinations, paranoia, violence and desire. It’s a blunt-force approach, but deliriously effective.Saturday 19 March, 1.50am, Film4 This boisterous screen treatment of Alan Warner’s novel The Sopranos follows five Catholic girls from Fort William on a school choir day trip to Edinburgh in 1996. There’s no mob business here, though, just teenage hormones running rampant in the big city. Singing comes a distant second to illicit drinking and trying to get laid for a tight-knit group who each have their distinct dreams and hopes (or lack of hope). A frank, funny drama from Michael Caton-Jones, underlaid with coming-of-age poignancy and the ache of time passing.Sunday 20 March, 8.40am, 10.30pm, Sky Cinema Premiere Alfred Hitchcock’s classic 1946 thriller pairs Ingrid Bergman with Cary Grant to scintillating effect. She is the daughter of a wartime traitor; he is the agent who sends her undercover in Brazil to infiltrate the circle of neo-Nazi Claude Rains. She commits to her “Mata Hari” role while feeling demeaned by it – pointedly, the film exposes the gaslighting hypocrisy of her male handlers. Grant’s spy, however, has fallen for her and is torn between love and duty as she becomes increasingly compromised.Sunday 20 March, 7pm, Talking Pictures TV This one’s a real heartbreaker. David Lynch reined in his surrealist tendencies for this 1980 black-and-white drama about John Merrick, a real-life Victorian with severe deformities that brought him fame and notoriety. Anthony Hopkins is solid as Frederick Treves, the surgeon who rescues Merrick from a miserable life as a circus attraction, but it’s John Hurt’s performance in the title role that makes the film shine. Beneath layers of makeup, he gives Merrick a delicacy and pathos that lends the story an emotional resonance far beyond its “freakshow” tragedy.Monday 21 March, 12.15am, BBC Two A tough British drama that delves deeper into the headline-grabbing stories of city kids being sent to rural areas to deal drugs. Conrad Khan is excellent as the withdrawn, inarticulate 14-year-old Tyler, lured into criminality when his single mum Toni (the equally convincing Ashley Madekwe) loses her job. His descent into a life even more troubling than the one he is fleeing is given the social realist treatment by director Henry Blake, emphasising how easily young people like Tyler – who have few options and a lack of support – can be groomed.Friday 25 March, 10pm, BBC Three",Arts/Culture,Spencer to County Lines: the seven best films to watch on TV this week,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/18/spencer-to-county-lines-the-seven-best-films-to-watch-on-tv-this-week
3/18/2022,"I’m not proud of this fact, but over the course of the past 24 hours, and in defiance of a to-do list a mile long, I binged all eight episodes of Byron Baes, Netflix’s “first Australian reality show”. This is, obviously, what you are supposed to do with a show like Byron Baes, which is not a product to be savoured or lingered over. It is wholly contrived, full of horrible characters and premised on an idea of life in which words such as “wellness” play a meaningful role. It is also expertly designed to suck you into the drama and offer you respite from the real problems of the world. If there’s a squeamish element to watching Byron Baes, it is the knowledge that the show works by encouraging a specific response in audiences that might be summarised as hate therapy. The cast are all young, affluent and deluded to one degree or another, identifying as designers and influencers, and living in a coastal town that was at one time a hippy surfing community. A few years ago, American movie stars began moving in – the location is stunning – and the place became promptly appalling. As an Australian friend told me: “It’s been ruined by Hemsworths and Damons” – after which, the deluge: hordes of crystal-waving, linen-wearing Instagrammers who, inevitably after a few seasons, attracted the attention of Vanity Fair. In 2019, the magazine did a long piece about various eco-entrepreneurs in Byron Bay, one of whom specialised in “ethical bed linens for babies” while another eschewed the US because of its “consumerism”. That piece was the springboard for the show, and here we are. Fifteen years after the Kardashians first aired, it is curious to consider the evolution of the format, and the psychology of those who take part in it. Every episode of Byron Baes is organised around an event, either a product launch or a party, at which a confrontation between two or more characters is preordained. The show’s participants are, directly or otherwise, incentivised to compete for screen time through drama and to bring about various staged disagreements. The rest of the cast then picks a side and jumps in. It is a whisper away from being scripted and an enjoyment of the show is watching a group of people turned so inside out with self-consciousness that their performances are on a par with Mrs Overall in Acorn Antiques. And it’s cleverly edited to build in some surprises. Initially, I thought Hannah, who helps her parents run their online interiors business, was unremittingly awful, only to discover she’s among the most sympathetic characters in the cast. Jess, a designer, seemed vaguely self-aware for two episodes before descending into pot-stirring hell. Alex, a proxy for the regular person, rolls his eyes and barely belongs in this show, and Jade is straightforwardly dreadful throughout. Meanwhile, various large, male dimwits move around the landscape like those boulder people in Frozen II. Observing these characters is an old-school pleasure reminiscent of the first few seasons of Big Brother, with the added fascination of knowing that every one of them signed up fully aware of what they were getting into. Unlike TV talent shows, which prey on the genuinely desperate, it is hard to see much exploitation here, beyond something very broad about what happens when interior life is scooped out by Instagram fame. A theme of the show is authenticity, and the Byron Bay locals like to distinguish themselves from people from, for example, the Gold Coast, who are disparaged for having “spray-on dresses and fake lips”. With many lumbering cues, the show’s audience is invited to consider that Gold Coasters, with their tans and tiny dresses, live a more authentic existence than the parade of shallow oddballs in Byron Bay. Each character has, very obviously, made the calculation that exposure and the opportunities that come with it are worth the cost of derision. Elle throws a fundraiser to draw attention to the destruction of ocean life, at which she serves tuna canapés and is delivered cleanly to the audience on a plate. Jade, who presents like a creation of Sacha Baron Cohen’s, is exposed for allegedly buying his Instagram followers in Turkey. There are no politics in this show, except for something nebulous about unchecked privilege and the adoption of good causes for likes, an impulse, after all, not exclusive to Byron Bay. The show is a padded room, like one of those places you can pay to enter to safely break things and work out your anger. Netflix, by offering these people up for a universal disparagement unriven by the usual conflicts and divides, is practically providing us with a public service.

3/18/2022,"The boss of the maritime union Nautilus said the move by P&O Ferries to sack 800 British crew without warning represented “a new low” for the shipping industry, as he prepared to join protesters at Dover. Mark Dickinson, the general secretary of Nautilus International, said demonstrations were also planned in Hull and Liverpool on Friday. “This is a new low moment in history that everyone, including P&O directors, won’t forget,” he said, speaking on the BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme. “This is a new low for a shipping company. It is a dark day for the shipping industry. I have been in this industry for over 40 years and I’ve seen some curve balls and shocking developments but this is a new low for a shipping company – to treat due legal process in such an underhand and callous way has shocked me, it has taken my breath away.” Dickinson described how he saw “handcuff-trained, balaclava-wearing private security guards deployed” on Thursday. “To remove my members from their workplaces, from their homes, that is where they live when they are deployed to their vessels,” he said. “This is a moment in history that people won’t forget and I hope the directors of P&O and DP World never forget this day.” Dickinson said Nautilus and its sister union the RMT were “actively progressing” legal action over the move on Thursday by loss-making P&O Ferries, which is owned by Dubai-based DP World, to sack staff, halt services and look to bring in cheaper agency crew to run its vessels. “It is clearly illegal,” he said. “The company is duty-bound to consult with trade unions. We have have collective bargaining agreements for all the affected seafarers, for all the vessels on all the routes. We are actively progressing that.” Dickinson said the UK’s Maritime and Coastguard Agency would have to be “absolutely clear and confident” that the cheaper agency could do the job safely. “They are unfamiliar with the vessels, the routes, the berths. Crossing the English channel – the busiest shipping lane in the world – is like walking across a six-lane motorway at rush-hour,” he said. “This is an intensely worrying situation.”",News/Business,"Mass sacking by P&O Ferries ‘a new low’ for shipping, says union",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/18/mass-sacking-by-p-and-o-ferries-a-new-low-for-shipping-says-union
3/18/2022,"Even before Vladimir Putin declared a hunt for “national traitors” and a “fifth column” over his invasion of Ukraine this week, anti-war activists had faced increasing pressure, including police torture, intimidation tactics, work dismissals and other threats. In a police station in Moscow earlier this month, an anti-war protester managed to record her own beating as officers threatened her for taking part in peaceful demonstrations that have already seen nearly 15,000 people detained. “Place of study?” a policeman asks the student in the recording, which she published online. When she didn’t answer, they hit her. “You’ll have a bit of a bruise. Get up, try to remember.” Then they hit her again. In an interview with the Guardian, another student, Anastasia, 18, described being threatened for hours after being arrested for taking to the streets and chanting “No to war.” “They told me they would beat me and that they were going to throw us to the homeless, rape us,” she said. She added she had not been beaten but that officers grew violent with other activists as they refused to cooperate. “I think they would have said anything to get me to sign [the court order]… just not to have to deal with us.” Russia’s war has above all affected the lives of millions of Ukrainians, turning busy cities like Mariupol and Kharkiv into war-scarred battlegrounds and leaving thousands dead. But Russians have also woken up in a different country, one seeking internal enemies to blame for the country’s descent into economic isolation and hardship. In a dark speech on Wednesday, Vladimir Putin laid out his vision for the new Russia, calling for a “cleansing” of “national traitors” in what sounded like an announcement of open season on dissidents. The west “are going to bet on the so-called fifth column, on national traitors,” said Putin using language that critics have called fascist. “The Russian people will be able to distinguish true patriots from scum and traitors and simply spit them out like a fly that accidentally flew into their mouths. “I am convinced that such a natural and necessary cleansing of society will only strengthen our country,” he added. For those with the temerity to oppose the war, it is clear who Putin has in mind. “It’s about us all. You can choose a role for me [from the speech]. A traitor, a fascist,” said Anastasia, the student. “It’s an attack on everyone who is against this war.” The war has accelerated Russia’s slide from authoritarianism to totalitarianism. For years, police have tightened their grip on the opposition, both jailing top critics like Alexei Navalny and learning how to put down large protests. “You can see this as the result of these years of preparations,” said Daniil Beilinson of OVD-Info, which has published a report on official pressure on the anti-war movement. Now the launch of the war has untied the hands of both law enforcement and dangerous patriotic elements. Pro-Kremlin activists have adopted the letter Z, a tactical symbol painted on some Russian military vehicles in Ukraine, as a symbol of support for the war. The state-financed outlet RT has sold T-shirts with the symbol on it, while others have used it to threaten opponents of the war. When Marina Davydova found a white Z graffitied on her doorway at home and suspected her phone was tapped, friends began to tell her it was time to go. The theatre critic had been an early and vocal critic of Russia’s war in Ukraine, publishing a petition to oppose the invasion. Now, she was receiving a torrent of emailed threats. When she left the country, video of her leaving her flat was leaked online. Even at the border, she was interrogated by a guard who said that her Schengen visa was not enough reason to leave the country. The speed of the transformation surprised her, she said. “Even a month ago I couldn’t have imagined this,” she said from an undisclosed location in Europe. Of Putin’s speech about “national traitors” and a “fifth column,” she said: “Before, this rhetoric was used only by [radicals], but now it is being uttered by the president. It’s horrible!” Others had faced backlash at work or other forms of pressure for opposing the war. One Russian doctor said he had fled the country to Serbia after sharing an anti-war petition with colleagues. “At first they suggested I resign but then they gave me a back way out” by taking his remaining vacation, he said. “We were living normally a month ago, what is this fucking shit all around us now?” Other professional groups have been forced to hide the names on their anti-war petitions to protect themselves from violent reprisals. Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, told reporters on Thursday that all these people were effectively traitors. “They vanish from our lives on their own,” he said. “Some quit their jobs, some leave active service, some leave the country and move to others. That’s how [Russia] is cleansed. Some break the law and are punished by the courts.” For some forced to leave, they can barely recognise the country where they once lived. “I have a different Russia,” Davydova wrote in a post about leaving the country. “It didn’t begin a ‘special operation.’ It held festivals, organised unbelievable exhibits, made foreigners fall in love with here. That Russia itself has been abused, raped, declared an enemy and arrested. I do not know if she will be free. I hope she just will exist.”",News/World news,‘It’s an attack on everyone’: Russian activists under increasing pressure for opposing war on Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/its-an-attack-on-everyone-russian-activists-under-increasing-pressure-for-opposing-war-on-ukraine
3/18/2022,"This is a touching if a tad treacly portrait of Ady Barkan, an inspiring American activist who has the terminal neurodegenerative disease ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis AKA motor neurone disease). Filmed over several years and directed by Nicholas Bruckman, it starts with Barkan, originally a lawyer, already well into his career as a protester and campaigner, particularly on issues that affect people on low incomes. When first met he seems like a loving family man, devoted to his wife Rachael, an academic, and their adorable baby son Carl. But then he’s diagnosed with ALS, and naturally everything changes. The film includes a tearful, wrenching clip he shot himself in the middle of the night after he found out and couldn’t sleep for worry. His health seems to deteriorate quickly – though perhaps that’s partly an effect of the cinematic compression of time. Even so, as the indominable little Carl gets bigger and stronger and the Trump administration wreaks more and more havoc on the nation and the world, Barkan gradually loses the ability to walk, talk or even breathe by himself. Amazingly, that doesn’t stop him from campaigning; he shifts his focus on to the threats to public healthcare and provision for people with pre-existing conditions like himself. In a famous viral clip filmed by friend and fellow activist Elizabeth Jaff, he debates the issue with Republican senator Jeff Flake on a plane. Although he doesn’t manage to persuade Flake to change his vote, the encounter triggered Barkan’s Be a Hero campaign which seeks, in addition to advocating for various progressive issues, to influence potentially persuadable Republicans such as Susan Collins to vote against, say, Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the supreme court. The struggle ends up cornering Flake in another confrontation, this time involving Ana Maria Archila in an elevator, cheered on by Barkan. Smart, funny and endearingly sweary even when he loses the power to speak without computer assistance, Barkan is a charismatic character who’s easy to like, although one wonders how much the documentary crew resisted showing anything that might dent the halo the film sets round his head. At one point, Barkan talks about his own feelings of guilt for being out on the road so much and missing his children’s early years (Rachael has a second child in due course); maybe it wouldn’t have hurt to probe further what price people like Barkan pay for their own heroism.

At least three blasts were heard at about 6am on Friday, preceded by the sound of air raid sirens, as a mushroom-shaped plume of smoke could be seen rising in the sky. Lviv’s mayor, Andriy Sadovy, said the civilian airport had not been hit and that authorities were assessing the situation and would issue updates.

3/18/2022,"The great jazz pianist Brad Mehldau has long relished ambiguities above predictable outcomes, and delicacy over muscle, but it was 70s prog-rock that obsessed him in his classical-pianist childhood, and indirectly became his route into jazz via the 70s/80s electric music of Miles Davis, Weather Report and the Mahavishnu Orchestra. Jacob’s Ladder is the latest of several hard-hitting electronic hybrids that he has scattered as tributes to that past among his beautifully crafted acoustic chamber-jazz ventures over the years. Some might flinch at the core materials here – prog rock and Christian scriptures – but this epic venture’s panoramic soundscape, storyteller’s control of dynamics, and canny use of guest players including country-music mandolinist/singer Chris Thile and jazz/hip-hop drums maestro Mark Guiliana, show how far Mehldau has come as a sophisticated manipulator of complex materials. He audaciously transfers a line from Canadian prog trio Rush’s 1981 hit Tom Sawyer to a child’s classical-treble vocal register for the haunting Maybe As His Skies Are Wide. Prog-metal vocal ranting mixes with massed-keyboard countermelodies on the hurtling Herr und Knecht. And Gentle Giant’s Cogs in Cogs becomes the Becca Stevens vocal centrepiece to a three-part mini-suite shifting from skimming keyboard improv over racing drums to synth-painted baroque counterpoint in its finale. A Weather Report-ish groove and an agile piano/mandolin dialogue illuminate Tom Sawyer, and the title track splices biblical recitation, rapturous choral sounds and plenty of jazzy jamming. Hardcore proggers may be a shade perplexed by Mehldau’s use of their heroes’ hits, and though preacherly Christianity is discreet, it’s certainly in earshot. But it’s possible just to relish a unique contemporary musician’s ingenious mingling of a traditional and contemporary sound palette, with plenty of characteristically freewheeling jazz detours on the way. On Gaya (Trouble in the East Records), the prizewinning Berlin saxophonist/composer Silke Eberhard uses an enhanced “XL” version of her Eric Dolphy-celebrating Potsa Lotsa band in a global-jazzy way on collaborations with South Korea’s Youjin Sung, a virtuoso on the region’s zither-like gayageum. Eberhard’s warmly ingenious band writing occasionally jars with the gayageum’s brittle, exclamatory plucked sounds, but Gaya nonetheless rings with enigmatic melodies, provocative harmonies and bursts of street-vibe hustle. Wayne Shorter’s Panamanian pianist/composer Danilo Pérez showcases his exciting multinational Global Messengers group on Crisálida (Mack Avenue), playing two new suites bridging Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, African American and Latin influences, Panamanian dances, Spanish rap and imaginative reworkings of what the blues mean in the globalised 21st century.",Arts/Music,"Brad Mehldau: Jacob’s Ladder review – prog rock and Bible stories make for unique, ingenious jazz",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/18/brad-mehldau-jacobs-ladder-review-jazz
