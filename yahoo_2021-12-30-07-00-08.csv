12/30/2021,"By Nancy Lapid    (Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review.    Omicron cannot escape body's second-line defense    A key part of the immune system's second-line defense - its T cells - are highly effective at recognizing and attacking the Omicron variant, thereby preventing most infections from progressing to critical illness, a new study shows.    Omicron's mutations help it escape from antibodies, the body's first line of defense against infection. Researchers have speculated that other components of the immune response would still target Omicron, but there has been no proof until now.    In test tube experiments, researchers in South Africa exposed copies of the virus to T cells from volunteers who had received vaccines from Johnson & Johnson or Pfizer/BioNTech or who had not been vaccinated but had developed their own T cells after infection with an earlier version of the coronavirus.    ""Despite Omicron's extensive mutations and reduced susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies, the majority of T cell response, induced by vaccination or natural infection, cross-recognizes the variant,"" the researchers reported on Tuesday on medRxiv ahead of peer review.    ""Well-preserved T cell immunity to Omicron is likely to contribute to protection from severe COVID-19,"" which supports what South African doctors had initially suspected when most patients with Omicron infections did not become seriously ill, they said.    The ""T"" stands for thymus, the organ in which the cells' final stage of development occurs.    Boosters reduce risk of Omicron household transmission    The odds that vaccinated people will catch the virus if a household member becomes infected are nearly three to four times higher with Omicron than with Delta, but booster doses reduce that risk, new findings suggest.    Researchers analyzed transmission data collected from nearly 12,000 infected households in Denmark, including 2,225 households with an Omicron infection. Overall, there were 6,397 secondary infections in the week after the first infection in the house. After accounting for other risk factors, the rate of person-to-person spread of the virus to fully vaccinated people was roughly 2.6 times higher in Omicron households than in Delta households, the researchers reported on Monday on medRxiv ahead of peer review. Booster-vaccinated people were nearly 3.7 times more likely to get infected in the Omicron households than in the Delta households, they found.    Looking only at Omicron households, however, booster-vaccinated people were 56% less likely to become infected compared to vaccinated people who had not received a booster. And overall, when booster-vaccinated people were the ones who first brought home the virus, they were less likely than unvaccinated and vaccinated-but-not-boosted people to pass it to others.    Click for a Reuters graphic https://tmsnrt.rs/3c7R3Bl on vaccines in development.    (Reporting by Nancy Lapid; Editing by Howard Goller) ",Health/Reuters,Omicron cannot escape T cells; boosters protect households from Omicron,https://news.yahoo.com/omicron-cannot-escape-t-cells-202413250.html
12/30/2021,"Donald Trump's oldest child Donald Trump Jr. turns 44 on December 31. He has five children with ex-wife Vanessa Trump and speaks Czech fluently.

Donald Trump Jr. has a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Finance. Trump Jr. graduated in 2000. Donald Trump Sr. also attended Wharton. He worked as a bartender for a year in Aspen, Colorado, after college, and wrote that his drinking became a ""recipe for disaster."" In 2001, Trump Jr. spent 11 hours in jail after he was arrested and charged with public drunkenness. ""Once I got going, it wasn't easy to stop me — which, when you're in college, isn't a huge problem, as long as you're getting your work done,"" Trump Jr. wrote in his 2019 book ""Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us."" ""But once I started thinking about a career and a life beyond school, it was. To be honest, I didn't know how to drink in moderation."" He has since given up drinking. ""I have an all-or-nothing personality; just ask anyone who knows me,"" Trump Jr. wrote in ""Triggered."" ""Being compulsive works for some things — give me a job to do, and I'm going to get it done — but it's not so good for vices."" He continued: ""One thing about us Trumps is that we have plenty of willpower. I would come to find that it was easier for me to ignore alcohol than it was to try to control it. Eventually, I would give up drinking for good."" Trump Jr.'s father introduced him to his first wife Vanessa Haydon at a fashion show where she was modeling. Trump Jr. recalled the awkward moment his father introduced them in a 2006 New York Times profile, saying that Haydon looked at them ""like we're taking crazy pills."" ""You know, I'm 25 at the time, I did perfectly well with girls. It wasn't really my M.O. to have my father try to pick up girls for me,"" he said. He and Vanessa had five children together before divorcing in 2018. The oldest child is daughter Kai Madison, followed by Donald John III, Tristan Milos, Spencer Frederick, and Chloe Sophia.
