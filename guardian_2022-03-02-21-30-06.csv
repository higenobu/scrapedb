3/2/2022,"On Sunday, Vladimir Putin ordered his nuclear deterrent forces to be placed on a “special regime of combat duty”. The Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has now clarified what this meant: the increased manpower devoted to Russia’s strategic nuclear triad: land-based strategic nuclear rocket forces, sea-based nuclear deterrents in the northern and Pacific fleets and its fleet of long-range strategic bomber aircraft that can carry nuclear weapons. This is not a big change in the state of Russia’s nuclear arsenal, which remains on a certain level of readiness even during peacetime. US and UK officials have suggested that they have observed no change in Russia’s force posture. This means, for example, that they have not observed the dispersal of land-based missiles, the loading of aircraft with nuclear warheads, or movement in the central storages where Russia keeps its sub-strategic nuclear warheads. So why would Putin announce to the world that he has increased nuclear readiness? The invasion of Ukraine has probably produced a more severe situation than the Russian leadership anticipated. The invasion is not going according to plan, while the big western response has employed the full range of available capabilities short of direct military assistance to Ukraine. So Putin is seeking, as he has many times before, to influence the western calculus by repeating that a confrontation with Russia would entail a significant nuclear risk. He refers to the west’s aggressive rhetoric towards Russia as justifying this action. To Moscow, the situation is now grave enough to gesture at its nuclear options. It remains unlikely that Putin is seriously considering the suicidal act of using nuclear weapons against western countries. Still, there are some concerning developments that bring the possibility of limited nuclear use into play. Prior to this conflict, Russia’s nuclear threshold – a willingness to use nuclear weapons in a conflict – had seemingly remained relatively high. For the past 12 years, its military doctrine has stated that it would consider nuclear use only in situations that threaten the very existence of the state. Most analysts surmised that this would mean a conflict where Russian territory is under severe attack. Russia does not need to use these weapons in Ukraine to produce the military outcome it seeks. We have still not seen the full Russian conventional force brought to bear. Russian military practice would still qualify this as a local conflict. The role of nuclear weapons in such conflicts is to deter further escalation, in this case by preventing direct western support. However, Russia’s recent statements and behaviour are reason for concern. There is some uncertainty about what precisely it means when it talks about existential threats. Observers point to Putin’s past statements that “there could be no world without Russia” as concerning. The current situation may also cause Russia to revise its playbook. Its leaders had not foreseen that the west would unite with such a potent response. Western countries are applying a broad range of tools to apply maximum pressure. It could be that Russia perceives the economic, political and military pressure it is under as an existential threat. Western unity may also increase the Russian paranoia regarding an actual western intervention. The other reason for concern is Putin’s state of mind. His rhetoric is becoming more extreme by the day, and the spectacles of his cabinet meetings are disturbing. There is speculation about the effect Covid isolation had on his mind. His inner circle now only comprises hardliners, and the information he is provided with may be skewed. We don’t know if there is any real debate of policy options. Will Russian political or military advisers say no to Putin, or disagree with him? Will defence minister Shoigu and chief of the general staff Valery Gerasimov stall or endorse the idea of nuclear use? Fortunately, the Russian system is one where Putin is forced to consult them before issuing an order. The most concerning scenario is one in which Putin is pressed into a corner, with no off-ramp, and the perception that he has nothing more to lose. In such circumstances, it could be possible to imagine a very limited Russian nuclear strike – the purpose of which would be to produce a disruption to the conflict, a reason for pause and potentially force an adversary into submission. In the past, Russian strategists have deliberated the possibility that nuclear weapons could be used in this way. But Russian leaders cannot know whether they will get the expected result by crossing the nuclear threshold. There is no way they can predict how the world will respond if they break the “nuclear taboo” that has been in place since the second world war. They do know that the risks would be enormous, indeed, existential. They also worry about how nuclear escalation can be controlled. They know that nuclear war is the most dangerous scenario they could face. In the past year, Putin has twice endorsed bi- and multilateral statements conveying that “a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought”. Let’s hope this lingers as he ponders his next move in Ukraine.

3/2/2022,"Oil and gas prices are soaring, with prices at UK petrol pumps hitting a new high as Russia’s escalating invasion of Ukraine continues to cause turmoil in the energy markets. The price of a barrel of Brent crude oil moved past $111 (£83) on Wednesday, its highest level since early July 2014, despite a decision by the US to release, with its allies, about 60m barrels from their strategic reserves, in an attempt to stabilise global energy markets. Gas prices also rose, with the UK’s rising almost 40% to 398p a therm in morning trading, not far from the all-time high above 450p seen in late 2021. The increase threatens to exacerbate a cost of living crisis that has prompted predictions of £3,000-a-year energy bills for households in Great Britain, with rising energy prices set to pile further pressure on already soaring inflation. Russia continues to pump supplies into Europe but the war in Ukraine threatens near-term disruption and is increasingly isolating the world’s second-largest producer of oil and gas from global energy markets. BP, Shell, ExxonMobil and the British Gas owner, Centrica, have vowed to unwind billions of pounds worth of Russian ties in recent days. On Wednesday, the organisers of the annual World Energy Congress, due to be held in Russia, looked poised to cancel the event as sponsors reviewed their participation. Despite the soaring price, the Opec oil cartel and its allies are likely to stick to modest plans for output rises when they meet later on Wednesday, officials have said. Increased production typically relieves pressure on global prices. The average cost of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts was at a fresh high of 151.67p on Tuesday, up from 151.16p on Monday, according to the data firm Experian Catalist. The average cost of a litre of diesel is also at a record high, reaching 155.23p. RAC’s fuel spokesperson, Simon Williams, said: “If oil does stay at this level, the journey to an average unleaded price of 155p may be far too quick.” This year’s World Energy Congress, a regular meeting of politicians and energy industry luminaries, is scheduled to be held in St Petersburg in October. However, with Russia increasingly seen as a pariah on the political stage as well as among energy companies, it is thought to be on the verge of being cancelled. The World Energy Council, a registered charity, chooses the location of the congress every year based on votes from its 77 member states, including the US and Russia. Representatives of those countries are meeting this week to decide whether the triennial event can go ahead. In previous years the conference has been sponsored by London-based corporations, including BP and the accounting firm EY. EY told the Guardian: “The support and participation of EY at the 25th World Energy Congress in St Petersburg is under review and we cannot comment further at this stage.” BP said it had not planned to sponsor the St Petersburg event. The website for the St Petersburg event, bearing the tagline “energy for humanity”, displays a list of sponsors made up solely of Russian companies. It still claims to be expecting 18,000 attendees form 150 countries, including 70 government ministers.",News/Business,Oil and gas prices soar as fallout from Russia’s Ukraine attack intensifies,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/02/oil-and-gas-prices-soar-as-russia-attack-on-ukraine-intensifies
3/2/2022,"For approximately a full hour, the latest episode of Marc Maron’s WTF podcast goes absolutely swimmingly. The episode’s guest, Sam Elliott, rumbles on amiably about all manner of subjects, and he seems to be building a genuine rapport with Maron. And then, almost as a closing afterthought, Maron asks Elliott: “Did you see Power of the Dog?” And then everything went to hell. “Yeah, you wanna talk about that piece of shit?” Elliott growls. Maron laughs a stunned “Oh no”, and then Elliott proceeds to give the weirdest take on a film that may have ever been spoken aloud. “There was a fuckin’ full page ad out in the LA Times, and there was a clip, and it talked about the evisceration of the American myth. And I thought ‘What the fuck? What the fuck?’ … What are all those dancers, those guys in New York that wear bowties and not much else? That’s what all these fucking cowboys in that movie looked like, running around in chaps and no shirts. There were all these allusions to homosexuality throughout the fucking movie.” At this point, Maron steps in. “I think that’s what the movie’s about”, he suggests, not incorrectly. “Well, what the fuck does this woman from down there – she’s a brilliant director – know about the American west, and why the fuck did she shoot this movie in New Zealand and call it Montana? That fucking rubbed me the wrong way.” Honestly, where to start? The primary takeaway, which has already been covered in several thousand headlines elsewhere, is that Elliott doesn’t seem to care for gay people very much. Towards the end of the WTF episode, he justifies his weird rant by pointing out that he had just been spending time in the American west, surrounded by families – “Not men, families” – suggesting that this is the true depiction of the cowboys that he’d like to see on screen. But, really, it just sounds like Elliott simply hadn’t done his research. The Power of the Dog is a resoundingly queer movie. It’s based on a book that was written by a gay man about his experiences in the west, and almost every review written about the film has mentioned the closeted longing at the heart of the film within the first few sentences. In a recent Vanity Fair interview, Benedict Cumberbatch had to defend himself against accusations of appropriation for taking the role. But maybe Elliott didn’t read that issue of Vanity Fair. Maybe he was put off by all the swans on the cover. His suggestion that the film isn’t a true reflection of the west also needs to be picked apart. First, it’s slightly ridiculous to assume that a forcefield is in place across the entire American west that sucks the gayness out of anyone who crosses it. But mainly – even if by some statistical impossibility – he is right, then what business does he have to say that all films have to be a true depiction of real life? Elliott has racked up more than 100 acting credits across the course of his 55-year career, and it’s not an exaggeration to say that some of them have been complete cobblers. Take the 1972 film Frogs, which climaxes in a scene where hundreds of frogs stare at a man until he has a heart attack. Or 2018’s The Man Who Killed Hitler and Then the Bigfoot, where he plays a man who has to stop a deadly global virus by literally murdering a Sasquatch. Or the cartoon Rock Dog, where he played a wise old yak named Fleetwood Yak. My favourite of Elliott’s gripes, though, is that Jane Campion had the temerity to shoot a western in New Zealand. Imagine how furious he’s going to be when he hears about Sergio Leone, or any of the other spaghetti western directors. Imagine how angry he’ll be when he realises they shot the newest Batman film in Scotland. Imagine the rage when he realises that Robert Downey Jr didn’t actually go into space in those Avengers movies. Really, all this newest WTF incident shows is that we should feel bad for Elliott. He’s the only film star alive who doesn’t appear to know how films work.

3/2/2022,"Think global … think local, no? It feels strange to write it because of course, everything on our planet is interdependent: our oceans, weather systems, knowledge systems, politics, certainly people. So, the idea that we should categorise anything as global literature seems counterintuitive; as if everything is not at once local and global. In my novel, How to Be a Revolutionary, I seek out interconnectedness, testing and pulling at the idea of nationhood. The following are 10 books that view the world in a similar way, giving meaning and shape to what it means to be human. 1. Cloud Atlas by David MitchellFew can cross the centuries, bending genres and language, so that it works effortlessly on the page. From the South Pacific in the mid-19th century to a dystopian, ultimately consumerist future Korea, Cloud Atlas presents a case for the universality of human nature. It’s a joyful, poignant re-read, 18 years after the novel was first published and especially when this notion of what binds us appears to be in question again. 2. Intimacies by Katie KitamuraA meticulous, compelling work of fiction. Kitamura doesn’t reveal much: not a protagonist’s name or physical description. We do know that the main character has come to The Hague to work as an interpreter. It is complex, emotionally fraught work that follows her, however much she tries to compartmentalise. Probably a woman of Asian heritage who grew up in New York, the interpreter is also surveying the city from its margins. She brings an outsider’s eye to the everyday and the larger questions: who holds power and the ability to manipulate it, intimately, and also globally? 3. The Dragonfly Sea by Yvonne Adhiambo OwuorOwuor’s rich prose makes a pointed commentary in this novel about interconnectedness, however unlikely it may seem. Ayaana, born on Pate off the coast of Kenya, is of distant Chinese descent. Centuries earlier, when Chinese sailors were shipwrecked off the African coast, they made the island their home. Presenting equal parts opportunity and burden, Ayaana becomes something of a poster child when she is offered a scholarship to study in China. 4. Homegoing by Yaa GyasiIn this much-lauded debut, the author casts her eye back in time, and across the world, locating something of what troubles it still. Two very different life trajectories await half-sisters Effia and Esi and their progeny, seven generations into the future. Unaware of the other, one sister is elevated out of poverty when she is married off to a British man, while the other is enslaved and shipped to the US. In the series of interlinked stories, the author confronts African complicity in the slave trade as well as the enduring effects of British and American colonisation, and of slavery. 5. The Quiet American by Graham GreeneWhen Greene first published this novel in 1955, he and his book were condemned as anti-American. Greene was a journalist who had spent time in Saigon and like one of the novel’s main characters, Thomas Fowler, observed America’s foreign policy in Vietnam: the cultural blundering and disastrous intervention. The novel was adapted twice for the screen. In the first, the ending was changed to be less critical of the US and the second – despite coming almost 50 years after the novel was published – was shelved for a year after September 2011, given the producer’s concerns about perceptions of it being unpatriotic. Sixty-seven years after it was first published, the story continues to resonate. 6. Desertion by Abdulrazak GurnahThe Nobel laureate’s novels dispense with any idea of a world that is not interconnected. In Desertion, Gurnah spins a complex tale that deals with politics, colonialism, race, racism and abandonment, through the prism of two tragic love affairs, decades apart, on the island of Zanzibar. It is a slow-burning novel with dual narratives: an Englishman, Martin Pearce, falls in love with Rehana (the daughter of an Indian man and a local woman of minority-Arabic heritage). The second doomed love affair is that of their granddaughter, Jamila, and the narrator’s brother, Amin, on the eve of Tanzanian independence. Much as they try, the characters cannot unwrite or outrun history. 7. Home Fire by Kamila ShamsieBased on Antigone by Sophocles, this novel considers frankly, and often despairingly, what it has meant to be a Muslim during the last decade or two. The novel centres two families and their offspring: the orphaned Isma and younger twins, Aneeka and Parvais, and, Eamonn Lone, the son of a Muslim British diplomat who has yet to come to terms with his own identity. Though the book necessarily strays from the original tale, elements remain. The climax of this exquisite book, even while expected, is nonetheless shocking and the story lingers long after novel is read. 8. A Spy in Time by Imraan CoovadiaHere, respected South African author Coovadia departs somewhat from literary fiction to write a work that mixes genres: speculative, spy thriller, and then some. After an apocalyptic event, Earth’s survivors must rebuild a civilisation below ground. The delicate thread of time must be maintained between Marrakech in 1955, Johannesburg in 2271, Rio in 1967, and on Jupiter in a distant future. The fascinating conceit is that dark-skinned people dominate the future, and anyone born without it must go to absurd lengths to conceal their whiteness. 9. The Flamethrowers by Rachel KushnerKushner (who has raced bikes herself) writes luminous sentences that bring the American landscape into view. She doesn’t blink: not from an art scene hollowed of meaning, or a world profoundly linked by sometimes terrible deeds. In 1976, budding artist Reno joins the Moto Valera crew, who will help her break the women’s world racing record. The novel cuts from New York art scene of the 1970s, to Italian fascists during the second world war, to indigenous Brazilian workers, exploited to produce the rubber for the motorcycle’s tyres, with profits flowing via Switzerland to Europe. 10. Shalimar the Clown by Salman RushdieIt’s never quiet or dull in a Rushdie novel. Here, main character India (she hates her name) born to a Kashmiri mother and an American father, sees her father’s murdered body on her doorstop. The novel dips into Los Angeles in the 1990s, Kashmir, France, England, the past, into fable and sorcery, and back again. Rushdie writes: “Everywhere was now a part of everywhere else … Our lives, our stories, flowed into one another’s, were no longer our own, individual, discrete.” How to Be a Revolutionary by CA Davids is published by Verso.

3/2/2022,"It’s an intense, 86-minute pleasure to be in the company of Don Letts: DJ, film-maker, musician, social commentator and thoroughly engaging raconteur. Every word that comes out of his mouth is a manifesto for humanity and creativity. “Punk rock’s a living thing,” he says, “something to look forward to, not look back on.” Letts became part of the punk scene in late-70s London, befriending everyone from Malcolm McLaren to Bob Marley; he was DJing at the Roxy in Covent Garden, and with his pioneering choice of reggae records, Letts almost single-handedly made allies of punk and Jamaican music and struck a powerful cultural blow against racism. He also, with his Super-8 camera, shot vivid and intense footage of bands including the Sex Pistols and the Clash playing live which has become an indispensable archival resource for anyone making films or TV programmes about punk. From there, he had a thriving career as a music video director, worked with Mick Jones to set up Big Audio Dynamite and carried on making feature films. This movie retells the gripping story of a rebellious kid who actually set fire to his classroom desk (how many rock legends can claim anything comparable for their early years?) and became a cultural maven, someone restlessly, passionately interested in music and film. Letts is a brilliant entrepreneur, an inter-disciplinary artist and eloquent speaker about what life was like in the punk era, and despite his (correct) refusal to see things in these tiresomely nostalgist or sentimental terms, there is a pang in recognising the spark of that time. He is shown actually unwrapping a brand-new audiocassette to put into his tape deck; I thought you could only get those things on eBay, but no. Letts is an evangelist for musical possibility.

3/2/2022,"Ihad a revelation in Sparkbrook last summer. That revelation came flecked with green chilli and wrapped in a roti, and it was that, good as French omelettes might be, the Indian subcontinent arguably does them better. The masala omelette, or desi omelette, as it’s sometimes known, is a classic: a quick, filling breakfast for millions around the world, whether enjoyed at home in Lahore, by the roadside in Mumbai or in a cafe in Birmingham with a hot cup of chai on the side. Though omelettes have been known in France, and Britain, since the Middle Ages, it seems probable that the idea originally came from Persia, and early European recipes called for them to be fried on both sides, just like a desi omelette. You can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs but after that, anything goes. The creamy texture I like best in a French omelette is, in my opinion, achieved by beating the eggs lightly, so they’re well combined but without incorporating a lot of air into the mixture. Fans of the desi omelette, however, seem to prize a certain airiness of texture, with the Times of India instructing readers to “beat the eggs till frothy (the more you beat the egg the fluffier it will come out to be)”. To this end, some recipes also add milk, whose steam will help create little air bubbles in the end result, though I think it dilutes the richness of the eggs, so I’m willing to sacrifice a little fluff in the service of flavour. I also, because the idea intrigues me, try a vegan take on the masala omelette from The Girl with a Spoon blog by a self-described “super foodie” called Madhura from Gurgaon, just south-west of Delhi. Instead of eggs, she makes a pancake-like batter with chickpea and rice flour, then proceeds as normal. The idea is a good one: because of the other ingredients in a masala omelette, the lack of egg is less noticeable than it would be in a plainer dish – though I think our cups must be different sizes, because I have to add a lot more liquid than is called for, and end up with a vast, thick pancake that’s hard to flip, while the one in the picture is thin and golden, almost like a dosa. So, vegans, you might need to play around a bit with the base, but I reckon the results are worth it. You could leave the eggs be, and let the fillings do the talking, as in Asma Khan’s recipe, but in for a penny, in for a pound, and I miss the warmth that dried spices bring to proceedings: Mowgli’s Nisha Katona uses ground cumin and coriander, Meera Sodha and Maunika Gowardhan use turmeric and chilli powder, Tina, the Keralan cook behind the Kaipunyam blog, garam masala and Madhura turmeric and asafoetida, which is often included in vegan recipes to replicate the slightly sulphurous flavour of eggs. Up to you, but I like the earthiness of cumin, and am rather taken by cook, food stylist and photographer Shayma Owaise Saadat’s suggestion of roughly crushed whole seeds, which will also add texture, as well as turmeric for its bright colour and subtle bitterness. Onions of some sort are a must for me; Katona uses red ones, which are probably closest to the pink onions common in the subcontinent, and Gowardhan, Tina and Madhura yellow ones, but I favour Sodha’s spring onions, because an omelette cooks so quickly that, unless you soften the chopped onion first, as Katona suggests, you’ll end up with crunchy, semi-raw onion (which I know others are fine with; I’m just not, especially first thing in the morning). The sharp, fresh flavour of spring onions also works well with the sweetness of the chopped tomatoes I like in Gowardhan and Madhura’s recipes, though, as with the peppers and other veg some call for, they’re very much optional. I wouldn’t, however, leave out the green chillies; you could swap them for Katona’s red if you crave heat, but I enjoy the herbaceous flavour of the green sort. They, and the chopped coriander that she, Sodha and Gowardhan also put in, give the whole thing a delicious freshness. Those who are less keen on coriander’s flavour should at least consider a Keralan-style masala omelette with curry leaves instead. (Tina also flavours hers with grated coconut, which gives it a lovely, chewy texture – I’m going to keep my basic recipe simpler, but do give it a try if you have some knocking around.) If you’re new to the masala omelette game, forget everything you know about French-style omelettes; you need plenty of oil and a medium heat, because this omelette is going to be on there for longer than a soft, runny one, and you don’t want to burn it. Leave the omelette until it’s cooked through and beginning to colour on the bottom before flipping it to brown the other side. (To make it a bit more substantial, you could add a big handful of grated cheese, as Katona does, and finish it under the grill rather than turning it over.) Though, of course, it will be delicious on its own, the masala omelette is even better paired with bread; at Mowgli, they roll it into a chapati with chutney, Gowardhan likes it stuffed into bread with a spritz of lemon juice and dunked in sweet chilli sauce and ketchup, while Sodha recommends putting it between two slices of buttered toast and finishing it off with ketchup and a Bollywood soundtrack.

3/2/2022,"The Russia-Ukraine war was always going to have a very major cyber component. And, in the past week, we have seen just how much the war is playing out online, on a wide array of fronts. Given what we know and expect from Russia, it’s unlikely to come as a shock that – according to data from Checkpoint Research – in the first three days of combat, cyber-attacks on Ukraine’s government and military sector went up by 196%, compared to the rest of February. But what has been interesting to watch has been the fightback, with attacks on Russia up 4% for the week. It might not sound like much, but there has been noticeable pushback from white hat hackers, hactivist groups and others on the counterattack. Meanwhile, Ukraine has launched its own volunteer IT army, looking to respond to Russian cyber-attacks. Ukraine’s deputy PM Mykhailo Fedorov made the announcement on Telegram, stating: We have a lot of talented Ukrainians in the digital sphere: developers, cyber specialists, designers, copywriters, marketers … We continue to fight on the cyber front. A separate Telegram channel, reported to contain 175,000 people, is used to assign tasks such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on key Russian websites including government sites, banks, and energy businesses. Russian state media site Tass has also been targeted by hackers to show the number of Russian casualties. The conflict has even drawn division among ransomware groups. The Conti group had its internal communications leaked this week by a pro-Ukraine member who was angry that the group had sided with Russia. Rife misinformation As with any major news event, misinformation and disinformation are everywhere on social media. Beyond the expected viral videos or photos that turn out to be old or completely unrelated, there’s already evidence that disinformation is circulating from pro-Russian forces. Both Twitter and Facebook reported this week that they removed two pro-Russian covert influence operations from Russia and Belarus. Meta’s head of security Nathaniel Gleicher and director of threat disruption David Agranovich said the operations were run from Russia and Ukraine, and were targeting people in Ukraine on multiple platforms and websites. “We took down this operation, blocked their domains from being shared on our platform, and shared information with other tech platforms, researchers and governments,” they said in a blog post. The network in question was relatively minor, with about 4,000 accounts following one page on Facebook, and fewer than 500 following its Instagram accounts. The sites were pushing many of the lines Putin was using to justify the invasion. As we have seen recently with bot activity, they generate realistic-looking profile pictures of people pretending to be journalists and experts. How social media responds Within Russia itself, access to Twitter and Facebook has reportedly been restricted, in part on the basis that Facebook had refused demands to stop factchecking Russian media outlets. Facebook then went a step further with the company’s president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, announcing via tweet that Meta would restrict access to RT and Sputnik in the European Union. TikTok soon followed Facebook’s move. Twitter has not yet gone as far, but announced it would label any link from state-run media as such, stating that the majority of the links to Russian state-run media tend to come from individual accounts, not the accounts associated with the media outlets. The company also tweaked its algorithm so that the links won’t appear in top search results. Google and Facebook announced they would suspend the media companies from being able to monetise on their platforms, while Twitter is pausing ads in Russia and Ukraine. Crypto donations It would be impossible to talk about theway the war is being waged online without discussing the growing role of cryptocurrency. The Ukrainian government’s call for donations in crypto has been loudly heard, with over US$18m flooding into the country in the first few days of the conflict to fund Ukraine armed forces. The country has been accepting donations in Ethereum, bitcoin and Tether. The world’s largest crypto exchange Binance, committed $10m in donations towards Ukraine. In a bid to ensure the western allies’ sanctions against Russia have even more of an impact, Fedorov also called for all major crypto exchanges to block addresses of Russian users. “It’s crucial to freeze not only the addresses linked to Russian and Belarusian politicians, but also to sabotage ordinary users,” he said in a tweet. This call, however, has been met with more reluctance. Binance told CNBC it would suspend individuals on the sanction list, but would not go as far as banning all Russian addresses. “To unilaterally decide to ban people’s access to their crypto would fly in the face of the reason why crypto exists,” the spokesperson said. KuCoin told the outlet it would not do so without a legal requirement, stating it would “impact the rights of innocent people.” Enter Elon Musk It wouldn’t be a major online and news event without Elon Musk, for better or worse, and of course it all played out on Twitter. Fedorov asked for Musk to intervene and provide his satellite Starlink stations to Ukraine. Musk responded quickly that the high-speed internet service was active in the area, and delivered more stations on Monday. Starlink — here. Thanks, @elonmusk pic.twitter.com/dZbaYqWYCf While that has been welcomed by Ukraine, it is worth noting that one Citizen Lab researcher expressed concern that the satellite devices may be used by Russia to track people in Ukraine.

The 39-year-old spent the first 16 years of her career in the construction industry – initially as a quantity surveyor (QS) for a major construction company, then as a QS/estimator for a joinery business. It was a chance encounter while still working full-time as a QS/estimator that set her on a new career path. She got chatting to a National Vocational Qualification assessor, who was there to monitor her apprentice; the assessor made FE sound exciting, mentioning that Leeds college of building was recruiting for new teachers. “At first I thought it seemed too daunting – I had no experience and didn’t know where to start – but she sent me a link about the programme and how to apply to become an FE teacher and it went from there.” Davison joined Leeds college of building in 2017, teaching quantity surveying across programmes in construction and the built environments, and civil engineering, and immediately realised the value in what she was doing. “We are essentially hands-on with shaping the next generation of skilled and professional employees,” she says. “What could be more important?” Like many FE teachers, Davison’s first-hand industry experience has proved invaluable, giving her a wealth of real-life references to help prepare learners for the realities of the working world. “As a teacher, the ability to provide industry-related examples to the students helps to bring the textbooks and theory to life,” she says. “For example, if I am teaching measurement, I am able to relate the practice sessions to something they might be familiar with at work, like internal finishes or excavations. It helps the students visualise the work much more clearly.” Davison’s industry experience gives her real-world references for her students Davison says that one of the biggest surprises of her job has been the fact that she’s constantly learning too. “I want to be the best possible teacher I can, so ensuring continual growth of my own knowledge allows me to impart that knowledge on to the students,” she says. “My background is in building construction as opposed to civil engineering or highways, but the students I teach specialise in a number of different subjects, so I learn from them along the way. They are hugely diverse in terms of their experience and they give me a new perspective.” Davison has been working in FE for five years now, but is as passionate about the construction industry as ever. “I did a survey among my friends where I asked them about working in construction,” she says. “It quickly became apparent that they didn’t realise the number of different jobs available, from quantity surveyors to estimators to architects and planners. Most of them were not aware of all these different roles. They thought of construction as mainly trade operatives rather than skilled professionals. “I also do quite a few events for International Women’s Week. Last year I looked at the experiences of young women in the construction industry, interviewing a number of students to hear what they had to say. I was glad to learn that their experiences, like mine, were largely positive.” Spurred on by her new-found passion for education, the mother of two is now studying for a master’s in construction law and dispute resolution with Leeds Beckett University. “I always wanted to do a master’s but there was never a good time – until now. I tell my students how hard it is to come back to learning after taking a break, but I’m glad I’ve done it,” she says. In 2021, Davison was seconded into a position as the college’s degree apprenticeship development curriculum manager, which she does alongside her FE teaching. She’s clear about the benefits apprenticeships bring to both students and employers. “You can finish an apprenticeship with all the boxes ticked; the experience, the qualification, the knowledge of the systems and also the company values,” she says. “Whereas sometimes with graduates, they have all the textbook knowledge but not that essential experience.” Davison is confident that her decision to share her skills with the next generation was the best career move she’s made. “I like the fact that teaching gave me a different perspective,” she says. “The challenge of it always appeals to me. In my mind, I still get to do what I trained to do but in a different, more exciting way. “It sounds cheesy and people almost roll their eyes when I say it, but I love everything about my job. I just want to be the best I can be for my students.” Your skills are more valuable than you realise.

3/2/2022,"“Further education college was where I grew and developed the most, so I loved the idea that I might give others the opportunity to grow and develop as well,” explains IT pro turned FE lecturer, Daniel Hulatt. Hulatt had always always been interested in computing. “IT offered me a way of expressing myself, of getting my ideas out, so it felt natural to start studying in that area.” His first full-time job was with a financial technology company based in London’s Canary Wharf, working on IT projects for external clients. From there, his next role was on a support desk for a company developing software for the events management market. The work was enjoyable but Hulatt craved more human interaction, which is why, in 2017, he made the decision to move into FE, joining Bedford college as a lecturer while studying for a PGCE. Hulatt says that his real-world experience creates a connection between the classroom and industry School wasn’t always easy for Hulatt. Aged two, he was diagnosed with a rare neurological disorder called idiopathic intracranial hypertension, in which high pressure around the brain causes symptoms such as severe headaches (“imagine putting your head in a vice and it just keeps twisting”), double vision and partial sight loss. Multiple hospital appointments and routine surgery over the years, followed by recovery periods, meant he often missed class. Although the schools he attended made appropriate adjustments and sent work home, the turning point came when he moved to a new school in year 8. “The teachers there were fantastic,” he says. “They took the time to understand and listen, and it went from being a case of struggling to complete work in lessons to wanting to prove [my ability] to myself as much as anything.” When he transferred to an FE college aged 16, his school teachers smoothed the transition by talking to college staff about his needs. He went on to achieve 18 distinctions in his level 3 BTecs. The life experience Hulatt has brought to the job – his disability and his years in the IT industry – has helped him excel as an FE teacher. “It’s very easy to read from slides, it’s very easy to say: ‘This is how the textbook says you do it,’” he says. “But having commercial awareness and the ability to talk about things I’ve done in the real world gives learners a sense of connection between the classroom and industry.” It’s for that reason that Hulatt keeps one foot in the business world, lending his expertise to a small family business, where he helps with its IT setup, and supporting a local archery club with its website and social media. Paula Hobday, head of computing at Bedford college, describes Hulatt as an “exceptional” teacher – and his progression has been swift. Two years into his teaching career, he was promoted from lecturer to course manager, running BTec courses from level 1 to level 3. While teaching, he also studied part-time for a master’s degree in cybersecurity, and in 2021, he won a bronze in the National BTec teacher of the year awards. For Hulatt, it’s not the promotions or awards he’s proudest of though, but his work on the ground with his students. One of the most rewarding parts of his role is supporting them to enter the WorldSkills competition in cybersecurity by running lunchtime groups to help them hone their skills. WorldSkills is a charity committed to raising standards in apprenticeships and technical training, and its competitions give students a chance to showcase their skills. “By bringing in industry experience, I am giving my learners an insight into how the core concepts I’m showing them relate to real-world problems,” he explains. Hulatt says one of the most rewarding parts of his role is giving students a chance to showcase their skills; bottom: a student-designed programmable robot Understandably, Hulatt particularly enjoys working with students who need extra support. “My experiences mean I’m able to empathise with what the students might be experiencing. I’m able to offer solutions from my own toolkit of methods and techniques. It’s really satisfying because you can see the relief when they realise there are solutions that could help,” he says. “Being able to watch them grow in confidence and overcome challenges, and hearing about their progress always brings a bit of pride to the chest.” So what’s next? Hulatt says he would like to continue to broaden his skills and experience, and translate that into his teaching. He also has plans to improve diversity in computing, particularly supporting women, as they are still very much in a minority. And his ambitions beyond that? “I want to continue working closely with local employers, so I can ensure that we are delivering the knowledge and skills to meet industry demand and improve employability options for our students,” he says. “I want Bedford college to be the place of choice if you’re looking to study computing in the local area.” Given what he’s achieved so far, there seems every likelihood he’ll succeed.

3/2/2022,"The International Paralympic Committee confirmed on Wednesday morning that it will allow Russian athletes to compete at the Winter Games which begin in Beijing this week. An emergency meeting of the IPC’s executive committee determined that it would not ban Russia’s 72 athletes, despite the invasion of Ukraine. The team will compete as neutral athletes under the name of the Russian Paralympic Committee (RPC), a sanction that was already in place due to the preceding Russian doping scandal, and their results will not be counted in the medal table. A similar sanction will apply to athletes from Belarus. The decision is compliant with directions given by the International Olympic Committee earlier this week. The IOC called for sporting organisations to ban Russian athletes and officials from sporting events, but said the option of neutrality should remain available for events where it is “not possible on short notice for organisational or legal reasons”. The IPC said it would convene a further meeting to discuss a longer term solution to the issue of members who do not “make compliance with the Olympic Truce”. In a statement, the IPC said: “The RPC and NPC Belarus will participate as neutrals at the Beijing 2022 Paralympic Winter Games. They will compete under the Paralympic flag and not be included in the medal table. “IPC will host an extraordinary General Assembly in 2022 to vote on whether to make compliance with the Olympic Truce a membership requirement and whether to suspend or terminate the membership of the Russian Paralympic Committee and Belarus Paralympic Committee. IPC will not hold any events in Russia or Belarus until further notice.” The president of the IPC, Andrew Parsons, said that the board of the IPC were “greatly concerned” by the invasion of Ukraine and were “in agreement that they cannot go unnoticed or unaddressed”, but that actions were constrained by a constitution which states the IPC remain politically neutral. “Such neutrality is firmly anchored in the genuine belief that sport holds the transformative power to overcome our shortcomings, and summon from within us the best of our humanity, especially in the darkest of moments,” Parsons said. “Now that this decision has been made, I expect all participating NPCs to treat the neutral athletes as they would any other athletes at these Games, no matter how difficult this may be. Unlike their respective governments, these Paralympic athletes and officials are not the aggressors, they are here to compete in a sport event like everybody else.”",Sport/Sport,Russians get green light to compete as neutral athletes at Winter Paralympics,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/02/russians-get-green-light-to-compete-as-neutral-athletes-at-winter-paralympics
3/2/2022,"Mehnaz Ibrahim-Khan is always on the go. When the 34-year-old isn’t looking after her four children, aged one to 10, she’s at one of her two part-time jobs. “As a parent, I am very used to multitasking and switching from one thing to the next,” she says. “The trick is to be as organised as possible and plan ahead.” After studying for a degree in business management, Ibrahim-Khan got a job as a junior accounts receivable administrator at a security firm. Fast-forward 10 years, and she’s worked her way up to a multifaceted role working across multiple departments. “As it’s a small business, I’m expected to wear different hats all the time and adapt my skillset as the business grows,” she says. “I now manage the whole accounts department, overseeing accounts receivable and accounts payable, along with liaising with our accountants. I’m also in charge of HR and payroll, and assist on the marketing and sales side of things too.” Ibrahim-Khan’s first experience of further education (FE) was as a vocational student, and she relished the fact her teachers were also experts in their field. “What sets FE apart from school is that you are typically taught by industry professionals – people who have first-hand experience, skills and knowledge in the field their students have chosen to study. It’s more practical in that sense, whereas in other settings teaching can be very textbook and theoretical.” It’s therefore no surprise that after 10 years in industry, she decided to make more of what she knows by sharing her skills with FE learners. Like 46% of FE staff working at colleges, Ibrahim-Khan lectures part-time – in her case alongside her industry job, something she believes gives her an important edge. “I love the fact I can use my knowledge and expertise in my teaching role to help give my students an insight into the working world,” she says. “I think that practical experience is invaluable for me and for them.” Although you don’t need any specialist qualifications to start teaching in FE, Ibrahim-Khan began her journey by studying for a PGCE part-time, alongside her part-time job at the security firm and her family duties. At times when her plate felt the fullest, she reminded herself who she was working so hard for. “My main motivation is that I want to be a good role model to my children,” she says. “My eldest daughter has a little classroom in her bedroom with a whiteboard and imaginary students. She wants to be a teacher too. I love the fact I can be someone for her to look up to.” Her hard work has paid off. She impressed her tutor so much that they referred her to the business department of Nescot (North East Surrey College of Technology), where she was offered a position as a sessional teacher in September 2019. Then, in January 2020, she was made a permanent member of staff. This year, she’s teaching units in promoting and financing an enterprise idea, and personal and business finance. She also became the centre lead for the Young Enterprise scheme. “My level 3, year 2 students’ enterprise, ‘Scion’, won the overall company of the year prize and the best e-advert prize,” she says proudly. “Being part of the whole learning process, watching them develop their skills, and having the opportunity to inspire their thinking, is the reason why I got into teaching. It’s just such an honour to make a positive difference and be that positive role model that might be missing in their lives.” In her industry job, Ibrahim-Khan is in charge of her company’s accounts department, HR and payroll For Ibrahim-Khan, one of the greatest joys of working in FE is the chance to support her learners and impart life skills as they prepare to leave the world of education and enter the workforce. “By the time children leave school at 16 they are able to work, so at the very least they should be able to understand how a wage slip works,” she says. “My students have chosen to study finance, so they are already invested in the first step of their career, but some of them, for example, didn’t realise they would have to pay back an interest-free overdraft or understand how their payslip is broken down. I love it when I see that lightbulb go on and that they suddenly get it.” In fact, in many ways, she sees her young learners as an extension of her family. “I’ve always been like an agony aunt to my nieces and nephews and I love the fact I’m able to nurture my students too,” she says. “Some of my first cohort of students have never sat an exam because their GCSEs were graded [because of Covid], so they are now about to sit their first finance exams and are understandably nervous. As teachers, we’ve all had to adapt to make it as easy as possible for them.” Two-and-a-half years into her life as a dual professional, Ibrahim-Khan has no regrets. “I love that teaching in FE allows flexibility, which other education settings may not be able to offer,” she says. “Although teaching is a whole different ball game in comparison to accounting, teaching in FE brings the two together in an inspirational way. I love that I get to use my skills and experiences from one industry to inform the other, and no two days are the same. I’m blessed to be able to have the best of both worlds.” Your skills are more valuable than you realise.

3/2/2022,"On 22 February, the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, and state attorney general, Ken Paxton, released guidance to the state’s child protection services (CPS) classifying the provision of gender-affirming care to transgender adolescents as child abuse. The guidance threatened criminal penalties for licensed professionals, such as doctors, nurses and teachers, who fail to report suspicions of such “abuse” to the state. The policy’s implementation would also mean potentially removing trans kids from supportive parents and putting them in the state’s foster system. Considered the standard of care for transgender youth by the major medical associations in the US, gender-affirming care can include medical interventions such as puberty blockers and hormone replacement therapies. (US medical guidelines do not recommend genital surgeries for youth under 18.) Issuance of the guidance follows unsuccessful efforts by the Texas state legislature to enact a ban on gender-affirming care for youth. Both Abbott and Paxton are up for re-election. The move by the Texas executive branch is not legally binding, and by Friday, district attorneys in Texas’s five largest counties had said they would not enforce it. But the state has already begun investigating the parents of some transgender children, according to a lawsuit filed on Tuesday by the ACLU. The suit, which seeks to block the guidance from being enforced, alleges that an employee of Texas’s department of family and protective services was suspended from her job on 23 February and has since been told that she is under investigation to determine whether she and her husband “committed abuse by affirming their transgender daughter’s identity and obtaining the medically necessary health care that she needs”. Dr Megan Mooney, a licensed psychologist based in Houston who has worked with trans youth for the past 15 years, is also a named plaintiff in the ACLU suit, which argues that complying with Abbott’s order would require “violating her professional standards of ethics and inflict serious harm and trauma on her clients”. The suit also notes that Mooney could “face prison time for making a report of child abuse when she knows child abuse is not happening”. The Guardian spoke with Mooney on 25 February, before the lawsuit was filed, about the immediate fallout from Abbott’s announcement. What was your reaction to the release of the ‘child abuse’ guidance? I wish I could say I was surprised, but I wasn’t. I’m part of a working group here in Texas that focuses on LGBTQ youth and foster care specifically, and we’ve known that [Paxton has] been working on this opinion for a number of months. So I wasn’t surprised, but nonetheless, it felt like a gut punch. The language is so inflammatory and so hurtful and so factually incorrect. Both [Paxton and Abbot] are quite desperate to be re-elected at this point. It is unfortunate that they are choosing to do so at the expense of children. The order is not legally blinding, according to legal experts. But how do you expect it to shake up the system? What I have seen in the past 48 hours or so is just absolute panic among mental health groups about what to do, because those of us who work alongside physicians supporting youth and their families are of course mandated reporters. People are asking, “Do I have to report children and families and physicians that I know are doing good work? Or am I going to potentially be in violation of state laws and lose my license?” I have spent a good chunk of the past 48 hours trying to get information out through social media and all of the therapist groups I’m part of. We’re saying, “No, this is not legally binding. You don’t have to do anything different.” In addition to that, children and families are absolutely panicked. I’ve been fielding questions from my clients and their parents about, “Do I need to prepare to move out of state? Do I need to get an attorney? What do I need to do if CPS comes to my door?” The notices have such inflammatory language and sound like they’re enforceable, so citizens of Texas are worried about being reported for child abuse when it’s just not necessary. What has your advice been to your clients? It has broadly been to stay calm. This doesn’t mean anything. I’m not reporting you, nobody is reporting you, and there are huge groups of people planning to support you and take care of you as always here in the state of Texas and elsewhere. There’s lots of people, even in the conservative Texas legislature, protecting your fundamental rights. That’s an important part that, therapeutically, I’m trying to have people focus on. It’s so important in stressful and traumatic times to be able to have a sense of hope and optimism. Can you speak to what gender-affirming care looks like for youth of varying ages? At its core, it’s believing children. That is the purest essence of gender-affirming care. When a child tells you who they are, you believe them, which is really no different from any of the rest of our therapy. When children tell us they’re anxious, we believe them. When children tell us they have problems focusing, we believe them. If a child tells me, “Hey, some doctor got it wrong when I was born and this isn’t who I am,” I believe them. In addition to that, it’s supporting their journey and figuring out this particular label or identity, or outward expression means for them and for their family and how to support them in the best way to encourage positive mental health and wellbeing, social development, but also focusing on things – in Texas, unfortunately – like safety. Thinking about how we help [trans youth] have a safe path forward in school, sharing the guidance from their legal resources in Texas and outside Texas, so families and students know what their rights are. And getting them connected with appropriate qualified and affirming medical professionals as well, so that they can get really good treatment if, and when that’s a part of their journey. At what age might medical interventions actually happen for adolescents? This is a highly individualized discussion and decision made with children and parents. We really are looking at whether that is something that will help them to have better mental health and physical wellbeing. The conversation is always, “What are their individual goals?” This makes my trans and non-binary kids no different from all the rest of my clients. So if part of their goals are to reduce secondary sex characteristics that [their bodies] naturally produce through puberty, then I give parents lots of resources, lots of research that shows them the positive mental health benefits of this treatment and what to expect from the treatments. After that I send them to at least have consultations with physicians. Have a conversation with a medical physician who can tell you about the impacts on your child’s body. You do not have to commit to anything at a first appointment with them or me for that matter, but just go get good information so you’re not Google searching HRT for kids and getting nonsense. What is your experience with patients who have gone through pubertal suppression? One hundred per cent positive. Not a one had a negative reaction physically or regarding mental health. That’s something that I can say, with all honesty. I have only seen positive impacts on children, either for pubertal suppression or for beginning hormone therapy as well. One thing that I’ve run into is people who say, ‘We shouldn’t affirm a mental illness.’ And one of the points that I make is that affirming goes both ways. So if a child who was assigned male at birth says, ‘I feel like a girl’ and they feel that way for a year, you affirm that. And then if all of a sudden they say, ‘No, I thought about it and I’m actually a boy,’ you affirm that way also. Is there a misperception that when people hear about a gender-affirming approach, they assume that it’s trying to ram a transgender identity down the child’s throat? We don’t question cisgender children that they know their identity. We only seem to do this with our trans and non-binary kids. So why do we assume that cis kids know their gender and trans kids don’t? That questioning shows a real bias in people’s heart. What data tells us is that kids know their gender from very early ages – three, four, and five. Since the 1960s, research has told us children consistently can distinguish between – if we’re assuming a binary – male and female, in pointing at others and identifying themselves. So why do we think all of a sudden these children don’t understand the concept of gender or can’t label their own gender? Why do you think there is so much opposition to gender-affirming care for minors? At its core, it’s just a lack of understanding. People have these preconceived notions that therapists are turning kids trans, or that it’s just a fad, it’s just a phase, this is just something because of the internet or whatever. But this isn’t new. Through art and literature and historical information, we know that trans and non-binary people have existed for thousands of years. In many other cultures that are not bound by conservative western Christian views, people are revered and as seen as higher than and better than those of us who are cisgender people. What the internet has done is allowed children to find others like them, to give language and voice, and to know that they’re not alone. That is an incredibly valuable message for them to receive for their mental health. Circling back to Texas, you’re telling your patients not to panic at this point. Is there a point in this process where you would suggest panicking or making moves to leave the state? One of the really interesting pieces of advice I heard this week was [to work on] “safe folders” – letters and testimonials from physicians, mental health professionals, neighbors, spiritual leaders saying this parent is not harming their child and that their child is better off for the care they receive. So if somebody from CPS shows up at their door, that’s ready to go. If parents are looking for an action item to do right now to protect themselves, that is the conversation I am having [with my clients] this week. If a bill passes through our legislature that somehow encodes gender-affirming care as actual child abuse, that is also a point at which I will be much more concerned for families here in Texas. I think that the problem, though, in your question, is that most families don’t have the resources to pick up and move. So finding ways for families to stay safe without uprooting their lives is another area we’ve got to focus on. I will, in the meantime, continue to be doing the work that I do – collaborating with case workers and CPS investigators and educators and the general public so that people really understand that gender-affirming care is medically necessary care and is life-saving care and is most certainly not abuse.

3/2/2022,"“Maybe fathers could explain sons?” wonders Achike, an actor in his late 30s with a film career on the ascendant yet a nagging sense of incompleteness. His childhood friend Ekene experiences manhood as a burden: “Why do I have to be this hard, painful thing? … Why can’t I be somebody’s boy?” Okechukwu Nzelu’s second novel, Here Again Now, begins with these two gay British-Nigerian men, then traces back to their fathers and their fathers before them, as well as a father figure, uncle and stepdad – variously disciplinarian, drunk, unavailable, absent, abusive and repressed. It’s a story made from broken family tree branches. Achike has recently travelled to Nigeria to play dual roles in a movie set across two lifetimes. The script, titled Here Again Now, is based on an Igbo belief system in which humans are reincarnated into the same family line – in other words, set up for second chances. Having returned to south London, Achike lets both his alcoholic father Chibuike and jobless Ekene move in with him. Achike and Ekene have the same “long, clever fingers”, and were the only boys with Igbo names in their class in Manchester. But Achike can now afford a flat, expensive cologne and therapy sessions, whereas Ekene has abandoned his own dreams of acting and is struggling to get work as a teacher. Ekene can be blithe to the edge of cruelty. Achike is more disciplined, gallant, painfully earnest, prone to migraines. As much brothers as lovers, their mutual desire has gone mostly unconsummated. As Chibuike observes: “When Ekene was around, Achike was always something short of waiting.” The pair’s protracted conversations about their relationship status swerve into talk of their ambivalence towards both England and Nigeria. “They hate us there,” Ekene says of the latter, though both long to forge a connection to the land and its history. Meanwhile, Chibuike disapproves of the focus on “primitive” African myth in the film poised to make his son a star. The novel goes on to slip between time periods in a worthwhile exploration of diaspora and Black gay masculinity. But by the time the reader encounters Achike’s comment that being in therapy “feels like hard work”, the same impression hovers around the book’s structure and style. Exposition can be workmanlike, dialogue laboured, the omniscient narration overcooked. Each character so actively processes their own masculinity they’re less believable as individuals than as overlapping strands of one psyche – “more ideas than men”, as it’s put towards the end. From its title, Here Again Now is clearly about recurrence, but Nzelu’s use of repetition can be jarring. Sentences are recycled over and again. Some phrases make abrupt U-turns (“Achike has noticed this, too, without noticing”). At its best, the use of such techniques can achieve propulsiveness. A similar narrative device can be found in the repetitive, expository vocal scores used in contemporary Nigerian cinema, a style that the musicologist Emaeyak Peter Sylvanus has called “prefiguring”. Take Nzelu’s description of gentrified Peckham: “A few streets away in one direction, people were selling plantain. A few streets away in another direction, people were selling plantain at twice the price.” But the constant verbal rehashing threatens to send the novel in circles. When concepts such as “Could there only be distance and sex between men?” come up some half a dozen times, it seems that subtext has overwhelmed storytelling. Love is mentioned overtly and often, treated as an absolute that slips in and out of grasp, what the philosopher Alain Badiou has called a “tenacious adventure”. Badiou wrote: “Real love is one that triumphs lastingly, sometimes painfully, over the hurdles erected by time, space and the world.” In Here Again Now, Nzelu brings verve and radiant detail while still mastering the skills to construct a high-stakes obstacle course.

3/2/2022,"Sinéad Browne has always had a complicated relationship with food. At the age of 16, she was living in a B&B in south London after leaving the care system, waiting for the jobcentre to process her benefits claim – which meant she had no money. Sometimes she managed to get by with the help of friends, but occasionally went days without anything to eat. “The benefits I applied for didn’t come through for about eight weeks,” says Browne, 32. “During that time, I didn’t have a penny to my name, I didn’t have a social worker, I didn’t have anything. And I was hungry. It was terrifying.” Browne would travel miles to friends’ houses for meals but was too embarrassed to confide in them. “I wouldn’t go more than a few times a week, as I didn’t want to be laughed at or for them to realise I was in need.” Things got so desperate that she considered shoplifting from a supermarket but instead told the security guard her plight. He took pity on her and gave her a lunchtime meal deal on offer in the store. Browne was first placed in care when she was two because her family home was deemed unsafe. For 14 years, she moved between more than 15 different children’s homes and temporary foster placements until she was placed in the B&B. After a few months, she was moved again, to a self-contained flat in a homeless hostel, where she studied for her GCSEs and A-levels. “It gave me a safe space and passing my A-levels meant that I could secure a scholarship to university,” she says. She defied expectations by enrolling at the University of Surrey, where she graduated with a law degree. Higher education is unusual among care leavers: a study conducted by the Rees Centre at the University of Oxford found that only 13% of care-leavers in England had entered higher education, compared with 49% of the general population. In 2019, the Centre for Social Justice think-tank found that care-leavers in the UK are “more likely to end up in a prison cell than a lecture theatre”. In her 20s, Browne could afford food but regularly deprived herself because she had developed bulimia and body dysmorphia. At the age of 14, she was hospitalised because her weight was so low, after which she attended group therapy at a day centre. She now manages her illness, but says she will never fully recover. “You are always in recovery, even if the disordered eating behaviour isn’t active. You often have the thoughts. You find healthier coping mechanisms but, in times of extreme stress, I still have relapses.” Browne already had an interest in sustainability and food waste, but it was only after a backpacking trip around New Zealand, aged 28, that she decided to give up her career as a solicitor to tackle food poverty and waste in her south London community full-time. During her travels, a backpacker friend brought “some amazing food” back to their youth hostel. Knowing he had very little money, she asked where he had got it and discovered he had been to Free Store, a food redistribution charity in Wellington. Browne was so impressed with the charity that she volunteered. She knew that if she had been able to go somewhere like Free Store when she couldn’t afford food, she wouldn’t have had to go hungry. In 2018, after returning from New Zealand, Browne started Compliments of the House – the name is deliberately chosen to remove the stigma from food aid, the idea being that the food is to be enjoyed in a welcoming communal space. The charity is funded by donations from the public, corporate donors, trusts and grants, and operates according to the same model as Free Store, offering surplus food from commercial eateries to people in need. It has helped more than 1,000 people since June last year. Charities such as Free Store and Compliments of the House are very much in demand. According to the international charity Action Against Hunger, more than 810 million people in the world experience hunger every day, yet 900m tonnes of food is wasted annually – a third of total global food. According to the United Nations, the production and rotting of this food also leaves behind a carbon footprint so large it is only topped by those of the US and China. In the UK, 9.5m tonnes of food is wasted each year. Most comes from households, while 500,000 tonnes is left uneaten in restaurants, pubs, fast food outlets, hotels and other outlets. That is equivalent to more than 1bn meals. Lockdown saw a reduction in food waste as restaurants closed and households had time to plan meals and preserve food in bulk, but it has started to rise again. In 2020, the issue of food poverty was highlighted by the Manchester United footballer, Marcus Rashford MBE, who embarrassed the government into a series of U-turns over the extension of free school meals. A leading food bank charity, the Trussell Trust, said it distributed a record 2.5m food parcels during the first year of the pandemic, while other charities, schools and councils also handed out an unprecedented amount of food aid. The Food Foundation reported that, by January last year, 9% of the population had experienced food insecurity – defined as skipping meals, going hungry or not eating for a whole day. “People like Marcus Rashford and the Trussell Trust have done an amazing job of highlighting the issue of hidden hunger,” says Browne. “I think the pandemic, in a short space of time, created a microcosm of people who became dependent [on food charities] because of a change in circumstances.” Browne believes the pandemic also showed that food poverty can happen to anyone, including people from better-off backgrounds. Compliments of the House has welcomed a number of freelance workers and self-employed people who had difficulty getting government grants at the height of the pandemic, as well as homeowners struggling to pay the mortgage after losing their jobs. Browne’s charity differs from some traditional food banks in several ways. Service users are known as guests, and the principle behind it is to offer a hand-up – not handouts. Guests are not required to jump through bureaucratic hoops to prove need, there are no humiliating queues or invasive questionnaires and the food is all nutritious (they also cater for a range of dietary requirements). Typically, service users at food banks are given canned goods, dried pasta, rice and cereals because they are relatively cheap and have a long shelf-life; these are also the items most people donate. However, as Browne knows from experience, homeless people and those with precarious living arrangements do not necessarily have access to cooking facilities. “In my hostel, there was no microwave. No kettle. Nothing. I could never cook for myself. Something like Compliments of the House would have been a lifesaver for me.” She also points out that people with learning difficulties or physical disabilities may struggle to cook without support. “At Compliments of the House, they get food that is already prepared, that would otherwise go to waste.” Guests are invited to eat on-site at the hub and enjoy the “restaurant experience”, or take their meals home. All the food at the hub comes from well-known chain restaurants such as Franco Manca and Honest Burger, or takeaways spots, such as Greggs. There is also surplus food from Brixton market. “We collect from 40 different places and put the food out on shelves,” says Browne. There are three shelves at the hub: starters on the top, main courses in the middle and desserts at the bottom. “Guests are allowed to pick three [items] from the top shelf, two or four from the middle shelf, then from the bottom.” Lockdown meant that Compliments of the House was forced to close its communal hub, while many of the outlets that donated food had to close, too. “As a small, grassroots charity, we haven’t been able to afford commercial rent, which has left us vulnerable to landlords’ whims,” says Browne. They changed the nature of the operation, moving from a restaurant experience to a delivery service. The team occupied a community centre, packing and delivering food sourced from cafes and supermarkets and Browne’s efforts earned her a Points of Light award from Downing Street. Before the Brixton hub was closed, Compliments of the House also helped guests to find pathways into employment with its Back to Work scheme. Guests were trained at the charity’s office in basic administration skills andcould also volunteer at the hub itself, gaining experience in hospitality. “Eventually, we trained them to a level where they could run the hub as a manager. We provided them with their level 2 food safety training, which meant that, after three months, we could present them to one of the businesses who had agreed to be part of our Back to Work scheme,” says Browne. Although she is supported by conscientious staff, the organisation devours almost all her time. But it is worth it, she says: “I’ve had such a varied relationship with food that it’s always beautiful now that I can make sure food doesn’t go to waste.” Browne is about to open a new hub in Brixton and plans additional hubs in Hackney and Leeds this year. Then she hopes to approach life at a steadier pace, and dreams of eventually moving to the countryside to grow vegetables and rescue animals. She is joining the National Fostering Agency as a youth ambassador, and would like to foster children with her partner one day. “Growing up in the care system, I was moved around so much – there was a lot of instability,” she says. “It meant I couldn’t have a family. Now, fostering children is one of my biggest goals.”",News/Society,‘I was hungry - and it was terrifying’: How Sinéad Browne overcame the odds and set up her own food charity,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/02/i-was-hungry-and-it-was-terrifying-how-sinead-browne-overcame-the-odds-and-set-up-her-own-food-charity
