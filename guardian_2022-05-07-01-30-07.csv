5/7/2022,"Shortly before the 2020 election, Donald Trump’s national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, “stunned” the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff by saying the president wanted to kill a senior Iranian military officer operating outside the Islamic Republic. “This was a really bad idea with very big consequences,” Mark Esper, Trump’s second and last secretary of defense, writes in his new memoir, adding that Gen Mark Milley suspected O’Brien saw the strike purely in terms of Trump’s political interests. A Sacred Oath: Memoirs of a Defense Secretary in Extraordinary Times will be published next week. The Guardian obtained a copy. Throughout the memoir, Esper presents himself as one of a group of aides who resisted bad or illegal ideas proposed by Trump or subordinates – such as the proposed strike on the Iranian officer. Among other such ideas that were discussed, Esper says, were sending “missiles into Mexico to destroy the drug labs”; sending 250,000 troops to the southern border; and dipping the decapitated head of a terrorist leader in pig’s blood as a warning to other Islamist militants. Trump made belligerence towards Tehran an important part of his administration and platform for re-election, pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and regularly warning in bombastic terms of the cost of conflict with the US. He also ordered a drone strike on a top Iranian general blamed for attacks on US targets. In January 2020, Qassem Suleimani, the head of the elite Quds force, was killed in Baghdad. At a meeting in July 2020, Esper writes, O’Brien pushed for military action against Iran over its uranium enrichment – work that accelerated after Trump pulled out of the nuclear deal. Esper’s book is subject to occasional redactions. In this case, it says “O’Brien was pushing for” one blacked out word “and military action”. Esper says the vice-president, Mike Pence, “subtly lean[ed] in behind” O’Brien, who said: “The president has an appetite to do something.” Esper writes that Mark Meadows, Trump’s chief of staff, “jumped in to contradict this statement” and the moment passed. However, a month or so later, on 20 August, Esper says Milley told him O’Brien had called the evening before, to say “the president wanted to strike a senior military officer who was operating outside of Iran”. Esper writes: “Milley and I were aware of this person and the trouble he had been stirring in the region for some time. But why now? What was new? Was there an imminent threat? What about gathering the national security team to discuss this? “Milley said he was ‘stunned’ by the call, and he sensed that ‘O’Brien put the president up to this,’ trying to create news that would help Trump’s re-election.” Milley, Esper writes, told O’Brien he would discuss the request with Esper and others. “I couldn’t believe it,” Esper writes. “I had seen this movie before, where White House aides meet with the president, stir him up, and then serve up one of their ‘great ideas’. But this was a really bad idea with very big consequences. How come folks in the White House didn’t see this?” Fears that Trump might provoke war with Iran persisted throughout his presidency, stoked by reports of machinations among hawks on his staff. Such fears intensified as the 2020 election approached and Trump trailed Joe Biden in the polls. In September 2020, Trump tweeted: ““Any attack by Iran, in any form, against the United States will be met with an attack on Iran that will be 1,000 times greater in magnitude!” In the case of O’Brien’s suggested strike on the Iranian officer, Esper writes that he told Milley he would do nothing without a written order from Trump. “There was no way I was going to unilaterally take such an action,” he writes, “particularly one fraught with a range of legal, diplomatic, political and military implications, not to mention that it could plunge us into war with Iran.” He also says the O’Brien call to Milley in late August was “the last time something involving Iran seriously came up before the election”.",Arts/Books,Trump sought strike on top Iran military figure for political reasons – Esper book,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/may/06/trump-proposal-iranian-military-figure-book-mark-esper
5/7/2022,"The world’s most polluting companies have a moral and legal obligation to address the harms of climate change because of their role in spreading misinformation, according to a major inquiry sparked by Filipino typhoon survivors. Experts say the long-awaited report published on Friday, which concludes that coal, oil, mining and cement firms engaged in “wilful obfuscation” of climate science and obstructed efforts towards a global transition to clean energy, could add fuel to climate lawsuits around the world. The inquiry by the Philippines Commission on Human Rights began seven years ago after a petition by survivors of devastating Typhoon Haiyan, and local NGOs. As well as considering the human rights impacts of climate breakdown in the Philippines, it drew on scientific, legal and personal evidence from around the world to examine the role played by 47 of the world’s most polluting companies in the climate crisis. During hearings in Manila, London and New York the commission heard from survivors of devastating extreme weather disasters who appealed directly to the companies to respect their human rights. It concluded that the world’s most polluting companies are morally and legally liable for the impacts of the climate crisis because they engaged in wilful obfuscation of climate science and obstructed efforts towards a global transition to clean energy. And it said they may also be held to account by their shareholders for continuing to invest in oil exploration for “largely speculative purposes”. The commission also called on governments around the world to phase out existing fossil fuel projects and keep new coal, oil and gas in the ground, provide incentives for renewable energy, and to ensure businesses are subject to strong corporate responsibility laws. Yeb Saño, executive director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia, which helped bring the original petition, said the report was a “vindication” for the millions of people whose rights are being breached by the companies behind the climate crisis. “This report is historic and sets a solid legal basis for asserting that climate-destructive business activities by fossil fuel and cement companies contribute to human rights harms. The message is clear: these corporate behemoths cannot continue to transgress human rights and put profit before people and planet.” While the commission does not have the power to hold the companies legally responsible or to fine them, experts hope the report will inform the development of new laws and lawsuits in the Philippines, and the vast body of evidence it has collected will be used by policymakers, lawyers and climate campaigners around the world. Carroll Muffett, president and CEO of the US-based Center for International Environmental Law, described the result as a watershed moment in climate accountability that builds on other recent court lawsuits, such as last year’s ruling by a Dutch court that Shell had to cut its emissions by 45% by 2030. He added that the commission’s conclusion that states are responsible for protecting their citizens from climate-related human rights abuses by businesses “should send shockwaves through the oil industry”. Chair Roberto Eugenio Cadiz said the commission provided “every opportunity” to allow the companies under investigation to participate in the inquiry, even travelling to countries where many of the firms had their headquarters, but none took up the offer. However, several did challenge the commission’s jurisdiction over them in writing and argued that climate change was not a violation of human rights. Publication of the report was repeatedly delayed, to the growing frustration of the petitioners, many of whom were also affected by the more recent Typhoon Rai, but they are glad it has finally come out. Saño said the commission set a “courageous example” for other human rights institutions and governments around the world and called on the incoming Philippine government to adopt its findings.",News/World news,Filipino inquiry finds big polluters ‘morally and legally liable’ for climate damage,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/06/filipino-inquiry-finds-big-polluters-morally-and-legally-liable-for-climate-damage

5/7/2022,"The pressure is growing for Rishi Sunak – the question is when will he crack? After the Bank of England warned the economy was heading for a recession caused by the cost of living crisis, with inflation set to top 10% by the autumn, demands on the chancellor for a fresh package of emergency support for struggling families have reached a crescendo. Threadneedle Street forecasts the second-biggest income squeeze since modern records began in 1964, with inflation racing to the highest level since the 1980s. So far, Sunak has shown reluctance to act. Despite the bleak outlook, the view from No 11 is that time is on the government’s side for two key reasons. First, lower energy use over the summer could take some of the sting out of last month’s record 54% rise in the Ofgem price cap. The current limit applies until October, buying him some time. Treasury sources said Sunak is keen to wait and see how volatile wholesale prices progress between now and August when the energy regulator announces its next cap period from October. Second, the chancellor is keen to talk up the current £22bn in support for this financial year, including in his spring statement and energy rebate package. All told, the Office for Budget Responsibility reckons half the blow to household finances is covered and a third of the overall hit to living standards. However, the economic outlook is only getting worse. We are already halfway through Ofgem’s six-month monitoring period for wholesale energy prices used to inform the October price cap and the picture is clear. Gas prices may have fallen back in recent weeks but remain elevated. The Bank expects bills to go up by 40% to about £2,800. On top of the April rise that is an eye-watering hit for families with winter approaching. Observers say Sunak is most likely to announce further support in August when Ofgem announces its new cap. This could include ramping up the repayable loan to cover bills due in that month, or increasing the warm homes dscount open to low-income households. That may not be enough. A steady stream of negative economic updates is in the post and pressure is mounting for a mini-budget before then. Official figures this month are likely to show inflation reached 9% in April, the highest level for 40 years. Consumer confidence has collapsed, while monthly retail sales have tumbled. Sunak has argued he can’t do everything, though after the billions of pounds deployed during the Covid pandemic the argument is paper thin. It also neglects that different choices could have been made to help poorer families, rather than middle and higher-earners, within the same overall spending envelope. Top of the bill would be to raise the value of benefits. Viewed as the most powerful way to help the poorest households, economists say Sunak could bring forward a 7.5% rise for pensions and benefits due in April 2023. Dave Innes, the head of economics at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that with inflation heading to 10%, compared with benefits that rose by just 3% in April, that the poorest in society are facing the biggest real-terms cut to benefits in 50 years. Making up for the gap could cost about £15bn, according to the Resolution Foundation. “Clearly that is placing a huge strain on people’s financial position who were most vulnerable going into the cost of living crisis and that’s an unacceptable situation,” Innes said. Sunak has warned that further state support could risk adding to inflation, but that is a disingenuous position. The Bank reckons four-fifths of the inflation shock comes from outside the UK. The Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, warned on Thursday that the poorest families, and workers in the weakest position to bargain for higher wages, would pay the heaviest price. The impact of Covid and the war in Ukraine are the primary drivers of inflation, not public spending and benefit claimants. James Smith, the research director at the Resolution Foundation, said that action to raise benefits was the best tool for the job, when the poorest 10% of households spend double as a share of their income on essentials like energy, fuel and food than those in the top 10%. “There’s a choice that can be made about who is supported,” he said. Leading business groups are increasingly worried the lack of action could lay the conditions for a recession. Company bosses are likely to take matters into their own hands in the coming weeks, as they suffer their own energy crisis; on top of tax hikes, staff shortages, Brexit disruption and supply chain issues. Jobs and investment could suffer. After weeks of scandal, Sunak’s battered public image may be at rock bottom, but a less-than-awful Conservative local election round might help the chancellor’s case for biding his time. However, with families increasingly suffering, and the economy on a slippery slope, every day without action will make for a more challenging period ahead.",News/Business,What will Rishi Sunak do about the cost of living crisis?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/06/rishi-sunak-cost-of-living-crisis-uk-recession

5/7/2022,"On days like these, every prime minister needs his useful idiots. The morning after the local elections is a time for twattery as all parties try to make sense of the results and give them the best possible spin, so any sensible MP makes sure to steer clear of the airwaves. Unless, like the unknown – even to himself – Tory MP for Ruislip, David Simmonds, you’re using the opportunity to call for your leader to go over Partygate. Though once he’d sensed his was a lone voice and that others were biding their time for now, he rather rowed back. He just wanted Boris Johnson to rethink his priorities. Of course he did. So brave. We won’t be hearing from him again. But the Convict could be grateful for Robert Jenrick and Oliver Dowden, who toured the studios as a double act, Dumb and Dumber, giving a second-rate impersonation of what they imagined to be the authentic, official voice of Her Majesty’s government. Jenrick isn’t even in the cabinet. He had been, of course, but Johnson had realised he was too rubbish even to make it into his cabinet of the talentless. Imagine being that crap. But Jenrick isn’t one to let his no-mark status bother him, in that he’s the heir apparent to the needy Matt Hancock, so he’ll do or say anything to curry favour with the boss class. So Jenrick’s take on the results was unsurprisingly chipper. Everything was going wholly to plan. Couldn’t see what the fuss was. The Tories might have been in meltdown in London, but elsewhere everything was just tickety-boo, all things considered. Which, of course, he hadn’t considered. He was also happy to relate that he had been shopping at the 24-hour Asda in Newark at 5am. The Asda later confirmed it wasn’t open round the clock and that any shoppers turning up in the middle of the night would have to come armed with a jemmy, ready to break in. So where Honest Bob had been at 5am was anyone’s guess. Dowden has ample form on the moron-meter. Back in the day, before he became an MP, he worked in David Cameron’s planning unit, where his most telling contribution was to admit he had been taken by surprise by unforeseen events. He had one job … But as co-chair of the Tory party, and being more or less responsible for the Conservatives’ election campaign, he was rather obliged to front up the results. Some councils had been challenging, he said, but it wasn’t looking as if Labour had done enough to win a general election. On the Today programme, Nick Robinson was for once reduced to silence. He hadn’t realised it was the job of the Tories to run Labour’s campaign. On LBC, Nick Ferrari asked Dowden what had gone wrong and what had come up on the doorstep for Tory canvassers. Dumber ummed and aahed. No one had mentioned parties. Not one. Amazing, that. Though if they had done, it would have been to ask why they hadn’t been invited. No, what had come up most was the sheer abundance of new Brexit opportunities. Why, only the previous day the UK had relaxed its red tape so we could import radioactive vegetables from Fukushima. Don’t remember that on the Vote Leave bus. Still, none of this was quite so catatonically stupid as the unnamed Tory source who told one reporter that it was just as well the Conservatives had been wiped out in London, as the rest of the country couldn’t stand snooty metropolitan elites. Brilliant. The way to win elections is to lose them. Dialectical stupidism. Plus it’s a top look to appear totally unaware that London is home to some of the most deprived communities in the country. Just before lunch, the Convict came out of hiding, looking as if he had been dragged through a local park. He’s looking beyond rough these days. An insult not just to himself but the entire country. He, too, conceded that some results hadn’t gone entirely to plan, but that overall he was ecstatic about the situation. Everything pointed to voters recognising that the Tories were getting on with governing and had got all the big calls right. God knows what deep shit we’d be in if they’d got them wrong. Inflation at 10%, energy prices rocketing, a cost of living crisis and taxes and interest rates rising. Yesterday’s Bank of England forecast terrified most economists. Johnson seems to take it as a ray of sunshine. While Momentum chose to rubbish Labour’s results – “What do we want? More antisemitism” – Keir Starmer turned up in north London to celebrate the victory in Barnet, as well as those in Wandsworth, Wimbledon, Cumberland and Southampton. “This is a big turning point,” he said, as he tried to lead his supporters in a triumphant rally. But it all felt a little awkward. Starmer is not a natural demagogue. Which made it all the more ironic that later in the day, Durham constabulary announced that it was going to reinvestigate Beergate. Someone less likely to have knowingly broken the rules, it’s hard to imagine. And if he does get fined, he’d probably feel obliged to do the honourable thing and resign. Unlike the Convict, who’d still deny any wrongdoing even if he was caught waist-deep in cocaine, tequila shots and fixed-penalty notices. The real takeaway from the results was that the Tories had done badly and Labour hadn’t done as well as they hoped. But neither party could bring themselves to admit that. Still, the Lib Dems and the Greens had probably exceeded their expectations. And if the most likely extrapolation was that Labour was heading for a minority government with the Lib Dems, then most of us could settle for that. It was better than most might have expected when the Convict won an 80-seat majority just two and a half years ago.

5/7/2022,"Sinn Féin appears on track to become the largest party in Northern Ireland’s Stormont assembly in a symbolic breakthrough for Irish nationalism, according to incomplete election results on Friday. Projections put Sinn Féin ahead of the Democratic Unionist party (DUP). If confirmed in final results, it would let the party make history and deliver a shock to unionism by nominating the party’s leader, Michelle O’Neill, as first minister. The other apparent big winner from Thursday’s election was the centrist Alliance, which made gains across Northern Ireland, putting it in third place and consolidating the clout of voters who shun nationalist and unionist labels. An expected DUP boycott could delay and conceivably derail the formation of a new power-sharing executive, putting a question mark over O’Neill becoming first minister, but that would not alter the profound psychological impact of a Sinn Féin victory. “In symbolic terms, Sinn Féin as largest party in Northern Ireland – an entity created on the basis of a unionist majority – would be seismic,” said Jon Tonge, a University of Liverpool politics professor and authority on the region. “A party that does not want Northern Ireland to exist and refuses to even use the term Northern Ireland will become its biggest. It will not trigger a border poll but it is an incremental step on the long road to Irish unity.” Proportional representation in 18 five-member constituencies was used to elect 90 members of the assembly. Turnout was 63.6%, similar to the last assembly election in 2017. Sinn Féin seemed on course to match or exceed the 27 seats it won then, overtaking the DUP which appeared on course to lose several of its 28 seats, said Nicholas Whyte, a psephologist and expert on Northern Ireland elections. Alliance looked set to possibly double its previous total of eight seats, largely at the expense of the Ulster Unionist party (UUP), the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) and the Green party. Transfers will determine final seats, with counting possibly continuing until Saturday. Voters ranked the cost of living and health service as their chief concerns but the campaign was dominated by unionist anger at the post-Brexit Northern Ireland protocol, which puts a trade border in the Irish Sea, and the contest between Sinn Féin and the DUP for the first minister post. That squeezed the UUP and SDLP and let Alliance harvest the growing number of voters in the centre who express frustration at traditional Orange/Green tribalism. Opinion polls show solid support for Northern Ireland remaining in the UK but Sinn Féin hope to build momentum towards a referendum on Irish unity, a goal boosted by the party’s surging popularity in the south of Ireland where it leads the opposition in the Dublin parliament. “We’re feeling very positive,” said O’Neill, after she retained her seat in Mid-Ulster. Sinn Féin’s Conor Murphy, who was finance minister in the last executive, said he was feeling good about the party’s prospects. “The gut is positive for us,” he said. The SDLP leader, Colum Eastwood, said he thought his party would be “squeezed” by the rush of nationalist supporters to Sinn Féin to “send a message” to the DUP over their protocol tactics. Absolute circus here with Michelle O’Neill at count centre. Sinn Fein feeling confident pic.twitter.com/5gUtVw3AyO Many unionists blame the DUP for the protocol, which they fear weakens Northern Ireland’s position in the UK, and some defected to a rightwing rival, the Traditional Unionist Voice. However, Jeffrey Donaldson, the MP and DUP leader, averted meltdown by casting his party as a bulwark against a Sinn Féin first minister. Donaldson said the prospect of O’Neill as first minister was a “problem” and that he would not lead the DUP into the executive until the protocol was replaced, raising the spectre of a stalemate that could last months. Since 2007 there has been a DUP first minister and Sinn Féin deputy first minister. Both posts have equal power but the more prestigious title has become a proxy test of strength. There have been calls to change the titles to co-first minister and to overhaul the Good Friday agreement-era power-sharing rules that did not anticipate the rise of a centrist political force.",News/Politics,Sinn Féin on track to be largest party in Northern Ireland assembly,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/06/sinn-fein-northern-ireland-stormont-assembly-election-results
5/7/2022,"The mood in the room was heated, bordering on mutinous. It was January 2015 and the New York Red Bulls had decided to organise a town-hall meeting with season-ticket holders, a decision they were quickly beginning to regret. Ten days earlier the club had sacked their wildly popular coach Mike Petke. Now, on a freezing Friday night in Harrison, New Jersey, about 300 furious Red Bulls fans wanted to know why. Even though the meeting was supposed to be off the record and no media were invited, footage of the chaotic evening quickly found its way online. The general manager, Marc de Grandpre, and sporting director, Ali Curtis, were mercilessly heckled and interrupted at every turn. “You guys don’t know shit!” one fan shouted at them. Some supporters demanded a refund of their season tickets. Others simply wanted to express their disdain for the decision to sack Petke, a man who had led the Red Bulls to some of the greatest successes in their history, and replace him with an unfancied young coach called Jesse Marsch. For Marsch, who had been given the job 10 days earlier despite possessing the bare minimum of coaching experience in Major League Soccer, it was the most intimidating introduction imaginable. As insults flew across the room, as livid New Yorkers vowed never to visit the stadium again, Marsch simply sat calmly and listened. Eventually, it was his turn to grasp the microphone and speak, and one fact immediately became arrestingly clear. He was enjoying himself. “Believe it or not, I love this passion,” Marsch said. “There’s a lot of clubs in this league that would have none of this. I know how privileged I am to be the coach of this team. I’m excited to be here.” “You have one year,” one fan shouted at him. “You know what?” Marsch shot back. “I’ll take whatever I can get, quite honestly.” That line drew a few chuckles, and as he carried on speaking Marsch began to win the room over. In a way, these situations are where he has always been in his element: connecting, communicating, working a crowd, articulating his vision. He reassured fans who feared a radical overhaul. “I’m not here to take things 180 degrees,” he said. “I’m not here to take away the identity of what the club is.” Three years later, when Marsch left having led the club to two league titles and a Concacaf Champions League semi-final, it’s fair to say he had left his mark. So anyway, that whole business of taking over from a bona fide club legend and winning over a sceptical fanbase: yes, Jesse Marsch has been there and done that. The next 16 days and four games will determine whether Leeds United’s decision to sack the cherished Marcelo Bielsa was the right one. As Marsch prepares for the biggest fight of his managerial career, it is worth remembering that for all the doubt and ridicule he has attracted in his early weeks in English football, for all the stresses and strains that await him over the next fortnight, you suspect this is exactly how he likes it. “A lot of whining, a lot of pissing and moaning,” is how his former Chicago Fire teammate Josh Wolff once described Marsch’s playing style. Marsch, a mean and physical defensive midfielder who picked up 57 yellow cards, was the sort of guy who would go looking for a scrap if he didn’t have one to hand. Arguments and fights in the dressing room were commonplace. And so it would be with Marsch the coach, who has built his personal brand on a taste for constructive confrontation. Three years ago there was a widely shared video of Marsch screaming at his Red Bull Salzburg players during a Champions League game at Anfield. “Es ist nicht ein fucking freundschaftsspiel [It is not a fucking friendly]!” he ranted in an arresting mix of German and English. “This is a fucking Champions League spiel [game]! Wir müssen [we must] get fucking stuck in!” The passion of Marsch’s speech won plenty of admirers, but not everyone grasped its content. He was berating his team for not fouling more Liverpool players. He wanted them to get vindictive. Already, if you compare his first eight games at Leeds with the 26 under Bielsa this season, you can see elements of this style beginning to permeate. Fouls per game are up from 14 to 17. Possession is down from 54% to 50%. Most importantly, a calamitous defence has been tightened, Bielsa’s man-marking system has been ditched for a zonal defence, and results have begun to come. Since Marsch took over Leeds’s underlying numbers suggest they are a top-half side in defence and attack, even if their 4-0 drubbing at home to Manchester City – the same team who put six goals past Marsch’s ill-fated RB Leipzig side this season – was a reminder of the frailties that remain. Certainly Marsch’s time at Leipzig feels like an error on the part of both, a team who had gradually been evolving into a possession-based side under Julian Nagelsmann hiring a coach still wedded to the counterattack and counterpress doctrine. Leeds feels like a better fit, a working-class club with a permanent siege mentality and a keen ear for slights. “I like being the underdog,” he said shortly after arriving. “I don’t know why. I identify with it.” The real question, as Leeds face an unenviable fixture list of Arsenal away on Sunday, then Chelsea and Brighton at home and a visit to Brentford on the final day, is whether it will be enough to keep them up. Fourth from bottom, two points ahead of Everton but having played a game more, Leeds’s fate is no longer in their own hands, and so nor is Marsch’s. For all the criticism of his appointment, Marsch knows better than anyone that it is wins and points that will define him. Inspiring or annoying? Charismatic or self-regarding? A visionary or simply a man who loves the sound of his own voice? “If we lose, you’re going to hate me,” Marsch told those hostile Red Bulls fans seven years ago. “If we win, maybe you’ll learn to put up with me.” Join Jonathan Liew on 24 May as he leads a panel with Andy Cole and more to discuss the role Black British footballers have played both on and off the pitch.

5/7/2022,"Labour activists still shudder at the thought of recent campaigns in many “red wall” areas. In Hartlepool, one recalled seeing canvassers shaking with fear before going out to knock doors. This year, several party figures said, Labour got a hearing again. It may not be the “massive turning point” hailed by Keir Starmer, but there was a feeling after votes had been counted that Labour had made steps towards arresting the decline that helped Boris Johnson to a landslide victory in 2019 – although the road back to power remains long. “It’s not an electoral performance that would get me rushing to the bookmakers to back Keir Starmer as the next prime minister,” said Prof Jonathan Tonge of Liverpool university. “But the Conservatives have got a lot to do to preserve an overall majority – and if they don’t get an overall majority they’re in deep trouble.” With about a third of councils still to declare on Friday, the Conservative share of the vote had fallen around 3% in the leave-voting areas that formed the foundation of its 2019 victory. Labour’s share had nudged up only 1%, said Tonge, showing a party that was “treading water” rather than making the gains that might be expected at this point in the electoral cycle and against a backdrop of Partygate and the cost-of-living crisis. There was cause for celebration in Cumbria, where Labour won two-thirds of seats in the newly-formed Cumberland council where the Tories have three MPs. Further south in Lancashire, Labour regained Rossendale council – home of the former northern powerhouse minister Jake Berry – which it had lost to the Conservatives a year ago. But a failure to capitalise on councils in no overall control, such as Bolton, Derby and the Wirral, was a sign that voters are not rushing back to Labour in areas it previously held for decades. The loss of Labour councillors in coal country – seven in Derbyshire’s Amber Valley and three in Barnsley – was a warning that the party could yet slip further backwards. One former shadow minister who represents a northern constituency said Labour had not yet broken the “barrier” for voters who lent towards Johnson in 2019. “They’ve certainly fallen out with Johnson but they’re not ready to take the leap with us yet. It’s not just Corbyn; the view is quite entrenched and will take a long time and a concerted effort and persistence to recover from.” The last time these council seats were fought, Labour’s red wall was largely still intact, so the room for big advances was limited. In the heavily leave-voting north-east of England, Labour lost seven seats across the six councils that had declared by mid-afternoon on Friday. The Liberal Democrats claimed the most new seats in these areas, where a strong ground campaign and hard work on local issues has given voters another outlet post-Brexit. In Sunderland’s Pallion ward, June Simm said she was a dyed-in-the wool Labour voter before switching to the Tories because of Corbyn. Disillusioned, on Thursday she voted Lib Dem. “They’re great and they’re very nice when they come round. They always send a Christmas card and let you know what they’re up to.” Edward Hutchinson, an 84-year-old retired builder from Sunderland, is typical of the working-class voter who supported Labour all his life until Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. He voted Conservative on Thursday and probably would do so again at the general election. “Look round at this town, it is rubbish at the minute,” he said. “We’ve had a Labour council that many years and I can’t understand why people are keeping them in.” Shabana Mahmood, Labour’s national campaign co-ordinator, said the party has “much more work to do” to be back on track for a win at the next general election but there were signs of progress. Labour number-crunchers said the aggregate vote share showed that it would win red wall seats such as Workington, Grimsby and West Bromwich if Thursday’s votes were translated to a general election. Mahmood said it gave Labour a “solid foundation to build on” before the next national poll, expected to be in May 2024 if not earlier. The assessment was more downbeat among those who spent weeks knocking on voters’ doors. One Labour organiser said the party had done “OK by default” because Tory voters had stayed at home and that Starmer must channel the aspirational spirit of Tony Blair if the party was to recover in satellite towns. “It’s all well and good saying we will give people £600 to help but it’s not a plan to solve the problem,” he said. “We need better answers to the issues facing the country and we need to be much more aspirational about the impact and difference a Labour government will have on people’s lives.”",News/Politics,Labour counts ‘red wall’ gains but admits there is much more work to do,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/06/labour-counts-red-wall-gains-but-admits-there-is-much-more-work-to-do

5/7/2022,"In the wake of the leaked supreme court draft opinion striking down Roe v Wade, “it won’t surprise you to learn that instead of responding to the substance” of protests and fury over the loss of reproductive rights, said Seth Meyers on Thursday’s Late Night. Instead, “the depraved weirdos who make up today’s Republican party decided to mock the people who attended” said protests. Such as the Florida congressman Matt Gaetz, who is currently under investigation for allegedly pursuing a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl and paying for her to travel with him in violation of federal sex trafficking laws. On Wednesday, Gaetz tweeted: “How many of the women rallying against overturning Roe are over-educated, under-loved millennials who sadly return from protests to a lonely microwave dinner with their cats, and no Bumble matches?” “It is very telling that you think ‘over-educated’ is a burn,” said Meyers. “And when they’re not mocking protesters,” he added, “they are of course pretending to be indignant over the leak itself, rather than celebrating the outcome because they know overturning Roe and criminalizing abortion are deeply unpopular with a huge majority of voters. So instead, they want to throw the leaker in jail.” The South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham hyperbolically called the leak “the saddest chapter in the history of the supreme court”. And the Texas senator Ted Cruz called it “the most grotesque politicization of the supreme court in the history of our nation”. “There is no duo in history worse than Ted Cruz and Lindsey Graham,” said Meyers. “You know who was a much better duo?

Weeks ago, Cawthorn set off a firestorm when he accused his Republican colleagues in Congress of hosting cocaine-fueled sex orgies. His remarks drew swift condemnation from fellow Republicans, and “clearly he pissed somebody off,” said Noah. “Because since he made that accusation, week after week, people have been leaking things that seem to be exposing him as a fraud.” Leaked stories have ranged from pictures of Cawthorn in lingerie, allegations of insider trading, and reports he was seen with a male campaign aide’s hand on his crotch. “And now,” said Noah, “in the words of the esteemed political analyst DJ Khaled: another one.” A recently leaked video appears to show Cawthorn, without clothing, pretending to hump his friend’s face on a bed. “Believe me, I wish there was another way to say that, but there’s not. That’s the story,” said Noah. “And you gotta admit, man, these people are coming for Madison Cawthorn. In fact, the way they’re coming for Madison Cawthorn, I’m starting to think maybe those cocaine orgies were real, you know? He said too much.” In response to the nude video, Cawthorn said in a video statement: “You are witnessing one of the first politicians who grew up with a cellphone in their hand … most of my colleagues in Congress right now would not be serving in Washington if they grew up within a single mile of a cellphone. “As much as I do not like him, I have to agree,” Noah said. “Since the beginning of time, people have had the ability to insulate what they do in private from what they do in public. But now, we have a whole generation who’s growing up documenting every single dumb thing they do or say or hump. And honestly, unless they’re breaking the law, we’re gonna have to figure out how to deal with this in society. “Because thanks to phones, everyone’s friends have dirt on them,” he concluded. “In fact, if your friends don’t have dirt on you that could someday ruin your career, then I’m sorry, you’re not friends. You’re just acquaintances.” And on The Late Show, Stephen Colbert mocked an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network this week in which Donald Trump said “nobody has done more for Christianity, nobody has done more for religions of all types, than me”. “That’s a bit of a bold statement,” Colbert deadpanned. “But I’ll say this: he’s right about Christianity. For four years he certainly inspired me to say ‘Je-sus’.” The “religions of all kinds” bit “also makes sense”, he joked. “He’s got the wrath of Yahweh, the destructive power of Shiva, the BMI of Buddha and the sexual assault history of Zeus.” Trump also bragged in the same interview about acing an IQ test – “They now call me a dictator and other things but they don’t call you stupid,” he said. “He thinks we don’t call him stupid? What a moron,” Colbert responded. “He’s been bragging about this for years as some sort of remarkable achievement on what he thinks is an IQ test, which it’s not,” he added, as the 10-minute test is designed to detect mild cognitive impairment. “It’s a little disturbing when he says he doesn’t mind being called a dictator as long as people don’t think he’s dumb.”",Arts/Culture,Seth Meyers rips Matt Gaetz: ‘Very telling you think “over-educated” is a burn’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/06/seth-meyers-republican-matt-gaetz-late-night-tv
5/7/2022,"Scottish Labour is set to become the closest challenger to Nicola Sturgeon’s Scottish National party after Conservative support plunged to its worst electoral result in a decade. Labour enjoyed an unexpected win in SNP-controlled West Dunbartonshire, taking overall control of the council, as it won a swathe of seats across Scotland’s 32 councils and made surprise gains, putting it on course to take the second largest share of the vote. In one surprise result, Labour came very close to beating the SNP in Glasgow, Sturgeon’s home city, and was just one seat short of victory. Labour gained five seats and the SNP lost two, raising the prospects the SNP may form a formal coalition there with the Greens, whose support climbed to win 10 seats at the SNP’s expense. Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, said: “This is the first positive and cheerful day for the Scottish Labour party [after 10 years of defeats] and I’m very confident by the end of the day we’ll be in comfortable second place in Scotland. Our eyes are now firmly set on the SNP.” The results triggered sharp recriminations among Scottish Tories, who found themselves relegated to third after voters punished them over the Partygate crisis by abstaining from the elections or switching support to Labour or the Liberal Democrats. Embarrassed by defeats in wealthy areas such as Edinburgh and East Renfrewshire, the Tories enjoyed a rare glimmer of success in the Scottish leader Douglas Ross’s home area of Moray in north-east Scotland, gaining three seats. Ross said: “It’s been a difficult night and in some areas it has been very disappointing. In too many parts of Scotland we’ve lost excellent candidates.” He said the Partygate scandal had dominated conversations with voters, combined with the cost of living crisis. “There’s absolutely no doubt that people have sent a message to the prime minister and the government, particularly around Partygate. That’s absolutely clear.” The SNP remained dominant, narrowly winning control of Dundee by a single seat after five years in minority government, and by 5pm on Friday had won 445 of the 1,227 available seats, up 24, with only a few councils still to declare. But Sturgeon, the first minister and SNP leader, endured a few moments of anxiety as the Scottish Greens, the SNP’s partners at Holyrood, enjoyed a surge of support in city and rural elections. In Glasgow, the first signal the SNP was in difficulty came when its group leader, Susan Aitken, was unexpectedly beaten in her ward on first preferences by a Scottish Green candidate, Holly Bruce. Aitken held her seat after second preference votes were counted. Across Scotland, the SNP remained the largest party in numerous authorities, including Perth and Kinross, Edinburgh, Stirling, and Angus, where the Tories shed seats. In Fife, the SNP gained five seats and the Lib Dems gained five, at the expense of Labour, who lost four, and the Tories, who lost six. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, said it was “full steam ahead” with the Scottish government’s plans for a second independence referendum. “The boiler is being stoked”, he said, with Sturgeon due to publish a series of position papers on the potential of independence this summer. “Our commitment to the people of Scotland is that we will absolutely deliver on the mandate they give us,” he said. The Greens were in buoyant mood after gaining their first seats on several councils across the country, including Shetland, East Lothian and Scottish Borders, and increasing their tallies in areas including Orkney and Highlands. Party strategists believe they are reaping the benefits of their power-sharing deal with the SNP following last May’s Holyrood elections, which has made it far easier to convince voters that a first preference for the Greens will not be wasted. In Glasgow, newly elected Greens included the city’s first trans councillor, Elaine Gallagher. The elections were disastrous for Alex Salmond’s breakaway nationalist party Alba, as it failed to hold either of its two council seats and won only a smattering of votes elsewhere in its second electoral test. Despite fielding 111 candidates, it again failed to make a single breakthrough. Alba’s general secretary, Chris McEleny, who defected from the SNP, lost his Inverclyde council seat, polling 126 votes. Another Alba candidate in Inverclyde, who had been elected for the SNP in the last election, also lost his seat. Both seats were regained by SNP candidates. Labour’s victory in West Dunbartonshire, where it won 12 of 22 seats, has added significance because the proportional representation voting system used in Scottish council elections rarely allows one party to win an overall majority. In the 2017 election, no party had overall control in any of Scotland’s 32 local authorities. Scotland’s three island authorities, the Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland, are also dominated by unaligned independent councillors, so have no single party in power. The Western Isles, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar in Gaelic, had the most significant developments of the island authorities when its unwelcome status as Scotland’s only all-male council ended with the election of two women, Frances Murray and Susan Thomson, both for the SNP. Voters in North Uist also elected the Western Isles’ first minority ethnic councillor, Mustapha Hocine, a popular Algerian-born teacher. Eight women stood for election after a concerted campaign by the council and equalities activists to improve gender diversity. Catrìona Murray, a community activist who failed to win a seat, said the council and community still had a great deal of work to do to improve diversity. She said the low proportion of female councillors would continue to dog the council and needed to be addressed. “I just don’t like the image it gives people of the Western Isles. It’s a mistaken image because women are electable,” she said.",News/Politics,Labour heading for second in Scottish elections as Tory vote plummets,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/06/labour-heading-second-scottish-elections-tory-vote-plummets-snp
5/7/2022,"It was proclaimed moribund, if not doomed, just a year ago. But now, is business class air travel taking off again? British Airways’ owner IAG, forecasting a return to profit this year, said that a strong recovery in business bookings was driving the recovery. In a world where half the City can no longer be bothered to get on the Northern line to return to the office, and bankers begrudge the cost of a train from Surrey, how can airlines claim to be pulling this off? There are a couple of things to note. Firstly, not all the premium seats are necessarily occupied by passengers travelling solely for work. Plenty of holiday companies, from the travel giant TUI to BA itself, have reported that more affluent customers, who kept earning and in some cases amassed hefty savings while forced to stay at home during the pandemic, are now blowing a lot more on a holiday – even as the cost of living crisis hits many. But work trips are also returning. The bigger, multinational firms may have adopted Zoom for many internal meetings, with long-term effects for airlines. Most assume there will be far fewer of the kind of flights simply for, say, a European managing director to touch base with a boss in a US global headquarters. However, many small and medium firms say they cannot do business that way, particularly in terms of winning new clients or sealing contracts. That isn’t necessarily just to the benefit of the likes of IAG, with wide-body planes and business class cabins: in short-haul, easyJet has claimed to steal a march among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) whose budgets may be ever tighter. BA’s boss, Sean Doyle, confirms that the SMEs were the first to return, but the bigger corporations are now booking, with banking and finance leading the charge to the skies. Accountancy and consultancy are close behind, and sectors such as IT and pharmaceuticals are now coming back. Speaking as owner IAG announced quarterly results, Doyle said business traffic was 2.5 times higher in March than it was in January, and was now back to 65%-70% of 2019 levels. The lucrative transatlantic routes remain the focus, with bookings coming in from both ends – still led by leisure, but for business, “momentum is building”. There are clear barriers still to a full recovery: strict Covid entry policies deter or prohibit flights to some key Asian business destinations, especially China, Hong Kong and Japan. The climate crisis is pushing companies to burnish their environmental credentials, and curbing their own air travel is an obvious way to reduce their carbon footprint. But conferences are going back “real world” rather than online, and many employees will be desperate to see the world after being cooped up for two years. Arguably the pandemic has made business travel more feasible: working remotely has proved that staff do not need to be in the office to be productive. Rather than just whizzing home after a packed schedule, staff can conduct more of their normal duties while staying abroad longer – potentially more palatable to both the firm and the business traveller. Good news for BA, if bad news for the passengers upgrading their holiday – the front of the cabin, says Doyle, is looking ever more like 2019 all over again.",News/Business,Business class travel helps post-pandemic airline sales take off ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/06/business-class-travel-helps-post-pandemic-airline-sales-take-off
5/7/2022,"To All Those Who Dare Rob Us of Our Bodily Choice, I ask you: What is it about our bodies that makes you so afraid, so insecure, so cruel and punishing? Is it their singular autonomy or mere existence? Is it their capacity for immense and unending pleasure – orgasms that can multiply orgasms inside orgasms? Is it our skin? Is it our desire? Is it our openness that rattles you and reminds you of where you are closed? Is it the pure strength of our bodies that allows us to bleed and birth and bend and carry and continue on in spite of all the ways you have reduced us and objectified us, humiliated us and disrespected us and tried to shape us into baby-making machines? Our strength that is inherent and doesn’t need to prove itself or show off or rely on weapons or violence to control and terrorise? Doesn’t need to abolish laws, or lie to become supreme court judges or president or rig the decks when they get there. Do you know this power? Can you imagine it? A power that comes from respecting life, caring for others before oneself, holding communities together? Do you think we are naive enough to believe that you are motivated by your care for life when you have shown so little respect for it and us? Instead you spend your days unravelling and resisting all that makes life possible for those mothers and people with babies you claim to protect – fighting against free universal healthcare, parental paid leave and child allowance. Where’s your outrage that the US has the highest maternal mortality rates in the developed world? Do you think we have forgotten that some of those (Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas) who are making the most crucial decisions about millions of our bodies and the one (Donald Trump) who chose three of the people on the court currently making these decisions, are men who have been accused of violating other women’s bodies, harassing women’s bodies, humiliating and proudly bragging about grabbing the genitals of women’s bodies? What is it about our bodies that make you think you have the right to invade them, determine them, control and legislate them, violate and force them to do anything against their will? Perhaps you mistake our generosity for weakness, our patience for passivity, our vulnerability for fragility. This might be why you are unable to see that there is no chance in hell that we are ever going back. This is not a law yet and we will never accept this ruling. Perhaps because you have never known what it is like to have your body controlled by the vindictive anonymous state, to be raped and forced to keep your baby, to be so desperate that you destroy your uterus with a hanger or bleed to death in a back alley, you do not understand that once you have tasted the sweetness of freedom, of choice, once you have come to know your body as your own, once you have freed yourself and felt the expanse of your body, the aliveness in every pore that rises from autonomy, there is no way you will ever give that up. Ever. And because you do not know this, you do not know how dangerous we are, how organised we are, how willing we are to go any lengths to preserve our freedom. It’s been 50 years. We have summoned our due. We actually have bank accounts now. We have credit cards and we can buy a house. We can serve on juries. We hold offices and are lawyers. We write for newspapers and we run them. We host TV shows and direct movies. We run hospitals and universities and non-profits and write plays about vaginas and books about fascists and fascism. We can’t be tossed aside. This is our world now. And these are our bodies. We know what you are up to – this is just the beginning of your diabolical plan to rob us of contraception and marriage equality and civil rights and on and on. This is all part of your desperation to prevent the future that is on the verge of being born – a future where we know our past and begin to reckon with it, a future where we teach critical race theory and the truth about white supremacy and sexism and transphobia. A future where we care for our Earth and devote our lives to protecting air and water and forests and animals and all living things, a future where people have autonomy over their bodies and wombs and gender and marry who they want to, and don’t get married if they don’t want to, and have babies if they want to, and don’t have babies if they don’t want to. Despite all your lies, strategies and devious ways you are simply never going to stop us. You have unleashed our fury, our solidarity, our unity. We know that our future and everything we have fought for is at stake. I am willing to lay my body down for this freedom, for every freedom and I know there are multitudes who will do the same.

5/7/2022,"The dish comes to the table topped with generous amounts of garlic and coriander, in a sauce of olive oil and clam juice, ripe for mopping with the slices of rustic bread in the basket. The scene before us couldn’t be brighter. I don’t mean the immense blue of the waters of Ria Formosa, but this fragrant plate of clams a Bulhão Pato in the foreground. Although originally created in downtown Lisbon for 19th-century writer and gourmand Bulhão Pato, it’s in the Algarve that the dish really sings – the fabulously fresh local ingredients showing it off as, arguably, one of the finest recipes ever invented for seafood, even though it’s so simple: olive oil, garlic, white wine and coriander. Clams a Bulhão Pato; the blue waters of Ria Formosa; the locally caught seafood is praised across Europe The cuisine of the Algarve is one of the most celebrated in Portugal, featuring some of the finest fresh produce in the country. Its beautiful coast connects both with the Atlantic and the Mediterranean traditions. Its seafood is praised by chefs across Europe, and the prized Algarve scarlett prawns or the clams of the marshes of Ria Formosa are things of beauty, delighting diners in both Michelin-starred restaurants and humble cervejarias across the region. To see the bounty of the Algarve at its freshest, there’s nothing better than a visit to the markets in Olhão: two red brick buildings with dome turrets that have become the iconic symbol of this fishing town. One pavilion has just fish and seafood stalls, while the other offers vegetables and fruit, as well as the olives, almonds and figs of the Algarve. On Saturday morning the farmers from the region descend to the waterfront to sell their best oranges, strawberries, honey or piri piri chillies. The smell of frying dough invades the cafes and terraces, as giant churros covered in sugar and cinnamon are sold from a local food truck. The markets in Olhão with their domed turrets – one is dedicated to seafood Olhão is the largest fishing port in the region, and with its maze-like old town – known locally as the “cubist quarter” – it maintains a distinct identity from nearby Faro, the capital of Algarve. Inside these winding streets and alleys are excellent lunch spots such as Chá Chá Chá, opened by food writer Kevin Gould, with a lovely terrace and daily-changing menu based on what’s available at the market (joyfully, almost always clams). There’s also Vai e Volta, a small tasca that specialises in wonderful charcoal-grilled fish. On the way out of Olhão, make a stop on the N125 – the road that will take you towards Faro – at Pastelaria Kubidoce to enjoy the delicious pastries and sweet creations of talented local baker Filipe Martins, who built a loyal following for his pastries and bread. You’ll find a splendid version of folar here – a light, layered, buttery cinnamon cake that is one of Olhão’s specialities. Inside the well-preserved walls of Faro’s old town, you’ll find Tertúlia Algarvia, known for traditional Algarve dishes, especially the cataplana – a word that means both the copper pot and the dish cooked in it. To learn more about this unique product of the Algarve, you can visit a traditional workshop in Loulé, where you can see the craftsmen working and the pot taking shape: from a flat copper sheet to the domed and dimpled halves of the finished article – which bears no small resemblance to a clam itself, funnily enough. Cataplana at Tertúlia Algarvia Where to stayIf you’re looking for luxury lodgings, Domes Lake Algarve is within touching distance of both Faro and Olhão – and it has an enviable culinary reputation of its own. Set moments walk from a long, sandy stretch of Falésia beach, the resort is home to two elegant bars and three signature restaurants. If you’re in the mood for an aperitif, start off at Raw gastro bar, which pairs original cocktails with innovative small plates, such as gravadlax cured with Algarve citrus, and sea bass and scallop tartare crostinis. Domes Lake Algarve is centred around a freshwater lake and sand-bottom pool; restaurants include Topos And there’s plenty to play with once you’re ready to settle into a meal. For more of a taste of the Algarve, you’ll find contemporary comfort dishes served up with outstanding local wines at Gustatio, were the daily-changing buffet runs from Algarvian coastal cuisine and petiscos (Portuguese small plates) to local meat and fish cooked live on the grill. For award-winning modern Greek, there’s Topos, with a menu featuring octopus and red wine stew, miso-marinated cod and lamb loin souvlaki, washed down with some of the finest wines of the Aegean. Apricus pool bar is all about fresh, healthy fare with super-local ingredients – think chicken salad with sweet Algarvian oranges. And if you’re looking for something with that extra wow factor for a special occasion, anchored on a floating esplanade on the resort’s private lake is Makris, which offers a Mediterranean-inspired menu paired again with the region’s fine wines. The resort’s pools are the perfect place to relax, with a poolside bar and shady palms And opening this season is the newest addition to Domes Lake Algarve: SORA Beach. This beachfront bar and restaurant will serve up a menu from executive chef Vitor Moreira, featuring Algarve-style seafood, cocktails and snacks straight to your sunbed. In between these gastronomic delights, there are plenty of activities to work up an appetite. The resort has a private saltwater lake for watersports, a natural sand-bottom pool – as well as two other pools – in addition to an eco-conscious learning garden for toddlers and children, and the award-winning Soma Spa. And, for those who fancy a round of golf, there are five courses alone in Vilamoura, just minutes away from the resort (which runs free shuttles to all of them), and more than 20 in total within a half-hour drive. So you’ve spent the day on the beach, by the pool, swinging the clubs, or just exploring the region, then you’ve treated yourself to a world-class meal just a hop from your room. What about that nightcap? There are luxe surrounds, guest DJs and cocktails at Apricus pool bar.

5/7/2022,"A woman who ran a Belarusian opposition messaging app channel and was arrested along with her activist boyfriend when an airliner they were on was forced to land in Belarus has been convicted of charges that included inciting social hatred. Following her conviction, Sofia Sapega was sentenced to six years in prison. Sapega is a Russian citizen, and her lawyer, Anton Gashinsky, said she would appeal to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to intervene. Sapega and Roman Protasevich were flying from Athens to Vilnius, Lithuania, a year ago when their plane was ordered to land in Belarus accompanied by a fighter jet because of an alleged bomb threat. Protasevich was the editor of Nexta, a popular channel on the Telegram messaging app that was used to help organise protests in Belarus after the president, Alexander Lukashenko, won a disputed sixth term in August 2020. Sapega ran another Telegram channel that published the personal data of civil servants and military personnel who took part in mass repressions of the protests. Western countries denounced the plane diversion as tantamount to air piracy by Belarus. The European Union banned Belarusian airlines from its air space and airports as part of sanctions against the country. “I am sorry for Sofia and her family. No one should suffer from dictatorship,” the exiled Belarus opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya wrote on Twitter after Friday’s verdict. The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Sapega would get assistance, but declined to comment on the sentence itself. “She is a citizen of Russia, so in any case, through our diplomats and other channels, we will continue to protect her legitimate interests,” he told reporters on a conference call. Asked, whether he thought the verdict was fair, Peskov said: “We greatly dislike it when someone comments on the decisions of our courts, so we will not comment the decision of the court in friendly Belarus.” The post-election protests were the most serious challenge to Lukashenko’s authoritarian rule since he first took office in 1994. The protests attracted as many as 200,000 people in the capital of Belarus on some days and persisted for several months. Authorities responded with a severe crackdown in which police arrested more than 35,000 people and thousands were beaten.
