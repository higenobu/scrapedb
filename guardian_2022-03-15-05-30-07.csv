3/15/2022,"Manchester United are considering all options regarding updating Old Trafford, including knocking the stadium down and building a new one on the same site. While the bulldozing of the stadium would be unpopular with a sizeable proportion of fans, this is understood to be the least likely choice at the current juncture, with one significant obstacle being where the team would play their home games while the new venue was under construction. Other options may include razing and rebuilding Old Trafford’s South Stand or undergoing a complete revamp of the existing structure. Given the large footprint of the site whatever choice is made the club’s wider vision may be to position the stadium as the centre of a cultural and community hub, similar to Tottenham Hotspur’s stadium, which opened three years ago and cost around £1bn. United’s executive is in the process of fielding different ideas from companies who would tender to carry out any work on a venue that was first built in 1910. But until a master planner is appointed no concrete decision will be made, with the club having committed to consulting with supporters throughout the process. No notable modernisation of Old Trafford has occurred since Malcolm Glazer bought the club in 2005 – the increased capacity to 75,000 via the quadrants built in 2006 was approved before the now deceased American became proprietor. Last month Collette Roche, United’s chief operating officer, discussed the future of Old Trafford with the club fans’ forum. “We have been assessing the capabilities of globally leading consultants who want to help us develop a masterplan for the modernisation of Old Trafford, with the ultimate aim of improving the matchday experience for fans,” she said. “We are hoping to appoint our preferred partners in the coming weeks; following this, we will be able to formally kick off phase one of the project, which will be focused on establishing the vision and objectives for the masterplan.” United invested almost £20m in Old Trafford in 2019 – £11m was spent on improvements to accessible facilities, £4m on security and £4m on refurbishing hospitality locales.",Sport/Football,Manchester United considering Old Trafford demolition as part of revamp,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/14/manchester-united-considering-old-trafford-demolition-as-part-of-revamp
3/15/2022,"Lewis Hamilton has proved to be an inspiration for prisoners in Bahrain after demanding last year that Formula One takes responsibility for human rights issues in the countries it visits, with his car number, 44, being adopted by some inmates. F1 begins its new season this weekend in Bahrain, a country strongly criticised for abuse by human rights organisations. On Monday, Ali Alhajee a prisoner in Bahrain, wrote to Hamilton explaining how the seven-times champion had made a difference. Alhajee explained that the political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Bahrain’s Jau prison had previously boycotted watching F1 because of its role in sportswashing the regime. Hamilton’s outspoken stance on human rights and his support last year for some political prisoners who wrote to him from Bahrain has changed their attitude. “Your genuine concern about these cases has changed the way prisoners think of this sport,” he wrote in a letter shared with the Guardian by the Bahrain Institute for Human Rights (Bird). “To us, you are our champ, not only the best in driving but also a human being who cares about the suffering of others. To reflect our support to you, a new phenomenon spread in the prison. Inmates began to write or draw ‘Sir 44’ or ‘Lewis 44’ on their clothes, which we would wear in support while watching the race.” Alhajee claims he has been subjected to torture during his interrogation and that he was sentenced to 10 years in prison for organising peaceful protests in Manama, the capital of Bahrain. “I am a free man despite my handcuffs and the prison walls. The cement walls in this prison did not stop me from exposing the human rights abuses we suffer from within,” he told Hamilton. “The prisoners view you not only as a world sports champion but as someone who is defending their human rights. I, along with my other cellmates, wish you the very best in your race in Bahrain. Please remember that you have supporters in the prison who will follow and cheer you on for all of your races.” Various groups are once more demanding F1 and the FIA act to make a difference in Bahrain, which has recently signed what is believed to be the longest contract in F1 history in regards to hosting meetings – to 2036. Bird has written to F1 questioning their failure to set up an inquiry investigating the race’s impact on human rights abuse and requested F1 use its platform and influence with Bahrain to secure redress for victims of abuses. The organisation cites the state’s “heavy repression” last year and how it has “sustained its violent campaign of persecution against political dissidents, and escalated its targeting of children”. Bird has also written to drivers, including Sebastian Vettel, Max Verstappen, George Russell and Lando Norris, requesting they make “a stand against war everywhere”, noting drivers had rightly taken a stance against racing in Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. The organisation has called for them to acknowledge rights violations everywhere and notably that the Saudi Arabia-led coalition, which includes Bahrain and the UAE, is engaged in a seven-year military campaign against Yemen. According to a 2021 UN report, the coalition has “commit egregious violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law, including indiscriminate attacks against civilians, forced disappearances and torture”. A coalition of human rights groups will write to F1 on Tuesday expressing their desire for the sport’s owners to take action, while a cross-party group of MPs from the UK and Europe will address their concerns on Wednesday about Bahrain to the FIA, demanding the sport’s governing body takes responsibility for the race’s impact in Bahrain. F1 said: “We take our responsibilities on rights very seriously and set high ethical standards for counterparties and those in our supply chain, which are enshrined in contracts, and we pay close attention to their adherence.” A Bahraini government spokesperson said: “Bahrain has led human rights reform in the region and to suggest otherwise does not reflect current-day reality. To attempt to single out Bahrain in the Formula One calendar is absurd, lacks context, and entirely undermines the enormous strides and leadership Bahrain has shown in this area. “Bahrain welcomes and actively supports the role Formula One can play in shedding light on human rights issues in all countries it operates in, now and in the future.”",Sport/Sport,‘You are our champ’: Prisoner in Bahrain jail sends letter to Lewis Hamilton,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/14/you-are-our-champ-prisoner-bahrain-jail-letter-lewis-hamilton-f1
3/15/2022,"Scientists are calling for the immediate rollout of Covid vaccines to primary-aged children, as new data suggests that even a single dose of the Pfizer jab helps to prevent older children against infection, and shortens the duration and severity of symptoms if they do get infected. According to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics, 2- to 11-year-olds have the highest rate of infections of any UK age group, with 4.2% testing positive during the week ending 5 March. Secondary-aged children (up to Year 11) have the lowest rate of infections, with 2.4% testing positive. The UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) approved the vaccination of healthy 5- to 11-year-olds on 16 February. At the time, Sajid Javid said the NHS would prepare to extend this “non-urgent” vaccination offer to all children during April “to increase protection against potential future waves of Covid-19” – but parents are still unable to book an appointment, and it is unclear how vaccines will be delivered to this age group. Some scientists fear that a new wave is now fast approaching – and with barely any primary-aged children vaccinated, and only around a quarter of 12- to 15-year-olds having received a second dose. “I just don’t understand what the lack of urgency and the complacency is,” said Dr Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds. “The BA.2 variant is surging across Europe, and kids are still going to be at school through to the summer.” He added that while the risk of Covid to children is small, “it is magnified greatly when the virus is so prevalent”. Recent data published by the US Centres for Disease Control suggested that unvaccinated 5- to 11-year-olds were three times more likely to be admitted to hospital during January, compared to those who had received two vaccine doses. Russell Viner, a professor of child and adolescent health at University College London, said while there were pragmatic and technical challenges associated with the mass vaccination of younger children, these issues should have been overcome by now. “I do believe there’s an argument to get on with this,” he said. “The medical arguments are marginal for children, but once the decision has been made that the vaccine is safe, has some effectiveness, and on balance, parents should be able to opt in for their children if they so wish, there’s an equity argument to say that the system now needs to deliver that for children. “Children have been at the back of the queue for benefits right across this pandemic. If they are entitled to a vaccination, they should have access to it if they want it.” Irene Petersen, a professor of epidemiology and health informatics at University College London, said if the vaccines are going to have any impact it is important that they are given before an outbreak. Vaccinating younger children now, might also enable them to receive a second dose before the Autumn. According to JCVI guidance, 5- to 11-year-olds shouldn’t be offered a second dose until at least 12 weeks after their first jab. Their warnings came as new data suggested a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine almost eliminated the risk of reinfection for at least 100 days for 12- to 17-year-olds who had recovered from Covid. The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, analysed data from 115,775 British adolescents, whose parents reported their symptoms and vaccination status via the Zoe Covid symptom study app. It also suggested that a single vaccine dose reduced the risk of infection with Omicron by 53.7% at 14–30 days, rising to 57.9% at 31–60 days, and by 63.7% after 61–90 days. Among 12- to 15-year-olds who did become infected with Omicron, the following symptoms were less common among those who’d received a single vaccine dose: loss of smell, fever, low appetite, abdominal pains, and muscle pain. Senior author Profr Emma Duncan from King’s College London said the findings highlighted the benefits of being vaccinated – both in terms of protection from illness, and avoiding further disruption to children’s education. “Our data suggest that even a single dose decreases the chance of getting infected, and that benefit is seen even more in those people who have had a previous infection,” she said.",News/World news,Scientists call for immediate rollout of Covid jab for UK primary school children,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/scientists-call-for-immediate-rollout-of-covid-jab-for-uk-primary-school-children
3/15/2022,"Roman Abramovich, the billionaire owner of Chelsea FC who was subjected to sanctions by the UK government last week, has been spotted at a VIP lounge at an airport in Israel. One of seven Russians who had their assets frozen last Thursday in an attempt to ratchet up the pressure on Vladimir Putin after the invasion of Ukraine, Abramovich was seen in Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion airport on Monday shortly before a jet linked to him took off for Istanbul. A photograph obtained by Reuters showed the oligarch sitting in the airport’s VIP lounge with a face mask pulled down over his chin. The news agency said it could not independently verify if he boarded the flight to Turkey. The sanctions against Abramovich – brought in years after campaigners first raised concerns about his ties to the Russian president – have come amid a wider western crackdown on the country’s wealthy business elite. EU authorities have begun seizing assets, including superyachts docked in Mediterranean ports, over recent weeks, prompting oligarchs accused of being close to Putin to seek safe havens elsewhere. One source told Reuters the plane used by Abramovich flew into Ben Gurion late on Sunday from Moscow. The flight-tracking website Radarbox said the aircraft, which has the tail number LX-RAY, took off on Monday for Istanbul. Israeli restrictions imposed on private jets since the invasion of Ukraine meant it could not remain on the ground for more than 24 hours. A British transport ministry source told Reuters on Friday that the UK was searching for helicopters and jets belonging to the oligarchs named in last week’s sanctions. Abramovich was targeted because the UK government’s Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation suspected that a steel company he had effective control of, Evraz plc, supplied steel to the Russian military to produce tanks. Abramovich, who also holds Israeli and Portuguese citizenship, has denied having close ties to the Russian president. In the wake of sanctions being imposed, Russian oligarchs have reportedly fled western capitals, including London, where they have business links and homes, with the country’s wealthy elite said to be either returning to Moscow or heading to countries outside the UK, EU and US. Reuters said one of Abramovich’s own yachts, thought to be worth $600m (£460m), arrived in Montenegro’s territorial waters on Sunday. However, the UK government has faced heavy criticism from opposition MPs for acting too late to stop oligarchs, who became concerned about the threat of sanctions weeks ago, from removing their assets from the country. Abramovich’s private jet reportedly left the UK in late February. Although he has built up a property portfolio in London, the billionaire has previously said he effectively lives on a plane, splitting his time between Moscow, London and New York. In 2006 he told the Guardian he did not regard the British capital as home, although he said it was his “first choice” of place to be after Moscow. His UK properties reportedly include a 15-bedroom mansion on Kensington Palace Gardens in central London that was bought for £90m in 2009, and a Chelsea penthouse overlooking the River Thames bought in 2018 for a reported £22m.",News/World news,Roman Abramovich spotted at Israeli airport following UK sanctions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/roman-abramovich-spotted-israeli-airport-uk-sanctions
3/15/2022,"Good morning. Ukraine’s president is expected to make a powerful plea to US Congress on Wednesday, urging the west to take a stronger line against Vladimir Putin. In Australia, the soaring cost of living is outstripping wage increases. And the prime minister, Scott Morrison, says the Coalition wants Australia’s coal power stations to “run as long as they possibly can”. The world is facing a potential food crisis, with soaring prices and millions in danger of severe hunger, as the war in Ukraine threatens supplies of key staple crops, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization has warned. Ukraine’s war-ravaged economy could also shrink by up to 35% this year if Russia’s invasion becomes a protracted conflict, according to the International Monetary Fund. Talks between Russia and Ukraine started on Monday and the communication between the two sides was hard but ongoing, the Ukrainian presidential adviser and negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, tweeted. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine, will address US Congress on Wednesday, where he is expected to intensify pressure on the US president, Joe Biden, to allow the transfer of MiG-29 fighter jets from Poland. Although many countries believe boycotts and sanctions are the answer, Germany has warned that an immediate boycott of Russian gas and oil supplies could hurt its own population more than Vladimir Putin, bringing mass unemployment and poverty. Scott Morrison has said the Coalition wants Australia’s coal power stations to “run as long as they possibly can”, vowing to support the coal industry if re-elected. The prime minister made the comments in a Sky News town hall on the New South Wales central coast on Monday. Asked by the audience if he supports the coal industry, Morrison replied “the short answer is yes” but stopped short of endorsing a call for the government to build new coal power stations. Australia’s soaring cost of living is outstripping wage increases, leaving the average worker more than $800 worse off in 2021, the steepest cut in real terms for more than 20 years, according to the Australian Council of Trade Unions president, Michele O’Neil. The contraction in spending power happened during Covid supply chain shortages, while Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has only propelled prices of fuel and food higher. In a speech to the Australia Institute on Tuesday, O’Neil will say a worker on the average income of $68,000 last year effectively had a pay cut of $832 as price increases overwhelmed any meagre wage increases. In 2021, consumer prices rose 3.5% and wages 2.3%, the ABS said.

All remaining Covid travel restrictions are to be dropped in England from later this week, government sources have said, despite a concerning rise in cases and hospitalisations. A three-year-old boy accidentally shot his mother dead as the family sat in their car in a parking lot at a supermarket in a suburb of Chicago, police said. The woman was shot on Saturday in Dolton and pronounced dead in hospital, police said. “I think I would watch it every day, twice a day, if I thought I could get away with it,” writes the Guardian’s film critic, Peter Bradshaw, about Licorice Pizza. “The sheer pleasure of this film is somehow not directly connected with performances, or narrative, or genre (the genre here is almost impossible to pin down) but with its pure texture, which is sensual and sublime.” “Why am I so floored by the death of my first, long ago, love?” asks a Guardian reader to advice columnist Philippa Perry. “A first love may not be mature love, but they can be a catalyst in teaching you how you love and helping you to know who you are,” says Perry. “You can be expected to feel utterly devastated when their life is cut cruelly short.” Playing a music festival a day after Archie Roach buried his partner Ruby Hunter helped the singer honour her memory – and crystallised just how much he needed his audience. “We got through it, I don’t know how,” he said. “I think Ruby had a hand in there somewhere.” It’s been more than two decades since Putin ascended to the highest office of the largest country in the world, assuming the Russian presidency after Boris Yeltsin resigned in 1999. In the years since, Putin has cultivated a larger-than-life image. Now, as Putin’s war in Ukraine enters its third week, and the humanitarian toll of his assault grows, the world is asking: What does Putin really want, how far will he go to get it, and can the Russian people stop him?

3/15/2022,"The drama in Abigail’s Party focuses on the toe-curling intrigues in Bev’s suburban living room over the course of her car-crash soiree. But what about the eponymous do in Mike Leigh’s comedy of manners – the party next door, thrown by the teenage Abigail while her mother, Sue, languishes at Bev’s? Abigail, who remains an offstage McGuffin in Leigh’s play, is now set to take centre stage in a complementary spin-off production alongside a revival of Leigh’s 1977 satire at Watford Palace theatre. Abi’s House Party will show us what happens at Abi’s bash while the adults are having their meltdowns. Other dramatists have already focused on the life of this absent character, such as Atiha Sen Gupta in her 2018 play Abi, but this production is a full-on imagining of the party itself, with a 30-strong cast of young actors whose ages range from 11 to 25. Much of the action will happen offstage, and will be reported by characters – as is often the case at parties. James Williams, the theatre’s associate director, suggested dramatising a spin-off teen house party alongside Leigh’s play in 2020, before the pandemic, and was heartened when actors from the theatre’s youth company watched the TV adaptation, starring Alison Steadman, and identified with its observations on social awkwardness, despite its period detail – from pineapple on sticks to Demis Roussos. “People talk about it as a play specifically about class but it’s really a human play,” says Williams. Abi’s House Party was jointly devised by members of the Palace Young Company, Palace Youth Theatre and Young Orbital group, with some of the same improvisation techniques that Leigh is said to have used for the original: actors focusing on the movements and mannerisms of people they know as a way of fleshing out characterisation. There is a range of partygoers, from invited guests to gatecrashers and hangers-on. Williams, as its director, tried not to impede the young artists’ vision for the piece. “I wanted it to be as authentic as possible.” It will cater for two audiences, he adds, those who know and love Leigh’s play but are curious about the “other” party up the road, and the younger contingent interested to see a play about a teen party. It is set in the contemporary world, reflecting the reality of teen culture and party protocols today, and performed on the same set as Abigail’s Party, with a central 1970s shelving unit as a backdrop which will be redressed, the period objects swapped for contemporary ones. Importantly, it has evolved from its original vision in 2020 to incorporate some of the anxieties that have emerged for young people over social rituals since, as a result of lockdown. “We can’t talk about partying without people’s reference points being very different to what they were before,” says Williams. Megan Breen, a 24-year-old creative facilitator at the Palace Young Company who is playing a 20-year-old gatecrasher, feels the play offers a commentary on being a teenager – of “wanting to be an adult but not knowing how to get there” – and also the psychological and social effects of the pandemic on teen life. Many young people became habituated to living in solitary ways, she says, and were then thrust into social situations that may now seem much more frightening and overwhelming. “During the pandemic, my age group went back to the teenage house party because we couldn’t go out to clubs and bars, and it was good to rely on just each other to have fun. We knew how to socialise, but I was working with groups [for this production] who grew up in the pandemic and didn’t know how to behave in a social context; so 17-year-olds who have never been to their first house party, and who now feel really awkward … They remain the social age they were before the pandemic.” Abigail’s Party is at Watford Palace theatre until 2 April.

3/15/2022,"Michael Gove’s plan to permit UK householders to shelter Ukrainians seeking to escape the Russian war machine has been compared to a “DIY asylum scheme” after it was announced that people would have to name the refugees they wish to sponsor. The communities secretary was criticised after setting out details of the homes for Ukraine scheme in the Commons on Monday, after complaints about the government’s slow response to the worst humanitarian disaster in Europe for decades. The scheme will initially only facilitate sponsorship between people with known connections so it can be “up and running as soon as possible”, Gove told MPs. He added that it should “rapidly” expand by working with charities, faith and community groups. Lisa Nandy, the shadow communities secretary, raised concerns over matching Ukrainian families to sponsors and claimed the government was suggesting people should advertise on Instagram via a “DIY asylum scheme”. “On his [Gove’s] tour of the TV studios, he suggested several times that people who are willing to sponsor a Ukrainian family need to come to the government with the name of that family who will then rubber stamp it,” she said. “He can’t seriously be asking Ukrainian families who are fleeing Vladimir Putin, who have left their homes with nothing, to get on to Instagram and advertise themselves in the hope a British family might notice them. Is this genuinely the extent of this scheme?” she said. The details of the new scheme were unveiled after the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, became the first senior MP to say that he would apply, while No 10 said the prime minister would not for security reasons. The website accepting UK applicants appeared to crash on Monday afternoon, minutes after being launched. Britons will be able to apply to accept Ukrainians into their homes for a minimum of six months, and will be given £350 a month for doing so. They will be subjected to “light touch” vetting checks and checks from local authorities on the suitability of their homes. Sponsored Ukrainians will be granted three years’ leave to remain in the UK, with entitlement to work and access public services. Speaking in the Commons, Gove said the number of Ukrainians now arriving in the UK was “rapidly increasing”. “The scheme will allow Ukrainians with no family ties to the UK to be sponsored by individuals or organisations who can offer them a home. There will be no limit to the number of Ukrainians who can benefit from this scheme,” he said. Asked about safeguarding checks on UK applicants, he said: “We are working with the Home Office. We don’t believe we need to have full DBS checks in order to make sure that someone is an appropriate sponsor. “It will often be the case that very light-touch criminal checks will be sufficient and then local authorities can be supported in order to make sure that people are safe.” The government has already made changes to simplify the visa application scheme, Gove said. “We are moving as quickly as possible in order to ensure – working with NGOs and local government – that individuals in need can be found the families and sponsors whom they need in order to get people into this country as quickly as possible.” Gove said he was speaking to people in local government 10 days ago about the scheme, telling MPs additional funding was available to local authorities for school places and care. Nandy also questioned the government’s insistence that Ukrainians will have to fill in lengthy visa application forms. “We could keep essential checks but drop the excessive bureaucracy,” she said. The SNP’s home affairs spokesperson, Stuart McDonald, called for the government to “stop asking Ukrainians to apply for visas altogether”. Earlier, it emerged that the PM was unlikely to take any Ukrainian refugees into No 10 because of security concerns, but the transport secretary said he would apply to the new programme. Asked about Johnson, who lives in the flat above No 11 Downing Street with his wife, Carrie, and two of his children, the PM’s spokesman said: “There are specific challenges around security on housing people in No 10. “Various ministers have been asked about this. Obviously it will come down to individual circumstances. This is a significant commitment.” Shapps became the first senior MP to confirm he would register to host a Ukrainian refugee in his home. “We intend to apply today to join other UK households in offering our home to provide refuge to Ukrainians until it is safe for them to return to their country,” he tweeted. Around 4,000 visas have so far been granted through that route, the latest Home Office figures show. The Home Office has defended requiring security checks on Ukrainians fleeing Russia’s invasion, arguing that it must ensure the UK helps those in genuine need. The government has faced criticism – including from its own MPs – over the speed and scale of its response to the refugee crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. More than 2.5 million people have fled Ukraine as Russia continues its advance.The UN high commissioner for refugees has called it the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since the second world war and it is expected that the number could grow to 4 million people.",News/UK news,Labour calls UK’s homes for Ukraine plan a ‘DIY asylum scheme’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/14/labour-calls-uks-homes-for-ukraine-plan-a-diy-asylum-scheme
3/15/2022,"“Manchester United,” Diego Simeone said before falling silent, steel in his stare as he sat and waited for the next question. The Atlético Madrid manager had been asked about reports he was the coach Paris Saint-Germain had identified as the ideal candidate to take over after they were eliminated by Real Madrid in the last-16 of the Champions League but there was only one thing on his mind: not having the same fate befall his side. Their league title defence over almost before it began, the Champions League is all Atlético have left. A month ago, most expected that not to last very long either and for the first time there were questions about Simeone’s own future. But he said the significance of the club’ hierarchy backing him following a dreadful home defeat to Levante and, his authority re-established, they have won four league games in succession since. They also had the better of the first leg against United, a 1-1 draw in Madrid, cautious optimism returning. “It’s been one of the most complicated seasons we have since we have been here but we have had to find solutions as issues arise and see what we can do,” Simeone said, adding: “A bit like in this press room.” He said so because the microphone had failed but now it was working, a little like his team. If his side have not been outstanding lately, Atlético were fortunate to defeat relegation-threatened Cádiz on Friday, there has been a sense of recovering something of their old selves after an apparent identity crisis. “Everyone has their own opinion [about styles] and we all try to do the best we can for the club we’re at with the characteristics of the players we have,” Simeone said. “Over the last 10 years we found a path where the results followed. Our characteristics are that [intensity].” He suggested the counter-attacking approach that has served his team suits United too and suggested this meeting would not have a singular pattern. “Ninety minutes of pressing high are impossible, and you react depending on how the game unfolds. I imagine a dynamic game, alternating, [moments] for both sides, the kind you get in stadiums like this,” Simeone said. “At first, I imagine they will press us, there will be that vertigo that you get when you play at home. We also have the counter to take advantage of any mistakes they might make. “With the players they have and their characteristics, with the players we have, I think it will be a game that alternates. They have the counter too; it’s one of the greatest virtues, and one of ours. There could be long periods of possession but I don’t think so; that would be unusual for us and for them. We know their potential but we have confidence.” Atlético will be without Yannick Carrasco, who is suspended, and Daniel Wass, Thomas Lemar and Sime Vrsaljko all of whom are injured. Despite not training fully, Mario Hermoso, Josema Giménez and Geoffrey Kondogbia all travelled to Manchester. “We’ve had a plague of injuries; those who are in the best condition will play,” Simeone said.",Sport/Football,Diego Simeone keeps faith in Atlético’s old ways to beat Manchester United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/14/diego-simeone-keeps-faith-in-atleticos-old-ways-to-beat-manchester-united
3/15/2022,"A Fox News journalist has been injured outside Kyiv, the network reported on Monday. In a statement sent to its employees on Monday afternoon, Fox News said that its foreign affairs correspondent, Benjamin Hall, “was injured while newsgathering outside of Kyiv in Ukraine. We have a minimal level of details right now, but Ben is hospitalized and our teams on the ground are working to gather additional information as the situation quickly unfolds.” The report came after the Facebook page of Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Irina Venediktova, announced on Monday that a British journalist had been seriously wounded in Ukraine and was in “intensive care under the supervision of doctors”. “This man was not at a military facility, where according to Russian officials, they are constantly targeting. Not being at a military facility, he suffered serious injuries,” the post added. The information surrounding the case is being brought to Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau where it “will be properly investigated”, according to the prosecutor. Accompanying the post is a picture of congressional press accreditation that said “Radio & TV” and “Fox News”. The accreditation features an image of Hall in a suit with the date “3/31/2022” written underneath. “The safety of our entire team of journalists in Ukraine and the surrounding region is our top priority and of the utmost importance. This is a stark reminder for all journalists who are putting their lives on the line every day to deliver the news from a war zone,” Fox News said. On Sunday, Ukrainian authorities announced that Brent Renaud, an award-winning American film-maker, was killed by Russian forces in Irpin, a flashpoint town outside Kyiv. An American photographer, Juan Arredondo, was wounded. The 51-year old film-maker was shot in the neck and died shortly after coming under Russian fire, according to local police officials. Last week, a Sky News crew was evacuated from Ukraine and back to the UK after the team of five journalists was shot at by a suspected Russian “death squad”. The journalists were attacked while out in a car after they unsuccessfully tried to visit Bucha, a town near Kyiv. Stuart Ramsay, Sky News’s chief correspondent, was shot in the lower back, and camera operator Richie Mockler was shot twice in his body armour. The group was eventually able to escape from the car and found refuge in a nearby garage where they were later rescued by Ukrainian police.",News/Media,"Fox News journalist injured outside Kyiv, network says",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/14/fox-news-journalist-injured-kyiv
3/15/2022,"ARussian debt default, the first stage of which could arrive as soon as this week, sounds, in theory, like a major financial event. After all, the last time Russia defaulted – indeed, the only other time since the Bolshevik revolution more than a century ago – was 1998 and chaos was a genuine possibility. Long-Term Capital Management, an enormous and already-ailing hedge fund, couldn’t handle the explosion in volatility and the general flight to safety in financial markets. Within a few weeks, the US Federal Reserve had to strong-arm 14 Wall Street banks into agreeing a $3.6bn bailout of LTCM to prevent a wider meltdown. The Fed was probably right to fear contagion: LTCM was absurdly over-extended via leverage, and half of Wall Street was over-extended to it. Thankfully, no such equivalent excitement should follow if Russia goes ahead with its threat-cum-warning to pay investors from “hostile” countries in roubles when a $117m coupon on two dollar-denominated sovereign bonds falls due on Wednesday. Such an action would be a clear default, experts agree: if the bonds specify a payment currency, as they seem to do on this occasion, you can’t choose a different one. Once the 30-day grace period has expired, default becomes formal. From a contagion perspective though, size is the most important factor. Thinktank Capital Economics calculates that the overall size of Russian foreign currency sovereign debt held by non-residents is only about $20bn, which is not much in a global context. Even if one adds possible defaults to foreigners on domestic bonds, one only gets to $70bn. Argentina defaulted on slightly more in 2020 and didn’t cause a global financial earthquake. There are two possible risks around the generally relaxed view, adds Capital Economics, and neither can be ignored. First, a single bank or important institution could have an out-sized exposure to Russian sovereign bonds. Yes, concentration of risk also matters. It is a close cousin of correlated risks, which was what felled LTCM. Second, the stakes would become more serious if large Russian corporates, such as Gazprom and Rosneft, started defaulting; their external debts are about four times larger than the sovereign’s, says the thinktank. So far, there’s no sign of corporate defaults, but it must be a possible next move by Moscow as sanctions bite and a large portion of foreign reserves remain frozen. But we’re not there yet, and lenders cannot claim there’s no time to prepare. Last Friday British American Tobacco (BAT) reversed its decision to continue selling cigarettes and other nicotine products in Russia. That leaves Japan Tobacco International (JTI), whose brands include Camel, Winston, Silk Cut and Benson & Hedges, as the main outlier among big western tobacco firms. Japan Tobacco’s position is similar to the one BAT initially adopted before abandoning two days later. The Tokyo-based group said last Thursday that its JTI subsidiary will suspend new investment and marketing, but would carry on producing and distributing in Russia. Its market-leading Russian operation is big: four factories and 4,000 employees. There was, though, a hint that the company wasn’t entirely confident about sticking with Russia. “JTI cannot exclude the possibility of a suspension of its manufacturing operations in the country,” continued the statement. So far, however, a manufacturing suspension hasn’t happened, despite a passionate appeal by JTI employees in Ukraine for a stronger response. “Please do not make us feel ashamed of being part of the JTI One Team,” begged an open letter a fortnight ago. The moral case for tobacco companies exiting Russia is surely more compelling than for virtually any other industry. Cigarettes are almost the definition of a consumer inessential and excise duties go directly to Kremlin coffers. After BAT’s U-turn, JTI’s position looks untenable. What is it waiting for? The boffins at the Office for National Statistics, presumably clad in grim “smart separates”, have declared that the men’s suit is no longer a suitable product to help in the measurement of inflation. Doughnuts, oddly, have also got the chop from the basket of representative goods; apparently, we’re feasting on multi-packs of cakes these days. The death of the doughnut is no great loss, but it’s hard to believe the men’s suit will go without a fight once working-from-home effects fade. Think of the suit’s return to the ONS basket as an unofficial marker of the economy’s recovery to post-Covid normality.

3/15/2022,"Groups interested in buying Chelsea from Roman Abramovich are rushing to ensure their takeover proposals are ready before the deadline to submit bids for the club arrives. The Raine Group, the US bank tasked with handling the sale, have given potential bidders until Friday to make their offers and want the process to run smoothly given that delays could increase the chance of Chelsea falling into major financial trouble. Chelsea, who are in a state of limbo after Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government, fear that they could go into administration if there is no change of ownership soon. Raine remain hopeful that a deal could go through by the end of this month and, with time of the essence, bidders have been given a chance to look at the club’s latest set of accounts and wage bill. Groups who are serious about buying Chelsea are already doing due diligence before finalising their offers. It is understood that as many as 200 groups have expressed an interest in doing a deal but Raine are conscious of the need to move quickly. Chelsea are operating under a restrictive special licence as a result of the sanctions imposed on Abramovich and they are desperate to avoid delays, particularly as any deal requires final approval from the government. Bidders are being told that they will need to offer legal guarantees that they have enough funds to complete a deal. A consortium led by Hansjörg Wyss, Todd Boehly and Jonathan Goldstein have already submitted an offer in the region of £2bn and are waiting to hear whether they will be successful. There is also interest from Woody Johnson, the owner of the New York Jets, and the Ricketts family, who own the Chicago Cubs. However the British property tycoon Nick Candy needs to move quickly if is he to meet Raine’s deadline. Candy is planning to bid, but he is still working on finalising his consortium. Sources close to the 49-year-old, who attended Chelsea’s win over Newcastle on Sunday, have said that he has been approached by a number of investors and that he will not struggle to raise enough capital. There have been claims that the Saudi Media Group, who are interested in buying Chelsea, have submitted an offer of £2.7bn. The company is headed by Mohamed Alkhereiji and sources insist that the group has no links to the government of Saudi Arabia. It remains to be seen if a bid from a Saudi company would be waved through quickly by the government and the Premier League. One source told the Guardian that a deal remains a long way off. Chelsea have told supporters that they are pushing the government to amend their operating licence to allow them to sell tickets. Fans who had not already done so by last Thursday are still waiting to find out if they can buy a ticket for Saturday’s FA Cup quarter-final against Middlesbrough. The club said: “We are pressing the government to allow our supporters to have access to tickets. Meetings are taking place daily in search of a resolution. In addition, the Premier League and FA are also discussing with the government the sporting integrity issues raised if they do not permit fans to attend.” Chelsea fans have been urged to stop the “completely inappropriate” chanting of Abramovich’s name, the prime minister’s spokesman has said. Supporters expressed their backing for the Russian during the win over Newcastle.",Sport/Football,Potential Chelsea owners in rush to finalise offers after Friday deadline set,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/14/potential-chelsea-owners-in-rush-to-finalise-offers-after-friday-deadline-set
3/15/2022,"The Morrison government has announced it will remove the need for developments in some areas to receive project-specific approval under national environment laws, in a step conservationists fear will further weaken nature protection. Guardian Australia revealed last month that the government was considering using a little known section of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to allow some developments to be given the green light as part of a regional plan without consideration of the impact of the project itself. In a joint statement released on Monday night, the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, and the resources minister, Keith Pitt, said the March budget would include $62.3m to establish these plans in up to 10 priority areas, emphasising it could speed up approval for mining developments. “The 10 new regional plans will streamline development approvals, including those for crucial resources projects, by removing the need for a project-by-project approval under national environment law,” Pitt said in the statement. The ministers did not say which areas the regional plans would cover. The decision depends on parts of the EPBC Act that gives only a vague definition of a regional plan as covering a broad range of biodiversity, social and economic factors, and grants the environment minister the power to declare some development activities exempt from needing federal approval where those projects are covered by plan. Regional plans have previously been used only in marine areas. Documents obtained last month by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws showed the government was exploring whether it could use the act bypass the need for individual projects to seek federal environmental approval. It was proposed as an alternative to the government passing new laws to transfer more environmental decision-making powers from the commonwealth to state and territory governments. Legislation to allow that change has been blocked by the Senate since last year. Ley and Pitt said an $128.5m package to “advance environmental law reform” would be included in the budget. In addition to support for regional plans, it would include $37.9m for “streamlining of assessment processes”, $12m to “modernise the environmental offsets policy” and $9.5m to improve compliance with the law. Ley’s office could not provide details on what the modernising of environmental offsets policy would entail but is likely to be initially be used for a review. Guardian Australia has reported extensively on flaws in offset schemes, including offset commitments that were never delivered and problems with the federal government’s offset for the development western Sydney airport. The minister said there would also be $4.9m to “strengthen our knowledge base of protected plants and animals’” and $2m to “scope a new advisory committee to provide expert industry and technology advice to government”. She said it represented “another important step in delivering much needed environmental reform that reduces unnecessary delay and duplication, while strengthening safeguards”. A review of the EPBC Act led by the former competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel last year found the environment was suffering from two decades of failure by governments to improve protection and called for an overhaul of Australia’s conservation laws to address a “trajectory of environmental decline”. The Coalition is yet to formally respond to his review. Its attempt to introduce legislation that would allow states and territories to take more responsibility for environmental decisions failed to gain parliamentary support in part because the government did not adopt a recommendation by Samuel for a set of new national environmental standards against which developments should be tested. The Senate rejected a weaker set of standards proposed by the government. Alexia Wellbelove, a campaign manager at Humane Society International, said without the introduction of strong national standards the government’s new regional plans policy were unlikely to benefit the environment. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “In fact, they may do the reverse,” she said. “Speeding up decisions on environmental approvals and putting a focus on facilitating development is putting our heads in the sand on the extinction crisis.” Wellbelove said substantial additional funding should be directed to helping a growing list of national threatened species. “This package does nothing to address the crisis they face,” she said. “The funding is solely about speeding up decisions that will impact the environment when instead we should be directing this funding towards recovering threatened species and their habitats.”",News/Australia news,"Coalition to allow some projects, including mining, to bypass federal environmental approvals ",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/15/coalition-to-allow-some-mining-projects-to-bypass-federal-environmental-approvals
3/15/2022,"The United States has held “intense” high-level talks with China in an effort to try to dissuade Beijing from supplying arms to Russia, at a meeting in Rome which the White House sees as critically important not just for the war in Ukraine but also for the future of the global balance of power. Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser, met his Chinese counterpart, Yang Jiechi, for all-day talks in the Italian capital on Monday amid reports that Russia has asked China for weapons to bolster its faltering invasion of Ukraine. “It was an intense seven-hour session, reflecting the gravity of the moment, as well as our commitment to maintaining open lines of communication,” a senior administration official said. “This meeting was not about negotiating specific issues or outcomes, but about a candid direct exchange of views.” Asked if it had been successful, the official replied: “I suppose it depends on how you define success, but we believe that it is important to keep open lines of communication between the United States and China, especially on areas where we disagree.” The official would not describe the Chinese response to US arguments in Rome, nor comment on reports that the US had briefed allies on Monday, before the meeting, that Beijing had shown willingness to provide military assistance to Russia. The Rome meeting had been planned since before the Russian invasion, and covered other topics, including North Korea’s nuclear arsenal and Taiwan. China reacted angrily to the reports in multiple media outlets citing US officials. Its foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said the US was spreading “malicious disinformation”, with “sinister intentions”, according to translations by journalists in the room. “China’s position on the Ukraine issue is consistent and clear, and China has been playing a constructive role in promoting peace talks,” Zhao said. “It is imperative that all parties exercise restraint and cool down tensions, not add fuel to the fire.” Sullivan had planned to point out in the Rome meeting that the US briefed Beijing on Vladimir Putin’s intentions months ahead of the invasion, but that the Chinese leadership ignored those warnings, mistakenly believing that Putin was bluffing to gain leverage, according to sources familiar with plans for the Rome meeting. Sullivan was also to argue that if China supplies weapons to Moscow it would be a further, historic mistake, and a turning point in global politics. The Biden White House is anxious to prevent the Ukraine war further cementing a division of the world into two opposing blocs. Sullivan and Yang had also been expected to follow up on agreements Joe Biden and Xi Jinping made in a virtual summit in November, to improve crisis communications between the two nuclear powers. “We also are watching closely to see the extent to which China actually does provide any form of support – material support or economic support – to Russia,” Sullivan told CNN. “It is a concern of ours. And we have communicated to Beijing that we will not stand by and allow any country to compensate Russia for its losses from the economic sanctions.” Sullivan said the US had made clear to Beijing that there would “absolutely be consequences” for “large-scale” efforts to help Russia sidestep sanctions. Russia has also asked China for economic help as it faces severe western sanctions, but Sullivan told CNN the US was “communicating directly, privately to Beijing that there will absolutely be consequences” if China helps Russia evade sanctions. The Financial Times, New York Times and Washington Post reported on Sunday about the Russian request for weapons, amid claims from US officials that the Russian military was running short on certain kinds of armaments and had been seeking weapons from Beijing for some time. The spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, told CNN he had “never heard” of the Russian arms requests. “The current situation in Ukraine is indeed disconcerting,” he said in a statement. “The high priority now is to prevent the tense situation from escalating or even getting out of control.” “It feels like the US-China relationship is moving toward a pretty significant fork,” Ryan Hass, former China director at the US national security council, said on Twitter. “If China materially contributes to Russia’s war machine in Ukraine through provision of materiel or significant backfilling, then China’s actions will accelerate the cleavage of the world in direction of adversarial blocs. “It’s wise for the US to speak directly and privately with the Chinese at an authoritative level now to clarify the lasting strategic ramifications of China’s decisions in this moment.” China has so far not condemned the Russian invasion or the mass killings of civilians in bombardments of Ukrainian towns, and has abstained on resolutions deploring the attack at the UN security council and general assembly. Xi last week called for “maximum restraint” in Ukraine after a virtual meeting with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and French president, Emmanuel Macron, and said he was “pained to see the flames of war reignited in Europe”. Xi also expressed concern about the impact of sanctions on the global economy, and the limitation that western sanctions are imposing on China’s ability to buy Russian oil. Hass, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said he did not expect to see any immediate breakthroughs at the Rome meeting. “The results may take weeks or longer to come into focus,” he said. “Neither side is likely to provide other with satisfaction. Outcomes may need to be measured in degrees, not black-white binaries.” Wen-ti Sung, a political scientist at the Australian National University, said he believed the chance that China would supply weapons to Russia was “small”. “Doing it would be both too late to help the distant war in Ukraine, and would look very bad for Beijing. It’s not worth it,” he said. However, Sung said the US’s public airing of Russia’s requests – which were still of real concern – also allowed it to pressure Beijing on its civilian trade with Russia, which could include non-military parts and components which could be used in weapons production. “By flagging the possibility of Chinese providing military aid, Washington actually is laying down talking points to nudge China into limiting ‘civilian trading relationship’ with Russia and semi-joining (however partially) the international economic sanctions against Russia,” Sung said. “If it works, it will reduce China-Russia trade and further weaken Russia; if it doesn’t, it will help shore up the ‘China is Russia’s enabler’ image, and claim moral high ground for the US vis-a-vis China.” Professor Steve Tsang, director of the Soas China Institute, said Xi would not want to put China’s economy at risk during a year when his top priority is securing a third term. “China under Xi will give whatever support it can to help Putin but it will not allow itself to suffer from secondary sanctions as it does so, despite the [agreement] of ‘rock solid’ support and a friendship ‘without limits’,” he said.",News/World news,US urged China not to supply arms to Russia at ‘intense’ Rome meeting,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/us-will-try-to-convince-china-not-to-supply-arms-to-russia-at-key-rome-meeting
3/15/2022,"Russian forces have kept up their relentless bombardment of Ukraine’s major cities as the number of people fleeing the country neared 3 million, with the Red Cross describing conditions for those left behind as “nothing short of a nightmare”. As Russian airstrikes and artillery fire continued to pound residential areas across the country, Ukrainian prosecutors said 90 children had now died in the conflict. The UN said it had confirmed 636 civilian deaths, but the real toll would be much higher. UN data also showed that more than 2.8 million civilians had fled the onslaught since it began on 24 February, with millions more internally displaced. EU officials have said 5 million people may end up fleeing abroad and others have put the figure higher. Multiple airstrikes again hit residential buildings in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and second city of Kharkiv on Monday, killing at least three people and wounding dozens more, authorities said. One body was recovered and three people were hospitalised after a missile partially destroyed a nine-storey block of flats in Kyiv’s Obolon district, local officials said, with a second person killed later by falling missile fragments on a nearby street. In Kharkiv, two people were killed by artillery fire on a residential street and a 15-year-old boy died from shrapnel wounds after shells hit a kindergarten in the nearby town of Chuguiv, approximately 25 miles (40km) south-east of the city. At least nine people were also reportedly killed and nine more wounded in an air strike on a television tower in Ukraine’s northern Rivne region. “There are still people under the rubble,” governor Vitaliy Koval said. Some civilians were able to flee, with frontline towns around Kyiv being partially – if slowly – evacuated for a fifth consecutive day, according to the regional governor, Oleksiy Kuleba, who added that a ceasefire to allow civilians to leave was “holding, albeit it is very conditional”. A senior official in President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office said more than 1,700 people had also been evacuated through humanitarian corridors in the eastern region of Luhansk, despite what Ukrainian authorities described as constant fire. After several days of failed attempts to deliver supplies to Mariupol and provide safe passage out for trapped civilians, authorities said a local ceasefire was holding, with more than 160 private cars able to leave in what appeared to be the first successful attempt to evacuate civilians from the encircled and devastated city. Andrei Rempel, a city council representative, said the southern port “continues to be bombed, but this road is not being shelled.” The council described the situation in Mariupol on Friday as “critical”, while the Red Cross has said conditions there were “apocalyptic”. A Ukrainian presidential adviser, Oleksiy Arestovych, said more than 2,500 residents of the Black Sea city, many of whose residents have been without power, heat or water for more than two weeks, had died since the invasion began on 24 February. Robert Mardini, director-general of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said the war had become “nothing short of a nightmare” for those living in such besieged cities. “The situation cannot, cannot continue like this,” he said. “History is watching what is happening in Mariupol and other cities.” Some of those who have decided to stay in Kyiv said they were doing so because they were determined to help with their country’s defence. “The sirens are going constantly, but one basically ignores them at this point,” said Maria Koudriavtseva, 37, a former marketing manager who is now a volunteer helping to make body armour and tank traps for the army. “As we made the decision to stay and help the army until the end, we are staying and doing what we can,” she said. We’re in the centre and it’s relatively quiet. There are cars, the traffic lights are working,” she said. “But as you know there were serious attacks on Obolon and Kurenivka.”Oleksandr Tanashchuk, a paramedic, said that for him “the situation hasn’t changed in the past week or so”. Tanaschuk said most people who wanted to leave had now done so and and those who have stayed had made their choice. “Either they are people who are active, like us, or people who can’t leave, or people who are like children, closing their eyes to the danger,” he said, adding that he believed Ukraine’s troops would be able to hold off the coming assault. The Russian force’s resources were becoming depleted, he said, and their morale was falling. A close ally of Russian president Vladimir Putin, national guard chief Viktor Zolotov, admitted on Monday that Russia’s military operation in Ukraine had not gone as quickly as the Kremlin had wanted, blaming the lack of progress on what he said were far-right Ukrainian forces hiding behind civilians, an accusation repeatedly made by Russian officials. Zolotov was contradicted by Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, however, who said the invasion was “going according to plan and will be completed on time and in full”, adding: “The defence ministry of the Russian Federation, while ensuring the maximum safety of the civilian population, does not exclude the possibility of taking major population centres under full control.” Ukrainian authorities, meanwhile, denied Russian accusations that a Ukrainian missile in separatist-controlled Donetsk killed 20 people. The local separatist leader, Denis Pushilin, said the victims were waiting at a bus stop and an ATM. Ukrainian military spokesman Leonid Matyukhin, however, denied the allegation, saying the missile was Russian. “It is unmistakably a Russian rocket or another munition, there’s not even any point talking about it,” he said. Peace talks between the two sides resumed on Monday, with Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak stating they would continue on Tuesday via video after a “technical pause” to allow additional work by subgroups and clarification of terms. While previous rounds had focused on humanitarion issues, the latest talks were aimed at achieving a ceasefire, securing Russian troop withdrawals and establishing security guarantees for Ukraine, Podolyak said, describing negotiations as “hard”. Both sides had earlier reported progress, with Ukraine saying Russia was “beginning to talk constructively” and results might be possible “literally in a matter of days”. Russian delegate Leonid Slutsky suggested draft agreements may not be far off. Zelenskiy said one aim was to set up a meeting between himself and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, with the ultimate goal of “Ukraine getting the necessary result for peace and for security”, but Russia said it had received no formal request for a meeting. Washington and its EU allies have sent funds and military aid to Ukraine and imposed unprecedented economic sanctions on Russia, but ruled out any direct intervention, with the US president, Joe Biden, saying Nato fighting Russia “is world war three”. The west has imposed sanctions on Russian billionaire oligarchs close to Putin, frozen Russian state assets and cut off much of the country’s corporate sector from the global economy in an attempt to force Moscow to change course. Russia warned on Monday that while it had approved a temporary procedure for repaying its foreign currency debt, payments would be made in roubles if sanctions prevented banks from honouring debts in the currency of issue. Several US officials have said Russia has also asked China for military equipment. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, who was due to meet China’s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, in Rome on Monday, said China would “absolutely” face consequences if it helped Moscow evade western sanctions. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said US assertions that Russia asked Beijing for military equipment for its campaign in Ukraine were “disinformation” from the US, while the Kremlin said Russia had sufficient military resources to fulfil its aims without any need for help from China. The UN secretary-general, António Guterres, said on Monday that an earlier decision by Putin to place Russia’s nuclear forces on higher alert was a “bone-chilling development”, adding that the once-unthinkable prospect of nuclear conflict “is now back within the realm of possibility”.",News/World news,Russia keeps up pounding of Ukrainian cities amid ‘nightmare’ for civilians,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/russia-ukraine-kyiv-air-strike-hostomel
3/15/2022,"Hopes are high that a fabled medieval town known as “Yorkshire’s Atlantis” is about to be located and will begin giving up secrets held for more than 650 years. Ravenser Odd was a prosperous port town built on sandbanks at the mouth of the Humber estuary before it was abandoned and later destroyed and submerged by a calamitous storm in 1362. Daniel Parsons, a professor in sedimentology at the University of Hull, was on a family day out to the seaside at Withernsea when he learned about Ravenser Odd, one of the biggest of a number of places on the Holderness coast that have been lost over the centuries due to coastal erosion. He got chatting to the historian Phil Mathison. “He was telling me that at low tide local lobster vessels have seen disturbances on the surface suggesting there are actual remnants of the town on the seabed.” He started reading more about the fascinating history of Ravenser Odd and the idea started to form. Parsons is a geoscientist who uses high-resolution sonar systems to better understand how sediments move around. Could, he asked himself, the equipment be used to find this lost Atlantis, and could the story be used to shine light on the coastal erosion threat faced by communities today? Money was raised for a research project which resulted in a survey of an area off Spurn Point of about 10 hectares last year. It did not locate Ravenser Odd, but they were close, Parsons believes, and a second survey will take place in two to three weeks’ time. “We think we were a little bit too far to the east,” he said. “Given the stories we’ve had from the folks on the lobster vessels, I’m pretty confident we will find something.” Once it is located, it is hoped that money can be raised for archaeological exploration – and who knows what may then be found, Parsons said. Ravenser Odd was founded around 1235 with its name stemming from the Old Norse hrafn’s eyr (raven’s tongue). It became a town of national importance with wharves, warehouses, a court and a prison. It had two members of parliament and collected dues from more than 100 merchant ships a year. It also had a seawall and a harbour. “Those things aren’t easily washed away,” said Parsons. “Having looked at historic sites and places that have been lost in a similar way, such as in the Bay of Naples, what you tend to find is that the foundations of these settlements are still there.” Coastal erosion brought about the town’s decline and it was flooded by the middle of the 14th century. In 1362, northern Europe was hit by a terrible storm called the Grote Mandrenke storm, or Saint Marcellus’s flood, which led to the town being completely submerged in the cold waters of the North Sea. Parsons is director of the university’s energy and environment institute and thinks the story of Ravenser Odd could be used to engage with people about the dangers posed by the climate crisis and coastal erosion, particularly given the Holderness coast is one of the most rapidly eroding coastlines in the world with some areas retreating up to 10 metres a year. “Understanding the past helps us prepare better in the future,” he said. “Ravenser Odd is an incredibly evocative story of the impacts of coastal change on entire settlements. “I think it is a fantastic way to start conversations with people on the impacts of climate change long in to the future by using these stories from the past.”",News/UK news,"Yorkshire’s lost ‘Atlantis’ nearly found, says Hull professor",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/14/yorkshires-lost-atlantis-nearly-found-says-hull-professor
3/15/2022,"Through a new government scheme, people in the UK will be able to house refugees fleeing Ukraine who have been granted a visa. So far, 4,000 visas have been issued to Ukrainians with family in the UK. The government, which has been criticised for its slow response to the Ukrainian humanitarian crisis, expects to provide “tens of thousands” more, according to the levelling up secretary, Michael Gove. Three Britons who are thinking about offering to house Ukrainian refugees speak about why they are taking the step and what challenges they may encounter. Jo Cooksey, a 56-year-old civil servant in Tameside, Greater Manchester, has been thinking about opening her home to refugees since people started fleeing Ukraine. “I can’t just sit by and watch this horror unfolding,” Cooksey says. “The Polish have been amazing, the way they’ve just opened the border and taken everybody who wants to go, but, obviously, Poland can’t sustain that. I thought maybe there was a chance that we would be able to help. I would like to think that somebody would do the same for me, you know?” The 56-year-old, who has had a spare room since her daughter moved out, says she “would offer [her] home to a woman with a child or an elderly person” for “as long as it takes”. The homes for Ukraine programme asks people to commit to providing housing for a minimum of six months. “At the moment, we just have no idea about what’s going to happen,” she says. “It’s a big leap of faith to offer a home to a stranger. You’re not going to know this person, and you won’t know anything about their background until you meet them. However, that won’t put me off trying to help.” Kyleen Kelly, 37, a part-time dental receptionist in Taunton, Somerset, has already donated money and items to local collections for Ukraine, but says she wants to keep helping refugees in whatever way she can. “I’ve got three children and I can’t imagine what they’re going through. It just breaks my heart every time I see women and children having to leave their fathers and their uncles and their grandfathers behind because they’re still fighting, and their homes being ruined and have to leave with nothing,” she says. Kelly and her partner live with their children in a four-bedroom house, and plan to move two of the kids into one room to make space for another family. “I’ve got a double bed and a travel cot and a camp bed, so I’ve got enough room to take three or four people. We’ve got a garden and a big enough dining room that they can sit and have dinner with us, and things like that, if they wanted to. My kids are all up for it. They’re all aware of what’s happening, so they’re happy to help.” She says she doesn’t know what kind of challenges hosting a family may involve, but is ready to take each one as it comes. “If they don’t speak much English, we’ll use the internet to translate. It’s just a case of going with it. I know they’re not going to feel at home. I just want to give them a little bit of kindness.” Theresa Sullivan, a 55-year-old nurse in Greater London, said she and her husband decided they would offer to house refugees “the minute [they] heard” it would be possible. Sullivan, who volunteers at a food bank that supports asylum seekers, had hoped to open her home to Syrian refugees but had been disappointed with the lack of government support. “We hoped that something like this was going to be set up back then – it was so frustrating to watch everything that was happening and not be able to do anything for those refugees and know how bad the plight was. Maybe we can help with this crisis, at least, if we really weren’t there for the Syrians.” While Sullivan has some experience working with asylum seekers in the UK, she has never offered accommodation to people she doesn’t know. “It’s a choice I’m glad I have and can make. I’m sure it won’t be that easy for either of us. But that’s part of the challenge,” she says. “I think it is scary for people to think about doing this and there are risks … but you’ve got to accept all that and just hope you can bring good about despite it. It’s not a reason not to try to do good.” Ben Fielding, 65, is already in touch with a Ukrainian family who are trying to reach the UK, and is ready to share his home in Kent with them. “My son, who’s in the RAF, has reached out to a Ukrainian he knows to offer sanctuary to his wife and children while he remains in Ukraine to join the military,” he says. The family are still in Ukraine but are hoping to reach Poland in the next few days and, from there, travel to the UK. However, the portal for visa applications is not set to go live until Friday, and Fielding worries that the government is not acting quickly enough. “What families like these need is certainty that they will be allowed to travel to the UK and to be able to stay with us,” he says, adding that while he understands that such schemes take time to organise: “This family do not have this time.” “It seems to me that the UK government is fiddling while Ukraine burns and innocent women and children suffer. Those fleeing the war need certainty now, so they can make plans while there is still time.”",News/World news,‘Those fleeing war need certainty’: the UK residents hoping to house refugees,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/those-fleeing-war-need-certainty-the-uk-residents-hoping-to-house-refugees
3/15/2022,"Two RSPCA animal welfare experts have left the organisation to campaign for a national independent animal welfare commission, saying the current regulatory structure is “broken”. Dr Bidda Jones stepped down as chief scientific officer at RSPCA Australia in late 2021, after 25 years. Dr Jed Goodfellow stepped down as a senior policy officer in October. On Tuesday they launched the Australian Alliance for Animals, co-founded with Dr Meg Good, an animal rights lawyer and senior program manager at Voiceless. They are calling for the formation of an independent national animal welfare commission, a reform which was recommended by the productivity commission in 2017 and has been long campaigned for by the RSPCA. An independent commission could develop minimum standards without interference, in the same way that Food Standards Australia New Zealand does. That would improve both the lives of farm animals in Australia and Australia’s standing in global animal welfare rankings, Jones said. “What is the minimum standard is what most animals will be subjected to,” Jones said. “You will only get changes to affect the majority of animals if you mandate it.” Jones said she and Goodfellow had separately become frustrated facing the same roadblocks again and again when campaigning for welfare reform during their work at RSPCA Australia. Some campaigns they worked on, such as the push to ban battery eggs, have stalled for years after getting snarled in byzantine bureaucratic processes. “The frustrations over time have just piled up,” Jones says. “While within the RSPCA or other groups who were just focusing on trying to get change on specific issues, we weren’t able to dedicate the time to deal with that fundamental policy framework system issue. So we just got to the point where, separately, we both kind of thought we need to do something more about this.” The drafting of the new Australian Animal Welfare Standards and Guidelines for Poultry began seven years ago. A draft was sent out for consultation last year. It is still not finalised, and internal documents have revealed that one state may go against the recommendation to phase out battery hens by 2036 because of pressure from industry groups. “Seven years to develop a document that is basically saying this is how poultry should be farmed in Australia,” Jones said. “It is absolutely ridiculous that it should take that time.” It is not the only reform on the books: the draft guidelines and standards for abattoirs were produced 10 years ago and have not been progressed, and the minimum standards for pig welfare have not progressed past a literature review in 2018. A draft of the national minimum welfare standards for horses was completed in 2009 and has sat on the shelf. Adopting those standards was a key recommendation of a high-level report completed by the thoroughbred industry late last year. The slow pace of reform has left Australia out of step with contemporary countries on the welfare of farm animals. Animal welfare and farming groups in the UK urged their government not to sign a free trade deal with Australia because it would allow for the import of animal products farmed using practices which are illegal in the UK. The UK banned the use of sow stalls in 1999, battery cages for chickens in 2012, and prohibits mulesing. Australia still allows the use of sow stalls, despite a voluntary push from the industry to phase them out, and while the sheep industry recommends the use of pain relief when mulesing, Victoria is the only state to legally require it. “It’s very likely that the same conditions will end up in the European Union free trade agreement as well,” Jones said. “It’s definitely in the interests of industry here to be seen to be improving and to have a system that works to improve welfare across the board.” Goodfellow said laws and regulations in Australia had not kept pace with community expectations. “The system used to create animal welfare policy in Australia is broken,” he said. “Millions of Australians care about animal welfare but their views are not getting through to our political leaders.” Labor supported the formation of an independent animal welfare commission ahead of the 2019 election, and it is also backed by the Australian Greens. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Jones said the difficulties with reforming animal welfare in Australia were “bigger than any one organisation” and that while organisations like the RSPCA were quite rightly focusing on responding to urgent issues and dealing with the care, protection and rehoming of animals, there were very few resources for structural reform. “We felt that there needed to be an organisation that would be very, very focused on those structural issues and wouldn’t be distracted, lose that focus and [get] dragged down into the weeds,” she said. The alliance will serve as a joint lobby group for Australian animal welfare organisations, with Animals Australia, Compassion in World Farming, FOUR PAWS Australia, Humane Society International Australia, World Animal Protection Australia and Voiceless signing on as core members. It is funded by grants from those member organisations and some philanthropic donations. RSPCA Australia is not a core member but may support campaigns which align with its existing priorities.",News/World news,Former senior RSPCA officers launch campaign to repair ‘broken’ animal welfare system,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/former-senior-rspca-officers-launch-campaign-to-repair-broken-animal-welfare-system
3/15/2022,"Sleeping with the light on might scare away monsters under the bed, but it could be linked to an increased risk of heart disease and diabetes, research suggests. Light is an important signal by which the body’s internal clock, which governs a host of biological processes from temperature to hormone release, is synchronised to the external cycle of day and night. A number of studies have revealed, however, that keeping the lights on at night could be problematic. Among them, research has suggested it is associated with obesity in women and type 2 diabetes among elderly people, while a recent study from researchers in the Netherlands suggested bright daytime lighting and low light at night could help people with pre-diabetes control their blood sugar levels. Now researchers in the US say they have found that people who are exposed to artificial light at night show worse glucose and cardiovascular regulation compared with those who slumbered in the dark, something they suggest is down to the body being kept more alert. “We found that light – even [a] modest amount – increases activation of the autonomic nervous system, which we postulate increased heart rate and decreased insulin sensitivity,” said Dr Phyllis Zee, co-author of the study from Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Zee and colleagues report how they studied the glucose tolerance and heart rate of 20 people over two nights, 10 of whom spent both nights sleeping in dim light, while the other 10 spent one night in a room with dim light and the next night in a room with overhead lighting at around 100 lux, which is about equivalent to an overcast day. The results suggest that while levels of melatonin – a sleep-promoting hormone produced by the body – was similar in both groups, the group that spent a night with the lights on had higher insulin resistance in the morning, higher heart rate and lower heart-rate variability. “Because we only studied one night and in a healthy group, we are unable to say if these are clinically significant,” said Zee. “However the change in insulin would be considered a physiologically significant change that may translate into risk for disease.” Prof Jonathan Cedernaes from Uppsala University in Sweden, who was not involved in the research, said it was not surprising that light during sleep could have such effects, although he cautioned the new study was small and warranted confirmation in other cohorts and other conditions. “Light is the strongest signal to our circadian pacemaker that controls rhythms in physiology and behaviour, including in metabolism,” he said, adding the team behind the new study have previously shown blue-enriched light may have a specific impact on our metabolism. Cedernaes said people should try to have a sleeping environment that is as dark as possible – particularly for those doing shift work. Prof Russell Foster, director of the Sir Jules Thorn Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at the University of Oxford, also said the findings reinforced advice that darkness during sleep is important. “This is a very interesting study, and although the numbers are fairly small and the mechanisms not fully understood, the findings are consistent with previous observations that light at night can increase physiological alertness, reduce deep sleep and increase the release of stress hormones via the sympathetic nervous system. Together, these will act to increase insulin resistance,” he said. Foster added that the study points the way for larger scale trials over multiple nights, adding it would also be interesting to see if the results held in older individuals. “It would be interesting to see if this is an acute effect of one night of light exposure, or whether metabolic effects accumulate or decline over time,” he said. “Perhaps some individuals might even adapt to night-time light exposure over time.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Sleeping with light on linked to higher risk of heart disease and diabetes,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/14/sleeping-with-light-on-linked-to-higher-risk-of-heart-disease-and-diabetes
3/15/2022,"A detainee at a secret CIA detention site in Afghanistan was used as a living prop to teach trainee interrogators, who lined up to take turns at knocking his head against a plywood wall, leaving him with brain damage, according to a US government report. The details of the torture of Ammar al-Baluchi are in a 2008 report by the CIA’s inspector general, newly declassified as part of a court filing by his lawyers aimed at getting him an independent medical examination. Baluchi, a 44-year-old Kuwaiti, is one of five defendants before a military tribunal on Guantánamo Bay charged with participation in the 9/11 plot, but the case has been in pre-trial hearings for 10 years, mired in a dispute over legal admissibility of testimony obtained after torture. According to the inspector general’s report, the CIA was aware that the 2003 rendition of the detainee, Ammar al-Baluchi, from Pakistani custody to the “black site” north of Kabul was conducted “extra-legally”, because at the time he was in Pakistani jurisdiction and no longer represented a terrorist threat. The report said that interrogators at the site, known both as Cobalt and the Salt Pit, went beyond the CIA’s guidelines in torturing Baluchi, using two techniques without approval: using a stick behind his knees in stress position that involved leaning back while kneeling, and dousing with ice-cold water. The technique of “walling” was approved by the “enhanced interrogation technique” guidelines sent by CIA headquarters. It involved placing the detainee’s heels against a specially designed plywood wall “which had flexibility to it” and putting a rolled up towel around the detainee’s neck. “The interrogators would then grab the ends of the towel in front of and below the detainees face and shove [Baluchi] backwards into the wall, never letting go of the towel,” the report said. One of the interrogators (identified only by a code) said the goal was to “bounce” the detainee off the wall. The report noted that Baluchi was “naked for the proceedings”. There was no time limit for the “walling” sessions but “typically a session did not last for more than two hours at a time”. They went on for so long because Baluchi was being used as a teaching prop. One former trainee told investigators “all the interrogation students lined up to ‘wall’ Ammar so that [the instructor] could certify them on their ability to use the technique.” The report said that: “In the case of ‘walling’ in particular the [Office of the Inspector General] had difficulty determining whether the session was designed to elicit information from Ammar or to ensure that all interrogator trainees received their certification.” The fact that interrogators lined up to “wall” Ammar suggested that “certification was key”, the report concluded. A neuropsychologist carried out an MRI of Baluchi’s head in late 2018 and found “abnormalities indicating moderate to severe brain damage” in parts of his brain, affecting memory formation and retrieval as well as behavioral regulation. The specialist found that the “abnormalities observed were consistent with traumatic brain injury”. The inspector general’s report also concluded that Baluchi’s treatment did not yield any useful intelligence. It noted that the interrogators at Cobalt “focused more on whether Ammar was ‘compliant’ than on the quality of the information he was providing”. It called the CIA’s logic in justifying the detention “fuzzy and circular”. “Ammar fabricated the information he provided when undergoing EITs,” it said. “He later admitted to his interrogators/debriefers that he was terrified and lied to get agency officers to stop the measures … Ammar also explained that he was afraid to tell a lie and was afraid to tell the truth because he did not know how either would be received.” The interrogators were convinced that Baluchi knew more than he was saying because he was a nephew of the self-proclaimed mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, Khaled Sheikh Mohammed. Baluchi spent more than three years in CIA custody, moved between a total of six “black sites” before being transferred in 2006 to Guantánamo Bay, where he is still awaiting trial. Alka Pradhan, one of his lawyers said: “If the CIA had not hidden their own conclusions about the illegality of Omar’s torture for this long, the US government would not have been able to bring charges against Ammar because we now know that the torture inflicted on Ammar led to lasting brain damage in the form of a traumatic brain injury and other debilitating illnesses that cannot be treated at Guantánamo Bay.”",News/Law,CIA black site detainee served as training prop to teach interrogators torture techniques,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/mar/14/cia-black-site-detainee-training-prop-torture-techniques
3/15/2022,"Julian Assange has moved a step closer to a US trial on espionage charges after the UK’s highest court refused to hear his appeal against extradition. The WikiLeaks founder was attempting to appeal against a judgment by the high court in December that ruled he could be extradited after assurances from the US authorities with regard to his prison conditions there. The supreme court said on Monday that it had refused permission to appeal “as the application didn’t raise an arguable point of law”. After the decision, the case is expected to be formally sent to Priti Patel to approve the extradition. Assange’s lawyers will have four weeks to make submissions to the home secretary before her decision. There also remain other routes to fight his extradition, for instance by mounting a challenge on other issues of law raised at first instance that he lost on and have not yet been subject to appeal. The attempted appeal to the supreme court was specifically on the issue of the US assurances. In January last year, district judge Vanessa Baraitser blocked extradition on the basis that procedures in prisons in the US would not prevent Assange from potentially taking his own life. But that decision was overturned by two senior judges, Lord Burnett of Maldon, the lord chief justice, and Lord Justice Holroyde, at the high court. Burnett said the risk of Assange being held in highly restrictive US prison conditions was “excluded by the assurances which are offered. It follows that we are satisfied that, if the assurances had been before the judge, she would have answered the relevant question differently.” Responding to the supreme court’s decision, a spokesperson for Assange’s solicitors, Birnberg Peirce, said: “We regret that the opportunity has not been taken to consider the troubling circumstances in which requesting states can provide caveated guarantees after the conclusion of a full evidential hearing. In Mr Assange’s case, the court had found that there was a real risk of prohibited treatment in the event of his onward extradition.” Assange is due to marry his fiancee, the lawyer Stella Moris, in Belmarsh prison on 23 March.",News/Media,Julian Assange denied permission to appeal against US extradition,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/14/julian-assange-denied-permission-to-appeal-against-us-extradition
3/15/2022,"Last month, Boris Johnson argued that the downward trends in Covid cases and hospitalisations meant that it was time to scrap restrictions. Now both are rising. But the government is ending testing and most surveillance studies. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said that the rise was “to be expected” – though this foresight did not extend to having a plan to deal with the increase in infections. Instead, he dismissed the concern about the new Deltacron variant. The health secretary seemed nonchalant about the threat the virus now posed. Mr Javid may be right that the country has weathered the worst of the pandemic, but Covid is not yet in retreat. The Treasury’s penny-pinching means that the UK is abandoning essential defences. It makes no sense to withdraw funding from a series of studies that allow the spread of the virus to be mapped in detail. Without the data, experts won’t be able to effectively monitor the disease. The country will be less effective in responding and adjusting to future waves of infection. Individuals will be less able to make informed choices about the risks involved. The clinically vulnerable face being cut off from everyday life. “It is like turning off the headlights at the first sign of dawn,” Stephen Reicher, a psychologist at the University of St Andrews, told the Guardian. “You can’t see what’s coming and you don’t know when it makes sense to turn them on again.” With the end of mass free public testing, and Sage scientists no longer providing regular advice, ministers are adopting a “See no Covid, hear no Covid, speak no Covid” strategy. Mr Javid is betting on a fourth booster rollout and antivirals to keep at bay any resurgent threats. Vaccinations are the main reason for a lower mortality rate. Doctors say that there is a misguided belief that Covid is becoming similar in its impact to influenza. Flu is viewed as “only” a lethal danger to the elderly. It may be unpleasant, but rarely can cause death in a healthy person. Covid-19, by contrast, was in January the third leading cause of death in England and Wales. At the February press conference where Mr Johnson announced the end of legal restrictions, England’s chief medical officer, Sir Chris Whitty, urged people to continue following the advice to use masks in crowded spaces, to ensure good ventilation and to avoid others if they were infected with Covid. This was good public health advice. Yet that message has been conspicuous by its absence. A prime minister battling to save his own political career was reluctant to make the case before Tory MPs who chafed against even light measures. Given current infection rates, people who test positive ought to be advised to stay at home. Yet in two weeks this guidance will be dropped – and Covid rates are likely to rise further. Most people are exhausted – physically and emotionally – after two years of sacrifices. Few want to see the return of legal restrictions and lockdowns to squash an unexpected viral outbreak. Economic and personal freedoms would be best supported by monitoring Covid’s spread and giving people the right information on how to protect themselves and others. Coronavirus no longer disrupts life as much as it used to. But that is largely because vaccines have remained effective against the dominant strain. The government’s strategy of hoping that this remains the case seems braver now than when it was announced last month.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on eising rates of Covid: there’s no plan beyond vaccines | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/14/the-guardian-view-on-rising-rates-of-covid-theres-no-plan-beyond-vaccines
3/15/2022,"The enormously profitable gambling industry has been on notice for some time. Amid mounting evidence of the severe problems that its products can cause, with hundreds of gambling-linked suicides every year, the government launched a review of current laws in 2020. A white paper tabling its proposals for change is expected soon. Industry lobbyists have spent the intervening period doing all that they can to soften the expected blows to their business model, while campaigners, including bereaved families, have argued for a regulatory framework that takes human frailty into account. Evidence suggests it is the latter who have the public’s support, with one survey showing that three-quarters of adults favour restrictions on gambling adverts. A report from the Social Market Foundation co-authored by Prof Henrietta Bowden-Jones, the director of the National Problem Gambling Clinic, should stiffen reformers’ resolve. It makes the case for a new board funded by a statutory industry levy, to oversee national efforts to reduce gambling-related harm. Currently, voluntary contributions from gambling businesses – which between them are responsible for around £11bn of annual losses by gamblers – are funnelled through a charity, GambleAware. But this activity is poorly integrated with other NHS services, and suffers from a lack of research and evaluation. Last month, the NHS severed links with GambleAware, citing concerns about the charity’s independence, while affirming its commitment to NHS addiction services. Demand for these rose sharply last year, with a 16.2% increase (from 575 to 668 referrals) in the number of people seeking help in England for severe gambling issues. Company contributions should be in proportion to the harm that their activities cause, and there is work to be done on how exactly the levy would work. But the argument that it should be compulsory, not voluntary, is correct. In fact, this should have happened years ago. The remit of addiction work must also be broadened to encompass prevention. It is not enough to offer support to those individuals who are most severely harmed. The government estimates that while the vast majority of England’s 24.5 million gamblers do not have a problem (many restrict their gambling to the national lottery), 0.5% of them do. A testing regime for new products, and a cap on the amount that can be staked online, would restrict businesses’ ability to manipulate their customers into taking unhealthy risks. There is plentiful evidence, including in a new book by the Guardian’s Rob Davies, that companies have grown more sophisticated in their efforts to maximise profits by exploiting cognitive biases and disguising losses as wins. Between 2020 and 2021, the firms handed over £225,000 in “wages and freebies” to MPs. Since 2020, a former Labour MP Michael Dugher has been a prominent industry lobbyist. Denise Coates, the billionaire owner of Bet365, pays more UK taxes than anyone else. Inevitably, such wealth brings power. By contrast, there can be few people more desperately powerless than the people – often young men – who have gambled too much and found themselves in debt, obsessed and afraid. It is the government’s duty to protect both these adults and children, who Prof Bowden-Jones says have been placed at risk by “too much exposure to gambling” since the advent of ubiquitous online and sports advertising and smartphone access to 24/7 betting apps. MPs must call time on the claim that gambling is harmless fun.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the gambling industry: an intervention is overdue | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/14/the-guardian-view-on-the-gambling-industry-an-intervention-is-overdue
3/15/2022,"The French music group Believe, which has worked with artists including Björk, La Roux and Slayer, has pledged to keep its operations open in Russia and is advising partners how to work around sanctions imposed over the invasion of Ukraine. The company, one of France’s biggest tech businesses valued at €1.1bn (£920m) on the Paris stock exchange, sent a newsletter on Friday to its partners in Russia, including record labels and artists, updating them on its operations in the region. The update, which the Guardian has reviewed in both the original Russian and an English translation, assures its partners that it continues to operate and will continue to make scheduled payments, except to those whose accounts are with banks that have imposed sanctions. The letter then goes on to offer solutions to legally circumvent the banking ban by advising opening a new account with a restriction-free bank and then linking it to Believe. The translation says the company will continue to “promptly adapt our solutions in accordance with ongoing changes”. The position adopted by Believe, which serves artists and independent music labels around the world to build popularity via social media and put their work on streaming platforms such as Apple Music, is in stark contrast to leading players in the music industry. The world’s biggest record companies – Universal Music, Sony Music and Warner Music – have suspended or closed their operations in Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine, as have the streaming services Spotify, YouTube, Deezer and TikTok. Believe has almost 1,500 staff working in 50 countries and claims to provide artists and repertoire (A&R) and management services to 850,000 acts worldwide. Its UK operation lists La Roux, the singer of hits including Bulletproof whose real name is Elly Jackson, Girli, Fumez the Engineer and The Plug as acts on its books. Believe was founded in 2005 and floated on Euronext last year, making it the first flotation of a tech company in Paris since 2014. Late last year, Believe made management appointments to strengthen its business in Russia and eastern Europe, where it is estimated to make about 10% of global revenues. “Russia and eastern Europe have long been high priorities for Believe as the company was the first international music company to establish a presence in the region in 2013,” the company said late last year. As of November, Believe said it had a team of 50 in Russia and was also active in 15 eastern European territories, with a team of 25, and had more than 1,000 clients in the region. “They are a public company and they are watching every other business – including the music industry – suspend or shut operations because of what is happening in Ukraine,” said one music industry executive. “Believe has gone in the opposite direction and is not just promoting that they are still in the marketplace but are also actively working to show partners how to get around sanctions.” The company owns brands including New York-based music distribution platform TuneCore and in 2018 bought a controlling stake in Germany’s Nuclear Blast, one of the biggest labels in rock and metal music that is home to acts including Slayer, Sepultura and Machinehead. Other music labels listed on Believe’s brands page include: Allpoints France, which has worked with Björk; AFM records, which has Anvil and Lordi on its roster; and Naive, home to French acts M83 and Youssou N’Dour. Earlier this month, Björk tweeted to her almost 800,000 followers that she was cancelling a show in Moscow after the invasion. Companies and artists who work with Believe outside Russia were not party to the memo and are not connected with its stance on continuing operations and payments in the country. David Bianchi, global chief executive of Various Artists Management, which represents La Roux and other artists that have worked with Believe, said: “We were unaware of this situation and are holding urgent talks with Believe to ascertain all the facts in this matter. “Various Artists and the artists we represent stand in full solidarity with Ukraine. We will not be undertaking any commercial or cultural activities that involve Russia or with companies and individuals who are connected to Russia moving forward.” Bianchi said that he had asked Believe UK to remove all marketing and promotional imagery relating to La Roux from its website. On Monday, Believe moved to clarify its position, saying that it has stopped hiring and new investment in Russia and has suspended activities including releasing music from independent artists that use its services, as well as terminating relationships with local labels and artists it works with directly. “No different from other international music companies, Believe is continuing to fulfil its agreed-upon obligations to our people, our artists and labels, including its payment obligations to Russian labels in full compliance with international sanctions,” a spokesperson said. “Our priority has been and remains to ensure the safety of our team members, artists and labels and that of families in the region, fully comply with international sanctions and support humanitarian efforts for Ukrainian refugees.” Believe said it has made a donation to the UN refugee agency, ensured that its Ukrainian staff, their families and artists and the labels it works with are “safe and supported”, and raised awareness and financial support for the country “through the promotion of playlists of Ukrainian artists internationally”.

In a statement, Campion said: “I made a thoughtless comment equating what I do in the film world with all that Serena Williams and Venus Williams have achieved. I did not intend to devalue these two legendary Black women and world-class athletes.” Winning best director at the CCA on Sunday, Campion acknowledged women at the ceremony including the actor Halle Berry and the Williams sisters, whose youth and relationship with their father is the subject of the film King Richard. “Venus and Serena, what an honor to be in the room with you,” Campion said, before jokingly requesting tennis lessons. Campion went on to thank her fellow best director nominees, all male, then said: “I’d also just like to give my love out to my fellow – the guys. And Serena and Venus, you are such marvels. However, you do not play against the guys like I have to.” Cameras showed Serena Williams applauding but Venus Williams seeming uncomfortable. In careers which include 122 singles titles and three Olympic gold medals between them, the Williams sisters have competed against men, winning several mixed doubles titles. Campion’s remark quickly trended on social media, with many calling the comments “racist”, “backhanded” or lacking in awareness. Drew Dixon, a producer, said: “The nerve of Jane Campion to suggest her journey is harder than that of two Black women who’ve overcome racism, sexism and classism in one of the whitest, richest sports in the world to become CHAMPIONS again and again is why I have trust issues with white feminists.” The actor Jodie Turner-Smith, who attended the CCA ceremony, tweeted: “[Jane] taking time out of her best director speech to tell two Black women that she is more oppressed than them is PEAK white feminism.” Campion has come under fire before. At the Venice festival last September, she said the #MeToo movement, against sexual harassment and violence, represented “the end of apartheid for us women”. Many suggested that remark ignored Black women affected by apartheid in South Africa, as well as the many barriers faced by marginalized women in the entertainment industry. In her apology on Monday, Campion said: “The fact is the Williams sisters have, actually, squared off against men on the court (and off), and they have both raised the bar and opened doors for what is possible for women in this world. “The last thing I would ever want to do is minimize remarkable women. I love Serena and Venus. Their accomplishments are titanic and inspiring.

3/15/2022,"Ivan and Ekaterina Koslov are used to being away from home on tour with the Kyiv City Ballet company. What they are not used to is being stranded in a foreign country unable to return. The couple arrived in Paris on 23 February, with 38 young dancers for a short tour of a children’s version of The Nutcracker. Just hours later Russia invaded Ukraine and all flights to and from Kyiv Airport were immediately halted. “We woke up on the morning of the invasion to dozens and dozens of messages on our phones saying Ukraine was being invaded,” said Ekaterina, 30. Sitting in a Paris cafe she raised her hand higher and higher, asking: “What’s the word for something that is much, much bigger than a shock?” “A bad surprise?” said husband Ivan, 39, who founded the Ukrainian capital’s ballet corps, which he now directs, in 2012. He shook his head. “We never, thought anything like this will happen. For many of the dancers I don’t think it has sunk in. They are in shock, they are worried about their families. We are seeing things on the television but still it doesn’t seem real.” If everything had gone according to plan, the ballet troupe would have been back in Kyiv on Monday, rehearsing for new performances of Cinderella and Romeo and Juliet under the direction of Koslov, an internationally known dancer who has performed at the Bolshoi. Now they have no idea when they might see their homes and families again. They are also worried about the other 30 dancers in the company who are currently in the Ukrainian capital, which is under attack by Russian forces. “Please don’t say we are ‘stuck’ in Paris, because these words should not be put together and besides we are so much more fortunate than the others,” said Koslova, who is deputy director of the ballet. “Everyone in France has been wonderful. We are being well taken care of so we are the lucky ones.” The dancers are currently being put up at a hotel and had been “overwhelmed” by offers of accommodation, pointe shoes and leotards, she said. Paris City Hall has given the company a residency at the Théatre du Châtelet on the right bank of the Seine, to rehearse – and perform when possible – but the theatre has its own full programme. Last week, after news that the Kyiv City Ballet was unexpectedly in exile, the company performed and led a dance class alongside colleagues from the Paris Opera at the Châtelet to raise money for the Red Cross. They received a standing ovation after singing the Ukrainian anthem while the national blue and yellow flag was projected on to the stage. “We’re really grateful to the Châtelet theatre but we don’t want to be a nuisance because it has its own events to put on,” Koslova said. “Because it was a short tour we thought we would take some of the younger dancers so they could gain some experience. Also our principal dancers were due to come out the day the airport was closed so we have had to perform without them. We’d like to keep performing but at the moment we can only do the Nutcracker because that is all we have costumes for. “We don’t want to complain and we don’t want to ask for anything. There is a war on, people are dying so it seems crazy to be asking about whether we can get other costumes sent over when we are already in a better position than the others. But dancers are like violins, they need to rehearse and perform to be kept in tune. “Our families are happy because we are safe. Part of me wants to go back and help my country but at the same time I feel I can perhaps be more use staying here.” The Kyiv company had final performances in the western French cities of Nantes and Tours last weekend and the Châtelet has organised for them to take the Nutcracker to Toulouse and Vannes later this month. The couple said the company just wanted to perform. “It’s not easy for us to organise but we would be more than honoured to dance anywhere in the world,” Koslova said. “Except Russia, of course.”",News/World news,‘We are the lucky ones’: Kyiv City Ballet troupe stranded in Paris,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/we-are-the-lucky-ones-kyiv-city-ballet-troupe-stranded-in-paris
3/15/2022,"It might have been removed from the basket of goods used to calculate the UK’s annual inflation rate but that does not mean the suit is dead. If it really were the death knell for the staple of men’s business attire then surely the Office for National Statistics would have replaced it with some tracksuit bottoms or even some shorts? Instead, what’s taken its place is “a formal jacket or blazer”. It is an admission that these two very strange years of pandemic living have altered our daily sartorial habits but not transformed them completely. As offices vacated and many of us adapted to working from home, a clear shift to “top-down dressing” emerged (remember the “Zoom shirt”?). But when the government dispensed with Covid restrictions, a return to the workplace forced us to dust off our commuting wear and re-evaluate our wardrobes in a fresh light. The transition from elasticated waistbands and Uggs to formal trousers and brogues has been a tricky one, however, and most of us are navigating our new style somewhere in between. A year ago, Marks & Spencer produced a range of “semi suits” featuring the kind of stretchy fabric one might associate with sports attire. At the time, the head of menswear design told me: “Customers are looking for hybrid pieces that are smart enough to wear into the office but still offer the comfort and relaxed style that they have been accustomed to.” I think, one year on, this remains the case. Office workers still long for the comfort of their work-from-home wardrobe but equally desire options that give off an air of professionalism. It’s a “casualisation” of our wardrobe that’s not casual at all. Indeed, the current definitions of “hybrid dressing” and “casualisation” have nothing to do with the “smart casual” of the past (with all its associations of provincial restrictiveness and slovenliness). Instead, it is about simply dialling down the strict boundaries between what’s considered formal wear and what’s not. More so than No Time To Die or Peaky Blinders, Sunday night’s Baftas were a good bellwether for the suit. Stars turned out in a mix of the traditional (Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hiddleston in classic cuts) and the new (Questlove in a robe and Crocs, Daniel Kaluuya wearing those turquoise furry armbands from Prada), which suggests the suit is now more “concept” than time-honoured. It’s a concept that forces its wearer to be inventive and express themselves. The suit in all its forms isn’t dead; it is, in fact, thriving. So let’s take our “formal jacket or blazer” and get creative.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Reports of demise of men’s suit greatly exaggerated,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/14/reports-of-demise-of-mens-suit-greatly-exaggerated
3/15/2022,"Russian soldiers patrol the streets of Berdyansk in cars and armoured vehicles marked with the “Z” symbol that denotes the Russian occupying force. Local government officials in this city in southern Ukraine, which has been controlled by Russian troops for the past two weeks, have been kicked out of their offices, and the local radio station plays Soviet ballads and Russian pop songs, interspersed with excerpts from Vladimir Putin’s speeches and news items about Ukraine being “liberated from Nazis”. “We feel like we’re living a nightmare, and we don’t know when this awful dream will end,” said one local councillor in the city, who asked to remain anonymous, citing security fears. “We still can’t believe that this could have happened.” As international focus remains on Kharkiv, Mariupol and other Ukrainian cities that have come under heavy Russian bombardment, there is a less violent but no less important battle for Ukraine’s future going on in a stretch of southern Ukraine that came under Russian control in the first days of the war, without major fighting. Between Mariupol and Mykolaiv, both of which have come under Russian air attack, there are a number of sizable Ukrainian towns currently under Russian occupation. In Berdyansk, a port city to the west of Mariupol with a population of a little over 100,000, the majority of city councillors have remained loyal to Ukraine. They continue work to run the city, in defiance of the Russian occupation. However, the Russians may be about to transition to more violent methods. In nearby Melitopol, the similarly defiant mayor was reportedly kidnapped by Russian soldiers on Friday night, marched from his office with a bag over his head, and has not been heard from since. Soon after, Galina Danilchenko, a local councillor affiliated with a traditionally pro-Russian political party, appeared with a video statement calling on locals not to resist the Russians. “Our main task right now is to adapt to the new reality, so that we can begin to live in a new way,” she said. “They’re trying to set up their own authorities in the occupied cities,” said Olena Zhuk, chair of the council for Zaporizhzhia region, which contains both Melitopol and Berdyansk. “They are trying to buy people out or find supporters in the current authorities, and the mayor of Melitopol, who refused to cooperate, was kidnapped. It’s absolutely unheard-of behaviour,” she said. A Telegram channel set up by authorities in Berdyansk to communicate with locals gives a remarkable insight into how the Russian occupation unfolded on the ground. On 26 February, two days after the Russian assault on Ukraine began, the acting mayor, Alexander Svidlo, made his first video address on the channel. Sitting at a desk, a houseplant behind him, Svidlo noted that “a column of Russian hardware is moving” in the direction of the town, and asked residents to stay calm. The next day, residents were ordered to switch geolocation off on their mobile phones and remove any suspicious markings on trees or buildings that could be artillery target markers. On the evening of 27 February, Svidlo appeared again, this time in a dark room, looking exhausted and shaken. “A few hours ago, we all became witnesses of how heavy military hardware arrived on to the territory of our city,” he said. He explained that Russian soldiers had entered the city administration building. “We were offered to continue our work but under the control of those people. I believe this to be unacceptable, and so we all left the building and are continuing to work from a distance,” he said. “I don’t know what will happen tomorrow.” Svidlo and a majority of the city councillors moved from the building to continue their work elsewhere, in defiance of the Russians. At a council meeting held on 3 March, 28 of 38 councillors were present, according to one source who attended. It seems the Russian army expected large segments of the population in places like Berdyansk and Melitopol to welcome the Russian army as liberators, as happened in 2014 in Crimea. “For years they have been lying to themselves that people in Ukraine were supposedly waiting for Russia to come,” said the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a video address released over the weekend. “They did not find collaborators who would hand over the city and the power to the invaders.” Many older residents of the region felt disenfranchised in modern Ukraine, but these views have been changing gradually over the past decade, and then rapidly during the last two weeks of the Russian attack on Ukraine. “Of course, there are some fans of the ‘Russian world’ among the population, but every day they are fewer and fewer. People can see that the ‘Russian world’ is not what Russian propaganda promises. It’s poverty, violence and destruction,” said Anna Ukrainska, a schoolteacher in Berdyansk. In Berdyansk, as in many occupied cities, protests have drawn hundreds if not thousands of unarmed Ukrainians to the streets, often furiously shouting abuse at the Russian soldiers, who appear uncertain how to react. In the town of Nova Kakhovka, Russian authorities threatened to cut off water and electricity if another protest was staged, according to one resident who attended a protest a week ago. Nevertheless, on Sunday a second protest took place in the town, as well as in numerous other cities. “People came out with their children … there were also old people with walking sticks,” said Lera, a local woman who attended a protest in Kherson, a regional capital also currently under Russian control.In a video from the protest sent by Lera, protesters can be seen walking past a column of Russian military vehicles, chanting “Russian fascist occupiers, out!” At one point the Russian soldiers start shooting into the air. A counter-protest on the same day was organised by the Russians, said Lera, using people she believed were not local, and was filmed to create images suggesting Kherson was welcoming Russian troops. Rumours have been spreading that the Russian occupying authorities are planning to stage a referendum in Kherson, similar to those held in Crimea and the Donbas in 2014 that provided a veneer of legitimacy for Russian actions. Russian soldiers have set up checkpoints throughout the city, and Lera said two friends had told her that in the past few days the soldiers had started demanding to inspect the phones of those passing through. In Berdyansk, Russians have also set up checkpoints on the outskirts of the city, preventing people from leaving. In any case, doing so would require a dangerous drive across the frontlines. Supermarket shelves in the city are empty and there is a dangerous shortage of medicines. On Sunday evening, Svidlo posted that two city workers had managed to drive a van of medicines safely into the city, which would help save lives. The mayor’s office is putting together a list of people who want to leave in the event that a humanitarian corridor can be agreed with the Russians, but so far there has been no agreement. Each evening, residents listen to the voice of the Russians on the radio, who address the locals with promises of a happy new life and threaten criminal cases against Ukrainian officials. Many, however, remain sceptical of the promises. “On the radio, they address people as ‘comrades’. They still live in the Soviet Union and they want to build it here. We have already moved ahead of them by several decades, we don’t need that,” said the local councillor.",News/World news,‘We’re living a nightmare’: life in Russian-occupied southern Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/were-living-a-nightmare-life-in-russian-occupied-southern-ukraine
3/15/2022,"A Russian airstrike hit a residential building in Kyiv as Moscow’s forces stepped up their brutal campaign to capture Ukraine’s capital and other major cities. One person was found dead in the nine-storey apartment building, officials said, with three more people hospitalised as air raid sirens sounded in the capital and other cities hours before Ukrainian and Russian negotiators were set to resume talks. The Antonov aircraft plant in Kyiv was shelled by Russian forces, the Kyiv city administration said in an update on its official Telegram account. At least two people were killed and seven injured, it said. Ukrainian authorities have denied accusations by the Russians after a Ukrainian missile allegedly exploded in the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk killing at least 20 civilians. Ukrainian military spokesman Leonid Matyukhin said the missile, that carried a shrapnel warhead, was in fact a Russian rocket. The Russian and Ukrainian claims cannot be independently verified. There are reports that Russian forces blew up explosives at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Ukraine’s parliament earlier said Russian troops planned to begin “disposal” of ammunition in front of the Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe’s largest nuclear power station. At least nine people were reportedly killed and nine more wounded in an airstrike on a television tower in Ukraine’s northern Rivne region. “There are still people under the rubble,” governor Vitaliy Koval said in an online post, Reuters reports. Ninety children have been killed and more than 100 wounded in Ukraine since Russia invaded on 24 February, the Ukrainian general prosecutor’s office said. “The highest number of victims are in the Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Chernihiv, Sumy, Kherson, Mykolayiv and Zhytomyr regions,” it said in a statement. A convoy of more than 160 cars departed from Mariupol today, local officials said, in what appeared to be the first successful attempt to evacuate civilians from the encircled Ukrainian city. After several days of failed attempts to deliver supplies to Mariupol and provide safe passage out for trapped civilians, the city council said a local ceasefire was holding and the convoy had left for the city of Zaporizhzhia. A close ally of Vladimir Putin has admitted Russia’s military operation in Ukraine has not gone as quickly as the Kremlin had wanted, Reuters reports. National Guard chief Viktor Zolotov blamed the slower-than-expected progress on what he said were far-right Ukrainian forces hiding behind civilians, an accusation repeatedly made by Russian officials. Russia has denied reports that it has asked China for military equipment, claiming it has sufficient military clout to fulfil all of its aims in Ukraine without any need for help from China. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russian troops could take “major population centres under full control” in Ukraine.",News/World news,Ukraine war: everything we know on day 19 of the Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/ukraine-war-everything-we-know-on-day-19-of-the-russian-invasion
3/15/2022,"Down on the bench, Jordi Alba leaned towards to Ronald Araújo, said something cheeky and grinned. At which point, the Uruguayan, a little slow to click at first, went from huh?! to a line of his own and both of them started laughing. They covered their mouths so you couldn’t work out what it actually was but it was more fun to guess anyway, a kind of Camp Nou caption competition. Something like: “And then he only goes and says: ‘surely love is a kind of blackmail,’” perhaps. Or: “Should have gone to Spurs.” They had just gone into the 92nd minute of Sunday’s game and Barcelona were leading Osasuna 4-0. Alba had been withdrawn, invited to enjoy the rest the night off. To his left were Gerard Piqué and Ferrán Torres, their work here done, much like Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Pedri who sat in the shadows of the second row. Alongside them, Adama Traoré, Araújo and the two De Jongs hadn’t been needed but they will be. For now, they had to sit it out and watch. Alba had turned to Araújo at exactly the moment Ousmane Dembélé had escaped up the right again. This time the Frenchman’s cross fell short, but they could laugh: the game was won and Dembélé had already created two goals for the second time in 14 days. In four league matches, he had as many assists as in the previous f45. Only two players, Karim Benzema and Óscar Trejo, have more in the league. And Dembélé has startedonly seven games. He wasn’t supposed to start any more. It was 53 days since he had been handed an ultimatum: renew your contract or leave now. Or, y’know, don’t. As negotiations fell apart – Barcelona unable to reach agreement with a player their president claimed was “better than Mbappé” – Xavi Hernández had warned that leaving someone in the stands wasn’t a good look. It was not something he was “contemplating,” he said, but he had little choice. And when the ultimatum was delivered, a decision taken by club not coach, he knew it could prove impossible to impose. Dembélé, he conceded, is the one “holding the frying pan by the handle”. Not least because they needed him to sign or go in order to register others. Dembélé said he wasn’t the kind of man who gives in to blackmail. “And surely love is a kind of blackmail,” he wrote but there wasn’t much love left, if there ever really had been. For too many of his four years in Spain he had been almost irrelevant; now his time was going to end the way it played out, watching others play, or so it goes. Barcelona left him out of the squad for the next game in the cup, which might have meant there wasn’t a next game in the cup: in his absence, Barcelona were eliminated by Athletic Club. They kept pushing him towards the door, desperately seeking a solution right to the end. You name a club, they named a club. They signed people to play in his position. They tried to make him go to Spurs. But Dembélé wasn’t moving. And so, in the end, they did. When the window closed and Dembélé was still there, the threat became worthless. “We have to be intelligent, leave egos to one side and make the most of Ousmane,” Dani Alves said. “A solution hasn’t been found; he’s part of the squad and he has a contract,” the coach insisted, convincing the club of that. “We can’t shoot ourselves in the foot.” Twenty-three days after being told to leave, Dembélé ran on away at city rivals Espanyol – which was one way of ensuring he didn’t get such a hostile reception on his return. Before Dembélé reappeared at the Camp Nou four days later, Xavi asked fans not to whistle him but they did it anyway. “They didn’t take any notice of me,” the coach said, but actually some probably had: their anger and rejection was expressed briefly and extremely loudly, a statement made, but they were here to support the team it not necessarily him, and so they moved on. So did he, acting as if nothing had happened, which is how he acts often, passivity apparently is part of him. He just went to train and played games, and did very well. “He’s been a good professional, his behaviour is irreproachable: I have no complaints,” Xavi said. “I’m pleased for him because it hasn’t been an easy situation, but I always said he could be the best in the world in his position. As a club I think we were intelligent and we have to make the most of him because he is a talent.” When he had replied to Barcelona’s “blackmail” Dembélé had said his days of ignoring the things said about him were over, declaring four years of silence “finished”, and then immediately went silent again. He scored a belter against Athletic, the ball rocketing into the net, but there was no finger in the ear or on the lip, no now what?! The assists followed and there was no vindication or redemption song, not a word. Perhaps more importantly, there were no injuries, at least not yet. ⚽ @FerranTorres20 x2⚽ @Auba⚽ @RiquiPuigCatch the highlights from @FCBarcelona's big win over Osasuna in #LaLigaSantander! 📺🍿#BarçaOsasuna pic.twitter.com/pfojix4gLD Barcelona have played four league games since Espanyol and won them all; in three, they have scored four goals, the whistles fading away. You can fool all of the people some of the time and some of the people all the time but cannot fool all of the people all of the time. As for the Camp Nou people, you can’t fool them at all, Xavi said. Which was kind of ironic – Lord knows, Barcelona boards have tried – but this time it was right. “If you perform you make people happy: they see how he works, how he gives his life for Barcelona,” the coach said last night. “He made chances, passed, gave assists. There’s no debate now.” Not that it is only Dembélé, Xavi rightly starting to list the rest when the focus fell on the Frenchman on Sunday night. The league game before his return, Barcelona also scored four after all, against Atlético. They’re unbeaten in 12, and have won six of their last seven. A league table since Xavi took over from Ronald Koeman would have them second, two points behind Madrid, having lost a solitary game. The 2022 table would have them top. The actual table has them third, closing on Sevilla. Asked if they would win the league, Xavi replied: “quite honestly, it’s very difficult. Even if we did win at the Bernabéu, Madrid would still have to drop points three or four times so we can’t be very optimistic.” Not about that, no, but when it comes to it there are reasons to be cheerful, with Osasuna manager Jagoba Arrasate saying: “they’re developing an idea and the mechanics are better. They have more punch up front than the team we faced earlier in the season.” Atlético Madrid 2-1 Cadiz; Barcelona 4-0 Osasuna; Getafe 0-0 Valencia; Granada 0-1 Elche; Levante 1-1 Espanyol; Rayo Vallecano 1-1 Sevilla; Real Betis 1-0 Athletic Bilbao; Real Sociedad 1-0 Alavés; Villarreal 1-0 Celta Vigo Monday Mallorca v Real Madrid (8pm GMT) Traoré has provided more assists in 21 minutes than 20 games at Wolves. By his fifth game he had more than in the previous 73. Ferran Torres has five goals, two coming on Sunday just as doubts emerged about his finishing. Aubameyang has six. “He’s a gift from heaven,” Xavi said. Dani Alves is six weeks from his 39th birthday and flying. Sergio Busquets and Piqué aren’t finished. Nor is Alba. When it comes to talent, Pedri is the best in the world Xavi says, a footballer who “reminds me of Andrés Iniesta”. Gavi plays with his laces undone, but he’s “a wonder”, the Barcelona coach insisting: “he amazes me.” There is more, or at least there was on Sunday night. Leading 3-0 after half an hour, Barcelona could make changes, resting players ahead of a week when they go to Turkey and the Bernabéu. Walking in: Memphis, who has 10 goals; Riqui Puig who hadn’t played a minute in La Liga in 2022 and scored his first for 14 months; Clément Lenglet, who hadn’t started this year; Óscar Mingueza, who had started just once; even Martin Braithwaite appearing in the league for the first time since August. It was all almost too perfect, too good to be true. And so it proved. Just when it looked like things might actually turn out all right, they looked so wrong again, Barcelona were not even given 12 hours to enjoy the perfect evening. On Sunday night they scored four, taking their 19th point from the last 21, but by Monday lunchtime there were more worrying numbers put before them, reality returning to the surface when La Liga revealed the estimated salary limits for every club. Barcelona’s is minus €144m, the only club in the red.On Sunday night, Jordi Cruyff was asked if after all that Dembélé could even end up staying. “Hmm,” he said. “I think what matters is that when he plays he gives everything; we still can’t control the rest.”",Sport/Football,"Barça buoyant again thanks to Ousmane Dembélé, the man who wouldn’t move | Sid Lowe",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/14/barcelona-are-buoyant-again-thanks-to-dembele-the-man-who-wouldnt-move
3/15/2022,"On the night Boris Johnson finally threw his lot in with the Brexiters, naturally only his nearest and dearest were privy to his thoughts. His then wife, Marina Wheeler, was there, plus the leading leaver Michael Gove and his then wife, Sarah Vine. The odd one out over a supper of slow-roasted lamb at Johnson and Wheeler’s Islington home, meanwhile, was Evgeny Lebedev. The millionaire son of a former Russian KGB officer apparently hung out with the wives making “polite conversation in stage whispers” while Johnson and Gove talked by speakerphone to a fellow cabinet minister who was trying vainly to persuade them to back remain. Vine did not explain, in her subsequent newspaper column describing the evening, why Lebedev was playing gooseberry on such a momentous and sensitive night for the nation’s future. If the presence of the Evening Standard and Independent proprietor surprised her, however, she didn’t say so. For a famously shy man, Lebedev certainly gets around. Here he is with Dame Judi Dench and Sir Ian McKellen, photographed for the annual Evening Standard theatre awards (at which, the Guardian’s veteran awards-coverer Hadley Freeman points out, winners would invariably thank “darling Evgeny” and mention his “beautiful house in Tuscany”). Here he is handing the Standard editorship to George Osborne, an ousted chancellor in need of a job but not noticeably a journalist. Here he is photographed with Prince William, with Peter Mandelson, with Tony Blair, with Elton John. And here he is hosting what Johnson’s biographer, Tom Bower, called bacchanalian weekends in his castle in Italy every summer, where Johnson could apparently behave “like a naughty schoolboy”. There are no photographs of those, of course; just reports of an unkempt Johnson the morning after one of them looking (according to a fellow passenger at the airport) like he’d slept in his clothes. Johnson was foreign secretary at the time. But those were the days when Russian money was coursing through London’s veins – supporting the arts, bailing out football clubs, filling hedge funds and keeping Chelsea builders busy excavating mega-basements – and asking where it came from was deemed horribly unsophisticated. Back then, Putin and the endless photographs of him stripped to the waist were treated almost as a joke. So London became the site of a kind of giant cultural exchange, where billionaires could trade money for class, for access, for feeling at the very heart of things. The journalist Camilla Long, who was working for Tatler magazine when it co-hosted a characteristically lavish, star-studded party with Lebedev’s father, Alexander, at the Earl of Spencer’s Althorp estate, remembers his son as “the oligarch it’s OK to be friends with”. Socialising with them might have felt a little risque, but excitingly so. Besides, most other sources of cash around – fossil fuel companies anxious to greenwash their reputations by sponsoring art galleries, or Saudi princes keen to buy football clubs – were morally compromised. If cool Britannia were to keep up appearances then the money had to come from somewhere, didn’t it? What the last few weeks have exposed, however, is how closely the British establishment resembles an aristocratic family on its uppers: all fur coat and no knickers, still clinging to the stately home but with no money to fix the leaking roof, and in no position to be choosy. That apparently starts at the top, judging by the current internal investigation into allegations that major donors to Prince Charles’s charity secured meetings with the future king in return for their generosity. But any institution whose cachet dwarfs its bank balance is potentially in the same boat, a category embracing both main political parties and the media. Newspapers still confer clout, prestige and access to the heart of power but increasingly struggle to turn a profit, leaving titles such as the Standard and the Independent unable to refuse a generous offer. “What I do find extraordinary,” Sasha Swire wrote in her 2020 memoir, Diary of an MP’s Wife, after meeting Lebedev at Chequers during David Cameron’s time in office, “is how he has managed to penetrate the very core of the English political establishment by buying a newspaper.” It was through the Standard that he first got close to Johnson, then mayor of London. The two men had been friends for a decade by the time British intelligence services allegedly warned against giving Lebedev a peerage on security grounds; years of texting, lunching and partying in the Umbrian hills. Johnson reportedly brushed off warnings about his confidant, just as he habitually rejects anything that sounds killjoy-ish or obstructive of his freedom to do what he likes. When he entered Downing Street, he reportedly insisted on Lebedev getting that peerage – and after further evidence was provided, the security services are said to have “reframed” their advice, allowing it to go through. Duly elevated in November 2020, Lord Lebedev of Hampton and Siberia has not contributed to a debate or cast a vote since. Presumably he could always pick up the phone, if he ever wanted to express a view. Some will wonder why any of this matters, given Lebedev this week publicly denied being an “agent of Russia” and has stated his opposition to the invasion of Ukraine. It is hardly a crime to be a lover of the arts, pro-Brexit, or to want – as many rich men do – to seek his entree to an establishment happy to accommodate him. As his old friend Gove told Sky News, we must of course beware crude anti-Russian prejudice at a time when many ordinary Russian émigrés in Britain are appalled by Putin’s actions, and scared stiff their children are going to be bullied at school because of it. It’s just that this prime minister of all prime ministers is perhaps the last one you’d trust to take a sensibly precautionary approach to a millionaire – any millionaire – offering a lift on a private jet. According to his former aide Dominic Cummings, this is a man who sought money from private donors for the renovation of his flat, despite warnings that might be illegal, and was allegedly so blase about national security that he left highly classified papers lying around his flat. It’s highly unlikely any passing visitor ever sneaked a look, of course, but that doesn’t make it right. The trouble with men who never seem to think the rules apply to them is that all too often, they turn out to be precisely the men for whom those rules exist.

3/15/2022,"Facebook and Instagram users are not allowed to call for the death of Vladimir Putin, according to an update issued by their parent company. Meta had issued new guidance on Friday allowing content that condoned the harm of Russian soldiers, with media reporting at the time that it also permitted content urging violence against the Russian president. However, Meta’s president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, has clarified the rules on posts, stating that “calls for the death of a head of state” are banned. Clegg said in an internal post to staff on Sunday, first reported by Bloomberg, that the new moderation rule “is never to be interpreted as condoning violence against Russians in general”. He added: “We also do not permit calls to assassinate a head of state.” Reuters reported last week that calls for the death of Putin, and his Belarusian counterpart and ally Alexander Lukashenko, would be allowed on Meta platforms in a limited number of countries, unless they contained other targets or have two indicators of credibility, such as the location or method. The posts would be permitted in countries in eastern Europe and the Caucasus including Russia, Ukraine, Georgia and Poland, according to internal emails to Meta’s content moderators, Reuters said. However, Clegg added in the internal post on Sunday that the revised policy allowing threats of violence against the Russian military only applied in Ukraine, and “only in the context of speech regarding the Russian military invasion of Ukraine”. Despite the clarification, Russia took down the Instagram platform on Monday, cutting off 80 million users from the service. It banned Facebook on 4 March. Last week Russia’s general prosecutor’s office said it had moved to recognise Meta as an “extremist organisation and ban its activities on the territory of Russia”. A statement by the Russian communications regulator confirming the Instagram sanction did not refer to Meta’s other large platform, the WhatsApp messaging service. The Russian news agency RIA Novosti has reported that WhatsApp will not be banned. Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, said on Friday that the ban was “wrong” and would cut off millions of people from access to the world. On Monday, Instagram will be blocked in Russia. This decision will cut 80 million in Russia off from one another, and from the rest of the world as ~80% of people in Russia follow an Instagram account outside their country. This is wrong.

3/15/2022,"Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine, will address Congress on Wednesday in what could prove his most powerful plea yet for the west to take a tougher line against Vladimir Putin. Zelenskiy is expected to use the virtual address to urge members of the House of Representatives and Senate to intensify pressure on Joe Biden to allow the transfer of MiG-29 fighter jets from Poland. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said in a joint letter to members: “The Congress, our country and the world are in awe of the people of Ukraine, who have shown extraordinary courage, resilience and determination in the face of Russia’s unprovoked, vicious and illegal war.” They added: “The Congress remains unwavering in our commitment to supporting Ukraine as they face Putin’s cruel and diabolical aggression, and to passing legislation to cripple and isolate the Russian economy as well as deliver humanitarian, security and economic assistance to Ukraine. “We look forward to the privilege of welcoming President Zelenskiy’s address to the House and Senate and to convey our support to the people of Ukraine as they bravely defend democracy.” Zelenskiy, who will speak at 9am Washington time on Wednesday, has been seeking to drum up support with video briefings of foreign audiences. Last week he received a standing ovation from the British parliament and echoed William Shakespeare (“The question for us now is: ‘To be or not to be’”) and Winston Churchill (“We will fight in the forests, in the fields, on the shores, in the streets”). On Tuesday, the TV actor and comedian turned resistance leader, who has proved adept at communications under siege, is scheduled to address the Canadian parliament in Ottawa. He is also due to speak to Israel’s parliament at some stage. On 5 March, dressed in a military-green T-shirt and seated beside a Ukrainian flag, Zelenskiy spoke to more than 280 members of the House and Senate in a video call. He is said to have made a “desperate plea” for aircraft to fight Russian invaders. Most members of Congress back the White House’s refusal to attempt to impose a “no-fly zone” that could entail US pilots firing on Russians and trigger a wider conflict. Chris Murphy, chairman of the Senate appropriations homeland security subcommittee, told the Hill: “This is the most dangerous moment since the Cuban missile crisis. We have never been this close to direct conflict with Russia. “We made the right decision to openly support the Ukrainians but we just should understand the unprecedented moment that we’re living in today where we’re openly funding war against a nuclear power.” But there is a growing split over Poland’s offer to send Soviet-style MiG-29 fighter jets, which Ukrainian pilots are capable of flying, to Ukraine via a US airbase in Germany. The White House and Pentagon have rejected the proposal, wary that an increasingly reckless Putin could perceive it as escalatory and saying it raised “serious concerns” for the entire Nato alliance. Republicans and some Democrats say Zelenskiy’s request should be met. Mitt Romney, a Republican senator from Utah, said last week: “He has asked us for aircraft – specifically MiGs. We need to get him those MiGs. It is a bipartisan message.” Rob Portman, a Republican senator from Ohio visiting the Ukraine-Poland border, told CNN: “What we’ve heard directly from the Ukrainians is they want them badly. They want the ability to have better control over the skies in order to give them a fighting chance. I don’t understand why we’re not doing it.” The Democratic senator Amy Klobuchar, from Minnesota, was also on the visit. She said she had spoken to Biden “about 10 days ago” about the fighters, adding: “I’d like to see the planes over there.” The Democratic-controlled Congress approved $13.6bn in humanitarian and security aid to Ukraine last Thursday, as part of a $1.5tn spending bill that funds US government operations through 30 September. The US and allies have imposed broad sanctions on Russia after the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. Biden has announced a US ban on Russian oil imports, seen as politically risky amid soaring gas prices. Last Friday the president took more steps to punish Russia economically, targeting trade and shutting down development funds while announcing a ban on imports of Russian seafood, vodka and diamonds. On Saturday he authorised $200m in additional military equipment for Ukraine. About 59% of Americans believe Biden has been making the right decisions when it comes to the situation in Ukraine, including more than one in three Republicans, according to Navigator Research. However, asked whether they approve of Biden’s handling of the issue, Americans are more polarised, with 49% disapproving and 43% approving. Biden’s predecessor as president, Donald Trump, again refused to condemn Putin at a rally in South Carolina on Saturday. “It happens to be a man that is just driven, he’s driven to put it together,” Trump said, while claiming the war would never have happened if he was still in the White House. On Monday a fourth round of talks between Ukraine and Russia were held via videoconference amid deadly air strikes in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. At the weekend, Russian airstrikes killed 35 people at a military base near Yavoriv, outside Lviv – perilously close to the frontier with Poland, a Nato member. In a video address, Zelenskiy warned: “If you do not close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall on your territory, on Nato territory, on the homes of Nato citizens.” He urged Nato to impose a no-fly zone – a request he is likely to repeat to Congress on Wednesday.",News/World news,Volodymyr Zelenskiy expected to urge jet transfer in address to US Congress,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/volodymyr-zelenskiy-us-congress-address-mig-jets
3/15/2022,"Gaby Hinsliff’s conclusions on Westminster bullying are well-founded (Let the humiliation of John Bercow be a warning to bullying bosses everywhere, 10 March). Part of the explanation for this malignancy is that we tend to consider the few visible cases as exceptional rather than indicative. But while the reported behaviour of Dominic Cummings, Priti Patel or John Bercow may represent the higher-octane levels of outrageous conduct, it is hardly the case that lacerating tirades are rare in Westminster. In my brief stint as a parliamentary researcher I witnessed displays of unconstrained thuggery by some MPs towards their subordinates that certainly would not have been tolerated in any other branch of public service. It would also have appalled the public, who are used to seeing only the urbane, polished versions of these MPs on television. It was perfectly clear and wholly understood that, for some, party affiliations and personal ambition required these brutal tantrums to be endured as an occupational hazard. Such tolerance has three pernicious effects: lowering of the bar for what is permissible; encouraging a perception that abuse is the consequence merely of passion and perfectionism; and imagining that an elevated position should offer indemnity against sanction for behaviour for which the less exalted would be dismissed. Hinsliff is, of course, right to point to the heavy obligation that rests with the workplace “that makes the rules for everyone else”, but institutional cultures have long histories and deep roots, and their dismantling always has as many defenders as disruptors. That is why they endure despite good sense, public incredulity or common decency.Paul McGilchristColchester, Essex  Workplace bullying – which can be sideways between workers, upwards from workers to supervisors, or downwards from supervisors to workers – is rampant in many organisations. In the absence of clear policies against this, ideas about what is workplace bullying remain arbitrary and subjective. Employers should implement clear policies on this and raise awareness at all levels. People who are hurt are prone to hurting others and creating a negative work environment. Organisations should consider pre-employment psychological screening to identify people with personality disorders, while ensuring that the screening is not used to discriminate against vulnerable people, but to protect others from the harmful effects of unaddressed psychological issues.Mariam KhanLahore, Pakistan  Gaby Hinsliff does not mention Priti Patel’s history of bullying and harassment in three separate ministries. Protected by Boris Johnson’s instructions for MPs to “form a square around the Prittster”, Patel has somehow remained home secretary, while Bercow is ritually humiliated for seemingly the same (and, yes, inexcusable) offence.

3/15/2022,"Ollie Robinson is poised to make his England return in Wednesday’s second Test against West Indies in Barbados – on what is another pitch shorn of any grass – provided the fast bowler comes through one last training session unscathed. The 28-year-old missed last week’s drawn series opener in Antigua with a recurrence of the back spasms that dogged the back end of his Ashes tour but looked clear of the issue during Monday’s voluntary training session at the Kensington Oval. A lengthy spell bowling out in the middle will still need to be repeated by Robinson on Tuesday before a final decision is made. But with Mark Wood out of the match due to an elbow injury – and awaiting scan results that will dictate his continuation on tour – at least one change to Joe Root’s attack is on the cards. That said, this proposed comeback for Robinson and the expectation of a true batting surface leaves England wondering whether Root has enough variety at his disposal. As such, it could be that Lancashire’s Saqib Mahmood is handed a Test debut, adding slippery, slingy pace plus reverse swing if conditions allow. It would then be a choice between Chris Woakes and Craig Overton as to who makes way, with both struggling to offer any real threat last week. The Somerset man is similar to Robinson in terms of stature and release point – both men are 6ft 5in. That may mean that Woakes is offered one more chance to address his underwhelming overseas record. Mahmood looked sharp during a session that also featured the heartening sight of Jofra Archer bowling briskly. Approaching a year since his last England appearance due to recurrent elbow stress fractures, Archer has linked up with the squad to continue his rehabilitation with an eye on a summer return. While England trained out in the middle, Andrew Strauss, the team’s interim managing director, provided an update on his search for a permanent successor to Ashley Giles and the first steps of a review into the English game prompted by the winter’s 4-0 Ashes debacle. Speaking on the day the role of managing director of England men’s cricket was advertised publicly https://app.beapplied.com/apply/smqkq0c7a6, Strauss said: “We’re very conscious there’s a ticking clock, both in terms of appointing a director of cricket and then the head coach or potentially coaches [plural] on the back of that. “The ambition is certainly to have the Test coach in place by the first Test of the summer [2 June versus New Zealand at Lord’s], although recruitment means there are moving pieces, including notice periods.” Though Strauss will step aside after the first of these appointments, he remains the chair of the cricket performance committee and an advisor to the ECB board. The wider review he is leading aims to have recommendations signed off this September to allow time before the start of the 2023 season. In its early stages – with independent consultants set to be hired – the project will look at the England men’s teams, the talent pathway and the domestic landscape. Strauss insists the goal is about England becoming world No 1 in all formats, rather than a specific drive designed to reboot the Test team, and the raising of standards.Strauss said: “I think there are a lot of areas where the game of cricket full stop can improve professionalism. That doesn’t mean it’s unprofessional. It’s just that if you start comparing it to other sports, and their approach, there are some areas.” Past such endeavours have either seen recommendations ignored – such as key strands of the Schofield Report in 2007 – or struggled to overcome an 18-team first-class structure that features a range of different priorities. Strauss, however, pointed to the ultimately successful World Cup project that began in 2015 as an example of how the game can come together. He added: “My gut feeling is that there will be a lot more that unites us than divides us through this process. If the shop window [the England men’s team] is functioning well, the knock-on effects for the game as a whole are enormous. And I sense an appetite for us to be bold in our approach.”",Sport/Sport,Ollie Robinson set to return for England in second Test against West Indies,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/14/ollie-robinson-set-to-return-for-england-in-second-test-against-west-indies
3/15/2022,"Honeysuckle delivered the best performance of her career to win last year’s Champion Hurdle and there is no reason to suspect any of the also-rans 12 months ago can narrow the gap this time. Appreciate It and Teahupoo, by contrast, are fresh opponents for Honeysuckle with considerable scope for improvement. The time of Teahupoo’s recent Grade Three win at Gowran Park suggests the form is stronger than it might have looked. Honeysuckle (3.30), though, still has something to spare on form and gets the 7lb mares’ allowance too. The odds are short, but a win under Rachael Blackmore to elevate her further among the hurdling greats will be something to savour. 1.30 The “big three” in the market are unbeaten in seven starts over hurdles and closely matched on form and ratings. Dysart Dynamo’s winning time at Punchestown in January suggests the Irish form could be strongest and he gets the nod at around 5-2. 2.10 Edwardstone has been impressively consistent but he has little in hand on Timeform’s ratings and looks too short at 11-4. Haut En Couleurs (8-1) lacks his experience, which is a concern, but the market gave him a similar chance to stable companion Blue Lord before his fall at Leopardstown last time and his winning form on debut is rock-solid. The 2022 Cheltenham Festival will open on mainly good going after a warm, drying day at the track yesterday resulted in the ground drying out rapidly to good, good-to-soft in places, having been good-to-soft, soft in places on Sunday. There will be no watering on the Old Course – which stages the first two days of the meeting – as up to 9mm of rain are forecast for the track on Wednesday.  “It’s currently soft, good-to-soft in places on the New Course, which is in use for the last two days,” Jon Pullin, Cheltenham’s clerk of the course, said on Monday night. “We are dry today, with temperatures of around 13 or 14C, and it’s a similar forecast for the opening day, but then on Wednesday there is some rain around, with the lower end of forecasts around 3mm, but some forecasts indicating up to 8 or 9mm.  “It will be spread throughout the day, but if it becomes heavier it will be during the afternoon,"" Pullin added. ""We irrigated the New Course on Friday with 12mm, based on the forecast we were given and the warm temperatures that were expected. We’ll see where we are with forecasts for Wednesday and assess how much rain we actually get before making any decision on further watering of the New Course.” 2.50 Our Power ran into traffic problems at a vital stage at Kempton last time, but removed any doubts about his stamina for this three-mile trip when staying on well to finish within eight lengths of the winner. At 14-1, he is a very fair price to give Denman’s Gold Cup-winning jockey, Sam Thomas, his first Festival winner as a trainer. 4.10 Almost a private sweepstake for the Irish, who have the first six in the betting.

3/15/2022,"As New Zealand celebrated a national holiday, one of the country’s largest city libraries was closed, with staff and security given the day off. But an error with the automated door programming meant Tūranga’s doors opened to the public as usual – and the unstaffed and unsecured library was happily used by the public, who browsed and checked out books for hours before someone realised the mistake. As well as its books, the library is home to a wide variety of artworks and sculpture – but staff say nothing was stolen, and there were no serious incidents to report. News of the incident emerged in correspondence documents released by the council last week. A library staff member at Christchurch city council said 380 people came into the building that Sunday morning. “Our self-issue machines automatically started up and 147 books were issued by customers. No book-theft alarms went off, and at this stage nothing has been reported missing, nor have we spotted any damage.” The library was supposed to be closed for Waitangi Day, a national holiday. There was one disgruntled punter – a person who couldn’t find a librarian to assist with checking out their CDs. The staffer wrote: “One customer left a note saying they were taking some CDs because there were no librarians in sight: ‘I’ve decided to take the CDs to teach you a lesson in how not to operate a functioning library.’ The returns room was full of books and the first floor … was quite messy. My team leaders will continue to check for any missing books or other items of value.” “Lucky nothing was stolen,” another staff member wrote. The council realised what was happening after seeing comments on the library’s lack of staff on social media, and a security guard was sent to usher out the city’s browsers. “We’re grateful for the honesty of the people who used the library during this time,” said Bruce Rendall, the head of facilities, property and planning at Christchurch city council. He said there had been an investigation and the door system failing was “very rare”. “We consider all of the materials in Tūranga to be valuable because of the knowledge, ideas and joy they bring people,” he said. “To the best of our knowledge, nothing has been taken. The people who accessed the library during this time used the self-checkout machines to issue books and other materials.” Facilities managers said in correspondence that the contractors in charge of the security door system “take responsibility” for the error and had “put in place a peer review for holiday programming to ensure this won’t happen again”.",News/World news,"‘Nothing was stolen’: New Zealanders carry on borrowing from closed, unstaffed library",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/nothing-was-stolen-new-zealanders-carry-on-borrowing-from-closed-unstaffed-library
3/15/2022,"Richard Griffiths (Letters, 11 March) suggests that “the only way forward” from the current situation is for Ukraine’s independence to be guaranteed by a treaty to be signed “between Russia and the west”. Such a treaty already exists – the 1994 Budapest memorandum on security assurances. The memorandum guaranteed Ukrainian (and Belarusian and Kazhak) sovereignty and territorial integrity, prohibited the signatories from threatening or using military force against the three former Soviet and then independent states, and required the return of Soviet-era nuclear weapons on the three nations’ territory to be returned to Russian control. Russia has broken its obligations to Ukraine in 2014, by annexing Crimea and supporting breakaway statelets in Donbas, and by its current attack on Ukraine. It’s difficult to see how a treaty could resolve the situation when it is clear that Putin’s Russia has no intention of respecting existing treaties.Blaine StothardLondon  Prof Allan House (Letters, 8 March) is of course right to remind us that we all develop and assert ourselves within the social and political systems in which we exist. But he underestimates the sheer power of the narcissistic desperation that prevails among certain individuals who generate such vengeful rage against those who thwart them, way beyond the bounds set by those systems.

3/15/2022,"A teenager who is among three people accused of murdering a five-year-old boy had a “desire for violence” and threatened to kill the child and members of his foster family, a jury has been told. The 14-year-old boy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, also used to “poke, pinch and kick” his social worker and would swear violently at her to try to aggravate her, the court heard. Logan Mwangi was found in the River Ogmore in south Wales on 31 July last year having suffered more than 50 injuries to his face, head and body. His mother, Angharad Williamson, 30, stepfather John Cole, 40, and the 14-year-old are on trial for his murder. In statements read to Cardiff crown court on Monday, members of a former foster family of the teenager claimed he made their lives “hell” when he lived with them in the months before Logan’s death. They claimed they had told his social worker that he had threatened Logan and them but she had brushed this off, an allegation she denies. The boy’s foster mother said she became concerned about what she called the teenager’s “desire for violence”, and said he wanted to spar with every person he met. She described his behaviour at one point as being like a “monster”. He allegedly told members of the family he wanted to kill them and said that if the plot of the film The Purge, which tells the story of a fictional holiday when all crime is allowed, was real, he would carry out his threat. The foster father said he became “terrified” of the youth, who had told him he wanted to “punch his lights out” and would walk around chanting about how he wanted to kill people. According to the family, the youth also tormented their dog, pulling him up by his hind legs and keep him dangling even though he was aware the pet had an injured pelvis. On one occasion he sprayed a can of deodorant into the dog’s eyes, the jury was told. The court heard how the teenager allegedly said he wanted to kill Logan. The foster family said they raised concerns about his behaviour and threats with his social worker Debbie Williams but they claimed she dismissed what they said as “nonsense”. “She just brushed it off as if it was nothing,” the foster mother said in her statement. Williams, giving evidence on Monday, broke down in tears when she described Logan as a “delightful little boy.” She said: “He was a happy boy. Bright eyes. He was very polite.” The social worker said that not long before Logan’s body was found she saw the teenager and he told her to “fuck off”. Williams said: “He told me to fuck off lots of times, it was more banter though sometimes he would go too far”. He had once called her a “cunt” and used to “poke, pinch and kick” her but she said he had never hurt her. Asked if the foster family told her that the youth had threatened to kill them and Logan, she said: “Absolutely not.” Williamson and the youth deny committing murder and perverting the course of justice.

Elizabeth, in partnership with Emmeline Pankhurst, helped to form the Women’s Social and Political Union and was described by Emmeline as “the brains behind the suffrage movement”. The statue was funded after a four-year campaign by a small group of local women, Elizabeth’s Group, who were determined to see the suffragist restored to her rightful place in history.

3/15/2022,"A police firearms officer is being investigated for potential homicide offences after an unarmed man was shot dead. Sean Fitzgerald, who was 31, was shot dead in January 2019 as he fled from a house in Coventry during an intelligence-planned raid by West Midlands police officers. Fitzgerald died after receiving a single gunshot wound to the chest. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) had previously said the officer was not the subject of a criminal investigation relating to the death of Fitzgerald. In April of last year, the firearms officer who shot Fitzgerald was served with a gross misconduct notice, although the IOPC did not call for the officer to be criminally investigated. However, the IOPC said on Monday it had now decided to conduct a criminal investigation. In a statement, Derrick Campbell, the IOPC regional director for the Midlands, said that the IOPC had “revisited” its position following a review of evidence obtained and legal advice. Campbell said it did not mean that criminal charges would necessarily follow. “At the conclusion of our investigation, we will decide whether to refer the matter to the Crown Prosecution Service to consider whether any charge(s) should be brought,” he said. “This was a tragic incident that led to a man losing his life and our thoughts remain with all of those affected by Mr Fitzgerald’s death.” The family of Fitzgerald, who have previously called for a criminal investigation to be opened following his death, welcomed the decision,. Liam Fitzgerald, Sean’s brother, said: “From very soon after Sean’s death, it has been my belief that this should have been a criminal investigation. I now hope that the investigation is concluded quickly and that a decision to bring criminal charges will follow.” He added: “Sean was completely unarmed when he was killed, and I believe the force used was unnecessary and disproportionate.” Three murder or manslaughter charges have been brought against police involved in fatal shootings since Inquest began recording these incidents since 1990, it says. In all cases, the officers were found not guilty or the trial collapsed. Deborah Coles, the director of Inquest, said while the IOPC’s decision was welcome, the fatal shooting of Fitzgerald “raises serious questions and concerns, and requires the utmost scrutiny”. She added: “Accountability to the criminal standard for police officers or forces involved in deaths is rare, leading to concerns that police are too often above the law. It is essential that fatal use of force by police is examined with this high level of scrutiny. “We hope this criminal investigation is conducted promptly, rigorously and sensitively in order to establish the truth and hold those responsible for any wrongdoing to account.”",News/UK news,Police officer faces criminal inquiry over fatal shooting of unarmed man,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/14/police-officer-faces-criminal-inquiry-over-fatal-shooting-of-unarmed-man

3/15/2022,"Keir Starmer turned down a lengthy photo opportunity with Evgeny Lebedev shortly after he became Labour leader, the Guardian can reveal, with aides citing a desire to keep the Russian businessman at arm’s length. Starmer, the MP for Holborn and St Pancras in north London, was invited to spend the day with the proprietor of the Evening Standard and the Independent during the first months of the Covid pandemic. The invitation in June 2020 involved a planned visit to a church in Kensington, where Starmer would be greeted by Lord Lebedev and see the church’s efforts to feed homeless people. The pair were to prepare meals with volunteer chefs and hand out packed lunches together. Starmer’s team turned down the offer to be pictured alongside Lebedev, though said they were prepared to send a supportive quote. Sources said the invitation had been extended after a Zoom meeting with Standard staff where the possibility of a visit was initially raised with Starmer. Lebedev, the son of a former KGB agent, was given a peerage by Boris Johnson, who has insisted he is not a security risk. Johnson denied he intervened to secure a peerage for Lebedev after intelligence services had warned it would be a security risk, after reports in the Guardian and Sunday Times. Lebedev has condemned the invasion of Ukraine and called on Vladimir Putin to withdraw his troops. “At the moment many with Russian roots are under scrutiny, including myself,” Lebedev wrote. “I understand the reason for this as it is inevitable when events of such magnitude occur and the world order as we have known it in recent decades suddenly gets torn up.” Lebedev, who joined the House of Lords in November 2020 as a crossbencher, said he was “not a security risk to this country, which I love” and that while his father had been a KGB agent, he was “not some agent of Russia”. “Being Russian does not automatically make one an enemy of the state, and it is crucial we do not descend into Russophobia, like any other phobia, bigotry or discrimination,” Lebedev said. Though he has said he is not supportive of the Kremlin regime, Lebedev has used some of his public profile to question the British line on matters related to Russia, including tweets that raised whether the defector Alexander Litvinenko was “murdered by MI6”, quoting a Mail article. In 2014 he told Andrew Marr that Crimea had been “for many years” part of Russia and that “Russia has reached out to the west and I think now it’s time to stop cold war rhetoric on both sides”. In 2015 he wrote that the Syrian dictator, Bashar al-Assad, was better for the west’s “security and interests”, adding: “On this point I am emphatically with Putin.” Starmer, a former director of public prosecutions, wrote to Lord Bew, the chair of the House of Lords appointments commission, to ask him to reassess the peerage. “For Boris Johnson to nominate to the House of Lords someone who has promoted the worst conspiracy theories and defences of Vladimir Putin shows just how flawed the prime minister’s judgment is,” he said. “The accusations made by Lord Lebedev that the British security services had any involvement in the murder of Alexander Litvinenko is insulting. I have seen first-hand the real impact of Russian interference in Britain and the difficulties prosecutors encounter when dealing with those who act on behalf of Putin. This is a clearly a matter of national security.” Labour politicians have been courted by Lebedev in the past. Ed Miliband attended a party thrown by the mogul at Lebedev’s house in west London to mark the launch of London Live. Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have also attended his events, with Blair interviewed by Lebedev personally for a piece in the Independent. Brown’s wife, Sarah, attended a black-tie fundraiser hosted by Lebedev.

3/15/2022,"Virginia “Ginni” Thomas, wife of the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, has admitted attending a rally which preceded the January 6 attack on the US Capitol but denied helping to plan it. In an interview with the Washington Free Beacon, Thomas, a conservative activist who runs a political lobbying firm, said she briefly attended the rally near the White House on 6 January 2021 but left before Donald Trump addressed the crowd. Trump used his address to tell supporters to “fight like hell” in support of his lie that his defeat by Joe Biden was the result of electoral fraud. A bipartisan Senate report said seven deaths were connected to the assault on Congress which followed. Thomas said brief attendance at the rally was the full extent of her involvement. “I was disappointed and frustrated that there was violence that happened following a peaceful gathering of Trump supporters on the Ellipse on 6 January,” she told the Free Beacon, a conservative site. Investigations by the New York Times and the New Yorker have raised questions about Thomas’s ties to organizers of the January 6 rally. According to the Times, Thomas sits on the board of a rightwing group that circulated “action steps” after the 2020 election, in an attempt to keep Trump in power. One of the organizers of the rally told the Times Thomas was a peacekeeper between various factions. Thomas denied those allegations. “I played no role with those who were planning and leading the 6 January events,” she said. The Times told the Free Beacon it stood by its “fair and accurate” reporting. Thomas, who has been involved in conservative activism for decades, also categorically rejected any suggestion her political activities present a conflict of interest for her husband. Some judicial ethics experts have called on Clarence Thomas to recuse himself from cases involving causes with which his wife has been involved. However, Ginni Thomas’s comments on the morning of 6 January only intensified questions about her husband’s possible conflicts of interest. In a series of Facebook posts that are no longer visible, Thomas said “LOVE MAGA people!!!!” and “GOD BLESS EACH OF YOU STANDING UP or PRAYING!” She later added a note that the posts were written before the attack on the Capitol, according to Slate. Thomas has insisted her activism has no bearing on her husband’s rulings, saying they have kept their careers separate since he was confirmed in 1991. “Like so many married couples, we share many of the same ideals, principles and aspirations for America,” Thomas told the Free Beacon. “But we have our own separate careers and our own ideas and opinions too. Clarence doesn’t discuss his work with me and I don’t involve him in my work.” Justice Thomas’s critics will closely scrutinize his work related to the Capitol attack. In January, he provided an early hint about his opinion of efforts to investigate January 6. The supreme court rejected Trump’s request to stop a House select committee accessing his White House records.
