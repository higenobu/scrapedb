5/11/2022,"The UK is set for another bust-up with the EU over Brexit, testing the patience of European leaders trying to maintain a united front against Vladimir Putin. What is the UK threatening, why now and what are the consequences? The issue is the Northern Ireland protocol, signed by Boris Johnson in January 2020. It is now threatening to derail the new Stormont power-sharing government after the Democratic Unionist party refused to appoint new ministers until the checks on the Irish Sea border on goods coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain were scrapped. What has happened now? The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, issued a strongly worded and lengthy broadside against the EU late on Tuesday night criticising proposals it made last October to relax checks on goods crossing from Great Britain into Northern Ireland. She said the proposals “would worsen the current trading arrangements and lead to everyday items disappearing from shelves” and lead to “other unacceptable burdens on business”. And she warned that the UK “will not shy away from taking action to stabilise the situation in Northern Ireland if solutions cannot be found.” Full Liz Truss statement below - it's long. ""I'll not shy away from taking action to stabilise the situation in Northern Ireland if solutions cannot be found.” pic.twitter.com/YmTYqJN8EY She said Lincolnshire sausages and other chilled meats would need a veterinary certificate to enter Northern Ireland, sending a parcel to Northern Ireland would require more than 50 fields of information for customs declarations and there “would be powers to search people’s bags for food, like ham sandwiches, on departure from the ferry to Northern Ireland”. She also said pet owners would need to pay £280 for certificates and jabs for their dogs or cats “just to go on holiday in the UK”. And finally that VAT reliefs such as the recent energy saver could not be applied in Northern Ireland, “despite posing no risk to the EU single market”. Haven’t we heard all this before? Yes, most of it. Recall the row over the Great British banger? So why now? Negotiations with the EU over the protocol are about to restart – or implode if the UK goes ahead with threat to table new laws, possibly as early as Tuesday next week, to disapply some of the protocol. Anything new? Yes. Truss also protested that composite foods such “Thai green curry ready meals, New Zealand lamb and Brazilian pork” could disappear off the shelves if the protocol was applied in full. Why is that interesting? Remember the row about chlorinated chicken coming into the UK from the US? The Thai green curry example raises the same issue for the EU and goes to the heart of the protocol checks. They were agreed to ensure that third country goods – whether it was unregulated meat from South America or the US or counterfeit goods from China – could not slip into Ireland or the single market via Northern Ireland. What does the EU say? Last October the EU offered to scrap 80% of Northern Ireland food checks and 50% of customs checks in four discussion papers it called “far-reaching” and a “new model” for the protocol. It also repeatedly offered a deal to eliminate food checks if the UK agreed to maintain equivalent food standards as the EU. This was rejected in the overall trade deal as it could have raised a barrier in trade deals with the US and other countries with different food standards. But the EU offered the UK a bespoke deal for Northern Ireland that would have resulted in physical checks on food scrapped under an equivalence deal which would be reviewed in the event of a US trade deal. How did the UK react? The then-Brexit secretary, Lord Frost, claimed the “far-reaching” proposals were nothing of the sort – arguing the 50% reduction in customs checks was merely a reduction in 50% of the number of boxes vendors had to check when sending goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. He also demanded the role of the European court of justice as the arbiter in any potential disputes was changed. And he repeated a threat to take unilateral action to achieve his goals. Now what – will the UK walk away? Talks, stalled both because of the Ukraine war and the Northern Ireland assembly election will resume. But expect relations to get worse before they get better. The UK is expected to unveil legislation next week to disapply some of the protocol. What will the EU do if the UK walks away from the protocol? The EU Brexit, chief Maroš Šefčovič, issued a blunt statement on Tuesday warning the protocol was a “cornerstone” of the wider withdrawal agreement and “its renegotiation is not an option”. If the UK does go for the nuclear option and disapply the protocol completely, the EU has promised swift and decisive action. These could range from limited sanctions on emblematic British goods such as Scottish salmon and whiskey or suspension of the entire trade and cooperation deal. The UK knows the EU has no appetite for a row given the situation in Ukraine but the legal ground work for a trade war was undertaken last November whenFrost threatened to walk away.",News/Politics,Brexit: why has row over Northern Ireland protocol resurfaced?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/11/brexit-why-has-row-over-northern-ireland-protocol-resurfaced
5/11/2022,"The US supreme court’s upcoming decision to reverse Roe v Wade (an early draft of which was leaked last week) doesn’t ban abortions; it leaves the issue to the states. As a result, it will put another large brick in the growing wall separating blue and red America. The second American civil war is already occurring, but it is less of a war than a kind of benign separation analogous to unhappily married people who don’t want to go through the trauma of a formal divorce. One America is largely urban, racially and ethnically diverse, and young. The other is largely rural or exurban, white and older. The split is accelerating. Red zip codes are getting redder and blue zip codes, bluer. Of the nation’s total 3,143 counties, the number of super landslide counties – where a presidential candidate won at least 80% of the vote – jumped from 6% in 2004 to 22% in 2020. Surveys show Americans find it increasingly important to live around people who share their political values. Animosity toward those in the opposing party is higher than at any time in living memory. Forty-two per cent of registered voters believe Americans in the other party are “downright evil”. Almost 40% would be upset at the prospect of their child marrying someone from the opposite party. Even before the 2020 election, when asked if violence would be justified if the other party won the election, 18.3% of Democrats and 13.8% of Republicans responded in the affirmative. Increasingly, each America is running under different laws. Red states are making it nearly impossible to get abortions but easier than ever to buy guns. They’re also suppressing votes. (In Florida and Texas, teams of “election police” have been created to crack down on the rare crime of voter fraud, another fallout from Trump’s big lie.) They’re banning the teaching of America’s history of racism. They’re requiring transgender students to use bathrooms and join sports teams that reflect their gender at birth. They’re making it harder to protest; more difficult to qualify for unemployment benefits or other forms of public assistance; and almost impossible to form labor unions. And they’re passing “bounty” laws – enforced not by governments, which can be sued in federal court, but by rewards to private citizens for filing lawsuits – on issues ranging from classroom speech to abortions to vaccinations. Blue states are moving in the opposite direction. Several, including Colorado and Vermont, are codifying a right to abortion. Some are helping cover abortion expenses for out-of-staters. When Idaho proposed a ban on abortions that empowers relatives to sue anyone who helps terminate a pregnancy after six weeks, nearby Oregon approved $15m to help cover the abortion expenses of patients from other states. Maryland and Washington have expanded access and legal protections to out-of-state abortion patients. One package of pending California bills would expand access to California abortions and protect abortion providers from out-of-state legal action. After the governor of Texas ordered state agencies to investigate parents for child abuse if they provide certain medical treatments to their transgender children, California lawmakers proposed making the state a refuge for transgender youths and their families. Another California proposal would thwart enforcement of out-of-state court judgments removing children from the custody of parents who get them gender-affirming health services. California is also about to enforce a ban on ghost guns and assault weapons with a California version of Texas’ recent six-week ban on abortion, featuring $10,000 bounties to encourage lawsuits from private citizens against anyone who sells, distributes or manufactures those types of firearms. Blue states are also coordinating more of their policies. During the pandemic, blue states joined together on policies that red states rejected – such as purchasing agreements for personal protective equipment, strategies for reopening businesses as Covid subsided, even on travel from other states with high levels of Covid. At one point, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut required travelers from states with high positivity rates – Arkansas, Florida, North and South Carolina, Texas and Utah – to quarantine for two weeks before entering. But what will happen to the poor in red states, who are disproportionately people of color? “States rights” was always a cover for segregation and harsh discrimination. The poor – both white and people of color – are already especially burdened by anti-abortion legislation because they can’t afford travel to a blue state to get an abortion. They’re also hurt by the failure of red states to expand Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act; by red state de facto segregation in public schools; and by red state measures to suppress votes. One answer is for Democratic administrations and congresses in Washington to prioritize the needs of the red state poor and make extra efforts to protect the civil and political rights of people of color in red states. The failure of the Senate to muster enough votes to pass the Freedom to Vote Act, let alone revive the Voting Rights Act, suggests how difficult this will be. Blue states have a potential role here. They should spend additional resources on the needs of red state residents, such as Oregon is now doing for people from outside Oregon who seek abortions. They should prohibit state funds from being spent in any state that bans abortions or discriminates on the basis of race, ethnicity, or gender. California already bars anyone on a state payroll (including yours truly, who teaches at UC Berkeley) from getting reimbursed for travel to states that discriminate against LGBTQ+ people. Where will all this end? Not with two separate nations. What America is going through is analogous to Brexit – a lumbering, mutual decision to go separate ways on most things but remain connected on a few big things (such as national defense, monetary policy and civil and political rights). America will still be America. But it is fast becoming two versions of America. The open question is like the one faced by every couple that separates: how will the two find ways to be civil toward each other?

5/11/2022,"Michael Gove has been accused of minimising the cost of living crisis after he ruled out an emergency budget and admitted the government would fail to meet its target of building 300,000 homes a year. The levelling up secretary said it would be “patronising” for him to intervene to advise people who were struggling to make ends meet and blamed the current squeeze on global inflation. The Queen’s speech on Tuesday contained no major measures to help people with the soaring cost of living, but Boris Johnson had promised there would be news of extra assistance in the coming days. However, Gove told Sky News: “There won’t be an emergency budget. It is sometimes the case that the words from a prime minister or minister are over-interpreted. The prime minister is right. We will be saying more and doing more in order to help people with the cost of living challenge we face at the moment, but that doesn’t amount to an emergency budget. It is part of the work of government. “Last night, the prime minister convened a group of ministers – we have all done work on some of the things we could do to help. Those policy initiatives will be announced by individual departments in due course as they are worked up.” When asked about speculation of a split between Johnson and Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, who is resisting an emergency budget, Gove deployed different accents as he told BBC Breakfast: “It is an example of some commentators chasing their own tails and trying to take a statement that is common-sensical, turning it into a ‘major’ capital letters ‘big news story’. “When the Treasury quite rightly say ‘calm down’, people instead of recognising that they have overinflated the story in the first place then say: ‘Oh, this is clearly a split.’ “The truth is the prime minister says ‘government is working hard’ and the Treasury say: ‘Yes we are and I’m afraid the budget is going to be when we said it would be.’ That becomes a story? No.” Pressed on his own responsibility for housing, Gove could not commit to the target of building 300,000 new homes a year by the middle of the decade – a Conservative manifesto pledge designed to reduce housing costs. He said it should not be about “arithmetic” but partly about “beauty” to ensure that people were happy to have development in their areas, as he said the public would get a greater say over new housing. Gove also suggested that trying to reach a target of 300,000 could be a “Procrustean bed” – a reference to a Greek myth in which Procrustes tortures people until they fit into a bed. Christine Jardine, the Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson, said the situation was a “complete shambles”. “Millions of families and pensioners are struggling to get by. They need more help now before things get even worse in the autumn,” she said. “Instead all we get from this Conservative government is chaos and confusion. An emergency budget is needed now to cut taxes for ordinary families while taxing the super profits of oil and gas companies. That would be the fair and right thing to do.” Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor, is also calling for an emergency budget, saying the Queen’s speech “has fallen far too short on the cost of living, and on a plan to grow our economy”.",News/Business, Gove angers cost of living campaigners by ruling out emergency budget,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/11/michael-gove-angers-cost-of-living-campaigners-ruling-out-emergency-budget
5/11/2022,"The travel company Tui Group more than halved its losses over the past six months and is predicting a “strong travel summer” as customers continue to book long-awaited holidays despite cost of living pressures. Europe’s largest holiday company said future bookings remained “unabatedly high” as international travel bounced back from the coronavirus pandemic and had reached 85% of levels seen for the summer of 2019, with the pace picking up in particular over the past six weeks. UK customers are leading the way in planning their getaways, with British market bookings 11% higher than they were in summer 2019. Tui said almost 1.9 million passengers travelled with them over the past six months, almost 10 times as many as during the same period a year earlier. The travel operator said holidaymakers were also spending more money while they were away, often opting for longer breaks and choosing a higher-quality hotel or room. More customers were booking package tours, pushing Tui’s average prices higher, including a 20% increase on summer 2022 breaks. The company reported a pre-tax loss of €130m (£111.1m) between October and the end of March. This compared with a €357m loss for the same period a year earlier, when international travel was severely restricted under coronavirus mitigation measures. Tui Group’s chief executive, Fritz Joussen, said he expected the company to become profitable again in the current financial year after two years of crisis. “The strong Easter business was already the first important indicator. The high demand for travel and the good business performance now confirm our forecasts. 2022 will be a good financial year with a strong travel summer,” he said. However, the company sounded a note of caution amid the conflict in Ukraine and rising inflation, and said such uncertainties prevented it from issuing a specific financial forecast for the current financial year. A return to more normal travel operations has not been without difficulties for Tui. Earlier this month, it warned passengers that they should bring their own “plane picnics” to eat on their flights, after staff shortages prevented it from serving food and drink on some of its journeys. The company informed its airline passengers on Monday that it had “resolved” problems with its onboard catering and that they would once again be able “to purchase food and drinks onboard”. Meanwhile, some customers have taken to social media in recent days to complain about cancelled or delayed flights. Some said they had been stuck at UK airports for hours. On Monday, figures from Barclaycard showed April was the strongest month for international travel spending since before the pandemic, with Britons taking advantage of the easing of Covid restrictions to book foreign holidays. The credit provider, which processes almost half of all card transactions, said consumer spending grew 18.1% in April as airlines and travel agents had their best month since the onset of the pandemic more than two years ago.",News/Business,Tui more than halves losses as it predicts ‘strong travel summer’,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/11/tui-more-than-halves-losses-as-it-predicts-strong-travel-summer
5/11/2022,"Accused of misleading the public for decades on the promise of plastic recycling, oil and chemical companies are pushing a new idea: “advanced recycling”. Environmental advocates, however, say it’s more of the same old greenwash and litigators hope holding companies accountable for past lies might prevent the spread of a new one. In late April, California attorney general Rob Bonta launched an investigation into ExxonMobil for its role in exacerbating the global plastic pollution crisis. Bonta says he was partly inspired by a 2020 investigation from NPR and Frontline that showed how companies like ExxonMobil, Chevron, Dow and Dupont were aware of the inefficacy of plastic recycling, yet they still strategized marketing campaigns that told a different story to the public. For oil companies, those campaigns often included removing themselves from the story altogether. Even some climate advocates forget that plastic, which is made from either petroleum or ethane (a byproduct of fracking), is very much part of the climate crisis. Bonta says his investigation started with ExxonMobil because they’ve been a leader, in the plastics industry and in the messaging around recycling. A report out last year from the Mindaroo Foundation found that just 100 companies produce 90% of the world’s plastic pollution. It pinpointed ExxonMobil as the top producer in the world of single-use plastic. In a statement responding to the investigation, ExxonMobil said it is “focused on solutions” like building the first “commercial-scale advanced recycling technology” and that “meritless allegations like these distract from the important collaborative work that is under way”. But like regular old recycling, “advanced recycling” has so far shown little to no results. Also known as pyrolysis or chemical recycling, the process entails using various chemical processes to turn plastic into other materials. The most common approach is warming plastic at very high heat to turn it into a low-grade fossil fuel, which can then be used either as fuel or as a feedstock for more plastic. The technology is still in its infancy, but early studies have found that like earlier versions of plastic recycling, the “advanced” method is expensive, and that it’s difficult to collect and effectively recycle a wide variety of plastics. It also delivers few environmental benefits, not just because it’s used to create either fuel or more plastic, but also because the process itself is emissions intensive. One study commissioned by plastic manufacturers themselves found that advanced recycling generated more greenhouse gases than either landfilling plastic or burning it. The American Chemistry Council, or ACC, a trade group for the chemical industry, has been pushing advanced recycling since China shut its borders to used plastic in 2018. The group has also been lobbying state governments to exempt their recycling process from various environmental regulations – 18 states have laws on the books that either side-step certain government oversight or designate advanced recycling facilities as eligible for subsidies. It’s part of a strategy former Exxon lobbyist Keith McCoy called “getting ahead of government intervention” in a video interview with the Greenpeace-funded investigative journalism site UnEarthed in 2021. The journalists went undercover as corporate recruiters and got McCoy talking about various lobbying strategies on climate change. “The issue is going to be disposal and recycling of plastics,” McCoy said in previously unpublished portions of the interview that were shared with the Guardian. He also noted that the ACC has been working on this issue “almost exclusively, because [federal regulators] are talking about banning plastics and a lot of it has to do with plastics in the ocean and in waterways”. A new report out this week from the groups Beyond Plastics and The Last Beach Cleanup found that plastic recycling rates have actually fallen in the US since the emergence of “advanced recycling” in 2018, from its highest ever point of 9% to less than 6% today, compared with a 66% recycling rate for paper. “They’re finally kind of admitting that recycling hasn’t worked,” Beyond Plastics president Judith Enck said of groups like ACC and its members that have been lobbying against environmental protections. “And it doesn’t work by design. It’s not like they’re surprised by this. They knew all along it wouldn’t work.” And the plastic pollution crisis isn’t likely to let up. As Bonta noted in his investigation, the fossil fuel industry has spurred the expansion of plastic for years to come. “It’s their plan B as we reduce the use of fossil fuels in transportation and buildings,” he said. The International Energy Agency has said this as well, predicting that plastic production, which is forecasted to double by 2040, will be the biggest growth market for the oil industry over the next decade. McCoy noted that oil companies like his former employer ExxonMobil were uniquely suited to handle the increased scrutiny on plastics because they could use the same strategy they have deployed on climate change. “You want to get smart on it, because you know it’s coming,” he said. Environmental sociologist Dr Rebecca Altman, author of the forthcoming book An Intimate History of Plastics, points to the history of Exxon’s forefather, Standard Oil, as one of the four original companies that created the modern petrochemical industry. Mobil Oil also introduced the plastic grocery bag to American stores. “They really commercialized that and took on the paper bag, which was sort of the last bastion of paper in the US supermarket by the 1970s,” Altman said. That meant Mobil was also entrenched in the various PR battles that the chemical and energy industries were dealing with in the 1970s. “The [petrochemical] industry was really trying to figure out: how do we show our positive value? And the answer was positive advertising and then working behind the scenes on energy policy and dealing with the first wave of environmental legislation,” Altman said. “And then in the 1980s and 1990s you have this big recycling boom.” Bonta says he’d love to see advanced recycling work, but right now it’s just “words on paper”. A 2021 Reuters investigation found several examples of failed advanced recycling programs, noting that out of 30 projects operating around the world, all were either still operating on a modest scale or had shut down, and more than half were years behind schedule on previously announced commercial plans. A report from the Natural Resources Defense Council published in March noted that even when it “works” advanced recycling is not an environmentally friendly solution. Bonta says his investigation will include not only what the industry said about recycling in the past, but also the way it is marketing advanced recycling today. The inquiry may very well broaden to include other companies, or trade groups like the ACC. “We’ll go where the documents lead us,” he said. As to whether the investigation might become a lawsuit, Bonta says that is “absolutely” a possibility. “We’re not investigating just to investigate,” he said.",News/Environment,Exxon doubles down on ‘advanced recycling’ claims that yield few results,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/11/exxon-advanced-recycling-plastic-pollution-investigation
5/11/2022,"Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens and Staten, from the Battery to the top of Manhattan, New York City FC has long searched for a permanent home within the five boroughs, but has so far struggled to make it happen. Since joining Major League Soccer in 2015, NYC FC has played the majority of its home games in the Bronx-based Yankee Stadium, home to Major League Baseball’s Yankees whose owners, Yankee Global Enterprises, also have a 20% stake in the soccer club. It was supposed to be a temporary measure while NYC FC worked on finding a site for a permanent, soccer-specific home, but eight seasons later the club is still there, playing on a baseball field. And it’s still seen as a stopgap. The search continues for a site to develop a new facility, but there have been roadblocks at every turn. Many see the situation as an embarrassment for the club, and indeed, MLS. But many NYC FC fans genuinely enjoy elements of the Yankee Stadium experience, especially the supporters’ sections. The Guardian spoke to a number of NYC FC fans, online and in person, who are keen on Yankee Stadium. For many, it’s simply easier to get to than other venues where the team has played – Yankee Stadium can be reached on a number of subway lines and is near the Metro North line for fans coming into the city. And the fact that the team has now been in the area for a number of years, means many of its most loyal fans live nearby (the Bronx also has the highest proportion of Hispanic people among New York’s five boroughs, a demographic with a strong soccer following). Moving to another venue would mean a longer journey for many of the club’s fans. Citi Field, the Queens-based home of the New York Mets, has been a secondary home venue for NYC FC in recent years. Many enjoy watching games there, but those who are part of a supporters’ group tend to prefer Yankee Stadium as the bleachers make for an ideal place to congregate behind the goal. “Yankee Stadium looks a lot worse on TV than in person, in my opinion, and I love my seats there in section 135 below the supporters’ section,” says Brooklyn-based NYC FC fan Björn Bellenbaum. “I take my kids to the games, they’re teenagers now but for the first few years standing room/general admission wasn’t really an option. But we do get into it so we like to be close to the supporters’ section, so that area of seats below the bleachers is perfect and obviously wouldn’t exist in that way in a soccer stadium.” For those fans who watch on TV, the main camera angle at Yankee Stadium is often criticised for being too low and far away. But it still shows a clear view of the action, it’s just different to the slightly more top-down style common at other stadiums. There is also a tactical cam view from behind one of the goals that is unique and useful (at least for those interested in that type of thing). There have been other complaints that the area furthest away from the soccer field, behind home plate and not dissimilar to the TV angle (and incidentally where the press box is situated), is also too far away from the action. But watch a game from this vantage point in person and it’s a better view than that in some other well-known stadiums around the world, a number of which have a running track between the stands and the pitch, or even obstructed views. Then there is the issue of the small pitch dimensions, but this can also be a positive if players have the technique to shine in tight spaces, and it’s potentially ideal for narrow defensive structures and counter-pressing. NYC FC don’t lose too many games at Yankee Stadium – perhaps because away teams are unused to playing in such a constricted environment. The only away team to win there this season is Philadelphia Union, who specialise in narrow defense and high pressing. Besides, recent results suggest NYC FC players can’t hate playing at Yankee Stadium too much: they are, after all, the reigning MLS champions. Some of the criticisms from those who aren’t NYC FC fans can feel like a case of first-world problems. Yankee Stadium doesn’t fit the perception of what a soccer-watching experience usually looks like, so it’s criticised. Unorthodox doesn’t mean bad. Some of the best stadiums and the best atmospheres in world soccer will have an element of discomfort or awkwardness about them, but this is often what gives these sporting theatres a unique character. Maybe there’s also a lesson here for when the club eventually constructs its own stadium. It would be tempting to go with something like Red Bull Arena – the home of New York’s other MLS side, the New Jersey-based Red Bulls, which is an impressive if fairly generic soccer-specific stadium. Or they could keep baseball-style bleachers for standing areas, the grand scoreboards, the Americana, while also incorporating New York’s cosmopolitan character into the venue. All of this doesn’t mean NYC FC supporters should settle for the current situation. Supporting a club can often be about sticking with a team through the tough periods while simultaneously fighting for something better. But once a new home is found and a new facility built, fans could look back on the Yankee Stadium era as an “I was there” moment that wasn’t actually so bad. Some may even miss it.",Sport/Football,Is New York City FC’s stay at Yankee Stadium really an insult to soccer?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/11/new-york-city-fc-yankee-stadium-soccer-mls

5/11/2022,"Thousands of miles from the United States supreme court, protesters have been targeting women outside the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Recent weeks have seen reports of rising levels of anti-abortion protests outside Scottish hospitals, as well as ongoing anti-choice activism outside clinics across the UK. The methods are as varied as they are cruel. Calling women “Mummy!” as they walk by. Leaflets warning falsely that abortion causes cancer. Waving medically incorrect foetus dolls. Those who would force a woman through childbirth do not flinch from causing a woman distress. Since 2018 there has been an anti-abortion presence at 42 clinics across England and Wales, according to the British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS). In Scotland, 70% of reproductive-age women live in a health board area that has been targeted by anti-choice protesters in the past five years. The scale of this is vast: more than 100,000 women were subjected to anti-choice harassment while attending an appointment in 2019 (the last available data due to Covid). After a lull during the pandemic lockdowns, BPAS tells me anti-choice activity outside clinics has now escalated. Women have reported severe intimidation to the charity. Men waiting for them and being followed from their car. Boyfriends having to “shield” them to be able to get by. Having panic attacks as they walk in. Centuries ago, “fallen” women were sometimes strapped to a ducking stool at the local river. Nowadays, they are accosted at health clinics. Campaigners in the UK have long argued for buffer zones around women’s health centres to address this – in essence creating a safe space that would offer those seeking abortion legal protection from protesters. The SNP’s manifesto pledged to support local authorities to establish protest-free zones around clinics. In England, similar zones exist in a handful of areas following a landmark case in Ealing, London, thanks to years of work by feminist activists. In March, Northern Ireland (where abortion services are severely limited, despite recent legalisation) passed its own law to bring in protective buffers. And yet there is still no action from the Scottish government, nor are there plans for a buffer-zone policy across England and Wales after then home secretary Sajid Javid rejected calls for one in 2018. Without a national solution, clinics have to rely on their local councils to apply for a public spaces protection order, pushing the burden on to already cash-strapped local authorities and leaving women facing a postcode lottery of dignity. It’s hard not to feel that the inaction on buffer zones reflects that deep down, there is an acceptance of the prejudice that abortion isn’t quite “normal” healthcare. That the women going through the clinic doors may have the right to an abortion but it shouldn’t be made “easy”. No patient undertaking any other medical procedure would be expected to walk through an intimidating crowd to get treatment. If an extremist group coordinated nationwide opposition to heart transplants as being “unnatural”, ministers would soon put measures in place to protect cardiac patients. Even calling the issue protests is misleading, as if what is happening is people harmlessly exercising their democratic right. Anti-abortion activists outside clinics are not protesting – they are harassing. Their ultimate aim is not simply to protest against abortion but to obstruct women seeking what is essential, legal medical treatment. In some cases, these are calculated delaying tactics – women report missing appointments because they felt unable to face the harassment (abortion is a time-sensitive procedure). As well as patients, clinic staff are being subjected to daily intimidation at work. Some report being called “murderers” and “baby killers”, and have even been followed by activists. The growth of anti-choice intimidation in Britain will naturally be seen in the shadow of the leaked plan for the US to overturn Roe v Wade. It would be simplistic to conflate the two countries – the US and UK are different beasts politically and culturally – but it’s naive to ignore the links. Long before any law change, US anti-choice activists began by spreading disinformation through clinics, attacking doctors and getting buffer zones banned. There are coordinated efforts by wealthy American anti-choice organisations to extend their work to the UK. The US-based religious group 40 Days for Life recruited the organiser of the recent Scottish protest. Some even host Conservative MPs. The UK’s abortion law may be on firmer ground than our neighbours’ across the Atlantic, but that does not mean we should be complacent. A woman’s human rights are never permanently won. This is the time for the government to reaffirm its commitment to reproductive rights: making access to medical abortion pills at home permanent in Scotland to follow gains in England and Wales; decriminalising abortion (ending a pregnancy is still a criminal act in England and Wales unless two doctors give permission and agree it’s detrimental to the woman’s wellbeing or health); and finally introducing national buffer zone legislation. Whether it is a judge with a pen or an activist with a placard, all strategies to impinge female bodily autonomy must be resisted. The state’s refusal to offer women protection outside health clinics is not a small matter but goes to the very heart of what it means to live in a country with reproductive control. It is not enough for women to have the right to an abortion – they should have the right to one without fear, harassment or shame. Otherwise, it is barely a real right at all.

5/11/2022,"Sinthia Vee is not sure where her art supplies went. “That’s a big old question mark,” she said, sitting outside Tompkins Square Park in Manhattan’s East Village neighborhood, on a recent sunny afternoon. It will rain soon. Vee said she was sitting in solidarity with others from New York’s homeless community who – like her – had just had their encampments removed. A painter at heart whose only idea of her age is “old enough to remember a lot of things from the 80s”, Vee was now worrying about the medicine bags and art supplies she had kept in her tent that were now missing. “I lost a bunch of things that day because it was insane and we moved around a lot.” She feared the medicine bag, like many other belongings of homeless people the city is trying to remove, were thrown in a compactor. This haze – of where things went, where things go – has become a common experience for those trying to survive the string of removal of homeless encampments across the city under its new Democratic mayor, Eric Adams. Adams is building up to keeping promises he made on the campaign trail on addressing the problem of homelessness by building more shelters. In recent years, New York City has seen a surge in homelessness: in February alone, there were nearly 50,000 people in the homeless shelters, whereas the total number of homeless people in shelters was only a little over double that number in all of 2021. During his campaign, Adams said that he would pair up police with mental health service providers to address homelessness, and that there is “nothing dignified about sleeping on the streets”. But homeless advocates have slammed Adams’s tactics as simply retreading old policies that have failed to meaningfully address the underlying problems causing homelessness and are, in fact, more geared to generating sympathetic headlines in the city’s media. Johnny Grima, who has been on the streets since he was a teenager, has been on the frontlines of protests against the city’s strict moves against homeless people since Adams became mayor in January. He said while every administration has controversial measures against homelessness, it’s Adams’s “toxic” rhetoric on the issue that makes him stand out. “I think fascism works like that – as soon as there’s a tightening of the belt or any sort of shift into harder times, that fascist and oppressive elements within countries will immediately try to attack the most vulnerable,” he said. For the homeless, it’s not just a loss of their homes but also a loss of their place of belonging and safety. Grima is among those who have been brutalized in his efforts to stop being removed. The first time he was arrested, the officials came and told him and his friends they could sleep there but would have to remove their tents. “They ended up coming to the conclusion that we could sleep in the cold and wet so long as we didn’t cover ourselves, [and] that we couldn’t have a tent to protect ourselves from the elements,” he added. In late April, he would be arrested again, for the third time, for trying to hold down his tent during a raid. “They threw me on my head,” he said. He was made to wear an ankle shackle at the hospital, and was cuffed to his bed for hours before he was taken to jail, where he stayed for 12 hours. The mayor’s office said they don’t authorize any arrests, but the New York police department (NYPD) is part of the multi-agency taskforce that is participating in the sweeps. The NYPD acknowledged the arrests in a statement, claiming most people from the community have been “cooperative” and a “small number” of people were arrested. “There have been instances where individuals who have taken over public spaces to create encampments have interfered with city employees carrying out the clearing operations,” the agency said. “In those cases a small number of people have been taken into custody and issued summonses.” Peter Malvan, a homeless advocate at the Safety Net Project of the Urban Justice Center, said even though a lot of people had their belongings organized and cleaned, their belongings weren’t spared from being thrown away. “Somebody’s encampment looks like somebody’s living room,” he said. “All of that was trashed.” Mike Rodriguez, whose encampment was removed during the initial round from under the BQE bridge in Brooklyn, said he had already sorted out his and his partner’s belongings when he got the notice. Their belongings, at least what they chose to hold on to, didn’t get thrown out by the authorities. But it stings Rodriguez nonetheless, because there were things he and his partner, Parker Wolf, wanted to keep but had to throw out, including winter hats, sweaters and sneakers. They held on to their power outlets, cereal, peanut butter and jelly and some clothes. The mayor’s office said because each encampment is given prior notice, the authorities remove the belongings when they arrive there and the location hasn’t been cleared. For those whose belongings are thrown away, like Grima and Ver, the only option is to call 311 to report it. “You just have to rebuild right away, and try to keep on living,” Grima said. Two days after Grima’s arrest, the mayor’s office announced a $171m addition to the budget to add more shelters and beds. But many advocates say Adams’s focus on shelters as a solution doesn’t make a difference for the community because shelters aren’t an answer for them. As of 29 March, within 12 days of starting the crackdowns, city officials had visited 244 locations, and cleared 239 locations. Only five people accepted offers to move to a shelter. This is because most homeless people don’t consider the shelters safe and some say the staff themselves can be hostile and abusive. “The staff can say whatever they want – they call you names, belittle, threaten,” Grima said. “They do this to senior citizens and disabled people.” Malvan echoed these experiences. He said people are “passed around” from one shelter to another for “advocating for themselves”, and have been beaten by security. The mayor’s office, in response to queries about the alleged abuse, said they are “committed to prioritizing the safety of clients, staff and community members alike”. The homeless population was also particularly vulnerable during the pandemic, and putting them in shelters during this time, which the CDC recommended against, put them more at risk – as well as the public, Malvan said. At the shelters, people were made to live with about 20 others in a room, only two feet apart, he added. They were made to leave the shelters between 9am and 4pm, so they spent their days in public. “It’s like they actually created a situation where the pandemic could spread more and it affected everyone,” he said. New York City’s homeless population outside shelters were significantly less affected by the pandemic than those in shelters during the first year of the pandemic. The population in shelters had 12 times the confirmed cases of Covid compared with those outside the shelters, and 17 times more deaths. The Black homeless community had the highest number of cases both in and out of shelters. Vee, Gima, Rodriguez and Wolf came from different generations and different parts of the country but they arrived at the same crossroad of a homeless policy that has upended their vulnerable lives. They all have different aspirations. Vee hopes to someday have her own art exhibition. Gima wants to have a #Me Too moment for the shelters that will expose their conditions. “Hopefully we fight from the streets because it’s not going to come from the top,” he said. Rodriguez and Wolf spend their days scrapping metals to earn a living and buy their food, while looking for a job. As it began pouring on a cloudy April afternoon, they stood protected under the BQE bridge and surrounded by piles of discarded items – cardboard boxes, a broken stroller, shopping carts and a solitary milk carton. Rodriguez looked around, getting ready to work. He’d have to start clearing the items under the bridge. “After all,” he gestured towards one of the high-rises towering over the bridge, and shrugged, “those guys pay $3,000 per month for the view, right?”",News/US news,‘I lost a bunch of things’: homeless New Yorkers struggle amid police sweeps,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/11/new-york-city-homeless-sweeps-eric-adams
5/11/2022,"A novel subverting a Māori myth has taken home New Zealand’s most prestigious writing prize at this year’s Ockham New Zealand Book Awards. Kurangaituku by Whiti Hereaka, which draws on the Māori legend of Hatupatu and the Bird-Woman but tells it from the perspective of the tale’s traditional monster Kurangaituku, has won the $60,000 Jann Medlicott Acorn Prize for Fiction. Rob Kidd, convener of judges for the fiction category said the “epic poem of a novel” was “intense, clever and sexy as hell. It’s also an important novel. A game changer.” Hereaka beat three other short-listed novels to the prize: A Good Winter by Gigi Fenster, Greta & Valdin by Rebecca K Reilly and Entanglement by Bryan Walpert. Taking home the fiction award is “a big deal,” said Paula Morris, past winner and now spokesperson for the New Zealand Book Awards Trust which governs the Ockham awards. Hereaka is the seventh Māori writer to win the prize in its almost 50-year history. The pool of previous recipients includes Patricia Grace, the late Kerry Hulme, Alan Duff and Morris. With three more Māori writers on the longlist this year Morris is hopeful Māori award-winners will “be more frequent now”. Morris said the awards included a range of large and small publishers and “even one self published book, which was a finalist.” There was also diversity in authors and genres, she said. “You’ve got literary memoirs facing off against a book about climate change and a major work of 19th century history in just one category alone.” Vincent O’Malley’s Voices from the New Zealand War took out the top prize for nonfiction. Morris described the book as a “major work of scholarship” that brings together Māori and Pākehā [New Zealand European] voices. She said there were “loads of surprises” at Wednesday’s awards ceremony. “I don’t think they were delivering the most expected results by any means, which is a good thing.” “They were idiosyncratic and thoughtful. That is what book awards should be.” The other winners: The Booksellers Aotearoa New Zealand Award for Illustrated Non-Fiction: Dressed: Fashionable Dress in Aotearoa New Zealand 1840 to 1910 by Claire Regnault The Mary and Peter Briggs Award for Poetry: Tumble by Joanna Preston The Hubert Church Prize for a best first book of Fiction: Greta & Valdin by Rebecca K Reilly The Jessie Mackay Prize for a best first book of Poetry: Whai by Nicole Titihuia Hawkins The Judith Binney Prize for a best first work of Illustrated Non-Fiction: The Architect and the Artists: Hackshaw, McCahon, Dibble by Bridget Hackshaw The E H McCormick Prize for a best first work of General Non-Fiction: The Alarmist: Fifty Years Measuring Climate Change by Dave Lowe",News/World news,Whiti Hereaka wins New Zealand’s Ockham fiction prize for novel subverting Māori myth ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/whiti-hereaka-wins-new-zealands-ockham-fiction-prize-for-novel-subverting-maori-myth

5/11/2022,"Michael Gove has warned the EU that “no option is off the table”, including ignoring parts of the Northern Ireland protocol, after the UK argued the solution put forward by Brussels last October would worsen food shortages. Gove, a senior cabinet minister, said it would not amount to tearing up the protocol but he left open the possibility that the UK could pass legislation to disapply parts of the controversial framework. Talks between the UK and EU are at a standstill over the protocol, which aligns Northern Ireland more closely on regulations and trade with the EU than the rest of the UK – putting a border down the Irish Sea. The EU is refusing to renegotiate as it was agreed by both sides as part of the post-Brexit agreement, but the situation is causing tensions in Northern Ireland, where the Democratic Unionist party is refusing to resume power-sharing in the executive without changes. Sinn Féin pushed the DUP into second position in the assembly elections last week. Speaking on BBC Breakfast on Wednesday, Gove said: “We are going to negotiate with the EU in order to get the best possible outcome for the people of Northern Ireland, but no option is off the table. “Liz Truss will be meeting Maroš Šefčovič, the European Commission vice-president, tomorrow. They have a good relationship. They will try to make progress tomorrow. I know that both of them are fully committed to making sure we resolve some very difficult issues that have arisen. “You would expect a UK government when it is thinking about the security of the entire United Kingdom to say that there is no option that is off the table and that is absolutely right.” It comes after Truss, the foreign secretary, criticised proposals put forward by the EU last October for “failing to properly address the real issues affecting Northern Ireland and in some cases would take us backward”. She said Lincolnshire sausages and other chilled meats from Great Britain would need a veterinary certificate to enter Northern Ireland and food from outside the EU, such as Thai green curry ready meals, New Zealand lamb and Brazilian pork, would not be available in the shops. Truss said prices had risen, trade was being badly disrupted, and the people of Northern Ireland were subject to different laws and taxes than those over the Irish Sea, which she said posed a threat to peace and stability.“The answer cannot be more checks, paperwork and disruption. Our preference has always been for a negotiated solution but will not shy away from taking action to stabilise the situation in Northern Ireland if solutions cannot be found,” she said.Boris Johnson is backing Truss, making clear to the Irish taoiseach Micheál Martin on Tuesday that the situation with the protocol was “very serious”. But the EU has responded to her threats to disapply parts of the protocol by ruling out any renegotiation. Šefčovič, the European commission vice-president responsible for post-Brexit relations, said: “From the very beginning, the EU has worked tirelessly to propose creative and durable solutions, showing flexibility on how the protocol should be implemented. “The protocol, as a cornerstone of the withdrawal agreement, is an international agreement. Its renegotiation is not an option. The European Union is united in this position.”",News/Politics,"No option off the table on Northern Ireland protocol, Gove warns EU",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/11/no-option-off-the-table-on-northern-ireland-protocol-gove-warns-eu
5/11/2022,"Martin Burch had been working for the Wall Street Journal and its parent company Dow Jones for a few years and was looking for new opportunities. One Sunday in May 2021, he applied for a data analyst position at Bloomberg in London that looked like the perfect fit. He received an immediate response, asking him to take a digital assessment. It was strange. The assessment showed him different shapes and asked him to figure out the pattern. He started feeling incredulous. “Shouldn’t we be testing my abilities on the job?” he asked himself. The next day, a Monday, which happened to be a public holiday in the UK, he got a rejection email. He decided to email a recruiter at Bloomberg. Maybe the company made a mistake? What Burch discovered offers insight into a larger phenomenon that is baffling experts: while there are record level job openings in both the UK and in the US, why do many people still have to apply to sometimes hundreds of jobs, even in sought-after fields like software development, while many companies complain they can’t find the right talent? Some experts argue that algorithms and artificial intelligence now used extensively in hiring are playing a role. This is a huge shift, because until relatively recently, most hiring managers would handle applications and resumes themselves. Yet recent findings have shown that some of these new tools discriminate against women and use criteria unrelated to work to “predict” job success. While companies and vendors are not required to disclose if they use artificial intelligence or algorithms to select and hire job applicants, in my reporting I have learned that this is widespread. All the leading job platforms – including LinkedIn, ZipRecruiter, Indeed, CareerBuilder, and Monster – have told me they deploy some of these technologies. Ian Siegel, the CEO of ZipRecruiter, said that artificial intelligence and algorithms have already conquered the field. He estimates that at least three-quarters of all resumes submitted for jobs in the US are read by algorithms. “The dawn of robot recruiting has come and went and people just haven’t caught up to the realization yet,” he said. A 2021 survey of recruiting executives by the research and consulting firm Gartner found that almost all reported using AI for at least one part of the recruiting and hiring process. Yet it is not foolproof. One of the most consequential findings comes from Harvard Business School professor Joe Fuller, whose team surveyed more than 2,250 business leaders in the US, UK and Germany. Their motives for using algorithmic tools were efficiency and saving costs. Yet 88% of executives said that they know their tools reject qualified candidates. Despite the prevalence of the technology, there have just been a few famous cases of misfires. A few years back, Amazon discovered that its resume screener tool was biased against women. The algorithm was trained on resumes of current employees, who skewed male, reflecting a gender disparity in many tech fields. Over time, the tool picked up on male preferences and systematically downgraded people with the word “women” on their resumes, as in “women’s chess club” or “women’s soccer team.” Amazon’s engineers tried to fix the problem, but they couldn’t and the company discontinued the tool in 2018. “This project was only ever explored on a trial basis, and was always used with human supervision,” said Amazon spokesperson Brad Glasser. AI vendors that build these kinds of technologies say that algorithm-based tools democratize the hiring process by giving everyone a fair chance. If a company is drowning in applications, many human recruiters read only a fraction of the applications. An AI analyzes all of them and any assessments and judges every candidate the same way. Another benefit, these vendors say, is if employers choose to focus on skills and not on educational achievements like college degrees, applicants from diverse backgrounds who are often overlooked can get to the next stage of the process. “At the end of the day, we don’t want people to be hired into roles that are going to drain them and not utilize their strengths. And so it’s really not about rejecting people, it’s about ‘screening in’ the right people,” said Caitlin MacGregor, CEO of Plum, which built the assessment Burch found so puzzling. MacGregor said the company’s clients have increased their diversity and retention rates since they started to use Plum. She said the assessments helped hone in on applicants’ “potential”. But job candidates who have the necessary experience worry they’re being unfairly weeded out when companies focus on elusive factors like potential or personality traits. “This was the first time in my life, in my career, where I was sending out resumes and there was nothing,” said Javier Alvarez, 57, a distribution and sales manager from Monrovia, California, who sent out his resume more than 300 times on sites like LinkedIn and Indeed for jobs he said he was qualified for. No job offer materialized, and he started to wonder if he was being automatically excluded in some way – perhaps because of his age or salary requirements. “I felt hopeless. I started to doubt my abilities.” Ronnie Riley, a 29-year-old event planner from Canada, had a gap of several years in their resume because of an illness. Riley applied to more than 100 event planning and some administrative assistant jobs in December 2021, and over 70 jobs in January, but ended up with a total of five interviews and no job offers. They worry the gap is the reason. “It just seems it’s discounting a whole bunch of people that could be perfect for the job,” they said. Fuller’s research has helped provide answers to how exactly automatic rejections occur. One reason, he found, is that too often, job descriptions include too many criteria and skills. Many employers add new skills and criteria to existing job descriptions, building a long list of requirements. Algorithms end up rejecting many qualified applicants who may be missing just a couple of skills from the list. One executive Fuller spoke with said their company’s tool has been rejecting qualified candidates because they scored low in one important category, even when they got a near perfect score in all the other important categories. The company found that it was left with job applicants who received mediocre scores across the board. (Longer job descriptions may also deter more female applicants, Fuller believes, since many women apply to jobs only when they fulfill most of the requirements.) Another reason qualified candidates are rejected by automated systems are so-called knockout criteria. In Fuller’s research, he found that almost 50% of the executives surveyed acknowledged that their automatic systems reject job applicants outright who have a work gap longer than six months on their resumes. These applicants never get in front of a hiring manager, even if they are the most qualified candidates for the job. “The six month gap is a really insidious filter,” said Fuller, since it’s probably built on the assumption that a gap signifies something ominous, but may simply represent military deployments, pregnancy complications, caregiving obligations or illness. Experts contacted by the Guardian also described automatic resume screeners making mistakes similar to the infamous Amazon example, rooted in learning biases from an existing dataset. This hints at how these programs could end up enforcing the kinds of racial and gender biases observed with other AI tools, such as facial recognition tech and algorithms used in health care. John Scott is the chief operating officer of APMetrics, an organization that helps companies identify talent, and is often brought in by larger companies to check if new technologies the company wants to buy from a vendor are fair and legal. Scott has examined multiple resume screeners and recruiting tools and discovered problems in all of them. He found biased criteria unrelated to work, such as the name Thomas and the keyword church, to “predict” success in a job. Mark Girouard, an employment lawyer in Minneapolis, found that the name Jared and having played lacrosse in high school were used as predictors of success in one system. Martin Burch, the London jobseeker, discovered he had been weeded out in a different way. He contacted a human recruiter at Bloomberg and asked her to look at his CV. His experience lined up with the job description and this was a direct competitor, making his background all the more valuable, he thought. But the problem turned out to be the pattern-finding and personality test he had taken, which was created by Plum. A recruiter at Bloomberg replied: “I can see that your application was rejected due to not meeting our benchmark in the Plum assessment that you completed. Unfortunately on that basis we are not able to take your application any further.” Burch felt stunned that he had indeed been rejected by a piece of code. He retained a lawyer, and in communications with Bloomberg asked for a human review of his application. Bloomberg informed Burch that the role he applied for was no longer available and he wouldn’t be able to be considered for it. Bloomberg did not return emails and calls asking for comment. As adoption of AI tools in hiring expands, lawmakers are starting to take a closer look. In the UK, the government is planning new regulation of algorithmic decision making. In the US, a recent local law requires employers to inform job seekers how their application materials are screened by AI upon request. And congressional lawmakers have introduced bills that would regulate AI in hiring at a national level, including the Algorithmic Accountability Act of 2022, but have faced hurdles getting them passed. Burch decided to file an official claim with the Information Commissioner’s Office, an independent organization that upholds privacy laws in the UK. In February the office reprimanded Bloomberg, writing: “From reviewing the information provided, it is our decision that there is more work for you to do. As such, we now expect you to take steps to address any outstanding issues with the individual.” Burch has since accepted £8,000 ($9,864) in compensation from the company. He says he also fought to demonstrate a point: “I am trying to prove to them that it’s probably weeding out good candidates so they should probably stop using it.” Plum’s CEO Caitlin MacGregor declined to comment on Burch’s case directly, citing privacy concerns, but she stands behind her product: “I should not be interviewing somebody that is a 35, regardless of how much experience they have. There is somewhere else that they are going to be their own 95 [percent] match.” Instead of trying to stand out, make your resume machine-readable: no images, no special characters such as ampersands or tildes. Use the most common template. Use short, crisp sentences – declarative and quantitative, said Ian Siegel, CEO of the job platform ZipRecruiter List licenses and certifications on your resume Make sure your resume matches the keywords in the job description and compare your resume to the job description using online resume scanners to see if you are a match for the role For entry-level and administrative jobs, consider stating that you are competent in Microsoft office suite applications even if it’s not in the job description, said Harvard business professor Joe Fuller.",News/US news,Finding it hard to get a new job?

5/11/2022,"New South Wales’ premier, Dominic Perrottet, says he denied a request by the state’s anti-corruption watchdog for its funding to be made independent from government because of a “philosophical view” about the role of the executive. On Tuesday Perrottet announced an overhaul of funding for the state’s key integrity bodies, including the Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac), after long-running concerns about the role government ministers have in providing money to the agencies. Perrottet also ignored the sustained attacks on Icac from the prime minister, Scott Morrison, by announcing the agency would receive a funding boost in the June budget. Funding for Icac and other integrity agencies, including the auditor general and the NSW Electoral Commission, would “better reflect current and future resourcing needs”, Perrottet said. The changes have been welcomed by some of the state’s integrity agencies. The state’s police watchdog – the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission – told the Guardian it believed the changes would “benefit the LECC’s budget and are therefore welcome news”. The changes announced by Perrottet will make the state’s integrity agencies exempt from efficiency dividends applied to other government departments and establish a specialist unit inside Treasury, to which Icac can apply for supplementary funds. But they fall short of Icac’s request for its funding to be made independent from government. In 2020 the NSW auditor general released a report in which it warned Icac’s independence was threatened because politicians sign off on its funding. It also found some of Icac’s funding arrangements were legally “contestable”. Icac’s chief commissioner, Peter Hall QC, has repeatedly called for the watchdog’s funding to be decided by parliament. Last year he told a budget estimates hearing that the current funding arrangements were a “serious public interest issue”. On Wednesday Perrottet, who met with the heads of the integrity agencies over their funding concerns last year, said he understood the arguments put forward by Icac but disagreed because of a “philosophical view” that the executive should be in charge of funding allocations. “I believe it’s the executive, fundamentally, that makes decisions. The public service has a role to play, they come up with ideas, they provide advice to the executive, but the executive makes the decision,” he said. “That is the system we live in. So fundamentally I believe in that premise and that’s why I didn’t agree with Icac’s model.” While he said some of the integrity agencies had welcomed the changes, he accepted it did not go as far as Icac wanted but he believed “it’s much better than what we had”. “I think Icac won’t necessarily agree with the approach we’re taking, completely, but I think they will certainly see what we’ve done will address their concerns.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Geoffrey Watson, a former counsel assisting for Icac and now a director of the Centre for Public Integrity, said the government could have accepted the watchdog’s request. “The ideal arrangement would be to take all of Icac’s funding arrangements out of the hands of anything to do with government or politicians when it might be called upon them to investigated them,” he said. “It would be ideal for it to be given to an independent authority – such as the authorities that set power prices or judges’ salaries. We have bodies that do this already.” However, he said, the funding boost announced by Perrottet was “the best thing to happen to Icac in a long time”. “This is a positive step and the premier should be congratulated for doing something towards getting a proper budget back for Icac,” he said, noting previous cuts under both former premiers Mike Baird and Gladys Berejiklian.

It’s the first positive step for years.” Perrottet said some of the new measures – such as a requirement for the government to publish reasons if it does not follow Icac’s budget funding requests – would improve “openness and transparency”. “I believe it provides greater resourcing to Icac and I believe it will increase public confidence in public servants and politicians in this state and I believe it strikes the right balance.” Icac said it would “await the outcome of the government’s consideration of the commission’s budget bid as part of the forthcoming budget”.",News/Australia news,Independent funding for NSW’s Icac rejected on ‘philosophical’ grounds,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/11/independent-funding-for-nsws-icac-rejected-on-philosophical-grounds
5/11/2022,"After the bombshell leak of a supreme court draft opinion last week revealed that the majority of justices plan to overturn Roe v Wade, a handful of states have been reaffirming and expanding their abortion care. In recent days, a flurry of bills and statements have been emerging in largely Democratic-run states as lawmakers and organizations scramble to prepare for the possibility of a post-Roe America. As some states seek to become “safe havens” for out-of-state abortion seekers, other states have been increasing abortion funding, expanding provider access and offering legal protections from lawsuits launched by citizen “bounty-hunters” against those involved in abortions. Only 38% of women of reproductive age live in states that have shown support for abortion rights, according to the research organization Guttmacher Institute. In contrast, 58% live in states that have demonstrated hostility towards abortion rights. Only 4% of women live in middle-ground states. Last month, the New York state senator Liz Krueger introduced a bill that would shield New York doctors who offer abortion services to out-of-state patients by prohibiting law enforcement from cooperating with out-of-state investigations on abortion provisions. “At this critical moment New York must ensure abortion access both to New Yorkers and refugees from other states who are being denied their basic rights,” Krueger told the Guardian. “We must provide iron-clad protection for New York healthcare providers against abhorrent and regressive laws in other states,” she added. Similarly, Alessandra Biaggi, another New York state senator, introduced a bill that would create an abortion access fund and allow taxpayers to contribute to it. “We created this bill to make sure that we were not just saying that people have a right to an abortion, but also that they have access to it because we know that simply by just saying the right does not mean that people have the means to do it,” Biaggi told the Guardian. In addition to transportation costs, the fund would cover childcare services, lodging, various medical expenses and other logistical support. Biaggi also introduced another bill that would offer out-of-state women who seek abortion or gender-affirming services the claim of “unlawful interference” with their rights if they end up facing criminal or civil complaints. In Connecticut, Governor Ned Lamont signed a bill into law that will protect people who provide or receive abortion services in Connecticut and are then sued in another state. The first-in-the-nation law, which is set to take effect on 1 July, will also improve abortion access in Connecticut by expanding the type of practitioners eligible to perform certain abortion-related care. “We want to make sure that we have the healthcare infrastructure to provide for not only our own residents, but also the folks who are going to be coming here for care,” state representative Matt Blumenthal, who co-sponsored the bill, said. As Connecticut is poised to become one of the country’s few safe havens, lawmakers like Blumenthal are well aware of the challenges that will come with an uptick in out-of-state abortion seekers. “A possible influx in out-of-state patients … is definitely a concern. We’ve already seen individuals coming from Texas to get abortion care here in Connecticut and that was one of the reasons we wanted to expand the providers eligible to give the care,” he said. Blumenthal added, “We got important sources of funding in our budget this year to protect reproductive healthcare in the state and that’s very important because you know the people who are going to be affected by these bans in other states are going to be disproportionately people of low income, people of color who can’t afford to travel freely.” Another state that has been weaving additional abortion care funds into its laws is Oregon. In February, the state legislature established the Reproductive Health Equity Fund which will allocate $15m to the non-profit Seeding Justice for expanded abortion access. Seeding Justice has described the fund, which will help Oregon brace for the abortion ban in neighboring Idaho, as a “once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to invest in abortion access as a central part of Oregon’s healthcare infrastructure”. “These funds are meant to be holistic …Those funds are really focused on patients get[ting] care and extending provider capacity,” An Do, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Oregon, said. Do continued, “Within Oregon, we know that we need to be ramping up our healthcare infrastructure … and shrinking the access desert … so I think that is a big place to be able to make investments.” California has similarly positioned itself as “a refuge state” of abortion rights. In January, the state legislature introduced a package of 13 bills to designate California as a sanctuary for abortion care. In addition to offering more legal protection to out-of-state patients and providers’ privacy, the bills seek to expand the number of providers that are able to perform abortion services. One bill seeks to remove co-pays, deductibles and other cost-sharing requirements for abortions for all state-licensed health care service plans that are issued after 2022. Another bill would deny out-of-state subpoenas for patient information on reproductive health services that are granted in California. Other bills seek to protect California abortion providers by prohibiting the removal or suspension of medical licenses for a California licensee providing abortion care who is complying with state law. In Colorado, lawmakers are also rushing to codify abortion access protections. Colorado is one of the few states that does not require a 72-hour waiting period after abortion counseling. It also does not have any restrictions surrounding when in a pregnancy an abortion can take place. In April, Colorado’s governor, Jared Polis, signed the Reproductive Health Equity Act, officially encoding the right to abortion into state law. According to the Colorado health department, 13% of the 10,400 abortion seekers who had the procedure in Colorado in 2020 were from out of state. As at least three of Colorado’s immediate neighbors are certain or likely to ban abortion if Roe v Wade gets overturned, the state is preparing for an uptick in out-of-state abortion seekers, which may push Colorado residents further way to seek care. Greer Donley, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh who specializes in reproductive healthcare, told the Guardian, “People will feel the effects of Roe being overturned, even if their state continues to allow abortion provision.” “The primary way they will see these effects is through the wait times … If half the states ban all or most abortions within the next few months, then the clinics in blue states will be inundated with patients traveling from out of state,” she said. As a result, Colorado clinics have vowed to do everything they can in order to expand access to abortion providers as they struggle with worker shortages, lengthy wait times and post-abortion complications. “Capacity is critical. We know that clinics in access states are scheduling patients in weeks rather than days and they have added more exam rooms by consolidating offices and waiting areas. And opening new facilities is difficult, as is finding staff, since we are in a healthcare worker shortage,” said Elizabeth Nash, Guttmacher Institute’s state policy expert. “For patients, helping them pay for the abortion and abortion-related travel is key,” she added. In Maryland, lawmakers passed a bill last month that allows medical professionals other than physicians to perform abortions. The law will allow nurse practitioners, nurse midwives and trained physician assistants to carry out the procedure. In addition, the law will require the state to invest $3.5m annually in abortion-care training and will require the majority of insurance providers in the state to cover abortion costs. Last month, Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan filed a lawsuit in a state court that seeks to strike down the state’s 1931 law that criminalizes abortions unless they are performed to protect a woman’s life. The lawsuit also seeks to establish the right to an abortion in the state’s constitution. Despite the various steps that progressive states have taken to expand abortion access, some still have certain restrictions in place that need to be removed to ensure abortion care is fully accessible. In addition to capacity problems, another significant restriction is costs. “States need to look at how they help people pay for abortions, as we know that most patients pay out-of-pocket for their abortion,” Nash said. With at least 26 states poised to, likely or certain to ban abortions if Roe v Wade is overturned, the fight for abortion rights is more urgent than ever. “I can’t underscore how seismic a change this is,” said An Do. “We never lost a constitutional right. This is just the beginning … They [the justices] have written us all out of the constitution. What’s next is marriage equality, what’s next is so many people’s access to birth control. “We cannot be apathetic and we cannot lose ourselves into despair. We need to fight tooth and nail.”",News/World news, Pro-choice states rush to pledge legal shield for out-of-state abortions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/abortion-pro-choice-states-safe-havens-funding-legal-protection

The Labor leader Anthony Albanese has a genuine chance of becoming prime minister – but after years of brash leadership, is the country ready to take a punt on his more reasoned style? For our Australian edition, Katharine Murphy profiles the man hoping to talk Australia around. Elsewhere, the Weekly’s cover focuses on the struggle for abortion rights in the US. A leaked draft suggesting the US supreme court is about to overturn the landmark Roe v Wade ruling caused fury in much of the country. “I wanted to show the anguish I, or any other woman or teenager for that matter, would feel if the sudden overturning of a law would risk my freedom to choose wether to welcome or end a pregnancy,” says Anna Parini, an Italian illustrator based in Barcelona, of her artwork for this edition. With polls showing around two-thirds of Americans opposing such a move, critics point to the Trump-era weighting of the court with conservative judges, along with voter suppression tactics in many states, as levers in a long-planned plot to implement Republican minority rule across the US. Washington bureau chief David Smith surveys the lines for a coming battle that could tear the country apart, while Guardian US columnist Rebecca Solnit lays out a Democratic blueprint for resistance. Russia’s Victory Day parade passed without any significant new announcements from Vladimir Putin. Shaun Walker considers the significance of the day in the Russian psyche, and how Putin has warped its meaning to bolster his own rule.

5/11/2022,"There are flashes of bitter brilliance in this mobster picture from Ukrainian writer-director Oleg Sentsov, whose anti-Putin activism earned him a prison sentence from 2015 to 2019 – only ending after interventions from Amnesty International and the European parliament awarded him the Sakharov prize for human rights. This is strong, fluent, sometimes impassioned film-making, but just as its troubled gangster antihero yearns for meaning in his life beyond violence, so this film appears to be straining for the same thing. Rhino is the name of a huge, slab-faced tough guy, played by newcomer Serhii Filimonov, who grows up in late 80s Ukraine, with a mother, a brother and a sister and a drunk dad away in prison. An altercation with the wiseguys who run a local gym means Rhino has to join a rival gang for protection; they shape his natural aptitude for intimidation and violence. But he breaks away to set up his own firm and his fanatical dedication to the brutal vocation of crime, and his almost superhuman resistance to pain, bring him success – at a terrible human price. The movie begins with a bravura, seamless sequence showing Rhino’s grim upbringing, in which he is first a very little kid, then a teen, then the formidable grownup man. After this dazzling piece of choreography, though, the film establishes a more regular, heavy tread of violence, its scenes and set pieces generically familiar. There is one superb piece of ellipsis and misdirection when Rhino is hiding out in Germany and a former mob comrade Plus (Yevhen Grygoriev) comes to him with a job offer; Rhino agrees, but asks if they can first go to the forest where he has to dig something up. Rhino is narrating the film in flashback to an impassive guy with whom he now works in the debt-collecting business; I was hoping he would be a more complex, interesting or unexpected confessor figure. Even so, this is a stylish and muscular movie.  Rhino is available on 16 May on digital platforms.",Arts/Film,Rhino review – bleakness and brutality in the Ukrainian underworld,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/11/rhino-review-oleg-sentsov
5/11/2022,"Ministers are pushing people into poverty and debt through a policy that allows universal credit payments to be cut by up to 25%, a report by the Lloyds Bank Foundation has found. With the cost of living crisis already putting a severe strain on households, the report, titled Drivers of Poverty, said a system that allows deductions from benefits was leaving some people without enough money to live on, “driving impoverishment and further debt, particularly hitting the most vulnerable”. It said at a time of rising costs “the government has a choice – and a responsibility – to fix the system.” Almost half (44%) of those receiving universal credit have money automatically deducted, with an average of £78 a month withheld from their payments. For a single person aged over 25 that represents a fifth of their entitlement. A single mother quoted in the report said she was supporting three children on £118 a week and did not know why deductions were being made. “They are taking £100 a month, leaving me needing the food bank and struggling with utilities,” she said. Deductions can be made for a range of reasons, including to cover advance payments made to new claimants or to claw back overpayments. The most frequent is recovery of advances. These are given to cover expenses during the five weeks claimants must wait before universal credit begins. The advance is interest-free but must be repaid from subsequent benefits payments. Another key reason is overpayments of tax credits, but debts for energy and rent can also be clawed back through the system. The report found that historical debts around tax credit overpayments often surprised claimants who had been unaware of them. It described this as “a relic of a clunky legacy system that translates to reduced benefit levels”. The deductions taken are not means-tested, and claimants are struggling to manage on what is left as living costs rise. The report by the Lloyds Banking Group-backed foundation is based on evidence from charities. It said that, unlike when debts are recovered in the private sector, “no checks are undertaken to understand whether people can afford these deductions”. “Deductions policies and practices – not individual behaviour – are significant drivers of debt,” the report said. “The increase in the debt people face and the deductions to pay it back are the explicit result of government policy.” The foundation called for an urgent review of the system, and made recommendations for changes including converting advances into grants, reducing deductions to 5% to help people meet rising costs, and writing off historical debts stemming from government errors. It said before making any deductions from benefits, the government should follow best practice and carry out affordability assessments by qualified advisers. Paul Street, the chief executive of Lloyds Bank Foundation for England and Wales, said at a time of soaring cost of living the government was making it harder for people to make ends meet. “Charities every day see people have significant sums deducted from their benefits that they don’t understand, without warning and that doesn’t take account of their circumstances, leaving them struggling to pay their bills however well they budget,” he said. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said the cap on deductions had been reduced to 25% in April 2021 and the payback period lengthened, and that cases involving significant debt were rare. A government spokesperson said: “We carefully balance our support for claimants with our duty to protect taxpayers money so we have further reduced the cap on universal credit deductions and paused the fuel direct scheme, that allows energy bill payments to be taken directly from benefits. Safeguards are in place to ensure deductions are manageable and customers can contact DWP to discuss their repayments if they are experiencing financial hardship. “We know work is the best route out of poverty so we’re putting an average of £1,000 more per year into the pockets of working families on universal credit and have also boosted the minimum wage by more than £1,000 a year for full-time workers.”",News/Society,"Universal credit deductions of up to 25% pushing people into poverty, says report",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/11/universal-credit-deductions-pushing-people-into-poverty-says-report
