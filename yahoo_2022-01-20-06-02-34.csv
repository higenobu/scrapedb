1/20/2022,"Expect a market sell-off so significant that the Federal Reserve will likely ""not carry through"" with all of its anticipated rate hikes this year, predicts macro investor Felix Zulauf.  ""I doubt that they will be as hawkish going through the year as they are saying now,"" the CEO of Zulauf Consulting told Yahoo Finance. ""My expectation is that we have a sharp sell-off in the markets, maybe 30% from the highs, into the summer, and then the Fed and other central banks will panic,"" he added.  ""In the past, whenever the markets went down by 20%, that was about the pain level when [the Federal Reserve] began to focus on the market,"" said Zulauf.  ""I do believe that that will stop [them] from carrying through,"" added Zulauf. ""Particularly if inflation softens somewhat."" The investor expects inflation to temporarily moderate this year, as compared to the last 12 months.  The Federal Reserve is tapering its purchase of bonds in order to combat the highest rate of inflation in over 40 years. The central bank is expected to consider three short-term interest rate hikes starting as soon as March, and debate ways by which it can reduce its asset holdings. ""If they [the Fed] take liquidity out of the system, which they are intending to do by reducing their balance sheet ... I think when they begin to do that, they are probably most likely triggering a major sell-off,"" said Zulauf.  Once that happens, he predicts the Fed will ""turn around and ease again, and they become aggressive to prevent the markets from going further down, a real meltdown."" A Fed reversal will give way to a massive rally after the sell-off, says Zulauf. ""That will then trigger another wave up to new highs in 2023 and 2024.""  Roughly 40% of Nasdaq (^IXIC) stocks have quietly been getting shredded, declining at least 50% from their all time highs.  ""It doesn't show up in the Nasdaq or S&P (^GSPC) because of the — let's call them great eight: the large-cap growth stock darlings. They are still hanging up there, and I think they are building tops,"" said Zulauf. ""The darlings usually break last."" ""Once they break, then I think the game changes because they are the assets that are overweighted in virtually every portfolio,"" he said.  ""When you need to sell, because of redemptions as a mutual fund manager, you do not sell your darlings. You sell all the other stocks until you have no choice because their percentage becomes so high that you have to sell them,"" added Zulauf.  Over the last several weeks, money has flowed more into value and cyclical trades like Energy and Financial stocks. ""That will change too,"" warned Zulauf.  ""What I'm describing is really the upcoming unwinding of the inflation trade,"" which includes rising inflation, low bond yields and rising commodity prices.  ""This is all bullish for equities and real assets. And I think the markets in all the asset classes are positioned that way. It's short the bond market, and it's long the equity market. And I think that is going to change,"" said Zulauf.  On Tuesday, the Nasdaq Composite was hovering near correction territory, down almost 10% from its November high. Tech and internet stocks have been selling off recently as treasury yields have spiked. The U.S. 10-year treasury yield rose to 1.85% on Tuesday, its highest level in two years.  Ines is a markets reporter covering stocks from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

1/20/2022,"It’s not easy trying to build a passive income stream these days. Thanks to still-historically low interest rates, savings accounts pay next to nothing. And currently, the average S&P 500 company sports an annual dividend yield of just 1.3%. But that doesn’t mean you have to go home empty-handed. One man who’s made a lot of money from dividend stocks is legendary investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. In fact, the majority of Berkshire’s holdings are now dividend-paying companies. And that means each year, the Oracle of Omaha collects billions of dollars just from dividends. You don’t need to be a billionaire investor to earn dividend checks. There are plenty of apps that allow you to invest as much as you want for free. Here are three companies in Buffett’s portfolio that provide a particularly generous passive income stream to investors. Verizon was a new addition to Buffett’s portfolio in 2021. And it’s a pretty chunky stake: At the end of Q3, Berkshire owned nearly 159 million shares of the telecom giant. The company is a household name. Its 4G LTE network covers 99% of the U.S. population. And while we’re still in the early stages of 5G adoption, more than 230 million people are already covered by Verizon’s 5G network. Massive recurring revenue means Verizon is well-positioned to pay regular dividends. Right now, Verizon has a quarterly dividend rate of $0.64 per share, translating to an annual yield of 4.8%. Of course, Verizon isn’t the highest yielder in the space. AT&T, for instance, yields an even juicier 7.6%. Cell phone bills are on the rise. And what’s the old saying? If you can’t beat them, join them. If you’re not happy with what you pay Verizon or AT&T every month, collecting dividends from these companies might be a small way to get even. When it comes to delivering recession-proof returns, few companies have done a better job than healthcare giant Johnson & Johnson. The stock has been trending up for decades and for good reason. Johnson & Johnson’s business grows consistently through thick and thin. Over the past 20 years, Johnson & Johnson’s adjusted EPS has increased at a steady pace of 8% annually. And that means shareholders can look forward to higher dividends every year. Johnson & Johnson announced its 59th consecutive annual dividend increase last April. The stock currently yields 2.5% — nearly twice as much as the average yield of the S&P 500. The company boasts consumer staples found in any U.S. home: skin care products like Neutrogena, pain medications Tylenol and Motrin, Listerine, Band-Aids, and more. In fact, Johnson & Johnson recently announced plans to spin off its consumer health segment into a separate company in order to unlock value. Once the split is complete, investors will be given shares in both companies and, in turn, receive dividend payments from both stocks. That makes J&J a particularly timely and attractive inflation play. As of the most recent quarter, Berkshire owned about 327,000 shares in the company. Being a landlord is one of the oldest ways to earn a passive income. If you want to collect rental income without worrying about the headaches that come with tenants, consider using real estate investment trusts — companies that own and manage income-producing real estate. Buffett has a sizable stake in a REIT called Store Capital. Store has a large portfolio consisting of investments in over 2,700 properties diversified across 49 states. The company collects rent on these properties and passes it along to shareholders in the form of dividends. The stock is offering a handsome yield of 4.6% at the current price. Store’s tenants tend to be leading national and regional companies with large revenue bases. Notably, one of the company’s top 10 tenants is movie theater giant AMC Entertainment Holdings, whose shares are always followed these days. And because Store’s portfolio is leased to 529 tenants coming from 118 different industries, the REIT can maintain its dividend even if one tenant or industry enters a downturn. As of Berkshire's latest filing, it owned roughly 24.4 million shares in Store. 4 Ways to Earn Big Returns in 2022 Without the Shaky Stock Market Jim Rogers: Next Bear Market Will Be ‘Worst in My Lifetime’ — He'll Rely on 3 Assets Robert Kiyosaki Says We're Already in a 'Technical Depression' — He's Using These 3 Assets for Protection This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.
