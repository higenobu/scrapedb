5/3/2022,"EXCLUSIVE: Attorneys for Amber Heard are planning to ask a Virginia judge on Tuesday to dismiss Johnny Depp’s $50 million defamation case against their client. However, the defense team is almost certain to come up short, and they know it. How To Watch The Johnny Depp-Amber Heard Trial More from Deadline Amber Heard Legal Team Shifts Tactics As Actress Prepares To Testify; Johnny Depp Had $22.5M 'Pirates 6' Deal, Manager Claims How To Watch The Johnny Depp-Amber Heard Trial; Case Resumes Monday Tesla Shares Move Higher After CEO Elon Musk Says He Has Wrapped $8.5B In Stock Sales To Fund Twitter Acquisition Under the statutes of the Old Dominion, lawyers for the defense in civil cases essentially are “required,” as one legal source told us, to enter a motion to strike once the plaintiff has wrapped up their case and witnesses. Zeroing in on the specific claims of plaintiff Depp and evidence presented to support said claims, Heard’s legal team led by Elaine Bredehoft and Ben Rottenborn likely will make the motion Tuesday before Judge Penny Azcarate to agree with, reject or take under advisement, we hear. With the jury taken out of the courtroom, lawyers for both sides will have an allotted short(ish) time to make their points to Azcarte. After that, unless she makes the unlikely decision to ax the case, the judge will tell the attorneys she’s either immediately refusing the motion to strike or taking some time to think about it. She then will call the jury back in for the defense to commence its case. Pretty much assured to be unsuccessful in this high-profile matter, the motion’s primary point is to assure certain appeal rights to the defense if necessary. Reps for Heard and her lawyers had no comment on the probable move when contacted by Deadline today. Depp sued his ex-wife and Rum Diary co-star for big bucks in March 2019 after Heard penned a Washington Post op-ed about be a survivor of domestic abuse. As all sides have stated and anyone who can read can see, the 2018 piece in the Jeff Bezos-owned paper never mentioned Depp by name. Delayed by the pandemic and other issues, the case was challenged several times by Heard to little avail before the five-week trial kicked off on April 11 in the Fairfax County Courthouse. In summer 2020, the Aquaman star countersued Depp for $100 million. Later that same year, in another wrinkle in the legal fabric, Depp failed in his UK libel suit against The Sun tabloid for calling him a “wife-beater” in print. Perpetually at the periphery of the Virginia trial, that British case was in many ways a trial run – no pun totally intended – to the current American case. While the burden of proof is much higher in the US for the litigious Depp than the UK for a libel or defamation claim, the British case mainly differs from the current one in so far as Heard was not a party in the case overseas – though she did testify. “This is the same evidence given in the UK case which he resoundingly lost,” a source close to the Heard camp told Deadline of their POV on the way the Ben Chew and Camille Vasquez-led US case has played out so far. “So I supposed it’s now just a variation on that old saying ‘If at first, you don’t succeed, lie lie again,'” the source added. Despite all the explicit revelations that have come out from the end of the couple’s marriage, the 2019 lawsuit and this trial so far, this case is legally entirely about what was said in that WaPo op-ed, and what the fallout was – which in no small degree centers on the First Amendment. In Virginia, Heard is set right now to be the second witness for the defense after clinical and forensic psychologist Dr. Dawn Hughes takes the stand. Often wearing sunglasses, Depp took the stand on his own behalf for part of the second and third week of the trial. Big names like Avengers alum Paul Bettany, James Franco and would-be Twitter owner Elon Musk were on pre-trial witness lists for the respective parties. Last week it became clear Bettany would not be called, despite a toxic mouthful of 2013 texts between the WandaVision actor and Depp attacking Heard were read out in court here, as they were in the UK action. Franco and Musk are not expected to take the stand in person or virtually either now. What will undoubtedly come up again is Depp’s insistence that Heard’s WaPo op-ed “destroyed” his career and cost him lucrative roles in top tier movies such as a still yet-unmade sixth Pirates of the Caribbean flick — even though it seems he was never officially asked to return to the Disney distributed franchise. As his lawyers have pressed in the five-week trial that started on April 11, Depp has said over and over since mid-2019 that in fact he was the victim of domestic abuse in the relationship, not Heard. Of note, Depp and Heard’s 2016 divorce was characterized by such allegations on her part and a restraining order against the past Oscar nominee. Yet, even after releasing a joint statement on the end of the relationship, Depp never brought up such topics publicly until after the op-ed was published. With testimony via video link and live in the courtroom, including a security guard who said he saw Heard punch Depp in 2015, the plaintiff’s side inched towards the end of its case on Monday. The day’s session ended with a February 4 2022 video deposition from Erin Falati, also known under her maiden name Erin Boerum, who was a former nurse to the couple. Apparently, the last witness for the plaintiff, the deposition of Heard’s former personal nurse will pick up on Tuesday morning.

5/3/2022,"A housing market slump looked all but assured two years ago. At the time, it made sense: The strict state-issued lockdowns had pushed the U.S. unemployment rate to its highest level since the Great Depression era and many states had banned in-person home showings altogether. However, a housing bust didn't come to pass. Both Congress and the Federal Reserve stepped in with unprecedented economic aid, and after just two months of recession the U.S. economy and housing market flipped into high growth. But the ongoing housing boom—which has seen home prices climb 34% over the past two years—could soon wind down. At least that's according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate from Congress: Maintain maximum employment and keep prices stable. Of course, with inflation at its highest level in 40 years, there's no doubt which of the Fed's mandates currently tops its priority list. An inflation-fighting Fed has big implications for the U.S. housing market, Zandi says. Already, the Federal Reserve is putting upward pressure on mortgage rates as a way to rein in price growth in the housing market and the broader economy. Indeed, over the past two months, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has spiked from 3.11% to 5.1%. That swift uptick in mortgage rates amounts to an economic shock to the red-hot housing market. We're already starting to see it soften the market a bit. In the coming months, Zandi says that cooling should only intensify. By this time next year, he predicts, year-over-year home price growth will be at zero. At this point, Zandi doesn't foresee a national home price correction. However, he does believe some of the nation's most overpriced housing markets could see home prices decline up to 10% over the coming year. To get an indication of which housing markets are at risk of a home price correction, Fortune asked Moody's Analytics for its proprietary analysis of U.S. housing markets. The firm aimed to find out whether local income levels could support local home prices. The finding? Of the 392 metropolitan statistical areas it looked at, 96% are ""overvalued"". Among those 392 markets, 149 are overvalued by at least 25%. The most overvalued being Boise, where home prices are 73% above what fundamentals would support. The fact Boise is ""overvalued"" relative to local incomes isn't surprising given the influx of out-of-state California expats who bought there during the pandemic. View this interactive chart on Fortune.com Over time, regional housing markets can't remain ""overvalued"" to this degree, Zandi says. That should be a drag on future home price growth. ""In terms of house prices, I expect it [growth] to go flat…there will be markets where we will see a price decline of around 5% to 10%,"" Zandi says. While he doesn't foresee the ongoing boom as a housing bubble—which would require both home price overvaluation and speculation in the market—he does say there is some ""speculation creeping in"" including in places like Phoenix and Charlotte. According to Moody's Analytics' analysis, Phoenix and Charlotte are overvalued by 46% and 33%, respectively. Moody's Analytics isn't the only firm calling this an overvalued housing market. CoreLogic, a real estate research company based in California, provided an analysis to Fortune last month that found 65% of regional housing markets are overpriced. Meanwhile, an analysis provided by Black Knight, a mortgage technology and data provider, finds the typical American household would have to spend 31% of its monthly income to make a mortgage payment on the average-priced U.S. home. That's the highest reading of Black Knight's mortgage-payment-to-income ratio since 2007. While CoreLogic and Moody's Analytics agree the housing market is overvalued, CoreLogic isn't quite as bearish. The real estate research firm says only 3% of housing markets have an ""elevated"" or ""high"" chance of seeing home price declines over the coming year. Nationally, CoreLogic expects home price growth to jump another 5% over the coming 12 months. That would mark a deceleration from the latest 12-month home price jump (19.8%), however, it'd hardly be the relief home shoppers seek. ""New listings have not kept up with the large number of families looking to buy, leading to homes selling quickly and often above list price. This imbalance between an insufficient number of owners looking to sell relative to buyers searching for a home has led to the record appreciation of the past 12 months,"" wrote Frank Nothaft, chief economist at CoreLogic, in a report published last month. ""Higher prices and mortgage rates erode buyer affordability and should dampen demand in coming months, leading to the moderation in price growth in our forecast."" As Fortune has previously reported, it may be wise to take all housing forecasts with a grain of salt. After all, when the COVID-19 recession struck in spring 2020, both Zillow and CoreLogic published housing forecast models predicting that U.S. home prices would fall by spring 2021. It didn't happen. Instead, the housing market boomed. If you’re hungry for more housing data, follow me on Twitter at @NewsLambert.

5/3/2022,"Spotting a tick on your body can be borderline terrifying. After all, not only can the insect suck your blood, it can also carry a range of potentially serious diseases like Lyme disease and babesiosis. Naturally, you’ll want to remove the tick ASAP but sometimes the bug can break, leaving you with the tick’s mouth-parts embedded in your skin. Not only is that gross, it could raise your risk of getting sick. “The more of a tick that’s removed, the less likely it is to be able to spread a pathogen,” says infectious disease expert Amesh A. Adalja, M.D., senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Meaning, you really want to try to remove the whole tick—including the head—if you can. So, how do you remove a tick head after getting a tick bite? Here’s what you need to know. The best way to avoid having to figure out how to remove a tick head is to get the whole tick out in the first place. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends doing the following: Use clean, fine-tipped tweezers to grab the tick as close to your skin’s surface as possible. Pull upward with steady, even pressure. (Don’t twist or jerk the tick—that can cause the can cause the head and mouth-parts to break off and stay in your the skin. Get rid of the tick by putting it in alcohol, placing it in a sealed bag or container, wrapping it tightly in tape, or flushing it down the toilet. For what it’s worth, ticks don’t actually embed their head in your skin—instead, the area they use to break your skin is called their “mouth-parts.” Even when you’re careful, sometimes the tick’s mouth-parts can break off. If that happens, the CDC recommends doing your best to remove it from your skin with tweezers. “If the head isn’t easily removed, it’s not a good idea to dig around in there and try to fish it out,” says Philip Henderson, M.D., an internal medicine physician with Spectrum Health. “You could be pushing more of that organism into your skin.” Eric Adkins, M.D., an emergency medicine physician at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, says you can pull the head “out like a splinter” if it’s easily accessible. But, he adds, “you shouldn’t spend a lot of time trying to pull something out that isn’t coming out easily” or you could risk injuring your skin and causing a localized infection. Dr. Henderson says you can just “leave it alone” if you can’t get everything out, noting that “most of the time, the body pushes it out.” You’ve probably heard that it’s crucial to remove the tick head if it stays in your skin, but Dr. Adalja says you shouldn’t panic. “If part of the body breaks of when you pull it off, it’s not a very major issue,” he says. He recommends just washing the area with soap and water, or using rubbing alcohol on the site. Worth noting: The tick will die after its mouth-parts break off, says Nancy Troyano, Ph.D., board-certified entomologist and director of operations education and training for Ehrlich Pest Control. ""The tick will die, as it cannot regenerate mouth-parts,"" Troyano says. ""A tick will die of starvation, if not from the injury, when the body breaks off from the mouth part,"" adds Glen Ramsey, senior technical manager at Orkin. If you happen to spot a tick on your dog, the American Kennel Club (AKC) recommends taking a similar approach to removing it: Spread your dog’s fur, and grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible using fine-point tweezers or tick-removal hook. Very gently, pull straight upward, in a slow, steady motion. Dispose of the tick. There are a lot of different hacks listed online for removing a tick, including one that suggests removing the tick with Vaseline. The idea behind it is that the tick will be irritated by the Vaseline and detach, but the CDC specifically recommends against trying this. “It’s definitely not the best method,” Dr. Henderson says, pointing out that you really want to remove a tick ASAP and this hack can take a while to work. “When you put Vaseline on the tick, it can take longer than 48 hours for the tick to back out,” he says. Dr. Adkins agrees. “Tweezers are the answer,” he says. If you’re able to get the tick head out, you’ll want to dispose of it the same way you do the body (i.e. put it in alcohol, place it in a sealed bag or container, wrap it in tape, or flush it down the toilet). Then, the CDC recommends that you “thoroughly” clean the bite area and your hands with rubbing alcohol or soap and water. Once the tick is out of you, Dr. Adkins recommends keeping tabs on your health to see if you develop any symptoms, like feeling tired or unwell. You also want to look out for a fever or rash within a couple of weeks after you were bitten, says Aline M. Holmes, D.N.P., R.N., a clinical associate professor at Rutgers University School of Nursing. If that happens, “see your provider and tell them about the tick bite and where it is,” she says. If you feel OK and you’ve gotten the tick out, Dr. Adkins says there's no need to take any additional steps. “Folks should be able to go on with life as usual once they’ve gotten the tick out,” he says.
