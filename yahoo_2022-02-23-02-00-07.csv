2/23/2022,"Hours after eating leftovers from a restaurant, a 19-year-old was admitted to the hospital with multiple organ failure and had both his legs and all his fingers amputated. The Massachusetts college student had eaten rice, chicken and lo mein from a restaurant. Soon after, he felt abdominal pain and his skin turned a shade of purple, according to a report by The New England Journal of Medicine. The teenager was admitted to a hospital for ""shock, multiple organ failure, and rash,” and his condition quickly declined. He experienced abnormal breathing, high blood pressure and vomiting. The student had been healthy overall with regular drinking and smoking habits, the report said. After further tests, he was diagnosed with meningococcal disease, which caused his stiff neck, nausea, respiratory collapse, shock and organ failure, according to the report.

The Centers for Disease and Control Prevention warns it can “lead to death in as little as a few hours.” Over the course of his hospital stay, his condition worsened and he developed necrosis, the death of tissue and cells. At that point, doctors had to amputate his legs and fingers, according to the report. He also needed a pacemaker for 13 days to treat his cardiac dysfunction. Experts have warned against how to properly store leftover rice because items such as rice and pasta contain a bacterium called Bacillus cereus. The bacteria produces a toxin when heated and left out too long, according to the CDC. In 2019, a teenager died in his sleep after eating leftover pasta that wasn't refrigerated overnight, a case that was reported in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology. The medical team learned that although the Massachusetts student had received a first dose of the meningococcal vaccine, he never received the recommended booster. His roommate also ate the leftover food and vomited but didn't have life-threatening reactions.

2/23/2022,"Of all the former secretaries of state under Democratic and Republican presidents, only one is taking to cable news and social media during a moment of peril in Europe to praise Russian President Vladimir Putin and chastise the Biden administration. Mike Pompeo has lauded the Russian strongman over the past month as a “talented,” “savvy,” “capable statesman,” offering his praise during a slew of interviews after his political action committee spent $30,000 on improving his performance in media appearances. “He is a very talented statesman. He has lots of gifts,” Pompeo told Fox News in January. “He was a KGB agent, for goodness sakes. He knows how to use power. We should respect that.” On Monday, Putin declared two regions of eastern Ukraine as “independent” after supporting a violent separatist movement there over the past eight years. Since the fall, he has steadily amassed nearly 200,000 troops along Ukraine’s east, north and south – nearly 70% of Russia’s entire ground force – and in recent days placed battalions in tactical positions for an imminent, full-scale invasion, according to U.S. officials. A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers have traveled to Ukraine in recent weeks to express a unified American voice of support, and are working on legislation that would provide President Joe Biden with new sanctions tools to punish Russia if it further invades the country. Few other former secretaries of state have weighed in on the crisis, and those that have avoided politics. Condoleeza Rice, former secretary of state under President George W. Bush, called Putin “megalomaniacal” in a CNN interview over the weekend. There have been eight U.S. secretaries of state since Putin took power in 1999, including four under Republican presidents — Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, Rex Tillerson and Pompeo — and four under Democratic presidents — Madeleine Albright, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and the current secretary, Antony Blinken. To the contrary, Pompeo has targeted Biden as exemplifying “enormous weakness,” leading “an America on its back, an America that apologizes.” He asserts that Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan and response to a ransomware hack of the Colonial pipeline last year contributed to Putin’s confidence. Putin is “very shrewd. Very capable,” Pompeo said in another recent interview with the Center for the National Interest. “I have enormous respect for him – I’ve been criticized for saying that.” In the past, former President Donald Trump’s secretary of state has privately dismissed Ukraine as insignificant in U.S. domestic politics. After an interview with an NPR reporter in 2020, Pompeo, then still secretary, pulled the reporter aside to curse at her for her questions, and demanded she identify Ukraine on an unmarked map. “Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?” he asked her. Pompeo has been visiting key primary states ahead of a potential run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024. He has worked to increase his media profile since leaving office, losing 90 pounds in six months, joining Fox News as a contributor and staying active on the speakers circuit. His praise of Putin comes amid a debate within the Republican Party over whether Russia is a friend or foe. Major figures in the GOP, including Trump and Fox News host Tucker Carlson, have for years defended Putin and criticized Ukrainian leadership. In yet another recent interview, Pompeo explained that respecting Putin “doesn’t mean we should love him, like him, or bend a knee to him.” “But we shouldn’t treat him as the JV,” Pompeo said. “He is a credible, capable statesman. And that’s why the mistake of not putting deterrence in place over the last year has led to this moment that we’re suffering from today.” On Monday night, after Putin delivered a speech describing Ukraine as a Russian invention, Pompeo did assign blame for the current crisis to the Russians. “Vladimir Putin is the aggressor,” he wrote on Twitter. “The Ukrainians are the victims. We should never shy away from that.”",Politics/Kansas City Star,Only one former secretary of state is praising Putin and criticizing Biden in Ukraine crisis,https://news.yahoo.com/only-one-former-secretary-state-160444530.html
2/23/2022,"Having made a big deal of the fact that despite having COVID the queen would continue to work as normal, Buckingham Palace was forced onto the back foot Tuesday with a dramatic announcement that the monarch was not going to be hosting remote audiences as scheduled after all. In a statement the palace said: “As Her Majesty is still experiencing mild cold like symptoms she has decided not to undertake her planned virtual engagements today, but will continue with light duties.” The palace has consistently declined to offer what sources privately describe as a “running commentary” on Her Majesty’s health. However, her wellbeing has been a renewed topic of speculation in the British press—hardly surprising given her age (95) and the constitutional implications of her passing—ever since it was revealed that her son Prince Charles had contracted coronavirus on February 10, and had met with his mother on February 8, when he was possibly infectious, but ignorant of that fact. There has been much sympathy for Charles, who may also have inadvertently spread the virus to his wife—went down with a positive diagnosis—as he was not only triple vaccinated but also actually caught COVID in the first wave of the disease to hit the U.K. in 2020. The queen was subsequently diagnosed with coronavirus, with an announcement being made to that effect on Sunday Feb 20. However the palace was quick to brief reporters over the weekend that the queen was not severely ill, and hinted that it was not Charles who had given her the disease, referring royal reporters instead to a cluster of cases among the “team” at Windsor Castle. Given the unpredictability of the progress of the disease in different individuals, there were question marks over the wisdom of sources also briefing the media that the queen would continue to work through her illness, with fears the strategy left Her Majesty a hostage to fortune. Those forebodings have now been proved justified with sceptics wondering just how much store should be set the palace’s insistence that the queen is still only affected by “mild cold like symptoms” given that the same formulation of words was used on Sunday. If nothing has changed, why the change to the schedule? The mortality of the contemporary monarch has been a subject of fascination for the British people for millennia, and Queen Elizabeth’s advanced age periodically raises speculation to fever pitch when she is officially confirmed to be unwell. Although she is remarkably active for a person of her age, she has endured a series of health scares since the death of her husband last year. In October she was ordered off work, and spent a night in hospital, which the palace initially tried to cover up, citing medical privacy. Fear of contracting the coronavirus has led to the queen only conducting very modest and small in-person engagements since then, and she is being attended by a core group of 22 quarantined staff, dubbed HMS Bubble, who relieve each other in shifts and are regularly tested for COVID. Last week, the queen told visitors she was having trouble with her mobility. The palace downplayed the incident but video of the queen saying, “I can’t move,” and pointing at her leg did little to dampen the endless speculation. Read more at The Daily Beast.
