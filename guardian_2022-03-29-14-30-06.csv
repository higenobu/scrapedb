3/29/2022,"Australia’s medical regulator has said it is investigating the AFL’s former concussion adviser and world-renowned concussion expert, neurologist Dr Paul McCrory. McCrory resigned as chair of the Concussion in Sport Group on 5 March after being accused of plagiarising stories in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, with the journal removing one of his editorials from 2005 for alleged “unlawful and indefensible breach of copyright” of the work of Prof Steve Haake. McCrory has since been accused of further plagiarism, and reportedly apologised, telling website Retraction Watch that he had requested the papers in question be retracted and “the errors were not deliberate or intentional”. It is understood that the investigation by the medical regulator does not relate to the plagiarism allegations. McCrory has not responded to questions about the allegations from Guardian Australia. Separately, on 16 March, the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency [Ahpra] told Guardian Australia that in May 2018 McCrory “provided an enforceable undertaking to the Medical Board of Australia that he will not perform neurodiagnostic procedures, nerve conduction studies, or electromyography until approved to do so by the board”. That undertaking is still in effect. Ahpra said privacy provisions in the national law prevent the agency from revealing why the undertaking was given. Ahpra said that, speaking generally, medical regulatory agencies “can accept an undertaking from a practitioner to limit the practitioner’s practice in some way if this is necessary to protect the public”. “An undertaking is voluntarily entered into by a practitioner as opposed to a ‘condition’, which is imposed on a practitioner’s registration.” They added that “current undertakings which relate to a practitioner’s health are mentioned on the national register but details are not provided”. Guardian Australia does not suggest that there is any issue with McCrory’s health or that his professional practice poses any risk to the public. McCrory has not responded to questions from Guardian Australia as to why he provided the enforced undertaking. The undertaking does not prevent McCrory from working as a neurologist or seeing patients, but means he can not perform the procedures listed as part of the undertaking. An AFL spokesperson said McCrory ceased to be involved with the league’s concussion committees or working groups in January 2021, and has not been involved in such a capacity with the league since. The spokesperson said McCrory continues to see past and present AFL players on referral from club doctors and GPs but does so in a private consulting capacity without funding from the AFL and without any reporting obligation to the AFL. A practice manager at the Neurology Network in Melbourne, where McCrory has a private practice, said; “To our knowledge, he has conducted his practice consistent with his level of accreditation”. However, on Tuesday an Ahpra spokesperson told Guardian Australia that McCrory is being investigated. In recent weeks, players have spoken to the media describing the medical treatment they received from McCrory for their concussion injuries. The Ahpra spokesperson said they were limited in what they could say publicly but were “aware of allegations in the media” about McCrory’s compliance with the undertaking on his registration. “We take such allegations seriously and will be investigating them. “We cannot comment further.” On Thursday the AFL announced a comprehensive and independent review of McCrory’s work, including his clinical treatment of players. An AFL spokesperson said: “As is common practice in academic institutions and other organisations in which allegations of plagiarism are made or admitted, the AFL believes it is important as a matter of integrity to ascertain the status and the reliability of past research activities and outcomes, and clinical work in which Dr McCrory has been involved for the AFL.” Guardian Australia revealed on Friday that the league has been unable to answer questions from former players asking the AFL what became of AFL-led concussion studies they took part in, and how their sensitive medical data including brain scans, were used. Repeated requests for answers to questions about those studies from Guardian Australia have also gone unanswered.

3/29/2022,"A coalition of MPs and peers from a host of different parties have called on the European court of human rights to challenge an alleged failure to investigate Russian interference in UK elections. The legal action has been launched in response to the government’s refusal to order an inquiry into the findings of the Russia report, published by the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) in July 2020, which reported credible evidence of attempts by Russia to interfere with the UK’s electoral processes.The parliamentary group bringing the action includes Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, former leader of the Green party Caroline Lucas, SNP MP Alyn Smith, Lord Strasburger of the Lib Dems and former Tory peer Lady Wheatcroft. The group claims the government is in breach of the European convention on human rights, article 3, which requires regular, free, secret-ballot elections which “ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people”. Lucas, the MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: “As President Putin wages a war of terror on the Ukrainian people, he’s been waging another war on the very principles of democracy. “The Russia report is clear that there is credible evidence of Russian interference in UK electoral process – and yet our government has consistently refused to investigate these serious conclusions.” The Russia report declared Russian interference in the UK “the new normal” and reported credible attempts to interfere with the UK’s electoral processes from at least the time of the EU referendum in 2016. The ISC called for an investigation and an updated legal and institutional framework to protect those processes from foreign interference.When the government did not act on these recommendations, the cross-parliamentary group joined forces with non-profit journalism organisation the Citizens to file an application for judicial review in August 2020. Permission for judicial review was refused by the high court and the group’s application for permission to appeal was turned down by the court of appeal.Lucas said: “We now have no other option than to take our case to the European court of human rights, in order to try to force the government to undertake a full investigation into the evidence, or else we jeopardise the free and fair elections we hold dear and allow Putin to believe that, once again, he can get away with hostile state interference in our democratic processes.” Lord Strasburger said: “For some time it has been obvious that Putin has infiltrated the British establishment and our government. “Predictably Boris Johnson delayed publication of the Russia report as long as he could and then ignored its excellent recommendations. “Likewise he declined to tackle the tsunami of dirty money the Russian oligarchs have been allowed to launder in London and only moved against them when the Ukraine crisis meant he had no choice. “Even then he did as little as he could get away with and gave the oligarchs ample time to spirit their assets out of the country. It’s high time to deal with this vipers’ nest and hopefully this legal action will lead to full exposure.” The long-delayed Russia report found the British government and intelligence agencies failed to conduct any proper assessment of Kremlin attempts to interfere with the 2016 Brexit referendum. It said the government “had not seen or sought evidence of successful interference in UK democratic processes” at the time, and it made clear that no serious effort was made to do so.",News/Law,European court urged to challenge UK failure to investigate Russia interference ,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/mar/29/european-court-urged-to-challenge-uk-failure-to-investigate-russia-interference
3/29/2022,"At this point in his gilded career, Chris Rock doesn’t take an Oscars gig for the clout. He takes it for the check. And the 57-year-old funnyman made clear from the moment he took LA’s Dolby Theatre stage to present the prize for best feature documentary that he wouldn’t be sweating for it. Rather than launch into a meticulous bit that might remind the world why he was once so big that he hosted this program all by himself twice, he made fun of the crowd – hack moves. He singled out Jada Pinkett Smith, who has alopecia, maligning her with a near 30-year-old movie reference, and everyone in the room laughed on reflex – because he’s Chris Rock. For his brief guest spot to end with Will Smith slapping him on live television and then heckling him from a front-row seat in some ways speaks to how much the comedy legend has slipped. (Smith apologized to Rock in an Instagram post on Monday.) Back when GI Jane was water-cooler conversation, Rock was making a credible case as an all-time great comedian – the skinny, indignant kid from Crown Heights, Brooklyn, who clicked up with Eddie Murphy as a teen and followed him on to Saturday Night Live by his mid-20s before his star became a supernova. But over the past decades, that star has greatly faded, as Kevin Hart has seized the box office mantle and Dave Chappelle has entrenched himself as America’s most talked-about comedian. The fact that Rock will be touring jointly with Hart this summer seems to suggest that he can’t draw a crowd on his own any more – an idea that would have seemed unimaginable when he was roasting the Academy for its lack of diversity while hosting the Oscars in 2005. While Rock is still a legit A-lister, one who stars in his own season of Fargo when he isn’t lending his voice to albums by Ye or Little Nas X, he isn’t exactly a cultural force these days. Rock is one to joke about Will Smith getting $20m to do Wild Wild West. Netflix gave Rock twice that in 2016 to deliver a pair of comedy specials. And while the first, 2018’s Tambourine, earned Rock a Grammy nomination, he nonetheless came off relatively muted – tonally and sartorially – and somewhat diminished while whinging about women and stewing about the breakup of his marriage. (This was after Rock ranted about the millions he lost in his divorce in a 2017 interview on Scandinavian TV.) Rock’s whole schtick – the pained but personable indignation, the pop culture references, the pentecostal delivery – has aged poorly. Worse, it doesn’t seem as if he can stop himself from punching down or pulling back the blows at his own people. And as he got rich, he was goading his audiences. Alas, Will Smith took the bait. But at his peak? Few could follow Rock when he was actually trying. A trio of standalone comedy specials for HBO marked him as a piercing cultural critic with a skill for parsing the world from an unapologetically Black perspective, prowling the stage in head-to-toe leather in homage to Murphy’s Delirious. Rock’s 12-minute monologue in his 1996 special Bring the Pain might be one of the best known comedy bits in history. In the second episode of the American version of The Office, Michael Scott’s performance of the routine leads to a day-long racial sensitivity seminar. The purposefully awkward spoof, besides being brilliant in its own right, speaks to Rock’s hip-hop swagger. He wasn’t just letting rap lyrics inspire the names of his specials or making fun of artist beefs from the standup stage; he was also making the kind of edgy content that was so catchy that white fans couldn’t help repeating it in public, no matter how ill-advised. Bring the Pain, which won two Emmys and a Grammy (as a spoken-word album, Roll with the New) established Rock as a critical darling and a commercial powerhouse. He went from playing basketball-arena crowds to headlining major motion pictures opposite the likes of Morgan Freeman and Alan Rickman to producing and narrating the biographical Fox sitcom Everybody Hates Chris – which launched Abbott Elementary’s Tyler James Williams, propelled The Neighborhood’s Tichina Arnold and established the series co-creator Ali LeRoi. Rock advocated for collaborators like Wanda Sykes, who got her start as an actor-writer on The Chris Rock Show. During its two-season run through the late 90s, there was nothing on TV that matched The Chris Rock Show’s mix of politically incorrect sketches (offensively named cereal, Halle Berry 911), straight-faced man-on-the-street reports (on the Tiger Woods effect in Harlem, on his own campaign to bust Bobby Brown out of jail), popular music showcases (Missy Elliott, Prince) and celebrity interviews. In the season 2 finale, Rock sat down with Jada Pinkett Smith, then fresh off an appearance in Scream 2. After needling Pinkett about her big-brimmed hat, he returned to an earlier joke about her attending the Million Woman March – a concept he couldn’t get his head around. “Did you catch any sales?” he cracked. At the end a game-show buzzer sounded and a stage hand brought out a bottle of champagne. “You just did an interview without mentioning the name Will Smith!” he enthused. (“That’s terrible!” she said.) Among other things, it spared Rock having to talk about the time he appeared in drag as Will’s love interest in the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air as he was still finding himself post-SNL. After the HBO show ran its course, Rock dived into film producing, developing Head of State, Pootie Tang and other crude comedies before acquiring a taste for richer fare and the urge to direct. But despite highbrow ambitions and an encouraging stage acting run in the 2011 Broadway production of The Motherfucker with the Hat, Rock never could quite resist the temptation to go lowbrow. Death at a Funeral not only put a Black American spin on the dark British comedy, it kept Peter Dinklage on to make sure the joke at the heart of the film paid off. In I Think I Love My Wife, a reboot of a classic French film, Rock casted women as the root of all evil. And then of course he went on and made Good Hair, which does far more to put down Black women than uplift them. Interestingly, Rock co-wrote I Think I Love My Wife with Louis CK – who worked with Rock on the HBO show and directed him in Pootie Tang. In a 2011 HBO special called Funny People, they appear on a roundtable discussion that also includes Ricky Gervais and Jerry Seinfeld. In one exchange Rock calls Louis CK “the blackest white guy I fucking know”. Louis CK asks if Rock is calling him the N-word, to peals of laughter from Gervais – who repeats the word. Meanwhile, Seinfeld squirms and pushes for a subject change. Ten years ago, an awards show producer would have killed to get one of those comics to host. Now they belong to a class of comedians that would sooner turn off viewers than compel them to tune in. Success has made Rock too out of touch, too rich. And now he’s in a weird space – still a distinctive voice, but not all that thought provoking. For the comic whose material once defined a generation, that’s the real slap in the face.",Arts/Stage,Chris Rock once defined a generation – but his schtick has aged poorly,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/28/chris-rock-comedy-career-will-smith
3/29/2022,"An artificial intelligence has beaten eight world champions at bridge, a game in which human supremacy has resisted the march of the machines until now. The victory represents a new milestone for AI because in bridge players work with incomplete information and must react to the behaviour of several other players – a scenario far closer to human decision-making. In contrast, chess and Go – in both of which AIs have already beaten human champions – a player has a single opponent at a time and both are in possession of all the information. “What we’ve seen represents a fundamentally important advance in the state of artificial intelligence systems,” said Stephen Muggleton, a professor of machine learning at Imperial College London. French startup NukkAI announced the news of its AI’s victory on Friday, at the end of a two-day tournament in Paris. The NukkAI challenge required the human champions to play 800 consecutive deals divided into 80 sets of 10. It did not involve the initial bidding component of the game during which players arrive at a contract that they must then meet by playing their cards. Each champion played their own and their “dummy” partner’s cards against a pair of opponents. These opponents were the best robot champions in the world to date – robots that have won many robot competitions but that are universally acknowledged to be nowhere near as good as expert human players. The AI – called NooK – played the same role as the human champion, with the same cards and the same opponents. The score was the difference between those of the human and the AI, averaged over each set. NooK won 67, or 83%, of the 80 sets. Jean-Baptiste Fantun, co-founder of NukkAI, said he had been confident the machine – which the company has been developing for five years – would triumph in thousands of deals, but with only 800 it was touch-and-go. Announcing the results, the mathematician Cédric Villani, winner of the Fields medal in 2010, called NukkAI “a superb French success story”. AI researcher Véronique Ventos, NukkAI’s other co-founder, calls NooK a “new generation AI” because it explains its decisions as it goes along. “In bridge, you can’t play if you don’t explain,” she says. The game relies on communication between partners. Explainability is a hot topic in AI. “Most of what the general public have heard in recent years about machine learning is based on black box systems such as AlphaGo, which is unable to explain to human beings how decisions are being made,” said Muggleton. Instead, NooK represents a “white box” or “neurosymbolic” approach. Rather than learning by playing billions of rounds of a game, it first learns the game’s rules and then improves its play through practice. It is a hybrid of rules-based and deep learning systems. “The NooK approach learns in a way that is much closer to human beings,” Muggleton said. “The pendulum is swinging towards these kinds of methods,” says Michael Littman, a professor of computer science at Brown University in Rhode Island. “Not being able to tell people what’s going on just doesn’t work in our societies.” Even if a person or an AI can’t explain in words what they are doing, Littman says, their behaviour needs to be “legible” to others – enacting rules they understand. This will be critical in domains such as health and engineering. Self-driving cars negotiating a junction will need to be able to read each other’s behaviour, for example. Littman was disappointed the challenge didn’t include bidding, which is where much of the most interesting communication – and deception – happens in bridge. But Nevena Senior, a many-times world bridge champion for England and one of NooK’s challengers, said the contracts the humans and NooK were given to play were sufficiently variable that the card game became as important as the bidding. She said NooK’s creators had done a “magnificent” job. She found that it read its opponents better than the humans did, and was better able to exploit their mistakes. “This is something that humans do after enough experience and I was pleasantly surprised that a robot mimics typical human skills,” she said. 1996: IBM’s Deep Blue chess machine wins a game against world chess champion Garry Kasparov but loses the match 2-4.

3/29/2022,"It should be celebrated as one of England’s most important buildings but even its most fervent cheerleaders would admit that Clifford’s Tower has long been a terrible place to visit. From the weekend that will no longer be the case, English Heritage hopes, as the covers come off a £5m transformation radically altering the building’s interior. Clifford’s Tower is all that remains of York Castle, which was the centre of government in the north of England for 500 years, from the middle ages up to the 17th century. The 800-year-old landmark has a rich, fascinating and at times shocking history. It still dominates the city of York and has glorious views, better even than those from the tower of York Minster – not least because you can see the Minster. The tower should be a jewel in the crown of English Heritage but was more like a problem, said Jeremy Ashbee, head properties curator. “It wasn’t a good visitor experience” he said. “The visitor numbers were high but the feedback was abysmal and no one ever came back. The people of York didn’t like it and said so.” Clifford’s Tower has been an empty shell since it was gutted by a mysterious fire in 1684 when it was used as a store for armaments and gunpowder. Visitors reach it by climbing 55 steep steps up a grassy mound. Previously they were greeted by an open courtyard and minimal interpretation. A stone circular staircase takes people further up to a wall walk that was very narrow, said architect Hugh Broughton. “It has amazing views over York but people found themselves shuffling single-file round it and then back out of the tower. They were somewhat underwhelmed by the quality of their visit.” The whole Clifford’s Tower experience might have been no more than a 10-15 minute diversion, if that. Broughton’s answer to the problem of Clifford’s Tower has been to install within it a free-standing timber structure that has elegant aerial walkways. It opens up hidden rooms not seen for 300 years while a new roof deck allows people to properly enjoy the views at their leisure. On the mound staircase, new handrails and resting points have been added. The idea was to still celebrate the building for what it was: a ruin. “We’re not pretending that we’ve made Clifford’s Tower into a royal palace,” said Broughton. The stone tower was built in the 13th century for King Henry III, a lover of luxury who was, Ashbee said, “a good man but a bad king”. Henry loved his creature comforts including one that can – thanks to the revamp – be seen properly for the first time in centuries. “It is missing only its timber seat,” said conservation architect Martin Ashley of Henry’s impressive garderobe or toilet. “It has even got a little toiletries cupboard. The remarkable thing is that there is a flushing spout because it was an automatic flushing 13th-century lavatory.” Ashley said the toilet had been sensitively cleaned, with centuries of pollution removed. There is new interpretation telling the tower’s history including it being the site of one of the worst antisemitic episodes in English history when, in 1190, members of York’s Jewish community took their own lives rather than be killed by the mob. The “gentle touch” approach to Clifford’s Tower follows an outcry in 2018 over plans – later abandoned – to build a visitors’ centre at the base of the grassy mound. The project had been an important one, said Ashbee, as Clifford’s Tower deserved to be seen as one of England’s most important buildings. “The tower is one of those places that we can genuinely say is exceptional,” the curator said. “It is undeniably a place of national as well as regional significance. Some might even argue, a place of international significance. It has an important story, which needs to be told properly.”",News/UK news,Clifford’s Tower in York to reopen after radical £5m transformation,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/29/cliffords-tower-york-reopen-radical-transformation-english-heritage
3/29/2022,"Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley and others with alopecia have spoken out about Will Smith hitting Chris Rock at the Oscars, after Rock joked about Jada Pinkett Smith’s short hair. Pinkett Smith has talked about living with alopecia-related hair loss. Pressley, who in 2020 opened up about her own journey with alopecia, shared her thoughts on Twitter on Sunday night. Emphasizing that she does not condone violence, Pressley wrote: “Let’s talk about what it’s like to live with [alopecia]. The deeply vulnerable [and] difficult moments that our families see. Appreciation post for those who hold us down & support us when we’re at our lowest points. They see us, fully.” Pressley continued: “Our bodies are not public domain. They are not a line in a joke – especially when the transformation is not of our choosing. I’m a survivor of violence. I’m a proud alopecian. The psychological toll we carry daily is real. Team Jada always. That’s that on that.” Others with alopecia have shared similar messages criticizing Rock’s comments on Smith’s appearance. Golden, a poet and photographer, tweeted about being diagnosed with alopecia areata in seventh grade and the harassment they endured: “People bullied me for years for something I couldn’t control – I wish more people would’ve defended me/advocated for me when I was a child.” Speaking on how family support allowed them to regain their confidence following bullying as their hair loss progressed, Golden said that they do not blame Smith for defending Jada. They wrote: “In a world where bullying [and] suicide is prevalent, we have to stop acting like ableist jokes aren’t violent/harmful. We have to stop using black women for publicity punch lines as if we don’t have feelings. We can be fragile, vulnerable, [and] just be trying to make it to tomorrow too.” National organizations that focus on alopecia advocacy have also spoken about the incident. The National Alopecia Areata Foundation said: “Many people living with the condition are suffering, and we must do better to support this community and erase the stigma, discrimination, and societal barriers that persist.” The organization said alopecia areata affects 7 million Americans and 147 million people worldwide. It encouraged more education to help “end the stigma”. The charity Alopecia UK said it does not condone violence and emphasized demeaning remarks that many with alopecia face. “Dealing with unwelcome remarks and being the butt of jokes is sadly an all too real part of having alopecia. This just adds to the distress and challenges faced by people with alopecia,” said the organization. Jeff Woytovich, founder of the Children’s Alopecia Project, said Smith’s conduct divided opinion. He said: “The thing is, somebody said something that was negative to somebody who had a medical diagnosis of alopecia … and that happens to kids all over the world, every single day.” Woytovich said Rock’s comments were more than a harmless joke. Woytovich said Rock’s “GI Jane” joke could be used by children to bully others. “GI Jane could be used as a derogatory remark to a little girl with alopecia, and I just thought to myself [that] something as simple as a little joke could actually have such impact,” said Woytovich. He said the focus on Smith hitting Rock has taken away attention from raising awareness about the autoimmune condition. “We would love to have Will Smith – and Chris Rock – stand up for those kids with alopecia and make sure that there’s somebody there to fight, not literally, but figuratively, for these kids,” said Woytovich.",News/US news,Calls to ‘end the stigma’ around alopecia after Chris Rock Oscars joke,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/29/chris-rock-will-smith-jada-pinkett-smith-alopecia
3/29/2022,"So, is that it? After wave upon wave of infections, the combination of vaccination and Omicron’s comparatively mild (though still serious) properties has led the UK to declare the pandemic, essentially, over. After two lockdowns, a huge burden on healthcare and at last an extremely prompt and effective vaccination campaign, the UK has still registered more than 160,000 lives lost to the pandemic, roughly half of them in the Alpha wave. And in case you hadn’t noticed, “herd immunity”, much like Godot, has stubbornly failed to arrive and expel the virus from the population. Nobody should be under any illusions that it could have been much worse. Poor Peru was hit by dreadful waves of infection before vaccines could be deployed; it has lost roughly three times as many people as the UK, accounting for population. It should be astonishing given these facts, but some stubborn voices have continued to argue that in the autumn of 2020 we should have rushed to remove restrictions on all except those most at risk – who would be somehow saved by untested, implausible means gathered together under the heading of “targeted protection”. At that point no vaccines were widely available, and the effective therapies we now have against Covid were pie in the sky. Shockingly, there are now attempts to rehabilitate these ideas in parts of the media. Reaching back to relitigate such already-discredited approaches is nonsense. And worse, it makes reasonable discussions about pandemic management that much harder. Distraction has always been the goal of such revisionism. We saw this around targeted protection, we saw it in early arguments that Covid was “just the flu”, we saw it when many people were still arguing that PCR tests were overcounting cases in the UK in the fall of 2020, even as hospital beds and ventilator wards filled up and the death toll steadily mounted. The point of all those fights was to play down the seriousness of the disease and ultimately to blunt our response to it. It started with saying the pandemic wasn’t a real threat, and, when that became undeniable, it became about declaring it over or past, again and again. As I wrote in April 2020, instead of a single peak, we got a mountain range. Ultimately, these arguments – despite being lost individually – seriously hampered the possibility of a real, sustainable strategy emerging to help us handle the grim pandemic terrain. To want a sustainable strategy is not about being a “Covid hawk”. March 2022 is very different from October 2020. To suggest that restrictions might be relaxed once vaccination has been deployed is a reasonable discussion. Before that point it was guaranteed to lead to more preventable transmission, more serious illness, more hospitalisations and more deaths. How our pandemic response should change is a question I get asked all the time. And my answer is always the same: what do we want to achieve? The minimum is to avoid healthcare being overwhelmed. But healthcare gets compromised when things like elective surgeries and screening are delayed – which will happen if huge numbers of staff and patients are sick. And this has indeed happened, over and again, as a result of uncontrolled transmission of the virus in the community. Here’s a basic pandemic strategy fit for 2022: maintain awareness of the situation with cross-sectional testing of the population to determine how much virus is around, and combine it with wastewater surveillance to spot any rapid changes. Aggressively investigate any new variants because we can expect them, and they could still make a lot of people sick, fast. Make sure people who are in a vulnerable category get treatment early in infection, when it is most likely to help. Above all, emphasise being “up to date” with your vaccination status rather than “fully vaccinated” or “boosted” because we don’t know what might be needed in future. And we should not forget other effective measures that we have known about for ages. A century and a half ago, we started to think seriously about cleaning the water we drank, after repeated cholera epidemics that killed Queen Victoria’s Prince Albert, alongside many others, mostly poor and without a gaudy memorial on the south side of Hyde Park. We could do the same for the air we breathe now with better ventilation. What about improved sick pay? It enables people who are infectious with Covid or anything else to not infect people in the workplace, by staying at home. These interventions would blunt future pandemics of respiratory infections. And they would help in the autumn and winter of this year, when Covid and influenza will be tussling for pole position. Hell, you don’t need to talk about future pandemics to advocate for the benefits of such structural change, it’s clear right now. After almost all interventions were removed, the UK has been predictably buffeted by a wave of BA.2 infections. For now, it appears that the disease is comfortingly similar to BA.1, by which I mean readily handled by the great majority of vaccinated folks. But to insist that future variants will be similar is a gamble, not a policy. Rather than maintaining its world-beating scientific effort to understand the properties of the variants as they emerge, the UK is scaling back funding. It doesn’t end because you want it to.

3/29/2022,"People with type 2 diabetes have a higher risk of 57 other health conditions, including cancer, kidney disease and neurological illnesses, according to the most comprehensive study of its kind. Millions of people worldwide have the condition, which is linked to being overweight or inactive, or having a family history of type 2 diabetes. It is well known that the condition increases the risk of ill health. Now researchers at the University of Cambridge have been able to show the true scale of the risk type 2 diabetes presents. In the most comprehensive observational study of health in middle age involving people with and without type 2 diabetes, experts found the condition was linked to a higher incidence of 57 long-term illnesses. On average, those with the condition had these health problems as many as five years earlier than people without it. Experts described the findings as stark and alarming and said it underlined the urgent need to reduce the risk of more people developing type 2 diabetes. The study, which is yet to be peer-reviewed, is being presented at the Diabetes UK professional conference. Data for 3 million people from the UK Biobank and GP records and 116 illnesses commonly seen in middle age was examined. Those with type 2 diabetes had a higher risk of 57 of the conditions, including a 9% increased risk of cancer. Those with type 2 diabetes were 5.2 times more likely to have end-stage kidney disease, 4.4 times more likely to have liver cancer and 3.2 times more likely to have macular degeneration. When it came to circulatory conditions, those with type 2 diabetes had a higher risk of 23 out of 31 problems. Type 2 diabetes was associated with a higher risk of poor health across all 11 health categories, with a 2.6 times higher risk of neurological issues, a 2.3 times higher risk of eye problems, 1.9 times higher risk of digestive issues and 1.8 times higher risk of mental ill health. The study focused on people over 30. Experts found that higher risks occurred when people were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes under the age of 50. “This study illustrates in alarming detail the unacceptable prevalence of poor health in middle-aged people with type 2 diabetes, and is a stark reminder of the extensive and serious long-term effects of diabetes on the body,” said Dr Elizabeth Robertson, the director of research at Diabetes UK. “That’s why it’s so important that people at increased risk of type 2 diabetes are supported to reduce their risk, and that those living with the condition have continued access to routine care and support to manage it well and avoid or delay complications.” Dr Luanluan Sun, who co-led the research in her former role as a clinical epidemiologist at the University of Cambridge, said it showed preventing and delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes was “essential” to reduce the likelihood of poor health in middle age.",News/Society,"Type 2 diabetes leads to higher risk of 57 other conditions, finds study",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/29/type-2-diabetes-results-higher-risk-57-other-conditions-study
3/29/2022,"Mainstream schools in England will be required to “change their culture and practice” to become more inclusive of children with special educational needs and disabilities, under government proposals designed to end the current postcode lottery. The government will set out plans to overhaul the special educational needs and disabilities (Send) system in a green paper published on Tuesday, including proposals to beef up accountability and boost earlier intervention to ensure that children’s needs are better met in local settings. The paper will also propose the introduction of new national standards across education, health and care to better support children with Send, plus a legal requirement for councils to publish inclusion plans to provide greater clarity about responsibility across the different sectors. The introduction of an “inclusion dashboard” to help parents understand what is available in their area is also among the proposals, as well as a simplified, digitised education, health and care plan for those children with the greatest need to reduce bureaucracy and help parents choose from a list of appropriate placements. The proposals also include plans for a new national framework for banding and tariffs for children requiring different degrees of support to help put the system on a financially sustainable footing. Under the current regime, parents often have to engage in lengthy battles to try to secure the right provision for their child, in a system that is heavily bureaucratic and adversarial. Some specialist provision is only available out of area, leading to costs amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds for the most needy children. Ahead of publication, the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, said: “We want to end the postcode lottery of uncertainty and poor accountability that exists for too many families, boost confidence in the system across the board, and increase local mainstream and specialist education to give parents better choice.” The plans are outlined in the government’s long-awaited green paper, which comes at the end of a cross-government review launched in 2019. Publication will be followed by a 13-week consultation. It will also incorporate alternative provision for children who are unable to access mainstream school for a variety of reasons, including special educational needs, in its vision for a single, national system. Before the full detail of the paper was published, there was early support from within the sector for some of the proposals, though teaching unions stressed that schools were already inclusive, but children were struggling to access support because of cuts. They called for extra investment. Dr Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers’ union, agreed that many pupils are not able to access the support they need and are entitled to. “This is not due to failures on the part of school staff, who are working tirelessly to do their best for these pupils,” he said. “The government has to recognise that cuts to funding for specialist services and real-terms reductions in school budgets have contributed to long waiting lists for assessment and reduced levels of support available for pupils.” Jolanta Lasota, chief executive of Ambitious about Autism, said that while some of the proposals were welcome, others may be ringing alarm bells for parents. “Plans to strengthen accountability in the system and provide more support to help young people bridge the gap from education to employment are a positive move to improve outcomes for autistic pupils. “However, proposals to introduce a new framework for banding of higher-needs support will need to be closely examined. Autistic young people and their needs do not easily fit into a neat box or band.” Jo Hutchinson, a director at the Education Policy Institute, said: “The devil will be in the detail and, most crucially, the implementation. Families across the country will rightly only believe in better Send provision when it arrives.” The shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, added: “This paper has been delayed three times, taken nearly 1,000 days to put together, yet it still fails to deliver the transformation in support needed to change this picture.”",News/Education,Government sets out plans to overhaul special educational needs system,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/29/government-sets-out-plans-to-overhaul-special-educational-needs-system
3/29/2022,"The government’s attack on fundamental rights and protections enshrined in UK law is an “act of human rights vandalism” that would curtail the ability of people to hold the state to account, Amnesty International has claimed. In its annual report on the state of human rights across the world, Amnesty strongly criticised the British government for its attempts to dismantle the Human Rights Act and a battery of new “draconian” legislation on refugees and policing. Sacha Deshmukh, head of Amnesty International UK, said: “The UK can’t credibly champion human rights internationally if it’s busily undermining and unravelling them at home. “The Human Rights Act is the central pillar of rights and protections in the UK, and it’s vital for the big justice fights we are currently facing. “It’s the means by which we can challenge police behaviour, contest poorer health outcomes for ethnic minority groups, and ensure a proper Covid inquiry. Scrapping the Human Rights Act is an act of human rights vandalism that must be countered at all costs.” Deshmukh said the public’s recent outpouring of support for people fleeing Ukraine underlined the need for the government to reconsider its hostile treatment of asylum seekers. Amnesty’s report also strongly criticised the government’s controversial nationality and borders bill. The legislation, which is going through parliament, would deprive many refugees of the right to seek or be granted asylum in the UK, contrary to international law. It could also criminalise those attempting to claim asylum after crossing the Channel, and could see asylum seekers sent to other countries for processing, Amnesty warned. Last week, the government won a series of votes in the House of Commons to restore parts of the nationality and borders bill that had been removed after strong opposition from the House of Lords, including plans to process refugees’ claims abroad. Amnesty also described the government’s police, crime, sentencing and courts bill as a serious danger to the right to freedom of assembly and association, saying it would severely limit public protest in the UK. People’s rights would be drastically limited, with police powers to ban protests deemed too “noisy” or “disruptive” increased, said Amnesty. “The UK has set a very worrying reverse course on rights and protections just when it should be standing up for human rights, not dismantling them,” said Deshmukh. The report also highlighted the government’s decision to cut its emergency welfare response to the pandemic of an extra £20 a week for those on universal credit, which is expected to push an estimated 500,000 more people into poverty as the cost of living soars. On a global scale, the Amnesty report concludes that post-pandemic promises to “build back better” have been broken by governments across the world. “2021 should have been a year of healing and recuperation,” Agnès Callamard, secretary general of Amnesty International, said in a foreword. “Instead, it became an incubator for greater inequality and instability, not only in 2021, not just for 2022, but for the decade ahead.” Despite enough production to fully vaccinate the world in 2021, by the end of the year under 4% of those living in poor countries had been fully vaccinated. World leaders had instead colluded with corporations to hoard power and profit, leading to deepening global inequality, the report said. “While companies’ CEOs and investors bagged big profits, those desperately needing the vaccine were told to wait. And die,” said Callamard ",News/Global development,"UK’s draft refugee and police laws are ‘human rights vandalism’, says Amnesty",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/29/uks-draft-refugee-and-police-laws-are-human-rights-vandalism-says-amnesty
3/29/2022,"A Melbourne community radio station has cut ties with a volunteer Russian-language broadcaster after complaints that his program was promoting war propaganda amid the invasion of Ukraine. The program on 3ZZZ broadcast pro-Kremlin information about the war in Ukraine, including a speech by Russian president Vladimir Putin where he claimed the war was justified because of the need to “demilitarise and de-Nazify Ukraine”. The program had a one-hour slot on Wednesdays and Fridays. The Age revealed last week the country’s media watchdog was investigating the program hosted by volunteer Oleg Bydanov on 3ZZZ – Australia’s largest multilingual community ratio station – after receiving multiple complaints alleging it was broadcasting propaganda. Bydanov has been contacted for comment. On Monday, the 3ZZZ president, George Salloum, said the station had suspended the broadcaster after complaints that the material breached its codes of practice. “3ZZZ condemns all acts of war and violence,” he said on behalf of the station’s council. Salloum said the council had requested a formal response to the allegations from Bydanov and met with the volunteer to discuss the “seriousness of the matter”. He said the station had also appointed independent accredited translators to convert the content to English. The station had previously said it would take up to six weeks to investigate the matter due to the need to translate the program’s content. The station said it would continue to monitor the Russian program to ensure it complied with its codes of practice. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning During Russian’s invasion of Ukraine, 3ZZZ said it reminded all of its broadcasters about their obligations under the station’s constitution and its codes of practice. “3ZZZ promotes harmony and diversity and contributes to an inclusive, cohesive and culturally diverse Australian community, the first guiding principle under our community radio broadcasting codes of practice,” Salloum said. 3ZZZ broadcasts programs in more than 60 languages and is estimated to have about 400,000 listeners nationwide.",News/Australia news,Melbourne radio station 3ZZZ suspends Russian-language broadcaster over Ukraine war reports,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/melbourne-radio-station-3zzz-suspends-russian-language-broadcaster-over-ukraine-war-reports
3/29/2022,"Will Smith has taken to Instagram to apologise for slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars ceremony, after the comedian made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith’s alopecia. “Violence in all of its forms is poisonous and destructive,” he wrote. “My behaviour at last night’s Academy Awards was unacceptable and inexcusable.” That may go some way to repairing the relationship between the two men, but one thing is certain: it will not stop the punishing hot takes that have made social media all but unusable over the past 24 hours. The forward momentum is simply too great; too unyielding. The beast is awake, and it must be fed. Smith and Rock are celebrities, worth many, many millions of dollars between them. As is the case with most wealthy people, the things they do with and to one another are as far removed from normal human experience as the domestic affairs of the Greek gods. Will Smith lives in a 10,000 sq ft mansion in a gated community in the San Fernando Valley. It may as well have been Zeus slapping Hades up there. But given so many of us now take our moral instruction from things we see on variously sized screens, the slap heard around the world quickly became the world’s least interesting mass exercise in applied ethics and whataboutery. It was no longer just a bit of lurid celebrity gossip – it was an expression of everything good and bad in the world all at once. Within minutes, a televised act of mild violence emerged as the flashpoint for virtually every social, moral and political issue you’d care to name, and grist for the endless content mill most of human culture is now charged with powering. (Christos Tsiolkas was thinking way too conservatively about the possible social reverberations of a single slap, it turns out.) What began as an on-stage biff between two celebrities over a disrespectful gag quickly became a Thunderdome for increasingly irrelevant arguments, as millions of users experiencing the internet equivalent of a sugar high tried to cram it into whatever their pet issue was at that moment. Was Will Smith’s slap a sadly perfect example of toxic masculinity? Proof of Hollywood’s double standards on bad behaviour? A radical act of civil disobedience against ableism and misogyny? Evidence for structural racism? Evidence against structural racism? Cancel culture? A metaphor for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine? A deliberate distraction from that same invasion? Incontrovertible evidence of how the Holocaust could be allowed to happen? Brexit? Trump? 9/11? As the facts of the matter are undeniably simple, many seasoned posters saw fit to engineer a series of increasingly abstract counterfactuals to litigate their chosen point. What if one of them were a white woman? What if the joke had been about asthma instead of alopecia? What if Smith had a gun? “Just a reminder that if Will Smith had slapped Betty White for a joke she made (however insensitive), she easily could have fallen backward, cracked her skull, and died of a brain bleed,” read one instantly viral tweet, pointlessly conjuring a scenario in which the deceased actor was not only still alive but making off-colour alopecia jokes at the Academy Awards. In each post you can see an aching effort to establish some new turf on the unending torrent of online opinion, and to find some new meaningful resonance to an event that was, at the end of the day, an internationally broadcast moment of inflamed passions that had very little to do with the Russian shelling of Mariupol. I could make a broader point here about the perverse incentives of the modern internet and the resulting toxic effect on the discourse. In the early days of mass uptake of social media, some theorists turned to an academic term from the world of media studies to capture the profound social weirdness these new platforms brought with them. “Context collapse” – which refers to the dislocating experience of having infinitely diverse audiences occupying the same online spaces and consuming the same content in radically different ways – has become part of the fabric of daily life. But you know what? If I made the point then I might be no less insane than the people imagining a scenario in which Will Smith slapped Betty White to death on the Oscars stage. Instead, as a committed consumer of some of the worst posts online, I’ll just keep having the time of my life.

3/29/2022,"At the beginning of the first lockdown, I bought a hammock. It just about fits in my paved backyard between the raised beds, below the washing line. I can lie in it and look up at the sky, telephone wires chopping the blue into splinters, laundry flapping over my head. The first warm-enough day of the year, when I can finally lie back and take my swaying place among the plants again, is long-awaited. And here it is, at last. All around me are beginnings. The roses have new red fingers. Bleeding hearts raise their hands from the still-cold soil between the purple crocuses. Most gardeners would be eager to get started, but instead of greeting spring with busyness, I have made it my ritual to do the opposite. I lie still and listen first, before even thinking about work. It feels right, respectful. Here is a chance to hear the news – the world’s, the garden’s, my own. I close my eyes. The pigeon who likes to sit in the old shrub by the fence is cooing softly. I wait for the pause and the inevitable flap, flap, flap, when something startles her, and smile when I hear it. I can hear a robin, sweet as cordial, two gardens over, and the angry rattle of magpies. There is construction noise too, sudden and jarring, and traffic sounds like the sea. A buzz in my left ear tells me a bee has joined the rosemary. What does it all mean? The benefit of rest is that it gives you a chance to listen and understand. I let each sound come and go, out of my control, each thing in turn blissful or disturbing. I fall asleep, inevitably. A starling wakes me with a jolt from its usual spot on the chimney – my garden’s defiant arcade machine, shooting his whistling sparks and explosions. I laugh, relax, my heart hammering in surprise. Peace. Safety. The privilege of growth to come. There is nothing better than this, nothing more precious. Yes, that is the story here, I think.
