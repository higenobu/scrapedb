2/10/2022,"Nicki Broderick arrived promptly at 9:30 a.m. on June 13, 2011, for her first day as an employee at the video game developer Blizzard Entertainment. Lined up in front of her keyboard she found a row of shots—she thinks they were Fireball Whisky—apparently to acknowledge that it was also Broderick’s 21st birthday. She'd never done shots before, at any time of day, but downed them with her manager. It was the first time Broderick, who spent eight years at Blizzard, felt forced to drink at work. But it was far from the last. Later, during a work trip to Korea, Broderick says she was instructed not to refuse any drinks on a celebratory evening out with colleagues from a company that had partnered with Blizzard on an e-sports event, lest the vendor be offended. “They made me drink until I was blackout drunk,” Broderick tells Fortune. “I don’t even know how I got back to my hotel that night.” Broderick’s experience was extreme, but hardly unique. More than two dozen women told Fortune that for most of Blizzard's three-decade history they felt they were treated differently from men. In fact, they say, the demeaning and bullying behavior often began the moment a woman arrived. During new employee onboarding, men would walk by to, as some put it, “check out the crop”—meaning, of women. When a woman arrived for her first day of work, “there would literally be a group of men around her so you couldn’t even see her,” says a female current longtime employee. In the quality assurance department, according to multiple employees, including Broderick, for a time there was a spreadsheet to rank new hires on a ""hotness"" scale from 1 to 10—listing a woman’s best features and whether she was available or not. Some women say they quickly learned to avoid answering questions about relationship status. “Otherwise, these guys wouldn’t work with me, or wouldn’t go out of their way to help me out or get me engaged on a project,” a female former employee tells Fortune. Blizzard, the 31-year-old video game powerhouse known for World of Warcraft and Overwatch, is a division of Activision Blizzard, which ranks No. 373 on the Fortune 500. In 2008, Activision acquired Blizzard's parent company, and the video game maker became a unit of Activision. Still, Blizzard long retained its own distinctive culture—one that many former and current employees describe as toxic. The workplace issues at Blizzard have come to the fore thanks to a July 2021 suit brought by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) alleging gender discrimination, harassment, and retaliation—this after a more than two-year investigation into the company that began in 2018.The 29-page court filing and the subsequent 35-page amended complaint assert that the company “fostered a sexist culture” by paying women less than men despite instances in which employees performed substantially similar work; assigned women to lower-level jobs and promoted them at slower rates compared with men; fired or forced women to quit more frequently than men; and subjected women to ""constant sexual harassment."" As the amended complaint reads, ""Female employees almost universally confirmed that working for Defendants was akin to working in a frat house, which invariably involved male employees drinking and subjecting female employees…to sexual harassment with no repercussion."" The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission also filed suit against the company in September for sexual harassment and pregnancy discrimination. (Activision denied “all allegations of wrongdoing,” and said it had agreed to settle the DFEH suit to avoid “the expense, distraction and possible litigation associated with such a dispute”. The company also sent Fortune a list of 15 recent changes it had instituted to improve workplace conditions, including a November policy to ban alcohol in the workplace, and waiving required arbitration of individual sexual harassment and discrimination claims.) Over a period of several months, Fortune interviewed 29 current and former Blizzard employees about their experience. Taken together they paint a dark and complicated picture of how Blizzard, a vibrant and outrageously successful gaming startup that for its first three years employed not a single woman, became part of a Fortune 500 company that routinely allowed women to be harassed, belittled, and discriminated against.

2/10/2022,"Against a background of surging gasoline prices at the beginning of an election year, a group of Democratic lawmakers are calling for a suspension of the federal gas tax for the rest of 2022. The Gas Prices Relief Act proposed by Sens. Maggie Hassan (D-HN) and Mark Kelly (D-AZ) – both of whom are up for reelection in the fall – would suspend the 18.4 cents per gallon federal gas tax until the beginning of 2023. The legislation would also empower the Treasury Department to monitor retail prices of gas to ensure that producers are passing the tax savings on to consumers. And it would require the Treasury to maintain the integrity of the federal Highway Trust Fund by covering the lost gas tax revenues with general tax revenues. “People are feeling a real pinch on everyday goods, and we must do more to help address rising costs, particularly the price of gas,” Hassan said in a statement. Several Democrats – including Sens. Debbie Stabenow (MI), Catherine Cortez Masto (NV), Jacky Rosen (NV) and Raphael Warnock (GA) – have signed on as cosponsors of the bill. In the House, Rep. Josh Harder (D-CA) expressed support for the legislation. The nationwide price of a gallon of gas is now $3.45, about a dollar more than it was a year ago, according to AAA. A recovering economy and the threat of war in Ukraine are expected to keep upward pressure on gas prices, at least in the near term. Like what you're reading?

2/10/2022,"U.S. stock futures declined in pre-market trading Thursday as Wall Street weighed another decades-high inflation print. Futures tied to the Nasdaq fell 206 points, or 1.37% following a fresh read on the CPI Index that reflected a 7.5% annual gain in January, the fastest rise since 1982. Contracts on the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also fell lower. In the previous session, Wall Street’s main benchmarks were lifted by an influx of strong corporate earnings.The Walt Disney Company (DIS), a component of the Dow, unveiled first quarter 2022 results after the bell on Wednesday that sharply beat estimates. Better than expected growth for the entertainment giant’s streaming service Disney+ and a recovery in theme park attendance sent shares up as much as 9% after the report. Uber (UBER) also posted results after market close, revealing quarterly revenue that topped analyst forecasts and indicated headwinds caused by the Omicron COVID surge have eased. In Wednesday’s main session, Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) was in the spotlight when shares popped after the fast-casual restaurant chain posted a quarterly earnings beat and saw margins expand, despite concerns over food price inflation and labor costs. “Last year, it was all about ‘tell me the story and how great it is,’ while this year, it’s ‘show me the money and show me that you’re growing profitably — that you have cash flow,’” Satori Fund founder and portfolio manager Dan Niles told Yahoo Finance Live. After a surprise shift by the Federal Reserve on how aggressively it would tighten monetary conditions rocked equities in January, investors have found relief in strong earnings over recent weeks. Bank of America said in its latest update that S&P 500 earnings per share (EPS) are exceeding consensus expectations by 6% so far for the latest quarter and tracking toward a growth rate of well over 20% on a year-over-year basis. But as earnings season winds down, investors will turn their attention to macroeconomic concerns. On Thursday, sights will be set on the January Consumer Price Index (CPI), expected to show a fresh 39-year high rate of inflation. “We do think the focus shifts back to the macro side of the ledger this week,” Stuart Kaiser, UBS head of equity derivatives research, told Yahoo Finance Live on Tuesday, adding the European Central Bank and Bank of England are tightening monetary policy along with the Fed and a series of high inflation prints are expected in coming months. “When we put that all together, we don’t think the bumpy ride is over.” The benchmark 10-year yield eased back from its highest level since November 2019 on Wednesday to 1.92% after ticking up to 1.96%. “Even though we see the yield curve start flattening, we are watching the 10-year very closely and the CPI number tomorrow,"" ERShares chief operating officer and chief investment strategist Eva Ados told Yahoo Finance Live, adding the three factors to monitor in the data are costs associated with labor, food prices, and energy. “The 10-year is approaching 2%,” Ados said. “Once that happens, that will trigger a psychological level and more anxiety in markets.” — Here's how stock futures fared as investors mulled the latest CPI report S&P 500 futures (ES=F): -37.75 points (-0.82%), to 4,540.00 Dow futures (YM=F): -139 points (-0.39%), to 35,502.00 Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): -192.00 points (-0.28%) to 14,846.25 — U.S. inflation accelerated in January, with prices across a wide range of goods and services soaring further amid lingering shortages and supply chain disruptions. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics Thursday morning registered a 7.5% annual gain in January. Consensus economists were looking for a 7.3% rise, according to Bloomberg data. This represented the fastest rise since 1982, as well as an acceleration from the 7.0% year-over-year increase seen in December. Energy prices remained a key contributor to the overall CPI and were up by 27% on a year-over-year basis in January. Within energy, fuel oil prices jumped 9.5% on a monthly basis, tracking the rise in crude oil prices, which rallied to a seven-year high at the beginning of the year. Electricity prices also jumped by a pronounced 4.2% on a month-over-month basis. — First-time unemployment filings came in lower in the latest weekly data, continuing a recent downward trend in jobless claims as Omicron-related pressures on the labor market begin to abate. Another 223,000 Americans filed new claims for the week ended Feb. 5, below expectations of 230,000. Filings for unemployment insurance have fallen consistently in recent weeks after a temporary surge in mid-January to a print of nearly 300,000, the highest level since October. The rush of U.S. workers applying for benefits was attributed to disruptions from the Omicron variant of COVID-19 and adjusted workforces following the seasonal hiring increase at the end of 2021. — Here were the main moves in futures trading ahead of Thursday's open S&P 500 futures (ES=F): -72.50 points (-0.16%), to 4,570.50 Dow futures (YM=F): +32.00 points (+0.09%), to 35,673.00 Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): -43.75 points (-0.29%) to 14,994.50 Crude (CL=F): +$0.96 (+1.07%) to $90.62 a barrel Gold (GC=F): -$3.00 (-0.16%) to $1,833.60 per ounce 10-year Treasury (^TNX): -0.00 bps to yield 1.9290% — Here's how the key indexes fared in post-market trading Wednesday: S&P 500 futures (ES=F): +4.00 points (+0.09%), to 4,581.75 Dow futures (YM=F): +78.00 points (+0.22%), to 35,719.00 Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): +15.50 points (+0.10%) to 15,038.25 Crude (CL=F): +$0.31 (+0.35%) to $89.97 a barrel Gold (GC=F): +$2.60 (+0.14%) to $1,833.60 per ounce 10-year Treasury (^TNX): -2.5 bps to yield 1.9290% — Alexandra Semenova is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
