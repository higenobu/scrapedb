3/11/2022,"Former President Donald Trump somehow turned a question about the Ukraine crisis into an opportunity to bemoan windmills during an appearance on the “Full Send” podcast hosted by YouTubers. “What do you see happening next, then? Cause it seems like the tensions are high. How does this all end? Is this going to be a long-term thing? How do you see it unfolding?” Nelk Boys founder Kyle Forgeard asked the former president during a sit-down discussion about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Well, and I said this a long time ago, if this happens, we are playing right into their hands. Green energy. The windmills don’t work. They’re too expensive. They kill all the birds. They ruin your landscapes,” Trump answered. “And yet the environmentalists love the windmills. And I’ve been preaching this for years. The windmills ― and I had them way down ― but the windmills are the most expensive energy you can have. And they don’t work.” Trump has a long-documented hatred of wind turbines, ever since a protracted and failed legal fight to stop Scottish officials from building what he called a “really ugly wind farm” in view of his Aberdeen golf resort. He routinely spouts bizarre lies about windmills, including the widely-mocked claim that the noise they make causes cancer. He continued to discuss windmills for some time before telling an anecdote about giving a “white flag” as a gift to former German Chancellor Angela Merkel over discussions about Nord Stream 2, a controversial natural gas pipeline between Russia and Germany. Both the U.S. and U.K. are banning oil imports from Russia to punish the Kremlin for its war on Ukraine, causing a spike in already-high gas prices for Americans. It seems Trump was citing a theory in right-wing circles that the crisis in Ukraine was a ploy to push alternative energy, as rising gas prices could force the adaption of cleaner energy such as wind turbines. Last month, for example, Fox News’ Tucker Carlson suggested that the Biden administration was provoking conflict with Russia to make a play against fossil fuels and push for renewable energy.

3/11/2022,"Russian forces continue to make inroads in southern Ukraine, but few military experts seem to think the war is going very well for Russia. The invading army has suffered ""very, very significant casualties,"" a U.S. official told CBS News on Wednesday, putting the U.S. estimate at between 5,000 and 6,000 Russian troops killed in action. That's comparable to losses in World War II battles, the U.S. official said. It's also, as Fox News' Jacqui Heinrich notes, ""more than the number of Americans killed during the Iraq War."" The U.S. estimate is about halfway between the 500 Russian casualties Moscow claims and the 12,000 Russian deaths claimed by Ukraine. The U.S. intelligence estimate also puts Ukraine's casualties at 2,000 to 4,000 killed troops plus hundreds or thousands of slain civilians. Ukrainian forces continue to destroy a stalled 40-mile-long Russian military convoy north of Kyiv, and the ""unexpected effectiveness"" of Ukraine's air defenses has curtailed Russian air activity, Britain's Ministry of Defense said early Thursday, in its latest public intelligence assessment. And as Russian casualties mount, including among conscripted troops, Russian President Vladimir Putin ""will be forced to draw from across the Russian Armed Forces and other sources to replace his losses."" Putin planned his ""disastrous"" Ukraine war ""in high secrecy in order to avoid leaks,"" and his risk-reward analysis was skewed by a lack contingency planning from his tiny circle of generals, misplaced optimism in Russia's sanctions-proofing, and the surprisingly ""deplorable state of Russian expertise on Ukraine,"" Russia expert Alexander Gabuev at the Carnegie Moscow Center tweeted Wednesday. The result is ""a tragedy for Ukraine, and a catastrophe for Russia."" ""Putin truly believed people would greet (Russians) with flowers. Instead, they were met with Molotov cocktails,"" Ukrainian diplomat Volodomyr Shalkivskyi said at Australia's National Press Club on Thursday. ""Russian soldiers going into Ukraine did not have extra ammo or food in their packs. They did however have a parade uniform for a Russian victory parade through Kyiv,"" he added. ""You cannot win a war against a free people determined to fight for their freedom. There is no way we will give up.""

3/11/2022,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow for talks on ending the war in Ukraine, political news website Politico reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. The visit comes after talks in Istanbul with a Ukrainian politician who is a member of the country's delegation for peace talks with Russia, the sources told Politico. Schroeder, German chancellor from 1998 to 2005, has been under the microscope over his links to Russian companies. He is on the board of Russian oil giant Rosneft and is chairman of the shareholders' committee of the company that is in charge of building the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and which is being sanctioned by the United States. He has faced calls from some German government politicians to step down from such roles as the other former leaders announced they were leaving positions on the boards of Russian companies over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

3/11/2022,"When Russia put out a long list of “unfriendly countries,” singling out those that have punished it for invading Ukraine, the regime didn’t include any Latin American states. Latin American countries should be ashamed. The list, released on March 7, mentioned the United States, the 27 countries of the European Union, Britain, Japan, Canada, Norway, Singapore, South Korea and Switzerland. I can’t help but wonder whether Latin America’s response to the invasion of Ukraine was so weak that Russia’s autocrat Vladimir Putin considers countries in the region to still be friendly. To be fair, most Latin American countries joined the overwhelming 141 majority vote that condemned Russia’s invasion at a United Nations General Assembly on March 1. Cuba, Nicaragua, Bolivia, El Salvador and Nicaragua abstained, and Venezuela didn’t vote. But the leaders of Brazil, Mexico, Argentina have made wishy-washy statements that seem to contradict their countries’ votes at the United Nations. Worse, virtually all Latin American countries have bucked the democratic world’s massive offensive to impose sanctions on Russia for the worst aggression against a sovereign and democratic European state in recent memory. While the United States, the European Union — and even formerly neutral countries Switzerland and Sweden — not only are imposing economic sanctions, but also sending arms to Ukraine, most Latin American presidents are not even willing to impose symbolic sanctions against the Putin regime. Most, like Mexico, have invoked their countries’ laws that supposedly prohibit them from imposing unilateral sanctions on other countries without a U.N. mandate. But in virtually all cases, that’s a misleading argument. Mexico’s President Andrés Manuel López Obrador claims that Mexico is a “pacifist” country and will not impose sanctions on any other. Mexican officials say that their country has never imposed unilateral sanctions against any country without a U.N. resolution. But that’s not true. In World War II, Mexico sent one of its elite air force squadrons to fight alongside U.S. and allied forces in the Philippines. In 1968, Mexico unilaterally banned apartheid South Africa from the Mexico City Olympics. In 1975, Mexico denied visas to South African tennis players who were headed to Mexico for a Davis Cup match. “Mexico has imposed unilateral sanctions at other times in the past, based on U.N. General Assembly resolutions,” says Jorge Lomónaco, a former Mexican ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva and to the Organization of American States. “It could perfectly well do the same now, based on the March 1 U.N. General Assembly resolution.” It would be unrealistic to demand at this time that Mexico or any other Latin American country send troops or weapons to Ukraine. And, considering Latin America’s post-pandemic economic crisis, countries in the region could be excused for not imposing economic sanctions, even when Russia is a relatively minor trading partner for most of them. In Mexico’s case, it’s the country’s 36th export market. But, at a defining moment in world history, when the future of national sovereignty, democracy and fundamental rights is at stake like never before since World War II, Latin American countries should at least take symbolic steps to make it perfectly clear to Russia whose side they’re on. Symbolic sanctions are no minor issue. Most Russians, who are fed only Putin’s propaganda through state-controlled media, still believe that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was a “defensive” military operation against a foreign threat. And Putin’s list of “unfriendly” nations leads Russians to believe that most of the world — China and India, and Latin America and African countries — are on Putin’s side. Latin American leaders should send humanitarian aid to Ukrainian refugees with urgency and suspend all sports events with Russia, following the lead of FIFA World Soccer Federation, the International Tennis Federation and other major sports organizations, which have already done this. And they should vote at the Organization of American States, as a region, to stop all cultural-exchange agreements with Russia. They should announce all of these measures, loud and clear, to send a strong message to the Russian people that Putin has committed an atrocity. It’s time for Latin America to actively side with the world’s biggest democracies — and proudly take their place on Putin’s list of “unfriendly” nations.
