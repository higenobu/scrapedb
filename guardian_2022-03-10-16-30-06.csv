3/10/2022,"The short story is seen as either a natural form, close to conversation, or an art like poetry, requiring great skill and restraint. But some poems are huge and some short stories are restless, just about contained. Some stories push at their own edges, trying to escape themselves. In The Ways, the second story in Colin Barrett’s superb second collection, every sentence is as full and alive as a sentence can be, while managing to stay ordinary. A landline “mewls”, waking a girl from the “cosy rut” of her bed. As she comes downstairs, “she swatted each light switch as she passed, in order to feel less alone”. Every chosen word catches and enlarges the character of Pell, one of three siblings who try to nurture each other after the death of their parents. Pell is similar to the characters in Barrett’s first collection Young Skins, which concerned itself with the disenfranchised, the peripheral, the damaged and the lost, and won the Guardian first book award in 2014. This collection extends Barrett’s range, but it has its share of damage, still. Two men are in wheelchairs; one character’s hands are stuck in a rictus that obliges him to drink from a straw. A stranger is “touched”, as people were said to be touched by the fairy folk; another man is, in a more modern way, in and out of a mental hospital. In some stories, the folkloric gives way to the contemporary right there on the page: an old-style bachelor is described as an “incel”, a herd of slightly mythic cattle is overseen by the owner’s drone. One of the stories is set in Toronto, where Barrett has been based for some years, but as the title Homesickness may indicate, most are set in a version of the place where he grew up, County Mayo on the west coast of Ireland. (There is, perhaps, some added snow.) The characters live in small towns, they meet and sometimes fight in pubs, they drive bad cars: a Vectra, a Mondeo, a Hitachi Hiace “with piebald panelling”. These can be engines of death and injury – one is the site of suicide – but they also offer temporary freedom and are traded and prized. In its highest style, the work fits into a tradition that moves through Kevin Barry and Marina Carr back to the epic tales of old Ireland, a mode that shifted from the heroic into the mock-heroic in the work of Joyce and Flann O’Brien. Three brothers called the Alps, in the story of that name, are “shortish men with massive arses and brutally capable forearms”. A little bit grandiose, a little bit disgusting, their dialogue is rich, comical and full of grace notes. “How’s the form?” asks one. “The form remains legendary,” says the barman, and he might be referring to the story at hand. In The Ways, however, this richness of texture makes for a style that is full and compressed, the way anger feels compressed. Pell’s younger brother has been in a scrap at school, and her older brother Nick remembers the feeling after a fight: “the rinsed muscles, the warm quiver of shot nerves”. Sorting the problem calls Nick away from his work in a hotel kitchen. Afterwards: “There had been a minute left of his smoke break and, with the sensation of tears boiling behind his eyes, he smoked that minute out.” Nothing large happens, apart from impossibility and decline. Suspended from school, Gerry plays a Nintendo game and is bored by the need to keep shooting things “in order to advance the plot”. What he loves is roaming the gorgeous game map. “You could, of course, shoot every living thing in the game, though Gerry refrained wherever possible.” I don’t think it is too strong to say that Barrett’s work hit an inflection point in Irish culture. His first collection was published just two years before Ireland’s Waking the Feminists movement called out a seemingly unshiftable bias against women’s voices in the creative arts. It was a remarkable four years before the Repeal the Eighth campaign, which saw men of Barrett’s generation do feminist work to ensure abortion services to women within Ireland. To be a male writer in those years must have required a kind of double vision, a tally of what might be lost and what could be gained. This is more problematic in a tradition so interested in loss, and how men in particular deal with the hurt of dispossession. A real writer (no small compliment, here) meets all this. He lets the changing moment sink in and settle, and inform what comes next. Pell is not the only woman in Homesickness who is properly and profoundly observed. Three other stories deal with the limits, the sweetness and the difficulty of female compassion. Eileen, who looks out for her friend Murt, who picks him up after a stay in hospital, who walks with him and tries to stabilise his day, is told to back off by his brother. “You have to take your boot off his throat”, he says, and many women readers will recognise the bewildering unfairness there, how Eileen’s body felt “like a heavy coat she had neglected to remove”. It is also typical of Barrett, that the brother may have a point. A couple of stories are about writers, and all of them are, in some way, about writing, about the necessity and foolishness of one or another style as we circle what cannot be said. In each of Barrett’s styles, however, there is an utterness to his attention, a devotion to the lives of his characters, that shifts the work into some more lasting place. Barrett is already one of the leading writers of the Irish short story, which is to braggingly say, one of the leading writers of the short story anywhere. He means every word and regrets every word. He just kills it. The Silver Coast, which is the most open, glancing and underplotted piece in the collection, is about four women talking after a funeral. “The world is full of unaccountable things, if you’re keeping track,” says one. “And who keeps track?” her daughter replies.

3/10/2022,"Australian virologists have uncovered a drug-resistant mutation in the Covid-19 virus associated with the drug sotrovimab and say without the monitoring of patients given the treatment the mutated virus could spread in the community. The world-first findings, published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday, are the result of an analysis of the first 100 patients in western Sydney during the Delta outbreak in 2021 to be given sotrovimab. Sotrovimab is a monoclonal antibody that is available in many countries to treat vulnerable patients who are at risk of severe disease and death due to Covid-19 infection. Sotrovimab must be administered via infusion within the first five days of Covid-19 infection, and prevents Covid-19 symptoms from becoming severe. It is one of the few human-engineered monoclonal antibodies that can target Omicron. The lead author of the study, Dr Rebecca Rockett, said four of the patients developed resistance to sotrovimab six to 13 days after treatment. The whole genome sequence of the virus analysed from the patients before and after sotrovimab treatment uncovered mutations in a few patients that “made the drug effectively inactive,” Rockett, from the University of Sydney’s Institute for Infectious Diseases, said. “We’re not sure if sotrovimab helps neutralise the virus early on in the infection before it develops resistance. But often drugs are given to treat Covid-19 patients and there’s not really any follow-up done. We realise that you can’t follow every patient with PCR testing or genomic surveillance, but we are trying to advocate for patients that progress to severe disease despite the treatment that we investigate using genomics to see whether they’ve acquired any resistance mutations.” It was important to monitor them because once the patients acquired the mutations, Rockett and her team could still take samples from them and grow the virus in the laboratory, which meant they were still infectious. It meant the patients were at risk of passing the mutated virus on to others. “What we don’t want to see is resistant virus disseminating in the community, because that will mean that a lot of other people can’t use this drug as well.” Rockett said it would be prudent for those who developed resistance to isolate for longer until the virus had cleared, and make extra efforts to remain separate from those in the same household. The virus persisted in the affected patients for up to 24 days after sotrovimab treatment.

An infectious diseases physician and drug resistance expert with the Australian National University, Prof Peter Collignon, said potential spread of resistant viruses in the community presented “a real problem”. “Thankfully, this mutation appears to be a relatively rare event, but the only way you ever know that is to keep an eye on it.”",News/World news,"Covid treatment sotrovimab can cause drug-resistant mutation, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/covid-treatment-sotrovimab-can-cause-drug-resistant-mutation-study-finds
3/10/2022,"The head of Ukraine’s embassy in Australia says he cannot remain “diplomatically polite” when his parents spend their nights in a bomb shelter in Kyiv, and has called for the Russian ambassador to be expelled. Volodymyr Shalkivskyi issued the plea to the Australian government as he spoke about how his parents, aged in their 70s, had rebuffed suggestions to flee Ukraine’s capital and were now asking for molotov cocktail recipes. “They’re making sandwiches [for] our military and they spend the nights in bomb shelters,” Shalkivskyi, the chargé d’affaires at Ukraine’s embassy in Australia, said on Thursday. “As my father told me, two nights in a bomb shelter is enough to completely change any pro-Russian sentiment that you have in your heart.” Shalkivskyi also relayed a message he had received from his mother, 73, after she looked out from the balcony on the seventh floor of her apartment building in northern Kyiv. “‘I think it’s a good position. Can you send me a recipe of molotov cocktail?’” The Australian government has ratcheted up sanctions against Russian political, military and business figures over the invasion of Ukraine, but has stopped short of expelling Russian diplomats at this stage saying it wants to keep open lines of communication. Shalkivskyi told the National Press Club in Canberra countries including Australia needed to “use all means that we have in our disposal in order to fight back”. He said while in his line of work he usually stuck with “diplomatic narratives”, children had died in shelling. “I am not in the position to be diplomatically polite. Having my parents in bomb shelters, it makes you kind of more decisive,” Shalkivskyi said. “Yes, I’d like Russian ambassador to be expelled. I’d like to have a boycott of all Russian supply routes and services in Australia. I’d like to stop any shipping companies to enter territorial waters. I’d like Australia to join the fight in countering Russian propaganda.” The comments came after Ukrainian authorities said Russian bombs had “completely destroyed” a hospital in Mariupol. Local authorities said at least 17 people had been wounded in the shelling of the complex, which has children’s and maternity wards. In January, the Russian ambassador to Australia, Alexey Pavlovsky, gave a lengthy press conference in Canberra in which he denied the buildup of Russian troops near the border with Ukraine was a sign of aggression. Since then, the Russian embassy in Canberra has repeated the line that Russia is engaged in a military operation to “demilitarise” Ukraine. Shalkivskyi said Putin had made a number of miscalculations, including whether the west was divided and how quickly Russian forces could capture Kyiv. He said Ukraine was engaging in dialogue with Russia, but would not surrender its freedom. “We belong to the European family and there is no way we will give up,” he said. Shalkivskyi said he had received calls from Australians seeking to join Ukraine’s foreign legion of volunteers to fight against Russian forces, but he did not know how many had actually travelled to the country. The Australian government has cautioned citizens against travelling to Ukraine to fight on either side, saying it would be dangerous and legally ambiguous. Under the Criminal Code, it is an offence for an Australian to enter a foreign country to engage in hostile activity, unless it is done as part of “the person’s service in any capacity in or with the armed forces of the government of a foreign country”. That means whether such travel is legal hinges on whether international volunteers will actually be considered full members of Ukraine’s armed forces. Pressed on that point, Shalkivskyi said he did not have “a lot of information because it’s just started” but believed the foreign legion was “part of our defence force”. While he confirmed the embassy would “facilitate” people who wanted to travel to join the legion, such as by supplying contact details, Shalkivskyi also urged them to check Australia’s laws and make their own “adult choice”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “I always stress that we do not want you guys to get in trouble on your way back home, so please check the legislation,” he said. Shalkivskyi said he understood that the first shipment of supplies that left Australia bound for Ukraine last week was “non-lethal equipment”. Defence said on Thursday a second RAAF C-17A Globemaster flight had now delivered “defensive military assistance” to the Ukrainian government. The Australian government has pledged $70m in lethal military aid and Shalkivskyi said he understood that aspect would largely be coordinated by Nato. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said Russia had “trampled fundamental principles” and “inflicted terrible injury and death on civilians”. Addressing the Lowy Institute on Thursday, Albanese said Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, had “shown incredible courage and leadership in extraordinarily difficult circumstances”. But Albanese said there were “many reasons to be concerned” about the “no limits” partnership that Russia and China formalised just weeks before the invasion of Ukraine, in light of Beijing’s “growing assertiveness in our region”. The defence minister, Peter Dutton, said on Thursday it would be wrong to assume Putin’s “only ambition” was to take Ukraine, or that Xi Jinping’s ambitions were “restricted just to Taiwan”. Dutton said Australia must therefore “provide a deterrence effect” and work closely with its allies. With the election looming, the Australian government announced plans for a major expansion of the Australian defence force over the coming two decades.",News/Australia news,‘My parents are in bomb shelters’: Ukrainian embassy head urges Australia to expel Russian ambassador,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/10/my-parents-are-in-bomb-shelters-ukrainian-embassy-head-urges-australia-to-expel-russian-ambassador
3/10/2022,"Interrupting the certification of Joe Biden’s election win on 6 January last year as part of the scheme to return Donald Trump to office was known to be unlawful by at least one of the former president’s lawyers, according to an email exchange about the potential conspiracy. The former Trump lawyer John Eastman – who helped coordinate the scheme from the Trump “war room” at the Willard hotel in Washington – conceded in an email to counsel for then vice-president Mike Pence, Greg Jacob, that the plan was a violation of the Electoral Count Act. But Eastman then urged Pence to move ahead with the scheme anyway, pressuring the former vice-president’s counsel to consider supporting the effort on the basis that it was only a “minor violation” of the statute that governed the certification procedure. The admission that the scheme was unlawful undercuts arguments by Eastman and the Willard war room team that they believed there was no wrongdoing in seeking to have Pence delay the certification past 6 January – one of the strategies they sought to return Trump to power. It additionally raises the prospect that the other members of the Willard war room – including Trump’s former attorney Rudy Giuliani and Trump’s former strategist Steve Bannon – were also aware that the scheme to delay or stop the certification was unlawful from the start. The request to adjourn the joint session was one of several strategies Eastman had laid out in an infamous memo presented to Trump, Pence and top aides last year that outlined how the former vice-president could attempt to unilaterally overturn the 2020 election results. The strategy to delay the joint session past 6 January was about buying time for Trump and his team to pressure state legislatures to send Trump slates of electors to Congress on the basis that the Biden slates were illegitimate because of supposed election fraud. The email exchange – revealed in court filings by the select committee last week – shows Eastman attempted to take advantage of the fact that the Electoral Count Act was not followed exactly in the immediate aftermath of the Capitol attack to try and benefit Trump. “The Senate and House have both violated the Electoral Count Act this evening – they debated the Arizona objections for more than two hours. Violation of 3 USC 17,” Eastman wrote to Jacob in his 9.44pm email, referring to the statute in the US criminal code. But in the second part of his email, Eastman claimed that because the statute had already been violated in small ways – delays that amounted to a few hours at best – Pence should have no problem committing “one more minor violation and adjourn for 10 days”. That admission is significant since it demonstrates Eastman knew the scheme to delay Biden’s certification was unlawful – which the select committee believes bolsters its case that he was involved in a conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruct Congress. The House counsel, Douglas Letter, appearing on behalf of the select committee in federal court on Tuesday, referenced the admission as he postulated that Eastman knew what he was advocating violated both the Electoral Count Act statute and the constitution. Letter also said of Eastman’s request of Pence: “It was so minor it could have changed the entire course of our democracy. It could have meant the popularly elected president could have been thwarted from taking office. That was what Dr Eastman was urging.” But if Eastman knew the scheme violated the law, it raises the additional possibility that Giuliani also knew it was unlawful when he called the Republican senator Tommy Tuberville and asked him to object to Biden’s wins, after the Capitol attack had taken place. In a voicemail recorded at about 7pm that evening, and published by the Dispatch, Giuliani implored Tuberville to object to 10 states Biden won once Congress reconvened at 8pm, a process that would have concluded 15 hours later and dragged the joint session into the next day.“The only strategy we can follow is to object to numerous states and raise issues so that we get ourselves into tomorrow – ideally until the end of tomorrow,” Giuliani said. The admission from Eastman came as part of a thread of emails with Jacob in filings submitted by the select committee seeking to challenge Eastman’s claim that more than a hundred emails demanded by the panel are protected by attorney-client privilege and should remain secret. But the select committee said in the filings that it should be allowed to conduct an in camera review of the records to determine whether the crime-fraud exception applied, arguing in part they appeared to show Eastman was engaged in criminal conspiracy and common law fraud. The judge in the case ruled in the panel’s favor after the hearing on Tuesday, allowing a review of around a hundred emails to determine whether the records were subject to privilege, though he did not comment on whether Eastman might have engaged in criminal activity.",News/US news,"Trump lawyer knew plan to delay Biden certification was unlawful, emails show",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/10/trump-lawyer-plan-john-eastman-mike-pence
3/10/2022,"My parents separated two years ago after 35 years of marriage. They share a Lloyds Gold account and my dad, who is a severe alcoholic, has raised their joint overdraft to almost £1,000. Mum been attempting since August to downgrade the account to a “Classic”, so it doesn’t incur a £15 a month fee, but Lloyds is proving incredibly unhelpful. It has only agreed to freeze the account, which is “temporary”, and they’ve dissuaded her from paying off the overdraft. She’s now stuck with an account she can’t close or use. Lloyds’s only suggestion was that my dad sign a form agreeing to close the account, but he hasn’t responded. The financial ombudsman acknowledged that Lloyds has handled it poorly, and ordered it to reduce the overdraft debt and contribute £30 for two monthly payments. But she’s still stuck with the account and the fees, and the prospect of Dad again raising the overdraft if, and when, it is unfrozen. With the divorce likely to take another 16 months, this just seems an opportunity for Lloyds to earn an extra £240 at my mum’s expense.Name withheld This is a heart-rending case and Lloyds admits that it should have acted more swiftly. The bank says that when it is made aware of a dispute between joint account holders, it cancels future payments and restricts access so that both parties have to co-sign before any changes can be made. Your father would therefore have had to authorise the repayment of the overdraft and the downgrading of the account. That only works if both account holders are fully functioning, and you say your mother had repeatedly explained her circumstances. Only after my contact did Lloyds refer the case to a specialist team, which lifted the block to allow her to settle the overdraft and remove her name from the account. It’s paid £250 in goodwill, on top of an earlier payment of £100 for giving incorrect advice, and has refunded all the fees incurred while the account has been in dispute.

3/10/2022,"It has surprise: an old pair of long johns caught in the propeller. It has tension: will the narrowboat be successfully reversed to its last turning point? It has excitement: a 40-minute descent on the steepest set of lock gates in the UK. None of those are the mega-thrills provided by many TV shows today, but that’s the point. Who needs them? Sometimes low jeopardy is as thrilling as high. “It is all about escapism really,” says Robbie Cumming, the ever-cheerful storyteller in BBC Four’s Canal Boat Diaries which is about to return for a third series. “What people tell me is that the series really relaxed them, that it helped them through lockdown.” The new series sees Cumming on his boat, Naughty Lass, travelling on 170 miles of canals and waterways from Wigan to Ripon. Cumming was already something of a canal boat star before his BBC series thanks to his YouTube channel, but now he is approaching canal boat superstar status. The programme has been credited with encouraging people to spend more time on Britain’s canals. According to the Canal and River Trust there are more boats on canals now than at the height of the Industrial Revolution. “I do get recognised more and more each year and that’s great,” he says. “I was in Ikea and someone saw me and said, ‘What are you doing in here?’ I had to tell them that I’m not always on a canal.” He came late to boats, having grown up in the countryside of north Dorset, where most of the residents were retired. “Nothing ever happened,” he recalled. “A stream ran past our house and I always used to go on at my dad about doing something with it … even then I was obsessed with living by water.” He moved to London and in his early 30s, and struggling to afford to live anywhere, Cumming accepted a friend’s offer to keep a narrowboat running over winter. He was hooked. He knew immediately it was how he wanted to live. The question soon became how do you make it a job as well as a life? But he has, and is living the dream. “There is a joy in stripping everything back to the bare essentials, getting rid of stuff you don’t really need,” he says. “I haven’t got a microwave. I haven’t got a dishwasher. I haven’t even got a washing machine. But I do enjoy the challenge of fending for myself, of not paying people to do things. “It’s a lifestyle. It’s being close to nature. It’s about having that constant change of scenery … it’s the variety of life it gives me. I like exploring, and I like to be as far off the beaten track as possible, even if I get lost.” The series, made using small cameras and footage from Cumming’s mobile phone, follows him along the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, the Grade I-listed Bingley Five Rise Locks in West Yorkshire, the Aire and Calder Navigation, the Selby Canal and up the tidal River Ouse to York before ending in Ripon. The Bingley locks, considered one of the wonders of Britain’s waterways, drop more than 18 metres and are the steepest flight of locks in Britain. “It’s not until you look back that you think, oh, it is quite a drop,” says Cumming. The episodes see him finding beauty in unexpected places, such as the derelict and atmospheric Cowling Mill in Chorley. “I love dilapidated buildings. They are quite sad, especially when there’s nothing happening with them, but impressive to look at nonetheless.” Cumming’s favourite spot on his journey was always where he was at that moment. When he spoke to the Guardian he was on the Calder and Hebble Navigation between Sowerby Bridge and Wakefield. “I am absolutely loving it. It is quite industrial, quite wild, and there are only certain places you can stop. But the local people make it – and being able to see the changing landscapes as you make your way around. I can find something magical everywhere I go.” Getting lost is one of the pleasingly low-jeopardy incidents in the new series, when Cumming steers his boat down a disused arm of a canal in Skipton. “I felt like I was exploring it for the first time, even though many, many boats had been there before me in the past.” Another tense moment comes when Cummings volunteers to reverse the narrowboat of some “hire-boaters” who had gone past a turning point and didn’t fancy another six locks – and six back – before they could turn again. Would he make it? Would he avoid other boats in what can be a tricky manoeuvre? Needless to say, all was fine. Cummings cheerfully admits that his mechanical knowledge is limited, and that when he does have a problem it is often something wrapped around the propeller. One time it was the boat’s own rope. “It is one of the most basic things you’re told as you set off. People say, ‘Watch out for those ropes: don’t let them drop in the water and wrap around your propeller’.” None of what happens in the series is scripted or planned, he adds. “It is as we find it. From experience, if you try to organise anything on a canal, it never works out. “We are travelling at 4mph don’t forget.”  Canal Boat Diaries is on BBC Four from 14 March",Lifestyle/Travel,Thrills and spills at 4mph: the return of Canal Boat Diaries,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/mar/10/return-of-canal-boat-diaries-robbie-cumming
3/10/2022,"Oil and gas companies are facing a potential bonanza from the Ukraine war, though few in the industry want to admit it, and many are using soaring prices and the fear of fuel shortages to cement their position with governments in ways that could have disastrous impacts on the climate crisis. “There is a huge opportunity for oil and gas companies, though I’m sure it is not one they would have chosen,” said Robert Buckley, head of relationship development at Cornwall Insight, an energy analysis company. “They have the opportunity to reposition themselves [as crucial to policymakers]. There is going to be a very high price for oil for a very long time, and even the prospect of physical shortages.” Oil prices have leapt dramatically, to more than $130 a barrel, sending petrol prices in the UK to more than 155p a litre, while gas prices have also surged. Luke Sussams, of Jefferies investment bank, said: “The high-price environment is likely to last a long time. Boris Johnson has said that alongside the accelerated deployment of renewables will be greater production from the North Sea. There is the potential for growth prospects and upside [for fossil fuel producers].” The EU, the UK and the US have all announced drastic restrictions on imports of oil and gas from Russia, which will affect the EU most as about 40% of EU gas comes from Russia, but will hurt all countries as prices are set internationally. Those governments are now urgently seeking ways to protect their energy security, through ramping up renewables and seeking alternative sources of oil and gas supply. Opec, and Saudi Arabia in particular, are the obvious ports of call, but have been so far been reluctant to commit to increased production. This could change, as the FT reported that the United Arab Emirates’ ambassador to the US favoured an increase, news which sent oil prices down about 11% from their peak. But the crisis gives western oil and gas companies such as BP, Shell, Exxon and Total leverage among governments. In the UK, prime minister Boris Johnson defended oil companies against calls for a windfall tax on Wednesday from Labour. He said: “The net result of that would be to simply see the oil companies put their prices up yet higher and make it more difficult for them to do what we need them to do … divesting from dependence on Russian oil and gas.” Robin Baillie, partner in the energy group at the international law firm Crowell and Moring, said: “Governments around the world are looking for short-term solutions to finding an alternative to Russian energy, and the North Sea is an obvious one for the UK, until such time as more renewables come online.” New oil and gas fields take years and even decades to come into production, so even if companies begin to expand their exploration immediately it will not reduce current prices. Big oil and gas companies are now awash with cash, which they could use to invest in pumping more from existing fields, and exploring new fields. Green campaigners warned that oil and gas companies were using the Ukraine emergency to further their own interests, by encouraging governments to prioritise oil and gas production and make decisions now on investments that would have little impact on the current crisis but would vastly increase fossil fuel use for years to come. Marc van Baal, of Follow This, a group of 8,000 green shareholders in oil and gas companies, said: “The leaders of oil and gas companies really have shown in the last years that they want to hold on to their old business model. This is what they understand – turning hydrocarbons into petro-dollars. So I am afraid this is what they are telling governments they should do.” Tessa Khan, director of Uplift, which campaigns to end North Sea fossil fuels, said: “It’s shameful that oil and gas companies, some of whom have profited from their Russian partnerships for years, now seek to use this humanitarian crisis to further their interests. The fact that they are still being listened to by governments, the UK’s included, is beyond belief.” A stark reminder of the likely consequences of further dependence on oil and gas came from the International Energy Agency, which reported on Tuesday that greenhouse gas emissions had shown the highest ever annual increase in 2021. The global energy watchdog found that energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, which make up the bulk of greenhouse gases, had risen by 6% in 2021 to 36.3bn tonnes, their highest-ever level, as the global economy rebounded from the Covid-19 pandemic, relying heavily on coal to power the growth. The increase in global CO2 emissions was more than 2bn tonnes, the largest in history in absolute terms, outweighing the decline in emissions seen during the lockdowns of 2020. Renewable energy and energy efficiency offer alternatives to oil and gas, which the UK, the EU and the US are also pursuing. But if fossil fuel companies make decisions now to expand exploration and production, that will continue to result in high emissions for years and decades to come. Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power, a campaigning group in the US, said: “More drilling in more places isn’t a short-term fix, it’s a long-term problem that only makes oil and gas CEOs richer and locks us into more dependence on dirty, unreliable, expensive and volatile fossil fuels.”",News/Environment,Oil and gas companies are looking at a bonanza from the Ukraine war,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/10/oil-and-gas-companies-are-looking-at-a-bonanza-from-the-ukraine-war
3/10/2022,"Two weeks into Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the outcome of Vladimir Putin’s war remains in the balance, remarkably so. Uncertainty on this scale was not predicted on either side or by outside observers, all of whom expected a quicker, more decisive conflict. Putin’s miscalculations have instead catalysed new and dynamic factors that are still vigorously playing out – among them more effective Ukrainian resistance and stronger western unity – while exposing significant Russian incompetence. One factor, though, is as old and indestructible as the continent itself. When the dust of the Ukraine war settles in some way, and it will, the other nations of Europe will need to find an appropriate new form of relationship with Russia. This war, after all, is in large part the result of the failure of the old relationships that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. So it is not too soon to begin to consider what can be put in its place that, at the very least, makes a sustainable European peace between Russia and the liberal democracies more likely than another terrible war. What exactly should replace the now failed version of western policy towards Russia? Much depends on how the war ends. But not everything. The war will clearly be followed by a period of very deep mistrust. But a return to the status quo as it existed before 24 February is also highly improbable. Russia, Ukraine and western Europe are all now reshaping, as are the relationships between them. Solidarity with Ukraine is rightly the absolute priority while the war continues. It is also, it has to be admitted, the relatively straightforward bit for western policymakers and observers. For that reason alone, governments and even commentators also need to try to think in a larger frame than Ukraine’s suffering and heroism. Russia will survive the war in a different form. However, prewar assumptions about globalisation, national defence, the climate crisis, international order and even progress itself are now going to emerge looking different, too. This is Russia’s war. Nevertheless, other European states have not been merely passive players. These states, including Britain, also made wrong choices that helped feed Putin’s recklessness. Germany’s sudden policy switches on defence spending and gas are a dramatic illustration that the prewar years were marked with mistaken assumptions and policy failure. Britain’s hasty recent actions, imperfect though they may be, on Russian wealth, energy security and sporting contact make the same point. The need for a tougher, more pragmatic approach to Russia applies at the state level above all. The European Union and its main member states were not alone in letting their guards drop. Britain did so, too. In spite of many redactions to the published text, the parliamentary intelligence and security committee’s Russia report of 2019-20 charts with chilling clarity how the UK’s security services took their eye off hostile state activity, particularly from Russia, until the middle of the last decade. The larger reformulation of relationships with Russia will not be simple. The invasion of Ukraine is not the only reason. The roots lie deeper. Russia has very little extended tradition of democratic governance or the rule of law. Its institutions, other than the church, are relatively fragile. It has no western European partner that it trusts, or that trusts it, in the same way that, say, France and Italy trust one another, neither of them interfering in the other’s affairs. But Russians are not inhabitants of another planet. For large tracts of the past two centuries and more, however, it has been as though they were. In the 19th century, western liberals saw tsarist Russia as the embodiment of reaction and autocracy. For Britain, Russia was an imperial enemy, too, threatening control of the Indian subcontinent. Extreme Russophobes accused a British prime minister, Lord Palmerston, of being a Russian agent. In the 1850s none other than Karl Marx even argued that, from the time of Peter the Great in the early 18th century, Russia had become dedicated to global conquest. In the 20th century the traditional suspicions – which were often mutual – took on a different face after the Bolshevik revolution in 1917. For more than 70 years, authoritarian Russia was largely cut off from the west, after 1945 by the cold war’s iron curtain. When the Soviet Union collapsed, in 1991, all this was replaced, almost overnight, by a system in which there were almost no effective rules at all, as money and wealth poured westwards, the European Union built up big investments with the Kremlin, and security forces became preoccupied with jihadi terrorism. The naivety of the past 30 years has been discredited now, not before time. The west is scrambling to work out a new approach and, in time, a new relationship. Call it a third way between globalisation and the cold war, if you wish – but it is urgent and serious work. There is a danger, especially in this country and particularly under a meretricious prime minister like Boris Johnson, of the pendulum swinging too far towards a complete rupture and an entirely arm’s-length relationship, with little of what was often the very carefully calibrated reciprocity of the cold war. In his recently published book on the last 200 years of British-Russian relations – a book at once remarkably topical and yet suddenly also, since 24 February, substantially out of date – the former Labour foreign secretary David Owen makes a case for engagement. Writing in late 2021, Owen insisted that a more nuanced relationship was possible. He attacked Britain for disengaging from serious policymaking over Ukraine after the war of 2014. He also pointed out that Russia and Britain are in reality much more like one another than either of them likes to admit. Not least, both are 19th- and 20th-century imperial powers that are struggling to adjust to their relative eclipse. Read right now, Owen’s book will seem naively Russophile. But it addresses a question that matters: can the west agree about anything with Russia? That question has been swept to one side by the events of the last two weeks and by Ukraine’s stirring resistance. But neither Russia nor the question will go away. Echoing the French diplomat Talleyrand, the intelligence and security committee report observes that Russia is simultaneously always both too strong and too weak. Relations with such a nation will never be perfect. Yet the case for trying to make agreements applies to issues stretching from nuclear weapons to the rights of Ukrainians. If it was easy to answer the Russian question, there would be less to worry about. The answer is complex, which is exactly why the question remains such a live issue.

3/10/2022,"The New South Wales Liberals have reopened nominations in the federal seat of Warringah as the beleaguered party attempts to find a candidate to run against the independent MP Zali Steggall. The move comes after the state executive declined to back the only remaining nominee, Lincoln Parker, to contest the seat previously held by the former prime minister Tony Abbott. Several other nominees have withdrawn, fearing that the failure of the party to hold a preselection has left far too little time for candidates to run a viable campaign against Steggall, who holds the sat with with a 7.3% margin. The federal election must be held by May. The decision to reopen nominations clears the way for the disabilities campaigner David Brady, who is backed by the moderate faction, to shift his political ambitions to the northern beaches seat instead of the NSW Senate race. But Parker has told local branch members he will not bow out and will contest the preselection. Parker, who is not factionally aligned, told colleagues that he did not believe the seat was “owned” by the left of the party, and he “was not giving up”. If more than one person nominates, party rules require that there be a plebiscite which gives branch members the main say in who becomes the candidate. But the process laid out in the NSW Liberal party constitution takes weeks, and Steggall has already begun campaigning for re-election. On Wednesday the state executive rejected a plan proposed by the party’s deputy director, Simon McInnes, to shorten the timetable for plebiscites and allow the actual meetings to be held as online “tele-town halls”. Despite this, the NSW Liberal branch announced on Thursday that it would proceed with branch preselections via plebiscites using the longer timetable in Hughes, Parramatta and Eden Monaro. The actual face-to-face presentations by candidates and the ballots were currently scheduled to be held some time between 28 March and 31 March, and work was under way to finalise who is eligible to vote in each seat. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Under the party rules only people present at the in-person meetings can vote. Some of the people who take part in the plebiscites, such as party officials, representatives of the leaders, and members of state executive need to be at more than one preselection, so they cannot be held at the same time. But these dates are after the 25 March deadline set by the federal executive to resolve its long-running preselection delays. The party closed nominations in some seats in May 2021, but has been unable to finalise the vetting process due to delays which some in the party believe have been engineered by factional leaders for their own ends. It was unclear whether the Liberal party federal executive would regard the timetable as satisfactory.

A branch preselection in Hughes would mean that the right’s favoured candidate, Alex Dore, a former Young Liberal president, would not be eligible to run as he had not nominated. There were several other nominees in Hughes including the state MP for Holsworthy, Melanie Gibbons. It was unclear how and when a preselection would take place in Warringah if there was more than one nominee. The federal budget was due to be delivered on 29 March and the prime minister was expected to call the election soon after, leaving little time for newly endorsed candidates to become known in these key winnable electorates.",News/Australia news,NSW Liberals reopen nominations in Warringah in race to find candidate to run against Zali Steggall,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/10/nsw-liberals-reopen-nominations-in-warringah-in-race-to-find-candidate-to-run-against-zali-steggall
3/10/2022,"Hello, Warren Murray with enough to get you started. Western officials have warned of “serious concern” that Vladimir Putin could use chemical weapons on Kyiv as Russian propagandists spread what the US has called “false claims about alleged US biological weapons labs and chemical weapons development in Ukraine”. “We should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them,” wrote the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki. Experts have pointed to the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian conflict, where Russia is involved. The Kremlin has produced no evidence to support its weapons lab claims, which were called “preposterous” by Psaki and have been dismissed by Ukraine’s government. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called a Russian strike on a maternity hospital in Mariupol “the ultimate evidence of genocide”. Zelenskiy said children were buried under rubble and the regional governor said 17 people were wounded when the hospital was destroyed by a Russian airstrike on Wednesday afternoon. We have made a series of slider images from satellite photos to show how Mariupol has been hit. The UK is gearing up to send state-of-the-art Starstreak anti-aircraft weapons to Ukraine, as well as Javelin anti-tank missiles, and will continue to supply NLAW anti-tank weapons, the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has said. In the last few hours, the US has moved to drastically bolster support to war-ravaged Ukraine with a $13.6bn aid package. The House of Representatives voted to rush through the package that would increase military and humanitarian support. Senate approval is expected within days. It includes $6.5bn for the US costs of sending troops and weapons to eastern Europe and equipping allied forces there, and $6.8bn to care for refugees and provide economic support to allies. The House also passed a bill banning Russian oil imports. Make sure to keep up with further developments at our live blog. Chancellor’s spring dilemma – Rishi Sunak is facing intense pressure from Conservatives to take action in this month’s spring statement to alleviate the cost of living crisis, which has been exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Sunak’s February package of a £200 energy bill cut, to be paid back over five years, and a £150 council tax rebate have been criticised as too meagre to cushion the blow significantly for many households. Anti-poverty campaigners and thinktanks are calling on the chancellor to uprate benefits by more than the planned 3.1%, and many backbench Tories would love him to ditch the 1.25 percentage point increase in national insurance contributions, proceeds of which are earmarked to fix health and social care. Robert Halfon, the chair of the education select committee, has called on ministers to follow Ireland’s approach of cutting fuel duty. Bad drainage doomed train – A drainage system wrongly built by Carillion and unchecked by Network Rail led to the Stonehaven train crash. Three people died on 12 August 2020 in the worst fatal event on the UK railways in 18 years, when a Scotrail passenger train from Aberdeen to Glasgow derailed at Carmont, near Stonehaven, after hitting debris washed by heavy rain on to the track. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch also noted the outdated “crashworthiness” of the 1970s-built HST model involved. The train drivers’ union Aslef called for moves to immediately start to take the HST train type out of service. A separate report on the crash is due in coming months from the rail regulator, ORR, in conjunction with Scottish police and British Transport police. Covid rise in over-55s – Covid cases appear to be rising in older people as increased socialising, waning immunity and the more transmissible BA.2 Omicron variant threaten to fuel a resurgence of the virus. One in 35 people tested positive between 8 February and 1 March, with cases either level or rising in those aged 55 and over. Scientists on Imperial College’s React-1 study said the R value – the average number of people an infected person passes the virus to – remained below 1 for those aged 54 and under, meaning cases were in decline. But for those aged 55 and over, R stood at 1.04. Latest government figures show that as of this Tuesday there were 11,639 confirmed UK Covid-19 patients in hospital. Shrewsbury report delayed again – Families have voiced frustration after publication of the final report into the Shrewsbury and Telford maternity scandal was delayed for a second time. The Ockenden review investigated 1,862 maternity cases at the NHS trust in which mothers and babies may have been harmed over almost 20 years. It was delayed from December 2021 until this month, but this week families were told publication had been delayed again due to “parliamentary processes” that need to take place. Rhiannon Davies, whose daughter Kate Stanton-Davies died under the care of the trust shortly after she was born in 2009, said: “We’ve had this date ahead of us, everyone’s lives are on hold and we’re holding our breath to finally get this report.” A new date for the report’s delivery has yet to be confirmed. ‘Anti-feminist’ wins – South Korea has a new president: the conservative candidate Yoon Suk-yeol, who narrowly defeated the ruling party’s Lee Jae-myung with 48.6% of the vote to 47.8%. As an avowed “anti-feminist” he has pledged to abolish the ministry for gender equality, claiming South Korean women do not suffer systemic discrimination – despite voluminous evidence to the contrary. Yoon will be sworn in as president on 10 May, taking over from Moon Jae-in. South Korean presidents get a single five-year term. Nato has refused to intervene militarily in the Ukraine war. Dan Sabbagh explains what more the world’s most powerful military alliance could do – and why full intervention is off the table for now.

The Guardian print edition’s splash today is “‘An atrocity’: Russia bombs Ukraine children’s hospital” about which there is opprobrium everywhere. “Barbaric” says the Mirror which uses the same picture as the Guardian of a pregnant woman being stretchered out of the ruins. The Metro has “A new low for Putin – Russians hit baby hospital”. The Times underpins the same picture with “Aiming at mothers and babies” while the Daily Mail accompanies it with “Depraved” while the Express deplores “The ultimate in depravity”. The Financial Times says “Zelenskiy accuses Russians of hospital ‘atrocity’ in plea for world’s assistance”. “Evil upon evil” – the Sun shows a bloody-faced woman leaving the scene wrapped in a quilt. The same patient is shown on the front of the i picking her way down a mangled stairwell – that paper says “Putin bombs children’s hospital”. The Telegraph uses pictures of both the aforementioned victims while headlining its front-page lead “Russia ‘plotting chemical attack’”.
