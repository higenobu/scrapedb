3/11/2022,"The war in Ukraine has prompted a massive outpouring of support around the world. Some people are offering up their homes to host refugees. Others are organising collections of goods to send to people in Ukraine or neighbouring countries. But charities say donating cash to them is the best way to help those caught up in the crisis. Dan Walden, Unicef’s senior emergencies specialist, says that sending money, not goods, is the most efficient and effective way to distribute emergency aid. “We understand that it’s tempting for people to want to make donations that seem more personal to them: raiding their cupboards for items they can imagine being helpful,” he said. “But time is of the essence in Ukraine and we can get money transferred from our bank to a local bank in Ukraine within moments.” Giving cash transfers to trusted charities, whether international ones or those operating on the ground in Ukraine, is not wasteful, he says, does not create dependency and is empowering and effective. “It would take months to get goods transferred between countries and the logistics would be very complicated, time-consuming and expensive: usually more than the goods are worth.” Judith Escribano, the director of communications at Action Against Hunger, agrees. “We understand why people like to donate goods in an emergency but we can’t send food, clothes, blankets or medical equipment from the UK, even if they’re in perfect condition. “We don’t have the capacity to sort the goods here or to distribute them once there. It’s usually much easier to buy items in the countries where they are needed. It’s also usually cheaper and helps local markets and economies, helping countries to get back on their feet.” Escribano points to the carbon footprint of driving goods 1,500 miles when they could be bought in a shop in Poland, Moldova or Romania. But almost more importantly, she says, it is a question of dignity. “It’s a dignified way of giving people support. It lets people know we trust them. It gives people freedom and power when they have none.” Not only is this a fast-moving situation, but experts say the implications are likely to be long-lasting and charities will need continued support. Humanitarian aid charities are practised in delivering funds over the long term, they say, so monetary donations might contribute towards the relief effort and help to resettle families further down the line. But Mark Greer, the managing director of philanthropy services at the Charities Aid Foundation, said they recognise it might not be feasible for some people to give financially at the moment. “If people want to donate goods and supplies, it’s worth speaking to international aid charities – like the Red Cross or Save the Children – first to see what’s most needed and how they can help.” Support local charities There are several Ukrainian charities working on the ground. Sunflower of Peace is a charity that helps paramedics and doctors, and has been fundraising for supplies, which includes first aid medical tactical backpacks. United Help Ukraine focuses on providing medical supplies and humanitarian aid, and raising awareness of the conflict. Voices of Children aims to help children affected by the war in eastern Ukraine, providing support through art therapy, psychologists, video storytelling and a number of other methods. The British Red Cross has launched an emergency appeal to help Ukraine. The charity will be updating its webpage with news on the work its team is doing, and how support will be used to help people. Support local journalism English-language news outlets based in the country, such as Kyiv Independent and the New Voice of Ukraine, are covering developments on the ground as the conflict unfolds, using local journalists. The Kyiv Independent says it was created by journalists in order to defend editorial independence. This site on Twitter covers many local journalists in Ukraine. Write to your local MP This can be a way to lobby the British government to place further sanctions on the Russian government and its associates. You can get in touch with your local MP via email or post to their constituency address. Instructions on how to get in touch can be found on parliament.uk. But, he says, if donors give food or medical supplies in the UK, in addition to having to pay shipping costs to neighbouring countries, there are extra benefits charities lose out on. “UK charities can claim gift aid on monetary donations which means that they effectively receive an extra 25% in extra funding. For example, a £50 charitable donation by a UK taxpayer is worth £62.50 to a charity because they can claim back tax,” he said. “Employees can also use ‘give as you earn’, also known as payroll giving, to set up tax-effective charitable donations directly from your wages which works in a similar way to a salary sacrifice arrangement,” he added. “Employees can choose which charity to support and we have seen many using give as you earn to support the Ukraine refugee crisis in this way.”",News/World news, Ukraine humanitarian crisis: what is the most effective way to help?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/ukraine-humanitarian-crisis-what-is-the-most-effective-way-to-help
3/11/2022,"Churchillian echoes from Volodymyr Zelenskiy stiffened the sinews and summoned up the blood of the House of Commons: “We will fight in the forests, in the fields, the shores and in the streets.” Each of us, distant spectators of unfolding catastrophe, tries to imagine those missiles pulverising our streets, willing Zelenskiy and his country to survive. But, being human, even in our darkest hour we cleave to another wartime maxim attributed to Churchill: never let a good crisis go to waste. Look around in Britain and you can see all sides scurrying to make good use of this. You could call it cynical opportunism – or if you have a more benign view of human nature, it’s a natural impulse to rescue some hope from Putin’s hell. Start with the left, the internationalists, the progressives, the social democrats, living for ever in hope that events will prove us so incontrovertibly right that more people will swing our way, ending the electoral hegemony of Conservatism. The first light in the tunnel: Britain is back close to Europe. Without gloating or saying we told you so, it is worth pointing out that this war proves, beyond geography, that Britain’s destiny is European. In defence, as in trade, we belong inalienably to this democratic neighbourhood. Europe is us, physically, politically and psychologically, while “global Britain” was a vacuous nothing. Ukraine yearns to join, so ask them if Brussels is the “EUSSR” of that crass Brexit slogan. Last week, the EU invited the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, to its Foreign Affairs Council meeting for the first time since Brexit. In a double somersault, Truss called it “vitally important” that the UK and its allies “show complete unity”. Most who caused Brexit fall silent, leaving only the Europhobic fringe sounding off: Steve Baker, of the European Research Group, called for Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol to be triggered “immediately” while on a visit to Belfast last week. But fighting the EU over sausages on the Irish border is far out of step with the times. The spasm of xenophobia that was spread by the Brexiteers has lifted, too. A YouGov poll has found three-quarters of voters want Ukrainians admitted immediately without visas. Johnson will be dogged by the shame of Tory mean-spiritedness as other countries threw open their borders. The divide between climate activists and petrol-heads has been deepened by this war, too. Ending oil and gas dependency is now clearly a defence as well as a climate priority; the need to accelerate renewables, home insulation and heat pump installation, to make net zero reachable has never felt more urgent. Look, the possibility of an energy-generating barrage on the Severn estuary is back on the agenda. Energy independence has become a security issue, says Adair Turner, chair of the Energy Transitions Commission, calling on consumers to defeat Putin. Cutting road speeds to 55mph and turning down central heating would “make an immediate impact” on Russia, he says. But against him stands FairFuelUK, “the real voice of the UK’s 37m drivers”, seizing its chance for petrol tax cuts after years of frightening the government out of fuel tax rises. Thirst for gas and oil exposes western dependence on other dictators – the Saudis, Qatar – while US emissaries are suddenly visiting the outcast Maduro of Venezuela. “Climate sceptics” and oil company-funded pressure groups seize on the new energy gap as their big chance, too. “Frack us out of the fuel crisis, Boris!” – the Mail reports as Craig Mackinlay rallies his Net Zero Security Group of Tories. Johnson always appeases his right: sealing off shale gas wells does “not make sense,” he says now, never mind the years it would take to reap any supposed benefits from the wells. Nigel Farage is on the move, too, calling for a referendum to kill off net-zero targets and the “ruinous” green agenda. As for the prime minister, Ukraine is his hope of salvation: surely, war is no time for a leadership election over parties long forgotten? War may save his skin when the police and Sue Gray eventually come knocking. Watch the retreat of erstwhile Tory enemies such as Rory Stewart: “I think he’s a terrible human being. I think he’s a terrible prime minister, but I think he’s done OK on the Ukraine crisis.” Here’s another hope: war may stop the government’s assault on the BBC, Britain’s greatest global influencer. How like Putin does Johnson want to be? Another hope is for an end to the London laundromat hiding money filched from other citizens. But will the City be cleansed or just whitewashed? And there’s the economy: as the war deepens the cost-of-living calamity, the chancellor can’t avoid a U-turn in his spring statement. Tory MPs join Labour in calling a halt to April’s unequal national insurance rise. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, says people are “willing to endure hardships” in solidarity with Ukraine. But will the public demand equality in who bears that pain? Millions of the hard-pressed will join battalions of the absolutely poor neither heating nor eating unless this talk of “sacrifice” summons genuine wartime fairness, tapping into wealth to guarantee enough for everyone. Will we all be in this together? The old tug-of-war between tax rises and spending cuts is unabated, the likes of Roger Bootle, chair of Capital Economics, saying defence spending may have to rise to 4% at the expense of cuts. But from which already starved services: the NHS? Schools? Border Force? The right never says. The chancellor needs to eat the words in his ill-judged Mais lecture promising tax cuts. Putin may succeed militarily in the near future, though he may never hold down Ukraine – that vast, rebellious country. On the home front, the question is what the war will do to us. The left always lives in optimism that fairer and greener choices will prevail, but the left is also used to disappointment. The fight is on to see if this brings out the best in us, and not the worst.

3/11/2022,"The astonishingly rich programme of the first Dance Reflections festival, spread across three major London venues, is an opportunity not only to see a range of what you might call non-classical dance, but to catch cross-currents between artists, styles and times. Its opening night paired a brand new creation with an iconic work from 1979. Contemporary dancer Brigel Gjoka and “abstract b-boy” Rauf “RubberLegz” Yasit first met as performers in William Forsythe’s superlative Quiet Evening of Dance, and their duet Neighbours echoes its trajectory: a stark opening section, dense with motion but performed in plain clothes and unadorned by music, gives way to more theatrically lit, dressed and accompanied dances, flush with moods and meanings. It’s like seeing the work’s bones first, and only then its flesh. The bones, here, are not only the two distinctive performers – Gjoka both poised and fleet, Yasit slipping through the ribbony knots of his own limbs – but also the remarkable detail of their interaction: little parries and feints, locks and tugs and weaves. When it arrives, the spellbinding music (played live by Ruşan Filiztek) layers Turkic drones, chants and beats over the dance, and suddenly we not only see the physical structure of this particular encounter, but seem to sense a place, people, histories that are elusive, but potent. Lucinda Childs’ now classic Dance (performed here by the Lyon Opera Ballet) was made in an era when systems theory and structuralism were in the zeitgeist – and it shows. The work is all about composition: the relation of one element to another, the formation of complexity from simplicity. Dressed in celestial white, the dancers use a limited lexicon throughout – little more than step, hop, skip and jump – balletically styled, and performed without affect or affectation. In section one, they skim from side to side across the stage. In section two, a soloist travels either in a straight line, or in a circle. In section three, the groups square up, or do diagonals. Around, in front and above them, Sol LeWitt’s film of Child’s original company performing the same work multiplies the dancing figures as well as their angle and scale. It’s all of a piece with Philip Glass’s music: steps, images, bodies and sounds refracted into cosmic harmonics that echo in the mind long after the performance is over. The Dance Reflections festival continues at Sadler’s Wells, the RoyalOpera House and Tate Modern until 23 March.",Arts/Stage,Dance Reflections festival: opening night review – rich and revelatory,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/mar/10/dance-reflections-festival-opening-night-review-rich-and-revelatory
3/11/2022,"Researchers have categorised more than 80,000 plant species worldwide and found that most of them will “lose” in the face of humanity – going extinct because people don’t need them. This means that plant communities of the future will be hugely more homogenised than those of today, according to the paper published in the journal Plants, People, Planet. The findings, which paint a stark picture of the threat to biodiversity, cover less than 30% of all known plant species, and as such are a “wake-up call”, say the researchers, highlighting the need for more work in this field. “We’re actually beginning to quantify what’s going to make it through the bottleneck of the Anthropocene, in terms of numbers,” said John Kress, botany curator emeritus at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History and lead author of the paper. “It’s not the future, it’s happening. The bottleneck is starting to happen right now. And I think that’s part of the wake-up call that we are trying to give here. It’s something we might be able to slow down a little bit, but it’s happening.” Researchers at the Smithsonian Institution set out to categorise exactly which plant species have been most affected by humans since the start of the Anthropocene – the geological epoch marked by profound human impact on Earth, in which humans have been responsible for global heating, deforestation, and other negative results of industrialisation. They analysed data on 86,592 vascular plant species, gathering information from international databases about the different uses for these plants: whether they’re crops, which are economically important to humans, invasive weed plant species, endangered species that need to be protected or rare species which are involved in illegal trade, for example. From this information, they created a categorisation of how the plants are faring and will fare in the future, describing eight distinct categories, and concluding that many more species of plants will be pushed to extinction by human activity on Earth, rather than aided. There are 6,749 plants which are winners and are helpful to humans such as corn, rice, wheat and other crops, which cover 40% of the surface of the planet, and plants which have gone extinct in the wild but are surviving in cities, such as the ginkgo tree, planted on every block of New York City, according to Kress. Then there are 164 plants which are winners and aren’t useful to humans, mainly invasive, weedy species such as the kudzu, also known as “the vine that ate the south”. About 20,290 species of plants are categorised as losers, mostly because they are not useful to humans, and they’re already recognised as endangered species – such as the magnolia tree from Haiti, which was cut down for firewood and does not grow anywhere else. Smaller lineages of plant species – such as cycads, the cypress family such as redwoods and junipers, and an ancient family of conifers called the araucariales – are most likely to disappear completely. The scientists branded 26,002 species as potential losers, and 18,664 species as potential winners. The last two categories are those of plants currently considered neutral, and 571 plant species which have already gone extinct. The results suggest that, in the future, there will be a lot less biodiversity, which in turn will drive a loss of animal diversity, and make ecosystems even more vulnerable in the face of extreme weather, changes in climate, or more degradation due to human impact. “The authors used a dataset of 86,592 which represents about 25% of the world’s vascular plants,” said Barnabas Daru, assistant professor of biology at Texas A&M University, who was not involved in this study. “This means that we are missing a huge chunk of the puzzle, especially the vast knowledge gaps in some of the world’s most floristically diverse but poorly sampled regions such as South America, Africa and south-east Asia.” Daru points out that there are other datasets that could help complete the picture and, possibly, show a different pattern for winners and losers. With enough effort, any plant can be saved from extinction, said Richard Corlett, professor at the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, who was not involved in the study – for example, in living collections, in seed banks or in cryogenic tissue storage. That’s why there should be a stronger call for zero plant extinction, Corlett argues, and findings like these should sound the alarm and spur action. “How many people can name a threatened plant?” said Corlett. “Plant conservation is not like animal conservation, where we continue to lose species despite efforts to save them. In plant conservation, there are no hopeless cases, at least in regards to extinction.”",News/Environment,"Plants humans don’t need are heading for extinction, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/10/plants-humans-dont-need-extinction-biodiversity-study
3/11/2022,"“Don’t you sit in our chair.” It was just a moment in the middle of the madness, another picture of a wild, epic night with all its drama and its silliness too, but David Alaba had summed it up somehow. As the Santiago Bernabéu lost its collective mind on Wednesday and Karim Benzema slipped to his knees, fists clenched, the Austrian picked up a white plastic chair and raised it triumphantly to the sky. Iconic and, when he chose to caption it, symbolic too: you don’t just unseat Real Madrid. “We’re the Kings of Europe!” the banner had declared before the game; by the end of it, they were singing the same line, still there, still unmoved, the state unable to overthrow them, the significance of this meeting made all the more profound by the power battle that divides these clubs. For Paris Saint-Germain, the European Cup has become an obsession that deepens with every year that passes, like this one will, without them winning it. By the time the club were founded, Real Madrid had six of them. Since the Qataris took over, Madrid have won four. Some things money can’t buy, at least not yet – and not just the trophy. Frustration at that, a feeling of injustice and impotence, was expressed when the PSG owner, Naseer Al-Khelaifi left the directors box to confront the referee after the game, in scenes Monica Marchante, the Spanish TV reporter who witnessed them, described as “frankly unpleasant”. Real Madrid have 13 European Cups. Theirs is a history, an identity built on the implausible that is partly self-perpetuating. There is something there. “Magic,” their manager, Carlo Ancelotti, called it. “History matters, history plays,” the former Madrid winger Míchel says. “No one knows why but when you pull on that Real Madrid shirt you become a mini Incredible Hulk.” That poses the question: what is the opposite of a mini Incredible Hulk? Because he was also there. It matters, Míchel says, that opponents know Madrid’s history. Jorge Valdano, a former general manager at Madrid, came up with two concepts that were played out again: stage fright and football as an estado de ánimo, a state of mind, an emotional condition. Gianluigi Donnarumma’s dreadful mistake “totally changed the game, totally changed the atmosphere in the stadium”, Ancelotti said, the Bernabéu suddenly smelling blood and PSG all too aware it was theirs. They hadn’t been in it until then, but suddenly Madrid knew and PSG knew. “A club that has 13 European Cups doesn’t win by chance; it’s something deep in their guts,” Mauricio Pochettino said before the game. Now, his PSG team crumpled before his eyes. It is not the first time. Madrid were in their area three times in the three minutes after the first goal. The ball was in play for 12seconds between the second goal and the third. The opening goal had transformed everything. “We were the better team and it’s so disappointing that the motion of the game changed because of this situation and it’s so difficult because you give Real Madrid the belief and you’re at the Bernabéu,” Pochettino said. “It’s difficult to manage this situation and the team was so affected.” If it was worth asking why the impact was quite so great, why PSG were so fragile, so incapable of resisting the changing tide, and what that says about them, their coach preferred to focus on how it had happened in the first place. On the moment that promoted the collapse: as far as he was concerned, Benzema had fouled Donnarumma. As far as the keeper was concerned as well. “It’s not an error because it’s a clear foul,” he said. “I have seen the footage 30 or 40 times from all angles. Small details count and the VAR didn’t see a decisive foul.” Big details count too, broader, almost intangible elements that make these clubs different. This was hard for PSG to accept and their coach didn’t. When BT’s Phil Kitromilides opened his post-match interview with, “Mauricio, it’s hard to explain what happened,” the former Spurs manager shot back, almost trembling: “No, no, it’s not difficult. It’s so clear. To concede the goal we conceded it’s unbelievable. It’s impossible to accept.” “It’s so unfair to talk about different things because that changed completely the way the game was … complete, complete, changed the motion, changed everything and after we do some mistakes but when something very, very unfair happens it is difficult for the players to keep calm on the pitch.” Off the pitch was no easier. At the full-time whistle, Al-Khelaifi – not just PSG’s owner but the president of the European Club Association – was furious, hitting walls and shouting. He headed to the referee’s room, or what he thought was the referee’s room, only to come across the former referee Megía Dávila, who is Madrid’s match-day delegate. When he did encounter the match referee, Danny Makkelie, the confrontation continued and he broke the linesman’s flag, according to the official’s formal report. Sources at Madrid said security had to be called and that Al-Khelaifi turned on a member of staff who was recording the scene on his phone, shouting: “I’ll kill you.” Leonardo, PSG’s sporting director, then allegedly demanded the recording be deleted, yet another image they would rather not be confronted with again. Defeat hurt, another opportunity gone, and it was hard to avoid the conclusion that the one really, really good thing they have will soon be gone: in front of his parents, who were invited to the Bernabéu by the hosts, Kylan Mbappé gave another superb performance before fans who are already applauding him and who trust that he will soon be wearing their shirt. History plays there, too, and so does this stadium, the magic that gripped them all. Which is another reason why it wasn’t just this year’s European Cup that felt like it slipped from PSG’s grasp, Real Madrid’s seat still not for sitting in.",Sport/Football,PSG feel the full force of history in dispiriting loss to Real Madrid | Sid Lowe,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/10/psg-full-force-of-history-loss-real-madrid
3/11/2022,"A woman who hit a police officer on the head with a skateboard during last year’s riot in Bristol has been jailed for five and a half years. Mariella Gedge-Rogers, 27, also climbed on to the roof of the Bridewell police station in the centre of Bristol and threw missiles at officers. During the violence that erupted in March 2021 after a peaceful “kill the bill” protest, officers were attacked, their vehicles set on fire and the police station vandalised. Video footage released by the police shows Gedge-Rogers, from the Clifton area of the city, telling the officer she hit “I know you’re a human being”, to which he replies: “You’ve just hit me with a skateboard though.” She says: “I did do that, yes.” She was also seen throwing objects at other officers from the police station roof and repeatedly striking the front window of the building with her skateboard before passing it to a man for him to do the same. Judge James Patrick, sentencing Gedge-Rogers, said: “You used your skateboard as a weapon and threw missiles and objects. You had had a considerable amount of drink.” Speaking of the impact of the rioting on officers, Patrick said: “Vile abuse was directed at the police. At least one firework was discharged, officers were pulled from their lines. They were physically attacked, some with missiles, some with weapons, and others were struck, spat on, kicked and punched.” He added: “Experienced police officers, some with military experience, describe it movingly. One with significant services experience described it as one of the most frightening experiences in his career.” Another said it was “like a war zone”. Patrick accepted Gedge-Rogers had shown remorse and was ashamed of what she had done. “People who knew you identify that you have behaved out of character,” he said. Gedge-Rogers, who was convicted by a jury of riot, will be expected to serve half her sentence in custody and the other half on licence. Avon and Somerset police were criticised by some activists at subsequent “kill the bill” demonstrations for what they said was heavy-handed tactics with horses and dogs being used to disperse protesters. Kannan Siva, defending, said Gedge-Rogers acted out of character and contributory factors were her complex mental health issues and alcohol consumption. He told the court she attended the 21 March protest with peaceful intentions but her behaviour changed after she was forcibly restrained.

3/11/2022,"Aday or so after Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine, Sergiy Skorokhvatov decided it might not be a bad idea to go online and clarify what kind of food was on the menu at his Russian and Ukrainian restaurant in central Madrid. His instincts proved correct. Despite the fact that Skorokhvatov is Ukrainian, and despite the fact that the family’s restaurant serves both Ukrainian and Russian food, its name – Rasputin – swiftly incurred the wrath of some keyboard warriors. “Someone called me and said it was a good move because another Russian restaurant had been getting reviews saying things like ‘We shouldn’t be spending any of our euros in Russian places’,” Skorokhvatov told the Guardian. “I thought that changing things would help us, but then people started posting similar stuff about us – ‘Don’t go to Russian restaurants’ – and pictures of blown-up buildings in Ukraine.” Skorokhvatov, whose parents are still in Kyiv, managed to get Google to take down the political reviews and photos. He is now weighing up whether to change the name of the restaurant his family bought almost four years ago. His experiences are just one example of the many ways in which people around the world are venting their fury at Russia’s campaign in Ukraine. Earlier this week Maison de la Poutine, a French restaurant chain serving the French-Canadian favourite poutine – chips, cheese curds and gravy – complained of receiving insults and threats because of the similarity, in French, between the name of the emblematic dish and that of the bellicose Russian president. On Wednesday, the Cardiff Philharmonic Orchestra announced that it had decided to exclude Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture from a performance next week. It explained that playing the piece – which commemorates Russia’s victory over Napoleon’s invading forces – would be “inappropriate” given events in Ukraine. Others have opted for more direct action. In Ireland, opposition to the Russian invasion has been focused on the country’s embassy in Dublin, whose gates were forced open after a truck deliberately reversed in to the estate earlier this week. The driver, who was charged with criminal damage, said he had felt compelled to act after seeing the pictures that went around the world of a woman and her children lying dead on the street in Irpin. A priest was also arrested last week after dousing the embassy gates with red paint. “I feel frightened and powerless,” Father Fergal MacDonagh said. “The only thing I could do was, in solidarity with the people of Ukraine, to pour paint on the gates on the building that is spreading lies and deceit and misinformation about what is happening.” The priest added that he would be “delighted” to be charged. Local councillors are taking a longer-term approach, and have voted to change the name of the street where the embassy is situated from Orwell Road to Independent Ukraine Road. Similar thinking is under way in Jerusalem, where the Putin pub has become “the pub formerly known as the Putin”.The 20-year-old institution on Jaffa Street, the main drag in west Jerusalem, is beloved for its cheap drinks, convivial atmosphere and, occasionally, its Russian-language karaoke. Its former owners decided to call it Putin as a gimmick: they opened when the former KGB lieutenant colonel was running for president for the first time. But on the day the Russian leader invaded Ukraine, the current owner, Leonid Teterin, removed the big gold letters spelling out “Putin” from the sign. “We condemn the war and support Ukraine and its people,” Teterin, a Russian-born Israeli, told Israel’s Channel 12 news. Staff have been asking customers to suggest a new name. The most popular idea so far is the Zelenskiy pub in honour of Ukraine’s Jewish president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Bars and restaurants in Brazil’s culinary capital, São Paulo, have also embarked on a nomenclature offensive. On Tuesday, the celebrated Brazilian chef Janaína Rueda announced she would protest Putin’s “sad war” by refusing to serve stroganoff at her restaurant in São Paulo. “This is our way of showing our support for the Ukrainians … We’re rooting for peace,” Rueda said. The defiance, however, was short-lived and the stroganoff boycott was reversed after 24 hours following an online backlash against what many saw as a pointless gesture. At least half a dozen cocktail bars have also taken the Moscow Mule off their menu – and replaced it with the Kyiv or Ukraine Mule. As he waited for the lunchtime crowd to arrive in Madrid on Thursday, Skorokhvatov tried to explain how he felt about the manner in which some people were responding to the war in his homeland. “I understand the passion – and that people want to do something to help but don’t know how,” he said. “So some of them go online and post stuff. I’m a little surprised by how some people are, I guess. They’re short-sighted and don’t do any research.” But, added Skorokhvatov, others had found far more useful ways to express their solidarity: “You can go and donate and you hear of people getting in their cars and going to Ukraine without even knowing where they’re going.”",News/World news,Tchaikovsky and Moscow Mules off: consumers vent fury over Ukraine invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/10/ukraine-war-sparks-anti-russian-consumer-protests-and-action-worldwide
3/11/2022,"A UN expert has warned of the creation of pollution “sacrifice zones” across the world, where tens of millions of people are suffering strokes, cancers, respiratory problems and heart disease as a result of toxic contamination of the environment. “There are sacrifice zones all over the world, in every region: in the north, in the south, in the east, in the west, in rich countries, in poor countries,” David Boyd told the Guardian. Boyd, the special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, cited physical health issues, including cancer, heart disease, respiratory illness, strokes and reproductive health problems, as well as “incredible mental health problems associated with living in these places because people feel exploited, they feel stigmatised”. All of this infringed their human rights, Boyd said. “Their rights to life, their rights to health, and … their right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment. You cannot reconcile that fundamental right to a healthy environment with these absolutely horrific environmental conditions.” In a report due to be presented to the UN human rights council on Thursday, Boyd says pollution contributed to twice as many premature deaths as Covid-19 in the first 18 months of the coronavirus pandemic. Giving the death toll from pollution in that period is a staggering 9 million, the report adds: “One in six deaths in the world involves diseases caused by pollution, three times more than deaths from Aids, malaria and tuberculosis combined and 15 times more than from all wars, murders and other forms of violence. “The toxification of planet Earth is intensifying,” Boyd’s report warns, pointing out that even as some harmful chemicals are banned or abandoned, overall production of chemicals doubled between 2000 and 2017, and will double again by 2030. And while everyone was affected to some degree, some communities were being hit far more than others. “If you look at these places that I’ve highlighted in the report, pollution on our planet today is pervasive, it’s affecting everyone but it’s affecting some people in a really grossly unfair and disproportionate way,” Boyd told the Guardian. “The United States, one of the wealthiest countries in the world, one of the wealthiest countries in all of human history, is home to one of the worst sacrifice zones on the planet. This place, it’s called ‘cancer alley’, in Louisiana, where there are more than a hundred oil refineries, petrochemical plants, etc,” he said. “And guess where they’re located? In poor, predominantly black communities. It’s just, as I said, it’s unconscionable.” Other sacrifice zones included:  Kabwe, Zambia, where 95% of children had elevated levels of lead in their blood, putting them at risk of lifelong intellectual impairment,  The Pata Rât landfill in Romania, where thousands of Roma people live and are exposed to arsenic, lead, mercury and other pollutants.  The French overseas territories of Guadeloupe and Martinique, in the Caribbean, where 90% of people were found to have the carcinogenic pesticide chlordecone in their blood. Businesses were the main culprit, with most happy to overlook social and environmental costs in favour of their bottom line, Boyd said, adding that money was “the main barrier to addressing the climate crisis, to addressing biodiversity loss and to addressing pervasive pollution”. He called on governments to impose strong regulation on corporations causing pollution – and to stop spending an estimated $1.8tn a year on subsidies for environmentally damaging industries. “[Oil and gas companies are] not going to voluntarily stop producing oil and gas; big coal companies are not going to voluntarily shift from being big coal companies to being big solar and wind companies: governments have to do that, that’s their job, it’s governments that have the obligations to respect, protect and fulfil our human rights,” Boyd said. But there was cause for optimism, he said. Boyd’s report comes six months after the human rights council recognised for the first time that everyone had a human right to live in a clean, healthy and sustainable environment. “And this is really a key point,” he said. Previous agreements on biodiversity, climate change and pollution were formerly unenforceable. “But guess what: when you weld the international environmental agreements together with human rights law, human rights law brings into the equation institutions, processes, accountability. “That’s what’s really exciting about this UN recognition of a right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment – it signals this union of human rights law and environmental law which can be an extremely powerful catalyst of the kinds of transformative changes that we so desperately need.”",News/Environment," Millions suffering in deadly pollution ‘sacrifice zones’, warns UN expert",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/10/millions-suffering-in-deadly-pollution-sacrifice-zones-warns-un-expert
