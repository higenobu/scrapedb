3/25/2022,"The consortiums bidding for Chelsea led by Todd Boehly and Sir Martin Broughton have been told they are on the shortlist to buy the club. The groups have been informed by Raine Group, the US bank handling the sale, that they have progressed to the next stage of a process that will end with Chelsea being taken out of Roman Abramovich’s hands. Boehly, part-owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, has teamed up with investors including the Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss and Jonathan Goldstein, a British businessman who is the CEO of Cain International and a Tottenham fan. They are understood to have been among the first groups to bid and were confident from the word go of striking a deal. The Times columnist and Conservative peer Daniel Finkelstein and the PR executive Barbara Charone – both Chelsea season-ticket holders – are part of the consortium. Broughton is also a Chelsea fan and has another, Sebastian Coe, in his group. Among the backers are the US investors Josh Harris and David Blitzer, who own the Philadelphia 76ers basketball franchise and are Crystal Palace shareholders. They will have to end their involvement with Palace if selected to buy Chelsea. Financial muscle is also offered by Creative Artists Agency, a US company whose portfolio includes the football agency Base, and Evolution Media Capital. Nick Candy, another Chelsea supporter, is among other bidders and is in talks with another interested party regarding potentially teaming up if his consortium is not included on the shortlist. He has backing from, among others, the South Korean Hana Financial Group. The Ricketts family, who own the Chicago Cubs baseball team, were on Friday morning still hopeful they could make the shortlist. Their bid has faced a huge backlash on social media after it emerged that Joe Ricketts, the family’s patriarch, was accused of Islamophobia three years ago. The Ricketts family has said it “rejects any form of hate in the strongest possible terms”. A bid from Saudi Media Group is known to have been rejected by Raine, which will take its preferred offers to Chelsea and Abramovich for them to select their No 1 option. That choice will next be referred to the Premier League for consideration under its owners’ and directors’ test. If that is passed the government will finally be asked to provide a licence to sell the club.",Sport/Football,Chelsea sale: Boehly and Broughton bids make shortlist to buy club,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/25/chelsea-sale-boehly-and-broughton-bids-make-shortlist-to-buy-club-roman-abramovich
3/25/2022,"A group of veteran Russian human rights activists plan to publish an open letter calling on Russia to end its war in Ukraine, declaring it “our common duty” to “stop the war, protect the lives, rights and freedoms of all people, both Ukrainians and Russians”. The “manifesto”, signed by 11 prominent activists including Lev Ponomaryov, Oleg Orlov, and Svetlana Gannushkina, announces the creation of a new anti-war council of Russian human rights defenders and is the broadest collective statement against the war by the Russian human rights community to date. The activists say they will seek to help Russians avoid taking part in the war against Ukraine and to demand that the Ministry of Defence releases accurate information about the number of Russian soldiers killed in the war. “Russian citizens are being involved in military operations on the territory of Ukraine, where they become accomplices in war crimes and die themselves,” a draft statement says. “Our first goal is to help them avoid this, relying on the constitution and Russian legislation, and to assist all those who are illegally forced to participate in hostilities.” The activists’ second goal is to provide legal assistance to the families of Russian military personnel who “find themselves in an information vacuum”. “There is no official updated information about the dead, about the transfer of bodies to families, about prisoners, about their release or exchange,” the letter says. “It is difficult or impossible for relatives to find out what has become of their sons and husbands, or to get the bodies of the dead.” The manifesto comes amid a surge of pressure on anti-war protesters, who have been targeted with arrest and intimidation, the closure of Russian media outlets including Echo of Moscow for violating censorship laws and new legislation for publishing “fakes” about the Russian military that can lead to up to 15 years in prison. “Russia invaded the territory of Ukraine, starting a full-scale war unprecedented in recent history,” the letter says. “This war has neither just grounds nor a just purpose. The international court of justice of the United Nations recognised the grounds of the ‘special military operation’ declared by Russia as illegal, has demanded an immediate end to the aggression and withdrawal of troops. “But the fighting, bombing and shelling continue, levelling cities and vital infrastructure to the ground. Millions of residents of Ukraine have become refugees, many thousands have died – both civilians (among them – more than a hundred children), and military personnel from both sides.” The manifesto announces the creation of a council of human rights defenders in Russia whose goal is to coordinate the actions under the “new conditions” of working in Russia. The signatories are some of Russia’s best-known human rights activists, including Ponomaryov, the founder of the For Human Rights NGO and a former member of the Duma, Orlov and Alexander Chersakov of the Memorial human rights group, and Gannushkina, the founder of the the Civic Assistance Committee NGO. Several signatories to the manifesto “are not listed for security reasons”. A number of professional communities including doctors, academics, IT workers and others have published open letters in protest against the war in Ukraine, which began more than a month ago. Many groups have since been forced to hide the list of signatories after pressure from the government or from pro-Kremlin organisations. Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader sentenced to an additional nine years in prison this week, has also called on Russians to attend anti-war protests. “You need to go to anti-war rallies every weekend, even if it seems that everyone has either left or got scared ... You are the backbone of the movement against war and death.” In the letter the activists write that the war in Ukraine was a consequence of a culture of impunity for human rights. “The war that has broken out in the centre of Europe is a consequence and continuation of Russia’s long-term refusal to protect the rights and freedoms of its citizens and all those under its jurisdiction – once again recalled the unlearned lesson of the second world war: a state that grossly and massively violates human rights within its borders sooner or later becomes a threat to peace and international security,” the letter says. “The lack of a proper reaction of the international community to these processes during the post-Soviet decades also contributed to the tragic development of events.”",News/World news,Russian activists sign open letter calling for end to war in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/russian-activists-sign-open-letter-calling-for-end-to-war-in-ukraine

3/25/2022,"The world is in the midst of an anxiety epidemic, and it’s no wonder, according to Dr Ellen Vora. Modern life is fraught with stressors, ranging from our phones to an “always on” work culture and underexposure to sunlight. But, she argues, our understanding of this crisis is in need of an overhaul. In her warm and highly readable new book, The Anatomy of Anxiety, Vora makes a compelling case that anxious people should tackle the condition not just in their minds but in their bodies. That begins with sorting unease into two categories: “false anxiety” and “true anxiety”. Both cause real suffering, but each one calls for a very different approach. False anxiety, as Vora describes it, is largely rooted in our physical health. We might feel anxious because we’re chronically sleep deprived, or over-caffeinated, or eating too much junk food. All this can provoke a stress response in our bodies, which send a message to our brains: something’s off. “At these times, our minds are all too happy to swoop in with an explanation,” Vora writes, and we decide that it’s relationship issues, a recent email from work, or fears about the news that have us on edge. This should come as a relief, because it means there are fairly simple steps we can take to rectify the situation. Vora, who describes herself as a holistic psychiatrist, focuses on changes we can make to our daily habits. Many of her suggestions feel achievable: minimise blue light exposure late in the day; eat more vegetables; limit social media use. Others seem more daunting, including quitting sugar altogether. But Vora writes with compassion and is rarely prescriptive, noting that acting on even a few of her suggestions will be beneficial and urging readers not to be overcautious about diet: “The multifaceted pleasures of food are, in themselves, powerful medicine for anxiety.” Once we’ve eliminated these sources of false anxiety, we can turn to what Vora calls true anxiety. This is any unsettled feeling that remains, “which we can think of as an emotional compass telling us something is not OK”. Perhaps it’s a signal that we’re following the wrong path in our career or relationships, or distress at the state of the world and a sense we should take action. Instead of trying to erase this sensation, we should embrace it: “Our uneasy feelings are no longer the enemy or something to vanquish – they become our tools and allies instead.” It’s a redeeming way to look at the condition, as not merely a burden but ultimately a blessing. As Vora shifts to focus on true anxiety, the book becomes unexpectedly moving; as someone with lifelong anxiety, I found the idea validating and hopeful. The key, she says, is to figure out how to “tune in” to this true anxiety and hear its message. That depends on learning to sit quietly and listen to ourselves. Vora offers a simple and nonjudgmental guide to meditation, and suggests calming ourselves by getting in touch with nature and with others, since, “at the end of the day, our wellbeing rests on our connections with other people above everything else”. Vora has a medical degree from Columbia University and extensive experience in alternatives to western medicine. The result is an open-minded and well-rounded approach to the psyche. But there are a few moments – as in her discussion of psychoactive substances or eating disorders – where Vora’s judgments can appear a little too reflexively anti-orthodox, and she seems sometimes to give greater weight to individual patients’ stories than to the scientific consensus. That said, she is careful to advise readers that their own experiences are unique. “The tone of life these days is anxiety,” Vora writes. “Anxiety is the verb, the vibe, the texture, the pH of our age”. Anxious people are the proverbial canaries in the coalmine, Vora argues, sensitive to “the toxic influences of our modern world” before others identify them. Those living with the condition, then, can take pride in it; they are empathic, intuitive, creative. Anxiety “means you may have a bigger antenna than the average person, so you pick up more of the background noise,” she says. “This can be a liability, because the world can be pretty loud these days, but it’s also a gift.”  The Anatomy of Anxiety: Understanding and Overcoming the Body’s Fear Response by Dr Ellen Vora is published by Orion (£14.99).

3/25/2022,"Few singers have better mirrored the mercurial sound of dub than Horace Andy. Finding prominence with a spate of singles recorded with producer and Lee “Scratch” Perry collaborator Bunny Lee in the mid-1970s, the Jamaican singer’s vibrato-heavy falsetto has become one of dub’s defining features, as well as featuring amid the nocturnal trip-hop of Massive Attack’s albums. Over the past five decades, the legacy of Andy’s voice has reflected his music’s history. Just as the acetate of a dubplate wears with each play, giving the genre its uniquely decaying instrumental quality, so his voice has matured from the clean, high-register clarion call on breakout single Skylarking into a richer, more vulnerable tenor. His first collaboration with British dub pioneer Adrian Sherwood, Midnight Rocker is the perfect showcase for this late-career sound, revisiting a selection of Andy’s earlier material in addition to six new tracks. Sherwood artfully rearranges Andy’s originals, allowing for his vocal range to come to the fore. Sherwood darkens the sprightliness of his 1978 classic This Must Be Hell – which placed a roots vocal over jazz pianist Dave Brubeck’s Take Five refrain – by removing the jazz piano and amping up the track’s dancefloor potential with a crisp bassline and driving rhythm. Throughout, Sherwood subtly subverts the degraded spirit of dub by using studio-quality live instrumentation. This modern touch brings Andy’s vocals into high definition, in sharp contrast to the earthy pulse of rumbling bass: on their new version of 1977’s Materialist, a synth bass bolsters Andy’s yearning, crackling vibrato, giving a greater sense of urgency to his lyrics on eschewing vanity for spiritual gains; the redux of 1978’s Mr Bassie holds a journeying confidence that transforms the original’s long, melodic notes from pleading to power. New songs Watch Over Them and Try Love bring Andy into the intimate register of lover’s rock, his vocals mirroring a slow dance over the syncopated instrumentals. Sherwood coaxes some of Andy’s finest performances to date – especially on the fierce vocalisations of Safe from Harm. This potent collaboration suggests there are many more formidable dubs yet in the 71-year-old singer. Midnight Rocker is a late-career masterpiece – and who knows how he might reinterpret it in the years to come. Malian vocal star Oumou Sangaré releases her latest album Timbuktu (World Circuit), a bluesy, full-throated collection showcasing the stringed kamele n’goni. Tanzanian producer DJ Travella brings his debut record Mr Mixondo (Nyege Nyege Tapes), a blistering exposition of neon rave melodies and high-tempo singeli backbeats.

3/25/2022,"‘They grabbed our land, snatched our rice, our potatoes, our fish,” snarls a fisherman to his mates over a drink. “To take a rock in my hand and crush a soldier’s head with it, to warm my cold hands with his blood! Just to know there’s one less cockroach wandering our land. That would give me pure joy!” His friends look worried. Such careless talk costs lives. It’s Korea in 1915, but it could be anywhere oppressed peoples have chafed against imperial rule – Dublin 1916, Amritsar 1919, Nanking 1937, Mariupol 2022. When Min Jin Lee’s bestselling novel, Pachinko, was published in 2017, it was hailed as a sweeping historical epic spanning a rich era of modern east Asian history. It journeys through colonial Korea, the second world war, the allied occupation of Japan, the Korean war, to Japan’s high-growth period – all refracted through the prism of one family. Tash Aw in the Guardian praised the novel as “a rich tribute to a people that history seems intent on erasing”. He meant the so-called Zainichi – Koreans, often compelled to leave their homeland after losing their livelihoods under colonial rule and winding up uprooted, anxious second-class citizens in Japan. This adaptation brings to life a Korea you would never have gleaned from Squid Game or K-pop. It’s a vast, sumptuous, dynastic political TV series of the kind scarcely made any more, complete with swooning strings from Nico Muhly’s score. It reminds me of the historical television dramas I grew up with – Roots, Tenko, The Forsyte Saga. But there is a difference. Pachinko sophisticatedly cuts across continents and eras, from a rustic fishing village under the Japanese yoke in 1915, to braces-wearing financial workers greed-brokering deals on green computer screens in 1989 New York and Tokyo. Pachinko opens on an idyllic Korean island, blighted byJapanese officers straight out of the sadistic rotters’ playbook. “We bestow on these idiots all our progress, our schools, our education only to have a cripple spew lies in our face,” says one, on the morning after the drunken fisherman’s seditious rant. The “cripple” he is talking about is Hoonie – the kindly, cleft-lipped, hobbling father of our adorable heroine Sunja – and he won’t betray his fisherman chum to these thuggish overlords. It’s Sunja who sensibly tells our doomed rebel fisherman to clear off out of town. “I’m a man,” he tells the little girl in the opening episode’s most poignant line, “who no longer knows how to live in the world.” We cut to 1989 Osaka, where Sunja, now a beloved granny resting on the veranda, wistfully recalls this moment. The virtue of this cutting back and forth is to reinforce the sense that the drama’s Korean characters have of living under a curse. “There is a curse in my blood,” Sunja’s mother says at the outset: all three of her sons have died in their first year and, now pregnant with Sunja, she fears the girl will die too. Later our drunken fisherman worries: “It’s too much, living with this hate. Our children will be cursed. How can all this ever end?” Each such scene then flashes forward to 1989, where Sunja’s grandson, a Korean-Japanese Wall Street whizz kid called Solomon, is trying to broker a Trump-like hotel deal in Tokyo to make his fortune. He visits his family in the Korean township in Osaka. Is he, too, under the family curse? No doubt, that is why Solomon’s beloved granny tells him he is better off in the US. The problem with this narrative ride through time, though, is that it overloads us with tantalising storylines. I want to care about Solomon’s sister who has disappeared and might be dead, but here she is a mere detail flagged up for future reference. Near the end of the first episode, there is another shift in the timeline. We flash forward eight years from 1915. Sunja is now a beautiful, if impoverished, young woman, shadowed, as she strolls through her native town’s fish-gutting zone, by a strikingly handsome mysterious stranger in impeccably pressed western clothes (what kind of twerp wears a white linen suit where fish heads are flung about?) She notices she is being stared at, but he can’t keep from staring. It’s an eloquent depiction of his desire – and her intrigued disbelief that this soigné stranger desires her. Sunja doesn’t know what horrible secrets are going to be revealed about this stranger. Those of us who have read the novel, though, do: Pachinko’s curse, if that’s what it is, is poised to strike again.",Arts/Television & radio,Pachinko review – a sumptuous South Korean epic like nothing else on TV,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/25/pachinko-review-min-jin-lee-south-korea
3/25/2022,"Acollege basketball team strolled into the gym for a most unlikely practice on Tuesday – unlikely because the team was Saint Peter’s, the small school bound for the NCAA Sweet Sixteen, and because nine television cameras and nine microphones awaited. Everyone loves a Cinderella story in the NCAA Tournament, the knockout competition that ends the college basketball season and pits tiny schools like Saint Peter’s against behemoths with budgets in the tens of millions, like Duke and Kentucky. Perhaps even more so now that a horrid war is raging halfway across the world and Americans are still pretty much split into two snarling factions. The Saint Peter’s Peacocks offer a break, a getaway. All of America eats this stuff up. Saint Peter’s are just the third No15 seed in NCAA Tournament history to earn a spot in a regional final, which for the Peacocks will be this weekend in Philadelphia. They won’t be favored to go to the Final Four, let alone win a game, but they are a nice story for now. The word “surreal” was floating around a lot during a brief news conference. Doug Edert, a junior guard who grew up 10 miles away but knew nothing about Saint Peter’s until he was offered a scholarship there, smiled and said, “That’s exactly how it feels. It’s too good to describe with words.” He added, “I’m just going with the flow right now. I don’t think it’s hit me yet, what’s going on.” NCAA giantkilling stories are so compelling because they are all so different. Saint Peter’s is even better. As the crow flies, the campus is five miles from the Empire State Building but is jammed in among the lively but unglamorous clutter of Jersey City. As champion of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference, Saint Peter’s had been in three NCAA Tournaments, most recently in 2011, but the school never got much publicity. To squeeze into ESPN’s 2009 Tip-Off Marathon, the Peacocks agreed to play rival Monmouth at 6am. Saint Peter’s, a Jesuit school, has a total enrollment of about 3,000 students. Its gym is the recently renovated and renamed Run Baby Run Arena, which seats 3,200. Most of those seats were not needed, because the Peacocks averaged only 526 fans in 13 home games. By comparison, Purdue, Saint Peter’s opponent on Friday, has a total enrollment of more than 47,000 students, and the Boilermakers averaged 14,804 for their 17 home games. The Peacocks’ lineup is full of players who came to Saint Peter’s because it was the only school interested in them. The team’s best player is probably the 6ft 7in shot-blocking senior forward KC Ndefo, whose only Division I scholarship offer out of high school was from Saint Peter’s. After three productive seasons, Ndefo looked last summer into transferring to a bigger school to complete his eligibility, but none showed serious interest. So Ndefo, who was born in Nigeria and grew up in Elmont, New York, returned to Saint Peter’s two days before school started. “In the beginning, it was a little rough,” he said of his return. Ndefo had to sit out a month because he was not vaccinated. Saint Peter’s started slowly, losing six of their first nine games. Then the season was halted for four weeks because of Covid. After a 20 February loss to Siena, the Peacocks had a 12-11 record. But they are undefeated since, in large part because their fourth-year coach, Shaheen Holloway, has re-emphasized defense (although they can still duke it out with a prospect powerhouse like Kentucky, winning the first-round game in overtime, 85-79). Holloway, 45, is all but certain to leave Saint Peter’s when the season ends for a bigger school, most likely Seton Hall, where he was a feisty point guard and later an assistant coach. “I’m not worried about that,” Holloway said Tuesday. “I worry about the job I have right now. I worry about the team I have right now. I worry about what we’re doing right now. That’s the only thing that is important. Everything else, it’s just hoopla. I don’t get into rumors and that type of stuff. I focus on the mission in front of me right now, and what’s in front of me is trying to help these gentlemen accomplish their goals and dreams.” Isaiah Dasher, a senior guard who grew up in Jersey City (and played at two other colleges before coming back), said of Holloway, “It’s 24/7 with him. He means business on the court, and he’s like a brother off the court.” So what does Saint Peter’s get out of all of this? A 75-year-old college basketball lifer took a shot at that question earlier this week, saying: “What Shaheen Holloway has done, and his team, is worth tens of millions, maybe a $100m over the course of time for Saint Peter’s. It will transform an already outstanding university. It will give it more resources, more attention, more visibility. People do not understand completely what sport does for a school. It not only provides the spirit within the school, togetherness, but if you do really well it translates into visibility for everything in that university, and money.” That was Duke’s Mike Krzyzewski, who will retire this year as one of college basketball’s greatest ever coaches, speaking on his SiriusXM show. It is impossible to measure the dollar benefit of what this Saint Peter’s team have done for the university. But a gaggle of journalists from New York, New Jersey and beyond showed up at the Peacock’s practice Tuesday. So did the New Jersey governor, Phil Murphy. Run Baby Run Arena is named for the undersized but fast 1968 Saint Peter’s basketball team, who won 24 games and beat Duke in the National Invitation Tournament. A photo and bio of each player is in the lobby of the revitalized arena. All were from the New York area. This Saint Peter’s team includes players from the Central African Republic, Mali and Senegal, so the word has spread. But the Peacocks are still the little guys who have a shot to topple more big guys, and that story never gets old – and definitely not now. “Honestly, it’s crazy, you know, God is good,” Ndefo said. “God puts opportunities out for people and, you know, I just try to stay the course and be grateful for what is going on because anything could have happened.”",Sport/Sport,Saint Peter’s: the tiny college taking on basketball giants and winning,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/25/saint-peters-the-tiny-college-taking-on-basketball-giants-and-winning
3/25/2022,"As a rapper, Machine Gun Kelly once vied for Eminem’s crown. However, his Hot Topic aesthetic and take on rock-rap always felt more suited to a spot on the Warped tour. It made his reboot to pop-punk star on 2020’s Tickets to My Downfall – facilitated by Blink-182 drummer and genre revivalist Travis Barker – feel as inevitable as his subsequent tabloid-baiting romance with actor Megan Fox: the pair allegedly drank each other’s blood when they got engaged. Unhinged rockstar relationships and heightened celebrity have clearly shaped Mainstream Sellout. The songs about infatuation are most entertaining: the energetic guitars and yelped vocals on devotional Emo Girl feel lifted from a 2000s teen flick; the poppier Post Malone stylings of Make Up Sex houses the album’s best (albeit lyrically uninspired) chorus; and bewildering Lil Wayne collaboration Drug Dealer, hopefully a metaphor for the addictive power of love, is so melodically enticing that you can overlook its abject absurdity. A reliance on cliches sours things. “I’m fucked up,” Kelly sings on God Save Me; “Don’t belong / I’m a punk,” he moans on Papercuts. Coming from a 31-year-old, it’s embarrassing. It’s better when the aim is Hollywood insincerity, like the title track’s wry dismissal of genre gatekeeping, or the breezy Fake Love Don’t Last’s warning to wannabe influencers (“I want you to know you can’t come back”). It’s all well-trodden stuff, and Kelly adds nothing new, but Mainstream Sellout is so much fun that – as the title suggests – it’s easy to leave your integrity behind and mosh along.",Arts/Music,"Machine Gun Kelly: Mainstream Sellout review – fun, fresh outta-the-00s punk-pop",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/25/machine-gun-kelly-mainstream-sellout-review-absurd-cliches-fun
3/25/2022,"Riding a motorbike in Uganda was something only men could do. At least that is what Allen Kisakye Butundu was told when she said she wanted to learn to ride one. “The community were shocked to see a female rider. Some people would even shout things at me and chase me,” she says. The 27-year-old decided to learn to ride a motorbike two years ago. Initially, the decision was to save money on travel between the capital, Kampala, and the more rural areas where she worked as a social worker. But she is now one of just a few female riders of boda boda, as motorbike taxis are known, out of an estimated 1 million in Uganda. She is also one of only three women working for SafeBoda, a Uganda-based startup that employs about 26,000 riders. Butundu earns up to £10 a day on her motorbike and is the chief breadwinner for her children and husband, a trained veterinarian, who has regular periods without work. But the journey has not been easy in a society with engrained gender roles. Her husband “refused completely” when she asked him to teach her how to ride. “I didn’t give up,” she says. “I stopped boda boda drivers on the road and said: ‘I’m not a customer but I want to learn how to ride this bike, I want to do your business.’” Butundu was taught by other riders, paying them a small fee or buying petrol. Her husband eventually came around to her new passion and paid the deposit on a £1,400 bike. Last year, she became a full-time driver. Working from about 10am to 6pm most days, Butundu says she decided to forgo her former career because she could be more flexible with her hours. She has recently bought another bike and rents one out to a friend. She found it difficult to adapt to being a boda boda driver, though. “My neighbours had never seen me put on trousers before. I felt ashamed at first,” she says. “I used to pack my helmet and trousers in a bag and change near my bike, which I parked away from the house. But then I thought – I have to start accepting that this is part of my work.” Butundu’s parents still do not know about her job, and her sister was shocked: “She didn’t believe I was her biological sister.” Driving a boda boda is considered taboo for women because of its association with crime. It is a largely unregulated industry and in February, Ugandan authorities warned that criminals were masquerading as boda boda drivers. Women are also seen as unable to defend themselves from attacks from other drivers and the public. One of Butundu’s passengers stole her phone when he realised she was a woman. But being a woman can have benefits, she says. Riders are constantly trying to evade police officers in central Kampala as they weave in and out of heavy traffic. This often leads to the police seizing bikes and forcing drivers to pay large fines. “But when they notice I am a woman, instead of being tough, they start smiling and they let me go,” she laughs. Butundu hopes her story will encourage other women to start riding boda boda in Uganda. She praises her employer, saying the startup is working to restore faith in the industry by training its drivers, ensuring they wear helmets and tracking their movements through an app. But the company has only scratched the surface – only about half of the country’s boda boda drivers are registered, according to officials. Butundu will keep on breaking gender boundaries. “Those who talk, let them talk,” she laughs. “This woman is serious now.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,‘My husband refused to teach me’: the taxi bike rider breaking Uganda’s taboos ,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/25/my-husband-refused-to-teach-me-the-taxi-bike-rider-breaking-ugandas-taboos
3/25/2022,"It wasn’t supposed to go like this. Usually, royal tours are full of cheering people lining the streets and gushy accounts of glamorous dresses. There has been some of that during the royal visit by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to the Caribbean. But there also have been protests, especially in Jamaica, where many people want the royal family to apologise for its role in institutionalising slavery on the island. To top it all off, it has also been reported this week that Jamaica has begun the process of removing the Queen as the head of state. Such a reckoning with Britain and its state is long overdue. Jamaica in the 18th century was described by Charles Leslie as a “constant mine, whence Britain draws prodigious riches”. It contributed greatly to the wealth of individuals thousands of miles away, such as William Beckford, Lord Mayor of London and the owner of well over 1,000 enslaved people, whose statue still graces Guildhall in London. But more significantly, it enriched Britain by filling the coffers of the Treasury with money from taxes levied on sugar and rum. Britain was the greatest slave trader in the Atlantic world during the 18th century, sending nearly 1 million captive Africans to Jamaica between 1655 and 1807, resulting in a population of enslaved people barely over 300,000, due to horrific mortality rates. Black people suffered greatly for white people’s enjoyment of sweet things. Kingston, where the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited, is the Ellis Island of forced migration to places that were colonised by the British in the 17th and 18th centuries. More Africans arrived in Kingston to become plantation slaves than arrived in any other place in the British empire. The visiting royals might have acknowledged this fact by visiting the foreshore and noting the trauma for Jamaicans, most of whom are descendants of those people arriving from Africa some centuries back, rather than kicking a football around and playing bongos in Trench Town. If they had done so they might realise why many Jamaicans are so angry at their visit. The royal family has a long and undistinguished history in regard to Jamaican slavery. In the 17th century Charles II granted a charter to the Royal African Company and his brother, James II, would later become its governor. Under royal blessing, the company became the largest single slave trader in British history, bringing perhaps 100,000 captive Africans to the Americas before 1713. George II was a prominent supporter of the slave trade and plantations. George III as a young man is said to have expressed antislavery sentiments before he became king, but he did little to stop the slave trade or slavery during his long reign. Some royals, such as the Duke of Gloucester, supported William Wilberforce in his campaign against slavery. But most of the royal family – George III and his many sons – supported slavery and West Indian planters, with seven royal dukes in favour of slavery against one against during debates on abolishing the slave trade heard in the House of Lords. Indeed, William, the Duke of Clarence (later William IV), was a leader of the pro-slavery lobby, being given a gift of expensive silver dinner ware (still in the royal family’s possession), by the Jamaican assembly for his efforts against closing down the slave trade. Consequently, we can understand why many Jamaicans who are descendants of enslaved Africans feel the royal family have to answer for their past behaviour and attitudes. As far as I’m concerned, they need to do more than just apologise on behalf of Britain; they might acknowledge their own responsibility – moral and even financial – as a family enmeshed in multiple ways in supporting slavery. Prince William rightly condemned slavery in a speech at a state dinner on Wednesday evening as “an appalling atrocity” that “forever stains our history”. But he did not take the necessary next step and note that it is more than just something bad that Britain did. It is an atrocity for which the royal family itself has a degree of personal responsibility. Of course, we could argue that Britain has acknowledged its liabilities as a slave-holding nation by the fact that it paid what was then the enormous sum of £20m pounds in 1834 as compensation for slavery. Some of that money ended up being invested in developing Jamaican infrastructure, such as banks, insurance agencies and railways. The problem is that it all went to slaveholders, those people who had kept Black Jamaicans in misery. Britain gave money to slaveholders as a means of ensuring the abolition of slavery would occur. It was very worried that without such compensation, white planters would refuse to give up their enslaved property, which would lead to the island and its plantation colony being destroyed in ways that Britons had seen happening a generation before, in Haiti. The British government gave nothing to the enslaved people who produced the wealth for which Jamaica used to be famous. Now, Jamaica is a poor country. It would be a good thing if Britain recognised its historical responsibility for creating those conditions of poverty, while benefiting from Jamaican wealth. It might start with the royal family recognising its role in supporting this terrible institution.
