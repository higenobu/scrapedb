4/12/2022,"The poster for Women of the White Buffalo, a documentary about the Lakota people and their history, comes from a portrait that director Deborah Anderson took to raise awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls (MMIWG). The photo features a Lakota woman, Delacina Chief Eagle, looking directly at the camera with wounded eyes, her hair disheveled, a feather hanging off to one side and a red handprint representing MMIWG smudged across her mouth. That image, which was originally on display at the Beverly Hills Leica Gallery alongside other portraits, is loaded, leaning into tropes regularly used for settler consumption over the past century. Chief Eagle, a survivor of rape and abuse, is modelled to look the stoic Native wearing recognizable Indigenous iconography, from the feather to the handprint worn like war paint. The photo is provocative in a way that also serves its purpose. It’s safe to assume the audience at the Leica Gallery weren’t all that aware of the violence directed at Indigenous women and the myriad ways that they are silenced until coming face-to-face with those portraits of Lakota women. Indigenous women in the US are murdered at a rate up to 10 times higher than the national average. Anderson admits to being clueless about these issues too before embarking on the documentary, which acts as an accompanying explainer to those images by covering 530 years of genocide as told through the history of the Lakota people. “I really didn’t recognize the enormity of this project until I threw myself into it,” Anderson told the Guardian over a Zoom call from her home in upstate New York. Early on in our conversation, Anderson makes it clear she is not Lakota, recognizing that authorship when telling Indigenous stories is a contentious matter. She was raised in the Caribbean and schooled in Britain. Her father is the singer Jon Anderson, frontman for the band Yes. Her ethnicity is Scottish, Irish and West Indian. She hasn’t done a DNA test to verify the Black and Indigenous makeup of her West Indian ancestry, but she assumes there’s some component of Arawak, Taino and/or Carib-Indian. She explains her rather circuitous journey to telling this story, which began with eavesdropping on photographers at a Palm Springs camera store as they discussed shooting wild horses and buffalo on a reservation. Her curiosity about life on a reservation was piqued. So Anderson, who had mostly been shooting ad campaigns for fashion brands and working with celebrities, went home and Googled “Native American Indian Women”. “What came back was so horrifying to me,” says Anderson. “The missing and murdered Indigenous women; the lack of understanding around why these women were going missing; and that nobody was really doing anything about it. And then I started to see these images of how these Natives were living. And that was it. I just knew that that was what I was meant to do.” Women of the White Buffalo broadly recaps the US genocide of Indigenous peoples through broken treaties, buffalo slaughter and boarding schools, where remains of children are being excavated. The film then illustrates the ways that genocide continues today on reservations like Pine Ridge and Rosebud in South Dakota, through addiction, suicide and victimization, as fossil fuel pipelines bring pollution and oil workers to Indigenous reservations. Just last month, the US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez presented the correlation between ”man camps” set up for fossil fuel extraction and the violence committed against Indigenous women. “You don’t realize the domino effect,” says Anderson. “That’s really what I’m praying this film will gift people: an understanding of history and how one thing affects another.” Anderson is far from the first to make a film at Pine Ridge. The reservation is one of the poorest places in the United States. And its proximity to Wounded Knee, the site of a massacre in 1890 and a standoff with the FBI in 1972, makes it a draw for news cameras and film-makers, the most prolific being the Oscar winner Chloé Zhao. The Nomadland and Eternals director made her first two features, Songs My Brothers Taught Me and The Rider, at Pine Ridge. According to Lakota film-maker Razelle Benally, despite its contentious history, Pine Ridge is “a welcoming tribe”. “I think it’s easy to come to Pine Ridge purely to extract stories out of the people,” Benally told the Guardian on a Zoom call. “We have a history where we’ve been silenced. We’re impoverished. We have issues with drug addiction, alcohol abuse and abuse in general. And obviously those issues come from colonization. So if given a chance, any chance, to speak out, we will generally take it because it’s a chance to be heard.” Benally, an MFA candidate at NYU who has directed a number of shorts, expressed a weariness over film-makers who are not from the community telling the story of Lakota people. Her apprehension is generally shared across the Indigenous film-making community in the US and Canada. Films already have a long and fraught history of misrepresenting Indigenous communities, portraying them as savage to justify a genocide. That misrepresentation goes all the way back to early westerns and Robert Flaherty’s 100-year-old manipulated documentary Nanook of the North. Today, the ambivalence could be directed towards settler film-makers who lean on tropes or dwell on Indigenous trauma to prop up white savior narratives. Think Taylor Sheridan’s Wind River, which casts Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen as the heroes in an MMIW narrative. “There’s a savior-ist aspect to extractive film-making,” says Benally. “Now everybody wants to save the Indian and [tell] our story because it’s evocative or they think that they’re discovering or uncovering more about us, when we’ve been living with the effects of colonization this entire time.” Benally, who had not yet viewed Women of the White Buffalo when we spoke, describes a tendency among film-makers to fetishize Indigenous struggle or poverty. She adds that Chloé Zhao did something different by romanticizing the Indigenous struggle in her two features. “Was it an authentic Lakota lens? No. Her films can be deemed extractive too, because she used a community outside of her own to serve her career.” There’s connective tissue between film-makers arriving on a reservation to extract Indigenous stories and settlers arriving on Indigenous lands to take resources. But there’s also a history of films that raise crucial awareness, like Michael Apted’s 1992 documentary Incident at Oglala, which shed light on a miscarriage of justice at Pine Ridge. The difference between then and now is that there are more Indigenous film-makers finding the opportunities to tell their own stories. “I think there’s a lot of Indigenous people right now that are really stepping up and taking matters into our own hands and showing the world that we’re capable,” says Benally, referring to a healthy global Indigenous film-making community led by Taika Waititi, Sterlin Harjo and Danis Goulet. “When we have people doing these films for us, it infantilizes us, as if we can’t do things ourselves, which we clearly can.” Anderson says she’s a big fan of Harjo’s Reservation Dogs, a cheeky dramatic comedy about rez life. She adds that she got all the inside jokes in a series that’s loaded with specificity after spending four years with the communities at Pine Ridge and Rosebud. “I really created this film with them,” says Anderson. She explains that she was warmly invited into the community by the late elder Carol Iron Rope Herrera. She adds that Herrera was eager for a platform to speak to what was going on before she died. Herrera appears in Women of the White Buffalo along with several other Lakota women whom she introduced to Anderson. “I speak with them constantly, still,” says Anderson. “I have a very close relationship with most of the women because I wanted that. It wasn’t just coming in and taking a story. I wanted to make sure I did it the right way from the beginning. There was no like, ‘I’m coming in and then this is my version of your story.’ It’s their version of their story. And I was just asked to hold those stories in the right way and put it together in a tangible, palatable experience by way of the film.” Women of the White Buffalo is now available to rent digitally in the US with a UK date to be announced",Arts/Film,"‘If given a chance to speak, we’ll take it’: inside the lives of Native American women",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/12/native-american-women-of-the-white-buffalo-documentary
4/12/2022,"Australia’s jobs rebound since the Covid recession has been a big part of the Coalition’s re-election pitch. On Tuesday the Morrison government committed “to create 1.3 million new jobs over the next five years”, on top of the “1.9 million new jobs” created since the Coalition was elected in 2013. But what does it mean for the government to claim it “created” jobs, and is the “future jobs” pledge meaningful? In September 2013 the number of employed people in Australia was 11,477,300, in seasonally adjusted terms, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. In February 2022, the latest labour force release, the number of employed people was 13,372,000. The difference between those is the source of the 1.9m jobs created claim. In that time, unemployment has declined from 5.7% to 4%. The participation rate also improved from 64.8% to 66.4%. Prof Jeff Borland, a labour economist at the University of Melbourne, said the first qualification on the jobs boast is that “the government doesn’t create those jobs”. “The government creates some jobs in the public sector and by funding particular activities in the private sector,” he said. “But it’s the overall economic environment that determines job creation, which the government only influences. “They shouldn’t be held entirely responsible nor given all the credit for whatever growth there is.” On Tuesday, the finance minister, Simon Birmingham said the employment results were “driven in part by our investments … in infrastructure, our support for small businesses … our modern manufacturing strategy”. “These things don’t just happen by accident. It matters who people vote for.” The next thing to note is although jobs are up since 2013, Australia is also a much bigger country. In September 2013 the population was 23.2 million, but in February 2022 it was 25.9 million, an increase of 2.7 million people. Matt Grudnoff, a senior economist at progressive thinktank the Australia Institute, said the biggest factor behind jobs growth is “basically just population growth”. With respect to the future target, Grudnoff calculated that if the average growth in the labour force in the last seven years continues for another five, 1.25 million more people will be in work or looking for work. With an unemployment rate of 4%, the 1.3m jobs pledge is 100,000 more people in work than would be expected. Borland agreed, calculating that jobs growth had averaged about 220,000 a year over the last decade, meaning over the next five years jobs growth “would be about 1.1m anyway”. Once the effects of the pandemic over the last two years are excluded, Grudnoff projected the labour force would grow by 1.5m, meaning that adding just 1.3m jobs “would actually increase” the unemployment rate. “[The pledge is] not significant,” Grudnoff said. “The only way it wouldn’t happen is if there is a big recession. “The economy would be expected to generate that regardless of who is in power. “It’s like saying there is record funding in health or education, but that is true because of the population increasing and inflation – it sounds impressive but it is entirely meaningless.” Borland said: “It’s a one-day attempt at a headline … It’s rolled out at every election, but it’s not meaningful as an economic target.” Borland said absolute jobs growth is the “wrong target” because “what we actually care about the is proportion of the population in employment, or in the labour force who are able to get employment”. “It would be much more meaningful to say: we are committed to keeping unemployment below 4%.” Borland said for much of the last decade unemployment had “meandered along at 5.5%” and Australia’s performance on that metric was “nothing sensational”. According to the budget papers, Australia’s unemployment is forecast to fall to 3.75% from 2022-23 to 2024-25, before rising back to 4% in 2025-26. In the 2019 election campaign the Coalition promised 1.25m more jobs. This pledge was not fulfilled. In May 2019 there were 12,858,700 employed people in Australia, meaning just 513,300 jobs have been added in the last term of government. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Birmingham explained on Tuesday that Australia had “lived through a global pandemic” and averted the “loss of 700,000 jobs” through the jobkeeper wage subsidy. The Australian economy had 370,000 more jobs after Covid than before, he told ABC Radio National. Australia’s economic recovery from the Covid recession has been impressive, and this is reflected in high labour force participation and low unemployment. Nothing meaningful is added to these measures by saying 1.9m jobs have been created since 2019 or 1.3m will be created in the next five years.",News/Australia news,Factcheck: did the Coalition create 1.9 million jobs? Will it create 1.3 million more?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/12/factcheck-did-the-coalition-create-19-million-jobs-will-it-create-13-million-more
4/12/2022,"At least 40% of child-to-parent violence and abuse incidents are unreported to police, according to research. The study into the “hidden harm” commissioned by the London mayor’s Violence Reduction Unit (VRU) found that the rate of violence and abuse against parents and carers was highest among those aged 19-25, and 81% of perpetrators were male. It found that 89% of victims of recorded incidents such as attacks, coercive control, financial abuse, threats, intimidation and harassment were a parent of the accused. Experts said figures were probably greater than those reported, and were expected to rise. The research, by the independent consultancy Ecorys, comes after a campaign launched by the mayor last month highlighting the importance of tackling misogyny as a cause of violence against women and girls. The abuse between adolescents and parents or carers is gendered too: research found that the majority of known cases took place between adolescent boys and their mothers. Violence and abuse inflicted by young women and girls appears to receive a different response and intervention, research found. Figures reveal that while the number of incidents peaked in 2018, they fell in subsequent years. Only during the first national Covid-19 lockdown in 2020, which exacerbated abusive and violent situations in the UK and internationally, did incidents begin rising slightly. The research shows that more than two-thirds of the victims were female, and most victims were between the ages of 40 and 54. Drawing on data from 2011-20, the research found that while there was no single cause of child-to-parent violence and abuse, the issue was often underreported to police due to fears of criminalisation, stigmatisation or the risk of having a child removed from homes. Other factors include cultural and linguistic barriers, and a mistrust of services resulting in patchwork support and resources for families. One woman included in the report said she felt hopeless: “At one point I called the police and … I saw the police coming and taking my son out of the flat and the other kids were watching. When my son came back, he said, ‘You called the police on your own son.’ That just damaged the relationship.” In another example, a woman who had been a victim of intimate violence from her previous partner, was not supported by her family when her child became abusive. Her family blamed her for “not being hard enough” on her children. The analysis adds that while cases occur in families across various communities, ethnicities and socioeconomic status, people from ethnic minorities were overrepresented when compared with the population of London and England. Without its own legal definition, child or adolescent to parent violence and abuse (CAPVA) is understood as a form of domestic abuse in cases involving young people over the age of 16, meaning those under 16 are at times treated as adult perpetrators. “It’s crucial we have a joined-up approach to tackling this issue,” said the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. “I want all Londoners, including parents and carers, to have confidence in reporting concerns so that services can intervene much earlier and provide the support families need and deserve.”",News/Society,"At least 40% of child-to-parent violence in UK unreported, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/12/at-least-40-of-child-to-parent-violence-in-uk-unreported-study-finds
4/12/2022,"The convulsions of the 1980s – a decade of excess and agitation and collapse – reached the unlikeliest quarters. While other parts of the world dealt with revolution and meltdown, the mean streets of literary London were also in ferment. If you assumed the world of books to be a tiny backwater, John Walsh is here to make you think again. Circus of Dreams – no skimping on the grandeur there – recounts a brief period when publishing almost became bold and writers became almost famous. Books suddenly infiltrated the news pages via awards (a bolstered Booker prize) and marketing gimmicks. A major new book chain (Waterstones) appeared in the high street. A whizzy new members’ club (the Groucho) opened in Soho, the improbable brainchild of a bunch of publishers. Occupying a ringside seat at the “circus” is Walsh, writer, broadcaster and, we must now add, illusionist. For if anyone has managed to conjure the impression of a mountain from a molehill it is he. His previous book, Are You Talking to Me?, was a droll memoir of a film-obsessed youth honing his mastery of the self-deprecating anecdote. This new one picks up the story in his early 20s when, an aspiring littérateur, he begins as dogsbody in a London publishing house Gollancz, just as its star was in decline. No matter. Surrounded by clever women and randy for attention, the young Walsh gets a toehold in this fusty-looking milieu and begins plotting his ascent to the top – ie literary editor of the Times by the age of 35. Well, what’s a heaven for? His most attractive quality – this has a general application in life – is enthusiasm. His passion for the novels of Martin Amis and the poetry of Craig Raine is touchingly eager, while his appetite for socialising has a Boswellian bumptiousness. He knows this is not a profession for the wallflower. That said, he could do with cooling his prose at times. “Tina Brown hit the journalistic empyrean like a sleek blonde rocket” is a bit try-hard, so too his judgment on Angela Carter’s work - “like finding a clump of Venus flytraps in the agreeable bluebell wood of English prose”. These campy flourishes are like drum solos: a little goes a long way. After a brief misstep into business journalism he grabs a berth on Books and Bookmen magazine and embraces the Grub Street routine of reviewing, interviewing, party-going. Yes, bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, but to read books for your bread was very heaven. I know this because in the late 1980s I was making my own lowly way into the trade, thrilled at the idea of the freelance life. (I still have the lit ed’s letter commissioning my first book review for the Independent.) So Circus of Dreams should be catnip to me – and possibly about five other people. For what general reader could be interested in stories from this subculture, rarefied at the time, utterly inconsequential today? So much of it depends on Walsh raiding his cuttings file for material. I could take another interview with hero Amis, or a boozy night with Graham Swift, but a four-page review of Rushdie’s Midnight’s Children is beyond sufferance. At times, the self-involvement is Pooterish. An interview with William Trevor down in Devon (“the train ride to Exeter took two hours”) extends into lunch with the author and his wife (“delicious roast lamb… parsnips from the garden”) and concludes with a wistful reflection on why he can’t, like Trevor, turn his experience into “spectacular fiction”. Would this book have worked as a novel? Maybe. At least then we might have felt that something was at stake. As it is, Walsh has no distance from his subjects. Once he’s anointed as the Times literary editor (Sunday version) he gets down to serious hobnobbing with the big literary beasts. Launch parties are recalled in lists of celebrity attendees, “et moi”, he adds, just in case we’d forgotten he was there too. You note how often he refers to a writer as a “genius” (JG Ballard, Rushdie, C Northcote Parkinson) or a “great man” (Seamus Heaney, Anthony Burgess, George Barker et al). George Steiner, described only as an “alarmingly brilliant man”, may have felt hard done by. In the chapter Launches, Lunches and Lechery, I thought Walsh was going to out himself as a “swordsman of the boudoir”, as he styles one opportunist pouncer of his acquaintance, but he remains coy on the matter. He seems about to do so a second time when speculating on the real-life counterpart of Ivo Sponge, a priapic literary editor in Amanda Craig’s novel A Vicious Circle, famous for “the Sponge Lunge”, but again he veers away from self-incrimination. He can be very funny and I laughed long at the set-piece lunch with Amis (again) when he over-orders on the vegetables and likens his steaming plate to “a Crimean war field kitchen”. His character sketch of his ex-boss Rupert Murdoch is similarly inspired, the old man’s face with its many tics and moues resembling “one of those Popperfoto contact sheets, depicting the complete range of expressions available to mortal beings”. He’s a good observer when the mood suits him. Alas, his book can’t escape the impression of secondhand stock. The story of [radio presenter] Frank Delaney’s hook-up with Princess Margaret, like much else here, is velvet worn to baldness by overuse. While you couldn’t wish the book were longer, it’s quite surprising that Walsh omits to mention one of the stories most illustrative of the book world’s nutty excess in the 1980s. A mainstream publisher was preparing an offer for a renowned historian’s three-volume whopper on the 20th century (or something) when it received by fax a letter from his agent: they wanted £500,000 for the three books. The fax, handwritten, was mulled over at HQ and eventually the publisher agreed to pay £900,000, in instalments. Huh? A “5” had been misread for a “9”, so the author pocketed an extra 400 grand for nowt. Circus of Dreams? Send in the clowns.

4/12/2022,"It was a sunny Saturday and my first experience of calories on menus. I can now tell you that prawns are low in calories, chorizo is high , and salt and pepper squid is surprisingly energy-rich – though this is not surprising to me because I am a woman of a certain vintage, and we can all tell you how many calories are in absolutely everything, so long as it was in common usage by 1985, in other words, not seitan. The calories in/calories out model – the fitness industry now calls calorie counting “If It Fits Your Macros”, which conveys something huge about modern life – tyrannised my youth. Even if you pretended not to care, or actually didn’t care, you could still rate any given food item at 50 paces. You could name everything that looked healthy but was highly calorific, everything that was more or less calorie neutral, all the miracle foods that did high satiety for low energy load, all the foods that were discreetly low calorie (cottage cheese was so obvious). There were so many numbers and properties all neatly filed away in millions of brains. I hate to think how much other, more useful information was displaced by this nerdy, self-hating food-spotting, though I have a fair idea. Years later, I used to do a quiz for hen nights with one round called The Wonderful World of Men; you had to point north, throw a ball of paper into a bin, correctly identify a Sten gun and down a can of Foster’s under timed conditions. All of those skills had been lost by a generation fixated on getting to the bottom of whether or not celery took more calories to digest than it delivered to the body. Anyway, at some point in the intervening million years, people started to ask, if this was so damn simple, and all you had to do was use more energy than you ate, why didn’t calorie counting work? In quiet corners of the world, ignoring the cacophony of “it’s all about willpower, stupid”, scientists working on the obese mouse model discovered the hormone leptin, which led to a much deeper understanding of appetite and lethargy. First meal out since calories on menus… and ohhhhh boy 😬 pic.twitter.com/AhaDE9xIjB A clearer picture also emerged of the role of protein, and the relative hormonal impacts of glucose and fructose. For brevity, your body doesn’t care about your bookkeeping, your appetite doesn’t care whether you’re beach-ready, and the main driver of obesity is not your pathetic lack of backbone, but rather, food manufacturing processes that add a load of sugar to everything for the purposes of longer shelf life. If that completely upends your natural ability to regulate your intake, well, so be it and ker-ching! So, I want to say that this government initiative of printing calories on menus is a pointless move that will have no impact. Yet, that’s not quite true – it is disastrous for people with eating disorders, who are already working full tilt to overcome their anxiety just by coming to the restaurant, and are now confronted with a system that reinforces calorie fixation and creates a sense that their every choice is exposed and scrutinised. It is quite a useful insight into just how bad policy can be, when it’s not interested in the problem, only in appearing to be interested. While I was choosing prawns and chorizo and salt and pepper squid, because I genuinely don’t care, the broadcaster Sophy Ridge was sharing a menu on Twitter, where the calorie counts were head-spinning: pork belly came in at 2,500, a side of cauliflower cheese at nearly 500; you could only energy-neutralise this meal with 10 solid hours of weight training, and you would still have change for a Wordle (another youth fixation: exactly how many calories were used by thinking). A theory: restaurants, knowing this new rule is stupid, are subverting it by rounding up, to create a world in which you either have to go home, or stop caring. Hospitality is smart and imaginative, in piquant contrast to the rules that govern it.

4/12/2022,"While hundreds of Hackney horses once elegantly clip-clopped around London pulling carriages, the breed is now dying out because that mode of transport is no longer used. The Rare Breeds Survival Trust (RBST) annual watchlist has highlighted the breed as at risk because there are just 31 breeding females left in the UK. Native goat breeds, however, are doing particularly well and have even become a popular pet. Farmers are also trialling older English goat breeds for a more sustainable way to produce milk and meat. Each year, conservationists behind the RBST Watchlist track the number of animals in each native breed. They focus on ensuring the future of domestic breeds, pointing out that many of these are now part of the country’s landscape and important for biodiversity. Hackney horse numbers have fallen below 50, which is set as a threshold for concern by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. The breed, which already had very low numbers, has seen further decline over the past year, with just 31 females producing registered progeny from only 12 breeders. This compares with more than 300 breeding females registered in 2011. Christopher Price, the chief executive of RBST, said: “Unlike many of our native equines they don’t have a contemporary use – many [other breeds] can be used in forestry work and that sort of thing. For most, carriage-pulling is more of a hobby. People should keep them because they are part of our biodiversity, part of our history. “The UN charter of biodiversity imposes a need to sustain both native and kept breeds. Farmed and wild animals have an equal conservation imperative. We can sustain this population but far better if we can get more people keeping, using and registering them.” However, Price was keen to note that many breeds of cattle and goat were thriving because of the changing nature of farming. While in recent decades continental breeds, which grow to huge sizes when given supplementary feed and warm housing, have been the norm, native breeds that need less food and warmth to thrive are becoming more popular. Although there is an “element of pets and novelty” in keeping goat breeds including Old English, Bagot and Guernsey, many are being kept for their meat and milk by farmers because they need little food and shelter. Price explained: “As farming is changing with subsidies going, they are surviving by diversifying and creating a niche product. It’s hard to keep high-input breeds with subsidies going and people are looking more for low-input species. And goats are pretty low-input as they don’t need all the supplementary feed and vet bills that many continental breeds need. Our native breeds were bred to thrive in farming systems that we had at the start of the century – more low environmental impact and low input.” Other breeds doing well include Dartmoor and Exmoor ponies, which are becoming popular for use in rewilding projects, as well as native species of cattle. Animals at risk Large White pigs: Large White pigs are moving to the highest priority level on the watchlist. The breed used to be hugely popular and was used to develop lots of commercial breeds. According to the British Pig Association, almost every pork joint in the supermarket today will have some degree of Large White in its genetic makeup. In 1954 the number of licensed boars recorded was 16,751, which represented 76% of the total male pig population. Data from the BPA shows just 66 boars recorded in 2021. Hackney horse and pony: these horses and ponies were once highly sought-after for pulling carriages. Norfolk Horn sheep: One of the oldest of the UK’s sheep breeds, by the 1890s there was just one flock left. Numbers are now healthier but the significant decline this year in numbers of breeding dams and progeny is very worrying. Gloucester cattle: Gloucester cattle remain a major concern with a decline in the number of dams exacerbating concerns about lack of genetic diversity and geographic distribution. Improving fortunes Native breed goats: with goats becoming increasingly popular to keep, the UK’s four native breeds (English, Old English, Bagot and Guernsey) have all had a year of stability or growth. Lincoln Longwool sheep – the breed remains in the priority category but there has been an increase in effective population size and number of breeders. Exmoor and Dartmoor ponies – the West Country breeds have seen an important increase in the number of dams, which is crucial to managing inbreeding. Vaynol and Albion cattle – both remain priority breeds, but their numbers saw significant improvements in 2021.",News/Environment,Hackney horses at risk but native goats thriving in the UK,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/12/hackney-horses-at-risk-but-native-goats-thriving-in-the-uk
4/12/2022,"A majority of Highland estates that changed hands last year were sold in secret, and nearly half went to absentee owners rushing to buy rural land for environmental reasons, a report has revealed. The Scottish Land Commission, an official body set up to reform land ownership, has warned these trends are threatening attempts to diversify land ownership, improve the rural economy and increase transparency and accountability. An investigation it commissioned implies the Scottish land market is at risk of overheating, with the demand from corporations, charities and the privately wealthy for prime Highland estates greatly outstripping supply. A study by Scotland’s Rural College and two major estate agencies – Savills and Strutt & Parker – has for the first time analysed land sales in Scotland over the past two years involving Highland sporting estates, commercial forests and farms. It found that prices for sporting estates jumped by 88% in 2021 compared with 2020, even though the number of properties sold was similar to the five-year average. Two sold for more than £20m. And despite the global pandemic, the amount spent last year rose by 119% compared with 2020. Nearly two-thirds of last year’s sales were carried out privately, without the land going on the open market, with a third of the total going to overseas buyers. Those “off market” sales meant land was changing hands secretly without allowing local people to put in bids, the commission warned. Hamish Trench, the commission’s chief executive, said these trends could make it “significantly harder” for local communities, cooperatives and social enterprises to buy land, stifling efforts to promote rural economic diversity. That greatly increased the case for new public interest tests to be introduced on large land sales, and for rules to prevent private land sales excluding local communities, he added. “The way the land market functions is important to Scotland’s ambitions such as net zero, nature restoration, repopulation and community empowerment,” Trench said. “Being able to participate in the market shapes not just who owns Scotland’s land, but who is able to make decisions and who benefits from land and its economic, social and environmental value.” Businesses and investors are now paying premium prices for rural estates, commercial forests and farms to offset carbon emissions and sell green investments as they attempt to meet the challenges set by governments and scientists to address climate heating. At the same time, the very wealthy are still buying Highland estates for lifestyle reasons but are now investing much more in woodland, rewilding and peatland restoration rather than focusing on deer stalking, salmon and grouse as before. A recent study by Community Land Scotland, which campaigns for land reform, found that many forestry projects are subsidised by government grants to promote reforestation and regeneration, while also allowing owners to sell carbon credits based on the CO2 the forests absorb. That has meant farm prices in Scotland jumped by 31% last year, compared with 6% at UK level, the land commission report said. The value of poor-quality grazing land and hill farms ideal for forestry rose by 60% last year. The commission’s findings will intensify pressure on the Scottish government to introduce a public interest test and potentially limit the amount of land one individual or entity can own. As part of the Scottish National party’s cooperation deal with the Scottish Greens it plans to introduce a new land reform bill in late 2023, but it remains unclear what ministers intend to do. The government has also promised to double the £10m-a-year Scottish Land Fund, which distributes grants for community buyouts, to £20m by 2026. That fund was already heavily oversubscribed before last year’s sudden surge in land prices, and had to turn applicants away. In 2019, the commission found that about 1,125 owners, including public bodies and charities, owned 70% of Scotland’s rural land, totalling 4.1m hectares (10m acres). That includes 87 owners who hold 1.7m hectares, including some that own vast landholdings of over 80,000 hectares spreading over multiple properties. The Scottish government said it recognised the case for land reform. The commission’s report supported “the approach we are taking to ensure that the investment in our natural capital is conducted in a responsible manner, in keeping with our land reform objectives and the need to ensure a just transition to net zero.” Calum MacLeod, the policy director of Community Land Scotland, said the government’s timetable lacked urgency. It could take several years for legislation to come into force. “Scotland urgently needs land reform legislation regulating ‘off-market’ estate sales, applying public interest tests on significant land transfers and current landholdings, and making it easier to use existing community rights to buy land to be enacted well before the end of 2023,” he said.",News/UK news,Majority of sales of Highland estates conducted in secret,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/12/majority-of-sales-of-highland-estates-conducted-in-secret-scotland

4/12/2022,"The latest high-end smartphone from OnePlus is a top-spec device with a good combination of aesthetics and performance, and a price that undercuts rivals. Just don’t sit on it. The 10 Pro costs from £799 ($899), which is still premium priced but £30 cheaper than last year’s model and £250 less than the parent company Oppo’s Find X5 Pro. The phone has one of the best 6.7in OLED screens: bright, crisp and colourful with a 120Hz refresh rate to keep things smooth. The glass sides curve to a shiny metal band and a frosted glass back, which feels particularly nice and stops fingerprints creating a mess. The camera lump in the top-left corner blends into the metal sides and makes for an interesting design element. While big, its curved sides, relatively narrow width and about 200g weight make the 10 Pro comparatively easy to hold compared with similar rivals. It feels solidly made but durability testing has shown that the phone can snap in half if enough pressure is applied. Don’t sit on it and you should be fine. It lacks an official water-resistance rating, too, but should survive rain, splashes or similar accidents. Screen: 6.7in 120Hz QHD+ OLED (525ppi) Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 RAM: 8 or 12GB of RAM Storage: 128 or 256GB Operating system: OxygenOS 12.1 (Android 12) Camera: 48MP main, 50MP ultra-wide, 8MP 3.3x telephoto; 32MP selfie Connectivity: 5G, eSIM, wifi 6, NFC, Bluetooth 5.2 and GNSS Water resistance rating: None Dimensions: 163 x 73.9 x 8.6mm Weight: 200.5g The 10 Pro has the same top chip Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip as most high-end Android phones for 2022, performing admirably with a rapid interface and smooth gaming. Battery life is very good, lasting about 43 hours between charges on average, including three hours spent on 5G. That was with the screen set to the default resolution and actively used for more than six hours. That’s seven hours longer than the nearest rival made by Samsung, meaning the phone will need charging every other night with light usage. It lasts for about five hours of screen on time if the display is increased its maximum QHD+ resolution. OnePlus rates the battery for at least 1,000 full charge cycles while maintaining at least 80% of its original capacity. The phone does not contain recycled materials but is generally repairable, with a replacement battery costing about £20 plus labour. OnePlus operates a trade-in scheme and is included in the parent company Oppo’s yearly sustainability reports. OnePlus traditionally had one of the best versions of Android on its phones, OxygenOS. While that is still broadly true on this phone, it is now a tweaked version of ColorOS developed the by parent company, Oppo, as seen on the Find X5 Pro, with a slightly different look and operation. It is based on the latest Android 12 and will be updated with bi-monthly security patches for four years from release and supported with three major Android version upgrades. That’s reasonable but a year less support than either Samsung or Google, which provide faster monthly security updates, too. OxygenOS 12.1 doesn’t look quite the same as version 11 from last year but is still a stripped back and fairly slick affair, geared up for western audiences. It has some niggles, including overly aggressive closing of apps running in the background, which is designed to save battery but can delay message notifications or occasionally stop music playing. “Pinning” apps in the multitasking menu stops them being shut down. OnePlus’s software is still one of the best of all the Chinese smartphone brands but isn’t quite as top-notch as it used to be. The 10 Pro has a camera developed with Hasselblad, which is similar to last year’s 9 Pro: a main 48MP, 50MP ultra-wide and an 8MP 3.3x telephoto on the back, plus a capable 32MP selfie camera on the front The main camera generally shoots very good images that are well exposed with good colour balance. It can struggle in very high-contrast scenes but deals with low-light scenarios well. The ultra-wide camera is equally decent, if a little softer on detail and less sensitive in low light. It can shoot extremely wide or fisheye-style photos with fun special modes, too. The 3.3x telephoto camera has a decent level of magnification compared with some rivals and is capable of producing fairly sharp shots in good lighting. But it struggles in lower light levels, quickly becoming grainy. The cameras lack consistency in colour and exposure levels, meaning switching between them produces very different photos in the same scenario, but overall the three cameras are solid even if they can’t beat the best from Samsung, Google or Apple. The OnePlus 10 Pro costs £799 ($899) with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage or £899 with 12 and 256GB. For comparison, the Google Pixel 6 Pro costs £849, the Samsung Galaxy S21+ costs £949, the Oppo Find X5 Pro costs £1,049, the Galaxy S21 Ultra costs £1,149 and the iPhone 13 Pro Max costs £1,049. The OnePlus 10 Pro is a good alternative to a top-spec Google or Samsung Android phone. It offers a potent combination of speed, rapid charging, long battery life and big screen in an attractive, svelte body. The new OxygenOS software is generally good, if not quite as slick as previous versions. You will get four years of software updates from release, which is longer than previous OnePlus phones but a year or more short of Google, Samsung or Apple. The camera is slightly improved all round and generally very usable but it is still OnePlus’s weakest link, unable to trouble the best in the business. These slight knocks can be overlooked at £799, which is good value for a high-end phone, undercutting Google’s excellent value Pixel 6 Pro by £50 and the parent company Oppo’s Find X5 Pro by £250. If you want a good, premium Android phone not made by Samsung or Google, the OnePlus 10 Pro is the one to get. Pros: Slick performance, good software, good battery life, rapid charging, great screen, solid camera with 3.3x optical zoom, attractive design, reasonable price. Cons: camera not quite best-in-class, no water-resistance rating, some software niggles, only four years of updates.",News/Technology,OnePlus 10 Pro review: slick performance costing less than rivals,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/12/oneplus-10-pro-review-slick-performance-costing-less-than-rivals-battery-camera
4/12/2022,"“This is a story about how the past does not define you,” says Lorine Padilla, community activist, mother and former “first lady” of the Savage Skulls gang, about a new documentary on her life. She speaks bluntly, and with an understated, yet undeniable strength that has come from a lifetime of asserting herself in inhospitable spaces. She continues: “It’s how one person making one small change in their community can inspire many to find strength in their voice. It’s also about the strength of women.” La Madrina: The Savage Life of Lorine Padilla is absolutely a story about the strength of women, delving deeply into the female side of a South Bronx gang culture that has largely been eclipsed in the media by sensationalized visions of hyper-masculinity. It is the result of close collaboration between two exceptionally strong women: Padilla and Raquel Cepeda, a film-maker and journalist who also lived through many of the realities that Padilla shares as she tells her story. “I was compelled the minute I met Lorine to tell her story,” Cepeda says. “She reflects the archetype of the women who raised me.” In 80 tense, drama-filled minutes Cepeda takes viewers into the unpredictable life that Padilla lived while growing up within South Bronx gang culture, and how she emerged to become an agent of change in the community that created her. It’s largely a story of resilience against incredible odds. At one point, Padilla runs through a list of the dozens of people she has personally known who have died, tallying the men and the women. She seems sobered and at a loss as she tries to come to grips with the fact of her own survival in the face of so much death. Through archival footage, photographs and outtakes from Flyin’ Cut Sleeves – a three-decades-long documentary on Bronx culture that featured Padilla – as well as hours of interviews with the woman herself, Cepeda vividly evokes the era that the titular godmother lived through. Padilla’s reminiscences can be brutal: at one point she recalls baking a birthday cake for her mother as a child, only to have her mother smash it and throw it away. Another time she recalls her mother telling her: “You’re gonna be a bitch, because it was a bitch giving birth to you.” From a near-death bout with rheumatic heart disease to gang warfare, an abusive husband, and horrifying events that her close friends lived through, Padilla’s story verges on overwhelming. Yet, throughout these painful events, Cepeda is determined to go beneath the cliches and stereotypes of gang life to create a very honest portrait of Padilla, as well as a very feminist one. This provides a degree of balance and nuance that makes La Madrina’s harsh realities more complicated and interesting to engage with as a viewer. “Most stories documenting this culture tell it from a male point of view,” Cepeda says, “and they don’t give you a full picture and full story, aside from what people on the outside find sexy. I don’t see these [female] stories being told. Especially when it comes to the American Latino experience.” Central to telling these stories is the connection between the film-maker and her subject, which helped to penetrate beneath Padilla’s many protective layers. Padilla explains: “When you put lights, cameras and all of that, it becomes more difficult for me to tell my story. But because of Raquel, it became a lot more comfortable for me. It was like sitting at a table and having tea and reminiscing about my life.” In addition to offering her presence as a way of helping Padilla open up, Cepeda also places her subject in a number of comfortable environments, from a back-patio gathering with her girlfriends to folding chairs in the bustling middle of her neighborhood. Frequently, in these friendly surroundings Padilla is swept up in the moment, offering insights into a less-protected, more free-flowing version of herself. Although Padilla generally comes across with a forceful world-weariness that obscures more vulnerable sides, she also feels very authentic and searching, as though she trusts the film-maker and is doing her utmost to go to difficult places and tell a full story. Often, something emerges, seemingly in spite of herself. For instance, while speaking on the work she has done with survivors of domestic violence, Padilla declares that “a woman should never be asked, ‘why didn’t you leave?’”, then lists the reasons a woman would stay with an abusive man: “economics, fear, children, culture, religion, immigration, they’re undocumented.” She pauses for a moment of reflection then thoughtfully adds: “There’s also love, you really think you love this man.” Watching her deliver this litany, it seems as though she’s speaking it to herself as much as anyone, still trying to forgive herself for the time she spent with her abusive first husband, questioning how the love could have felt so real. The weight of this question is underscored elsewhere in the film, when Padilla tells Cepeda that when she finally left her first husband, “my life began”. These kinds of moments speak to the intense connection between film-maker and subject. “It’s kind of shocking to meet somebody from the hood,” says Cepeda, “of a similar experience and shared values, so it was kind of effortless.” Padilla rushes in to add: “Like meeting your tía [aunt].” Cepeda continues: “Yeah, like your tía. It was very effortless. In many ways, the more I got to know her, the more I got to know myself, and I felt like kismet was a work. I had more confirmation that I was supposed to tell this story.” Undoubtedly, Cepeda is the right film-maker to tell Padilla’s story, in part because these women recognize each other as authentic insiders who share a belief in the vital importance of their community. After moving on from gang life, La Madrina worked with those around her who were suffering from Aids and domestic violence, and today she continues to work in political advocacy and restorative justice, while living in the same public housing that she was instrumental in getting built decades ago. Although La Madrina does not present a full picture of the social work and activism that would come to dominate Padilla’s post-Skulls life, we do see many glimpses of it, and the importance of remaining true to her home resonates throughout the movie. “In making this movie, I learned that our stories matter,” Padilla says. “And that out of necessity women can be the warriors in our community and the voices. I’m just hoping you remember that for me it’s very important that one person can make a change, and you don’t have to leave your community to make your life and your surroundings better.” La Madrina definitely does show the possibility of staying close to home and the rewards that can be reaped by doing so – some may choose to deal with a difficult past by moving away and moving on, but for Padilla it is clear that her own form of resolution comes from engaging with the world that made her.

4/12/2022,"KFC has been accused of a “misleading” portrayal of chicken farming after activists revisited a farm recently highlighted in a film by a YouTube influencer. The Behind the Bucket film published last December saw YouTuber Niko Omilana visit a farm operated by meat company Moy Park, one of Europe’s leading poultry producers, which sells chicken to KFC. The film has been watched more than 1m times on the Twitter account of the news and entertainment website Joe. In the film, birds are shown in a shed, with fresh straw covering the floor and perches provided as enrichment. Visiting the farm in February, undercover investigators working on behalf of the vegan food brand VFC described finding severe overcrowding, little fresh straw and sick, lame and dead birds. Footage published by VFC from inside the farm, which has capacity for 380,000 birds, appears to show the floor sodden with animal faeces and little or no fresh straw. It also appears to show dead birds lying on the floor and sick, injured or lame birds. Bins containing dead chicken carcasses were also filmed. Viewing VFC’s footage from the farm, Prof Andrew Knight, from the University of Winchester’s Centre for Animal Welfare, said the birds appeared to be held at “very high stocking density, within a vast shed, which included little to no environmental enrichment”. He added that the “severe crowding and barren environment meant these birds had very little room to move, and to exercise highly motivated natural behaviours, such as foraging and exploring”. Paul Roger, a vet and founder member of the Animal Welfare Science, Ethics and Law Veterinary Association, said birds in VFC’s footage were exhibiting “behavioural signs of stress such as feather pecking and topical skin infection”. Matthew Glover, VFC’s cofounder, said: “This is the most disingenuous marketing campaign we have seen for a long time. This portrayal of chicken farming is utterly misleading and seeks to reassure the public that all is well, when nothing could be further from the truth.” In response to the allegations KFC said: “We take the welfare of the chickens in our supply chain extremely seriously. We will continue to work with Moy Park to ensure these standards are being met and we will continue to drive transparency, which is an important part of our welfare work – removing misconceptions and ensuring accountability across the industry.” A spokesperson for Moy Park told the Guardian: “Claims such as these are treated incredibly seriously and we immediately reviewed the footage along with independent audits and veterinary reports. “This farm is managed to a very high standard and our preliminary findings show that it is meeting those standards. The birds are displaying natural behaviours and the farm adheres to all stocking, enrichment and welfare requirements.” The company said that staff visit sheds a minimum of three times a day to assess the health and welfare of the birds. “A small number of birds may die between those checks and are identified and removed during the next inspection.” The spokesperson added that people in a shed at an irregular time could also affect the birds’ movements.Stuart Jones, director of Upload agency, which represents Niko Omilana, said: “Whilst we take these allegations very seriously and will speak with KFC about these claims, the filming that our client took part in accurately reported the conditions he saw and experienced on the day.” A spokesperson for Joe Media said that the filming it conducted on behalf of KFC reported the conditions they saw and experienced on the day.

4/12/2022,"New Zealand’s governing rugby body has failed to properly support women’s high performance rugby, with some players reporting favouritism, ghosting, body-shaming and culturally insensitive comments, a scathing review of one of the world’s top women’s rugby teams has found. The more than 30-page review, which came with 26 recommendations, was instigated after a senior Black Ferns player – Te Kura Ngata-Aerengamate – posted on social media that she had suffered a mental health breakdown following the Black Ferns’ 2021 end-of-year tour to England and France. “What became clear during the review was that Te Kura’s concerns were not isolated and some other players (particularly Māori and Pasifika players) had either experienced similar behaviour by a number of members of management (of ‘favouritism’, ‘ghosting’, cultural insensitivities), or had witnessed it, or had been told about it contemporaneously,” the review said. When asked why players did not complain, they cited being worried it would affect their chance of selection, they did not know how to raise a complaint, or it had been mentioned to management but nothing was done. Ngata-Aerengamate’s post included claims that the coach, Glenn Moore, had made a number of comments to her during her eight years in the team, including: that she had been selected but “didn’t deserve to be in the team”; that he was “embarrassed” for her; and she was “picked only to play the guitar”. She also revealed feeling low self-esteem, like she was walking on egg-shells, and that she was sworn at and made to feel like everything she did was wrong. Moore has not directly addressed Ngata-Aerengamate’s claims. At the time, New Zealand Rugby said it was taking the social media post seriously and would assign an independent panel to conduct the review, which was not to ascertain if the allegations were true but to provide an opportunity to make comments about the culture and environment. More than 50 current and former players, managers and coaches were interviewed. The reviewers highlighted a lack of support, unity, and communication gaps between players and management. “New Zealand Rugby structures have not sufficiently supported women’s high performance rugby in New Zealand,” it said, and went on to make key recommendations about the high-performance environment and culture. It said while New Zealand Rugby had done a “great deal of positive work” to move the Black Ferns into a professional era, it had not created a high-performance vision, and that needed to be addressed. It said the group needed to place greater focus on the rights and welfare of its players and management, and there was room to build cultural competency. The review also cited a lack of cultural diversity and women within the Black Ferns’ management structure, noting that the team itself is “an elite female team of which 50% are Māori, and 25% are Pasifika”. New Zealand Rugby’s chief executive Mark Robinson said in a statement: “This report highlights that we haven’t got everything right and we apologise for not having provided all the tools for our people to succeed.” “The Black Ferns have been great ambassadors for rugby; they have won five of seven Rugby World Cups since their inception and have added considerably to the mana and legacy of New Zealand Rugby in that time; the current group of players and management are part of this,” said Robinson. Moore has retained his role as coach, and will lead the team into this year’s World Cup. In a statement he said he has accepted the review’s findings, but that participating in high-performance sport presented unique challenges.“There are learnings from the review. I am committed to ensuring those are taken on board.” Women in Rugby Aotearoa chair Traci Houpapa told RNZ she was surprised Moore was keeping his role. “It does send a message to say they are retaining the status quo... [New Zealand Rugby] needs to think about what that sends to the players and to the rugby community,” she said. “I think the report tells us in many ways what we already knew, that these are long-time long-term systemic issues that have been affecting and impacting women who want to play rugby in Aotearoa.”",News/World news,"Black Ferns report favouritism, body-shaming and cultural insensitivity in scathing review",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/12/black-ferns-report-favouritism-body-shaming-and-cultural-insensitivity-in-scathing-review
