1/6/2022,"Novak Djokovic’s deportation has become a scarifying issue for Australian sport and the federal government, a political break point thanks to the inattention and ignorance of the prime minister, Scott Morrison. Morrison was so busy struggling to extricate himself from the mess he had created over the provision of reasonably priced rapid Covid tests, he had no awareness of, or capacity to fully deal with, the controversy so obviously set to arrive with the Serbian tennis champion.  Djokovic is a science-resistant opponent of Covid vaccinations – he believes because he had the infection once, he can’t catch it again. And it was obvious a hemisphere away he was ready to drive his worldwide celebrity and remarkable sporting record through the resolve of Australian authorities. No-vax Novak was confident he would be let through, or become a martyr. In this objective he was helped, unwittingly, by the prime minister of Australia, who finally got around to doing his job. “Rules are rules,” Scott Morrison eventually advised Djokovic, in an echo of a stern suburban dad scolding a child for staying out late. But it’s difficult to be severe with the tennis champ because the prime minister didn’t know the rules, either. On Wednesday, he duck-shoved responsibility for the world No 1 being allowed into Australia unvaccinated. “Well, that is a matter for the Victorian government. They have provided him with an exemption to come to Australia, and so we then act in accordance with that decision,” he told reporters, clearly not knowing what he was talking about. By Thursday, he had been educated on the matter and announced in muscular fashion it was a federal government matter, and the Serbian was out – one of the highest-profile figures ever to be punted from Australia. “Rules are rules, especially when it comes to our borders,” Morrison said in that scolding statement. “No one is above the rules.” And he ended the reprimand with a protective assurance: “… we are continuing to be vigilant.” The home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, might have been Morrison’s educator on the matter, as she issued a statement – headed “Australia’s border rules apply to everyone” – contradicting the prime minister’s Wednesday press conference ramble. “While the Victorian Government and Tennis Australia may permit a non-vaccinated player to compete in the Australian Open, it is the Commonwealth Government that will enforce our requirements at the Australian border,” Andrews said in part of a statement. Neither Morrison nor Andrews can now breathe easily. And nor can the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne. There remain stark questions about the so-called border vigilance Morrison was so hairy-chested about. Djokovic had a visa to get to Australia. What happened when he got here is one thing, but clearly he boarded an aircraft with Australian-issue credentials saying he had a right to land here. Payne will be pressed to explain where and how that visa was issued when there are so many restrictions on the travel of vaccinated Australians. Is there a tennis service, a net accord? Answers on these matters won’t arrive in a rush, as Morrison will wring as much political gain as he imagines he can from this. His keenness to be seen as the tough guy with Djokovic – once it was explained to him it unavoidably was his responsibility and not that of the Victorian premier, Dan Andrews – was the first sign that border protection would be ramped up. His problem is that even insulting and exploiting the world’s best tennis player will not be sufficient distraction from the growing confusion over the response to Omicron as it overwhelms towns and cities. Morrison’s admission that he gets rapid tests for free, while thunderously objecting to other Australians getting the same deal, quite simply stinks. If it’s not the hypocrisy or the deliberate misleading, it’s the broad policy failure of the federal government’s Covid response. There is only one tennis player being deported. There are thousands of Australians every day discovering they have been infected by the virus, and many others unable to get tested but who know they are stricken. None of them will feel safer because Novak Djokovic has been thrown out of town.

1/6/2022,"Tan Lili, the principal of Shanghai’s Baoshan No 2 central primary school, has been wrestling with a problem in recent months: her school does not have enough physical education teachers. She is not alone. Since China embarked in 2021 on a nationwide campaign to reduce academic pressures on children and increase the amount of active time they spent outdoors, primary and middle schools across the country have been struggling. In one school, according to Chinese media, only two PE teachers are available to coach 2,600 students.  One key law was passed in October, to reduce the “twin pressures” of homework and off-site tutoring on children, and drove many profit-driven education companies into bankruptcy. According to the official Xinhua news agency, the legislation asks parents to arrange their children’s time to account for reasonable breaks and exercise, thereby reducing pressure and avoiding internet overuse. Around the same time as seeking to reduce academic pressure, China has promoted policies for schools to help students exercise more. “We have 11 full-time PE teachers, but there are 43 classes … we are seriously lacking PE teachers,” she said in a recent interview with Shanghai TV. “The demand for PE teachers has now increased dramatically.” Some schools are encouraging PE teachers to pass on tips to parents about teaching personal fitness to their children. But still, Sun Dong, who leads the PE group at Beijing’s prestigious 101 Middle School, complained that “some of our teachers have to teach 21 classes a week”. PE teachers had for years played a minor role in the country’s education system: classes were mandatory in many provinces, but as students and their parents overwhelmingly focused on passing crucial exams, PE was rarely a top priority for many students and their parents. A “proposal to prevent the feminisation of male adolescents” from the education ministry earlier this year also led to an increased focus on PE from primary schools to universities. Schools have been on a hiring spree in recent months. Tan’s Shanghai school recently added five professional coaches, ranging from football to badminton to fencing. And late in October, a senior official from the country’s General Administration of Sport said that he and his colleagues were exploring the possibility of allowing retired athletes to work as PE teachers part-time at schools. “I’ve been teaching PE for 20 years, and this is the very first time I have the opportunity to speak in front of you, at the school’s teacher-parents conference,” a Shanghai PE teacher said last month in a post that went viral on China’s social media. China has had a long history of attempts to reduce students’ academic burdens, issuing its first directive in 1955. In the last 20 years, Beijing repeatedly promoted a nationwide “burden alleviation” campaign but critics said that without properly reforming the competitive national Gaokao exam system, it was only a slogan. But the new policy has not been equally received by parents across the country. “I’m sure the authorities’ starting point was good, but education is a whole-of-a-society issue. By simply asking schools to cut academic work and increase outdoors activity won’t necessarily help address the fundamental problem,” said one Shanghai schoolteacher and a parent, who prefers to remain anonymous. “That is: education inequality.” Mr Li, a quality control manager in Zhenzhou in the central province of Henan, said despite all the new regulations, his 6th grade daughter at Zhengzhou Ruiding primary school still has a lot of work to do. “The students are still under great pressure … After school, they spend most of their time studying and doing homework, and their spare time is still very tight.” Additional reporting by Xiaoqian Zhu.",News/World news,China faces shortage of PE teachers amid school exercise drive,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/china-faces-shortage-of-pe-teachers-amid-school-exercise-drive
1/6/2022,"Jana Santos has an unambiguous message for Jair Bolsonaro-supporting anti-vaxxers who want to sup a Moscow Mule or Caipirinha at her bar in south Brazil. “Don’t come. We don’t want you here,” said the mixologist and bar owner who recently placed a placard at its entrance instructing unvaccinated Bolsonaristas to steer clear.  Santos, 32, said she had decided to ban unjabbed Bolsonaro followers from the Cosmos Gastrobar in Curitiba as a result of his “villainous” response to a Covid outbreak that has killed nearly 620,000 Brazilians and battered businesses such as hers. “It was a cry from the heart – a protest against everything this president has put us through … He’s a wicked man,” the progressive publican said of Brazil’s far-right leader, who claims not to have been vaccinated and has repeatedly undermined Brazil’s immunisation campaign. Santos is not alone, as the poisonous political atmosphere enveloping Brazil contaminates even its pub scene and a number of watering holes tell their political opponents to get lost. In July another local taproom, Bek’s Bar, told boozers they could buy their beer elsewhere if they insisted on backing Bolsonaro. “I’d like to let it be known that clients who support the genocide of 500,000 Brazilians and thousands of other atrocities will DEFINITELY not be missed,” its owner, Giovanna Lima, 33, announced on Instagram.“I’d prefer to go bust with dignity than go against my principles,” said the leftist bar owner who serves takeaways in bags bearing the slogan: “Get out, Bolsonaro.” Bolsonarista boozehounds are still not short of alehouse options, with their radical president continuing to enjoy the support of about 20% of voters as he prepares to seek re-election next year. In Ouro Preto do Oeste, a frontier town in the heavily pro-Bolsonaro Amazon, diners can even order pizzas named after their populist leader thanks to the rightwing restaurateur Valmir Chaves. “He’s the most patriotic president Brazil’s ever had,” said the 58-year-old during a recent visit to his Bolsonaro-themed eatery Aquarius Pizzaria. Chaves said the Bolsonaro pizza was sprinkled with chicken, olives and two portions of palm hearts in homage to the white vegetable Brazil’s president used to harvest during his childhood in rural São Paulo. As he took an order of fried chicken, Chaves remembered how he had invented the patriotic pizza, which costs 64 reais (£8.50), and decked his bar with Brazil flags after Bolsonaro’s 2018 election. “People say I adore Bolsonaro – that I’m a Bolsonaro fan. But it’s not about Bolsonaro,” said the barkeeper, whose black Hyundai has been decorated with the words: “100% Bolsonaro”. “It’s about my country – and if there was someone else doing the things Bolsonaro is, I’d support him too.” Lefties are not the only thing unwelcome in Chaves’s Bolsonarian bar. A sign on the wall informs drinkers they will not be allowed to tune into Brazil’s largest broadcaster, TV Globo, against which Bolsonaro rails, just as his mentor, Donald Trump, rails against CNN. “To clients and friends of this establishment,” it reads. “We do not watch GloboRubbish.”",News/World news,Brazil’s bars choose their customers for their politics as election nears,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/brazils-bars-choose-their-customers-for-their-politics-as-election-nears
1/6/2022,"Wearing intricate costumes made of plants and adorned with tropical flowers, the women look spectacular. While their torsos remain completely still, somehow, impossibly, their hips are moving in circles so fast it’s almost a blur. These women are performing traditional Tahitian dance, or Ori Tahiti, in Tahiti’s annual cultural festival, the Heiva. And they’re not alone. Thousands of women across the globe, from Mexico to Japan, are doing it too.  According to a report published by the French ministry of culture in 2017, there were more than 12,000 Ori Tahiti dancers in the United States and more than 10,000 in Latin America. In Japan, the movement has attracted 25,000 dancers and is projected to grow to 500,000 by 2027. Ori Tahiti is a broad term that encompasses the many traditional dances native to the island of Tahiti, performed by both men and women. The most well-known is the ote’a, a very fast, hip-shaking dance performed by women. Another is the aparima, which features slower, more graceful body movements. Both dances are difficult to master, but absolutely captivating to watch. “The dance itself, in my eyes it is the most beautiful, powerful, sensuous and expressive,” says Tumata Robinson, a renowned Tahitian choreographer, costume designer and founder of acclaimed dance group Tahiti Ora. “I think Ori Tahiti is very complete, you know. It’s fierce, but also elegant and powerful, graceful, feminine when we dance. I feel beautiful [when I dance],” says Moena Maiotui, one of Tahiti’s most beloved professional dancers, who has travelled around the world performing, teaching Ori workshops, and sharing Tahitian culture. YouTube videos of her dancing, both solo and with the dance group Tahiti Ora, have racked up millions of views. “It’s always good to be on stage and to share the culture and what we love and the passion and also tell the story … with our hands and share this moment with the people who are watching.” Self-expression and connecting to nature are what Ori Tahiti is about for Rina Hanzawa. Born and raised in Tokyo, Hanzawa discovered Ori Tahiti in her early twenties. “I went to dance school and I found Ori Tahiti there,” says Hanzawa. “At the time I had no clue about Tahitian culture. But I fell in love with Ori Tahiti when I tried it. The Ori movement was so natural for me – it was just very comfortable to do so I felt a strong connection with it.” What started as a casual hobby soon became an enduring passion, which led to her competing at a national level. Hanzawa now lives in Australia, where she has set up her own Tahitian dance school, Tai Pererau, in Sydney’s northern beaches. “My fire of love towards Tahitian culture will never blow out,” she said. The dance that sparked that fire, however, was almost extinguished. The arrival of Europeans in French Polynesia, along with their religion and laws, saw Ori Tahiti banned or repressed for close to 100 years. At the end of the 18th century, dance was banned by European missionaries, who labelled it immoral. Then, in 1819, the Pomare Code, a set of laws laid down by the Tahitian monarchy, forbade traditional dancing outright. In 1842 the French protectorate allowed dancing – but with so many conditions that the practice was still repressed. It was only in the 1960s that the church began to lose influence and traditional dancing really began to be revived. During this time the first modern dance group appeared on the scene, led by Madeleine Mou’a. Damaris Caire, author of a book titled Ori Tahiti: Between Tradition, Culture and Modernity, says: “Little by little, by doing dance shows at hotels for tourists, Ori Tahiti became popular – even if the local population initially struggled to accept it.” By the 1970s, the Tahitian cultural revival was in full swing and from the 1980s onwards Ori Tahiti was rediscovered, reinvented and fully embraced by the local population. Despite a rocky past, Ori Tahiti has today become a way for Tahitians to connect with their ancestors, their land and their language. It is a celebration of a cultural identity and pride that was almost lost to colonisation. Now, it has become one of Tahiti’s best exports. Hinatea Colombani, a Tahitian cultural expert and director of the Arioi culture and arts centre, says it is particularly satisfying to see Ori Tahiti become popular in the very countries that tried to stamp the practice out two centuries ago. “For me it’s a revenge, because they celebrate our culture,” she says. “Ori Tahiti is for me a freedom. A freedom to move, a freedom for the soul … and a really important way to escape from the everyday and connect to my ancestors and to the tradition.” This year, the Heiva Ori Tahiti Nui international 2021 – Ori Tahiti’s biggest competition – had to be held online due to the pandemic. However, it still managed to attract competitors from 12 countries and territories, including two new participants: New Caledonia and Switzerland. Ginie Naea, from France, is a dance teacher at the Te Ori Tahiti school in Geneva. The school has more than 70 dancers, aged between eight and 68. After competing for the first time online in the international competition, they came away with fourth place in a group category and a first place for the solo ote’a – which was danced by Naea. “It was really a superb experience,” says Naea of the competition. “We danced in front of Lake Geneva and the mountains; it was just magic. The best part of the competition was actually the preparation and team cohesion that it necessitated – a connection that’s created when performing. There is a real bond between Ori Tahiti dancers, a real family that is created around the same passion. “Ori Tahiti is more than a discipline, it’s a way of life. It’s something that really completes me … an art in which I flourish – as a woman, as a friend, as a mother – it’s really part of my everyday life.”",News/World news,‘It’s a revenge’: the global success of the Tahitian dance that Europeans tried to outlaw,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/its-a-revenge-the-global-success-of-the-tahitian-dance-that-europeans-tried-to-outlaw
1/6/2022,"Berlin police dogs trained to attack perpetrators have been put on an enforced break, along with their handlers, over contradictions between the methods used to control them and a new law to prevent cruelty to dogs. The use of pulling collars to channel a police dog’s aggression towards an agitator or potential criminal contravenes the law, introduced by the former agriculture minister, which came into force on 1 January.  Police said that about 49 dogs, out of about 130 used for operations from arresting perpetrators to drug and explosives detection or locating missing persons, were suspended from duty until a solution was found that would not involve officers breaking the law. A police spokesperson, Thilo Cablitz, said: “We are currently unable to deploy a section of our service dogs due to changes in the animal protection act governing dogs.” Those suspended include dogs working alongside special forces, the SEK, and those used to protect people as well as to arrest offenders. The training of “Schutzhunde”, or protection dogs, involves being able to control when a dog ends an attack, by tugging briefly on a “pulling collar” to restricts the animal’s airway. The logic is that if a dog’s aggression, considered necessary for the apprehension, is not controlled, it could cause serious injury or death to the perpetrator. Under the new ordinance, brought into law by the former agriculture minister Julia Klöckner, the use of such punitive stimuli is no longer allowed when training dogs. While primarily introduced to improve standards of dog ownership in Germany, the rules are intended to apply to all German dogs, including guard dogs. The agriculture ministry has said its decision was based on scientific studies showing that punitive stimuli “contradicts the concept of animal welfare”. Included in the act are rules governing the all-round care and upkeep of dogs, from the size, temperature and ventilation of their kennels, to breeding practices. Dog owners are obliged to take their pets for regular walks, to spend time with them and to ensure they have contact with other dogs. Chaining dogs, except under certain circumstances and conditions, pinch collars and other equipment or practices considered to induce pain, are forbidden. Klöcker has said the need for an update to existing legislation was long overdue but had become urgent during the pandemic, as increasing numbers of people with no experience of owning pets had bought dogs, and cases of abuse were rife. Pet shop owners and breeders should also carry more responsibility for dogs’ welfare, she said. The law change has been known about for months but its effect on the daily workings of police attack dogs seems to have taken police and politicians by surprise. Stephan Kelm, the vice-chair of the Berlin branch of the police union, GdP, said a solution needed to be found, as the dogs’ suspension would have “severe consequences for domestic security”, and the union had asked for the federal interior minister, Nancy Faeser, to intervene. He said the act affected forces across Germany. “We are completely open to innovative training methods, in which it is not necessary to inflict pain. But right now we don’t know of any,” he said. Cablitz said police were having discussions with Berlin’s interior ministry. “We are in dialogue with the ministry in order to find a solution,” he said. The interior ministry has not yet commented.",News/World news,German police dogs sent off duty after ban on ‘pulling collars’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/06/german-police-dogs-sent-off-duty-after-ban-on-pulling-collars
