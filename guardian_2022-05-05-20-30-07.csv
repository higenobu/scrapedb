5/5/2022,"After a two-decade legal battle, Israel’s high court has ruled that about 1,000 Palestinians can be evicted from an area of the West Bank and the land repurposed for Israeli military use, in one of the single biggest expulsion decisions since the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories began in 1967. About 3,000 hectares of Masafer Yatta, a rural area of the south Hebron hills under full Israeli control and home to several small Palestinian villages, was designated as a “firing zone” by the Israeli state in the 1980s, to be used for military exercises, in which the presence of civilians is prohibited. According to the Geneva conventions pertaining to humanitarian treatment in war, it is illegal to expropriate occupied land for purposes that do not benefit the people living there, or to forcibly transfer the local population. Israel has argued, however, that the Masafer Yatta villagers living in Firing Zone 918, farming and raising animals there, were not permanent residents of the area when the firing zone was declared, and therefore have no rights to the land. The high court decision published overnight on Wednesday – ahead of Israel’s Independence Day on Thursday, a public holiday – accepted the state’s argument that the community could not prove they were residents before the 1980s, despite expert testimony and literature presented in court that showed the area has been inhabited for decades. The judges also rejected the claim that the “prohibition of forcible transfer set forth in international law is customary and binding”, calling it instead a “treaty norm” that is not enforceable in a domestic court, according to the Israeli international human rights lawyer Michael Sfard. The Israeli defence ministry, one of the bodies responsible for Israeli policy in the occupied West Bank, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Since the judges’ decision was unanimous it is not clear whether any further Israeli legal channels are available for the residents of the eight Masafer Yatta villages to appeal. While the ruling did not order evictions, should it choose to do so Israel could now move to forcibly expel the Palestinians at any time. “The court decision is a racist decision taken by a settler judge [David Mintz, who lives in an illegal settlement in the West Bank],” said Nidal Younes, the head of the Masafar Yatta village council. “We have been fighting with Israel in the courts for the last 22 years and it took this judge five minutes to destroy the lives of 12 villages and the people who are dependent on the land. “In the end, history repeats itself: Nakba after Nakba,” he said, using the Arabic term for the expulsion of Palestinians from Israel in wars surrounding the state’s creation in 1948. Eighteen per cent of the occupied West Bank has been declared “firing zones” for Israeli military training since the 1970s. According to the minutes of a 1981 ministerial meeting, the then agriculture minister, Ariel Sharon, later prime minister, proposed creating Firing Zone 918 with the explicit intention of forcing local Palestinians from their homes. Palestinian communities living within firing zones have been repeatedly threatened with home demolitions and the confiscation of agricultural land because they lack building permits, which are issued by the Israeli authorities and are nearly impossible to obtain. Residents of Masafer Yatta have also been subjected to intensifying attacks from nearby illegal Israeli settler communities in recent years. In 1999, 700 residents of Firing Zone 918 were evicted, but after an appeal by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI) the supreme court issued an injunction allowing the residents to return until a final decision was made by the high court. The injunction had remained the uneasy status quo until Wednesday’s ruling. Compromises put forward by the Israeli state that would have allowed Palestinian villagers to work inside the firing zone on weekends, Israeli holidays and for two non-consecutive months of the year were rejected by the Masafer Yatta community on the grounds that it would not be possible to sustain farming activities or make a living. Breaking the Silence, an Israeli NGO, said in a statement: “The high court has just green-lighted the largest population transfer in the history of the occupation since the early 1970s. “Deportation of over 1,000 people in favour of expanding settlements, outposts and training of Israel Defence Forces soldiers is not only a humanitarian catastrophe that could set a precedent for other communities across the West Bank, but also a clear step in de facto annexation of the occupied Palestinian territories and cementing military rule indefinitely.”",News/World news,"Israeli court paves way for eviction of 1,000 Palestinians from West Bank area",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/israeli-court-evict-1000-palestinians-west-bank-area
5/5/2022,"The Bank of England has raised interest rates to their highest for 13 years, with a 0.25 percentage point increase to 1%, as it responds to soaring inflation. It was the fourth consecutive rate rise from the Bank’s monetary policy committee (MPC), and takes borrowing costs to a level not seen since February 2009. UK inflation hit 7% in March, the highest level since 1992 and more than triple the Bank’s official target, as Russia’s war in Ukraine drove up energy costs, compounding the cost of living crisis in Britain. Although raising borrowing costs will add to the pressure on some households in the short-term, the widely expected rate increase reflects a desire among the nine-strong MPC to prevent persistently high rates of inflation from taking hold.

5/5/2022,"The Dry (Britbox) is a dramedy about a recovering alcoholic set in Dublin. Therefore it must open with a wake. Shiv Sheridan (Roisin Gallagher) is five months, 17 days, six hours sober and poised at that critical juncture where a weekend with your dysfunctional – and just-about-functionally drunk – family might be exactly the thing to fling you off the wagon. She has just returned home from London for her granny’s wake, which naturally begins with sandwiches and small talk round the open casket (“our side makes fabulous corpses!”) and closes with a wasted rendition of Will Ye Go Lassie Go. You don’t have to have read James Joyce to know all this deep in your bones, but it helps. Happily, the cliches powering The Dry are of the true kind. So many scenes, particularly in the masterful opener, bristle with beautifully observed moments. Such as when Shiv’s uptight sister Caroline asks her brother Anthony what they need for the wake. “Something that says death, but also hope,” he suggests. “Carr’s water biscuits … brie … booze,” she murmurs, beginning a list. Or when Shiv says she wants to say something at the funeral. “About what?” her mum asks, aghast. “Granny?” “Oh, I don’t think there’ll be any need for that,” her mum concludes. These are throwaway, very real interactions. Funny, yes, but as with most of the jokes in The Dry I rarely cracked a smile. The humour in this tautly written, expletive-laden series is funny like a thwack to the funny bone. Dramatist Nancy Harris, who won the Rooney prize for Irish literature in 2012, knows exactly how to introduce you to her characters and their troubled histories slowly, naturally and partially, as in real life. This is grownup showing not telling, with echoes of both Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag and Daisy Haggard’s Back to Life, though The Dry doesn’t always hit the psychological high notes of either. There’s Caroline, who, if she were any more Claire from Fleabag, would be moving to Finland for the sake of her cold, cold heart. She works in a fracture clinic and thinks anyone gluten free who isn’t a diagnosed coeliac is “just an arsehole”. The children’s parents are the real scene stealers, as is so often the case: Bernie (Pom Boyd) is usually found drinking, unravelling and spying on her neighbour, whom she’s convinced has murdered his wife. And Tom, played by the magnificently sad-faced Ciarán Hinds, is “riding” his acupuncturist and falling apart in his own inscrutable way. Every character, no matter how peripheral, feels fleshed out. The Dry is also particularly good on class: the posh AA meetings on Dublin’s Southside where the snacks are homemade Rice Krispies cakes, and the more spartan but also more real ones in the inner city, which as Shiv’s future sponsor Karen points out “is for alcoholics. It’s recovery. Not an aerial yoga class.” Harris also knows the power of inarticulacy, just how much a broken or unfinished sentence can say, particularly in families. “What you put your poor mother through,” hisses Shiv’s poisonous auntie Agatha on the front doorstep when she arrives home. “First, your brother dying, then …” At which point the door opens, and the conversation is closed. Like Normal People, with which The Dry shares a production company, there’s a great deal of melancholia, emotional integrity, astutely positioned piano music and good-looking folk. The lurches from comedy to tragedy, which can be almost drunken in their extremity, occasionally feel jarring, but mostly they’re vital and authentic. When Shiv walks into the room where her granny’s corpse lies and takes her cold hand, the shock and awe of death is instantly expressed. So too is its absurdity in the following scene, when she fights with her sister over whether to wrestle their granny’s embalmed body into a different blouse. It is ridiculous, awful and so sad. Just like death. Like all good shows about addiction, The Dry is about so much more than the road to recovery. It’s about alcoholism’s causes and effects; the generational traumas that can never be blacked out; the lifelong impact of the death of a child in the family; and the lies we tell our parents, children, and especially ourselves. At the wake we hear that the children’s beloved granny “never touched a drop in her whole life”. Less than half an hour later, Shiv finds boxes of miniature gin bottles hidden under her bed. All empty. “Granny,” she whispers to herself, “you little fucker”. The Dry has a heart as dark and nourishing as a pint of Guinness. It sobered me right up, and I loved it.",Arts/Television & radio,The Dry review – this painfully funny dramedy is like an Irish Fleabag,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/05/the-dry-review-this-painfully-funny-dramedy-is-like-an-irish-fleabag
5/5/2022,"On Tuesday, JD Vance won Ohio’s Republican nomination for US Senate. After lagging in the polls for months, Vance hit the tape first after garnering Donald Trump’s endorsement. Although Vance received under a third of votes cast, more than half of Buckeye state Republicans voted for a candidate who made his personal devotion to Trump a political cornerstone. The Republican party still belongs to 45th president. By contrast, Matt Dolan, a state senator whose family owns the Cleveland Guardians, the area’s Major League Baseball team, finished third with less than a quarter of the vote. Dolan publicly accepted the outcome of the 2020 election. He is the latest in a series of cautionary tales. In snagging Trump’s backing, Vance reset the template for winning his favor. You don’t need to have loved Trump forever. Bending the knee in the moment may be sufficient – as long as you have the right mix of attitude, backers and lies. Regardless, groveling is key. An ex-marine and a Yale Law School graduate, Vance now contends that the 2020 election was rigged. It wasn’t always like that. Once upon a time, Vance lauded Ohio’s voting procedures. Likewise, Vance has taken to trashing Joe Biden as something less than a legitimate president. Biden is a “crazy fake president who will buy energy from Putin and the scumbags of Venezuela but won’t buy it from middle-class Ohioans”. As for Trump’s past embrace of Russia’s strongman and war criminal, crickets. In the run-up to the primary, Vance hung out with Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz. Pressed on Greene’s recent attendance at a white nationalist conference, Vance offered his full-throated support. She is “my friend and did nothing wrong”, he declared. Being “in” with the Republican party’s extremes helps more than it hurts. As for campaign cash, Vance, a venture capitalist, enjoyed a financial edge supplied by Peter Thiel, the founder of Palantir and Vance’s business partner. By the numbers, Thiel donated at least $13.5m to a Super Pac that had Vance’s back. Thiel also served as a conduit to Trump world. In 2009, the German-born Thiel questioned the wisdom of expanding the right to vote to women and minorities. “Since 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women – two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians – have rendered the notion of ‘capitalist democracy’ into an oxymoron,” he wrote. There is also the matter of owning the libs. Last summer, Vance made clear that some Americans were more equal than others, and that he was unperturbed by Republican efforts at voter suppression. Instead, he embraced the politics of natalism. “Let’s give votes to all children in this country, but let’s give control over those votes to the parents of the children,” Vance announced. “Yes,” he answered, when asked whether that meant that non-parents would get a smaller say in how and where the US goes next. If the mainstream media took exception to Vance’s views, it was their problem. Not his. To be sure, Vance didn’t always groove to Trump. Vance nursed plenty of reservations about the one-time reality show host back in 2016. Six years ago, Vance oscillated between comparing Trump to the Führer and the only person to resign the American presidency. “I go back and forth between thinking Trump might be a cynical asshole like Nixon who wouldn’t be that bad (and might even prove useful) or that he might be America’s Hitler,” Vance texted his former roommate. “How’s that for discouraging?” Fortunately for Vance, Trump let bygones be bygones. “He’s a guy that said some bad shit about me. He did. He did. But you know what? Every one of the others did also,” Trump told a rally in late April. “In fact, if I went by that standard, I don’t think I would have ever endorsed anybody in the country … Ultimately, I put that aside.” Come the fall, Vance will square off against Representative Tim Ryan. On Tuesday, Ryan resoundingly won the Democratic primary with about 70% of the vote. In 2019, Ryan announced his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. His candidacy lasted less than seven months. Vance’s win may also be a harbinger of what comes next. If past is prelude, bet on the TV doctor Mehmet Oz to capture the Republican nomination for senator in Pennsylvania’s 17 May primary. Like Vance, Oz snared Trump’s endorsement – and, like Trump, Oz is a celebrity. “He has lived with us through the screen and has always been popular, respected and smart,” Trump said in a written endorsement. David McCormick, Oz’s nearest opponent, served as the CEO of Bridgewater, a major hedge fund, and in the treasury department under George W Bush. His wife, Dina Powell, worked in the Trump White House. But for Trump and his minions it is sizzle that matters. One thing is certain: Trump and Vance have it. Lloyd Green is an attorney in New York. He was opposition research counsel to George HW Bush’s 1988 campaign and served in the Department of Justice from 1990 to 1992",Opinion/Opinion,The Ohio primary shows that Trump still has a tight hold on the Republican party | Lloyd Green,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/05/jd-vance-ohio-primary-trump-republican-party
5/5/2022,"Researchers have hailed a breakthrough in the treatment of a common, incurable disease that causes hand deformities by bending the fingers firmly into the palm. A clinical trial at Oxford University found that a drug used for rheumatoid arthritis appeared to drive Dupuytren’s disease into reverse when used early on, a result described as a potential “gamechanger” for patients. “We are very keen to pursue this,” said Prof Jagdeep Nanchahal, a surgeon scientist who led the trial at Oxford’s Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology. “This is a very safe drug and it’s important patients can access a treatment if it’s likely to be effective.” The disease is named after the French surgeon Baron Dupuytren, who besides claiming the honour of treating Napoleon’s haemorrhoids, acquired the arm of a dead man he had “kept an eye on”, not wishing to lose the opportunity to investigate his permanently retracted fingers. Dupuytren’s affects about 5 million people in the UK, half of whom have early stage progressive disease. Dupuytren’s is largely genetic and more common in people with northern European ancestry. Though some call it the “Viking disease” there is no genetic evidence supporting a link. It often runs in families, but the exact cause is unclear with factors such as alcohol and tobacco use, diabetes, age and sex all seeming to contribute. Men are eight times more likely to develop Dupuytren’s than women and in western countries, prevalence rises from about 12% to 29% between the ages of 55 and 75. “The problem for patients with bent fingers is they interfere with daily living: putting your hand in your pocket because it catches, putting gloves on, and it can be hard to use a keyboard, and even drive,” Nanchahal said. Though more common in the past, some patients with severe and painful Dupuytren’s still request amputations. The disease is a localised inflammatory disorder that develops when immune cells in the hand drive the production of fibrotic scar tissue. This creates lumps or nodules in the palm. Sometimes the disease stops there, but it can progress, forming strong cords under the skin that steadily contract and pull one or more fingers into the palm. The lack of an effective treatment for early stage Dupuytren’s means most patients are told to wait until their fingers are sufficiently bent to qualify for surgery. While the tissue can be cut out, there is a risk of nerve and tendon damage, and the disease returns in about a fifth of patients within five years. Another option is to use a needle to perforate and then snap the cord, but the cords typically grow back. Writing in Lancet Rheumatology, the Oxford group describes how injections of adalimumab, a drug used for rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease, into nodules reduced their size and hardness compared with placebo injections. The volunteers received one injection every three months for a year. Follow-up examinations showed the lumps continued to shrink for nine months after the final injection. The drug, which costs £350 a shot on the NHS, blocks signals from immune cells which tell myofibroblasts to churn out fibrotic tissue. “We know the effect lasts for up to nine months after the last injection, but assuming that at some point the nodule starts growing again, then if this were approved, the patient would come back for another four injections,” Nanchahal said. Similar injections could help to reduce recurrence of cords after needle or surgical treatment. Nanchahal is discussing the data with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to understand what evidence they need to approve the treatment. Ideally, patients would be followed for 10 years to see whether adalimumab prevents hand deformities, but Nanchahal said this was not practical. “We have done the best we can in a patient population over a reasonable timeframe. We have measured everything we can think of,” he said. Prof Chris Buckley, director of clinical research at the Kennedy Institute, said the drug could be a “gamechanger” and prevent the disease progressing to the point that patients need surgery. Prof Neal Millar, an orthopaedic surgeon at the University of Glasgow, said the finding “could be hugely significant” in time. “This is a great step forward in understanding the disease, but longer-term evaluation is required if this is to be realised as a therapy,” he said. Prof David Warwick, a hand surgeon specialising in Dupuytren’s at University hospital Southampton said: “Although these are early results, this is an exciting and important project because it addresses cell biology. “Needles are simple and usually effective for a while, but the cord comes back. Surgery is usually successful but it takes a while to recover and occasionally there are problems. But supposing we can treat Dupuytren’s before it ever gets that far by addressing the cell biology? Now that would really change the world of Dupuytren’s.”",News/Science,Treatment for finger-bending disease may be ‘gamechanger’,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/05/dupuytrens-disease-hand-finger-bending-treatment-clinical-trial-oxford-university
5/5/2022,"Rishi Sunak was reportedly blocked from raising some benefits to help them keep pace with spiralling inflation as a result of out-of-date government IT systems. The chancellor was said to have wanted to help those in receipt of welfare more in his spring statement, which set out measures to tackle the cost of living crisis, but was criticised for not going far enough to help the least well off. Last month, Sunak raised benefits by 3.1% based on the consumer prices index measure of inflation last September. He faced calls from economists across the political spectrum to increase them significantly more, given inflation stood at about 7% – the highest level since 1992. The Times reported that Sunak considered doing so, but that the Treasury was told “you could only do it once a year and this was not the time of year that you could do it”. Blame was levelled on the antiquated IT system that distributes some legacy benefits – such as jobseeker’s allowance and the employment and support allowance. Both are being phased out to be replaced by universal credit, but hundreds of thousands of people still remain on the old schemes, which use an IT system about 40 years old. Changes to the legacy benefit payments have to be locked in in the autumn in order to arrive by spring. These are administered by paper-based systems and ageing, inflexible IT systems that take months to process changes, while universal credit updates can be done in a matter of weeks. A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions said: “Parliament voted to end the complex web of six legacy benefits in 2012, and as this work approaches its conclusion in 2024 we are fully transitioning to a modern benefit, suited to the 21st century. “We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living, which is why we’re providing support worth £22bn across the next financial year including our household support fund. “Parliament voted in March 2022 to uprate benefits by the usual measure.” The Treasury was contacted for comment. Despite mounting concern that the economy is weakening amid the cost of living crisis, the Bank of England was on Thursday expected to raise interest rates to the highest level since the recession caused by the 2008 financial crisis. Households across Britain are under intense pressure from soaring living costs driven by record petrol prices and rising gas and electricity costs exacerbated by Russia’s war in Ukraine.
