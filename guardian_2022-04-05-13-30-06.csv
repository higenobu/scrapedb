Long-tailed, blue, coal and great tits pop up every second or so; and sparrows come and go with goldfinches, while reed buntings and nuthatches slip in and out among the gaps. But the briefest, most maddening, if most wonderful of all, are the willow tits. I see them usually not as they arrive, but as they leave. They zip in, but intermittently and invariably when you’ve dropped your guard. Again! All they gift you is a mean, hard, visiting call – the driest avian sound in Britain – an invertebrate Zi zi taah taah, like the small complaint of an angry insect. Despite willow tits retaining wide breeding presence through middle England, most people never see them, partly because this verve-filled fidget is so elusive, but also because it has an identical twin – the marsh tit. Almost all features said to be diagnostic of one or the other I have recorded on the wrong species. They’re so alike that not a single Briton twigged there were two black-capped, caramel-backed tits here, until two German ornithologists put us all straight in 1911. Alas for us, this never-you-see-me bird is going again. Willow tits have declined by 94% since 1970 and half of its old range is now blank. Yet continental willow tits recur throughout Eurasia’s woodlands from Amsterdam to Vladivostok. So does it matter? It matters to the poet Steve Ely, who dedicated the slenderest volume to the willow tit with his wonderful pamphlet Zi-zi Taah Taah Taah. Few British birds, except Ted Hughes’ mythopoeic Crow perhaps, are so honoured with poetry that is so densely allusive yet of such thematic grandeur. It is a sort of Waste Land for the willow tit. Try to see the beast and you’ll know why Ely wrote with such passion and why willow tits so deserve a place in our poetry and our land. But the best spot I know to do it is here, where the strange, disconcerting context makes it seem like meeting a small beloved god – say, Vincent van Gogh – in the queue at McDonald’s.

4/5/2022,"The mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, has launched a digital campaign designed to persuade members of Florida’s LGBTQ+ community to move to the Big Apple, after their state passed a so-called “don’t say gay” education law. On Monday, Adams announced the launch in five Florida cities of digital billboards and creative ads denouncing the legislation, which bans the discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity from kindergarten through third grade. “I am the mayor of New York City but I have a message for Florida’s LGBTQ+ community,” said Adams, a Democrat. “Come to a city where you can say and be whoever you want. “Florida’s ‘don’t say gay’ bill is the latest shameful, extremist culture war targeting the LGBTQ+ community. Today, we say to the families living in fear of this state-sponsored discrimination that you will always have a home in New York City.” One slogan on the new billboards reads: “People say a lot of ridiculous things in New York. ‘Don’t say gay’ isn’t one of them.” Another says: “When other states show their true colors, we show ours.” The second half of the slogan is written in rainbow colors. Another sign says: “Loud. Proud. Still allowed.” Another: “New York City is alive. And so is free speech.” The digital campaign will run from 4 April to 29 May in Fort Lauderdale, Jacksonville, Orlando, Tampa and West Palm Beach. New York officials said the campaign would deliver an estimated 5m impressions. The Florida bill, signed into law by the Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, requires the implementation of “procedures to reinforce the fundamental right of parents to make decisions regarding upbringing and control of their children”. It allows parents to launch legal action against school boards if they believe policies overstep that “fundamental right”. On Monday, the chancellor of the New York City education department, David C Bank, said: “Educators work every day to make New York City public schools safe and supportive environments for LGBTQ+ youth. “From what we teach, to how we care for young people, we create schools that affirm and lift up the students and honor who they are. Children bring the totality of who they are into our classrooms, and the cruel actions being taken across this country to attack LGBTQ+ children is contrary to everything we believe in as educators.” Daniel Dromm, a former chair of the city council’s finance committee, said: “As a New York City public school teacher for 25 years, I have news for Florida: students are already saying ‘gay’. They see us on the news and on television shows. They know that LGBTQ+ people are their family, friends, and neighbors. “These ads will reaffirm New York City’s commitment to creating an inclusive school environment, in sharp contrast to the discriminatory policies of Governor DeSantis.” The Florida law has generated backlash from LGBTQ+ communities and from the corporate world. Last month, Disney employees staged walkouts over the bill after the chief executive of the entertainment giant, Bob Chapek, did not publicly condemn the bill. Disney, which employs more than 75,000 people in Florida, later said it would pause all political donations in the state.",News/US news,‘Loud. Proud.

4/5/2022,"Married mothers who earn more than their husbands take on an even greater share of the housework, a study from the University of Bath in the UK has found – the more they earned over their partner, the more housework they did. What flattens about the statistics released last week is how unshocking they are. It’s unshocking because for all the feminist T-shirt sales, the #MeToo hashtags, the kickass feminist Star Trek captains and the marches for justice, we all know – we all do – that straight domestic relationships are where the deeply ingrained gender stereotypes go, like vampires, to feed on women’s blood and maintain “eternal” life. We know this because data shows same-sex relationships distribute household labour more equally. We also know this because ongoing studies show that when it comes to household labour and unpaid care responsibilities, women consistently do more hours. And we know this because we have all heard a woman say “It’s just easier if I do it” when confronted by a male partner’s performance of learned domestic helplessness. Haven’t we? There are two myths societies tell themselves to pretend they are fairer than they are. The first is that a gender pay gap only exists because women leave the workforce to have kids, which is untrue because it kicks in as soon as working life begins, when they are childless. The second is that women do more hours in the home because men earn more and, gosh, earning more money is so tiring and time consuming. Just ask a relentlessly pooped bazillionaire like Jeff Bezos, compared with literally any girl who’s just worked a 12-hour shift for minimum wage in a bar on a Friday night – she’s a fountain of limitless energy. This myth, the Bath study neatly explodes. Women who earn more than men do more household labour, it concludes, because the situation implies a gender norm variation for which women feel obliged to compensate. Why obliged? The study says conceptions of masculinity are near inextricable from the ancient “male breadwinner” role. And I’ll say what the study can’t; women learn, as girls, there is no greater danger than a man who perceives his masculinity is threatened by them. The Bath research has appeared at an interesting time. A mutant alliance of conservative radicals and biologically-determinist feminist separatists are out to insist that the greatest threat to women is not the intimate partner violence of fact, but the swim-champ trans women of fiction. At the recent Newcastle Writers festival, Australian trans writer Yves Rees quoted a colleague’s observation: “if the gender binary were in any way natural, there would not be such a desperate fury to police it”. Yet self-appointed police there are. An avalanche of actively anti-trans legislation in the United States is not an “over there” problem when its scare-campaign talking points – always directed at women – are echoed both by Australia’s conservative MPs and the ambitious boys of its liberal Greens. Dare I suggest that the aggressive scapegoating of transgender women by an invested, patriarchal hierarchy is a cunning misdirection, given more money and more power for the lucky few is still not enough to provide women with gender equality in the home? “Woman” is a problematised term not because of any transgender activism. It’s because the modern expectations of what it means to be a “woman” are so demanding, contradictory and structurally unsatisfying, they are impossible for everyone. The western woman’s living generation is sandwiched between the hangover of traditional gender attitudes and the expectations of a culturally mainstreamed, “go girl” liberal feminism that has massaged “girls can do anything” to mean “girls should do everything, all the time”. No human being without superpowers can straddle it. Like attempting anything energetic with a hangover, it is doomed, doomed, doomed to fail! Today’s “woman” is supposed to people-please, yet also be an empowered #girlboss. You must meet increasingly exacting beauty criteria and yet practice radical self-care. The same publications exhorting you to diet and exercise constantly “for your health” will readily condemn you as fatphobic. You must have #nolimits – especially when it comes to sexual experimentation – and yet confidently enforce boundaries, “dump the motherfucker already” but have #couplegoals! The most important job in the world is still being a mother, so be an active parent, but not a helicopter parent. You should pursue your own dreams, but think outside the box, achieve a work-life balance but also lean in, ask for that raise, #BelieveAchieve and smash the glass ceiling. With your perfect face. It’s the old paradox that insists the apex of womanhood is to be simultaneously virgin, mother and whore – except also now do this backwards in heels, making six figures on a keto diet at yoga while vacuuming and everything’s live on Instagram. Culture is not encouraging this because it “reflects” any aspiration of the modern woman to be exhausted, strung out and burdened by feelings of performance failure. It’s because the patriarchy has realised liberal feminism’s Trojan horse potential to leave women so individually overburdened, stressed and anxious they don’t revolt against the vampiric masculinities in their lives. Because what are men doing at home while women do both more work and more housework? Data says: they enjoy a bit of gardening. Nice work, they say, if you can get it … and as the division and distraction of women continues, be confident they certainly will.
