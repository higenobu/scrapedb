1/31/2022,"We find ourselves in the dreadful position that both those running the country and those in charge of our largest police force are accused of misusing their positions (Sue Gray report: redacted version is imminent, say government sources, 28 January). On top of a series of scandals – including the Sarah Everard murder, the mishandling of the vigil on Clapham Common, and accusations of institutional corruption – the speculation about the Metropolitan police’s recent decisions over the Sue Gray report are potentially devastating. It is unclear why the police initially refused to become involved, only then at the last moment to intervene, and to intervene in a way that seems destined to affect the political process.  Important though these questions are, however, they are almost beside the point. The belief that the police are in some way colluding in a whitewash is now sufficiently widespread for the integrity of the institution to be at very grave risk. The police cannot operate effectively without trust and, once lost, it is very difficult to rebuild. Melodramatic it may sound, but we are fast approaching the point where the very future of the Metropolitan police in its current form is at stake.Prof Tim NewburnLondon School of Economics  Jonathan Freedland’s article (We don’t need Sue Gray’s report to tell us that Britain is run by a liar, 28 January) made me wish for one thing: that Sue Gray wakes up this morning and decides that enough is enough; that she walks into the Guardian offices, puts her full “partygate” report on to the reception desk and says: “I’ve had enough of people being denied the truth, of individuals dicking about and putting themselves above the people of this country, so please go ahead and publish it, because people deserve the truth for once.” If Sue Gray did this, she would become the one person we feel we can trust, because we most certainly don’t trust the government, or the police, not only to admit the lies, but also to deal with them.Penny ShadboltLondon  The Liberal Democrats, with their suggestion of a “stitch up between the Met leadership and Number 10”, are misrepresenting the real issue. Essentially, the House of Commons has chosen to use the report to establish the facts as a basis for reaching a decision on whether Boris Johnson has knowingly misled the house and should offer to resign. It is legitimate for the legislature to ask the police, who have initiated a judicial process, not to get in the way of this, which is far more important than the question of whether there were infringements of Covid-19 regulations, carrying at most a penalty-notice fine.Alan BaileyLondon  Politics has always been the subject of satire, but the fact that Joe Lycett’s tweeted parody Sue Gray report caused “chaos” and “mass panic” in government surely illustrates what many of us have believed for a long time: we are governed by people who can no longer tell truth from fiction as they have themselves become the joke (Joe Lycett says Sue Gray report stunt motivated by anger over friend’s death, 28 January).Jackie EppsAlton, Hampshire  Boris Johnson dismisses email evidence of his involvement in the decision to assist the evacuation of animals from Kabul as “total rhubarb” (Report, 29 January).

1/31/2022,"With the public distracted, there was something ghoulishly vindictive about the Department for Work and Pensions’ action last week (Universal credit claimants face tough sanctions in UK job crackdown, 27 January). It changed the rules without legislation or parliamentary approval. Jobseekers must now accept jobs below their occupation from the fourth week of making a claim for benefits, rather than three months, or face sanctions. The DWP claims this is because unemployment is low. But it is punishing victims twice. The tight labour market is due mainly to older people preferring early retirement rather than face health risks in available jobs.  Requiring unemployed people to take jobs beneath their abilities, including temporary and zero-hours jobs, intensifies the precarity trap. Someone becoming unemployed must wait at least five weeks before obtaining benefits. Then if they managed to start receiving them, they would lose disastrously if they took a low-wage temporary job, because soon they would be back waiting a further five or more weeks without benefits. You do not need a maths degree to work out that this new measure is cruel to people who have done nothing to deserve it. And taking a job below one’s qualifications lowers the probability of subsequently returning to one’s occupation and lowers lifetime earnings. The long-term solution to this cruel regime is abolition of the DWP, with a new agency for employment and training services, with the benefit function handed to HMRC.Dr Guy StandingSoas University of London  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

UK intelligence agencies played a key role in his interrogation, despite knowing that he was subject to unlawful torture. Yet we still do not know the full extent of the British role in torture and unlawful rendition during this era. The intelligence and security committee (ISC) was, in its own words, “unable to conduct an authoritative inquiry” or produce a “credible report” in its latest attempt in 2018. This was because it was thwarted from collecting the necessary evidence, as its report explains. This is unacceptable. The ISC in its current form is unable to complete such work.

1/31/2022,"Jonathan Liew’s decision to attack my support for sports projects in Israel as “sportswashing” is perhaps the most ringing endorsement of why such bridge-building efforts are needed (Sportswashing is associated with certain countries – why not Israel?, 24 January). When our liberal and open country holds its massive annual Gay Pride parade – the largest (if not the only one) in the Middle East, Israel is accused of “pinkwashing”. When Israel leads in environmental issues and breakthroughs in climate change technologies, Israel is accused of “greenwashing”. When our generous and supremely capable NGOs like IsraAid or Save a Child’s Heart provide support to communities in need around the world, we are accused of “aidwashing”.  The reality is that for some, Israel must and can only be viewed through the prism of a conflict forced upon us. This kind of monochromatic myopia washes away the Palestinian leadership’s decades-long refusal to make peace, as well as Hamas’s commitment to terrorism and outright refusal to recognise Israel’s right to exist. My sports initiatives, on the other hand, look to move beyond the conflict, building lasting bonds of coexistence and understanding across our complex region. A recent initiative included saving 167 Afghan women – mostly sportswomen – from the Taliban, through a daring and complex operation, when most of the world stood silent. I would presume that Mr Liew has not been to Israel, and has not seen for himself what is a complex and multifaceted society and reality. He is welcome to do so at my invitation.

1/31/2022,"When scientists hailed a breakthrough this month – a man with end-stage heart disease was given a genetically modified pig’s heart – some non-scientists found the idea familiar. The procedure had already been described by Malorie Blackman in her novel Pig Heart Boy. Reality, it seems, can make fictions come true, and Blackman joins a distinguished line – Jonathan Swift (who posited, among other things, two moons for Mars); Aldous Huxley (oral contraception, mood medicine, test-tube babies); HG Wells (atomic bombs); Orwell (telescreens, mass surveillance) – of writers whose works acquire, over the years, the tingle of prescience. More recently a number of novelists were blindsided by an actual pandemic overtaking their invented plagues. Christina Sweeney-Baird’s The End of Men was finished in December 2019, Bethany Clift’s Last One at the Party was published in February 2021 and Oana Aristide’s Under the Blue a month later. Lawrence Wright’s The End of October (May 2020) even imagines a coronavirus arising in east Asia. And Joanna Kavenna’s 2019 novel Zed, set in a near future controlled by a tech giant, becomes more real every day.  But perhaps that is to look at the matter the wrong way round. Margaret Atwood has said, in relation to her own dystopia The Handmaid’s Tale, that it arose out of an acute sense of the then-present; she was responding to nuggets of misogynistic authoritarianism cropping up in the news. Blackman noticed speculation about modified pigs’ hearts in the press; epidemiologists had warned of the threat of a major global pandemic. Swift’s work often mocked the scientists of his day. While it is true that all future is by definition fiction, these tales arise, argued Atwood, when a writer asks “what might happen if those trends continued … Would we like that? Is that where we want to live?” Seeming prophecy is thus a case of emotional and social insight tethered to current reality. In 1909, EM Forster published The Machine Stops, a short story in which “humanity, in its desire for comfort, had over-reached itself. It had exploited the riches of nature too far. Quietly and complacently, it was sinking into decadence, and progress had come to mean progress of the machine” – which, partly by shutting humanity into a cave underground, severs any relationship with the real world. It is an unnervingly accurate picture of the western world in 2020 lockdown – complete with isolations, Zoom-like calls and machine-controlled delivery of food and entertainment. This is one of the great things fiction can do: pay a particular kind of attention. It is a kind of eavesdropping, and a looking under the surfaces of things. Seen like this, it makes sense that a group of literary scholars in Germany was tasked with predicting civil unrest by reading novels and plays – and especially by noting reactions to them. Was a novel censored? Whom by, and why? Was it garlanded or a bestseller? They were not surprised when Azerbaijan, which had been supplying Georgian libraries with anti-Armenian books, went to war in Nagorno-Karabakh. The programme was halted after three years, but the point had been made. Though novelists are not seers, we would do well not to underestimate their grasp on what is to come.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on prescience in novels: reading the future | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/30/the-guardian-view-on-prescience-in-novels-reading-the-future
1/31/2022,"Up to 10,000 pupils missed an entire term of school last autumn, according to new analysis that estimates 128,000 children were withdrawn from state education in England in the year up to the January 2021 lockdown. The figures, based on data from schools collated by the education research group FFT Education Datalab, comes as the government wants new measures to boost attendance, while Rachel de Souza, the children’s commissioner for England, has vowed to track down missing children.  But FFT found that the number of children being taken off school rolls was no different from years prior to the pandemic, with most being home-schooled, moving to private schools or to other parts of the UK or overseas, soothing fears that the pandemic had caused a surge in children being permanently taken out of school. FFT looked at attendance data from the rolls of more than 5,200 primary schools and 2,600 secondary schools – a third of the total state schools in England – and found that about 0.2% of children enrolled at the same school throughout last term did not attend a single session between September and the end of 2021. “These sorts of proportions would suggest something in the order of 10,000 pupils on the roll of schools who did not attend at all in the autumn term,” the analysis, by the FFT’s Dave Thompson, states. In total, 86,000 children who were on school rolls for at least a month in the autumn term were classed as “severely absent” after missing at least half of their time in school, including those absent because of illness. Those most likely to be counted as severely absent were pupils with special educational needs. Children with an educational health and care plan (EHCP) were many times more likely to have missed half of school in autumn compared with other pupils across all age groups. While politicians and de Souza have expressed alarm at the numbers of pupils withdrawn from school rolls during the pandemic, the data suggests that the overall numbers are similar to previous years. The FFT figures show that more than 128,000 children out of the nearly seven million of compulsory school age had been withdrawn from state school rolls in the year to January 2021 – slightly below the 129,000 withdrawn in the year to January 2020, before the start of the pandemic, and the same proportion as withdrew in the year to January 2019. Of the 128,000, 57,000 are estimated to now be home-educated, according to the Association of Directors of Children’s Services, while a further 10,000 to 20,000 will have moved from the state sector to independent or private schools. The remaining 50,000 children may have rejoined schools in other parts of the UK, most likely Scotland or Wales, or moved overseas with their families. Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, said he wants to “end the postcode lottery of how attendance is managed in different schools and parts of the country”, with a new duty for schools to publish their plans to improve attendance. Schools are also being asked to join a new data collection trial that will share daily attendance status for each pupil with the Department for Education. The DfE also said it “remains committed to a registration system for children not in school” and plans to publish a formal response shortly.",News/Education,"Up to 10,000 pupils in England missed whole autumn term last year, analysis finds",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/30/up-to-10000-pupils-in-england-missed-whole-autumn-term-last-year-analysis-finds
1/31/2022,"Rayo Vallecano has defended its decision to hire disgraced coach Carlos Santiso to take charge of its women’s team, despite being aware of a leaked recording in which he encourages his staff to find a girl to gang-rape to help team bonding. Santiso was hired by Rayo on Friday even though he had been forced to resign from his job with the Madrid representative under-12s team in November following the leaking of a voice note sent to his coaching staff. Rayo are based in Madrid and the women’s team plays in the Primera División.  In the recording, which the Guardian has heard, Santiso tells his staff: “This staff is incredible, but there are things we still lack, that we still need. We still need, I still say it, to do something like what those from Arandina did, man,” he added, in reference to three footballers from the Spanish third division team Arandina CF who were each sentenced to 38 years in prison for the gang-rape of a 15-year-old girl in 2017. He continued: “We need to grab a girl, but overage so we don’t get ourselves into trouble, and to [cargarnosla – which doesn’t translate directly but broadly means to ‘screw her’] there all together. That’s what really brings a staff, a team together. Look at the Arandina lot: they went straight up.” Despite a backlash from fan groups, the club has said it does not intend to take action against Santiso or reverse the hire. Santiso confirmed that the message was real, according to the Spanish radio station Cadena SER, but claimed it was “an informal chat among friends”. Cadena SER also spoke to the Rayo Vallecano president, Raúl Martín Presa, who told them that he would not be drawn into the issue and would not be pushed into sacking his new coach. “We sign professionals, not people here,” he is quoted as saying. The Federation of Rayo Vallecano supporters’ clubs has demanded the club gets rid of Santiso and accused the president of “crossing another red line.” A statement read: “For Carlos Santiso, sexually abusing a girl is what really unites a team. We cannot allow a person with such grave thoughts in their head to sit on the bench and represent Rayo Vallecano.” Fans’ group Plataforma ADRV referred to Santiso as a “degenerate misogynist” who “does not represent the values of [Rayo] and we hope he will be sacked and no longer sully the name of our club.” A banner was put up at the club’s training ground declaring: “Respect for women: Santiso out of Vallecas.” The club’s backing of its women’s team has been in the spotlight recently with fans displaying a similar banner during a game in November calling for “Respect and dignity for the women’s team” after a player had to be treated by doctors from opponents Athletic Club because they do not travel with medical staff of their own. They also have no access to gym facilities and at the start of the season players refused to train because their contracts had not yet been signed. Given the precariousness of their situation, the players have not yet spoken out on the decision to employ Santiso. Presa has a longstanding dispute with fans at the club, who repeatedly chant for him to leave every game.

1/31/2022,"Vodafone has been targeted by activist investor Cevian, prompting speculation that the telecoms giant will come under pressure to shake up its faltering global business. The Swedish investment firm has built up holdings in Vodafone in recent months, according to sources quoted by Bloomberg, privately piling pressure on the firm to improve performance.  Shares in the British multinational have almost halved in value since 2018, with investor sentiment apparently declining through a series of acquisitions and sell-offs, amid belief that Vodafone overpaid for assets such as the German cable business it acquired in an €18bn deal that year. Cevian, which says it is a constructive investor in “overlooked, misunderstood or out-of-favour” firms, has gained prominence in the City after building up a 5% holding in the insurance firm Aviva, and has also owns a significant stake in education publisher Pearson, as well as Swedish telecoms business Ericsson. Nick Read, the chief executive since late 2018, will be under renewed pressure to reshape the business. Read accepted cuts to his earnings package soon after arrival to head off an investors’ revolt in 2019, after Vodafone said it could not pay a dividend after incurring huge losses in buying up 5G spectrum in European auctions. Supporters say he has made the firm more tightly focused on Europe and Africa, and took decisive action to write off entirely the value of Vodafone’s unhappy investment in the Indian market. Analysts have speculated that Vodafone, a £34bn plc headquartered in Berkshire, may be pushed by Cevian to shore up its UK position – possibly acquiring other telecoms firms to take on BT and Virgin Media, or sell down its remaining stake in the mobile masts business it spun off in 2019. Cevian and Vodafone did not comment. British phone rival BT is also facing boardroom pressure from the interest of an activist investor, with French billionaire Patrick Drahi’s Altice building up a shareholding of 18% last month. Drahi said he was “supportive of BT’s strategy” despite appearing close to a potential takeover – although the UK government could block any such move.",News/Business,Swedish activist investor targets Vodafone over weak performance,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/30/swedish-activist-investor-targets-vodafone-over-weak-performance

1/31/2022,"Britain’s politicians and intelligence chiefs have stepped up warnings about the likelihood of a Russian invasion of Ukraine over the past week, yet it is not clear, despite a drumbeat of activity, that a military attack is any more certain. That drumbeat has been matched in Washington, but, significantly, the concern is not shared in Kyiv. As Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Friday, high tensions with Russia are not new “We have been in the situation for eight years,” he said.  The analysis in Ukraine diverges from the west’s assessment of the crisis as primarily a military one. The belief in Kyiv is that Vladimir Putin’s goal is the long-term destabilisation of Ukraine, and that the Russian leader may have other objectives than invasion. Nevertheless, Liz Truss, the British foreign secretary, warned eight days ago of a possible Kremlin coup plot in Ukraine, possibly in tandem with a military attack, involving five former Ukrainian politicians. However, four already live in exile in Moscow, meaning their links to Russia are not a secret. On Tuesday, Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, warned that Russian “military advance force operations” – mostly thought to be conducted by GRU military intelligence – had already begun in Ukraine. Wallace was understood to be largely referring to pro-Russian disinformation activity. Kyiv has also noted their presence, not just in Ukraine but in the Moscow-backed separatist territories of Donetsk and Luhansk, and Russian territory on the border. British intelligence officials then warned in briefings that emerged on Thursday that Russia was “two to three weeks away” from assembling a 150,000-plus invasion force. That matches existing predictions of independent analysts relying on satellite imagery and other open-source, public domain material. The ratcheting-up has helped propel the Ukraine story on to British newspaper front pages at a time when the news in Westminster has been dominated by whether Boris Johnson can survive the “partygate” scandal. However, it would be simplistic to say it is entirely cynical. The concern is genuine in the security community, which is still recovering from the criticism that it failed to predict how fast the Taliban would overrun Afghanistan last summer. This time it will be possible to say the public have been given fair warning if an attack were to happen. Johnson said on Monday there was “a plan for a lightning war”. Meanwhile, the British warnings are being reflected in Washington. On Friday, US intelligence warned that “blood supplies” and other concrete indicators of an invasion were being moved up to the border, although Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said this was part of Russia’s “psychological war”. Mixed messaging followed a phone call last Thursday between Joe Biden and Zelenskiy. A Ukrainian official claimed the US president had said a Russian attack would be imminent once the ground froze in February, prompting a rapid White House rebuttal. What Biden had said, US officials insisted, was that an invasion in February was “a distinct possibility” – a serious enough warning nonetheless. That is a position that Kviv does not dispute, given in its estimate that about 119,000 Russian soldiers are camped out near Ukraine’s border. Nevertheless, senior officials in Kyiv believe that the latest signals from Moscow suggest the Kremlin may be moving away from a military confrontation next month. Speaking at a wreath-laying ceremony on Sunday, Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia’s security council, was dismissive. “Today, they’re saying that Russia is threatening Ukraine. This is absolutely ridiculous. There is no threat,” he said. “We do not want war. We don’t need it at all. Those who are pushing towards it, especially those from the west, they are pursuing some self-serving false goals of their own,” he said, adding that a war against Ukraine “does not suit us”. According to Kyiv officials, the Kremlin sent 95,000 troops to Ukraine’s borders last April. This time an additional 25,000 have been deployed – an increase, but not sufficient numbers to seize the capital, in what would be a massive and bloody operation to capture a city of over 3 million people. Officials have also suggested that Covid infections have swept through some of the Russian battalions, rendering them less effective. Either way, the picture may not become clear until March, when an invasion would become logistically difficult. However, Ukrainian officials say another crisis could then take place this autumn, following two previous military buildups, in the spring and autumn of 2021. Kyiv believes Putin is “cautious” and argues that his aggressive diplomacy has already brought results, forcing the US and its allies to take Moscow’s security proposals for eastern Europe seriously. These include a permanent veto on Ukraine and Georgia’s Nato membership and a demand that Nato pull back to its levels of deployment in 1997, when Romania, Bulgaria and the Baltic states had not yet become member countries. The White House has dismissed the demands as a “non-starter”. Alternatives for Putin, Kyiv believes, are that he may gain legal recognition for the separatist territories of Donetsk and Luhansk and formally send Russian troops to these regions under the guise of a peacekeeping mission. Russian troops are also thought likely to remain in Belarus once exercises there conclude on 20 February – closer to Nato’s north-eastern flank, Poland and the Baltic states. While the world is preoccupied with Ukraine, officials said, the de facto takeover of Belarus by Russia has been taking place at a rapid rate.",News/World news,Ukraine views Vladimir Putin’s goal more as long-term destabilisation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/30/analysis-ukraine-russia-vladimir-putin-uk-us-intelligence

He scored the equaliser and set up the winner, so Egypt will meet Cameroon in Thursday’s semi-final, a meeting of the two most successful sides in Cup of Nation’s history.  Egypt had ground their way to this stage, scoring only twice in four games. That’s the way it has always been for Carlos Queiroz and for all the success it has brought him, it can threaten to come unstuck if his side concedes early. Here they were behind inside six minutes, and it would have been earlier but for a weirdly extended VAR check. Ayman Ashraf clearly hacked down Achraf Hakimi and Soufiane Boufal caressed home the penalty. That forced Egypt out and, in the brief outbreaks of football between the whinging, the squabbling and the feigning of injury, there were moments when they threatened to look quite enterprising. But only moments, because this was a game that was rarely allowed to get going. It was a match in which the respective benches maintained a state of constant tension and at least as much energy was expended shouting at the fourth official as in trying to direct affairs on the pitch. The second half began with a brief football match. Egypt stopped moaning and started playing and the effect was immediate. Salah, having been peripheral, suddenly became a central figure, running at Morocco. He created a chance that Trézéguet, a half-time substitute for the injured Ahmed Hegazi, volleyed just wide. His involvement helped force a corner and, after Mostafa Mohamed’s header was saved, Salah was there to level with a smart sidefoot. And that, for the football, was that, other than a stunning Mohamed Abou Gabal save from a late Nayef Aguerd header. On the basis of that first 10 minutes of the second half, it was hard not to conclude that Egypt might have been better off just playing. Not everything should have to be attritional, but Egypt seem to want to break the rhythm of the game however and whenever they can. Abou Gabal’s protracted departure with a groin injury was dragged out longer than Glenn Close’s demise in Fatal Attraction. There is something depressing about seeing two such talented football teams with so little interest in playing football. It was no great surprise when a 16-man melee broke out with quarter of an hour to go with Hakimi and Mohamed the protagonists. Even then the allure of gravity proved too much for some to ignore, Munir El Haddadi flinging himself to the ground having felt a restraining hand on his chest apparently unaware that it came from the Senegalese referee Maguette N’Diaye. But ultimately, it was the ability of Salah that won out as he broke down the right and, having taken out three defenders, crossed low for Trézéguet to knock in the winner.",Sport/Football,Mohamed Salah makes the difference in Egypt’s fightback victory over Morocco,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/30/egypt-morocco-africa-cup-of-nations-quarter-final-match-report
1/31/2022,"The MP Rosie Duffield is expected to decide imminently whether to quit Labour, after accusing the party’s whips of doing little to protect her from what she called “obsessive harassment”. The MP for Canterbury is understood to be meeting senior party officials for discussions about her future after a party member accused her of moving 200 miles away from her constituency to be with her partner, a documentary-maker, in Wrexham.  Duffield, who was elected in 2017 and has held the only Labour seat in Kent, has faced a backlash from some within the party over her views on gender issues. The MP has a record of expressing gender-critical views and was called transphobic after liking a tweet saying women were people with cervixes. She said she felt unable to attend last year’s Labour conference because of the controversy generated by her remarks. Duffield has denied being transphobic. She has said she is “completely supportive of trans rights”. Her partner, James Routh, is understood to have been previously working on a documentary about Wrexham AFC, the non-league football club bought by the US actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney. In a series of tweets, Duffield described the new allegations – made in a blogpost – about her living arrangements in Wrexham as “personal, libellous, nasty and fictional crap” written by members of her own party. She said she was seriously considering whether to quit Labour because she did not feel supported by the party. “It is obsessive harassment. Neither the Labour party or either the former or current Leader or the Whips’ Office have done anything at all to stop it, to offer me any support, help or legal assistance. I am financially unable to pursue a libel action,” she tweeted on Sunday. “Kent police, parliamentary Security team and the Speaker’s Office have been helpful but it is the Labour party that have offered me no support at all since I unexpectedly became an MP 5 years ago. I am today considering my future in the Party very carefully.” Labour has recently asked its MPs to indicate whether they intend to stand again as part of preparations for a general election. Current MPs will be expected to go through a reselection process, though changes brought in by Keir Starmer make it more difficult for members to deselect MPs. A number of long-serving MPs, including Harriet Harman and Margaret Hodge, have indicated they will not stand again at the next election. A Labour party spokesperson said: “The party continues to be in touch with Rosie Duffield and has offered her advice and support.”",News/Politics,Rosie Duffield expected to make decision on Labour future imminently,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/30/canterbury-mp-rosie-duffield-considering-quitting-labour
1/31/2022,"A telecoms firm, a video games developer and a training company have become the latest businesses to join a four-day working week trial as scrutiny increases of work/life balance during the pandemic. Yo Telecom’s 90 employees will move from a 40-hour working week to a four-day, 32-hour working week with no reduction in pay for six months starting in June. They will be accompanied by game developer Hutch, with 120 employees, and MBL Seminars, with 70 employees.  The trial is being run by academics at the universities of Cambridge and Oxford, plus Boston College in the US and thinktank Autonomy. It is being overseen by 4 Day Week Global, a campaign group. The UK pilot study appears to have gained momentum in recent weeks, with the 10th business on the verge of signing up, with more than 500 workers. Hundreds more businesses have signed up to information sessions, suggesting they are seriously considering testing the move. Joe Ryle, the director of the 4 Day Week UK campaign, said the trial’s organisers were considering increasing the number of business participants from 30 to 50, given the strong response to the launch of the pilot. Other businesses have implemented the four-day week of their own accord, including app-based Atom Bank and the Landmark London, a five-star hotel, which this month said it would give chefs an extra day off. The Landmark decision came in the context of tough competition for staff in the hospitality sector, as companies chase a limited number of workers. Trade unions have said they hope the UK’s low levels of unemployment – at 4.1% of the workforce – will lead to higher pay for workers. A cut in hours for the same amount of pay can equate to much the same thing for many workers, who can pursue other jobs, training or hobbies in the time off. Ryle said: “In the wake of the great resignation, organisations should embrace the four-day week as a way of retaining staff and attracting new talent.” Nathan Hanslip, chief executive of Southampton-based Yo Telecom, said he hoped an extra day off would result in healthier staff and better customer service. “I feel the additional day’s rest our team will benefit from will push productivity, increase work satisfaction and improve general wellbeing above and beyond anything we have experienced in the past,” he said. Shaun Rutland, chief executive and co-founder of Hutch Games, said he started the business with a “no-crunch” culture that embraced hybrid working – in contrast to some parts of the software and games industries, which are notorious for long hours. He said he hoped for improvements in productivity and worker health, as well as a boost to gender equality and “a more sustainable work environment”. Morgan Rigby, chairman of Manchester-based MBL Seminars, said: “Now that we are getting to the other side of the pandemic, the four-day week is back on our corporate agenda. It is exciting, a new dawn for a new era. Whilst it will be a challenge, it is one that we are looking forward to.”",Lifestyle/Money,Three UK firms sign up to six-month four-day working week trial,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/30/three-uk-firms-sign-up-to-six-month-four-day-working-week-trial
1/31/2022,"My father, John Pennington, who has died aged 94, was a civil servant, a socialist and a trade union activist who was national president of the Society of Civil and Public Servants. Born in Aughton, Lancashire, to James Pennington, a farm labourer, and Amy (nee Balmer), a seamstress, he attended St Edward’s RC secondary school in Liverpool, leaving in 1945 intending to study English, history and classics at Liverpool University. Finding it oversubscribed with demobbed soldiers, he trained as a teacher at Bangor Normal College, north Wales.  He spent his national service as a staff sergeant in the Royal Army Education Corps, teaching illiterate young soldiers whose education had been affected by war and poverty. Stationed in Germany and Austria, he developed a love of the language and music of the region, signing on for a further five years with his regiment. In 1950, he met Agnes Starbuck on a blind date in Liverpool and they married in 1952 and settled on the Wirral peninsula. After their first child was born in 1953, John bought himself out of the army for the sum of £60 and joined the civil service as a customs and excise officer. He had great humanity and believed in fighting for fairness in the workplace. From 1955 he worked tirelessly for trade union members, becoming president of the Customs and Excise group, a national union, in 1973. When it merged with the Society of Civil Servants in 1975, he became president of the merged union, the Society of Civil and Public Servants. John was instrumental in campaigns for union recognition, notably the Grunwick dispute (1976-78) and at GCHQ in 1984. A Labour party member, he held officerships as secretary and chair on the Wirral at branch, district and constituency level. John took early retirement from Customs and Excise and from his union activity in 1985 to care for Agnes, who had some disabilities. He continued to serve on the Civil Service Appeal Board until 1997, and was a governor at Hillside primary school, Noctorum. He enjoyed following politics, rambling, birdwatching, music, his beloved garden, and tackling the Guardian cryptic crossword daily. He also learned to speak German, practising on the locals during trips to Germany and Austria with his eldest daughter. Agnes died in 1999. John is survived by their five children, Miriam, Martin, Louise, Richard and me, 14 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.",News/Politics,John Pennington obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/30/john-pennington-obituary
1/31/2022,"My mother, Margaret Ewan, who has died aged 73, was a teacher of art and design at a number of schools in Scotland, including Beath high school in Cowdenbeath, Summerhill academy and Oakbank school in Aberdeen, and Balwearie high school in Kirkcaldy. Although she enjoyed her time at all of those places, it was in her last job, at Kirkland high school and Community college in Methil, during the 90s and 00s, that she perhaps had the most fun. Often known by some of her students at Kirkland as “Ma Ewan” – and even occasionally receiving Mother’s Day cards – she referred to her time there as “the golden years”, marked not just by a great relationship with the children but a huge sense of camaraderie with her teaching colleagues.  Margaret was born in Keith, Banffshire, to Isabella McGregor, a Scot, and Thomas McDonald, a Canadian working with the Newfoundland Overseas Forestry Unit near Ballater. They put Margaret up for adoption as a baby, and she was raised by Cosimo and Wilhelmina brought up Margaret as an only child and absolutely doted on her, Cosimo even raising eyebrows by pushing her around in a pram, something that fathers in the 50s were not expected to do. She left Sacred Heart convent in Aberdeen to study jewellery, silversmithing and tapestry in the city’s Gray’s School of Art, and while there she met Neil Ewan, an architecture student, at a folk gig in 1966 at the local Blue Lamp club. They got married in 1972 and from 1988 our family – now including two daughters, Anna and me – lived in the coastal town of Burntisland, Fife, where Neil had been raised. After art school, Margaret gained her teaching qualifications from Moray House School of Education and Sport in Edinburgh in 1971, before embarking on her long teaching career and retiring from Kirkland in 2007. With Neil, Margaret shared a keen interest in Scottish history and was a long-term supporter of Scottish independence. She devoted her retirement to gardening, caring for her grandchildren and researching her family history. Having met members of her biological family in the 70s and 80s, a chance phone call in 2009 led her to discover two unknown brothers, Alex and Bert, who had been sent to Australia in the 50s as part of the UK government’s child migrant programme. In 2010 she travelled to Australia with me and Anna to meet them for the first time, and they remained in contact. Margaret was an empathic, clever and fun-loving woman who always gave so much support and love to those around her. Neil died in 2020.

1/31/2022,"Daniil Medvedev raised his eyebrows, swung his head to one side and mouthed “boring”. Tennis Australia president Jayne Hrdlicka was in the middle of her presentation speech, and listening politely to niceties was not a trick left in his playbook, which had already been sucked dry by the Spaniard standing next to him. It was peak Medvedev. Sore loser? Not really. He likely would have said the same thing even if he had won. Truculence is in his DNA – but not because he is Russian. The stereotyping of Medvedev is still very much alive. For years he has been cast as the “pantomime villain”, the maverick with a hint of crazy in his eyes. This past fortnight all manner of adjectives have been attached to his name in the arenas and on the airwaves. Even the “Russian devil” has somehow seen the light of day, a troubling trope that says more about the mouths from which it came than it does the player himself.  Medvedev would probably lament that typecasting of this nature is a sign of a “low IQ”. It might also just be easier to quantify complex characters prone to colourful behaviour by putting them into a little box labelled “bad guy”. Had he outlasted the indefatigable Rafael Nadal and been crowned Australian Open champion – and stopped the “good guy” Nadal from making history – he would now also be confirmation bias personified. In reality, the world No 2 is many things. Unorthodox and tempestuous, intensely confident with the talent to match. And also a contradiction of himself, both unflustered and agitated, calculated and over-emotional. He alienates his audience and in the next breath wins them back over. He tells a chair umpire – without a hint of irony – that he is a “a small cat”, and then apologises profusely. Informs the home crowd he will only watch the start of Ash Barty’s women’s final because it clashes with his dinner plans, then clarifies he will stream it on his mobile phone. Some of his more outrageous moments are visceral eruptions in the heat of the battle. On this particular night he boiled over in the fourth set. Nadal’s momentum had reached a crescendo and whenever Medvedev won a point you could hear a pin drop. When he lost one you could hear him, barking directives at chair umpire John Blom to quieten the chaos. “Can you take control, please? A small ‘please’ is not enough,” he demanded. “Step up. It’s the final of a grand slam. With idiots, ‘please’ doesn’t work.” Last week he admitted he “can get really emotional”. “I have been working on it,” he said. “I think if we look back at myself five years ago when I started playing there was less attention on me, but I was just insanely crazy.” But there is sometimes also a sense he knows exactly what he is doing, his craftiness communicated via that mischievous twinkle in his eye. Like after his quarter-final when, having fought back from two sets and a match point down to defeat Felix Auger-Aliassime, he revealed in his on-court interview he had asked himself “what would Novak do?” He stirs the pot, and revels in the reaction. On Sunday against Nadal, when he won a tightly contested second set, the boos and cheers came in equal measure. He simply spread his arms wide and beckoned for more. He hit a sitter of a drop shot into the net, was greeted by applause, then clapped his racket in sarcastic thanks. Living for the theatre. Thus it really had been no bother when he first walked out on to Rod Laver Arena to boos (not “siuus”). There were cheers, too, but the reception was decidedly lukewarm. Nadal had the masses in his pocket from the off, and he did not care one bit. Back at the 2019 US Open the villain motif was in full swing when, during his third-round defeat of Feliciano López he endured almost two hours of relentless booing and responded with: “I want all of you to know when you sleep tonight, I won because of you. The more you do this, the more I will win for you guys.” A few days later he played Nadal in the Flushing Meadows final, another brutal five-setter – when Nadal took a two-set lead – which doubled as an unlikely resurrection in the popularity stakes. The mutual respect clearly remained in this even longer rematch. “I want to congratulate Rafa because what he did today, it was insane,” he said. “I tried during the match just to play tennis, but after the match I ask him, ‘are you tired?’. I think the level was very high. You raised your level after two sets for the 21st grand slam.” Before this final Medvedev, 26 in mid-February, was the only man the whole tournament to have come back from two sets to love down to win a match. Nadal, in his heavily compromised physical state, should not have lasted the distance against the body up the other end. Medvedev’s is a gangly, willowy thing. One could fold him up like a pair of trousers and slip him into a drawer. But he is as powerful as he is elastic, with a serve that topped out at 214km/h (133mph) and a hard, flat backhand Novak Djokovic says is “strong as a wall”. At odds with his outbursts he is also a cerebral player, befitting somebody who excelled at physics and mathematics in school – he has credited both with helping him develop analytical skills fit for tennis. Mats Wilander describes him as a “chess player on a tennis court”. Opponents do not like playing against him because he is famously hard to read. His only predictable quality is that he is unpredictable. A smiling assassin who gets inside your head and gives nothing away in return. He wanted a second grand slam title – he won the US Open in September – and would use his unpredictability until the very end. Once he had reached it the game was up. Nadal served. He swiped at the net, hit one long, copped an ace, then found himself overcome by a winner – in every sense of the word. After the pandemonium, during that “boring” speech, he chatted and joked with Nadal. When he spoke he was disarming. The crowd love it. Again, somehow, he had won them back. Little did they know he was still scheming. “Last but not least, I just wanted to thank …” they waited for their acknowledgment. He paused, then said: “… my team again. Thank you, guys.”",Sport/Sport,Cerebral Medvedev challenges crowd and Nadal all the way to the end | Emma Kemp,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/30/cerebral-medvedev-challenges-crowd-and-nadal-all-the-way-to-the-end
1/31/2022,"My mother, Barbara Brandenburger, who has died aged 91, had only one response when she heard of someone in need – “What can we do to help?” A campaigning journalist and co-founder of the UK’s leading charity for Bosnian Muslims, she began championing the dispossessed while still at school, holding the hand of a Gypsy girl who had been shunned by the other children in the playground.  Born in London, Barbara was the only child of Bessie and David Cowan, both shopkeepers descended from Russian and Polish Jewish immigrants. Her father never recovered mentally from serving in the trenches of the first world war. During the blitz, her parents moved to Buckinghamshire and Barbara went to Aylesbury grammar school, then St Godric’s Secretarial College in London. At 19, she met Peter Brandenburger, 10 years her senior, who had been in the second world war. They married in 1954 and had two children, Simon and me. My father came from a background of great privilege, yet theirs was a true marriage of shared values. Barbara began at the BBC as a secretary – her boss spent most of her time devising knitting patterns, so she covertly took over her role of writing continuity scripts and then edited Ariel, the in-house magazine. In 1963, she wrote a book, Working in Television, for Bodley Head, which was a definitive text for decades. Her freelance journalism flourished, and she wrote regularly for the Observer, interviewing John Fowles, Noel Coward and Richard Attenborough, and writing on child development. My mother determined we should invite those who needed help to share our family home in Northwood, north London. And so nine-year-old Rabia, from Whitechapel, came to stay in the holidays and returned for years. At 17, my schoolfriend, Sara, lost both her parents. She came to live with us and my parents regarded her as their daughter. My mother cared for her own parents until they died and then she and my father moved to Parsons Green, Fulham, in south-west London. In 1992, war in the Balkans erupted. My mother watched the news and saw Bosnian Muslims being murdered. With her great friend Claude Murray, she launched a multifaith charity, the Bosnian Support Fund. In three weeks, 1,000 bags of warm clothes and a lorry were heading across Europe for Bosnian refugees, before the harsh winter. Then, they flew to Ljubljana to find a refugee camp to support. Accompanied by an interpreter, 17-year-old Faja, they found Harastnik camp with 200 people and focused aid there for 10 years – supplies, dentistry, therapists and, eventually, resettlement. Back home, they could not forget their teenage interpreter in Ljubljana, his family now under siege in Sbrebenica. He had represented Yugoslavia in the International Physics Olympiad. My mother sat next to a physics teacher at a wedding, and, a few weeks later, Faja received an all fees-paid scholarship to Oxford. By the time the charity came to a natural end in 2001, my father was frail, then Barbara was diagnosed with cancer. Her clean bill of health sadly coincided with my father’s death in 2009. Her home in Fulham remained an open house, an unofficial citizens’ advice bureau for friends, neighbours, local shop workers and market stallholders. My mother had an infinite gift for compassion. Barbara is survived by Simon and me, Sara, Rabia, and her grandson, Henry, and step-grandchildren, Charlotte and Mili.",News/World news,Barbara Brandenburger obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/30/barbara-brandenburger-obituary
