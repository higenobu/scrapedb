A judge held the suspect, Brent Brown, without bail during his first court appearance Wednesday. Brown is charged with kidnapping and rape. He told investigators the encounter was consensual. The man accused of kidnapping and raping Madelyn Allen, a 19-year-old college student in Utah, was denied a request to spend Christmas with his family during his first court appearance on Wednesday. Brent Brown, 39, was arrested Saturday after police found Allen in his basement, naked and covered in coal dust, according to the indictment obtained by Insider. He was charged with six felonies, including rape, aggravated kidnapping, aggravated sexual assault, and obstructing justice. In his court appearance Wednesday, Judge Wallace Lee of Utah's Sixth District Court asked Brown if he wanted to comment before determining if he'd receive bail. Lee told the judge ""like to be home for Christmas,"" local FOX13 reported, adding ""I don't get to see my kids."" The judge determined Brown be held without bail, citing that Brown was wanted for a separate felony in another county, according to court records. Brown also received a court-appointed attorney during the hearing. Madelyn Allen, a student at Snow College in Ephraim, Utah, went missing December 13 after leaving her apartment to meet someone she met online for a date, authorities said. Her parents became concerned the following morning when one of them received a text from her that ""expressed Madelyn's love for the parent but provided no additional details,"" according to the indictment. They contacted Verizon for her phone records, which indicated Allen was in Loa, Utah, 87 miles south of her campus. Police discovered text messages on Allen's phone with ""conversations of a violent sexual nature,"" the indictment said. Police initiated a search, eventually visiting a home where they encountered Brown. During a search of the home on December 18, they discovered Allen in the basement, hidden in a coal storage area. The indictment said Allen and Brown met on the messaging platform Kik. Allen told investigators Brown held her against her will, sexually assaulted her, and threatened her family, according to the indictment. Brown told investigators he had sex with Allen on multiple occasions but that it had been consensual and part of a kidnapping role play. Allen's family said Sunday they were ""overjoyed"" that Allen had been found, KSL reported. ""She is a fighter. She is now a survivor,"" Allen's uncle said. Brown's attorney and the Allen family's spokesperson did not immediately respond to Insider's requests for comment.

 Ted Kaczynski, commonly known as the ""Unabomber"" for terrorizing people with homemade bombs, has been transferred to a federal prison medical facility, according to The Washington Post. Kaczynski, who killed three people with homemade bombs and injured nearly two dozen others over a span of 17 years, was transferred on Dec. 14 to FMC Butner, a North Carolina federal medical center. The center is known for treating prisoners who are suffering from severe illnesses, the Post notes. Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman Kristie Breshears confirmed to the Post the transfer from a supermax prison in Florence, Colo., but declined to comment on the status of Kaczynski's health. The 79-year-old convicted murderer is currently serving multiple life sentences for his crimes. From 1978 to 1996, Kaczynski mailed or delivered sophisticated bombs and instilled widespread panic across the country. He was caught after his brother identified a publicly published manifesto as being reminiscent of Kaczynski's writing, the FBI notes. Kaczynski in 1997 pleaded guilty to the charges brought against him for the attacks, which he said stemmed from his hatred for technology. By accepting a plea deal, Kaczynski avoided being put to death but lost any chance of parole.",U.S./The Hill,"'Unabomber' Ted Kaczynski, 79, moved to prison medical facility",https://news.yahoo.com/unabomber-ted-kaczynski-79-moved-013833755.html
12/23/2021,"Four months after the fall of Kabul, Nasratullah, a young Taliban fighter, along with many others, still basks in the euphoria of victory. Recently married, he is now in charge of security at a Kabul police station, replacing his weapons with a walkie-talkie. ""When I started in the jihad against the Americans, I was 14 or 15 years old. During that time, my brother was our group leader and I used to participate in some battles. But when I turned 20, I spent all my time with the mujahidin and in battle."" ""For the past 20 years, Americans have occupied our country and attacked us in various ways. They have created a mindset in our people through the media and portrayed us as bad people."" With persisting security issues and a deepening economic crisis, the Taliban is now tasked to rebuild the country. A United Nations plan might be something that would help the dire shortages of funds hampering the new government. It is proposing to pay nearly $6 million for protection in Afghanistan to Taliban-run Interior Ministry personnel, according to a U.N. document and a source familiar with the matter. Its chief, Sirajuddin Haqqani, also a deputy Taliban leader, is under U.N. and U.S. sanctions and wanted by the FBI. The proposed funds would be paid next year, mostly to subsidize the monthly wages of Taliban fighters guarding U.N. facilities... ...and to provide them a monthly food allowance under an expansion of an accord with the former U.S.-backed Afghan government. But several experts said the plan raised questions about whether they would violate sanctions and whether the United Nations would be able to detect any diversions of those funds for other purposes.",Politics/Reuters Videos,U.N. plans $6 mln payment to Taliban for security,https://news.yahoo.com/u-n-plans-6-mln-135454456.html
