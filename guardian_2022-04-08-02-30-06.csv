4/8/2022,"Animal cruelty is abhorrent, and we welcome actions that unambiguously increase animal welfare. However, campaigns that conflate the cruelty of elephant rides and dolphin attractions with the conservation dividends supported by sustainable hunting (Letters, 1 April) risk decreasing animal welfare and imperilling biodiversity. We are concerned that pressure from well-meaning campaigners to enact the current animals abroad bill will not in fact “lead the way on animal welfare”. In particular, calls to ban trophy imports, a major component of the bill and a sadly misguided manifesto promise, risk removing key incentives to conserve wildlife in many regions of global conservation significance. Evidence shows that removing regulated trophy hunting – and the incentives it creates for conservation – without having viable funded alternatives ready can lead to greater losses of wildlife, due to subsequent increases in illegal, unsustainable and inhumane killings of animals using snares, dogs, local weapons and poisons. A single trophy-hunted lion generates worldwide media attention, but the daily snaring and poisoning of lions in areas where they have little local value is largely ignored.

4/8/2022,"Police officers failed a vulnerable and suicidal woman after arresting her and putting her in a police cell where she killed herself, an inquest jury has found. Kelly Hartigan-Burns, 35, died in December 2016 after she was treated with “reckless indifference”, campaigners say, by police in Blackburn. She had been arrested after members of the public spotted her late at night walking in and out of traffic in her pyjamas saying she wanted to die. Her family fought for an inquest to be held, believing she was failed by Lancashire constabulary at every level, from the control room to the response on the street, in her home and at the police station. A jury at Preston coroner’s court agreed, concluding that “if officers had shown more compassion, acted diligently, practised common sense, followed guidance and procedure from the moment they found Kelly and throughout her detention, there may have been a different outcome”. The jury gave an open conclusion, with a narrative detailing a litany of failures that they said contributed to her death. In October 2021 a finding of gross misconduct was made against Jason Marsden, the custody sergeant involved in Hartigan-Burns’s case, barring him from returning to work for the police. After the arrest late on 3 December 2016, police officers took Hartigan-Burns home to her partner, Cal, who was a mental health nurse. Cal warned police that she was a suicide risk, and police incident logs showed five separate mental health incidents involving Hartigan-Burns in the previous year. But instead of using their powers in mental health cases to take Hartigan-Burns to a place of safety, police arrested her for common assault arising from an argument she had had with Cal that evening. No consideration was made of her mental health history when she was put in a cell with no CCTV, and she was left on her own when the custody sergeant left two hours early without checking on her. His colleagues did not check either until she was found unresponsive in the cell and was taken to hospital where she died. June Hartigan, Kelly’s mother, said: “For the last five years we have been tortured by what we knew must have happened, by all the things the police did wrong, and all the ways in which Kelly might have been saved. While it helps to hear that the jury could see the same level of wrongdoing, the fact it has taken five years to reach this stage means this is something of a hollow victory.” Deborah Coles, the director of the campaign group Inquest, said: “Kelly was a woman in mental health crisis, in need of care and specialist support, not custody. Police officers treated her distress, vulnerability and suicide risk with reckless indifference.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

4/8/2022,"Individual players could be banned from playing in Champions League fixtures as punishment for breaching new financial sustainability measures, Uefa has confirmed. A replacement for financial fair play (FFP) rules was approved by Uefa’s executive committee on Thursday, and will be brought in this summer, with clubs in continental competition ultimately limited to spending no more than 70% of their revenue on players, transfers and agents fees. Sanctions for breaking the rules range from fines and point deductions to player and competition bans, but officials admit the changes will not be enough in themselves to redress competitive imbalance in Europe. Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin said the regulations had been agreed after more than 100 meetings with football stakeholders. “I am very happy, I don’t want to say even surprised, that we got support from all the stakeholders,” he said. “Uefa’s first financial regulations … helped pull European football’s finances back on track. But the football industry changed and alongside the inevitable financial effects of the pandemic, it has shown the need [for] reform.” Under the new rules, clubs taking part in European competition (and by extension clubs who hope to qualify in future) must comply with three different criteria regarding solvency, stability and cost control. Solvency measures will ensure that all payables owed are paid on time, with quarterly inspections. Under stability rules, clubs could lose up to €60m (£50m) over three years, but losses must eventually be covered by owner investment. Finally, cost controls would limit the money spent on players and coaches. Uefa will also monitor all sponsorship deals struck by clubs to ensure they are conducted at fair market value. Punishments for breaking the regulations depend on the size of breach and whether it persists. For smaller, shorter breaches, financial fines will come into place. Larger longer breaches could result in “prohibition on registering new players in Uefa competitions”, as well as limits on squad sizes. Uefa’s financial sustainability director Andrea Traverso said the possibility of relegating offenders, from the Champions League Europa League or Europa Conference League, was also being considered. “If a rich club overspends above the cap it will incur sanctions,” Traverso said, arguing that new rules would be tougher to circumvent. “There might be various ways to circumvent, to disguise payments of salary, but it [would] breach national law as well as Uefa regulations. Our capacity to investigate is limited, we are not the police, but we believe that in the way they are defined it is becoming more and more difficult to get around.” Traverso was forced to acknowledge, however, that the rules would not achieve greater competitiveness in European football. “Competitive imbalance cannot be addressed simply by financial regulations,” he conceded. “It must be addressed in combination with sporting measures and other measures. This is why we changed the name. The name fair play was interpreted as creating a level playing field, we wanted to change [that perception].”",Sport/Football,Players could face European bans if clubs breach new Uefa financial rules,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/07/players-could-face-european-bans-if-clubs-breach-new-uefa-financial-rules
4/8/2022,"Serena Williams has hinted that she will make her return to tennis at this year’s Wimbledon. The 23-time grand slam champion has not played professionally since last year’s Wimbledon, where she withdrew early in her first-round match against Aliaksandra Sasnovich due to a hamstring injury. The injury also caused her to miss the US Open, and she chose not to travel to the Tokyo Olympics. She did not play at this year’s Australian Open after saying she was not happy with her level of fitness. However, in an Instagram story with NFL quarterback Aaron Rodgers on Thursday the 40-year-old suggested she will compete at Wimbledon this summer. “We’ve been talking about my comeback and he’s been hyping me up and getting me ready for Wimbledon. Can’t wait!” When Rodgers asked her if she would play at this year’s US Open Williams said: “Wimbledon’s before the US Open, I’ve got to play Wimbledon first. Exciting!” Williams is chasing Margaret Court’s record of 24 grand slam singles titles. Her last one came at the 2017 Australian Open and she lost in the finals of the US Open and Wimbledon in 2018 and 2019. This year’s Wimbledon runs from 27 June to 10 July. She has won the grass court tournament seven times, her most recent success coming in 2016 when she defeated Angelique Kerber in the final. Williams is currently ranked 246 in the world. Earlier on Thursday, Williams’s long-time coach Patrick Mouratoglou said he is now working with Simona Halep. I am now the full-time coach of @Simona_Halep. pic.twitter.com/MRlkmeJyhw “Today I am starting a new chapter in my coaching career – I am now the full-time coach of Simona Halep,” Mouratoglou said in a statement on Twitter. “In the last eight months, I realised how much I missed coaching.

4/8/2022,"Russia has been suspended from the United Nations’s human rights council after its invasion of Ukraine provoked revulsion and outrage around the world. At a meeting of the UN general assembly on Thursday, 93 members voted in favour of Russia’s suspension, while 24 were against and 58 abstained. This met the required threshold of a two-thirds majority of the assembly members that vote yes or no, with abstentions not counting in the calculation. Sergiy Kyslytsya, Ukraine’s UN ambassador, had introduced the US-initiated resolution before the 193 members of the general assembly vote. He said Russia has committed “horrific human rights violations and abuses that would be equated to war crimes and crimes against humanity”. Kyslytsya added: “Russia’s actions are beyond the pale. Russia is not only committing human rights violations, it is shaking the underpinnings of international peace and security.” Russia’s deputy ambassador, Gennady Kuzmin, urged members to vote against the resolution. “What we’re seeing today is an attempt by the United States to maintain its dominant position and total control,” he said. “We reject the untruthful allegations against us, based on staged events and widely circulated fakes.”Kyslytsya responded to Russia’s complaints about the proceeding, saying: “We have heard, many times, the same perverted logic of the aggressor trying to present itself as the victim.” Russia is only the second country to have its membership rights stripped at the Human Rights Council which was established in 2006. The assembly suspended Libya in 2011 when upheaval in the North African country brought down longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi. The human rights council is based in Geneva and its members are elected by the 193-nation general assembly for three-year terms. The March 2006 resolution that established the rights council says the assembly may suspend membership rights of a country “that commits gross and systematic violations of human rights”. Thursday’s resolution expressed “grave concern at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, particularly at the reports of violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law by the Russian Federation, including gross and systematic violations and abuses of human rights”.

4/8/2022,"Who is shocked? “Outrage over huge pay rises for Manchester Airports Group bosses” was a Guardian story on Wednesday, just as the airport seized up. Those eight-hour queues of passengers were partly caused by the company’s mass redundancies; almost 900 jobs were lost at the airport group during the pandemic. No wonder it now has trouble recruiting, after the remaining staff took a 10% pay cut to help the company through Covid. Yet in that same crisis moment, executives had grasped themselves huge pay rises of almost 25%. The chief executive was awarded a £500,000 rise, taking his total pay to £2.5m. This is just one of the many stories from the boardroom troughs that have filled the business pages over the last decades, as fat cats have plundered the companies they manage while average wages have stood still. Here’s the question: is Britain so habituated to decades of kleptocracy that voters just cynically shrug this off, the way they do in Russia? The lid blew off top pay in the 1980s, and since then many of these masters of the universe have been severely undertaxed, according to a report on Wednesday from the IFS. A corrupted tax system allows those who register their income through their own companies to pay just 27% tax, by classing their earnings as “capital gains”: as employees, these high earners should be paying an average 42%, the IFS says. This deceit looks glaringly worse in a week where ordinary employees have been hit with the national insurance levy. Other types of incomes – whether capital gains, share dividends, professional law partnerships or landlords’ rents – doesn’t pay any NI contributions, and is taxed lower than earned income. Taxes on unearned wealth can fall to as low as 10% for the “business asset disposal relief” wheeze, or even zero when capital gains owed to the Treasury are mysteriously wiped out upon death. The one sensible thing Margaret Thatcher’s chancellor Nigel Lawson did was to tax all income at the same level, whatever its source, removing any incentive to distort earnings by shunting them through elaborate self-employment and company structures. The shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has proposed a similar policy. The government’s own creation, the Office of Tax Simplification, recommended aligning income tax and capital gains rates in 2020. So why did the Treasury shelve this measure? The only reason can be to please the very rich. These aren’t just the party’s donors, but the Conservatives’ social and political milieu. They make hyper-wealth seem normal and all attacks on it a danger to “enterprise”. The IFS firmly slaps down that idea. Helen Miller, the deputy director of the IFS and a co-author of the report, writes that “preferential rates on business income” change how people take their income, “but are not well targeted at promoting entrepreneurship”.” Rishi Sunak is in trouble over disclosure that his wife – whose annual income is £11.5m – is a non-dom quite legally paying no UK tax on the money she earns abroad. This illuminates a stratosphere of wealth far beyond the imaginings of most taxpayers. If Sunak never heard the klaxon about what this might look like, it reveals just how little he understands the lives of most people he is now subjecting to the harshest cost of living shock in living memory, let alone the poorest people who are well below his radar. A massive £100,000 donation Sunak recently made to his old school, Winchester college, displays a similarly alarming insouciance about the state schools he starves of resources, whose teachers earn 8% less than a decade ago. Of course, a plutocrat could be chancellor – all MPs are in the top 10% of earners – but to be a credible politician, it takes 10 times the social sensitivity of this fiscally conservative belt-tightener. The governor of the Bank of England displayed this same social idiocy when he called on workers but not boardrooms to show “restraint in pay bargaining, otherwise it will get out of control” even as real pay is falling yet faster after a decade of pay stagnation. The top 1% tend to defend themselves and their tax privileges with an angry retort that they pay 28% of all the nation’s total income tax and national insurance collected, so everyone else should be truly grateful to them and so should the Treasury. What’s more, the share of total income tax and NI they contribute is rising: they were responsible for only 20% collected in 2003-4. Well, of course it’s rising, because their earnings flew ever higher above everyone else’s since then, so they pay a bigger share. The gap between rich and poor has widened to the largest in more than a decade. The ONS said the income inequality gap as measured by the Gini coefficient had “steadily increased to 36.3%”, which was “the highest level of income inequality since 2010”. Is Britain now shockproof, too used to these familiar tales of greed at the top to react? Many, myself included, thought that the crash of 2008, when bankers’ risk-taking was bailed out by taxpayers, would mark the moment the public no longer tolerated unmerited, undertaxed rewards. But no. Until now, pay stagnation has been a slow frog-boiler. But this time, as food and energy bills arrive like Exocets landing on ordinary households, forcing immediate family spending cuts, not just for those in poverty but for people who are more comfortably off, too, the spectacle of boardroom greed and pandemic profiteering may ignite public indignation. If so, Sunak will become an increasingly uncomfortable figurehead for the Tories.  Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,"Of course Rishi Sunak’s wife is a non-dom.

4/8/2022,"Health officials in Washington DC have euthanized a red fox that was responsible for biting at least nine people on Capitol Hill, including a congressman, and which tested positive for rabies. The female fox was captured on Tuesday and by Wednesday, officials from the DC health department confirmed that she had been “humanely euthanized” so she could be tested for rabies. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an animal has to be euthanized in order to be tested for rabies as a brain sample needs to be extracted. “The DC Public Health Lab has confirmed the fox that was captured … tested positive for the rabies virus,” officials said in a statement. They also urged anyone who had come in contact with the fox to contact health officials, who are also “contacting all human victims who were bitten by the fox”. In a statement to NPR, a police spokesperson said, “[We] just learned people have seen foxes before, but this recent aggressive behavior is unusual,” adding that the fox was seen around the Dirksen Senate office building, the Russell Senate office building, and the House area of the Capitol. Health officials also found the fox’s offspring – known as kits – on Capitol Hill and are considering what to do with them. Among the people bitten is Representative Ami Bera, a Democrat from California who reported that he was bitten by a fox on Monday evening. He has since received seven shots, including five shots of immunoglobulin around the ankle where it bit him, one in either side of the buttocks, as well as a tetanus shot in the shoulder and a rabies shot in his arm. On Wednesday, Bera said he feels “healthy” and is “glad to be back at work”. Ximena Bustillo, a Politico journalist, was also bitten by the fox. On Tuesday, Bustillo tweeted: “That feel when you get bit by a fox leaving Capitol cause that’s of course something I expect in THE MIDDLE OF DC.” Bustillo said she was not contacted by health officials about the positive rabies test before they made the public announcement, the New York Times reported. DC health officials said they would “not be doing a roundup of healthy foxes in the area” and that the health agency “only intervenes to remove wildlife if they are sick or injured or where an exposure to humans has occurred and rabies testing would be warranted”. Since news of the Capitol Hill fox emerged, people were quick to comment on social media. One user tweeted, “The first honest thing on The Hill in 60 years, and they kill it.

4/8/2022,"Nicky Henderson’s quest to win the Grand National will go on for another year at least after his remaining entry in this year’s race came out at the overnight stage on Thursday, but he will have high hopes of a seventh win over the National fences at the Festival meeting when Mister Coffey (4.05) goes to post for Friday’s Topham Trophy. This race has been a trickier puzzle for punters than the National in recent seasons, with no winning favourite since 2008, but Mister Coffey has obvious claims after a luckless run in the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir at Cheltenham last month. The seven-year-old was badly hampered at the second fence, giving away plenty of ground before launching a strong challenge from off the pace in a race when most of the principals were prominent throughout. Friday’s race is over a much shorter trip but Mister Coffey had enough speed to finish second in a Grade One over two-and-a-half miles in February and has more scope for improvement than most of his rivals. Aintree 2.20: Jonbon’s unbeaten record succumbed to one of the great Festival performances of recent decades when he finished 22 lengths behind his stable companion, Constitution Hill, at Cheltenham last month. It is difficult to believe Willie Mullins’s El Fabiolo has been hiding a similar talent in his three low-key starts so Henderson’s runner should have little trouble adding a Grade One hurdle to his record before heading over fences next season. Aintree 2.55: A small field for this Grade One novice chase but all four runners have a top-level win to their name and the top three in the betting are closely matched on form. L’Homme Presse was three-and-a-half lengths in front of Ahoy Senor at Cheltenham, but likely favourite Bravemansgame was a late scratch there after the ground went against him and has a chance to set the record straight now. Paul Nicholls’s seven-year-old has not put a foot wrong this season and should arguably be favourite, rather than the narrow second-choice, on the balance of his form.

This looks like a slightly weaker renewal and Joseph O’Brien’s chaser will take all the beating. He arrived on the back of a close second in the Ryanair 12 months ago but skipped the Festival this time around and proved at Clonmel in November he can produce his best form after a break. Aintree 4.40: Skytastic’s stamina needs to be taken on trust but he found plenty to extend his unbeaten record on heavy ground at Ascot in February and is an interesting bet at around 6-1 to cap a breakthrough season for Sam Thomas with a first Grade One win.",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: Mister Coffey can take Topham Trophy for Nicky Henderson,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/07/talking-horses-mister-coffey-topham-trophy-nicky-henderson
