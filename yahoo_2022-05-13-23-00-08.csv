All current NATO members must agree to any new nation joining the alliance. Turkey's president suggested that he will attempt to stop Sweden and Finland from joining NATO. Sweden and Finland are soon expected to apply to join the military alliance, a development prompted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday that he did not support their plans. ""We are following the developments regarding Sweden and Finland, but we don't hold positive views,"" he said, according to Reuters. ""As Turkey, we don't want to repeat similar mistakes. Furthermore, Scandinavian countries are guesthouses for terrorist organizations,"" Erdogan said. NATO members can only join if all of the group's existing members agree unanimously on them joining, meaning that Turkey failing to approve their entry would halt any application.

It said the losses were a sign of how Russia's army is under pressure to show some progress in its invasion. ""Conducting river crossings in a contested environment is a highly risky manoeuvre and speaks to the pressure the Russian commanders are under to make progress in their operations in eastern Ukraine."" Russia has focused its efforts on eastern Ukraine after its attempt to take over the whole country stalled in the face of heavy Ukrainian resistance. Ukraine's defense ministry released photos on Wednesday that it said showed Russian equipment destroyed at the Siverskyi Donets river by Ukrainian forces.
