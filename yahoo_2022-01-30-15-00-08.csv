1/30/2022,"Missouri’s first Black congresswoman’s car was littered with bullets last weekend while it was parked in St. Louis. Despite sources believing she was not the intended target of the gunplay, the politician continues to receive a great outpouring of support from the community. NBC News states while U.S. House Rep. Cori Bush was not in the car when it was shot up, nor was she injured, but she is still shaken. “Like far too many of us in St. Louis, experiencing gun violence is all too familiar,” Bush said in a statement released on Twitter. “Thankfully no one was harmed. But any act of gun violence shakes your soul.” I'm touched by everyone who has reached out. Thankfully no one was harmed.

But any act of gun violence shakes your soul.

That's why our movement is working to invest in our communities, eradicate the root causes of gun violence, and keep everyone safe. https://t.co/AZHLUwiN6O — Cori Bush (@CoriBush) January 27, 2022 The progressive steered the conversation from herself and drew attention to a much larger issue. “No one should have to fear for their safety here in St. Louis, and that is exactly why our movement is working every day to invest in our communities, eradicate the root causes of gun violence, and keep every neighborhood safe,” she continued. A source close to her says that it is believed the shooting, allegedly on the morning of Jan. 22, was not intended for the congresswoman but the incident is disturbing. The representative also says that there was evidence that other vehicles were tampered with over the weekend in the same area of the shooting. One guest on Fox News described the incident as what he claimed is natural consequence of the defund the police position he claims is held by Democrats. New York Police Sgt. Joseph Imperatrice, founder of Blue Lives Matter NYC, told the anchor last week, “The harsh truth is we need the lawmakers to be victims.” During a segment called “American’s Crime Crisis,” another comment made on air was, “Of course, we would never wish any harm whatsoever on any American, let alone a politician we disagreed with. BUT…” Fox News reacts to progressive Congresswoman Cori Bush saying her car was recently hit with gunfire.""Of course, we would never wish any harm whatsoever on any American, let alone a politician we disagreed with. BUT…"" pic.twitter.com/Xsa6JdUmFK — Justin Baragona (@justinbaragona) January 27, 2022 Congressman Jamal Bowman, the representative from the Bronx, stood up for his colleague and blasted the right-leaning Fox mouthers, saying, “This is vile and disgusting.” “We are thankful that Cori is safe and unharmed. That’s the only thing that needs to be said. You all can sit there and continue to be mad and hateful. She’ll keep doing the people’s work with love and conviction,” he tweeted.

Former Ohio State Sen. Nina Turner also used her social media platform to support Bush, writing, “I love you and I am so sorry you, your family and team have to endure this just because you speak for justice.” It is unclear if Turner believes the gunshots were meant for the congresswoman or if she was providing sisterly support after various right-wingers and white supremacists as well as other groups attacked her. I love you and I am so sorry you, your family and team have to endure this just because you speak for justice. — Nina Turner (@ninaturner) January 27, 2022 Comedian Kathy Griffin tweeted in response to the shooting, “Oh my God, Congresswoman! Glad to hear you are unharmed, but so sorry you had to go through this traumatic experience.” Oh my God, Congresswoman! Glad to hear you are unharmed, but so sorry you had to go through this traumatic experience. — Kathy Griffin (@kathygriffin) January 27, 2022 This is not the first time that Bush has had her car violated. In 2020, her car was shot up. She shared the story on Twitter. She tweeted on Jun. 10, 2020, “My car took the bullets. I am safe. When I say that I am the people I serve, it’s not a slogan! A bullet went through my door handle on one side of the car, another went through my tire on the other side.

1/30/2022,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) -Thirteen people were killed when their van overturned and flipped into a ditch on a highway in central Mexico, leaving another 10 people injured, officials said on Saturday. Seven of the victims who died were initially trapped inside the car, the emergency services agency from Jalisco state said on Twitter. The accident occurred near the city of Lagos de Moreno, on a highway that links the central states of Guanajuato and Jalisco, during a season in which Catholic pilgrims often visit a shrine in the nearby town of San Juan de los Lagos. Photos from the emergency services agency show a large black van toppled onto its side in a deep rut along the highway, with what appears to be a shattered windshield. The agency said 12 people lost their lives at the scene of the accident, including two children, and another person later died in hospital.
