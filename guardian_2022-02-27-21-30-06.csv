2/27/2022,"Origin stories: they’re all the rage, and here comes the Hull Truck theatre company’s genesis tale. Writer Richard Bean takes us back to 71 Coltman Street in December 1971, where, in the beginning of Hull Truck was Mike Bradwell, and Mike Bradwell’s word was God. He and a cohort of actors stationed themselves in Hull to fight a battle against a Yorkshire winter and the prospect of employment. Bradwell jokes that it’s better than Stratford, because if you sign on there, “there’s a chance they will find you a job”. No such concerns in Hull 1971. He underlines the joke by explaining that the two funding streams of culture in Britain at the time were the Arts Council and the dole. It’s a good joke but it’s an old one, and that is the biggest issue with this production: most of the jokes are recycled and Bean completists will have heard almost all of them before. They’ll recognise the slapstick interlude from One Man, Two Guvnors, the jokes based on vernacular idiosyncrasies from Up On Roof and the one-liners from, well, all Bean’s work. He pulls off a nice, Noises Off-esque trick as he gives us a framing device early on (I won’t spoil the surprise). As Mike Bradwell, Kieran Knowles brings heft to the role. In fact the whole company is a demonstration in the art of perfect casting, from the ever impressive Lauryn Redding as Bradwell’s lover Linda to Jordan Metcalfe as frustrated playwright Julian. Then there’s local favourite Adrian Hood, who was comic pathos itself in Bean’s Royal Court hit Harvest. He gives a masterclass in comedy as Our Seth, a slightly confused overgrown child whose pets have a habit of departing this world prematurely. As you might expect for a play about Hull Truck, performed in Hull Truck to celebrate the half century of Hull Truck, there is an intense parochialism here. The East Riding jokes went over my West Riding-raised head: they will not play in Sloane Square. All in all it is a fun night and the raucous origin story of the theatre in which it plays is entertaining, but there’s an element of “stop me if you’ve heard this one”, and if you know Bean’s work you almost certainly will have.

2/27/2022,"The CEO of Shakhtar Donetsk, Sergei Palkin, has spoken about the situation in the country, insisting that Ukrainians will “withstand” the Russian invasion and win the war. The Ukrainian Premier League club has been on the move since the Russo-Ukrainian war in 2014, having to play their home games in Lviv, Kharkiv and Kyiv. Palkin, who has been CEO of the successful club since 2004, said at the weekend that the country needed “maximum support” from clubs in Europe and beyond. “The country is at war,” he said. “Russia has carried out a massive invasion of Ukraine. People are getting killed. There are no words to describe what is happening. The global community must stop this as soon as possible. I call upon the clubs we played – those are the majority of Europe’s top teams, as well as Uefa and tens of millions of fans, to provide maximum support to Ukraine. “This war concerns every European. Only by joining forces can we defeat this madness. I believe that together we will withstand it and win. I experienced a lot of bright moments with Shakhtar, but for me personally, the biggest victory in my life will be winning this war for Ukraine’s independence.” The 47-year-old said that he was still in Kyiv – and so are most of the club’s staff and players. He added that the club were trying to help their foreign players to get out of the country. “The club staff stay at their homes, in bomb shelters, basements, down in the tube stations. Just there where it’s safer. At the moment, according to the data available, there are no casualties among the staff and their families. We try to maintain the internal communication, exchange information, support each other. “All our thoughts today are about the end of this crazy war. About the Ukrainian soldiers, about those who defend our country and its right to sovereignty and independence. I believe that together we will win!”",Sport/Football,‘Together we will win’ – Shakhtar CEO sends out defiant message from Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/27/together-we-will-win-shakhtar-ceo-sends-out-defiant-message-from-ukraine
2/27/2022,"The Iranian ambassador to the UK has been ordered back to Tehran and is to be removed from his post after a video circulated showing an embassy reception at which some women did not have their heads covered. News of Mohsen Baharvand’s return to Tehran was reported by the ILNA news agency in Iran. At the event commemorating the 43rd Iranian Revolution, a woman playing a piano alongside a violinist was not wearing a hijab. Another video of the event showed a more conventional gathering at which speeches were given. An Iranian in London tweeted a video of the event, attended largely by diplomats, asking whether the party would “with the presence of these people have the slightest benefit for the Iranian people?”. He later tweeted: “It is gratifying that our voice was heard in Iran. Please send an ambassador to London who is pragmatic and worthy of serving Iran and working only for the benefit of the Iranian people.” The news circulated first in pro-regime newspapers, and some claimed it was part of a wider reorganisation of the Iranian diplomatic service being carried out by the new more hardline government led by Ebrahim Raisi, elected last June. Baharvand was appointed by the foreign ministry before the presidential elections, but took up his London posting in July after the change in leadership of the department. He was previously the deputy head of the legal department in Iran under Mohammad Javad Zarif, the former foreign minister. In his dealings with reporters in the UK, the ambassador did not stray from the official government position on the Iran nuclear talks, but tried to explain the context of Iranian thinking. His departure comes at a critical time in British-Iranian relations. Iran is on the cusp of deciding whether to accept Washington’s terms for a US return to the Iran nuclear deal, including the lifting of many sanctions. Alongside the nuclear talks, Britain is seeking to secure the release of three British-Iranian dual nationals detained in Iran. The Islamic Consultative Assembly, Iran’s parliament, met in private session on Sunday to review the state of the talks that many say could finally reach a conclusion this week. Ali Bagheri, the Iranian chief negotiator, is due to return on Sunday to Vienna, where the Iran talks are taking place, with fresh final instructions. Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, Iran’s foreign minister, is to meet Iran’s supreme national security council on Monday, and there is talk of a special session of Iran’s parliament on Tuesday. The foreign minister said the talks were continuing, stressing nothing was agreed until everything was agreed. Issues remain around assurances on the US’s long-term commitment to the deal, and the extent of sanction suspension. Both sides seem to be trying to prevent the fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to spill into the critical last days of the Vienna talks. Russia has, as a signatory to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action – the technical term for the 2015 deal – acted as a key mediator in the months-long talks in Vienna between European powers, the US and Iran. The Russian ambassador in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, has been a passionate defender of the invasion. Opponents of the deal, not necessarily party to the negotiations, fear an agreement will give Iran leeway to become a nuclear power relatively quickly and argue that the west’s experience with Russia shows that appeasement of fundamentally hostile powers does not work, and only emboldens them. Some Iranian political scientists have urged Iran not to be too outspoken in its support of Russia, fearing it will make it more difficult for the Biden administration to win political support for the deal. But Ali Shamkhani, the secretary of Iran’s supreme national security council, said the war was the direct responsibility of the west’s drive to threaten the security of other countries. Amir-Abdollahian has also criticised Nato provocations without endorsing the violence. Iran takes the view that the era of cold war blocs is over, and America is in long-term decline, but that it is important for Iran to steer an independent course and not become a client of China.",News/World news,Iranian ambassador to UK removed from post over hijab incident,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/iranian-ambassador-to-uk-removed-from-post-over-hijab-incident
2/27/2022,"When asked why Emily Maitlis and Jon Sopel had quit the BBC to host a new podcast for LBC owner Global Radio, one BBC employee who has worked with them responded: “How would you like more money and more freedom, all without the Daily Mail criticising you every day?” As the corporation prepares to celebrate its 100th anniversary later this year, its position as the dominant broadcaster in British political news and debate programming is starting to look shaky. Although the total audience for its radio and television channels and website remains far ahead of the competition, it is being chipped away around the edges. Perhaps most crucially, the current media industry is increasingly built around securing big-name on-air talent who have their own loyal audiences – and the BBC is struggling to retain some of its biggest names, with the likes of Andrew Marr also leaving the corporation in search of fresh challenges. Two big factors have changed the market for news programming. First, the rise of political debate podcasts and online video means the BBC’s in-built advantage of controlling the most popular radio and television channels is no longer the same guarantee of success. While Radio 4 retains an enormous audience – a fifth of the country tunes in every week – BBC radio has an ageing audience. Listeners, especially younger ones, are more likely to listen to podcasts or stream radio online, making it easier for them to try new outlets – with LBC among the first to spot the opportunity to build a new audience for talk radio. Second, commercial media businesses are investing heavily at the same time that the BBC is making seemingly endless financial cuts due to government-imposed licence fee freezes. Combined with an industry-wide skills shortage, this has made it easy for commercial outlets to pick off experienced BBC journalists who can put together shows that appeal to the high-end wealthy listeners beloved by advertisers. One person who recently left the BBC said they were regularly in touch with colleagues who are interested in joining the commercial sector: “There aren’t enough good people out there for the amount of work there is. No boring BBC meetings, flexible working, [it’s a] no-brainer.” BBC staff can get substantial pay rises and faster career progression by applying for jobs at the likes of Rupert Murdoch’s TimesRadio or the forthcoming Piers Morgan-fronted talkTV. Commercial radio is also less concerned by impartiality – which led to Maitlis being ticked off repeatedly by the BBC over her social media posts. And it allows its presenters to earn big money on the corporate speaking circuit without forcing them to publish their outside earnings. There is also a sense among some of the staff on the BBC’s leading podcast that the corporation still struggles to prioritise investment in its digital output over broadcast channels. BBC Sounds, the hub for all of the corporation’s audio content, has had a bumpy ride, with its dedicated podcast commissioning team largely disbanded in an internal power struggle with Radio 4 and 5Live. Damningly, the media regulator, Ofcom, recently concluded that, rather than the BBC dominating the digital audio market, there was strong evidence “that commercial radio has been more successful at attracting online listeners than BBC Sounds”. Yet while Maitlis and Sopel’s move grabbed the headlines, the departure that caused most concern among staff in the BBC newsroom this week was that of Debbie Ramsay, the corporation’s most senior black news executive, who announced she was quitting to join Channel 4. Younger members of the BBC newsroom who had looked up to her as a role model were particularly upset by her decision to quit – and pointed to it as another example of the corporation’s struggle to retain senior staff from diverse backgrounds.",News/Media,BBC’s grip on news programming shaky as commercial outlets pick off journalists,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/27/bbcs-grip-on-news-programming-shaky-as-commercial-outlets-pick-off-journalists
2/27/2022,"As a global bestseller with rave reviews, set in New York, and with a cult following, A Little Life appears to have all the ingredients for a hit television show. But according to its author, Hanya Yanagihara, scripts for a screen adaptation of the hit novel have been rejected by numerous networks, streaming services and studios, with some network executives even requesting that she make the harrowing story “more like Sex and the City”. Yanagihara said she started working on scripts for a 12-part show with three other co-writers four years ago. They created four different scrips for the first four episodes of the series and detailed outlines for a further eight episodes. But after getting a commission from the streaming service Hulu, it was not picked up and, she told the Observer, “since then it’s been pretty much rejected by everyone”. Since its publication in 2015, A Little Life, which tells the story of university friends Jude, Malcolm, Willem and JB, and tackles trauma, abuse and suicide, has sold more than a million copies, been shortlisted for the Booker prizez, declared a modern-day classic, and adapted into a four-hour play by the acclaimed director Ivo van Hove. But Yanagihara, whose latest novel To Paradise has been compared to Tolstoy, said her attempts to create a screen version have led to rejections in both the US and the UK. She blames her $60m budget and requirement to have creative control, as well as “discomfort with the subject matter”. “I have heard a couple of people say that they wanted it to be like Sex and the City – network executives – which really makes me worried,” she said. “Because there are other ways to crack this book and to interpret it and to bring it to screen.” In 2016 A Little Life was optioned by producer Scott Rudin and theatre director Joe Mantello but it was mutually ended the following year. Out of loyalty to its fans, she refuses to sell a version of the show that does not have her approval. “This instinct that sometimes happens in Hollywood where you buy something and then make it into something else, I do feel that I would owe the readers and the fans of this book something, and it would not be just to sell it for the sake of selling it, and to have it made into something completely unrecognisable that betrays the themes and the tone of the book,” she said. While she wasn’t shocked by the television industry’s response, she was surprised because, although it may not have the mass appeal of Game of Thrones, she believes it would attract a strong global audience. “I do think that it has a real earned audience and that it could really find an international audience as well,” she said. “But yes, it is not going to be a show for everyone. And in America we’re simultaneously at a point where there’s more content than ever needed and yet people are being also more careful about what they invest in.” She worked on the 12 episodes with playwrights-turned-TV writers in key roles. Her collaborators recommended that she cast British actors, advising her that their classical training would keep them true to the script, that they were more affordable and not precious about nudity. “It was kind of a joke but they also meant it,” she said. “They had worked with a lot of British actors and they knew that they would have the sort of fearlessness to tackle the roles as we wrote them.” The series would be filmed in New York, use some CGI to portray moments imagined by Jude, the lead character, and take some inspiration from van Hove’s stage adaptation. “Instead of just being a literal translation, it should be an interpretation and one that used the medium to its greatest investability. So we thought a lot about that, about how to actually visualise it and animate it and make it earn its place as a TV show.” As well as hair, makeup and costumes, it would use light and colour to demonstrate the passing of time, she said. She also wants it to have the pace of a mystery or a thriller. “So in the first part of the series, the question would be ‘what happened to Jude?’, and the second part would be ‘will he survive it?’” She said the “spectacular” stage production, which had its world premiere in Amsterdam in 2018, will be performed for the first time in the UK at the Edinburgh international festival in August before going to New York. As Yanagihara toured the UK last week to promote To Paradise, she said she was struck by the enthusiasm and the youth of readers. “To hear people say in the signing line that they grew up with A Little Life makes me feel very old but it also is a reminder that once the book is published it isn’t your own any more, it becomes the readers’. “And if you’re very lucky, as I have been, then a different group of readers finds the book and makes it their own and gives it a different life. And it’s been humbling to see and an honour and a real pleasant surprise too.”",Arts/Books,The best TV series never made?

2/27/2022,"In Legacy (2019), Thomas Harding wrote about the catering giant J Lyons & Co – founded in 1884 and run by the author’s maternal family as a spin-off from their tobacco company – and acknowledged how his ancestors, like others involved in the tobacco industry at that time, had grown wealthy at the expense of enslaved African labour. The following summer, in 2020, confronted by news images of the slave owner Edward Colston’s statue being toppled in Bristol (part of a global response to the death of George Floyd), he started to see how the earlier gap in his own awareness belonged to a wider “national amnesia” that was being called out by the Black Lives Matter protests. “As a child,” he reflects, “I was taught that Britain had been the first nation to abolish slavery… that we were the ‘good guys’.” Stirred by the protests, Harding was inspired to “find out something more” about Britain’s history and culpability. White Debt: The Demerara Uprising and Britain’s Legacy of Slavery is the fruit of that endeavour, and puts Harding alongside other recent revisers of Britain’s imperial history, including Sathnam Sanghera (Empireland), Kehinde Andrews (The New Age of Empire) and Corinne Fowler (Green Unpleasant Land). Harding focuses on a single event; the 1823 uprising in Demerara, now Guyana – “an example,” he writes, “that captured what British slavery was like in a microcosm” and that takes him on a journey into the past and also to present-day Guyana in search of what its history has left behind. The story unfolds through the eyes of four key characters (all men): John Gladstone, the owner (and slave owner) of a small sugar plantation called Success (whose fourth son would grow up to be the liberal reformist and four-term prime minister, William Ewart Gladstone); the rebel ringleader and enslaved man, Jack Gladstone, who bore their family name and sought to overthrow them; John Smith, the Anglican missionary subsequently dubbed the “Demerara martyr”, who was court martialed for stirring up abolitionist sentiment among the enslaved people, found guilty and subsequently died in mysterious circumstances while in custody; and John Cheveley, a twentysomething colonial administrator, who was an eyewitness to the revolt and its fallout, which caused, according to Harding, a reinvigoration of the anti-slavery movement in Britain, propped up by the scandal of Smith’s death abroad. Overstatement of the role of British humanitarians, including William Wilberforce, Thomas Fowell Buxton, Elizabeth Pease and Anne Knight, in bringing about the end of slavery has long been challenged by scholars such as Eric Williams (also Trinidad and Tobago’s first prime minister), who in Capitalism and Slavery (1944) argued that abolition was more a response to the economic collapse of the plantation system, and by CLR James, who in his study of the Haitian revolution, The Black Jacobins (1938), argued for the key role of enslaved populations themselves in weakening the hand of slavers by rising up against them. Harding’s historiography provides a valuable introduction to the various strands of this debate and to these canonical texts that readers keen, like him, to find out more should engage with directly. He also makes a strong case for the inclusion of Demerara in a list of the key rebellions – typically identified as Haiti (1791-1804), Barbados (1816) and Jamaica (1831-32) – that helped to bring about an end to British slavery. Less successful is the book’s dramatic portrait of characters and political intrigue, which presumably aims to deliver a yarn comparable with works such as William Dalrymple’s magisterial treatment of the 1857 Indian mutiny, The Last Mughal (2006), but lacks that book’s richness and complexity. The more convincing emotional pulse of the book resonates in the brief autobiographical notes, interspersed between the chapters, that describe conversations, first in the UK, then over the course of a research trip to Guyana, with the descendants of enslaved people – Black people – who it would have been to good to hear more from, as they open Harding’s eyes to the enduring legacies of slavery on both sides of the Atlantic. He is initiated into the effects of poverty, mass incarceration and social immobility, all understood by the end of the book as consequences of the transatlantic slave trade, and as a consequence he starts to grasp the case for reparations for slavery, emerging as a passionate advocate. There is, though, a vital omission in his account; nearly 80% of Guyana’s population now live on the frontlines of climate breakdown – the product of a global industrial system, also built from the gains of slavery, that has left post-plantation economies across the Caribbean catastrophically exposed to the impacts of global heating, rising sea levels and increasingly frequent extreme weather events. Failure to acknowledge this present violence makes his case for reparations, though admirable and well intentioned, incomplete.

2/27/2022,"Plans to strip people of British citizenship without prior warning are against British values and would render people from ethnic minorities second-class citizens, senior peers have warned. Clause 9 of the nationality and borders bill, which exempts the government from having to give notice if it is not “reasonably practicable” to do so, or in the interests of national security, diplomatic relations or otherwise in the public interest, has attracted heavy criticism and protests outside parliament. Amendments tabled by the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, Lord Anderson, after discussions with the government, will reduce the circumstances in which notice can be withheld and introduce safeguards – but some peers say they do not go far enough. In a letter sent to the justice minister, Lady Williams, ahead of the report stage in the House of Lords, which begins on Monday, the Conservative peers Sayeeda Warsi and Nosheena Mubarik and the crossbench peer Frances D’Souza say: “Clause 9 would create a secret power of citizenship deprivation without appeal. Far from protecting the public, this gravely threatens cherished British values of fair play and the rule of law that make UK citizenship so prized around the world. “We also risk leaving ethnic minority communities feeling second-class citizens.” The peers say that even after the amendments, the clause would still have retrospective effect and treat past deprivations of citizenship “as if they were lawful, even where courts have found they failed to comply with statute at the time they were made”. Last month, the court of appeal upheld a high court ruling that the government acted unlawfully when it stripped a British woman in a Syrian refugee camp of her citizenship without telling her. The peers write: “If she wishes, the home secretary can simply reissue the deprivation orders that were invalid because they were made unlawfully. Instead, the government aims to enact the legal fiction that they were always valid. It is manifestly unjust to unlawfully strip someone of all the rights that come with British citizenship, without even providing them notice, and then make that decision lawful years later by legislative fiat.” Powers to remove British citizenship in certain cases are longstanding but have been incrementally broadened this century, in 2003, 2006 and 2014, and their use accelerated under Theresa May’s tenure as home secretary from 2010. While UK governments have cited the need to fight terrorism, allies such as the US have warned that stripping individuals of citizenship is not an effective means of doing so. The letter says citizenship “is not like a driving licence or library card. It is something of profound importance that shapes the very lives we lead. Citizenship-deprivation powers already create a two-tiered system of citizenship, with ethnic minority communities eight times more likely to be vulnerable to being deprived of their nationality than those who are white”. A Home Office spokesperson said the right to appeal remains unaffected, adding: “This change in the bill is simply about the process of notification and recognises that in exceptional circumstances, such as when someone is in a war zone, or informing them would reveal sensitive intelligence sources, it may not be possible to do this.”",News/Politics,Lords criticise plans to remove UK citizenship without warning,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/27/lords-criticise-plans-to-remove-uk-citizenship-without-warning
2/27/2022,"Rugby’s head injury protocols have come in for renewed criticism after England’s 23-19 Six Nations victory over Wales on Saturday, with the player welfare group Progressive Rugby highlighting what it calls “systematic failures” in the process. In the 19th minute at Twickenham two Welsh players, Tomas Francis and Owen Watkin, were involved with a collision with England’s Charlie Ewels as he charged for the try-line. The contact left Francis in particular showing signs of concussion. He was clearly dazed, and suffering with ataxia, symptoms that, according to World Rugby’s protocol, require a player to be immediately and permanently, removed from the game. But he played on. The lobby group Progressive Rugby, a group of current and former players, medics, coaches, and researchers who are campaigning for improvements in player welfare, have sent an open letter to World Rugby, the Wales Rugby Union, and the Six Nations about the incident. “Progressive Rugby have contacted the WRU, WR and Six Nations in relation to what we regard as systematic failures in dealing with the welfare of Welsh prop Tomas Francis during England v Wales,” said a spokesman for the group. “In our view, Francis clearly presented symptoms that required his immediate and permanent removal, and that employing the Head Injury Assessment process, from which the player subsequently returned, was a clear breach of World Rugby’s HIA protocol.” Watkin, who was left bleeding heavily from a cut on his brow, went off to have the wound treated, and came back on 10 minutes later. A player requiring a head injury assessment (HIA) is meant to be off for a minimum of 12 minutes. Francis initially stayed on, and was about to take his place in the front row of the ensuing scrum, when referee Mike Adamson sent him for a HIA, which he passed. Both men were then substituted in the second half. But Francis shouldn’t have required an HIA at all. He fell once while trying to regain his feet after contact, held his head, then stumbled again and slumped into the post for support. World Rugby calls those “criteria 1 indicators”. If either the Welsh team doctor or the independent match day doctor (MDD) spotted them, Francis could, and should, have been immediately removed from play. The only way Francis should have ended up needing an HIA is if the two doctors disagreed (given the video footage, it wasn’t clear what they could have disagreed on). And even if Francis had passed the HIA, the MDD had the right to insist that Francis stayed off regardless. It was clear that, on this occasion, the system didn’t work as it is supposed to. World Rugby’s own research shows that 20% of players who have criteria 1 symptoms will still pass the assessment, which means, in their words, that the “the presence of a Criteria 1 sign is, sometimes, the sole indicator for diagnosing concussion, and that “many of the delayed concussions we see are in fact missed or misinterpreted Criteria 1 cases”. After the match, head coach Wayne Pivac said the players “go through some testing behind the scenes, and they both passed the testing so they’re allowed to play on.” Francis shouldn’t have had the opportunity. It’s not the first time he has been involved in an incident like this. Last year the former Dragons forward Adam Hughes, who retired because of brain injury, said he had given Francis “a bit of a telling off” about an incident in Wales’s match against Ireland, when Francis was hit in the head by Peter O’Mahony, but played on without having an HIA. “But it’s not him I should be telling off,“ Hughes said, ”it’s the physios, referees, and independents [doctors].” Progressive Rugby’s letter says “we consider the above incident demonstrates a clear flagrant breach of HIA protocol that potentially puts both the short-term and long-term health of an elite athlete at risk. It is our major concern that the public has observed that in Rugby Union individuals have incurred brain injury and been permitted to continue to play. Until satisfactory explanations are provided, we remain unable to accept World Rugby’s assertion that player welfare is the game’s number one priority.” They also point out that they are still waiting for the results of similar failures during England’s match against Italy on February 13, and England U20s match two days earlier.",Sport/Sport,Rugby’s head injury protocols in spotlight after England’s win over Wales,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/27/six-nations-rugby-union-wales-england-twickenham-head-injury-protocol-tomas-francis
2/27/2022,"Liz Truss has said she would support Britons wanting to go to Ukraine to help it fight the Russian invasion. In an interview on the BBC One’s Sunday Morning programme, the UK foreign secretary replied “absolutely” when asked whether she would back anyone wanting to volunteer to help the Ukrainians fighting for their freedom. She told the programme: “That is something people can make their own decisions about. The people of Ukraine are fighting for freedom and democracy, not just for Ukraine but for the whole of Europe. “Absolutely, if people want to support that struggle I would support them in doing that.” Until now there has been almost no evidence of foreigners going to Ukraine to join the battle against the Russian invasion. But on Sunday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he would be setting up an international legion for volunteers. Zelenskiy, who has won praise around the world for his refusal to flee his capital and the way in which he has inspired his people in the face of Russian aggression, said: “This will be the key evidence of your support for our country.” Zelenskiy’s proposal seems to be modelled on the international brigades formed in the 1930s to enable foreign volunteers to travel to Spain to support the anti-fascist forces in the civil war. About 4,000 Britons volunteered, including the novelist George Orwell. Truss’s comment came as a surprise to many because, although support for Ukraine in the UK is high, there is uncertainty about the legality of going abroad to join a foreign war. The Foreign Enlistment Act 1870 says that it is illegal to enlist in a foreign army at war with a country at peace with the UK. Britons volunteering in the Spanish civil war were threatened with prosecution under this act, but it was deemed unworkable and never used. More recently, in 2014, the CPS warned that Britons travelling to Syria to join the civil war risked prosecution, even if they were fighting against the dicatator Bashar al-Assad.",News/World news,Truss says she would back Britons going to Ukraine to fight Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/liz-truss-says-she-would-back-britons-going-to-ukraine-to-fight-russia
2/27/2022,"Ever since 1945, when George Orwell published his anthropomorphised farmyard allegory of the Russian revolution and Soviet slide into totalitarianism, it has felt newly relevant in whichever era it is revived, not least our own of contested truths and lies. But it speaks especially loudly in a week when Vladimir Putin risks being confirmed as Russia’s latter-day Napoleon – the pugnacious boar and autocratic leader of Animal Farm. Robert Icke adapts and directs this startlingly handsome production, its story enacted mostly through puppets designed by Toby Olié of War Horse fame. There are fluttering pigeons, squabbling hens, muscular horses, characterful geese and of course the thuggish pigs, Napoleon, Snowball and Squealer, who come to be the “more equal” animals on the farm, and who have big, sinister faces. Several puppets are delightfully oversized but with miniature doubles, such as the heroic cart-horse Boxer, who is formidable in his main incarnation, manipulated by three puppeteers, while there is also a dinky, scaled-down version of him that occasionally enters the action to beguiling effect. Puppeteers (14 in total) crouch or wrap themselves around these animals with incredible nimbleness, while the animals’ words are voiced by 10 actors including Juliet Stevenson and Robert Glenister. The only human character on stage is farmer Jones (Jonathan Dryden Taylor), who is not the careless drunk of Orwell’s book but a crueller caricature. There are some breathtaking scenes of puppets giving chase, and of two central battles between animals and humans, and a particularly magnificent moment when Boxer bursts out of the barn to defeat the farmers. The stagecraft also contains plenty of thrills and spills: there is a beautifully orchestrated blackness across Bunny Christie’s almost empty set, which captures the danger and darkness on the farm. Its corrugated iron panels, meanwhile, hint at a rusting dystopia. The black-and-white palette – the white of the animals against the black of the set – brings noirish visual melodrama and the sound design (by Tom Gibbons) adds to it, with its vigorously thumping bass and arch orchestral accompaniments. Together with the lighting design (by Jon Clark), it contains flecks of kabuki – tightly focused movements to the beat of a drum-like note – and high-octane, Indiana Jones-style action adventure. It excels at staging a welter of violence without resorting to any visible blood and gore. But for all these phenomenal achievements, there is not always a palpable sense of fear or menace on the farm, and maybe not enough character development. Napoleon (inspired by Stalin) is a gruff character but never becomes truly frightening, and where the book gives these animals inner lives and personalities, here those are briefly gestured at, sometimes in broad-brush ways. There are attempts to draw us closer but the failings show just how tricky a story this is to stage. There is an emotional flatness and the focus is on action – making it more amenable to a young audience, although the violence may be too adult. Napoleon’s ruthless betrayal of Boxer is not as tragic as it should be, partly because the latter’s story does not feel individuated or intimate enough. We do not really see him for the heart-wrenchingly loyal comrade he is, accepting Napoleon’s ideology without question. Here he is simply a hard-working presence, and his final scene is not given enough space and does not tug at our heartstrings. But what the production does not bring in its emotional effects it makes up for in exhilarating spectacle, imagination, energy, and the absolute glory of its puppetry.

2/27/2022,"The letters UCS, so firmly affirmed in the title, stand for Upper Clyde Shipbuilders. This new musical play by Neil Gore celebrates, in Townsend Productions’ trademark popular-theatre style, the UCS work-in of 1971-72. Reacting to the then Tory government’s attempt to liquidate UCS (and bring about mass unemployment) in June 1971, shop stewards took control of the shipyard gates, occupied the yards and declared a work-in. It’s a big story wittily told in word and song and given a vivid, poster-bright presentation, with projections of Soviet-style workers and Tories with faces painted blue, as well as period footage of rallies and speeches (Ruth Darling’s design; graphics and animations by Scarlett Rickard and Jonny Halifax). Surprisingly, given that most of the images and interviews of the time centre around men, we are guided through the events by two young girls. This works well, dramatically. As Aggie and Eddy find their way into this new, grown-up world, they share their experiences with one another and so lead us both into their personal stories and into the wider political picture. Janie Thomson’s bright, sassy, no-nonsense Aggie discovers, through meetings, the power of words to “light up something inside”; she will move from the stock room to become a shop-steward. Eddy (Heather Gourdie) will leave her job as a tracer at the yard to go to art school and, following the death of her asbestos-affected father, will campaign for workers’ compensation. Barely older than their characters, the actors shine under Louise Townsend’s precise direction. UCS also stands for “Unity Creates Strength”. After a year of the work-in, the government was forced to retreat and to agree terms more favourable to the shipyard workers. That was 50 years ago, but the words sung by Aggie and Eddy and addressed to London-based politicians resonate today: “You live far away and don’t give a pin for the life of a working man.” Yes! Yes!

2/27/2022,"Arowdy, wayward Hindi crime drama set in the red light district of 1960s Mumbai, Gangubai Kathiawadi may romanticise its central character – sex worker turned madam turned advocate and campaigner Gangu (Alia Bhatt) – but the film takes a razor blade to the cosier conventions of the melodrama. This is hard-hitting stuff. Gangu is trafficked into prostitution by a man she loved. But within a year in her new life, she realises that she has power. Bidi cigarette dangling from her lip, armed with a bottle of sugarcane alcohol and a cool, appraising gaze that turns grown men into snivelling boys, Gangu is magnetic, an all-too-rare female antihero. And Bhatt is terrific, tearing through the film, her performance gathering momentum, as respect, desire and a certain amount of fear flickers in the eyes of those around her. Loosely based on a real-life woman, featured in the nonfiction book Mafia Queens of Mumbai, this is a broad brushstrokes portrait, but it’s robustly entertaining stuff from director Sanjay Leela Bhansali (Devdas).",Arts/Film,Gangubai Kathiawadi review – gutsy Indian true crime drama,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/27/gangubai-kathiawadi-review-gutsy-indian-true-drama-alia-bhatt
