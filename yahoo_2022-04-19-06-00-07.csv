4/19/2022,"By Nancy Lapid (Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that has yet to be certified by peer review. Omicron infection induces limited immune response Unvaccinated people infected with the Omicron variant are unlikely to develop immune responses that will protect them against other variants of the coronavirus, a new study suggests. Unlike antibodies induced by COVID-19 vaccines or infections with earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants, antibodies induced by the Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants do not neutralize other versions of the virus, researchers found when they analyzed blood samples obtained after Omicron infection. People with Omicron ""breakthrough"" infections after three doses of the mRNA vaccines designed to neutralize earlier versions of the virus had high levels of neutralizing antibodies against the two Omicron variants, although the efficiency was lower than against previous SARS-CoV-2 versions, according to a report undergoing peer review at Nature Portfolio and posted on Research Square. But among those whose immune systems had not been primed to recognize the virus through vaccination or by natural infection, antibodies after Omicron infection ""were very specific for the respective Omicron variant, and we detected almost no neutralizing antibodies targeting non-Omicron virus strains,"" said Karin Stiasny and Judity Aberle of the Medical University of Vienna, Austria in a joint email. BA.2-induced antibodies appeared to be particularly unlikely to defend against any other variant, they added. The study ""emphasizes the importance of booster vaccinations for immune protection."" COVID-19 hospital death rates go up on weekends The average number of global deaths from COVID-19 were 6% higher on weekends compared to weekdays throughout the pandemic, according to statistics reported to the World Health Organization between March 2020 and March 2022. The research, scheduled for presentation this month at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases, found that worldwide there were on average 449 more COVID deaths on weekends than weekdays (8,532 vs 8,083). The highest absolute increase in weekend COVID-19 deaths was in the United States (average 1,483 weekend deaths vs 1,220 weekday deaths), followed by Brazil (1,061 vs 823), the UK (239 vs 215) and Canada (56 v 48 deaths). Only Germany reported significantly fewer average deaths at weekends compared to weekdays. The increase in COVID-19 deaths on weekends may reflect reporting delays, but it also is likely due to hospital staffing levels and other organizational factors, the researchers said in a statement. The data does not take into account patients' individual risk factors, local policies and public health interventions, which could have affected the outcomes. ""Further studies, with detailed clinical data are needed to investigate the drivers of and causes for the risk of death on weekdays and weekends from COVID-19,"" the researchers said in the statement.

4/19/2022,"When Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed he had made a nearly $3 billion investment in Twitter on April 4, not many would have anticipated the soap opera that was about to begin. In a matter of weeks, Musk went from deciding whether or not he would join Twitter’s board to launching a full-blown $43 billion hostile takeover bid to gain control of the company. Twitter’s board members responded to the unwelcome offer on Friday by taking a so-called poison pill designed to prevent the billionaire entrepreneur from completing his takeover—or at least make the whole process less appetizing. The pill, known formally as a limited duration shareholder rights plan, will allow current Twitter shareholders to buy stock at a discounted rate if Musk’s bid is accepted. It’s a move that didn’t sit well with Musk. On Monday, in response to a tweet that argued the Twitter board’s interests aren’t aligned with its shareholders because of a lack of insider ownership, Musk said that if he is able to acquire the company, he will cut board members’ salaries to $0. “Board salary will be $0 if my bid succeeds, so that’s ~$3M/year saved right there,” he wrote. Musk’s tweet about board members’ salaries is yet another sign that his original bid to buy Twitter has transformed into a referendum on the company. Musk has criticized the board’s low level of ownership in several recent tweets. “Objectively, their economic interests are simply not aligned with shareholders,” he wrote on Saturday. And the Tesla CEO isn’t alone. Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey has also been vocal about his growing distaste for his company’s board. On Saturday, the former CEO said the board has “consistently been the dysfunction of the company” in response to a thread from Garry Tan, cofounder of VC firm Initialized Capital, describing the “plots and coups” that went on during the early days of the company. Dorsey also responded to a tweet that quoted venture capitalist Fred Destin’s critique of corporate boards: “Good boards don’t create good companies, but a bad board will kill a company every time.” “Big facts,” the Block CEO wrote. The board’s move to take a poison pill even led Musk to publicly question whether it should be involved in the process of deciding who can acquire the company at all. Last Thursday Musk tweeted a poll that said: “Taking Twitter private at $54.20 should be up to shareholders, not the board?” A whopping 83.5% of respondents said yes, illustrating the growing anti-board sentiment among Musk’s faithful following. On Monday, the billionaire hinted at a possible tender offer to Twitter shareholders in response—a public request to buy stock directly from them. That could enable Musk to get around the board’s unwillingness to sell the company. It’s just another move in the “game of high stakes poker between Musk and Twitter’s Board,” which could last up to 18 months, if history is any guide, Wedbush’s Dan Ives said in a note this weekend.
