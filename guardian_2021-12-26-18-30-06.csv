12/26/2021,"The system for taking control of a person’s financial affairs is “wide open” to fraud, an investigation has found. It revealed that the application process for obtaining the document known as lasting power of attorney (LPA) has no routine identity checks or effective fraud controls. Labour said it was a “national scandal” and called for an urgent inquiry. The scheme is intended to help manage the affairs of those who are vulnerable or seriously ill. The stamped paper documents can be checked by organisations such as banks and investment firms against a national register.  But lawyers warned that a fraudster could submit a “complete work of fiction” to the government body overseeing the scheme, with falsified names and addresses, and be handed the legal document entitling them to take over the affairs of the victim. An investigation by the BBC Radio 4 consumer programme You and Yours has spoken to one victim whose empty home was targeted by a fraudster or fraudsters who obtained an LPA without any proper checks. The fraudsters briefly visited the woman’s flat to drill out the locks and then tried to sell it using the document. This weekend, Steve Reed, the shadow justice secretary, called for an inquiry into the scheme, which is overseen by the government agency the Office of the Public Guardian. He has also written to Dominic Raab, the secretary of state for justice, urging action. He said: “Every single one of us should be worried sick about the immense risks involved in this. It is a national scandal.” The lasting power of attorney was introduced in 2007, but its operation is based on decades of case law. A document can give the holder access to a person’s bank accounts, investments and savings, but there are no routine fraud or identity checks. It can also be used to sell a house. There are estimated to be about 3m such documents in the official registry. It can take up to 40 days for an application for a Lasting Power of Attorney to be registered, and it costs £82. In the case identified by You and Yours, the fraudster successfully obtained the LPA using falsified names and addresses. The victim’s signature was forged, and the date of birth for the victim was incorrect. The fraud was foiled when lawyers who had been approached to handle the flat sale asked for a doctor’s note confirming that the victim was not well enough to deal with the matter. The victim was then informed last June that a suspected fraudster had tried to sell her home, using the official LPA document and claiming to be a sister. The victim is an only child. The fraudster is believed to have targeted the victim’s home because it was empty while she was away to look after her mother. When the victim complained to the Office of the Public Guardian, she was shocked to be advised on at least two separate occasions by the government agency that the fastest way to resolve the matter would be to say that she had allowed the fraudster to take over her financial affairs, and then to ask for the lasting power of attorney to be revoked. Shari Vahl, a reporter for You and Yours, said that the lasting power of attorney system was “wide open” to fraud. She said: “This is probably the most powerful document in anyone’s financial life. Once someone has this document, they have control of your money. And they are being given out without any checks.” The investigation established that a person with the same name as the fraudster had made various applications to local councils, asking for the addresses of known empty properties. It suggests that other properties may be at risk from a similar fraud. Samantha Hamilton, who heads the Court of Protection team at the legal firm Mullis and Peake, said that routine identity checks should be required for such a powerful document. She said: “You could put in a complete work of fiction at the moment and still have the document registered.” The annual report of the Office of the Public Guardian for 2020-21 warns of the risk that the “weakness in the current process allows the registration of a fraudulent [lasting power of attorney].” It says less than 0.1% of registrations are suspected to be fraudulent. There were more than 680,000 successful LPA applications in 2020-21. Officials say that the current scheme requires documents to be signed by witnesses, and that when the agency becomes aware of fraud, it informs the police and cancels the LPA. It says that the advice given to the victim in the You and Yours case was given in error and that the staff involved have been retrained. An Office of the Public Guardian spokesperson said: “Abuse of lasting power of attorney is extremely rare but we intend to introduce more safeguards against fraud and misuse.” The Ministry of Justice has recently completed a consultation on proposals to modernise LPAs aimed at making the system more secure. This includes proposals for better identity checks. The You and Yours investigation is on Radio 4 on 27 December at 12.18pm and will also be available on BBC Sounds.",Lifestyle/Money,Fraudsters are using power-of-attorney rules to steal people’s homes,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/dec/26/fraudsters-are-using-power-of-attorney-rules-to-steal-peoples-homes
12/26/2021,"Londoners bought more than 112,000 homes outside the capital this year –in the biggest “great escape” from the capital since 2007 as the coronavirus pandemic drove people to seek more space to comfortably work from home. The number of homes bought by Londoners outside the capital increased by 62% compared with 2020 and is the equivalent of creating two new cities roughly the size of Leeds, according to estate agent Hamptons.  Aneisha Beveridge, the firm’s head of research, said: “City leavers have changed the geography of not only the commuter belt, but smaller towns and cities across southern England.” Beveridge said that while most (57%) of those leaving London were selling a home in the capital and buying a new one elsewhere, a record number of London renters were buying their first home in a more affordable location. “The rise of flexible working coupled with affordability barriers have meant that a record 40% of first-time buyers now leave the capital to buy their first home,” she said. “The capital’s loss is the home counties’ gain with these buyers prepared to move 24% further than before the pandemic began, taking their wealth and experience with them.” The research shows that the switch to flexible working has encouraged Londoners to buy homes further outside the capital than in pre-pandemic times. The average London leaver moved 34.7 miles away from Charing Cross (used as the marker for the centre of the capital) – 6.4 miles (or 23%) further than previously. Alice Fry, a public relations consultant, and her husband Ed, a finance director, and their three-year-old and seven-month-old children, Willa and Cressida, joined the exodus, moving from a two-bedroom flat in South Kensington to a six-bedroom Georgian house in Arundel, West Sussex. Fry said the family had planned to move out of London “in theory” in a few years time when Willa would be starting school, but the pandemic accelerated their plan. “After spending three months of the first lockdown at my parents’ house in Sussex, we realised that the way of life is just much better, especially for children,” she said. “So we shifted the house search out of London to the country, and then I found out I was pregnant again, and we were definitely moving out of London. “We got a lot more for our money. We weren’t looking for acres and acres of land, but we have got a nice big garden and the countryside on our doorstep.” The family visits London often, but Fry said lockdown had taught them that more space, a garden and easy access to wide open natural spaces is “more important to us than the buzz of the big city”. “We love London so much – the convenience, and all the excitement that comes with it – but the quality of life is just much better here and we can get to London in no time and enjoy it for its best bits without having to live with its worse bits.” The departing Londoners have bought 112,780 homes outside the capital, so far this year, up from 69,810 in 2020. They spent £54.9bn, the highest annual spend on record and more than double that London leavers spent in 2015. The big increase in total spending reflects soaring property prices, which have been lifted by the government’s temporary cut to stamp duty. The average UK house price has risen from £450,460 in 2020 to £486,890 in 2021. Henry Pryor, an independent property buying agent who has helped find properties for many Londoners leaving the capital this year, said: “It’s no surprise that the housing market has been on fire this year – cheap and easy money has rained down on those with a good enough credit rating to qualify. “Covid has made most people reappraise what they want from a home. We now want our homes to do more – we need them to be places we can work from, that can be converted into home schools, that have flexible spaces if one of us needs to isolate, that has outdoor areas in case we can only see family and friends outside and that has recreational space in case we have to spend our holidays in them. “Many people don’t need to be so close to their work and commutes can be longer and coincidently we want better services like faster broadband to make these homes work better.",News/Society,"Tired of life?

12/26/2021,"Around this time of year it’s not easy to write about chocolate. People are either surrounded by it, or making a plan in the diary to avoid it. So this week we’ll talk small bites. One of the things I’ve noticed is, because I have to test chocolate very regularly, I do ration how much I eat and this does, perversely, augment the experience. Gone – or rare – are the days when I would wolf down a whole bar. Unless it’s a tiny one.  I’m very fond of Green & Black’s Tasting Collection (£12.99, 24 x 15g mini bars), although there are never quite enough of the bars I like. There is something wonderfully complete about starting and finishing the whole, tiny bar. Although not individually wrapped, Neary Nógs Irish stout chocolate cups (£6.25 for 4) are deeply satisfying. Small batch craft chocolate – this one is 63% dark Togo cacao – contains a Guinness ganache and is topped with Irish cream. Delicious. If you like to avoid dairy then look for their Irish sea-salt chocolate caramel cups(£5.25 for 4) – 60% Ecuadorian chocolate and vegan caramel. But my absolute favourite small bites at the moment are Friis Holm’s tiny 5g bars. These delicious Danish babies are not overly easy to get, but I have used my power for good and they are now stocked by Cocoa Runners for £9.45. My favourite is the close to perfect 50% O’Payo Milk. I could buy a whole 100g bar, of course, for £9.95, and there’s a hazelnut version, but therein lies danger. Stay small and stay safe.

12/26/2021,"Idon’t remember a time in my life when I was not afraid of swans. It’s not that I think a swan could kill me, but I’m pretty sure it could dislocate my shoulder. Or at the very least peck me somewhere nasty. All I know is this: I don’t want to find out what they’re capable of. For me, I imagine it feels much like any other phobia must feel for other people: a perfectly natural and rational reaction to something completely terrifying. Being afraid of swans was not really an issue in my life until I started swimming outdoors during the lockdowns last year. My swan anxiety is well publicised among the group I swim with. Everyone is cautious around nesting birds between March and June, but someone will come and swim next to me if there’s a swan in the vicinity all year round. I’m also a figure of well-intentioned ridicule. For my birthday, friends put on a surprise rendition of Swan Lake in a shallow stretch of the Thames in Surrey, complete with tutus, white face paint and feathered headbands.  Lately, I’ve had a few hairy moments. There are “friendly” swans at one lake we go to and, as they glide over, my breathing turns shallow and I can feel myself physically shutting down. A while ago, I realised that my jitters risk exposing me to other dangers: swimming out further than I want to, or being longer in the cold than is sensible, or having a panic attack in the water. It also occurred to me that I’m exposing others to unnecessary stress: their job is to keep themselves safe in the water, not to look after me. I needed to get this phobia under control. My fear – like many fears – is not completely groundless. As a child, I worshipped my grandad, a gentle but strong man who had been a bantamweight boxer during his time in the RAF. When I was about five or six, we were walking alongside a riverbank in a family group. Out of nowhere my grandad, just ahead of us, was accosted by a swan protecting her babies. He must have brushed past the nest. All the adults around me laughed it off, as he was never in any real danger, but I had seen the shock flash in his eyes: this creature was not to be messed with. The thing I remember most is the effect of its gigantic, deafening wing span. It was monstrous. The message for me was clear: avoid the wrath of the swan. You cannot fight it and you cannot outrun it. The swan didn’t get him on that day. But it could get me now. The only way I could think of overcoming my kyknophobia responsibly – seeing as there is no official “Embrace the Swan” treatment programme – was to enlist the help of Steve Knight, who runs the Swan Sanctuary in Shepperton, Surrey, near the stretches of the Thames where I swim regularly. Knight’s late partner, Dot Beeson, started rescuing swans and tending to them in her garden in the early 1980s. She sold her house to finance the first national swan sanctuary on a hectare of land in Egham, eventually moving operations to Shepperton in 2005. Beeson was awarded an MBE for her services to swan rescue and rehabilitation in 2015. Since she died of cancer last year, at the age of 72, Knight has taken on her mantle as (my name for him) “the swan whisperer”. We cannot meet at the Swan Sanctuary itself because of recent precautions around avian flu; dozens of swans died after an outbreak in Stratford-upon-Avon in early November. So we meet instead at Truss’s Island, Staines, a place where flocks of swans regularly gather. We both know some people who swim here, but this is exactly the kind of swim spot I would usually avoid. I take my swim buddy John for moral support (and because, in any case, none of us ever swim alone). Knight is sympathetic about my phobia but he also thinks I am silly: “There are far greater dangers in the water than the swans.” He’s right, of course. More importantly, the swans themselves are in far greater danger than I am. The sanctuary has recently taken in several swans with sewage poisoning. If it’s not sewage then it’s diesel. And now another round of this bird flu. I kind of knew all this, but I had blocked out the real impact. Hearing it face to face, from someone who devotes their time to saving wildlife, finally makes me take in the horror of it. The actual plight of these creatures is far more profound than my imaginary one. However, the reality is that I am still terrified. Armed with a loaf of bread, Knight guides me gently towards a group of what must be two dozen swans. He recommends feeding swans at this time of year as their natural food is scarce during winter. But you should always feed them in the water or near the water’s edge so that they’re not tempted to roam towards traffic or dogs. In my mind, there are hundreds of swans, maybe millions, and I am Tippi Hedren in The Birds. But there is something calming about Knight’s presence and, when one swan doesn’t want to move out of his way, he calmly grasps it by the neck like a python and moves it firmly aside. All the swans are brushing up against us, snorting like pigs (“They are just saying hello,” Knight says). I realise to my amazement that they are not crazed maniacs – even though they are quite hungry and really want the bread – and they are not actually attacking us. After a while, I do almost get pecked – by accident, I think – but even that is not as frightening as I thought it would be. I can feel an undercurrent of panic from a part of my brain I can’t quite switch off: “DANGER. SWANS.” But I can also see the truth of the situation: I am not in physical danger. I am hugely inspired and impressed by how calm Knight is. I don’t want to get too Freudian about this, but I realise later that he is not unlike my grandad in his manner. Something shifts. I remember the words of my swim friend Debbie, an occupational therapist who is not remotely afraid of swans, despite having had a few incidents that involved “circling” during nesting season. “I’m really frightened of a lot of animals. But with birds, I know they are more afraid of us than we are of them. You just have to do everything you can to make sure they don’t think you’re a threat. Don’t look at the cygnets. Don’t make eye contact.” Knight echoes this: “Stay calm. Be relaxed. Breathe. Don’t move away too quickly because you mark yourself out as prey.” Good advice. No one wants to feel like prey. Ahead of me, I see John walk carefully into the water, surrounded by long white necks. He splashes very slightly as he launches off and a swan backs away, frightened. They really are the prey and not us. Astonishingly, after the Hitchcockian immersion therapy, it feels like I really believe this. My fear has not lifted. But it has muted into watchful respect. Now I just have to figure out what to do about seagulls.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Escape your comfort zone: I love swimming outdoors – so I decided to confront my deep fear of swans,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/26/escape-your-comfort-zone-i-love-swimming-outdoors-so-i-decided-to-confront-my-deep-fear-of-swans
12/26/2021,"As cinemas once again struggled with the closures, cancellations and uncertainties of the pandemic, the biggest film story this year was surely the long-delayed release of No Time to Die. Originally slated to open in early 2020, Daniel Craig’s final outing as 007 became the first high-profile release to announce a major Covid-related postponement.  For many UK cinemas, the new November 2020 opening date became a mast to which to tie their hopes of recovery – hopes that were crushed when the release date was pushed back again, to April 2021, and then again to autumn. So when Craig’s Bond swan song was finally unveiled at the Albert Hall at the end of September, the sense of relief was palpable – not least because the film didn’t disappoint. Ably directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga (Beasts of No Nation ), No Time to Die opened to strong reviews and solid box-office – although in yet another indication of how much the world has changed in recent years, a streaming release came hot on the heels of the film’s theatrical debut, meaning that right now, viewers can choose to watch No Time to Die in cinemas or at home: the model of the future. Among the many names that have been mooted to breathe new life into the role of 007, Riz Ahmed is popular with audiences. A versatile actor, musician and writer, he proved his mettle in the 2019 drama Sound of Metal, which opened in UK cinemas in April 2021, just ahead of the Oscars, where he was nominated for best actor (he lost out to Anthony Hopkins in The Father). Ahmed is currently on the Oscar radar again with the short film The Long Goodbye, a terrifying dystopian vision of modern Britain, directed by Aneil Karia, which generated debate in parliament when first released in 2020, and has now been shortlisted for the 94th Academy Awards. At the 93rd Oscars in April, Chloé Zhao, director of the recent Marvel blockbuster Eternals, became only the second woman to win best director, following in the footsteps of Kathryn Bigelow (who won for The Hurt Locker in 2010) with Nomadland, which also won best picture, and best actress for Frances McDormand. At Cannes, French film-maker Julia Ducournau became the second woman to win the Palme d’Or (after Jane Campion), with her extraordinary second feature, Titane, a full-blooded body-horror fable that channels the controversial spirit of David Cronenberg’s Crash, and which opens in the UK today . June saw the UK release of English-Pakistani film-maker Aleem Khan’s brilliant feature debut, After Love, which recently swept the board at the British independent film awards, where its trophies included best British independent film, best director and best screenplay, alongside best actress for Joanna Scanlan. There were significant wins too for the documentary Poly Styrene: I Am a Cliché, which opened here in March, and the for the tense, one-shot drama Boiling Point, starring Stephen Graham, which UK audiences can see from 5 January 2022. The most remarkable film of the summer of 2021 was Summer of Soul, Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson’s rediscovery of footage from the 1969 Harlem Cultural festival, featuring jaw-dropping performances by Nina Simone, Stevie Wonder, Sly and the Family Stone, Mahalia Jackson and more. Then in August, the Welsh film-maker Prano Bailey-Bond took audiences back to the 80s heyday of the video nasties with her thrilling feature debut, Censor. But my favourite film of 2021 was Céline Sciamma’s Petite Maman, a flawless gem from the creator of Girlhood and Portrait of a Lady on Fire. Just 73 minutes long, and rated “suitable for all” by the BBFC, this U-certificate masterpiece reminds us of the universal power of cinema to transform, engage and ultimately redeem audiences, transcending boundaries of age, gender and nationality. 1.

12/26/2021,"In the next 12 months, Britain is expected to make a remarkable aerospace breakthrough. For the first time, a satellite will be fired into orbit from a launch pad in the United Kingdom. It will be a historic moment – though exactly where this grand adventure will begin is not yet clear. A series of fledgling operations, backed by the UK Space Agency, are now competing to be the first to launch a satellite from British soil.  One is based in Cornwall, where a Virgin Orbit jumbo jet is set to carry a LauncherOne rocket to a height of 35,000 feet, where it will then be fired to propel its satellite cargo into orbit. The first flight is scheduled for late summer. By contrast, rival Scottish spaceports – one in Sutherland and one on Shetland – are preparing more direct routes, with each announcing plans to launch two-staged rockets that could put satellites round the Earth in late autumn. In addition, proposals have been announced to build spaceports in Scotland at Campbeltown, Prestwick and North Uist, while Wales’s B2Space, based in Snowdonia, has revealed its own, unusual method for getting into space: by balloon. It plans to release a helium-filled dirigible which will carry a rocket to a height of more than 20 miles. The launcher will then be fired, carrying its satellite cargo into orbit. Some of the remotest parts of the British Isles will soon reverberate to the sound of rocketry and space launches, with the Cornish, Sutherland and Shetland programmes rated as the most likely to see first successes next year. Each of these spaceports has stressed the carbon-friendly, re-usable aspects of its operations and, in general, have received cautious support from most local people. An example is provided by Sutherland Spaceport – which is based on a 12-acre site in the middle of the Melness Crofters‘ Estate on the A’Mhoine peninsula on the very northernmost part of mainland Scotland. Crofters there graze cattle, catch fish and tend the land but have welcomed the £17.5m project that could soon see rockets fired over their remote homeland. “This is not going to be the Cape Canaveral of the Highlands,” said Dorothy Pritchard, chair of Melness Crofters’ Estate. “There will only be a few launches every year. But the spaceport will provide skilled jobs for young people, and that is desperately important here. The oil industry is going, young adults are leaving, and the population around here is ageing. A spaceport will bring a tremendous boost to the area by providing jobs for skilled, educated young folk.” Not everyone has been enthusiastic. Local landowner, the Danish billionaire Anders Povlsen, has claimed the spaceport would harm his plans to rewild the area. Earlier this year, a judicial review threw out a bid by him to have the project blocked, however, and Povlsen has since announced that he will not appeal against the decision. Space Hub Sutherland’s first launch is tipped for late autumn when a Prime rocket – built by Orbex, a UK-based launcher manufacturer – is scheduled to make its maiden flight from the spaceport. Orbex describes its Prime rocket as “one of the most advanced, low-carbon, high-performance micro-launch vehicles in the world”. The spaceport lies on mainland Britain’s remotest corner, though its location looks positively bustling compared with its Shetland rival, SaxaVord Space Port, which is being built at Lamba Ness on Unst, the most northerly inhabited island in the UK, 400 miles north of Edinburgh. Its Pathfinder rockets will be delivered next year. The site, like Sutherland’s, offers special advantages. Many satellites – in particular, Earth monitoring spacecraft that study sea-level fluctuations and ice-sheet changes – often fly in polar orbit round the Earth, on trajectories inclined at 90 degrees to the equator. On orbits like these, the Earth revolves beneath the craft as it sweeps over the poles, allowing it to monitor the entire planet underneath it. So, blasting a rocket northwards, safely over open seas and not over inhabited land, gives spaceports such as Sutherland’s and SaxaVord a key benefit. “What we really have to concentrate on is making sure we have as much flexibility as possible in our operations,” said Scott Hammond, operations director of the Shetland spaceport. “We need to be able to launch fairly big satellites, say 500kg, as well as small ones, down to 10kg, in order to attract as many different customers – who will have varying requirements for the objects that they want to put in space – as possible. And that, precisely, is what our rockets are designed to do.” A different approach is taken by operators at Cornwall’s spaceport. Their satellite launcher will involve no fiery blast-offs but will, instead, be carried aloft, strapped to the underside of Cosmic Girl, a retrofitted 747 jet that is operated by Virgin Orbit and which will take off from Newquay airport. Virgin Orbit has already launched satellites this way, over the Pacific, and has plans to use this spaceport as its European base. “Instead of customers having to take their satellites to a rocket pad to have them blasted into space, Virgin Orbit takes the opposite route – by coming to a site near you to offer a launch,” said Melissa Thorpe, head of Spaceport Cornwall. “It has set up bases round the world, and Cornwall will be the centre of its European operations. That will make it much easier for UK satellite builders to get their craft into orbit.” In total, it is a striking set of launch plans with Britain concentrating on the growing market for launching small satellites, which are usually less than 500kg in weight. “In 2012, there were around 50 launches of small satellites,” said Ian Annett, deputy chief officer of the UK Space Agency, which has played a key role in setting up the nation’s spaceport network. “By 2019, there were more than 400 and the market continues to grow. “It used to cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to put a kilo of material into orbit. However, commercial launching companies – like Elon Musk’s SpaceX – have brought that cost down to nearer $1,000.” Such reductions are opening up low Earth orbit for exploitation by a wide range of users, from single university departments to companies planning to exploit global markets. For example, internet providers such as OneWeb have announced plans to put hundreds of small satellites into orbit to generate global broadband coverage. Others want to use them to study the impacts of climate change, carry out disaster monitoring, manufacture alloys and drugs in microgravity, test new communication technologies and to implement a host of other applications. Small satellites range from the size of an oven to a phone, and can be launched individually or in clusters. It remains to be seen whether the UK’s fledgling space launch industry can attract enough business to keep all seven proposed spaceports busy launching these satellites. At present, however, there is confidence for their prospects. “The market potential is immense, and Britain has a chance to exploit that operation from within its own shores, for the first time,” said Annett.",News/Science,The Great British race to space,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/dec/26/the-great-british-race-to-space
12/26/2021,"Historical biography always involves a certain amount of detective work, but Professor Zoë Playdon has had to contend with an additional challenge in the writing of her first book, The Hidden Case of Ewan Forbes. As the title implies, information about her subject was not just scant, but much had been actively suppressed. Now Playdon’s determined labours have brought this extraordinary story to light. Playdon first came across Sir Ewan Forbes-Sempill in 1996 as the result of advising on a legal challenge to allow transgender people to change their birth certificate – something that had been the norm in the UK until the late 1960s, although it was unclear how or why the law had changed. In the wake of their defeat, they were approached by a solicitor named Terrence Walton, who provided a missing piece of the puzzle.  Walton had represented a trans woman, April Ashley, in a landmark case in 1969. She was a model who had married the Hon Arthur Corbett, but when the relationship broke down and Ashley tried to claim financial support, Corbett took her to court on the grounds that she was male (as recorded on her birth certificate, which she had not changed) and that therefore the marriage had never been legitimate. The case created a precedent that meant a person’s birth certificate was the final word on their legal sex. Walton told Playdon and her colleagues that he and Ashley had been made aware at the time of an earlier case also concerned with establishing an individual’s legal sex, but told they could not refer to it. “All traces of it had been removed from the public eye.” It took Playdon two years and a good deal of persistence to gain access to the 500-page transcript of Sir Ewan’s court case, and it was not until her retirement in 2014 that she was able to devote a further five years of research to his life and historical significance. The result is a detailed and wide-ranging work, piecing together the largely forgotten story of one individual and situating it in a broader context of trans rights, gay rights and the laws of primogeniture over the past century. Sir Ewan’s life is the stuff of costume drama, and it’s no surprise to learn that the television rights have already been sold. He was born in 1912 at Craigievar Castle near Balmoral, the third child of the Lord and Lady Sempill, was registered as female and christened Elisabeth. “But as far as Ewan was concerned,” Playdon writes, “he was a boy, and his certainty about this was so firm that his tranquil memoir, The Aul’ Days, published when he was 72, mentions no other possibility.” His parents seem to have had an ambivalent attitude to their youngest child’s gender. His mother in particular appears surprisingly progressive in some ways; in adolescence, she takes him to European medical specialists for treatments that sound like testosterone injections. But he is still expected to appear in women’s clothes on formal occasions, and to be presented at court as a debutante even after he has developed facial hair. He waited until after his parents’ deaths to change his name and his birth certificate formally so that he could legally marry. At the time, this was “a relatively easy process”, requiring letters from a doctor, though Ewan’s family connections and his own medical career clearly smoothed his path. But in his 50s, Ewan’s quiet life with his wife Patty was thrown into chaos by the death of his older brother, William, the 10th Baronet Forbes of Craigievar. The title was limited by primogeniture; only males could inherit, and William had no sons. At William’s funeral, like the villain in a melodrama, Ewan’s cousin John appeared, claiming his right to the title on the grounds that Ewan was not a man. There followed a legal battle with so many dramatic twists and turns it almost stretches credulity; bribery, sibling rivalry and the sudden death of a key witness is only the half of it. The potential ramifications of the verdict were huge, not only for Sir Ewan, who could have faced two years in prison for perjury, along with Patty, if he was found to be female, but for the future of male succession. “There are some interests that it is more important to protect than the rights of individuals,” as Walton says darkly. As emeritus professor of medical humanities at the University of London and a campaigner with 30 years’ experience in LGBTQ+ rights, Playdon is well placed to examine this story in context and she tells it, as you would expect, from the perspective of her own views on the issues. Ewan Forbes’s story, and the cases that have a bearing on his, are presented with empathy and respect, though at times her strong views can tip her into hyperbole. It is a shame, too, that she feels the need to deploy the derogatory term “Terf” repeatedly throughout her concluding chapter, “Ewan’s Legacy”, which presents selective arguments from the current debate over gender identity. Despite these jarring notes, Playdon has unearthed a fascinating and important story, the impact of which is sure to reverberate through future discussions on trans rights and the rights of daughters to inherit.

12/26/2021,"Manchester United’s Ralf Rangnick has experienced something like a Christmas miracle: from having 11 players in total available last week (including three goalkeepers), he now has an almost fully fit squad to select from, with the sole exception of Paul Pogba. That means 25 outfield players are ready to go, Rangnick said – bad news for Eddie Howe and Newcastle in their hunt for a second Premier League win. In his own pre-match press conference Howe harked back to the eras of Kevin Keegan and Sir Bobby Robson, urging his players to recreate that “attacking verve and swagger”. But those vibrant times seem a long way away, with a relegation dogfight to look forward to in the new year.

12/26/2021,"Once upon a time there was a mouse mat. A mouse mat that threatened to undermine global efforts to avert nuclear warfare. The sales photo on Etsy showed a blameless-looking rubber rectangle, hand made in Leicester, with a Persian rug motif. But PayPal decided that it violated international sanctions and suspended the account of the unsuspecting purchaser. To understand the modern business model – and the contents of my consumer inbox – look no further than this “illicit” item.  A computer algorithm had decided the mat was Iranian contraband, computer software suspended the customer’s PayPal account, automated warnings threatened termination unless the customer could prove its provenance, and customer service agents seemed powerless to apply human logic. It was the same artificial intelligence and human apathy that forced graduates to keep funding repaid loans , informed an Ovo customer that they owed £19,000 for two months of energy and allowed a 10-minute flight schedule change to scupper a honeymoon. Add to the mix this year’s double act, Brexit and Covid, which gave companies two cast-iron new excuses for skirting consumer rights law. As much of the nation retreated to the sofa to work, and Brexit muddied the rule book, the computer was given ever greater control and customers found themselves trapped in limbo. “Kafkaesque nightmare” is a recurring phrase from our literary readers. As always, there are so many worthy contenders for an award, but it’s been a pleasure to narrow them down to the following standout takes on customer service. In all cases, the customer was only offered effective service after I intervened. A joint gong for eBay and delivery firm UPS. When MS of Manchester sought a refund from an eBay seller for a £130 satnav that never arrived, he was refused. eBay sided with the seller, since tracking showed that the item had been delivered – to his rubbish bin. How could UPS have known that, without a notification card, MS would not think to check his wheelie bin before collection day? NS&I tried hard for this honour. It twice informed a grieving man that he had been bequeathed £14,000 from his late sister’s pension plan before realising it had sent the forms to the wrong relative. Then it erroneously told the deceased’s father to expect £19,000. The bequest was, in fact, intended for the grandson who, in proud Scottish tradition, bore the same name, but a different address to his father and grandfather. The comically named “sensitive claims” department discovered it had lost the late woman’s letter of instruction and, in its absence, refused to discuss the legacy with her executors. The UK government sweeps the table. Take your pick. The Department for Work and Pensions misunderstood its own rules and penalised a universal credit claimant for not applying while in an induced coma. The Home Office, whose rules on residency permits are so misleading and whose stance, when applicants are duly misled, so intransigent, that an eligible spouse was denied indefinite leave to remain and presented with a £1,000 bill for NHS services. Or there’s the Ministry of Justice’s multimillion- pound reforms to streamline the probate service. Closure of local probate offices, a new online system declared unfit for purpose by legal firms, and a Covid backlog, have left families in legal limbo for up to nine months. What’s more risky – explosives or footwear? Both score equally, according to courier firm DPD. Its stance makes perfect sense. It allows customers to book a delivery for an identified item, pay extra for insurance cover, and then, if the consignment goes missing and a claim is made, it can duck a payout by declaring it’s on a list of prohibited items along with human flesh and counterfeit currency. Vigilant customers, who study delivery exclusions, may be none the wiser. DPD forbids the mailing of “personal effects”, while Hermes refuses to pay compensation in the event it wrecks or loses “composite items of any description” or “items which can be exchanged by themselves, or with any other item, for money or goods or services”. WK of Cumbria’s purposeful lockdown hours were spent contesting a £111 customs charge on a £12 wall bracket. It had been omitted from a delivery from the German company Loxhome in November 2020, and sent separately in the new year. By then, post-Brexit customs charges had kicked in. The duty for the bracket was applied to the entire £460 order. WK refused delivery to avoid the charges. But courier UPS returned to slip it through his letter box and, by the time the Observer intervened, debt collectors were pursuing him for £115. Meanwhile, a new identity was the Brexit bonus for some startled EU nationals who had been granted EU Settled Status in the UK. A Home Office computer anomaly meant that women who had lived for decades under their married surname, were registered under their birth name which appears first on some EU passports. They faced losing access to services because their proof of residency rights did not match official documents. Holidays! Remember those jaunts to Mediterranean beaches in the old days? While the few who dared set their sights on sunny climes battle for refunds for cancelled trips, many who played safe and booked local are also out of pocket. One reader did get as far as Cornwall, only to discover that the five-star water resort he’d booked had no record of him. Booking.com reassured the family they had been rebooked – in the beguiling suburb of Uxbridge, 250 miles away. Airbnb, meanwhile, decided that lockdowns are not an extenuating circumstance for cancellation and refused to require hosts to refund customers whose trips were banned by government rules, while deducting its 15% service fee from hosts who decided to do the right thing. The high street banks can share this between them for abandoning scam victims to penury. Criminals have again been the biggest Covid winners with increasingly sophisticated strategies to access personal accounts . The good news is, major banks have pledged to refund victims who were not unduly negligent. The bad is, they often try their darnedest to wriggle out of it. I’ve investigated unrefunded losses of £900,000 this year and persuaded banks to return 54%, including a £225,000 pension pot stolen from a retired detective by a cloned investment firm. Nationwide deserves the spotlight for failing to protect, and refusing to refund, a pensioner’s £70,000 life savings, stolen in a similarly sophisticated scam. It finally offered to refund her a year later following contact from the Financial Ombudsman Service.",Lifestyle/Money,And the awards for the worst customer service go to …,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/dec/26/and-the-awards-for-the-worst-customer-service-go-to-
12/26/2021,"Suicidal asylum seekers were subject to force by guards who the Home Office allowed to remain on duty despite being “effectively uncertified” in the safe use of restraint techniques, according to internal documents charting conditions inside one of the UK’s most controversial immigration centres. Experts say the department endangered lives last year by deploying custody staff whose training in the safe use of force had expired, as it detained hundreds of people who had crossed the Channel in a fast-track scheme to remove them.  The cache of 180 documents, obtained through freedom of information laws by the Observer and Liberty Investigates, reveal the desperation of those held at Brook House as the Home Office mounted an intensive programme of flights removing people who had arrived in small boats to mainland Europe. They show that the proportion of detainees subjected to force inside the removal centre near Gatwick airport more than doubled last year. The documents – which include officers’ written accounts, minutes taken during oversight meetings and complaints filed by detainees and staff – also offer a rare insight into allegations of excessive force by staff. Serco, the contractor that took over Brook House in May 2020, said it “completely refutes” the allegations, although it did not specify which claims. The disclosures reveal that after the first lockdown in March 2020, custody officers, who Home Office guidance states should take at least eight hours of training in the safe use of control and restraint techniques every year, were given a “dispensation” allowing them to keep working. “The danger created by staff being overdue for refreshers is the increased risk of death in custody due to staff loss of knowledge and skill,” said Joanne Caffrey, a former police officer of 24 years and an expert witness in the use of force. In normal circumstances more than one person out of date would represent a “significant institutional failure”, she added. Between July and December last year, Brook House was the government’s base for Operation Esparto – a schedule of 22 removal flights under a deportation option that allowed the UK to send people to the first EU country they had entered. The process finished on 31 December with the end of the Brexit transition period. Many detainees are believed to have been survivors of torture and trafficking. Officers used force, including techniques that deliberately cause suffering to gain compliance – called pain-inducing restraint – to prevent self-harm on 62 occasions from July to December. The population of Brook House was about 100 people at any one time. Self-harm attempts clustered around the flights themselves. The day before a charter to France and Germany on 25 August, officers intervened four times, including one in which a man was taken to hospital after being found in a pool of blood with slash wounds to his arms, head and chest. Between August and December, there were 14 attempts by detainees to end their lives using improvised ligatures. Two tried to suffocate themselves using plastic bags. On 21 September, the day before a flight, a man jumped from an upper floor but was caught in safety netting before trying “to push himself through the edge of the netting so he could fall head first to the ground”, officers wrote. One claimed torture survivor who attempted suicide in detention described Brook House as his “worst nightmare”. He said: “I thought at least if I kill myself, they’ll be able to learn a lesson – they’ll listen, and they wouldn’t treat other people the way they treated us.” Serco warned the Home Office during monthly updates that incidents of self-harm linked to the Esparto programme were driving up rates of force. In fact, the proportion of detainees subjected to force by officers rose from between 7% and 8% in 2018 and 2019 to 17% in 2020, according to monitors. Yet the Home Office didn’t release any detainees through the legal mechanism to identify those at risk of suicide despite guidance permitting this. Instead, when training shortages emerged because of Covid-19, it relied on a loophole quietly introduced to keep officers on duty across the immigration estate after their safe use-of-force training had expired. Home Office guidance usually requires custody officers to take at least eight hours of refresher training every year in the safe use of control and restraint techniques – some of which can kill if performed incorrectly. Expired staff “must not work as a [custody officer]” and their certificate is marked “invalid” on a central database, guidance states. In March 2020, the Home Office created a “dispensation,” allowing out-of-date officers to remain operational until the end of September, taking part in any use-of-force incident unless it was “planned”. Documents reveal that officers used force on detainees at Brook House during Operation Esparto while “out of ticket” on at least six occasions. On three of these, the officers were on constant watch duties – a shift during which they monitor a detainee at risk of self-harm or suicide. For example, just after 9pm on 3 August 2020, an asylum seeker – on constant watch after saying he’d rather die than return to France – began head-butting a cell window. The officer monitoring him – who ticked a box in his form stating he had not received refresher training – stepped in to pull the man back. The detainee then picked up a kettle and hit himself on the head with it “multiple times”, internal reports state. The kettle was taken from the man’s grip but he wrapped the power cable around his neck to strangle himself. A second officer grabbed the man’s hand. She then used a technique known as the back hammer, which risks dislocation if used incorrectly. She also ticked a box on her use-of-force report stating she had not received refresher training. When contacted by the Observer, the Home Office did not say whether it carried out a risk assessment of the move, nor how many staff went on duty while expired. “Deploying effectively uncertified officers to use force against detainees just to meet Home Office deportation targets is completely unacceptable,” said Alistair Carmichael, Lib Dem spokesman for home affairs. “Ministers should come before parliament to address these serious allegations.” Disclosures included in the documents revealed other concerning allegations. Documents show how a staff member complained that pain-inducing restraint was used on a detainee to force him to accept an ad-hoc medical assessment after a planned use of force. Serco said that this was done in the detainee’s best interests. The investigation also spoke to a former detainee who complained after officers placed a shield on top of him while he lay, not moving, in bed. Reviewing reports of the incident, Caffrey said force appeared “excessive”, which Serco denies. The Home Office said it reviews reports filled in by officers justifying the techniques they have used. But minutes taken during an oversight meeting in November 2020 warned the paperwork was being filled out incorrectly. The following month, officials said “accuracy” should be addressed. Officers were also found to be writing that they reserved the right to later change their reports, raising fears they could try to attempt to dodge accountability. Serco said the issue occurred in the aftermath of its takeover of Brook House and has since been corrected. A spokesperson for the Home Office said: “We have a range of safeguards in place to protect the vulnerable, including round-the-clock access to healthcare professionals, and contractors are also duty-bound to maintain our safety standards.” But in internal email exchanges, officials appeared to acknowledge that some of the material was controversial. A reporter’s request to see officers’ use-of-force accounts was sent for ministerial clearance, during which one official wrote to another: “I don’t need to see all the forms but pls do send me any that are likely to be contentious.” The reply came: “There are a lot of them that are.” Although not addressing specific allegations in a statement, Sarah Burnett, Serco’s operations director of immigration, said: “We have provided comprehensive evidence to demonstrate the accusations are untrue and there is no evidence to support them, only supposition and incorrect third-party commentary.” Burnett said that since taking over Brook House, Serco had recruited 170 extra staff and established an “open, inclusive culture” where “officers behave professionally and are properly trained and certified notwithstanding the challenges faced during the Covid pandemic”. She added: “Our officers have a duty of care to the people in the centre, and only use appropriate and proportionate force as a last resort, which in many cases prevents self-harm by detainees and on some occasions has saved lives.”",News/UK news,Suicidal asylum-seekers subjected to ‘dangerous’ use of force by guards at detention centre ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/26/suicidal-asylum-seekers-subjected-to-dangerous-use-of-force-by-guards-at-detention-centre
12/26/2021,"Thousands of hopefuls auditioned for the lead role of a blind character in an epic second world war drama series for Netflix that is based on a Pulitzer prize-winning novel. But the producers of All the Light We Cannot See have chosen a student with no formal acting training who is registered blind, in a move that has been welcomed by disability rights activists. Although Aria Mia Loberti has no formal training, her natural ability has led to her being cast in a four-part adaptation of Anthony Doerr’s novel. She will portray Marie-Laure, a blind teenager whose path collides with Werner, a German soldier, as they try to survive the devastation of war in Nazi-occupied France.  The book is being adapted by Steven Knight, the British creator of the Bafta-winning gangster drama Peaky Blinders, whose acclaimed films include Dirty Pretty Things, a thriller about illegal immigrants in London, starring Chiwetel Ejiofor and directed by Stephen Frears. “She did several auditions which are absolutely remarkable,” Knight said. “She’s amazing.” Asked whether such natural acting talent can ever be taught, he replied: “You can perfect it. I don’t think you can learn it. You are born with it. She has got it. So we’ve been very fortunate.” Last weekend, actor Rose Ayling-Ellis captivated audiences in winning Strictly Come Dancing as the competition’s first-ever deaf contestant, proving, as she put it, “that deaf people can do anything”. For Loberti, being cast in such a high-profile production is similarly significant for blind and partially sighted people, for whom she has campaigned. She said: “I have a rare and severe form of a genetic eye condition called achromatopsia. As a result, I’m completely blind in some environments and have minimal, variable residual vision in others.”In the novel, her character says: “When I lost my sight, Werner, people said I was brave. When my father left, people said I was brave. But it is not bravery; I have no choice. I wake up and live my life. Don’t you do the same?” Lauren Appelbaum of RespectAbility, a non-profit organisation dedicated to changing how society views people with disabilities, said: “Netflix is really going to be able to play a role in changing these stigmas surrounding what it means to be blind. Just because you’re blind, it doesn’t mean you can’t be an actress in a major role … It’s not overcoming blindness or in spite of being blind. She just happens to be blind and is going to play this role.” Appelbaum, who herself has a disability, added: “It’s almost impossible to truly portray someone with disability without having that disability. The nuances that you can bring to that role are just going to make that character so much more dynamic. You don’t have the risk of the actor making a mistake that would show that it’s inauthentic casting, which I’ve seen happen time and time again.” The novel became a global phenomenon, selling more than 15m copies after its publication in 2014. In the Observer, Justin Cartwright wrote: “It is easy to understand why Doerr’s book is regarded by many as an epic and a masterpiece.” The New York Times’s critic blamed its author “for lost sleep because once I started reading his new novel … there was no putting it down”. Loberti had been similarly inspired when she decided to audition for the screen adaptation after hearing of the casting search from a former teacher. She is currently a PhD student in rhetoric at Penn State University in Pennsylvania, having received her master’s in ancient rhetoric at Royal Holloway, University of London this year as a US-UK Fulbright scholar. In a statement, she described the book as an “intricately crafted story of hope, forgiveness, power and resilience … Not in a million years did I think anything like this would ever happen to me … I am massively lucky. More lucky and humbled and grateful than I can express.” The drama is being directed by Shawn Levy, whose previous productions include Stranger Things and the Night at the Museum franchise. Of Loberti’s casting, he said: “We searched the world and reviewed thousands of auditions. We never thought our path would lead to someone who has not only never acted professionally, but never auditioned before. “It was a jaw-drop moment when we first saw Aria Mia Loberti, who is both a natural performer and an advocate for disability … I can’t wait to tell this beautiful story with her at the centre.”",Arts/Film,Untrained blind student lands starring role in Netflix second world war epic,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/26/untrained-blind-student-lands-starring-role-in-netflix-second-world-war-epic
12/26/2021,"We live in capitalist economies that deliver great wealth, innovation and dynamism but lurch from systemic crisis to crisis, throw up gigantic inequalities and are careless about nature and the societies of which they are part. It’s obvious that we want more of the former and less of the latter – but how? Never easy, this question is now so bitterly dividing western politics that in the US there is even talk of a second civil war. Post-Brexit Britain is only fractionally less toxic. There are two increasingly hostile camps living in their intellectual and political silos. On the one hand, there are the “me firsts”, the apostles of salvation through individualism. Capitalism propelled by individuals aggressively pursuing their own self-interest will deliver the goods. It is essentially self-organising, self-propelling and self-dynamic. Don’t worry about booms, busts, monopoly and disastrous social side-effects; we have to put up with them as we do with the weather. They will sort themselves out in time. Any public intervention will bring errors and costs that outweigh the benefits. Allow the tall poppies to grow even taller and wealth will ultimately trickle down; inequality is the price paid for capitalist effectiveness. Capitalism harnesses the base metals of human greed and self-interest to deliver the alchemy of economic dynamism.  On the other hand, are the “we firsts”. They are equally passionate in their insistence that salvation lies in the group and society and convinced, whether on the climate emergency, hi-tech monopolies, crippling uncertainties about living standards or just the evident truth that we humans are altruists as much as individualists, that to follow the “me firsts” is the road to perdition. What is crucial to us as social beings is the group, society, the commonweal and belonging as equals. After all, it was associating in groups that was fundamental to our evolutionary capacity to hunt and to see off predators. That primeval urge to associate in the group is what underpins happiness and wellbeing. What people want is less the exercise of choice in markets, more to control their lives in the service of what they value – and that is best done collectively and, as far as possible, equitably. And so the “I’s” and “we’s” confront each other in intense enmity, crystallised in the debates about the proper reaction to the virus. The “I’s” inhabit a world in which we must make our own choices, even over vaccination, and the state must be minimalist. The “we’s” urge mandatory vaccination, early lockdowns and Covid passports. Yet the sustainable policy is to blend the two: to find ways of persuading individuals, by choice and shaming, to get vaccinated and to ensure that Covid passports are employed, but only when it is clear that public health demands it – for NHS and care workers and for any large events. Too much “we” zeal and there is insupportable state intrusion into our lives; too much “I” libertarianism and you are free to infect and maybe kill me. Yes, we need the pluralism of different options and individual agency; equally, we need an agile public realm and collective action to serve the group. The good society (and successful public policy) is one that cleverly uses its institutions to reconcile the “we” with the “I”. It is great institutions, in the private and public sectors, which bind society and mitigate the worst excesses of both group force and individual licence. The problem is that we have too few of them and those we do have are being undermined by the dominance of the “me firsts” who insist anything to do with the “we” is coercive and undermines liberty. Thus, despite the “me firsts”, we witness the success of the NHS through this pandemic, plainly dedicated to serve the “we” but never in such a way as to be oppressive. Thus, too, the amazing vaccines incubated in Oxford’s Jenner Institute, the university itself an example of combining the “we” of a shared academic vocation but with 37 individual, competing colleges. These were then rolled out with the impetus of the Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult, an institution part tax-funded and part funded from its own commercial activities but one consecrated to promoting the public interest of a strong cell and gene ecology. And all further enabled by an enlightened capitalist enterprise, AstraZeneca, which institutionally recognised its social purpose of promoting health by selling a billion doses at cost. Another institution that has proved its worth in the pandemic is the BBC, particularly its political and health teams. Laura Kuenssberg and Ros Atkins, for example, have shown the power of impartiality, while Fergus Walsh and Hugh Pym have been models of rock-solid, informed reporting. It has had a cascade effect on much of the media. In a deadly pandemic, beyond some on the Conservative backbenches and rightwing columnists, there can be no luxuriating in ideology. Everyone wants to get to the other side in the best and safest way they can. Our democratic institutions have been less secure. The checks and balances vital to political integrity have been found wanting. It should never have been possible for the prime minister to use executive discretion, backed by a parliamentary majority, retrospectively to change the terms of the committee on standards in public life; it should be understood that these institutions, including the Electoral Commission, can be reformed only deliberatively and with cross-party support. They represent the “we”. Public procurement, too, has proved spectacularlyopen to abuse. Meanwhile, the Tory party has demonstrated its institutional weakness, becoming hostage to its ultra-libertarian wing and arriving at public health policies erratically and often too late. The wider lesson is clear. If we want the best of capitalism and less of the worst, we need to build institutions across our economy, society and democracy that covenant through their constitutions, from a company to a university, that they will respect values we hold dear: equality, fairness, universality, transparency, societal obligation and sustainability. Indeed, in the face of 21st-century challenges – AI, the drive to net zero, levelling up – great institutions are more important than ever. They will not emerge spontaneously from markets and the operation of capitalism. They have to be created and sustained, the progressive project of the decades ahead.
