5/21/2022,"As is often the case with sisters, one of Russian President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs alleged daughters is publicly defying him while the other is defending her daddy dearest. His supposed youngest daughter, Katerina Tikhonova‚Äîa dancer‚Äîhas flown to Munich, Germany, more than 50 times in recent years, according to a report by Russian media outlet iStores and Germany‚Äôs Der Spiegel, which surely places her near the top of his list of ‚Äúpro-West Russians‚Äù who he has dissed, saying ‚Äútheir mentality is there, not here, with our people.‚Äù Another allegation in the report: The Russian president has also had to stomach‚Äîif true‚Äîthat his youngest daughter‚Äôs child with a ballet dancer shares a last name with Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky. The dancer/baby daddy Igor Zelensky is not related to Putin‚Äôs archenemy, according to the joint report, which was based on a dossier of leaked documents including flight records showing the Putin kid‚Äôs apparent love of European travel to where Zelensky was based during the time they are thought to have conceived their now 2-year-old daughter. Meanwhile, Putin‚Äôs eldest daughter Maria Vorontsova‚Äîa pediatric endocrinologist‚Äîhas been outed as the pro-Putin ‚ÄúMaria V.‚Äù Russian independent media outlet Republic editor Dmitry Kolezev published screenshots of her rants on Telegram where she attacked critics and left comments on a Moscow State University alumni website quoting her father on topics like Ukraine, the West, George Soros, and gay rights, according to the Times of London. One of the comments criticizes the use of the word ‚Äúannexation‚Äù and in another she says the West has ‚Äúalways done everything possible to ensure that Russia failed as a state.‚Äù She wrote, ‚ÄúIf suddenly, like almost happened in the 90s, Russia becomes a full-fledged raw-material appendage of the United States and EU, I‚Äôll be interested to see whom you blame for the fact that we‚Äôre not living in a prosperous economy.‚Äù Both daughters have been placed on sanctions lists by the U.S., but so far have avoided the same in Europe.

5/21/2022,"Getty Images Few people could make aerial yoga look easy, but Kate Upton has done just that. The 29-year-old actress and model ‚Äî¬†who regularly posts her workouts on social media¬†‚Äî¬†recently shared a photo on Instagram of herself hanging upside down in a precarious aerial yoga pose. (Related: These Videos of Ashley Graham Doing Aerial Yoga Prove the Workout Is No Joke) In the photo, Upton is suspended by a sling-like hammock in an inverted dancer pose, wearing a matching purple sports bra and leggings. The hammock is tucked under her lower back, providing all the support necessary to keep her above the ground. Upton is holding onto her right ankle with both hands behind her back, keeping her arms straight and gazing straight ahead. Although her head is mere inches away from the ground, Upton seems at ease in the pose, as she hangs above a teal yoga mat surrounded by wilderness. ""I'm really getting the hang of this üôÉ,"" she wrote in her caption. Not only does aerial yoga offer a prime photo opp for the 'gram, but it's also a serious workout with loads of benefits. A single 50-minute aerial yoga session provides cardiovascular effects on par with low- to moderate-intensity exercise, according to a 2016 study commissioned by the American Council on Exercise. The study also found that participants increased muscle mass and decreased fat mass over a six-week period of doing aerial yoga regularly. Plus, it's a serious core workout. ""A benefit of taking your routine off the ground is that you lose your point of stability,"" Lindsey Duggan, the owner of AIR Aerial Fitness in Los Angeles previously told Shape. ""You'll start to engage your core immediately without even realizing it."" Aerial yoga may also help you get better at traditional yoga poses that are challenging on the mat, such as headstands and forearm stands. ""The silk wraps around your body and supports you in certain difficult poses like inversions, giving you the experience of how a pose should feel,"" said Duggan. Not to mention the fact that it's a zero-impact workout, which makes it easier on the joints that many other forms of exercise.

5/21/2022,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany will deliver the first 15 Gepard tanks to Ukraine in July, a defence ministry spokesperson in Berlin said on Friday, confirming a media report. German Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht had agreed this in a conversation with her Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov, via video link, he added. At the end of April, Germany announced that it would for the first time supply Kyiv with heavy weapons, namely Gepard air-defence tanks, after critics accused Berlin of dragging its heels on heavy weapons deliveries to Kyiv. Since then, Germany also pledged seven self-propelled howitzers to Kyiv and has started training Ukrainian troops on these guns. According to a government source, the Gepard tanks will be supplied with ""sufficient"" ammunition. The source said there were enough rounds for almost 100 combat loadings, with one loading good to fight 25 targets. Ukraine's pleas for heavy weapons have intensified since Moscow has turned its fiercest firepower on the country's east and south, after failing to take the capital, Kyiv.
