5/9/2022,"In a quiet corner of Scotland’s east coast, a modern football fairytale is being written. Arbroath FC, the Scottish Championship’s only part-time club, are in the promotion play-offs after finishing as runners-up in the second tier. “We’re so close to immortality,” their manager, Dick Campbell, tells me. “Nobody else will ever do this.” Campbell is a hardened veteran of Scotland’s lower leagues, having coached more than 1,000 games across three decades. Now, just four matches stand between his side and the Premiership, starting with the first leg of their semi-final at Inverness Caledonian Thistle on Tuesday night. Win that tie, and the 11th-placed side in the top flight – probably St Johnstone – await in the two-legged final. The colourful 68-year-old manager, an excitable whirlwind of one-liners, has become the face of Arbroath’s extraordinary rise – but if he is feeling any pressure on his shoulders, he doesn’t show it. “I couldn’t give a monkey’s hoot if we go up or not – I honestly couldn’t,” Campbell insists. “But now we’re in this position … you have to have a go, don’t you?” When Campbell arrived at Arbroath six years ago, the picture could scarcely have been more different. The Red Lichties – named after the town’s harbour lights that guide boats back to shore – were labouring in the fourth tier, playing to meagre crowds of fewer than 500 people at Gayfield Park. The club’s home ground backs directly on to the North Sea, its open terraces exposed to fog, freezing winds and even the occasional rogue wave. Campbell had been keen to get back into management after being dismissed by another Angus side, Forfar Athletic. “The guy who sacked me has apologised since, and said he was an idiot,” he chuckles. Campbell kept Arbroath afloat, but there was little sense of what was to come. “My first game was down at Berwick, we got beat 4-1,” he recalls. “I thought to myself: ‘What the fuck have I done?’” From the edge of oblivion, Arbroath have scaled the lower leagues in just six years. Campbell has led promotion charges before, notably with Brechin City – but where other part-time clubs have faltered at this level, Arbroath have thrived. “We’ve been in the top three since September,” Campbell points out. “We’ve only lost five games all season. The statistics show we deserve to be where we are.” Arbroath have already come agonisingly close to winning the division outright. In their crunch game at promotion rivals Kilmarnock, they were 12 minutes from a win that would have put the title’s destiny in their own hands on the final day. Instead, Killie found two late goals, and went up as champions. Campbell and the 2,300 maroon-clad away fans could only watch on as the celebrations began. “That was a heartbreaker,” Campbell admits. “I made a balls of that … I should have gone five at the back.” It was then that an old friend got in touch with some advice. “Alex Ferguson called. He told me: ‘Don’t let one game muck your season up’. Alex still talks to a lot of managers, and it’s always nice to get a phone call from him – particularly a complimentary one!” Campbell has devoted his career to playing and coaching in Scotland’s lower leagues, but even he is not a full-time employee at Arbroath – and has no intention of becoming one, even if they gatecrash the Premiership. “I’m not dependent on football,” says Campbell, who works with his twin brother, Ian, in both spheres of his professional life. Away from football, the pair run a successful recruitment business. “I work for my brother during the day, and he works for me at night,” Campbell explains. Ian, nicknamed “Pink”, is the club’s assistant manager, and the pair make for an engaging double act. “I’ve never been in a changing room when I’m laughing before the game,” the on-loan forward Joel Nouble told local paper The Courier in November. “The relationship they have is crazy. Their team talks are unbelievable.” Michael McKenna, the Championship player of the year and Arbroath’s creative spark, is an electrician off the pitch. He believes the sense of camaraderie is key. “We’re all working class and help each other out,” the midfielder has said. “We are all in it together.” As for Campbell, he is clearly proud and protective of his players, many of whom work on match days and travel an hour to Perth for training. “We keep progressing every year because every player I sign is better than what I’ve got,” Campbell tells me. “That’s my philosophy – I’m not a rocket scientist.” Recruitment has played a key part in reaching a collective goal to be “the best part-time team in Scotland,” building on a core group of players who Campbell inherited, that he feels were unfairly written off. Before 2016, Arbroath’s main claim to fame was a scoreline: 36-0, an 1885 Scottish Cup win over Bon Accord that still graces the record books. Fans huddled behind the goals at Gayfield could be forgiven for thinking that was as good as it would ever get. But their team won the League 2 title in Campbell’s first full season in charge, adding the League 1 crown in 2018-19 – and now, another promotion beckons. “Arbroath have been good to me,” says Campbell. “It’s a classy place, they’re very nice people. Every single director has a job to do – they don’t stand around drinking gin and tonics.” Crowds of more than 3,000 regularly watch the team these days, with new hospitality suites sold out for the whole season – perhaps because their much-loved manager regularly shows up for a pre-game chat with guests. “It is absolutely incredible how the club’s fortunes have changed,” Campbell says. “There are very few buses going to Celtic and Rangers games from Arbroath now. They’re all coming to watch us.” I remind him that Scotland’s big two could visit the Angus coast for league games next season, and he briefly allows himself to dream. “The whole nation is behind us,” he says with a smile. “If we do go up, it’ll be historic, immortal, all of that. And we’ll have a go! We’ll probably get beat every single week. But then again, they said that when we came into this league.” The story of Arbroath’s remarkable rise from obscurity may have a few more chapters to come.",Sport/Football,‘Close to immortality’: Arbroath’s part-timers chase Premiership dream,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/09/arbroath-scottish-premiership-play-offs-dick-campbell
5/9/2022,"Conservative groups perpetuating Donald Trump’s false charges that the 2020 election was rigged have sparked a lawsuit against one in Colorado, and a congressional panel investigation of another in New Mexico, over aggressive tactics allegedly used to seek out possible voter fraud. The scrutiny and criticism facing these conservative groups underscore how Trump loyalists in several US states are working to sustain falsehoods about Trump’s loss, while launching new drives that voting rights advocates say smack of voter intimidation, often targeting communities of color. A lawsuit was filed by the NAACP and two other groups in March charging that Colorado-based US Election Integrity Plan (USEIP), which has echoed Trump’s baseless claims about 2020 election fraud, has gone door to door in some counties aggressively questioning residents about their voting status and sometimes bearing arms. Moreover, the House Committee on Oversight and Reform has been investigating EchoMail, a firm that helped push false claims of election fraud in Arizona and has reportedly been paid $50,000 by a New Mexico county to oversee a local “audit force” doing intrusive door-to-door voter canvassing. Other states including Michigan and Utah boast conservative groups that, under the guise of protecting voting integrity by ferreting out fraud, have been criticized for the methods they employed in seeking out potential voter fraud. “As Americans, we expect and demand an open and participatory democracy that welcomes all voters equally,” said Danielle Lang, senior director of voting rights at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. “Those engaging in these pressure tactics should know that voter intimidation is a crime with serious consequences.” The lawsuit against USEIP filed by the NAACP in Colorado, the League of Women Voters in Colorado and Mi Familia Vota charges that USEIP has engaged in “door-to-door voter intimidation”, including taking pictures of some houses, in neighborhoods with a large number of minority residents. The lawsuit alleges, without providing specific cases, that USEIP representatives have at times worn badges or carried firearms when visiting voters’ residences, although they are not government officials. “We’re very concerned about reports that Colorado voters have received visits at their homes from people, sometimes openly armed, posing as government officials who imply, without evidence, that fraudulent voting activity occurred at their address,” Beth Hendrix, the League of Women voters executive director in Colorado told the Guardian. A Colorado judge last week rejected a motion by USEIP to dismiss the lawsuit. A separate motion by the plaintiffs’ two counsels, the nonprofit legal group Free Speech for People and the law firm Lathrop GPM, to obtain a preliminary injunction to halt USEIP’s efforts is pending. The lawsuit partly rests on a measure that passed after the Civil War, called the KKK Act, aimed at stopping white terrorists from using violence to interfere with Black voters. USEIP, which started after Joe Biden defeated Trump, is run by Shawn Smith, a retired air force colonel who also leads Cause of America, a nationwide group that boasts that its role is to “enable, facilitate and support citizen grassroots action to restore trust in local elections”. Mike Lindell, the multimillionaire Trump loyalist who is CEO of MyPillow and has been the chief financier of Cause of America, told the Guardian that the group serves as an “information hub” with a presence in all 50 states and on his website FrankSpeech.com. Lindell estimated he has spent between $100,000 and $200,000 monthly for salaries for the group’s employees – except for Smith, who is unpaid – and other expenses. Smith was reportedly tapped by Lindell to run Cause of America last fall, after Smith attended a Lindell-organized “cyber symposium” last summer in South Dakota which promoted conspiratorial and baseless claims of voting fraud in 2020. An organizing manual for USEIP thanks Lindell, but he told the Guardian that he had no ties with it. Smith can be seen in a 39-second video clip in a large crowd of Trump loyalists who were at the Capitol during the 6 January assault and another photo that was released by Colorado Newsline and relied on ProPublica research. Smith did not reply to emails sent to Cause of America seeking comment. Other outfits with track records for claiming the 2020 election was rigged have popped up in New Mexico, where ostensibly in the name of ferreting out voting fraud, they have sparked concerns about intimidating voters in areas with large minority populations. Top Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform in March announced an investigation into allegations from state officials that EchoMail was retained by tiny Otero county to examine potential voting fraud in part by overseeing a door-to-door voter canvass. The founder of EchoMail, VA Shiva Ayyadurai, has been a frequent promoter of unfounded conspiracies about the 2020 election results as well as a Senate primary in Massachusetts that he lost, and the firm was also a subcontractor for a widely debunked Arizona audit of its largest county. EchoMail’s contract, according to records obtained and published by the watchdog group American Oversight and first reported by NBC News, called for it to supervise a door-to-door voter canvass by a groupcalled the New Mexico Audit Force, to check the accuracy of voter rolls. The company’s contract also said it would inspect ballot images in the county, and assess voter signatures for accuracy. The House Oversight Committee chair, Carolyn Maloney, and the chair of its subcommittee on civil rights and civil liberties, Jamie Raskin, wrote Ayyadurai in March that it is “investigating whether your company’s audit and canvass in New Mexico interferes with Americans’ right to vote by spreading disinformation about elections and intimidating voters”. The House letter pointed out that 40% of the county’s residents are non-white Hispanic, and raised the concern that the company’s canvas could “have a particular impact on minority communities in Otero county”. Otero county, which has a population of 67,000 people, was won by Trump by more than 25% of the vote in 2020. In response, Ayyadurai denied EchoMail was playing any such role in Otero county and did not provide requested documents, prompting another letter to Ayyadurai with evidence and statements from a New Mexico couple involved in the “audit force”. A committee spokesperson told the Guardian that “Dr Ayyadurai has denied EchoMail’s participation in the sham audit and canvass, directly contradicting statements made by leaders of the New Mexico Audit Force and raising serious doubts about his credibility”. The panel is now weighing its next moves “to get to the bottom of this so-called audit and prevent other attacks on our elections”, the spokesperson added. The oversight committee also wrote in March to justice department assistant attorney general Kristen Clarke of the civil rights division to share its concerns about possible negative impacts of EchoMail’s Otero county efforts. On a related voting front, congresswoman Maloney told the Guardian in a statement that another investigation she launched last month with congresswoman Zoe Lofren, the chair of the House administration committee, is looking into “election disinformation in Arizona, Florida, Ohio and Texas. This is a fight for our democracy, and I am committed to finding solutions.” Lang of the Campaign Legal Center stressed that groups trying to find fraud while harassing voters or spreading disinformation won’t succeed and will be challenged. “The right to vote is the bedrock of our society and voters won’t be bullied out of exercising their rights,” Lang said.",News/US news,Groups perpetuating Trump’s 2020 election lie face scrutiny and lawsuits,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/09/conservative-groups-trump-election-lie-lawsuits-scrutiny
5/9/2022,"Born in Glasgow, Lorraine Kelly has worked in journalism since she turned down a university place to join the East Kilbride News at the age of 17. The 62-year-old became Scotland correspondent for TV-am in 1984, and joined GMTV when it launched in 1993. Since 2010, she has presented Lorraine on ITV. What was the best thing you did on screen last year?To be honest, just keeping going and still being able to do my job through the pandemic. Covid got very close to us with what happened with Kate [Garraway and her husband, Derek Draper, who was hospitalised for more than a year], and a lot of our crew have been affected in some way, so we had to be very careful. Video calls have definitely made interviewees more accessible, though – I did lots of big, big stars on Zoom from their houses. I’d be in my house in my slippers, and there’s George Clooney, or Pierce Brosnan in his house in Hawaii. It made it feel more human – you could be like: “Oh, I have that book too!” I also made a documentary, Return to Dunblane, which was something I really wanted to do. What the families did there to change the law was a remarkable achievement – they made something positive out of something unimaginably horrific. I think the fact that I did hard news for years and I was a correspondent was the best training. If you can report on something like Dunblane or Lockerbie, you can do anything. Who would play you in the TV show of your life?The drag queen Lawrence Chaney. Have you ever been mistaken for anybody else?No, but I will be toddling around with my husband in the supermarket, and people will come up and start chatting to us. He’ll just stand here, and then they’ll go, and he’ll say: “How do we know them?” And I’m like: “We don’t!” What show had you gripped during the last year?It’s a Sin. That was my life, except we were in Glasgow not London, and my best friend, Joyce, was like the wee lassie Jill. That drama did such a lot of good – it really made people think. I think what trans people are going through now is like what gay people were going through when I was growing up. Your TV guilty pleasureBelow Deck. My daughter introduced me to it – it’s utterly vacuous and completely wonderful. What makes you reach for the remote (to turn the TV off)?Naked Attraction. I don’t understand that at all. The only time I saw it was when I did Celebrity Gogglebox and they showed a clip – I couldn’t believe my eyes. What made me laugh was that at the end they had a credit for the wardrobe lady!  Lorraine airs weekdays at 9am on ITV.

5/9/2022,"In this Zoom call, four men are looking at a list of family duties and marking which they do themselves and which they have been leaving to their partners. Earning money. School run. Laundry. Ironing. Cooking. Cleaning the bathroom. Buying school uniform. Putting children to bed … Next, they discuss why that may be. “It’s just how we operate,” says one, a man who is no longer living with his partner, but spending a lot of time with her and their new baby. “She loves cooking. I don’t iron. She does iron …” He runs out of steam. “The way I look at it, I’ve been married 20 years and you evolve into what you do,” says another. “That’s how you decide what your jobs are. I do cook a meal occasionally but 95% of the time, she does the cooking and plans the shopping because she knows what she needs to feed the family. I earn the money to pay for it.” The third man is currently single. “I used to take things for granted when I was in a relationship,” he says. “Dinner being on the table, having clean clothes, having ironed clothes. I never really thought about it when I came in the door. I’m not sure that was being abusive; it’s just the way things worked. Well … until we split up. Maybe that’s why.” This quiet contemplation of the domestic workload shows how far these men have come. This is the 12th module of the Lifeline behaviour-change course run by My CWA, a Cheshire-based charity that supports families affected by domestic abuse. All four of these men have been abusive to partners. Their attendance here is voluntary; two were referred by social workers, the other two referred themselves. One even moved to the area, living with his brother, just to qualify for the support (before the pandemic it was face-to-face group meetings; now it is delivered through Zoom). Only about half the men who start Lifeline stick with it to the end. There is no compulsion, it’s a long and demanding course, and it requires perpetrators to take full responsibility for their actions with all the emotional consequences this may bring. These four, however, have already come a long way. They have completed level 1, which takes about 10 weeks. They discussed what brought each of them there and unpacked the worst incidents of abuse, along with their feelings and thoughts at the time. It taught them some safety strategies and emergency techniques to help them de-escalate and step back when tensions rise. Now they are more than halfway through level 2, which takes 22 to 24 weeks. Today they are covering the role of gender in abusive relationships. Next week, it’s “healthy sexual relationships”. Many of them found last week’s session particularly tough. It was on the impact on children, and began with the men listening to a recording of a terrified child calling 999 as her mum is being beaten up at home. Then Colette Foster, the course leader, laid out the effects for children of witnessing domestic abuse – the impact on their educational attainment and life chances, and their increased risk of suicide, cancer, heart disease and substance abuse. She set out how it affects offspring of all ages, from babies to adults. She told the men what signs to look for and the men discussed their own children – and their own childhoods. Unsurprisingly, it became emotional: one man became so upset that Foster checked in with him the next day to ensure he was OK and would be coming back. Yet today he is here discussing housework, and how to show appreciation to a partner. (“This session hasn’t been as head-doing as some of the others,” he is relieved to say at the end.) For decades, perpetrator programmes like this have been low profile and low priority. Spending scarce resources on abusers has been viewed with deep suspicion across much of the women’s sector, where the focus and the funding have, unsurprisingly, been on the survivors. In 2019/20, 64% of refuge referrals were turned away and the number of refuge bed spaces in England was 30% below the level recommended by the Council of Europe. Only just over a third of services were able to provide formal counselling to women in their refuges. Just over a quarter were running without a dedicated resettlement service. “Finding a refuge space is like finding gold dust,” is how Sandra Horley, former CEO of Refuge, put it in 2016. “How can we justify spending money on therapy for perpetrators when terrified and brutalised women and children have nowhere to go?” Now, however, something is shifting. Respect, the UK’s lead organisation on perpetrator programmes, has firmly positioned itself as part of the movement tackling violence against women and girls. Some of its programmes are delivered in partnership with groups such as Women’s Aid, or the domestic violence charity SafeLives. And a six-year evaluation of 11 Respect-accredited UK perpetrator programmes by Durham and London Metropolitan universities found significant improvement over a range of behaviours. Interviewing partners, ex-partners, children and perpetrators, researchers found that reports of women being physically injured dropped from 61% before the programme to 2% afterwards. Cases of children seeing or hearing violence dropped from 80% to 8%. The results have been compelling enough for the Home Office to get behind them: in March, its Tackling Domestic Abuse Plan pledged £75m for perpetrator programmes – far more than it ever had before. Saskia Lightburn-Ritchie, the CEO of My CWA, understands why it has taken so long to get here. When she introduced Lifeline more than a decade ago, she wasn’t convinced it was the right way to spend resources. At the time, My CWA provided support, including refuges, to survivors of domestic abuse, but many survivors said that even when they had successfully separated from their abuser, the abuse continued, especially if co-parenting was involved. “They were saying that no one at all was talking to the men about their behaviour, and it might help if someone would,” says Lightburn-Ritchie. “It seemed a reasonable and sensible request – but it opened a can of worms.” When My CWA launched the Lifeline pilot, there was vehement opposition from the north-west women’s sector. Women’s Aid tried to cancel its membership. “On a personal level, I’d been a victim of domestic abuse myself. I’d lived in a refuge,” says Lightburn-Ritchie. “Then I’d spent 20 years working in women-only services. I wasn’t sure that I could treat the men on the programme with respect. I thought I’d struggle with my own feelings about what they’d done. And I wasn’t even confident that change was possible.” Yet she also believed it made sense to try. “We focus all our efforts on victims and children, which is right,” she says. “But, by not engaging with perpetrators and trying to hold them to account in a way that they can make a change, all we are doing is condemning any new person in a relationship with them to the same behaviours, the same abuse. It’s just recreated in another family. It’s like tackling a huge problem by only looking at symptoms not the cause, and it makes you tired. Well, it makes me tired. I want that cycle to break.” Lightburn-Ritchie has very clear memories of delivering the first programme. “I was very surprised at my own reaction,” she says. “I was able to see them as whole individuals whose behaviours were wrong but who had other positive features. There was one man who was really getting it, having lightbulb moments, so engaged. Then his child became very unwell, he wasn’t coping and he assaulted his partner. I was devastated. But, for the first time ever, he didn’t breach bail, he didn’t pressure her to withdraw the charges; he pleaded guilty straight away.” That was a breakthrough. Lifeline is accredited by Respect – and the accreditation system couldn’t be more critical. Respect was formed 21 years ago when a handful of perpetrator programmes joined together, partly to raise the profile of their work, but also to articulate good practice at a time when they worried about perpetrators setting up self-help groups, or short interventions such as weekend courses, and simplistic “anger management” programmes. (Most perpetrators are already “managing their anger” very precisely. They manage not to explode at their boss or the big man at the gym, but still terrorise and control their partners.) Ciara Bergman, Respect’s head of perpetrator services, cautions that programmes that don’t adhere to certain principles could make things worse. “When you’re delivering perpetrator work, the primary client is not the person in front of you,” she says. “It has to be focused on the adult and child survivors of that abuse. We don’t think any work should take place with perpetrators in the absence of parallel but separate support for survivors.” Because of this, a Respect-accredited programme will only take on a perpetrator if their partner (or ex-partner if there are children and contact) agrees to be involved. A separate “partner-support worker” will then keep them informed and supported throughout. “One of the most persuasive factors for a woman remaining with an abusive partner is the hope that they will get better,” says Bergman. “If a perpetrator says: ‘I’m going off on a programme to fix my behaviour’, she might choose to stay in a risky situation. Then if he stops attending, she might not know.” (On one Respect training session, I see a letter sent to a partner purporting to be from the programme facilitators, although it was actually written by the perpetrator himself: “We want to let you know that Mr X is fully engaged with the programme and has shown willingness and real commitment to making the necessary changes …”) “A lot of perpetrators are very manipulative,” says Bergman. “They may come home and say: ‘I’ve spoken to the facilitators, and they say it’s your fault. They say you need to do XYZ.’” The Lifeline course leaders are also trained to recognise deception or “disguise compliance”, where a perpetrator may say all the right things, but mean none of them. However, Lightburn-Ritchie is convinced the courses can have real impact. “There are a few key sessions that astound me every time they are delivered,” she says. “One is impact on children. Often the men have an innate belief that, although their behaviours are harmful, they are still ‘good dads’. They manage to live with that dichotomy. When they start listening and making a connection with what they’ve done and their own children’s experience, I’ve seen men who have served prison sentences break down and cry.” Another powerful session is around healthy sexual relationships. “I remember interviewing someone after he’d completed the course to see how he got on, four years later,” she says. “We’d never met before. He told me the hardest part had been to acknowledge that he’d sexually assaulted his wife – and that, actually, it was rape. Then he said he had to admit to himself that he’d always known, but just not listened to himself. It devastated him, but he said: ‘I had to be broken to be fixed.’ “He wrote his ex-wife a huge letter of apology, taking responsibility. She didn’t get in touch and he had accepted that he couldn’t make her and didn’t expect anything of her. He was in a new relationship that was running smoothly. There was a huge amount of growth. I was gobsmacked.” John, 28, has been through a Respect-accredited programme and agrees to speak to me. Although he is quiet and cautious, his words are compelling. He found the programme – Route2 in Middlesbrough – through an internet search and referred himself. It is one-on-one, with similar content to Lifeline. (He had previously attended a group programme but walked out. “I just got sick of listening to people beating about the bush, saying it was their partner’s fault,” he says.) He says he has only had one serious relationship in his life, which lasted two years. “It was abusive for a while,” he says. “It ended badly in 2019. It got to the point where I was arrested. I don’t want to tell you what I did. I’m not over it. I’m still learning from it.” He began Route2 in early 2020, initially on Zoom, then in person when lockdown eased. “What helped most was going deep into why my behaviour was the way it was,” he says. “For me, I always thought that I was a bad person. Nina, my case manager, helped me think about my own family, the way I grew up and the part all that played. I’m not using my childhood as an excuse, but it helped me understand. Nina was more on the side of what I need to change, instead of judging me. She put different thoughts in my head.” Almost two years on, he still calls Nina every week, just to check in, and he is still single. “I’m not ready for any relationship; I’m focused on being better myself,” he says. For John, the programme feels worthwhile. “I’ll be brutally honest. You can’t help someone who doesn’t think they’re in the wrong. If you accept what you’ve done, if you really want help and you’ve stopped blaming everyone else, then anyone can change.” In the UK, to talk to someone about your violence and domestic abuse, call the Respect helpline on 0808 802 4040, Monday to Thursday 10am-8pm, Friday 10am-5pm.

5/9/2022,"Inever thought breastfeeding would be hard. When I thought about it at all, my mind conjured beatific scenes suffused with a sort of religious glow. There I was, genteelly offering the child a nipple in the manner of a renaissance Madonna, which the child accepted politely and cherubically. What a pretty picture we made. Well, those preconceptions were – excuse my language – complete horseshit. These days I envisage more of a triptych: the infant Jesus spluttering at the breast, face purple with hangry fury; the infant Jesus possetting milk down Mary’s front; the infant Jesus and the nappy explosion. A few weeks ago, I wrote about the negativity surrounding parenthood, and how people love to bombard pregnant women with it. The only exception I’d make to this is breastfeeding. Breastfeeding has incredible PR. You’re told constantly how amazing it is for you and the baby. It’s the best way to nourish and bond with your child, who will become a genius as a result! It’s so convenient! You’ll lose so much weight! Most importantly, it’s hugely beneficial to the baby’s health! No one says: it hurts. At least not beforehand. Once you tell other mothers it hurts they say, grimly, “yep”. It makes sense that it would hurt, because having a small creature attacking your nipples every 40 minutes would hurt, wouldn’t it? It’s OK though, because, you’re told, they’ll “toughen up”. Tough nipples: just what I always wanted. Meanwhile, if you tell professionals that it hurts they will tell you that you’re doing it wrong, which makes it feel worse. (Maybe you are doing it wrong – historically, you’d be surrounded by experienced female relatives who would help position you and the baby correctly.) Perhaps you already feel like enough of a failure, because desperately wanting to feed your child with your body and not being able to taps into something quite fundamental, really. Something that may have the potential to make you depressed. The UK has one of the lowest breastfeeding rates in the world, with just 24% of women exclusively breastfeeding at six weeks in England and 1% at six months, which is recommended by the WHO. Eight out of ten women stopped before they wanted to. Furthermore, while breastfeeding is linked to lower rates of postnatal depression, a large-scale survey also found that women who wanted to breastfeed but did not (or could not) were over twice as likely to become depressed as mothers who had not planned to, and who did not, breastfeed. I’m not surprised. The culture of guilt – much of which manifests in subtle, almost diffuse atmospheric pressure, though social media obnoxiousness also plays a role – makes me want to smash things, but I’m too tired. Breastfeeding, I read, is the equivalent of walking seven miles a day. Another thing they don’t tell you is that you might not ever get more than three hours’ sleep, none of it deep. And you’ll realise how profoundly uncomfortable your sofa is. I can see why they don’t want to put women off, what with the enormous public health benefits of breastfeeding, for babies especially. Besides, many women have a fine old time of it. They are “EBF” – exclusively breastfeeding – a phrase I’ve started to imagine accompanied by jazz hands. Some post photographs of all the milk they are expressing and freezing – look! So much milk! Their proud tallies: 14 months! 18 months! 36 months! And they should be proud. It’s work. I find myself thinking about the wet nurses throughout history who would take in extra infants to feed as well as their own. The labour involved would have been intensely physically and emotionally draining. I also sympathise a bit more with the women who chose to outsource it than I perhaps once did. Saying all this, when it starts to go well, it’s lovely, and if your baby isn’t premature and doesn’t have to deal with tongue tie, undersupply, oversupply, mastitis or blocked ducts it might be a very simple, very peaceful, happy process. I’ve been mostly very lucky with the support I’ve received with the challenges of feeding a preterm baby, but others have not been so fortunate. There is something wrong with a culture wherein the mother’s sanity can be sidelined to the extent that – as one parent and psychologist described – the only professional who might tell a woman that it’s OK to give her baby formula is part of a perinatal mental health team. Promotion of breastfeeding, important though it is, should never come at the expense of a mother’s mental health. To quote one expert: “Breastmilk does not care for, nurture and bond with the baby. A mother does.” Meanwhile, my friend who has had a double mastectomy is irritated that there’s a law prohibiting the discounting of infant formula. She also, having observed the culture of guilt, says she feels glad the decision how to feed her baby was taken out of her hands. Think on that statement for a moment. As it is, my own “breastfeeding journey” (another phrase I hate) has involved a rail replacement bus. I’m grateful for the existence of formula for keeping my baby alive when I couldn’t, and for helping my baby grow to a healthy size while I established breastfeeding. I’m not about to become a shill for big formula, who have behaved despicably in all kinds of ways, but nor will I self-flagellate. Or I’ll try not to, at least not all the time. As for advice from all the self-appointed freelance paediatricians, I can do without it. A good lactation consultant, though, is worth her weight in gold. Turns out, with the right support, it can get better – as it has for us. It’s a shame that so many British women lack that support after years of government cuts. There are a multitude of reasons why a woman might stop breastfeeding, including a lack of support, needing to work, pathetic paternity leave provision (having a partner who can feed the mother while she feeds the baby is a luxury few have), the stigmatising of public feeding, or mental health concerns. Guilt-tripping parents who are struggling or hiding the challenges of breastfeeding from them will not solve, and may even worsen, the problem. What’s working: I’m not sure the artist Keith Haring ever envisaged his work becoming part of a baby range, but Etta Loves have reproduced it on sensory strips and my baby, who can currently only see in monochrome, is fascinated and mesmerised by them. It’s his first experience of art and has made me tempted to go on a tour of all the black and white works that can be found in galleries – Brigitte Riley, Malevich, etc. Though I’d have to hold him very close to the canvases. What isn’t: A TikTok video of a baby being swaddled, its cries immediately silenced, went viral this week. Sadly, it hasn’t worked for us, only serving to enrage the child further.

5/9/2022,"Christine Teague works to find clients “under the bridge and by the dumpster”. Typically, they are people who inject drugs. Often, they are unhoused. All have HIV. Once she finds them, Teague, who is the director of the Ryan White HIV program in Charleston, the state capital of West Virginia, might deliver the results of an HIV test, or the medication to reduce a patient’s viral load. What she cannot provide them with, however, is a powerful tool to prevent the spread of HIV: sterile syringes. “I was really trying to be proactive in getting out into the community, and [to] educate people about the importance of using clean syringes,” said Teague, who along with local public health authorities was able to keep HIV numbers lower by distributing clean needles. “Hundreds” of people showed up for sterile syringes each week. But in 2018, the city imposed severe restrictions on syringe service programs. Soon, cases were rising. Now, amid an HIV outbreak in her city, Teague says her program can only work “with our hands tied behind our back”. The outbreak has been severe. Kanawha county, where Charleston is the seat, diagnosed 40 people who inject drugs with HIV in 2020, about as many as New York City, a place 47 times more populous than the rural county of 178,000. Last year, the head of HIV prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned Kanawha had the nation’s “most concerning” outbreak of HIV among injection drug users. Last month, the Biden administration pushed to expand access to clean needles for people who inject drugs. Its National Drug Control Strategy outlined a plan to expand syringe service programs by 85% in high-overdose counties. But there is little chance of that happening here, where the same syringe restrictions pioneered in Charleston and the nearby city of Huntington were later adopted statewide by West Virginia lawmakers. A Guardian analysis has found that between 2018 and early 2022, nearly half of all syringe service programs registered with health authorities in West Virginia shuttered – and the local fight against clean needles even drew in the Democratic US senator Joe Manchin. In an investigation, the CDC pinpointed the moment the outbreak picked up steam. After the restrictions on syringes, a county-run program that once served “hundreds” of people was forced to shut down, and access to clean syringes was decimated. Teague was suddenly left to search for those at high risk for HIV, rather than proactively test people who showed up. The outbreak began by December 2018. Lack of clean syringes “directly led to the HIV outbreak going on”, said Robin Pollini, an infectious disease epidemiologist and expert in a substance use at West Virginia University. “We have people getting completely preventable infectious diseases. We have people dying of completely preventable overdoses. The suffering is almost immeasurable.” There is ample data that clean syringes prevent transmission of blood-borne diseases. What’s more, they can also provide a venue to teach people who inject drugs how to use naloxone, an antidote to opioid overdoses. “We have reams upon reams of studies showing the efficacy of preventing HIV, preventing overdose deaths” by distributing clean syringes, said Drew Gibson, the director of advocacy for Aids United. “They are amazing interventions,” he said of the syringes. “And if they were about anything but people using drugs, they would be all over the place.” The restrictions mean that almost 1 million people in West Virginia, the state with the highest drug overdose rate in the US for nine years running, now live between 20 and 75 miles of the nearest needle exchange. Meanwhile, experts worry HIV is spreading undetected in rural West Virginia, where testing and treatment is limited. “The situation in West Virginia is particularly dire” because of the state law, said Pollini. “The way to prevent HIV in this population is to expand access to sterile syringes, and we do not have the ability to do that here.” Syringe service programs first came under attack in Charleston during a mayoral race. In 2018, Charleston’s mayor and police chief imposed severe restrictions on needle exchanges, in the name of a crackdown on crime and syringe litter. He required clients to show government-issued photo identification and proof of residency, and to return a syringe for every one they collected. For many people deep in the throes of addiction, these were impossible barriers. Already, the county had seen years of “rises in hepatitis B infection”, said Teague. “We were just kind of waiting for issues with HIV to emerge”. By 2021, less than two months after the CDC’s warning that Kanawha’s outbreak was among the nation’s worst, and fully aware of the situation, West Virginia lawmakers passed the most restrictive syringe program requirements in the nation. It happened amid an acceleration of the American drug overdose epidemic. More than 100,000 people in the US died of drug overdoses in 2021, worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic. The disaster is now, in 2022, driving the most interest in syringe service programs and other harm reduction policies in “recent memory”, according Gibson. For the first time in decades, a $30m fund in the Covid-19 stimulus bill allowed for government purchase of sterile syringes. But it also stoked conservative outrage, sucking in lawmakers including Manchin. When the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) issued a grant for organizations to buy and distribute clean syringes in February, the Biden administration was pilloried. A conservative news outlet described it as “distribution of crack pipes to drug addicts”; the Republican senator Ted Cruz tweeted the Biden administration’s “crime policy” was “crack pipes for all”. In response, Manchin joined two Republican colleagues to express concern about the plan. The following day, he introduced a bill to expand a decades-old, government-wide ban on the purchase of sterile syringes for drug use. He co-sponsored the bill with the Republican Florida senator Marco Rubio, whose home state has the second worst rate of new HIV diagnoses in the country. Although Manchin’s bill did not pass, it showed the political perils of trying to help people who inject drugs, even as the horror of death and disease ravage communities. Even the $30m in stimulus funding provides nowhere near the support needed, said Pollini, who described it as “searching under the couch cushions and looking for spare change”. “We need a massive, sustained infusion of funding for harm reduction,” she said. “Otherwise, we’re rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.”",News/US news,How restrictions on syringe programs led to a severe HIV outbreak in West Virginia,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/09/restrictions-syringe-programs-severe-hiv-outbreak-west-virginia
5/9/2022,"Today in Focus, the Guardian’s flagship daily news podcast, has launched a new four-part mini series covering the office of progressive Black district attorney Jason Williams on the heels of his election win in New Orleans in 2020. Recorded over a period of six months, the series follows the work of a new civil rights division in his office, tasked with re-examining past harms in the criminal legal system of America’s most incarcerated state. Launched on Friday 6 May and concluding today (Monday 9 May), The Division - New Orleans, is the latest offering from the Guardian’s award-winning Today in Focus podcast. The series follows several cases, including a previously unreported story of Kuantay Reeder who, for 28 years, has claimed he was wrongfully convicted of murder. The Division - New Orleans analyzes how the criminal justice system in New Orleans has, for centuries, disproportionately punished and condemned Black residents. The series also shows how a small team of prosecutors and investigators within the district attorney’s office have been attempting to reckon with the city’s past, and explores Williams’ election promises of greater fairness in the criminal legal system during an increase in violent crime. Presented by US southern bureau chief Oliver Laughland, and accompanied by two narrative longform pieces, the podcast series is the latest example of The Guardian’s continued investment in audio journalism and commitment to finding engaging ways to reach audiences with evolving formats, compelling narratives, and topical, in-depth investigations. Nicole Jackson, head of audio at the Guardian, said: “Podcasts are an important part of the Guardian’s strategy, allowing us to connect more closely with listeners, produce original impactful audio journalism and to tell stories in new and interesting ways. The Division, a new four-part investigative mini series for Today in Focus, is the perfect example of what our daily news podcast does best - working closely with the Guardian’s global newsroom to connect listeners with some of the best journalists in the world who have access to extraordinary stories. I’m excited to hear the response from listeners to The Division, especially as we look to do more original investigations and mini-series in Today in Focus over the coming year.” Oliver Laughland, Guardian US southern bureau chief and presenter of The Division - New Orleans, said: “Some investigations lend themselves more naturally to a long-form, immersive approach; it allows for greater context, placing listeners squarely in the story. I’m delighted to bring the investigation to life with The Guardian’s support and grateful to the civil rights division for allowing me to observe their work as well as the many people—both formerly incarcerated and victims of crime—who so generously shared their experiences with me.” The Guardian has been creating podcasts for over fifteen years, and the term podcast was first coined in the Guardian in 2004, by its columnist Ben Hammersley. The Guardian’s combined podcast network now enjoys millions of listens every month, with global monthly listens to Guardian podcasts having increased by over 60% since the start of the pandemic (Feb 2020-March 2022). The Division - New Orleans, a four-part mini series from Today in Focus, runs across four consecutive days, from Friday 6 May to Monday 9 May. For additional insights on the investigation, two accompanying long form pieces are available for reading: Inside the division: how a small team of US prosecutors fight decades of shocking injustice and Life in prison for stealing $20: how the Division is taking apart brutal criminal sentences. The series is presented by Oliver Laughland. The series executive producer is Nicole Jackson.

5/9/2022,"When Craig Eblett joined the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) from the private sector more than 20 years ago, he admits it was a bit of a shock. “I’d come from an organisation where we had our own engineers, our own IT department and we used to just get things done,” he says. “DWP was very different.” But Eblett, who is now director of digital delivery for shared platforms, says the transformation he’s seen over the past two decades has been remarkable. “We’ve been on a massive journey. We have around 4,000 people now [in DWP Digital], including highly skilled engineers, user researchers and agile delivery leads to make sure we have full control over delivering great digital products and services to the organisation and to the country.” That in-house expertise was vital when the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020. DWP Digital had to ensure that all DWP services remained secure and stable for its 20 million customers, even as those colleagues who could, moved to work from home. An estimated 10,000 rapid IT changes were rolled out, and the universal credit digital service was bolstered to deal with more than 10 times the usual number of claims. The experience marked a step change in a transformation journey that’s believed to be the biggest public sector digital programme of its type in Europe. There are five goals to DWP’s Digital Future strategy – delivering great services, building new user-centred solutions, using new technologies and data to innovate, adopting common approaches to technology components and building capacity and capability. “There’s sometimes a perception in government that everything takes years,” Eblett says. “Now we’ve proven to ourselves and others what DWP Digital can do.” Nearly 40 projects have been launched recently, one of which created a more convenient way for people to claim child maintenance payments. Instead of a 40-minute phone call with an agent, users can now access online applications 24/7, and spend an average of 18 minutes completing an application. Another service enabled customers to apply for pension credit online, with two thirds of new claims now being made in this way. Emma Stace leads a new benefits transformation programme. She recently joined DWP Digital, from the Department for Education (DfE), as the digital director for health and disability benefits supporting services. In line with the department’s broader digital mission, the project aims to make the service more streamlined, informed by data, and simple for users to navigate across the benefits that DWP administers, including the personal independence payment. “With the health assessment service, for example, at the moment users have several assessments related to different benefits. We’re trying to create an assessment that lots of benefits can pull from. It’s a really innovative part of our work,” says Stace. “We’re a large, long-established organisation and we have data across many, many systems. But we want to use data in the right way at the right time to make the best possible decisions, to improve the user experience, and to speed up the process.” Part of the challenge of realising the ambitions that the Digital Future agenda lays out is building capacity within the team. “We know we can deliver individual products and services in an agile way, but now we want to scale that to deliver much greater benefits faster, across many services,” says Eblett. The department plans to hire more than 1,000 digital specialists such as architects, developers, security experts and more, at its seven digital hub sites across the country (Newcastle, Manchester, Leeds, Blackpool, Birmingham, Sheffield and London). Hybrid working may be an option, with some employees working part of the week in their DWP office and part of the week from home. It’s a chance to work on some of the country’s biggest IT projects and make a tangible impact, says Eblett, and is “genuinely a nice place to come and use your expertise and develop further with fantastic training. And while there might still be a perception it’s a bit stodgy working in government, the truth is we’re at the cutting edge of some of the newest tools and we’re using them at a huge scale, adding real value.” There are opportunities to collaborate across departments, too. At DfE, Stace ran a cross-government network of chief digital innovation officers and says she is in regular contact with others to discuss challenges. One tangible example of that working was when HMRC helped DWP verify the identity of people remotely during lockdown, removing the need for face-to-face meetings. “We’re all learning from each other all the time,” says Stace. “It’s a very supportive and welcoming environment. You’re not in direct competition with each other in a way that I’ve experienced working in the private sector. People really help each other out. “I enjoy the challenge, the complexity, the scale, and the feeling of purpose,” she adds, when thinking about what she likes most about her job. “There’s nothing better than getting something out and it really helping people. That’s very satisfying.” Ready to make a difference?

5/9/2022,"Innovation isn’t confined to startups. Take DWP Digital’s Innovation Lab, for example. Few of us would automatically namecheck a massive organisation such as the Department for Work and Pensions – which has approximately 96,000 employees serving 20 million citizens – as an example of agile, creative thinking. But its Innovation Lab brings visionary, innovative, experimental thinking to all its services, to make them better for all their users – which is all of us. From claiming a pension to finding a job, most of us will be in that 20 million at some point in our lives. “For me, the Innovation Lab is a unique and safe space where we can explore and test different ideas and concepts,” says product lead Maxine Paintain. “It’s about creativity, networks and ecosystems. It’s about solving problems – reframing them, breaking them down and connecting them to new and different solutions that we discover through our proof of concepts and experiments. And it’s about leveraging the wider innovation ecosystem that exists across government, industry and academia to speed up transformation and change. We’re pushing the boundaries to accelerate the potential of new ideas.” So how does the Innovation Lab work? A project usually starts with a problem that’s drawn directly from the experiences of those 20 million users. “It’s an inherent risk in any big organisation that you start thinking about a problem in terms of your own structures,” says Simon King, head of user centred design. “Our approach means that we empathise with the citizen. We build our solutions and ways of working around that empathy, bringing citizens in, to co-design solutions.” For example, perhaps you’re taking on caring responsibilities for the first time but don’t know about the support and benefits available. If you have access to the right information, you’re less likely to give up work or suffer physical and mental stress – but it can be hard to find. Once a problem like this is identified, the team starts with a blank piece of paper as it looks for solutions. Then it moves fast. Using deep user research, the latest tech and all the expertise it can draw from across government and user groups, the team creates a problem-solving prototype in just six to eight weeks. Tech is a big part of what the Innovation Lab does, of course. Scanning the horizon for new tech and thinking about how it could be used is a big part of principle innovation lead Shruti Kohli’s role. For example, becoming more data-driven is one of DWP Digital’s strategic objectives – but sharing sensitive data so it can be analysed comes with big challenges. She is currently examining the possibilities of synthetic data – which doesn’t reveal the identity of an individual, giving huge potential for analysing and learning while maintaining confidentiality. There are no guarantees in this kind of work, she points out – and that’s a good thing. “The Innovation Lab is an uncertain kind of environment. You’re trying to do something differently, that nobody else has done, and you’re doing it in a six-to-eight-week window. It needs to be short and crisp because otherwise you lose the momentum and the creativity. It’s also important to have a space where you do not have to be 100% right all the time. The lab is an experimental space, a place where if you run a trial and fail, you can simply use the best bits and take it further.” But while new tech is key, it’s always the servant of the problem, never the master. “We bring in the latest tech, but we’re not a tech playground,” says King. “The point of us isn’t the tech, it’s how we can use tech differently to do something different for the user at the end point.” It’s a place with great potential for the right people. “We want people who can do something creative, who don’t like to do the same thing all the time,” says Kohli. “Collaboration and communication with team members and stakeholders are the key to working in this agile way.” King says he’s proud that the Innovation Lab is made up of a diverse range of people with different ages, backgrounds, ethnicities, and lived experiences. “We need that diversity, so we’re representative of the people we are solving the problem for. But diverse viewpoints also have a wonderful alchemy when it comes to innovation.” The lab looks for skills: holistic service design, data science, innovation expertise and development. But empathy is also key, says Paintain. “If you’re interested in people, in innovation and in making things better, and you have digital and data professional skill sets blended with innovation expertise, we have great opportunities for you. But you also need the desire to improve things and make things better, coupled with understanding and being aware of challenges and pain points for the citizens that we serve.” The UK is changing fast and the DWP is changing with it. It has ambitious and transformative plans to improve services and the Innovation Lab will play an important role in that future. “We solve really big problems that really matter,” says King. “We want people who want to do something important with their skill sets. And I can’t think of anything more important than the services we provide to so many people in the UK.” Ready to make a difference?

5/9/2022,"Chloe Williams didn’t plan to have a career in IT. After graduation, she spent a few successful years working in marketing, before taking time out to teach English in South Korea and travel in south-east Asia. On her return, prompted partly by the experience of meeting tech industry professionals on her travels, she took a three-month coding bootcamp in Leeds and joined an agency as a junior software developer. After a year, she was offered a job as a software engineer at DWP Digital, which employs about 4,000 people to deliver digital services for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Since joining in January 2021, she hasn’t looked back. Williams loves the job because she can see the difference she’s making to people’s lives. Based in Leeds, she is one of a team of four building and launching Restart, the government’s scheme to support people who have been out of work for nine months or more and which aims to give them the skills and support they need to find work. The team also maintains existing systems used by the DWP’s work coaches – the people who help individuals find a job and access financial support while they’re looking. It means there is plenty of variety, day-to-day. “Some days you’ll be working with cutting-edge technology, and then the next day you’ll be working on something that was built a decade ago, so there is a lot of context-switching.” Part of the software engineer role involves “getting your head down to write the code that turns into a feature for users”, Williams says. But there’s much more to it than that. Williams and her colleagues have to collaborate with designers, business analysts and user researchers. “You need to have good communication skills,” she says, including being able to translate technical terms into non-technical language. She and her colleagues find it helpful to sit in on sessions with work coaches, so they are able to hear how the software they have designed has benefited the coaches. Even just a few lines of code, she says, “might save a work coach a minute of time. And because there are so many work coaches in DWP, that adds up and ultimately frees them up to support more people.” Roy Holder’s journey into a role as a senior infrastructure engineer at DWP Digital was a little different. After several years working in IT, he joined BPDTS, a company created to provide digital technology services to DWP. When BPDTS was merged into DWP Digital, Holder took on the job of removing legacy contracts and building a new internal IT infrastructure. He was surprised to find a government department with such an innovative and up-to-date approach to technology. DWP Digital is, he says, “a really great place to work – modern and forward-thinking”. Holder is part of the specialist devices team, responsible for managing the department’s vast network of MacBooks, which are connected to cloud platforms rather than in-house servers. He and his colleagues need to make sure that the MacBooks, which include those used in jobcentres by the public, are compliant and secure. The department uses a lot of distributed systems (in which different components are spread across multiple computers), and these are monitored on a day-to-day basis to make sure they keep functioning. The team’s work is underpinned by site reliability engineering principles, which involve working at a rapid pace to create systems that are scalable, reliable, have minimum wastage and meet service level targets. Holder’s most recent project has involved migrating a legacy IT platform to a more modern one. Because it had to be completed before the old contract ran out at the end of the year, it has been particularly fast-paced. “It was only a small window, and there was very little downtime. We had to collaborate with a lot of our front-of-house staff at all the jobcentres just to get the new platform in and working, and make sure that it would do the job as well as the old platform did.” The biggest challenge was arranging shipment of more than 8,000 devices to more than 700 sites, including jobcentres. The successful migration has saved the department more than £250,000 a year. The qualities needed to do the infrastructure engineer role, Holder says, include “a love of IT, the desire to learn new things, and being up-to-date with the latest trends”. Like Williams, he enjoys seeing the positive impact his work has on others: “One of the best things for me particularly in this role is seeing the outcome – the things that the department is delivering. We try to provide services that are forward-thinking, modern and simple to use for citizens.” Both Holder and Williams find their roles challenging, but endlessly rewarding. As Williams says: “There are not many places where you can say that the things you are building as a software engineer are being used by such a huge scale of people. Millions of people use DWP’s services, and billions of pounds worth of benefits are paid out, so it’s both daunting and very exciting to be able to work on that.” Ready to make a difference?

5/9/2022,"Data is the lifeblood of organisations, the oil that keeps the machine turning. Once collected and scrutinised, it enables analysts to understand user behaviour, improve the quality of products and services offered, spot trends and predict demand. But it’s not as easy as it sounds. At the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), its store of 200 terabytes of data is growing at a rate of 10% a year, with an increasingly complex mix of sources – from documents to video and voice. It’s a phenomenal resource but one that the department has found challenging to make the best use of in the past. “It was mostly used around understanding our customer base, citizens as a whole, and big socio-economic movements,” says Charlie Boundy, deputy director for advanced analytics. “Now it’s increasingly about understanding our services, our performance and how we measure success.” Making better use of data is at the heart of the Digital Future strategy at DWP Digital, which also aims to deliver great services, build new user-centred solutions, and build capacity and capability. A move that helped to drive momentum was the establishment of DWP’s chief data office in October 2021. “We now have a tangible group within the department that takes responsibility for data governance, security and data enablement,” Emma Presley Abbott, head of enterprise insight, says. “That’s been a key part of making sure the exploitation of data becomes much easier and a much more common part of our ‘business as usual’. “We’ve realised we need to learn from the millions of transactions and interactions that we have with users, rather than just storing data to calculate a payment. There’s a real appetite all across the department, at all levels, to make the best use of the data that we have.” Presley Abbott’s team is responsible for the digital platform that acts as a one-stop-shop for the whole department, and facilitates the enterprise reporting service (delivering reports from data sources). She aims to tackle some of the main challenges that have prevented data from being used in a meaningful way – accessibility, data quality and traceability. “The ambition for my team is to make that data more readily available to colleagues so that it can be better used for decision making,” she says. “We want to make the whole data landscape feel like a part of everybody’s role, rather than this mysterious, abstract concept.” That’s already having results. Employment programmes such as Kickstart and Way to Work have been launched, evaluated and optimised within short timeframes to ensure they have the maximum impact. “You have to constantly and quite proactively monitor their rollout, providing the insight required to pull different levers, and make changes on the fly,” says Presley Abbott. Those reporting capabilities also came in handy during the Covid-19 pandemic, when the need for immediate access to accurate data was paramount, Boundy adds. “You can imagine with a stable economy and quite stable unemployment rates, people are usually happy to deal with data on a weekly or monthly basis. During the pandemic, everybody needed it, every day, every minute, in areas where we’d not shone a spotlight before. We had to mobilise to do a lot of very rapid insights and be a lot more reactive and responsive to user need.” The past two years have also opened up the possibility for cross-departmental data sharing, which Boundy is exploring through a pilot project with several government departments that aims to provide insights to aid economic recovery. “Historically departments have been, quite rightly, very nervous about any form of data sharing, because there’s a huge data protection risk,” says Boundy. “But we’re looking at how we can coordinate departments who’ve got a shared problem to target our efforts better.” New technologies are also being considered, such as machine learning, blockchain and cognitive computing. Boundy is clear that DWP Digital has already drawn hard lines around how and where artificial intelligence (AI) will be used. “There’s no appetite for automated decision making using artificial intelligence. Anything involved in entitlement or calculation of a payment does not have AI involved at all. Where it makes a big difference is in triaging work. Who needs a bit more support? Who needs a different type of service, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach? We want to get to a point where we are differentiating a service based on the specific needs of the customer.” DWP’s evolution to a fully data-centric organisation won’t happen overnight. But Presley Abbott says she’s excited to be part of the journey. “We provide services to millions of people, at real times of need in their lives. Being able to use data to make sure those services are working effectively and the customer experience is as good as it can be is quite hard to beat.” Ready to make a difference?

5/9/2022,"Labor has flagged an increase in aid to south-east Asia while ramping up its attack on Scott Morrison by accusing him of “bullying” behaviour that undermines Australia’s relationships with Pacific island countries. The opposition has promised to increase foreign aid to the Pacific by $525m over four years. Labor says the money would be additional funding and not involve redirecting aid from other parts of the world. The shadow minister for international development and the Pacific, Pat Conroy, said on Monday that south-east Asia would be “another key priority for us” and the Coalition’s cuts to aid to Indonesia had been “shortsighted”. The aid boost to south-east Asia is expected to be substantial but observers believe the figure is unlikely to be as high as the $525m for the Pacific and Timor-Leste. Labor has refused to spell out a specific timeframe for achieving its policy of lifting Australia’s overall foreign aid to at least 0.5% of gross national income. Official Development Assistance (ODA) has emerged as an election issue amid soul-searching in Canberra over the newly signed security deal between China and Solomon Islands. Beijing continues to push to expand areas of cooperation with Honiara across a range of other fields including fishing. Conroy said Australia needed to work with the region to “restore” the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) and to engage in a respectful way. He noted Australia had signed up to the 2018 Boe Declaration, reaffirming climate change as “the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific” and committing to action to implement the Paris agreement. “We’ve signed up to something, but not only do we ignore it, we actively sabotage it,” Conroy told an international development election forum at the Australian National University. “Mr Morrison’s behaviour at the 2019 PIF was an absolute disgrace and I say that very clearly. His arrogance, his bullying behaviour, not only was deeply disrespectful to our Pacific neighbours and undermined the PIF, it undermined Australia.” Conroy pointed to comments by Frank Bainimarama, the prime minister of Fiji, who described Morrison’s approach during the leaders’ retreat in Tuvalu 2019 as “very insulting and condescending”. In an exclusive interview with Guardian Australia, Bainimarama was asked whether Morrison’s approach might cause some Pacific leaders to look to China. “After what we went through with Morrison, nothing can be worse than him,” Bainimarama replied. “China never insults the Pacific … they don’t go down and tell the world that we’ve given this much money to the Pacific islands. They don’t do that. They’re good people, definitely better than Morrison, I can tell you that.” Vanuatu’s foreign minister, Ralph Regenvanu, previously told the Guardian that Australia had several “red lines” during negotiations that it refused to budge on, meaning Pacific leaders had to remove all references to coal, references to limiting warming to less than 1.5C and to setting out a plan for net zero emissions by 2050 from the forum communique and climate change statement that came out of the meeting. Conroy cited Bainimarama’s remark that Morrison’s behaviour would push Pacific countries towards China. “Look where we are now,” Conroy added. He said Labor’s pledge to restore bipartisan parliamentary visits to the region was important to build a sense of partnership. The joint travel by the then foreign affairs minister, Julie Bishop, and Labor’s Penny Wong had sent important signal about the bipartisan Australian commitment to Pacific, he said. Since the 2019 PIF blow-up, Morrison and Bainimarama have sought to rebuild their personal relationship. Morrison has repeatedly described the Pacific as “family” and vowed to work with them. But Conroy said on Monday: “Who needs family if they blatantly disregard an issue you see as your greatest threat?” Conroy said Morrison argued the government was committed to net zero by 2050 “but his Coalition is hopelessly divided on it”, with the leader of the Nationals, Barnaby Joyce, implying the target is non-binding. The Coalition has retained Tony Abbott’s formal target of a 26 to 28% cut in emissions on 2005 levels by 2030, even though it says it will likely overachieve that. Labor has pledged to cut emissions by 43% by 2030. Morrison said on Monday the government was “very aware of what’s happening in our region and of the pressures there are that the Chinese government is seeking to put on countries across our region”. The comment followed a report in the Australian newspaper that a draft maritime co-operation agreement outlined plans for China and Solomon Islands to co-operate to establish “deep-sea fishing bases” and develop oil, gas and undersea mining ventures. Morrison said he would work with the “broad family” of the PIF. He added that Australia’s ODA to the Pacific now stood at $1.85bn a year. The prime minister has repeatedly defended his government’s inability to prevent the security deal between China and Solomon Islands from proceeding, saying Beijing was exerting “enormous pressure” on countries in the region and did not “play by the same rules as transparent liberal democracies”. The trade minister, Dan Tehan, told Sky News on Monday: “In the end, sovereign countries make sovereign decisions but we have been working with the Pacific to ensure that they understand the importance of a free and open Pacific region.” Morrison’s office has been contacted for a response to Conroy’s comments.",News/Australia news,Labor signals more aid to south-east Asia and accuses Scott Morrison of ‘bullying behaviour’ towards Pacific,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/09/labor-signals-more-aid-to-south-east-asia-and-accuses-scott-morrison-of-bullying-behaviour-towards-pacific
5/9/2022,"Lewis Hamilton has conceded Mercedes have failed to improve their car over the opening five races of the season after he finished sixth at the Miami Grand Prix. The seven-time world champion admitted they were not going forwards with a car that his team principal, Toto Wolff, acknowledged remains off the pace and is a handful to drive and understand, as they consider dropping the design concept next year. Max Verstappen won the race for Red Bull, having passed Charles Leclerc for the lead on lap nine and then delivering a controlled and dominant drive to the flag. It was a consummate display from the Dutchman with Ferrari simply unable to match their pace. In so doing he closed to 19 points behind Leclerc in the championship. Mercedes had brought their first major upgrades of the season to Miami and were hopeful at least of making the incremental steps they required in order to extract more from their car, which is still suffering from the violent porpoising on the straights that has prevented them from unlocking its potential after five races. Hamilton did enjoy an improved qualifying performance, taking sixth and he and teammate George Russell finished sixth and fifth respectively in the race. However they remain up to almost a second a lap off the leaders and the hoped for improvement had not been discovered in Miami. “Unfortunately we are at the same speed as we were in the first race,” said Hamilton. “We haven’t improved in these five races but I am hopeful, we have to keep trying and keep working hard.” The British driver, used to vying at the front for wins and the title, has been in an altogether different battle this season. At very best his car is third fastest but Hamilton has often found himself in a midfield battle the likes of which he has rarely had to endure across his entire career. A challenge he is taking on the chin as a long season of a further 18 races lies ahead. “It’s still racing, just a different perspective, a different point of view,” he said. “You want to try and go forward but it is difficult when you are not going forwards. It is what it is but it’s an experience for sure.” Mercedes believe this year’s car still has the potential to come good and that should they solve their issues, it could yet be very quick, although Hamilton has already written off his title chances. In Miami their task was once more writ large with its unpredictable nature exposed. Russell had been quickest in second practice but then said he felt no confidence in the same car during qualifying, managing only 12th place. Wolff admitted that even after five races mastering the car remained a dark art and one that he described in a clearly frustrated fashion. “There is potential in the car and she is fast but we just don’t understand how to unlock the potential.” he said. “It is a car that is super difficult to drive, dipping in and out of the performance window – more out than in – and dissecting the data with a scalpel is a painful process. “The data sometimes doesn’t show what the drivers tell us and suddenly they have their hands full with a car that is not nice, comfortable or predictable to drive.” With the new regulations introduced this year a variety of different concepts across the grid were introduced by the teams and some such as leaders Ferrari and Red Bull have successfully solved the porpoising problem with their models. With decisions on what design route to go down on next year’s cars to be made in the near future Mercedes are approaching a crunch time for how they choose to move forward in 2023. In Miami Wolff singled out the next round at Barcelona as a key moment. “We have stayed committed to the current concept, we are faithful to the current concept, we are not looking at the lady next door to see if we like it more,” he said. “Before we make a decision on switching to another concept we need to understand where this one went wrong. What is the good and what is the bad. I would be asking for an answer after Barcelona and then we have to look ourselves in the mirror and ask: ‘Did we get it wrong or not?’.”",Sport/Sport,‘We haven’t improved’: Lewis Hamilton dispirited as car way off F1 pace again,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/09/f1-lewis-hamilton-dispirited-mercedes-car-way-off-pace-miami-gp
5/9/2022,"Vladimir Putin has told Russian soldiers they are “fighting for the same thing their fathers and grandfathers did” as he used his Victory Day speech to tie the war in Ukraine to the memory of the second world war and justify his invasion. Prior to the speech, foreign officials had said Putin could use it to launch a full mobilisation of Russian troops or formally declare war in Ukraine, but there were no large policy announcements. Instead he suggested Russia was “forced” into the war by Nato and pledged to provide aid for the families of soldiers who had died in what the Kremlin is calling a “special operation”. Speaking at the 77th annual celebration of the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Russian president launched a defence of his war in Ukraine, pivoting from a recognition of Russia’s “greatest generation” to a description of how it was believed Ukraine was being armed by the west for an imminent attack on Crimea, the peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. “Nato countries did not want to listen to us,” Putin said. “They had different plans, and we saw it. They were planning an invasion into our historic lands, including Crimea … Russia gave a preemptive rebuff to aggression, it was a forced, timely and only right decision.” He also described the war as “sacred”. “The defence of the motherland, when its fate was being decided, has always been sacred,” Putin said, speaking of the second world war. “And now, you are fighting for our people in the Donbas. For the security of our homeland – Russia.” The Russian president also addressed troop losses in the war, saying he had signed a new order that would give additional aid to the families of those killed and wounded. The Kremlin has been accused of seeking to cover up losses. After the sinking of the Moskva cruiser in the Black Sea, a number of families went public with claims the Russian military was trying to avoid confirming deaths onboard the ship. “The death of each of our soldiers and officers is a grief for all of us and an irreparable loss for relatives and friends,” Putin said. “The state, regions, enterprises, public organisations will do everything to take care of such families and help them. We will provide special support to the children of the dead and wounded comrades. The presidential decree on this was signed today.”",News/World news,Putin ties Ukraine invasion to second world war in Victory Day speech,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/putin-ties-ukraine-invasion-second-world-war-victory-day-speech-russia
5/9/2022,"Large parts of Queensland are again bracing for wild weather, with the Bureau of Meteorology warning some areas including Townsville and the Sunshine Coast could be hit by record May rainfall. The BoM issued a flood watch for western and central Queensland and the central and north tropical coast on Monday afternoon with already saturated catchments at an increased risk of flash flooding and landslips. The worst of the weather is expected to arrive on Tuesday when an unseasonably moist, north-easterly flow across the state’s north combines with a strengthening upper trough over central Australia, producing a cloud band that will bring widespread heavy rainfall from the morning. “Showers and thunderstorms across the state are expected to transition into widespread areas of rain over the coming days, with some heavy rainfall expected,” the BoM said in a statement on Monday afternoon. “Some locations including Townsville, the Central West, Herbert/Burdekin and the Sunshine Coast may receive their highest May rainfall on record this week.” Weatherzone meteorologist Ben Domensino said parts of central western Queensland could get five times the monthly average of rainfall in a matter of days. The showers were expected to develop across central and north-western parts of the state, shifting east on Wednesday and Thursday and redeveloping along the east coast. “It’s very unusual to have a rainfall event of this magnitude in Queensland in May,” Domensino said. “May is typically the time of year you’ve moved out of the wet season … Longreach averages 23mm of rain during an entire month, there’s potential to see more than 200mm over the next 24 to 48 hours.” Intense rainfall with dangerous thunderstorms and life-threatening flash flooding was possible for the central west and parts of the north-west districts, with six-hourly falls of up to 150mm expected. Severe Weather Warning issued for the Central West and North West, including #Longreach, #Winton and #Richmond. Heavy rainfall to develop overnight, leading to flash and riverine flooding. Widespread impacts to transport anticipated, make preparations now. https://t.co/AIjm0HhHlB pic.twitter.com/XQbdgzn50E Major flooding was likely in some areas from Tuesday evening, which could cause widespread transport disruptions in central western Queensland. Longreach, Winton, Cloncurry, Isisford, Barcaldine, Hughenden, Richmond, Julia Creek and Blackall were forecast to be hardest hit by the storms. A severe weather warning was also in place for Gulf Country, Northern Goldfields, Upper Flinders and Channel County. Six-hourly falls between 60 and 100mm were likely. If you know you’ll be out and about next week, have a Plan B so you know what to do if you’re faced with flooded roads on your usual way to work, home, or school. Remember, if it’s flooded, forget it!https://t.co/AK5BdTC3JV📸 Dalby (file image) pic.twitter.com/JwfFCHUxsK About 31 catchments in northern, western and eastern Queensland north of Bowen still wet from rainfall of the past few weeks were on flood watch, with some still experiencing flooding from previous weather events. There were 10 flood warnings in place across the state on Monday morning including possible major flooding along the Cooper Creek at Windorah south of Longreach. Domensino said the prolonged period of rain would last until Friday or Saturday, with some unpredictability towards the end of the event depending on where the upper level trough moved. “Tuesday it’s inland, Wednesday it’s moving towards the coast and Thursday and Friday are a bit harder to predict,” he said. “Some models have it over the central coast and some down near the south-east coast by Friday. Some models are predicting the heaviest rain to be up over the central coast or down near south-east Queensland including Brisbane. “The weather warning is likely to extend farther east towards central coast or north tropical coast on Wednesday … that means there’ll be rain right up and down the coast from Cape York to the south-east.” The landscape in south-east Queensland is still saturated, which would make it more prone to flooding in the event of heavy rain, Domensino said. “Soil moisture is above average for most of Queensland at the moment,” he said. “And in the west of state it’s very flat … you’d expect on Wednesday that much rain falling over flat areas would likely cut off roads and cause quite a lot of flash flooding and riverine flooding.” River levels were easing in the Thomson, Barcoo and Cooper catchments but renewed level rises were possible from Tuesday onwards as further heavy rainfall hit the region. The Cooper Creek’s main channel was sitting at 5.49 metres and falling on Monday morning, but was expected to remain above the major flood level of 5 metres into Tuesday. Meanwhile, river rises were expected to remain above the Diamantina Lakes Causeway with heavy rainfall forecast for the upper Diamantina and Western River catchments throughout the week. While river levels were easing along the upper Diamantina River, they were rising farther downstream with thunderstorms and possible heavy falls forecast for coming days. The Diamantina River at Diamantina Lakes was sitting around 2.53 metres above the causeway level on Springvale Diamantine Lakes Road on Monday morning. A moderate flood warning was also in place for Eyre Creek, with minor flooding possible at the Georgina River south of Mount Isa. The Bureau of Meteorology said there was still uncertainty about where the heaviest falls would be later in the week, with warnings to “continue to be refined” in coming days. Domensino said La Niña was “fuelling” the weather event as it was causing more moisture to flow towards Australia. “Climate change is more of a background signal to all the weather events we’re experiencing,” he said.",News/Australia news,Parts of Queensland expecting highest May rainfall on record with storms to lash state,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/09/parts-of-queensland-expecting-highest-may-rainfall-on-record-with-storms-to-lash-state
5/9/2022,"Morrisons has reportedly beaten the owners of Asda in the race to buy McColl’s, the struggling convenience store chain that is expected to be put into administration as soon as Monday morning. The bid from Morrisons is due to be announced as the preferred bidder for McColl’s, despite an improved offer from EG Group, the petrol forecourts operator owned by the Blackburn-based Issa Brothers, according to Sky News. McColl’s is to be sold via a pre-pack administration, after the Scotland-based retailer’s lenders declined a request to restructure its debt. That sparked a bid battle for the London-listed company, which employs 16,000 people across 1,100 shops in the UK. Morrisons, Britain’s fourth biggest grocer, already has a supply agreement with McColl’s, to which it provides a range of products under the Safeway brand. Morrisons was bought out by the US private equity group Clayton, Dubilier & Rice last year. The professional services firm PwC is overseeing the administration process on behalf of McColl’s lenders. EG Group had offered to take responsibility for McColl’s pension scheme, in its effort to match Morrisons. EG’s owners, Mohsin and Zuber Issa, also own the Asda supermarket chain, and it is understood they had offered to align pay for the lowest-paid McColl’s staff with the supermarket and the broader EG Group at £10.05 an hour. PwC and EG Group declined to comment.
