3/25/2022,"Labor has promised an independent review of Australia’s carbon credit system if it wins government, saying it is concerned about whistleblower allegations the scheme is “largely a sham” that was wasting money and not reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Chris Bowen, the opposition climate change and energy spokesman, said carbon credits were “very important”, would be “increasingly important” and Labor wanted to ensure the system had integrity. Prof Andrew Macintosh, who spent years working on carbon credit integrity as the head of the government’s emissions reduction assurance committee, this week described the system as a fraud that was hurting the environment and had wasted more than $1bn in taxpayer funding. He said all the major methods approved by the government to create carbon credits had “serious integrity issues, either in their design or the way they are being administered”. They included projects for regrowing native forests in cleared areas, projects to protect existing trees so they were not cleared and projects at landfill sites to capture and use methane emissions. Macintosh is an Australian National University environment law professor who has been appointed to several senior roles by the Coalition, including as a royal commissioner examining Australia’s natural disaster response after the Black Summer bushfires. Bowen said he had already had concerns “for some time” after previous allegations there were integrity issues with carbon credits. “This report by Prof McIntosh was concerning. Now carbon trading, Australian credit units, are very important and will be increasingly important, including under us, and I support the carbon trading system,” he told the ABC’s Radio National. “But I also want to ensure that they do have integrity.” He said Labor had already promised, as part of the climate change policy it released in December, it would commission a quick review of the carbon market that would consider integrity and other issues, including how it interacted with efforts to improve biodiversity, if it wins the election expected in May. “I am not a scientist. I would want independent advice giving me the confidence, and the Australian people the confidence, that the [carbon credit] market is functioning as it should and that is what we would deliver if we do win the election,” Bowen said. “I would welcome [energy and emissions reduction minister] Angus Taylor making a similar commitment.” Carbon credits are used by the government and polluting companies as an alternative to cutting carbon dioxide emissions. Instead of reducing their own pollution, they can choose to buy carbon credits that are meant to represent a reduction in emissions elsewhere. Each carbon credit represents one tonne of carbon dioxide that has either been stopped from going in the atmosphere, or sucked out of it. Methods approved to generate carbon credits in Australia include regenerating native forest that has been cleared, protecting a forest that would otherwise have been cleared (known as “avoided deforestation”) and capturing and using emissions that leak from landfill sites to generate electricity. Credits are bought by the government through the $4.5bn taxpayer-funded emissions reduction scheme or by polluters on the private market.  The Greens said they had referred Macintosh’s allegations to the national auditor general. The party’s leader, Adam Bandt, called for a “full, independent inquiry”. “When the former head of the government’s emissions reduction assurance committee reveals that the carbon credits scheme is ‘largely a scam’, we need an open transparent inquiry with powers to get to the bottom of it,” he said. “This is a critical issue. Both the Morrison government and Labor are claiming to take climate seriously while planning to open up 114 new coal and gas projects, relying on permits and offsets to cover up their duplicity. If carbon credits are fraudulent too, then Australia will definitely blow its climate targets.” The Greens’ agriculture spokesman, Peter Whish-Wilson, said the allegations about carbon credits risked undermining the goodwill of farmers who wanted to “do their bit for climate change”. The carbon credits system is managed by the Clean Energy Regulator, a government agency. It is responsible for designing and regulating carbon credit methods, advising the Emissions Reduction Assurance Committee that oversees the integrity of the methods and buying credits on behalf of the government. The regulator has rejected Macintosh’s assertions, saying both it and the committee had undertaken considerable work using independent experts to test previous claims made by Macintosh and found no evidence to support them. It said it had “well established and rigorous processes” to address potential conflicts of interest that arose from it both developing carbon credits methods and issuing and buying credits, and that the $4.5bn emissions reduction fund – through which the government buys credits from landholders and businesses – was a “robust offsets scheme with a high degree of integrity”. Macintosh said problems with the system included a lack of transparency. He called on the regulator to release data not currently in the public domain that it relied on to say the system was working, and said there should be an independent inquiry into the failures of the system with the power to compel people to give evidence. The chair of the regulator, David Parker, told the ABC he would be “more than happy” to make the data public but the law prevented the release of data from the precise areas where the carbon farming occurred. Only information related to the full project area, which is much larger and was what Macintosh and his colleagues had examined in several new reports released on Thursday, could be released. “If the law was changed I’d be perfectly happy to put that data out,” Parker said. John Connor, chief executive of the Carbon Market Institute, which represents businesses making commitments to cut emissions, said the organisation took claims about the integrity of the carbon market seriously and would consider Macintosh’s new analysis. He said methods to create carbon credits were subject to regular reviews so they could be improved. “[The institute] supports continuous improvement in method development and implementation,” he said. Macintosh said he believed the initial errors in how carbon credits were issued were unintentional, but subsequently attempts had been made to cover up those mistakes. More recently, as demand for credits increased with fossil fuel companies under pressure to show they were addressing the climate crisis, he believed the government had made a conscious decision to prioritise building an abundant supply of cheap offsets over ensuring their integrity. A spokesperson for Taylor said on Wednesday that Macintosh had reviewed and signed off on methods that he now said lacked integrity. Macintosh said he attempted to address the problems with carbon credits while on the committee but had limited success, and regretted he had not taken a stronger stance on some issues. He said he had continued to try to persuade the regulator and other officials of the need to act in the two years since he left the committee before deciding to go public.",News/Environment,Labor promises review of Australia’s carbon credit system after allegations it is ‘largely a sham’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/25/labor-promises-review-of-australias-carbon-credit-system-after-allegations-it-is-largely-a-sham
3/25/2022,"The UK’s ministry of defence said Ukraine is striking “high value targets” that is forcing Russian forces to divert resources to defend their supply lines. It cited the attacks on landing ship and ammunition storage depots at Berdyansk as examples of valuable targets. “It is likely that the Ukrainians will continue to target logistical assets in Russian-held areas. This will force the Russian military to prioritise the defence of their supply chain” and reduce ability to carry out offensive operations. Ukrainian forces have been bolstered by the destruction of the major Russian landing ship as it brought in supplies to its troops. Dramatic pictures showed billowing fire and black smoke as the Orsk, docked in Berdyansk on the Azov Sea, was hit by Ukrainian ballistic missiles. Joe Biden heads to Warsaw on Friday where he is expected to meet with experts on the humanitarian response; and US troops stationed in Poland. On Saturday, he is to meet Polish counterpart Andrzej Duda to discuss “the humanitarian and human rights crisis” resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Ukrainian defence ministry said its troops had pushed back Russian forces from some areas around the capital, Kyiv. Russian troops did not have enough resources to push ahead with their offensive in Ukraine, Oleksander Motuzyanyk, Ukraine’s defence ministry spokesperson said, but added that Russian troops had not given up hope of surrounding and seizing Kyiv. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister said there were 40 buses waiting to take civilians out of Mariupol, but that Russian forces were not letting them through. There were meant to be seven humanitarian corridors open on Thursday – although Mariupol was not included among them. Ukraine has accused Moscow of forcibly taking 402,000 civilians, including 84,000 children, from Ukrainian cities to Russia - and raised concerns that they would be used as hostages. Russia corroborated the numbers but said the civilians has been evacuated willingly. The chief prosecutor of the international criminal court (ICC), Karim Khan, asked a coalition of countries to back his war crimes investigation in Ukraine. “Things can get worse” if the international community fails to act now, Khan warned. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, appealed to Nato allies to increase military support for his country against Russian forces. Speaking to leaders via video link, Zelenskiy thanked countries for the defensive equipment provided to Ukraine but appealed for offensive weapons. The Ukrainian leader also accused Russia of deploying phosphorus weapons. Nato leaders have agreed to strengthen their defences in the east in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. About 40,000 troops have been placed on its eastern flank along with significant air and naval assets, and four new battlegroups will be sent to Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania. The US and its allies announced new sanctions on more than 400 Russian elites and institutions. Among those sanctioned were Russia’s lower house of parliament, the Duma, and 328 of its members. The US treasury department also issued guidance, warning that US authorities may impose sanctions on gold-related transactions involving Russia. Biden said China understands the economic consequences that would ensue if it provides help to Russia in its war with Ukraine. Speaking to reporters in Brussels, the US president said the Nato alliance has never been more united than it is today. G7 leaders said they are resolved to impose severe consequences on Russia and stand ready to apply additional measures “as required”. In a joint statement, they condemned Vladimir Putin’s “war of choice” and his “unjustifiable, unprovoked and illegal” aggression in Ukraine. The Biden administration and the European Union are expected to announce a major initiative to direct shipments of liquefied natural gas to Europe during the US president’s visit to Brussels this week, the Washington Post reported, citing three US officials familiar with the plan. Russia has been hit with 65 new sanctions by the UK, in a move the Foreign Office said was designed to target “key strategic industries and individuals”. Among those hit were six banks and a defence company that produces drones, as well as the Wagner Group, which Britain said had reportedly been tasked with assassinating the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The UK and allies will “ramp up” lethal aid to Ukraine, Boris Johnson said following a meeting of G7 leaders. The UK will send an additional 6,000 missiles and provide £25m in funding for Ukraine’s armed forces, he said, with kit provided “in the quantity and with the quality” needed by Ukraine to defend itself against “its bullying neighbour”. Asked about the Kremlin’s claim that he was the “most active participant in the race to be anti-Russian”, Boris Johnson said he was not “remotely anti-Russian”. “I think I’m probably the only prime minister in UK history to be called Boris,” he told reporters in Brussels. The United Nations general assembly voted overwhelmingly to call on Russia to stop its war on Ukraine immediately and to provide more aid access and civilian protection in Ukraine. The resolution received 140 votes in favour and five votes against - Russia, Syria, North Korea, Eritrea and Belarus - while 38 countries abstained. Pope Francis levelled strong criticism against countries for increasing defence spending following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, describing it as “madness”. He said the conflict in Ukraine was a product of “the old logic of power that still dominates so-called geopolitics” and the real answer was not more weapons and more sanctions. Alexander Lukashenko, the authoritarian leader of Belarus, has warned that a Polish proposal to deploy a western peacekeeping force in Ukraine could trigger “world war three”. Lukashenko, who has allowed Russia to use Belarus’ territory to send troops into Ukraine, said on Thursday that should Poland’s suggestion be taken up “it will mean world war three”. The peacekeeping idea or any other direct Nato intervention has previously attracted no support from the US or many other allies.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 30 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-30-of-the-invasion

3/25/2022,"The Australian government publicly pledged to buy 70,000 tonnes of thermal coal from miner Whitehaven to donate to Ukraine before finalising the cost to the taxpayer – and failed to approach at least one other major coalminer to gauge their interest. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, on Sunday announced the federal government was buying coal from Whitehaven to donate to the Ukrainian government, with the assistance of Poland, to help provide energy security to the war-torn nation. The announcement was welcomed by Ukraine and trumpeted by the Coalition which publicly thanked Whitehaven, a Liberal donor, for its assistance. The government pledged to pay the entire cost of supplying and transporting the coal. The price of coal has surged to unprecedented levels due to Russia’s invasion of its neighbour. The federal resources minister, Keith Pitt, said on Wednesday the cost of acquiring the coal and sending it to Ukraine was “still being finalised” three days after the government publicly committed to the purchase. Guardian Australia made inquiries with several major coalminers, one of whom confirmed they had not been approached. New Hope Group, an Australian-owned coalminer, said it had “not been approached by the federal government” in relation to the deal to donate thermal coal to Ukraine. Glencore, another major coalminer, declined to comment about whether it had been approached. BHP and Yancoal did not respond to requests for comment. Pitt said he had contacted Whitehaven management directly. Asked whether he approached other resource companies at the same time he said Whitehaven was “the first company to give a positive response to the request”. “Given the urgency of the request I contacted Whitehaven management directly who indicated they could provide the coal for Ukraine without disrupting existing contracts despite high international demand,” Pitt said. Estimates based on current coal prices have suggested 70,000 tonnes of thermal coal is worth at least $31m. The volume of coal would reportedly only power a medium-sized coal-fired generator for three to five days. Ukraine, which first made the request to Australia, says it would welcome any further coal the government can provide. Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia, Volodymyr Shalkivskyi, said Ukraine had not nominated any single amount of coal when it requested help from the Australian government. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The request was that we would appreciate any amount of assistance, any amount of coal that you would find possible and relevant to provide in this situation,” the ambassador said. “So we are grateful for what was announced and we would welcome any additional steps in the future if the Australian government finds it’s possible.” Since the 2013-14 financial year, Whitehaven Coal has declared $140,000 in donations, all to the Liberal party. Guardian Australia is not suggesting those donations played any role in the decision to procure the coal through Whitehaven. Pitt rubbished the notion that donations were a factor, stating: “The only motivation was to meet Ukraine’s request to supply the coal as quickly as we can to meet the urgent energy needs of the country’s people. Any suggestion otherwise is rubbish.” Pitt said he had no contact with Whitehaven’s chair, former deputy prime minister and Nationals leader Mark Vaile, about the deal. The minister said the resources department was speaking with other coal producers about whether they could supply more coal to Europe. “The department has also [been] engaging with all Australian coal producers who may be able to assist meet any shortfalls among European friends,” he said. “They’ve all indicated they will help where they can.” Idemitsu Australia, which owns the Boggabri coalmine, said it was not approached directly about potentially supplying coal to Ukraine but its chief executive, Steve Kovac, said it was working as part of an “industry response to the government’s request for assistance”. Morrison said on Sunday when announcing the Whitehaven deal that finding thermal coal that was not already tied up in export contracts was difficult. “When we had to put this together, Minister Pitt, who’s done a terrific job on this, was able to work with them to access those coal supplies and then to be able to work through to arrange the shipping at very short notice,” the prime minister said. “Much of Australia’s coal exports are contracted. And so this was not a simple matter, and it was able to be resolved quite quickly.”",News/Australia news,Coalition went ‘directly’ to Whitehaven to purchase coal for Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/25/coalition-went-directly-to-whitehaven-to-purchase-coal-for-ukraine
