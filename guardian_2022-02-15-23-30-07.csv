2/15/2022,"Boris Johnson said he was not yet convinced by Russia’s announcement that it was withdrawing troops from the borders of Ukraine, saying: “The intelligence we are seeing is not encouraging.” The UK prime minister was speaking shortly after an emergency Cobra meeting, which reviewed the crisis situation. He said there were “mixed signals” coming from Russia, with some military build-up still taking place near Ukraine.  “We’ve got Russian field hospitals being constructed near the border with Ukraine in Belarus [that] only can be construed as preparation for an invasion,” Johnson said in a clip broadcast at lunchtime. “You’ve got more [Russian] battalion tactical groups actually been brought closer to the border with Ukraine, according to the intelligence that we’re seeing.” The cautious assessment contrasts with Russian defence ministry statements that it is withdrawing troops from is southern and western military districts, supported by footage that appeared to be shot in Crimea. Nevertheless, Johnson also said “we are seeing a Russia openness to conversations” and that “we think there is an avenue for diplomacy,” based on remarks coming from the Kremlin. On Monday, Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, told Vladimir Putin to continue and expand negotiations with the west. Reflecting on that and similar exchanges, Johnson said: “So we are seeing mixed signals, I think, at the moment.” Britain’s embassy in Kyiv will be kept open, Johnson said, in contrast with the US announcement made last night to relocate all its embassy staff and operations to Lviv in the west of Ukraine. The prime minister said: “One of the things we want to do is to show the UK his continued support for Ukraine, for stability in Ukraine – and I believe that keeping our embassy going for as long as possible is an important symbol.” The Cobra meeting reviewed the security situation. On Monday, it emerged that Britain believed that Russia was in the process of sending thousands more troops to the borders of Ukraine, with another 14 battalions to join the 100 already positioned near its neighbour. The UK, working in conjunction with the US and the EU, has threatened to bring forward sanctions against Russian oligarchs close to the Kremlin if Russia was to launch an invasion. Johnson repeated that an economic crime bill would be brought forward in the next session of parliament – a commitment that had briefly been dropped, prompting the resignation of the Lords Treasury minister, Theodore Agnew. The prime minister also committed to introducing registers that would spell out the beneficial ownership of luxury properties and businesses in the UK, as part of the legislation. The planned measure, he said, would be to “open up the Matryoshka doll if you like” so see “who really owns the companies that we’re talking about, who really owns the properties that we’re talking about”.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson says Russia is sending ‘mixed signals’ on Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/15/boris-johnson-russia-mixed-signals-ukraine
2/15/2022,"Former Post Office workers who were among those wrongfully convicted for theft, fraud and false accounting have called for the company’s former management to go to jail for their part in the long-running scandal. More than 700 Post Office operators were prosecuted between 2000 and 2014, based on evidence from the Horizon IT system, which was installed and maintained by Fujitsu.  Damian Owen, who was manager of a Post Office branch in Bangor, north Wales, was jailed for eight months after he was accused of stealing £25,000 as a result of computer errors. His conviction was quashed in 2021. Owen was at times lost for words as he told the inquiry into the scandal about his time in prison. “I lost an awful lot of weight,” Owen told the inquiry. “I did what I could to pass the time as quickly as I could.” Owen said the £25,000 hole in his branch accounts appeared shortly after Horizon system was installed, and he knew the figures didn’t add up. “We never held that amount of money there. It was a small branch,” Owen said. “As far as I was aware, the most held there was £13,000.” Owen was giving evidence to the second day of the inquiry into the human impact of the failings of the company’s software. The inquiry is part of an investigation into one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in British legal history. Some of the convicted workers were sent to prison, others lost their livelihoods and their homes. Many went bankrupt, and some died before their names were cleared. The inquiry, which is being chaired by the retired high court judge Sir Wyn Williams, is expected to hear evidence from about 60 former Post Office workers over the coming weeks. Owen called for former Post Office management to face charges. “I want there to be convictions, not only for the people who have perpetuated the whole conspiracy inside the Post Office, everyone from the top down who knew and was still pushing charges,” he said. “I want charges against people not only in my court case who came to give evidence and lied under oath, I want each of them to receive a perjury charge.” Lorraine Margery Williams, a former Post Office operator from Anglesey, also called for prosecutions of former Post Office managers. “I want them to go to jail for what they have done. But that would be an easy life for them. They’d come out and still have their money,” she said. “I want them to feel the way I felt and the way we suffered financially. I just want somebody to be accountable. “It has gone on for so long and people are hiding. Somebody has got to be accountable for this.” Williams, who received a suspended prison sentence in 2012 before her conviction was quashed in 2021, said she had struggled to find work after her conviction, which also caused her family’s mortgage repayments to quadruple. Williams said the experience had profoundly affected her, her husband and her daughter. “I was a recluse, I wouldn’t go out. I still don’t feel I am the same person. I get angry at times,” she said. “I don’t trust anybody any more and it’s difficult.” The inquiry continues.",News/Business,Wrongly convicted Post Office workers say former bosses should face jail,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/15/wrongly-convicted-post-office-workers-inquiry-horizon-it
2/15/2022,"The progressive New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez believes the Republican-led pressure on political systems is so great that there is “a very real risk” democracy will cease to exist in the US within a decade. The leftist Democratic politician derided efforts by Republican legislatures around the country to restrict voting rights as the “opening salvos” in a war on democracy, which she said could result in a return to the Jim Crow era disenfranchisement of racial minorities.  In the interview with the New Yorker, she warned that the clock was ticking for Joe Biden and other Democratic leaders to do anything about it, with huge chunks of the president’s agenda, including legislation to protect voting rights, stalled in Congress by more conservative or moderate members of her own party. “Honestly, it is a shitshow,” Ocasio-Cortez said of working in the same Democratic-controlled Congress in which centrist senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema have blocked both electoral reforms and Biden’s ambitious Build Back Better social spending initiative. “We don’t have much time,” she said. “The president has not been using his executive power to the extent that some would say is necessary.” The issue of voting rights was a dominant theme of the interview with New Yorker editor David Remnick, who asked her about her previous use of the phrase: “If we have a democracy 10 years from now.” “There’s a very real risk that we will not,” she said. “What we risk is having a government that perhaps postures as a democracy, and may try to pretend that it is, but isn’t. “We’ve already seen the opening salvos of this, where you have a very targeted, specific attack on the right to vote across the United States, particularly in areas where Republican power is threatened by changing electorates and demographics. “You have white-nationalist, reactionary politics starting to grow into a critical mass… the continued sophisticated takeover of our democratic systems in order to turn them into undemocratic systems, all in order to overturn results that a party in power may not like.” Although she believes the situation “is not beyond hope”, Ocasio-Cortez fears inaction will lead to a “return to Jim Crow”, a reference to repressive laws in the US south to the mid-20th century designed to enforce racial segregation and disenfranchise Blacks. “You have it already happening in Texas, where Jim Crow-style disenfranchisement laws have already been proposed,” she said. “You have the complete erasure and attack on our own understanding of history, to replace teaching history with institutionalized propaganda from white-nationalist perspectives in our schools. This is what the scaffolding of Jim Crow was. “The question we’re really facing is, was the last 50 to 60 years after the Civil Rights Act just a mere flirtation that the United States had with a multiracial democracy that we will then decide was inconvenient for those in power? And we will revert to what we had before?”",News/US news,Ocasio-Cortez: ‘Very real risk’ US democracy won’t exist in 10 years,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/15/aoc-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-democracy
2/15/2022,"The impact of the first year of Brexit on Ireland has been revealed after official data showed cross-border trade between the republic and Northern Ireland jumped by €2.8bn (£2.3bn) in 2021. Full-year figures from Ireland’s Central Statistics Office show that imports from Northern Ireland to the Irish republic were up 65% to €3.9bn, a rise of €1.5bn compared with 2020.  Exports from the republic to Northern Ireland also rocketed, up 54% to €3.7bn, an increase of €1.3bn compared with 2020 – a total trade bump of €2.8bn. The breakdown of figures show the biggest increase in trade in both directions was in food and live animals, with exports to NI up from €919bn to €1.35bn year on year, while imports to the republic were up from €714m to €1.02bn. The past year also saw a tripling in the value of imports of chemicals and related products to the republic from NI up from €280m in 2020 to €850m in 2021 with big rises also in imports of fuel. As no contemporary trade figures are published by the UK government or the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency for goods crossing the Irish sea from Great Britain into Northern Ireland, it is impossible to tell how much of the increase in trade is a result of the new trade barriers created by the Northern Ireland Brexit protocol. Nonetheless, they will be seized on by protocol critics, including unionist parties, as confirmation that Brexit has boosted NI’s trade with Ireland. The CSO figures, published on Tuesday, also show the impact of trade barriers erected between Ireland and Britain as a result of the UK’s departure from the EU, with a trade deficit opening up. Exports from Ireland to Great Britain were up 17% across the year to almost €14.4bn, but imports plummeted by 13% to €15.4bn. There was a drop of just over €2.3bn in exports from Great Britain to Ireland. The UK was Ireland’s single biggest trading partner before Brexit. The UK is now neck and neck with the US as the largest single non-EU source of goods imported to Ireland, accounting for 20% of trade at around €2bn apiece. However, the CSO figures suggest traders are becoming accustomed to the Brexit barriers that came into force on 1 January 2020. They show a massive drop in imports from GB between December 2020 and January 2021 when the new rules came into force but slowly rising over the year. Data for December show that the decline in imports from GB slowed by the end of the year, down 4% compared with December 2020. The main decreases were seen in imports of food and live animals, machinery and transport equipment. Levels of exports to GB were less volatile across the year with no comparable sharp fall in January last year. This may be put down to better Brexit preparedness in Ireland compared with Britain. Exports for December 2021 compared with December 2020 were down 5%, with greatest decreases in exports of food and live animals. The steady export trade also suggests Brexit has not caused the diversion in trade to GB suggested by the use of new Brexit-busting ferries that go direct to France and Belgium allowing exporters to bypass the so-called “landbridge” to the EU. Preliminary figures for 2021 show that Ireland enjoyed a bumper year with exports at highest on record, exceeding €165bn. The largest increases were in medical and pharmaceutical products a reflection of the strong presence of large companies such as Pfizer, one the of manufacturers of Covid vaccines, in Ireland.",News/Politics,Brexit: figures show huge jump in trade between Northern Ireland and republic,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/15/brexit-trade-figures-northern-ireland-republic
2/15/2022,"Before the pandemic, I was an artist, activist, teacher, director and producer – living fully, despite having had blood cancer for 10 years. Today, I am classified as “A3” (a person with comorbidities) in the Philippines. In the UK, I am classified as extremely clinically vulnerable. I don’t believe in labels, yet all of a sudden, I am one. Although I am fully vaccinated and boosted, there are no guarantees that the vaccines work in a body that has a suppressed immune system, like mine.  So I continue to isolate and shield in place. Largely alone. Before, community was my life. Now, loved ones are cautious about seeing me without isolating and testing beforehand, as they don’t want to put me at risk. In the Philippines, where we have no free tests, this is a big consideration. Freedom comes with the ability to pay. When two friends committed to quarantining and testing before spending time with me by the sea, I fell into their arms weeping when they arrived. I had almost forgotten what it was like to be held. Remembering hurts, and keeping that memory from fading is exhausting. What happens to the body after two years of no touch, no physical community, while managing a blood condition? It is in constant pain. I have always had cancer side-effects, but they eased in the arms of loved ones – in shared laughter, activism, movement building, dancing and adventures. The loss of a life that was free, that this body used to know, is heartbreaking. A life with touch, hugs, intimacy, pleasure, love, exploration, fun, joy, wildness. A body in isolation is sorrow. It is a deep longing, searching, endless waiting, and loneliness. People talk of herd or natural immunity, of fewer quarantine days, of more relaxed protocols. But I can’t visualise what that looks like for someone like me, and for the millions of people around the world with autoimmune diseases. “Mild” Covid is not something we can count on. As waves come and go, “freedom” still feels like a possible death sentence for us. Then you begin to live with another kind of pain: the pain of being left behind, while the world is moving on. But inside the sorrow of this body’s isolation remains the possibility of life. I manage the pain and loneliness with kundalini yoga, meditation, Tantra and divine feminine practice; by playing with my dog and learning to be a child again, creating art, beauty and sacred spaces in my home. My work as an activist and artist with One Billion Rising keeps me going. Every day, I get up, contribute, connect, reclaim and rise, to make this body a vessel of hope. These are my radical acts. One day soon, we will all be dancing together again.

2/15/2022,"Deliverance meets The Hangover in this wacky-but-slapdash horror-comedy from Kazakhstan. It’s juvenile, crass and gross-out, with funny bits depressingly few and far between. Daniar Alshinov is Dastan, a man who is under the cosh of his pregnant wife Zhanna (Asel Kaliyeva); her only personality trait is that she’s a nagging ballbreaker. Though to be fair, most of the characters here feel like one-dimensional stereotypes. As a last hurrah before the birth of the baby, Dastan has arranged to go fishing with two old buddies. One of them, Arman (Azamat Marklenov) owns an online sex toy business, so arrives with a camper van full of cheapo factory seconds blow-up dolls. Things get steadily more unhilarious from there. An excruciating set piece on the road involves one of the trio pissing in bottle and throwing it out the window; only the window is shut. More comedy mishap ensues on the dinghy, when a fishing hook catches Arman in the ear, ripping clean through the ear lobe (weirdly, with very little blood).  Things get worse, sub-Fargo style, when the three men witness a group of clownish mobsters accidentally shooting a man in the face. The mean guys give chase. But wouldn’t you know, an even meaner guy, a one-eyed serial killer, arrives on the scene. He’s the strong, silent survivalist type, who can rip a man’s jaw apart with his bare hands. Admittedly, I’m not the target audience for this brand of infantile humour. But I’m not sure even a film aimed at six-year-olds could get away with a gag involving a man hiding behind a door from a murderer and almost giving himself away by nervously farting. In the absence of actual jokes, the actors seem to have been directed to yell lines at each other, as if that will make them funny. Take Paracetamol, not popcorn.

2/15/2022,"They were separated by more than 200 years and catered to entirely different audiences. But French decorative artists of the 18th century and Walt Disney animators in America shared a unique ambition – to breathe life, character and charm into the inanimate. This spring an exhibition at the Wallace Collection – in collaboration with New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art – will explore Walt Disney’s personal fascination with France and French culture, and the way in which artists behind some of the most celebrated animation films of our time looked to French artworks for their source material.  Inspiring Walt Disney: The Animation of French Decorative Arts will display the hand-drawn animations alongside a selection of the finest 18th-century French furniture and porcelain to reveal the connections between the two artistic movements. The exhibition chronicles Disney’s visits to France and his personal discovery of French fairy tales, as well as his early attempts to bring inanimate objects to life. Early films from the Silly Symphony series (1929-1939) demonstrate his fascination with anthropomorphic objects such as porcelain vases and clocks. In total, more than 120 examples of production artwork and works on paper from the Walt Disney Animation Research Library and the Walt Disney Archives will be on display, alongside approximately 30 artworks from the French Rococo movement. These include Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s painting The Swing (circa 1767), which provided inspiration for several Disney films including Beauty and the Beast (1991), Tangled (2010) and Frozen (2013), and which will be showcased for the first time after its recent conservation. Particular attention is given to the imaginative architecture of Cinderella (1950) and Beauty and the Beast, which feature castles that took inspiration from Versailles and the Loire Valley in early development, and are decorated with gilded mirrors and motifs of the Rococo style. In Beauty and the Beast, the objects are imbued with a movement and emotion originally envisaged by French artists. Dr Helen Jacobsen, a co-curator of the exhibition, said: “This exhibition presents us with a remarkable opportunity both to appreciate the extraordinary talents behind Disney animated films and to understand the continuing relevance of French 18th-century artworks. “Juxtaposing one of the 20th century’s most iconic art forms with these exquisite objects not only provides an unprecedented look at the impact of French artworks on Disney Studios’ productions from the 1930s until the present, it also allows us to understand something of the wit and humour of the innovators of the Rococo, who turned everyday objects into works of genius.” Dr Xavier Bray, the director of the Wallace Collection, said the museum was “fortunate to have one of the finest collections of 18th-century artworks in the world and we are thrilled to be bringing it to life for new audiences, in a manner that the original geniuses of the French 18th century – Boulle, Meissonnier, Duplessis and Caffieri – envisaged 300 years ago.” Inspiring Walt Disney will run at the Wallace Museum from 6 April to 16 October 2022, after transferring from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.",Arts/Art and design,Fragonard to Frozen: how French art inspired Disney animators,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/15/fragonard-to-frozen-how-french-art-inspired-disney-animators
2/15/2022,"Welcome to Pushing Buttons, the Guardian’s gaming newsletter. If you’d like to receive it in your inbox every week, just pop your email in below – and check your inbox (and spam) for the confirmation email.  Welcome back to Pushing Buttons! In the spirit of carrying my perennial real-world lateness over into this newsletter, let’s talk about love, even though it is now 15 February and everyone will instantly forget about romance again until this time next year. As 500 different articles will already have reminded you this week, so much of the art that we humans make is about wanting someone you can’t have, having someone you don’t want, missing someone you once had, or sometimes even how much we like person/people we’re actually with. Not so with video games, though. Games are different. Very few of them are preoccupied with love. This would traditionally be the place for a cruel joke pointing out that that’s probably because nobody who makes or plays video games ever gets laid, but come on, it is 2022 and we have surely left these dumb stereotypes in the 90s. I do wonder why so few games really engage with this fundamental aspect of the human experience, though. I’ve played video games A lot in states of heartbreak or infatuation, but usually to get myself away from the overwhelming feelings I was experiencing at the time, not to examine them. The problem with video game love stories is that they often revolve around player choice. In a game, whether it’s a dating sim or Dragon Age or Harvest Moon, you generally choose whom you’re going to romance, and then it just … happens. In Mass Effect you might have to do a couple of missions to help your alien crush out first before they’ll jump into bed with you, and in Harvest Moon you have to give a potential spouse about 400 gifts before they’ll give you the time of day – but you can’t really fail at video game relationships. The fun is in picking your target. Even in The Sims, if you’ve got two little computer people with totally opposite personalities who can barely speak to each other, a really determined player can usually still marry them off, like some megalomaniacal matchmaker. Naturally, this is not how human relationships work. They are rarely so transactional. So much art has been made about love precisely because it is extremely unpredictable, and people so rarely get what they want out of it. In relationships according to video games, generally you get whatever you want. You’re hot bisexual Spartan Kassandra, wandering ancient Greece in Assassin’s Creed Odyssey and picking your conquests like low-hanging fruit. You’re Commander Shepard, having (on closer examination) wildly inappropriate relationships with several of your crew. When love stories actually work in games, it is because you have less influence over them. I’m thinking of Geralt and Yennefer in the Witcher series: they are independent people whose lives keep intersecting, and though plenty of Geralt’s potential romances in those games are embarrassingly pornographic, the ongoing story of his on-off relationship with Yenn feels much more real, partly because she keeps leaving him. Florence is a game about a love story that turns into a game about a breakup, where your futile attempts to fix things result in the puzzles becoming unsolvable. Games like Gone Home and Unpacking (I keep mentioning that game, don’t I?) tell love stories that you gradually uncover, leaving room for inference. I think one of the best love stories in games is actually Uncharted 4, a game about a big pirate treasure hunt that nonetheless makes room for not just the relationship between star Nathan Drake and his wife, Elena, but also the love between Nate and his brother, and also the love of adventure. It’s basically an extended action movie, but I nonetheless think it’s a story about how love can change us, and there still aren’t that many of those stories in games. I also couldn’t write about this topic without mentioning To The Moon, the only game that properly broke my heart. I won’t spoil that one, but if you’ve not played it … do. And I have to point you in the direction the only game that’s ever made me cry in public, anna anthropy’s Queers in Love at the End of the World. It’s an interactive fiction game that’s over in ten seconds, designed to be played over and over, inspired by its creator’s experience of the transformative power of queer love. It’s sad and blunt and sexy, and it still gives me shivers. If you’ve played a game about love that really hit you, hit reply on this and let me know. I’ll share them, along with some other reader recommendations, in a future issue. I have spent two weeks playing Horizon Forbidden West. This totally eccentric, massive, open-world sci-fi game about a flame-haired warrior and a bunch of robot dinosaurs, and despite the fact that it has weird controls, a meandering plot and so many different ideas going on that it’s impossible to keep track, I love it. I was suffering pretty badly from open-world fatigue for the past few years, but this was something I could really sink into – largely because it’s so gorgeous, with its sprawling continent of mountains and deserts and overgrown ruins and underwater caves, all teeming with interesting mechanised monsters to fight. I cannot believe games now look as good as this. My ten-year-old self would never believe it. Crucially, it also gives you new and interesting things to do beyond the first ten hours, so I never felt like I was just checking icons off the map. It says a lot that I’ve been cramming this game in order to review it, but still want more. If you’ve got space in your life right now for a massive game, this is an excellent choice – though with Elden Ring out later this month, it’ll soon have competition. Available on: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5Approximate playtime: 40 hours (with much more if you want it) Keeping with the theme, a new Sims story pack featuring a love story between two women will not be released in Russia, to avoid falling foul of the country’s homophobic laws on homosexual “propaganda”. Developers at EA Maxis stated that they didn’t want to censor it. But clearly, actually boycotting Russia in a show of solidarity with the series’ millions of queer fans is a step too far for the company. Nintendo is adding classic tracks to Mario Kart on Switch, and is also reimagining the beloved and bestselling Wii Sports, as Nintendo Switch Sports. News that warms my heart.

2/15/2022,"A Conservative MP who said eagles are not welcome in his constituency had his election campaign funded by a shooting estate, the Guardian can reveal. The West Dorset MP, Chris Loder, caused outrage when he seemed to imply police should not be prioritising the investigation of the recent death of an endangered white-tailed eagle, found dead on an estate in his constituency.  After police confirmed there was a multi-agency investigation into the death of the eagle, including a toxicology report, Loder said: “Dorset is not the place for eagles to be reintroduced. I’m not challenging government for more money for Dorset so it goes on this.” He added that officers should be focusing on crimes such as those involving county lines gangs instead. The eagle was one reintroduced on the Isle of Wight, where a successful programme has been taking place since summer 2019. The eagle went extinct in the UK in the early 20th century after they were continually poisoned and shot by gamekeepers. Loder’s 2019 election campaign benefited from a £14,000 donation from the Ilchester Estates, which runs shoots in his constituency. Those who run shoots are often opposed to birds of prey being in the area, as when they fly over a shoot, the birds scatter, disappointing those who paid to kill them. They also occasionally predate on game birds. The estates are run by Charlotte Townshend, an aristocrat worth almost £500m who has both farming and shooting interests. She also says she is the only person other than the Queen who is allowed to own swans. Neither Townshend nor a spokesperson for the Ilchester Estates could be reached for comment, and there is no suggestion the eagle died on their land, nor because of anyone associated with the estate. The police have not as of yet revealed where the eagle was found. Loder told the Guardian he did not feel he was influenced by the money from the estate, and his distaste for eagles in his constituency was because he had fears for their impact on farming. He said he had spent much time campaigning for animal welfare since being elected. Loder added: “My views on sea eagles come from me being a farmers’ son and my continued best efforts to represent the needs of West Dorset’s farming community. I am not convinced that sea eagles being here are in their best interests. No briefing or consultation has taken place with me or others that I know of by Natural England, campaigners, nor the RSPB to explain how these risks are managed, nor to inform the farming community that indeed these birds are in Dorset. “My policy views are formed in the best interests of the rural community I represent, which is also my home and where I was brought up. Any suggestion that I have been unduly influenced in this view is completely wrong.” The Guardian understands that the government is considering action to stop raptor persecution on shooting estates by tightening licences in problem areas. There were 137 cases of confirmed raptor persecution in 2020, according to the RSPB. Rebecca Pow, an environment minister, said: “There is always more we can do to tackle wildlife crime and we will carefully consider all of the UN’s recommendations – including those relating to raptor persecution – to help us build on the positive progress we have already made. Defra [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] sits on the police-led Raptor Persecution Priority Delivery Group, which takes forward activities to raise awareness and facilitate intelligence and incident reporting, leading to increased prevention and enforcement activity.” Luke Steele, the executive director of Wild Moors and a campaigner against raptor persecution, urged that this crackdown be implemented “without delay”, adding: “Birds of prey including eagles, hen harriers and red kites have a rightful place and an important ecological role in the British countryside. To persecute them to preserve game birds for sports shooting flies in the face of the 68% of the public who support reintroduction of birds of prey.”",News/Environment,MP who said eagles not welcome in constituency received funds from shooting estate ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/15/mp-eagles-not-welcome-constituency-received-funds-shooting-estate-chris-loder
