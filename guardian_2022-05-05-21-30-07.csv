5/5/2022,"The largest cave figures in North America have been discovered in Alabama as a result of advanced photography. In a study published on Tuesday in the journal Antiquity, researchers revealed that a cave in the northern Alabama countryside is home to carvings dating back about 1,000 years. Experts estimate that the carvings were made during the Woodland period. The carvings, some of which extend up to 7ft long, depict various figures, including what appears to be people wearing Native American garments such as headdresses and carrying a rattle or weapon. “They are either people dressed in regalia to look like spirits, or they are spirits,” archaeologist Jan Simek, a professor of anthropology at the University of Tennessee and lead author of the study, told NBC. Another carving features a curled up snake that experts largely believe is a diamond rattlesnake. The carvings slowly faded into the cave’s walls over the next century as they gradually got covered by naturally-occurring mud. Researchers, however, were able to discover the carvings after they used photographic photogrammetry to create photographic models of the cave’s ceiling. The technique combines digital photographs with 3D computerized models of a particular space. The cave, which was discovered in the 1990s, is part of thousands of caves alongside the southern part of the Appalachian Plateau, stretching from southern Pennsylvania to Alabama. The precise location of the cave has not been disclosed as researchers keep it a closely-guarded secret.",News/US news,"Largest US cave figures, about 1,000 years old, discovered in Alabama",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/05/largest-us-cave-figures-alabama-carvings
5/5/2022,"On most Sunday mornings, the searing voice of Osinachi Nwachukwu, one of Nigeria’s best-known gospel singers, filled the vast 100,000 seater auditorium of her church in Abuja. Footage from one of the last times she led the choir at the Dunamis International Gospel Centre showed her singing the 2017 gospel hit Ekwueme, her eyes pressed closed and hand outstretched in prayer. On 8 April, the 42-year-old died at a hospital in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital. Her husband and manager Peter Nwachukwu, a pastor, said she had been suffering from an undisclosed illness, but in the days that followed family members and friends alleged that she had died from injuries sustained from domestic abuse. Her four children told Nigerian authorities that Nwachukwu had suffered constant violence at the hands of their father, who they said had sworn them to secrecy. People who knew the couple cast Peter Nwachukwu as a dominating figure, controlling her finances and decisions. On 11 April, police arrested Peter Nwachukwu and said they were waiting for autopsy results to help determine the cause of death. He has denied all allegations of abuse, telling police he was not responsible for his wife’s death. The allegations around Nwachukwu’s death sent shock ripples through Nigeria’s Christian communities and wider society, raising questions about gender-violence and the extent to which religious teachings and societal values condemn divorce, no matter the circumstances. “There are counsels and narratives which church leaders need to reassess,” Sandra Ijeoma Okoye wrote in an opinion column for the Nigerian Voice last month. “Counsels and narratives which sound logical and sensible on the surface give cover to spousal abuse and the objectification of women as property.” In media interviews and social media posts, relatives and friends have said they pleaded with Nwachukwu to leave her husband, but she resisted, believing it to be a sin and insisting that he would change. “She felt that God is against divorce,” her sister Favour Made, told local media last month. “We told her that separation is not a sin but just for her to stay alive.” According to her family, Nwachukwu was receiving medical treatment for several weeks before her death. They allege that on one occasion doctors found clusters of blood around her chest that were a result of being struck. People who knew Nwachukwu in Nigeria’s gospel music scene described her as tender and unassuming – a rare trait in the industry. Sunny Pee, a producer who had worked with Nwachukwu since 2017, said she was a “beautiful soul”. On learning of her death he said: “I had to go to my room. Shut my door. My wife was there. And I cried, I wept like a baby.” Pee accused Peter Nwachukwu of being an aggressive and violent figure. “The last time I spoke to Mr Nwachukwu was in March last year and I told him: ‘One day you’re going to kill this woman. You’re going to kill her if you keep going on like this,” Pee said. People who knew the church’s leadership said senior figures had been warned not to talk to the media, amid increased attention on the church’s teaching on divorce and what if anything figures from the church knew about the alleged abuse. In a Twitter post from three years ago, Paul Enenche, the church’s founder, spoke out against domestic abuse, writing: “It is better to be alive without a marriage than to be killed before your time because you are married.” Another post from the same year reflected the church’s teachings on marriage. “Submission is not slavery but service,” Enenche wrote. “Stop talking back at your husband; rather, talk for your husband.” A post from his wife Becky Paul-Enenche, also from 2019, said: “Never make divorce an option at all. The stress you put your children through may affect them for the rest of their lives.” In a broadcast last month, Enenche denied he was aware of any alleged abuse suffered by Nwachukwu until after her death. On the first Sunday in May, hordes of worshippers streamed into the Dunamis International Gospel Centre. “I’m ashamed, it feels like they are trying to sweep this [Nwachukwu’s death] under the carpet, said a worshipper called Honest, who has been attending Dunamis for three years. Ikaraoha Chinwe, another member of Dunamis, said she would miss hearing Nwachukwu’s voice in church. “Whatever she was going through, you wouldn’t perceive it on her face,” she said. “When she sang it was like the holy spirit came down.” Ehizogie Ohiano contributed reporting",News/World news,Nigerian gospel singer’s death puts divorce beliefs in spotlight,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/nigerian-gospel-singers-death-puts-divorce-beliefs-in-spotlight-osinachi-nwachukwu
5/5/2022,"This tender tribute to dancing/mime/commedia dell’arte masters Barry and Joan Grantham is as sweet and nostalgic as elderflower cordial. Married for donkey’s years, the couple are somewhere in their 80s or 90s. This film is airily unspecific about such details, although every clip showing one of their film appearances is accompanied by a date, some going back to the 1940s. Manchester-reared Barry started out as a “ballet boy”, trained with famed dancer Stanislas Idzikowski whom he still refers to as his “beloved master”, and even appeared in Powell and Pressburger’s The Red Shoes in 1948. Joan, from the more genteel home counties, was a second or third generation musician and came up through the business as a dancer as well, but also tickled the ivories; now she mostly plays accompaniment on the piano in the couple’s studio as they train various adult pupils in the mysteries of commedia, diction and performance in general. The students interviewed here clearly adore them, and talk with endearing, gushy enthusiasm about the experience of learning from them. Director Audrey Rumsby, one of the Granthams’ students herself, clearly shares that affection but smartly upholsters her film with a rich seam of archive footage and original animation that goes well beyond the title couple themselves. As a result, the movie provides a brisk, efficient primer on commedia dell’arte, from its roots in Italy and on through Molière and Shakespeare, on to vaudeville and Max Miller, and right up to James Corden and One Man, Two Guvnors. Friends of the Granthams offer extra insight about the use of masks and acting skills. The whole package works a treat for theatre geeks, mime fans and lovers of “eccentric dance.”  Barry & Joan is released on 6 May in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Barry & Joan review – eccentric vaudevillians get joyful celebration,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/03/barry-joan-review-joyful-celebration-of-eccentric-entertainers
5/5/2022,"Within three weeks of the invasion, Russian forces had hit dozens of historic buildings in Kharkiv, an eastern Ukrainian city recognised at home and abroad for its rich mix of architectural heritage, including grand formal buildings and Soviet modernist structures. Strikes on the city, many of which were carried out by Russian military planes, sent shock waves through Ukraine and prompted hundreds of thousands of terrified Kharkivians to flee. In early March the city’s train station – another architectural treasure – was packed with people trying to board trains going west. Some of those who remained have attempted to catalogue the destruction, compiling a list of as many as 68 buildings of architectural significance, of which Unesco has confirmed 27 have been damaged or destroyed. The Guardian visited more than a dozen on the list. The destruction of historic buildings is considered a war crime by the international criminal court. Though Kharkiv has been one of the worst-affected cities, the Ukrainian culture ministry stated on 23 April that it had recorded 240 crimes against the country’s cultural heritage. In late March, local authorities across Ukraine sandbagged monuments to protect them in the event of an attack. Kharkiv’s architecture reflects the city’s regional significance over centuries. There are traditional cottages, art nouveau, neo-classical and Renaissance-style grand buildings, and 19th-century two-storey brick houses from when the city was a home for Cossacks and then a hub of the Tsarist Russian empire’s industrialisation. From the 20th century its Soviet boulevards, cooperative apartment buildings, and the experimental district for workers of the Kharkiv tractor factory – built when Kharkiv was the Soviet capital of Ukraine – are internationally recognised. Russian forces continue to frequently bomb and kill civilians in the city, located less than 20 miles from the Russian border, but the plane attacks have ceased. The northern and eastern parts of the city remain the worst affected, while the city centre is now relatively free from the shelling. Some of Kharkiv’s inhabitants supported an attempt by Russian proxies to take control of the city in 2014 when the war in eastern Ukraine began, but the numbers of Russian loyalists were not sufficient to change the city’s political course. One of the witnesses to a missile attack on the Kharkiv regional administration, in the city centre, exclaimed in a video he filmed: “For those of you who were waiting for ‘Russian world’ to come here, this what you wanted, yeah? Well, we warned you.” The building was a grand Soviet edifice from 1954. Russian missiles also destroyed the Stalinist-era regional headquarters of the Ukrainian intelligence services and the neo-classical Kharkiv court of appeal. Almost an entire length of Myronosytska Street in the city centre was taken out by the strikes. Pictures of the aftermath are reminiscent of the blitz in London. Aside from the state bodies, gems of architectural significance that posed no political or military significance were hit. Local architects say they believe this was because Russian forces want to carry out a terror campaign to scare the population into fleeing or giving in. In the east of the city, the tractor factory district – a series of 1929 apartment buildings and accompanying facilities to house the workers of the largest tractor factory in Ukraine – was hit by artillery shells several times and a cluster bomb that killed at least 10 people and injured 42 three weeks ago. Kateryna Kublytska, a Kharkiv architect and restorationist who lives in one of the old workers’ apartment blocks, said that when the district was built it closely followed Soviet socialist ideas. For example, the workers’ apartments did not have kitchens, in the hope of removing the pressure on women to provide meals, so the whole community ate in communal canteens. Similarly, residents had access to nursery facilities that would take babies at several weeks old. The nursery buildings had ramps instead of staircases to make it easier to push prams up and down the floors. But the socialist ideals only went so far. The factory managers lived in a bigger apartment block with their own kitchens, and the apartments came with a room for their officially employed housekeeper. There were plans to connect all the apartment buildings with suspended tunnels so that residents could drop their children at nursery or the purpose-built school and eat their meals without having to put on their coats and boots during Ukraine’s long, snowy winters. Sundecks were proposed for the tops of the buildings so that residents could increase their intake of vitamin D. But when the Soviet capital moved to Kyiv in 1934, Kublytska said, the plans were forgotten. Kublytska said the damage to Kharkiv had hurt her deeply. The British architect Norman Foster recently announced he had drafted a manifesto to rebuild the city, but Kublytska said this had riled many Kharkiv architects. The head of the Kharkiv School of Architecture referred to the plans as “intellectual colonisation”. She said they were happy to invite architects and specialists from all over the world but work should be led by people who knew the city and involve extensive discussions with residents. “Right now we live in a new reality – one that we are only starting to grasp,” Kublytska said. “We live right next to the border and could be bombed for several years to come. We need to understand how many people will come back and what they will need when they do.” Kublytska and her circle of Kharkiv architects are nevertheless starting to lay down the foundations for what they hope will be a new era for the city’s buildings. She said people were starting to value buildings because they now knew what it was like to lose them. “When everything was left to fall by the wayside in the 1990s, people had this strong desire to build brand new things, which often didn’t have much thought behind them,” said Kublytska, adding that older buildings around the city had been neglected or part-renovated without thought to their original character. Kublytska pointed to the tarmac around the tractor factory apartments covering the original cobblestone roads and redbrick paths that weaved between the greenery and parks. “What we want – me and my milieu – is to get Kharkivians to value what we already have. To value authenticity and restore our cultural code. This is our collective history.”",News/World news,Kharkiv catalogues war’s toll on its architectural gems,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/kharkiv-catalogues-war-toll-on-architectural-gems-historic-buildings-ukraine
5/5/2022,"The Foreign Office minister Amanda Milling has said a decision on whether to impose direct rule on the British Virgin Islands (BVI) has still be to be made following her return from a three-day visit to the overseas territory, but said its government must address endemic corruption. Her emergency trip, during which she met a variety of business, community and political leaders, came after the territory’s premier, Andrew Fahie, appeared in a US federal court in Miami last week on charges of money-laundering and conspiring to import cocaine following his arrest in a sting operation by agents posing as Mexican drug traffickers. The BVI government has rejected direct rule, proposed an alternative of an interim national unity government including members from all parties, and committed to addressing the systematic maladministration revealed in a commission of inquiry report ordered by the territory’s governor, the publication of which coincided with Fahie’s arrest by the US Drug Enforcement Administration. Milling will have to decide whether the imposition of direct rule, which is also opposed by leaders of other Caribbean islands, will hinder the process of reforming government, or whether the problems are so deep-seated that it requires the BVI governor, John Rankin, to take sole charge, aided by an advisory council. At present, the governor is in charge of foreign, defence and security policies, while elected politicians working in the national assembly are accountable for budgets and domestic policy. The retired judge Sir Gary Hickinbottom, who conducted the lengthy inquiry, had concluded “with a heavy heart” in his chief recommendation that direct rule was required because the misgovernment was deliberate and stretched back over more than one political administration. In a statement as she left the territory, Milling said: “Let’s be clear – the report highlighted significant concerns around corruption, transparency and accountability. There is no getting away from this. Like many people have told me, this isn’t a question of whether something should be done. It is a question of what is done. Action is needed now to strengthen the foundations of the territory; deliver a better public service; maintain a strong and resilient economy; and create better opportunities for the people of the BVI.” Milling said she had heard from community and religious leaders of the impact of corruption on daily lives, adding that “significant changes” were required. “There is an urgent need to fix the systems, processes, laws and norms to ensure that money spent by the government … is better spent on roads, education, hospitals and better public services and not misused as the COI has found,” she said. The acting premier, Natalio Wheatley, has proposed a national unity government consisting of members of the National Democratic party as well as the Progressive Virgin Islands Movement. Two members of the existing government would not be offered ministerial posts, and the new government would remain in place for 10 to 12 months.

5/5/2022,"Pope Francis was seen using a wheelchair in public for the first time on Thursday following, days after he said he was having treatment for knee pain. The pontiff, who has been suffering from pain in his right knee for some time, was wheeled into the Paul VI hall in Vatican city for a meeting with nuns and mother superiors from around the world. In an interview with Corriere della Sera on Tuesday, Francis, 85, said he was about to undergo a minor “intervention with infiltration” due to a strained ligament. At the end of an audience with bishops from Slovakia last week, the pope, seated in a chair, apologised for not being able to rise to his feet to greet his guests. “There is a problem, this knee doesn’t work,” he said. “I have to obey the doctor, who told me not to walk.” The newspaper, Il Messaggero, said the nuns gave the pope a long applause as he was wheeled into the room by his most trusted assistant. Although he has used a wheelchair before, this was the first time he has appeared in one in public. The pontiff also told Corriere that he was “ready to travel to Moscow” after requesting a meeting with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, over the war in Ukraine, but had not yet had a response. Francis was scolded by Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox church, after urging him not to become the Kremlin’s “altar boy” in the interview. Kirill, a close ally of Putin who backs the war in Ukraine, accused the pope of choosing an “incorrect tone” to convey his message and that such remarks would damage dialogue between the two churches. Meanwhile, Madonna has requested a meeting with the pope. On her Twitter account, the singer wrote: “I’m a good Catholic. I swear! I mean I don’t Swear!

5/5/2022,"The co-founder of Arm has said the UK government is only just waking up to the fact that London is struggling to attract leading tech company listings, adding that New York was the obvious choice for the British-based chip designer’s primary stock market flotation. Hermann Hauser said it was an issue of a lack of liquidity in London and poor support and infrastructure for local firms. “The problem with London is it’s really too small for a company of the size of Arm to do it alone,” Hauser said. “There isn’t the liquidity for technology stocks in London, London doesn’t have the analyst cover of technology companies that New York has, and sadly, it doesn’t have the same cachet for technology companies as New York,” Hauser told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Hauser said a dual structure could solve the issue of London’s lack of liquidity and analyst expertise. “A co-listing with New York would be the natural solution.” “Arm is a UK company. It worked well with a dual listing before and I’m very much in favour of having a dual listed in London again,” he said. Analysts have estimated that Arm could be worth up to $40bn (£32.1bn) when it goes public. A New York listing would be a blow to the prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who last year tried to make London more attractive to tech firms by controversially giving founders more control through dual class share structures and slashing the number of shares required to be offered to the public to just 10%. It emerged earlier this week that the prime minister joined the lobbying efforts – already under way by London Stock Exchange executives and a number of government departments and senior officials – to try to convince Arm to float its shares in London. It culminated in Johnson writing a letter to bosses at Arm’s Japanese parent company, SoftBank, as part of his last-ditch charm offensive. After the collapse of the $66bn sale of the Cambridge-based business to US-based Nvidia earlier this year, Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of Softbank, snubbed the UK for a flotation. “We think that the Nasdaq stock exchange in the US, which is at the centre of global hi-tech, would be most suitable,” he said in February. Hauser said parliament was late to realise the importance of fostering burgeoning tech firms. “Tech sovereignty has become one of those key issues of the decade and even technologically illiterate politicians like Johnson and the majority of parliament sadly have woken up to the fact that it is important to support the local technology companies with local stock exchanges,” Hauser said. “So it’s a little late of a wake up call but better late than never.”",News/Business,"UK ‘waking up’ to poor tech-listing appeal in London, says Arm co-founder",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/05/arm-chip-designer-uk-tech-listing-london
5/5/2022,"‘What’s wrong?” says a husband to his wife when he finds her rustling up hot milk in the small hours of the morning. “I’m not sure I love you any more,” she replies and her words leave the ground shaking beneath this couple’s feet. It is an arresting opening to a marital reckoning which is a confrontation with midlife itself: its yearnings, disappointments and wrong turns unravelled in this capacious Essex kitchen-cum-living room, as Maggie (Claire Rushbrook) and Gary (Daniel Ryan) wrestle out their differences. The second in David Eldridge’s trilogy exploring love and relationships, which began with Beginning, it similarly unfolds over an uninterrupted 100 minutes of conversation. But Maggie and Gary are not the couple of the first play. They are a decade older, on the brink of 50, with a young daughter and more than 12 years of married hinterland behind them. Directed by Polly Findlay (who also staged Beginning), Rushbrook and Ryan draw our sympathies both ways. We withhold final judgment on the rights and wrongs of their marriage largely due to their very human and likable performances, even if they do feel too much like a generic middle-aged couple, entangled in the web of a burdensome mortgage, the juggle of childcare, overwork, boredom, loneliness, peri-menopause and stale sex. Where Beginning captured the prospect of a shared future fizzing ahead, this play focuses on the backward glancing and inner audit of the middle years: is this what I wanted? Has marriage made me happy? If the first play was taut with expectation, this one is saggy with familiarity and knowing, both in form and content. The same old gripes rise up between the pair repeatedly, giving the drama a circularity: his regret at not having more children, her resentment at his overindulgent fathering and having been left alone with the baby. There is a third party involved too – again a little predictably – which brings with it a chance to have a second go at life. Gentle comedy leavens out the resentments and brings some good lines. When she suggests they move into separate rooms, he quips: “I don’t think they have conscious uncoupling in Essex. Unconscious coupling, yes …” But it takes away a certain edge and creates a foundational warmth between them so we do not fully buy into Maggie’s discontent. They seem like a sad, lost couple but without a deeply felt bitterness, cynicism or gut-wrenching anger. Then again, uncertainty is built into the plot line and this is perhaps a couple not yet past the point of no return. Eldridge is incredibly good at dramatising a culturally specific world – an Essex couple from working-class backgrounds and with upwardly mobile ambitions – that we do not often see in anything other than satirical or comic mode. The class tensions between them are expertly drawn out: how Maggie’s family looks at Gary’s and how that stains the couple’s view of each other to some degree. It feels like a true and tender representation of a marriage in its middle stages, a drama that is tepid at times, a little plodding and soft around the edges but forging on – much like middle age itself.

5/5/2022,"Dallas Mavericks coach Jason Kidd says his star player Luka Doncic cannot continue to carry the team on his own as they went down to another defeat to the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference semifinals. The Slovenian All-Star scored 35 points on Wednesday night but was responsible for most of the Mavs’ offense as the Suns completed a 129-109 victory to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series. Doncic scored more points on Wednesday than Dallas guards Jalen Brunson and Spencer Dinwiddie have managed in the last two games combined. “He had a great game, but no one else showed,” Kidd said. “We’ve got to get other guys shooting the ball better. We can’t win with just him out there scoring 30 a night – not at this time of the year. And we’re playing the best team in the league, so we’ve got to get other guys going.” However Doncic was far from perfect himself and the Suns targeted him when they were on offense in the second-half, when they scored 71 points. “Tough matchup to guard,” Booker said of Doncic, “but he’s going to have to guard a bit.” Doncic himself agreed. “I’ve just got to play better defense,” he said. “That’s it.” Chris Paul in particular went after the 23-year-old Doncic, particularly during a 21-7 run for the Suns at the start of the fourth quarter that effectively settled the game. “We need to do a better job of helping him [on defence],” Kidd said. “They’re bringing him up into everything. We knew that coming into the series. We knew that in the last series. We did a better job of protecting one another, not just Luka. We’ve got to get back to protecting one another for Game 3 back at home.” Doncic’s frustration showed in his interaction with the Suns fans in Phoenix. He regularly gestured and directed words at them after making baskets. During the third quarter he had to be held back by security after taking exception to something someone in the crowd said to him.

So I could tell you what I had, but I’d be fantasising my perfect meal. Whatever it was, it was bloody gorgeous. Chris He’s happier with the current Labour party than I am, and I think probably more critical of Corbyn, but he did say he didn’t think Corbyn was this commie antisemite tyrant. Which is always a nice place to start. Jake The Labour party moves around, and I stay relatively down the middle. Sometimes they’re to the left of me and sometimes to the right. We were both more interested in the issues than the party. Chris We talked about whether or not boomers should pay more tax. He was more on board with that general statement. I was a bit more reserved. For me, it’s not an age issue, it’s a social class issue and a wealth issue. I hate the term “boomer”, anyway. It’s fair to say they may have had a better run of it in certain social and economic frameworks: education; the housing market; less wage disparity. But there are still people within that who live in poverty and struggle. Jake In terms of paying for housing, if anything I came across as maybe a little more leftwing than him. I feel strongly that one of the things Labour needs to do more of, and hasn’t done in the past few years, is be a lot more radical in terms of inheritance tax. Baby boomers have done incredibly well in terms of property prices. Chris My argument against that would be that people of the boomer generation who have a little bit of money, their kids might not have a lot of money and are trapped by the economic cycle. I’m in favour of heavier inheritance tax for millionaires and billionaires, but not for people leaving £5,000 or £6,000, which could be really helpful. Jake There’s an awful lot of luck involved with inheritance. You don’t choose your parents. I’m probably in favour of 100% inheritance tax. I know the right wing of the party wouldn’t like it, because it hasn’t been through the Daily Mail test, but I’m of the view that we should stop being so timid. Chris I’m totally in favour of legalising all drugs. I don’t think there’s any such thing as bad drugs, just bad application. Jake I had a view a while ago that drugs should be very heavily policed. I’ve become more liberal over the years. My rationale is if people are buying drugs illegally, they don’t know what’s in them. I do think there’s an advantage to having them decriminalised, so you can break the links between the consumer and the criminal network. Chris We talked about Covid. I’ve got a little bit of a libertarian streak in me. There should definitely be a mask mandate, people should be vaccinated. I’m so far from an anti-vax idiot, but the idea of a government programme of forcing everyone to get a vaccine, otherwise you’re excluded from public life, seems a little bit distorted to me. Jake Perhaps, unsurprisingly, given who I work for, I feel quite strongly about making sure everything is following the data. You really do need to be led by experts, rather than going with some libertarian fetish. I guess it’s shaped by my experience – I had quite a serious health issue that involved me being in hospital for three weeks in 2020. There’s nothing like being in hospital as a patient when there’s a pandemic on to make you appreciate how serious it is. Chris Whatever niggles it sounds like we had, he was a stand-up bloke.

5/5/2022,"Channel 4 has said it could sell its £100m London headquarters and almost double the number of staff working outside the capital, to become “northern-based” under a plan it hopes offers an attractive alternative to the government’s privatisation push. Describing itself in the proposals as the “levelling up broadcaster”, it said it intended to increase spending on TV shows commissioned by production companies outside of London by hundreds of millions of pounds annually by 2030, in a move it estimated would create at least 3,000 jobs. The broadcaster, which is state-owned but commercially funded, said the changes would mean the majority of its 800 staff would be based in locations including its “national headquarters” in Leeds, and hubs such as Glasgow, Bristol, Manchester and Birmingham, with the number of staff working outside London nearly doubling to 600 by 2025. “Alongside this, we would streamline our presence in London by creating a new London base that reflects our new ways of working,” the broadcaster said in its plan, called 4: The Next Episode, which had been rejected by the government. “As we embrace hybrid working, and reorient our focus away from London to the nations and regions – a reorientation intrinsic to our existence in public ownership – Channel 4 may require a different scale London base.” The government eyed the £100m windfall of a potential sale of Channel 4’s headquarters in Victoria, central London, the last time it attempted to privatise the broadcaster but ultimately backed down. Channel 4’s plan also includes the creation of a joint venture, with an external investor as a majority shareholder, to spend £200m annually on new content and ultimately boost its total programming budget from £700m to £1bn a year by 2030. Other plans include launching its All4 streaming service globally, targeting younger demographics, which it believes could make a further £100m annually. Last week, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) started the formal process to privatise Channel 4 in a wide-ranging white paper shaking up the British media industry, despite widespread opposition across the sector and from Labour and Conservative MPs, arguing it needs to be in private hands to be able to compete financially with global streaming giants such as Netflix. The government’s consultation received 56,000 responses, with 96% against privatisation. “Channel 4 is in the most robust health it has ever been,” said Alex Mahon, the broadcaster’s chief executive. “This is an attractive, realistic and sustainable solution while remaining in the hands of the British public. “There is plenty of evidence [that privatisation] is not what the public want and not what industry want. I’m sure the DCMS do not want to damage the creative industries. But this white paper as it is currently laid out, we need to be very careful we do not create unintended negative consequences for the industry. There are plenty of stages to go in the ownership discussion.” Channel 4 research estimates that government plans to scrap its unique publisher/broadcaster model, in which programme rights revert to makers allowing them to commercially exploit them after they air, could cost 4,000 jobs and hundreds of millions annually for production companies. It has been speculated in city circles that Mahon – who has extensive private sector experience including spending almost a decade running Elisabeth Murdoch’s Shine, maker of shows including MasterChef, which was sold to her father Rupert’s News Corporation in 2011 – may become involved in a form of management buyout of the broadcaster. However, on Thursday Mahon ruled herself out of any potential involvement, stating that the future of Channel 4 would lie with the government and UK Government Investments (UKGI), which oversees the state’s ownership of the broadcaster. “I’ve got to be very clear on delivering the best thing for Channel 4,” she said. “And for that I have got to run the business, be independent of such things, optimise the remit, do that for the next few years. What does or doesn’t get decided through a sales process will not be up to me. That will be up to UKGI and how the government do this. Therefore I am remaining completely independent of that.” ",News/Media,Channel 4 offers to sell London HQ under alternative plan to privatisation,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/05/channel-4-considers-selling-london-hq-north-privatisation
5/5/2022,"A police and crime commissioner (PCC) has become the first to call her area’s force “institutionally racist”, a statement quickly followed by a categorical rebuttal from the chief constable. In a roundtable discussion between three elected PCCs on Policing TV’s Talking Crime programme, Emily Spurrell, the Merseyside commissioner, was asked if she accepted that Merseyside police were institutionally racist. “I do, I do,” she replied, “and I’ve had this conversation with my chief because I think when you look at the definition of institutional racism, it is not about individual officers. “I know that Merseyside police has got some absolutely … the vast majority are incredibly dedicated, not racist. They are absolutely committed to serving the public whoever they are.” Spurrell said the definition of institutional racism was not one which involved calling individual officers racist. She said it was about saying the institution, like many across the country, had been designed by a certain group of people “and it does not take into account how black and ethnic minority people might experience things and how they might get treated and the systems you design, the tools that you use, the policies you’ve put in place”. She said the sooner police forces accepted the term “we can move on to putting it right. But it isn’t about calling individual officers racist.” Asked whether the chief constable of Merseyside police, Serena Kennedy, agreed with her, Spurrell said: “No, she doesn’t.” That became abundantly clear when Kennedy, late on Wednesday evening, released a statement in which she said: “I categorically do not believe that Merseyside police is institutionally racist.” She continued: “The history and impact of racism across policing and the harm this has caused to communities and colleagues is clear. There has been a lot of work done nationally and locally to understand and address this. “We know that policing, like society, is not free of racial discrimination, bias and disproportionality. It still exists in some policies and processes, and we are taking action to change this. “We collectively want to improve, we want to progress, we want to be better. We are not institutionally racist.” Kennedy said she saw every day how committed her officers and staff were to helping communities and playing an “active part in ensuring we are anti-racist”. Spurrell’s comments also brought a rebuke from the Merseyside police federation. A spokesperson said the allegation the force was institutionally racist was “deeply disappointing” and added: “We refute this statement.” The Guardian revealed in December that Britain’s most senior police officers were considering making a public admission that their forces are institutionally racist. The National Police Chiefs Council appointed the barrister Abimbola Johnson to chair an independent board scrutinising reforms. She said any plan to make policing anti-racist needed to accept institutional racism. “If the idea is to win the trust of black communities, policing needs to start by acknowledging both the historical and current manifestations of racism in policing,” she said. Police chiefs were said to be split on the question and by February it emerged that it had been decided not to accept that forces were institutionally racist. In the Policing TV debate David Lloyd, the PCC for Hertfordshire, said: “I think it is really unhelpful to talk about a police force being institutionally racist.” It was beyond the power of individual police forces to take a decision on whether they were, he said. “I’m rather concerned that they feel it is for them to make that decision but they have painted themselves a little bit into a corner around it, I’m afraid.” Policing was first officially labelled as institutionally racist in the 1999 Macpherson report on failings that allowed the racist killers of the black student Stephen Lawrence to escape justice for so long.",News/UK news,Merseyside police commissioner sparks row with force over ‘institutional racism’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/05/merseyside-police-commissioner-says-force-is-institutionally-racist
5/5/2022,"Anthony Vanden Borre isn’t a player many remember. He played 28 times for Belgium. He played for some decent European sides: Fiorentina, Genoa, Anderlecht, Montpellier. You might not recall his 19 appearances for Avram Grant’s Portsmouth in the Premier League 13 years ago. And you would be forgiven for not instantly recollecting the moment in the 60th minute of a goalless draw with Blackburn on 3 April 2010 where he was given a second yellow card for a deliberate handball by Steve Bennett. Morton Gamst Pedersen knocks it down the line for Martin Olsson and Vanden Borre sticks out an arm – it rules him out of an FA Cup semi-final at Wembley. In your defence there’s been a lot of football, and a lot of life, since then. The thing is though, you all know this moment. “We’re off to Fratton Park where there’s been a red card, but for who Chris Kamara?” “I don’t know Jeff, has there? I must have missed that.” Cue off screen laughs from Paul Merson and the rest of the Sky Sports Soccer Saturday studio. “Chris, have you not been watching? I haven’t,” asks an already grinning Jeff Stelling. “I don’t know where that’s come from Chris. I’ve no idea what has happened there. What has happened Chris?” “I don’t know Jeff!” Kammy replies, bending double in hysterics. It is quite simply a brilliant bit of television. The best bits are always when it doesn’t go to plan. Stelling advises Kammy to count the players. By now Kammy is full falsetto. “No you’re right, I saw him go off, but I thought they were bringing a sub on Jeff.” The highlights of the match have under 600 views on YouTube. The Soccer Saturday clip has millions. It’s so good not just because of the timing – obviously Stelling is a master – but of the wonderful pure honesty. So many reporters would have tried to bluff, or come up with an excuse. There is a strange desperation to always be right and never make a mistake, and certainly never to admit making one. But Kammy owns it with a warmth and charm that have been a constant throughout his 24 years at Sky. Kamara announced this week that he’s leaving Sky Sports. The key to his enduring popularity is something so simple. He’s always enjoying himself. It is salutary lesson for those us who work in the industry. No need for your tiny violins – and I appreciate after the last two nights this isn’t the week to complain – but it can be draining. Football never ends. #Wegoagain – too right we do. Weird alarm times, relentless travel, thinking of another superlative for Liverpool. Do I have to watch the Championship tonight? And that’s before you consider all the depressing issues in the game that you have a duty to read up on, report and discuss. Kammy made the most of every minute. And in a sport where so many people take themselves too seriously, or deliver over hyped hyperbolic opinions every five minutes, he was a gentle interviewer and had a great ability to laugh at himself. And he had almost no inhibitions. On the “Kammy-do-it?” feature on Soccer AM he did everything: a full stand up set, emerging from the tube on Take Me Out to a very bemused set of prospective suitors, and, if memory serves me correctly, an actual rodeo where he fell off a horse. One afternoon the two of us got stuck at the top of a scramble net in the middle of a forest on some ludicrous assault course. There are a couple of things worth remembering about that red card clip. Firstly, I’m sure Kammy would acknowledge that if he was the Eric Morecambe of the Soccer Saturday crew, he relied on scores of Ernie Wises up and down the country – your Gwynns, your Boultings, your Carruthers, your Michelle Owens – delivering slick, punchy updates from every division. That’s why it worked - the light relief amongst the important information. The “unbelievable Jeff”. It’s hard in a footballing context or indeed any context to say unbelievable without an involuntary Jeff just blurting out of you before you’ve had time to think. Kammy did that. But secondly you can’t last that long without really studying and knowing the game. He would get in for work almost in the middle of the night ahead of Goals On Sunday to find things that Match Of the Day hadn’t noticed. He somehow found a balance between serious football and being downright silly. Not many can bridge that gap – nor can they branch out into Saturday night light entertainment. That is a completely different world. Viewers noticed him struggling with his language at Rotherham the other week. He explained that he has been diagnosed with apraxia, a neurological disorder which can affect your speech. “When it’s bad it stops the signals going from my brain to my mouth,” he told Good Morning Britain. “It slurs the words. People are thinking is he OK? Is he drunk? What’s the matter with him? I’m trying to use parts of my brain – I have got one! – to try and speak fluently.” Despite that the good news is he’ll continue to host Ninja Warrior and no doubt pursue other projects. I wish him so much luck and happiness. It’s always worth reminding yourself what a privilege it is to get paid to watch football and be given airtime or column space to say what you think about it. Kammy did almost a quarter of a century – way longer than he played. That’s a generation of football fans watching and enjoying his work. That first Saturday next season will be weird for him. But the cliches are true – life moves fast, the game moves on. Someone else will be at Fratton Park next season. They’ll probably notice the red cards. And because of that, most of us won’t even realise they’ve happened.",Sport/Football,"The secret of Kammy’s success?
