3/13/2022,"COMRAT, Moldova (AP) — Across the border from war-engulfed Ukraine, tiny, impoverished Moldova — an ex-Soviet republic now looking eagerly Westward — has watched with trepidation as the Russian invasion unfolds. In Gagauzia, a small, autonomous part of the country that's traditionally felt closer to the Kremlin than the West, people would normally back Russia, which they never wanted to leave when Moldova gained independence. But this time, most have trouble identifying with either side in the war. Anna Koejoglo says she's deeply conflicted. “I have sisters (in Ukraine), I have nephews there, my own son is in Kyiv,” the 52-year-old said, quickly adding that her other, younger, son is studying in Russia. “My heart is (broken), my insides are burning,” she told The Associated Press. Koejoglo is one of Moldova’s 160,000 Gagauz, an Orthodox Christian people of Turkic origin who were settled there by the Russian Empire in the 19th century. They make up over 80% of Gagauzia's population, but only 5% of Moldova’s 2.6 million people. In the early 1990s, when landlocked Moldova voted to leave the Soviet Union, its Gagauz and Russian minorities wanted to stay. But unlike Russian-backed separatists in eastern Moldova who took up arms in 1992 to establish the unrecognized, breakaway Trans-Dniester area — which Russia essentially controls, maintaining some 1,500 troops there — the Gagauz in the south chose to compromise. In 1994, they reached an agreement with the government in Moldova’s capital, Chisinau, settling for a high degree of autonomy. Still, Gagauzia has maintained a strong relationship with Russia, where many Gagauz find education and job opportunities. Its population generally opposes the pro-Western shift embraced by ethnic Moldovans who account for 75% of the country’s people. For Peotr Sarangi, a 25-year-old Gagauz, the old ties still hold strong. “(The) Gagauzian population supports Russia more, many remain pro-Russian,” he said. Although Moldova is neutral militarily and has no plans to join NATO, it formally applied for EU membership when the Russian invasion began. It's also taken in about a tenth of the more than 2.3 million Ukrainians who fled their country for safety. Ilona Manolo, a 20-year-old Gagauz, has no qualms in laying the blame with Moscow. “I think that Russia is at fault. ... I’d rather support (Ukrainian) refugees,” than Russia, she said. There's similar sentiment elsewhere among Moldova's rich patchwork of ethnic minorities — even expressed by ethnic Russians who live outside the separatist region of Trans-Dniester. One of the latter group, Nikola Sidorov, described the invasion of Ukraine as a “terrible thing."" He said he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin “went too far (and) needs to calm down.” The 79-year-old added that the issue has become a subject of heated debates among his ethnic kin in Moldova’s second largest city, Balti, where ethnic Russians make up some 15% of the population. An ethnic Ukrainian who lives in Balti said her sympathies were divided. “I’m very sorry for the people of Ukraine ... but I also feel sorry for Russians,” said Iulia Popovic, 66. “I understand that it is all (happening because of) politics and that the situation is very difficult.” ___ Follow the AP’s coverage of the Ukraine crisis at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",World/Associated Press,Invasion jolts Russia's friends in tiny West-leaning Moldova,https://news.yahoo.com/invasion-jolts-russias-friends-tiny-095941132.html
3/13/2022,"The smartest insight and analysis, from all perspectives, rounded up from around the web: Never has a major world economy been handcuffed by the kinds of financial restrictions that have been imposed on Russia, said Patricia Cohen and Jeanna Smialek in The New York Times. Just days after Ukraine was invaded, its Western allies ""froze hundreds of billions of dollars of Russian assets held in their own financial institutions; removed Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system; and made foreign investment in the country exceedingly difficult, if not impossible."" The Russian ruble sank to a record low while Russian stocks on the London exchange lost more than 90 percent of their value last week. Russia has learned that ""autonomy is a myth in a modern globalized world."" However, ""the West's overwhelming control could encourage other nations to create alternative financial systems"" that can resist future sanctions. Disentangling a country from the current financial system is no simple task, said Gillian Tett in the Financial Times. ""The full impact of sanctions"" won't be realized until March 12, the date of formal exclusion of seven Russian banks from the SWIFT messaging system that lets institutions send and receive transfers internationally. We also simply ""do not know how a freeze of Russian assets will ricochet around interlinked contracts."" In response to the sanctions, Russia is requiring companies to pay their debts in rubles, leaving derivatives tied to $41 billion in debt in limbo, with questions about exactly what constitutes a default. The fear is that sanctions will create further problems — or ""contagion"" in the world financial system's pipeline. There was a loophole in the SWIFT penalty, said economist Noah Smith in his Substack newsletter: Russian banks can still use it for energy payments. ""Since energy is the main thing Russia exports,"" the West did not ""really unleash the full power of the SWIFT cutoff."" This week, however, President Biden announced that the U.S. would no longer buy Russian oil and gas, said Eric Levitz in New York magazine. And most of the big oil companies had already created a de facto embargo, because they ""don't want to be seen bankrolling war crimes."" ""Weaponizing the monetary system against a G-20 country will have lasting repercussions,"" said Jon Sindreu in The Wall Street Journal. To isolate itself from potential sanctions aimed at debasing its currency, Russia stockpiled one of the world's largest reserves of foreign currency — $640 billion. Half that sovereign wealth, however, is held by Western central banks that have now been cut off from dealing with Moscow. This raises questions about ""the entire artifice of 'money' as a universal store of value."" If currency balances can no longer ""guarantee buying essential stuff, Moscow would be wise to stop accumulating them"" — and other nations may follow suit. China, for example, ""owns $3.3 trillion in currency reserves"" that it now knows could be rendered worthless. It will be hard to hold all that in renminbi, but ""stockpiling commodities is an alternative."" Economists have long equated currency reserves to ""savings in a piggy bank."" The Russia sanctions may have just broken the bank. This article was first published in the latest issue of The Week magazine.

Charlene, who married Monaco's ruler Prince Albert in 2011, has been absent from the principality for months due to health problems, including what the palace has previously referred to as a ""state of profound general fatigue"". ""The next few weeks should allow for Princess Charlene to further strengthen Her health, before gradually resuming Her official duties and commitments,"" the palace said in a statement issued on Saturday. The Monaco palace has consistently denied media reports of a rift between Charlene and Prince Albert. Charlene was born in South Africa and swam for the country at the 2000 Olympic Games.

3/13/2022,"(Updates with background about NATO and chemical weapons) LONDON, March 13 (Reuters) - Poland's President Andrzej Duda said in an interview on Sunday that the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine by Russia would be a game changer and NATO would have to think seriously about how to respond. Asked if the use of chemical weapons by Putin would be a red line for NATO at which point it has to get involved, Duda told BBC television: ""If he uses any weapons of mass destruction then this will be a game changer in the whole thing."" ""For sure, the North Atlantic Alliance and its leaders led by the United States will have to sit at the table and they will really have to think seriously what to do because then it starts to be dangerous."" Since President Vladimir Putin launched the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, the United States has been concerned that the NATO alliance should not get dragged into a wider war with Russia. Western officials said on Friday that Russia might use chemical weapons in Ukraine in a ""false flag"" attack to provide a retrospective justification for its invasion, but there was nothing to suggest a broader use of such weapons in the war. On Wednesday, Washington denied renewed Russian accusations that Washington was operating biowarfare labs in Ukraine, calling the claims ""laughable"" and suggesting Moscow may be laying the groundwork to use a chemical or biological weapon. There was no immediate response from the Russian embassy in Washington to the U.S. assertions on Wednesday.
