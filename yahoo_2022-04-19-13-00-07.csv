4/19/2022,"Moscow's mayor says that 200,000 Russians in the city are likely to be without work. Hundreds of Western companies have distanced themselves from Russia, creating a dearth in jobs. Some global firms pledged to continue paying their local workers, though it's unclear for how long. Moscow's mayor said on Monday that hundreds of thousands of city residents could lose their jobs as Western companies suspend or pull their operations from Russia. ""According to our estimates, about 200,000 people are at risk of losing their jobs,"" Mayor Sergei Sobyanin wrote in an official blog post. In the post, Sobyanin said Moscow had approved an employment support program worth 3.36 billion rubles, or roughly $41 million, that would supply temporary jobs or training to those without work. Sobyanin wrote that around 58,000 employees are expected to benefit from the program and highlighted that Russia would provide a monthly allowance for children and loans for small and medium businesses. Sobyanin's comments come as Russian President Vladimir Putin continues to deny Western sanctions have impacted Russia's economy. ""We can now confidently say that such policy (of sanctions) towards Russia has failed,"" he said on Monday. ""The economic blitzkrieg strategy didn't work. Moreover, the initiators themselves couldn't get away with the sanctions."" More than 750 companies have publicly announced that they would cut operations in Russia to some degree since the invasion of Ukraine began, according to the Yale School of Management. Some companies have pledged to continue paying their Russian workers even while shuttered in the country, though it's unclear exactly how long they plan to sustain their support. McDonald's, one of the first major businesses to withdraw from Russia, said that its store closures in the country cost the company $50 million a month as it keeps its roughly 62,000 local workers on payroll. Some of its locations are still open because the franchisees who own and operate those restaurants have refused to close, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported. Sobyanin's post indicated that Moscow is still grappling with a long list of crises. City authorities will discuss in the next two weeks how the capital will maintain its stock of medicines without imports, and how it will keep its hospitality industry afloat, he wrote. ""There is a lot of work to be done, the results of which will appear only in a few years,"" wrote Sobyanin.

4/19/2022,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki again took a poke at Fox News reporter Peter Doocy on Monday, admonishing him: “You’re not a doctor.” She added: “You don’t even play one on TV — most days.” Ouch. The latest takedown occurred when Doocy asked why masks had been required on airplanes — until a federal judge’s ruling Monday that they no longer were — while they hadn’t been required in the White House briefing room. Psaki, her face a bit tighter than usual, very carefully explained — like a teacher in a grade school classroom — that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has different recommendations for different locations and situations, depending on things like COVID-19 caseloads and the density of crowds at certain events. “Well, Peter, I’m not a doctor, you’re not a doctor — that I’m aware of .... OK, not a doctor,” she said to laughter in the press room. “Nor does he play one on TV — most days.” She added: “Remember the masking guidance is green, yellow and red. We are currently in a green zone in Washington, D.C., so they’re not recommending” masking. This is “based on health considerations and data that the CDC looks at about transmissibility as we’ve seen an increase in cases on airplanes,” the press secretary explained. Psaki explained that the White House had called for a two-week extension on mask mandates on planes to “look at the data” before issuing new recommendations. Check it out in the tweet above.

4/19/2022,"A cancer diagnosis is scary. Some doctors say it’s time to rename low-grade prostate cancer to eliminate the alarming C-word. Cancer cells develop in nearly all prostates as men age, and most prostate cancers are harmless. About 34,000 Americans die from prostate cancer annually, but treating the disease can lead to sexual dysfunction and incontinence. Changing the name could lead more low-risk patients to skip unnecessary surgery and radiation. “This is the least aggressive, wimpiest form of prostate cancer that is literally incapable of causing symptoms or spreading to other parts of the body,” said University of Chicago Medicine’s Dr. Scott Eggener, who is reviving a debate about how to explain the threat to worried patients. The words “You have cancer” have a profound effect on patients, Eggener wrote Monday in Journal of Clinical Oncology. He and his co-authors say fear of the disease can cause some patients to overreact and opt for unneeded surgery or radiation. Others agree. “If you reduce anxiety, you’ll reduce overtreatment,” said Dr. David Penson of Vanderbilt University. “The word ‘cancer,’ it puts an idea in their head: ‘I have to have this treated.’” Diagnosis sometimes starts with a PSA blood test, which looks for high levels of a protein that may mean cancer but can also be caused by less serious prostate problems or even vigorous exercise. When a patient has a suspicious test result, a doctor might recommend a biopsy, which involves taking samples of tissue from the prostate gland. Next, a pathologist looks under a microscope and scores the samples for how abnormal the cells look. Often, doctors offer patients with the lowest score — Gleason 6 — a way to avoid surgery and radiation: active surveillance, which involves close monitoring but no immediate treatment. In the U.S., about 60% of low-risk patients choose active surveillance. But they might still worry. “I would be over the moon if people came up with a new name for Gleason 6 disease,” Penson said. “It will allow a lot of men to sleep better at night.” But Dr. Joel Nelson of University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, said dropping the word “cancer” would “misinform patients by telling them there’s nothing wrong. There’s nothing wrong today, but that doesn’t mean we don’t have to keep track of what we’ve discovered.” Name changes have happened previously in low-risk cancers of the bladder, cervix and thyroid. In breast cancer, there’s an ongoing debate about dropping “carcinoma” from DCIS, or ductal carcinoma in situ. In prostate cancer, the 1960s-era Gleason ranking system has evolved, which is how 6 became the lowest score. Patients may assume it’s a medium score on a scale of 1 to 10. In fact, it's the lowest on a scale of 6 to 10. What to call it instead of cancer? Proposals include IDLE for indolent lesion of epithelial origin, or INERRT for indolent neoplasm rarely requiring treatment. “I don’t really give a hoot what it’s called as long as it’s not called cancer,” Eggener said. Steve Rienks, a 72-year-old civil engineer in Naperville, Illinois, was diagnosed with Gleason 6 prostate cancer in 2014. He chose active surveillance, and follow-up biopsies in 2017 and 2021 found no evidence of cancer. Calling it something else would help patients make informed choices, Rienks said, but that’s not enough: Patients need to ask questions until they feel confident. “It’s about understanding risk,” Rienks said. “I would encourage my fellow males to educate themselves and get additional medical opinions.” ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.
