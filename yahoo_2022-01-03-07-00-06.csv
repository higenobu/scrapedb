1/3/2022,"A newborn boy was found abandoned in a cardboard box in freezing weather in Alaska on New Year’s Eve—with a heartbreaking note saying the parents did not have food or money. The temperature was just 1 degree when a Fairbanks woman spotted the blanket-filled box near her home. Alaska police said the child was taken to the hospital and “was found to be in good health.” The note left with the infant—headlined “Please help me!!!”—indicated he was born 12 weeks premature, though authorities did not confirm that. ‘My parents and grandparents don’t have food or money to raise me,” the handwritten note said. “They NEVER wanted to do this to me. “My mom is so sad to do this,” it continued. “Please take me and find me a LOVING FAMILY. My parents are begging whoever finds me. My name is Teshawn.” The note was posted in video by a Facebook user with the handle Roxy Lane. She also posted video of herself pulling back the blankets to show a baby nestled beneath. “I’ve been processing my feelings all day and running through all the different scenarios and reasons, with my bf and family, as to why something like this could have happened,” Lane wrote. She suggested that the parents might be too young to realize that Alaska has a safe haven law that allows unwanted babies to be dropped with police, firefighters, or paramedics until they are 21 days old. “I hope the mother gets the help she might need. I doubt they could have afforded to take her to the hospital and she may be in need of medical attention. Please, someone knows this new mom, check on her! She might be in a desperate situation, feeling abandoned herself,” Lane wrote. She used the discovery of Teshawn to call for unity in the Fairbanks community. “Clearly, someone in our community felt so lost and hopeless that they made probably the hardest choice of their lives to leave that innocent life on the side of the road with nothing but some blankets and a name,” she wrote. “But she named him! There's some love there, even if she made a terrible decision. I know we're all struggling, I see it. I see you. I love you all and I'm here. Today I saved a baby and I’ll probably think about Teshawn for the rest of my life.” In a message to The Daily Beast, Lane said she released the video only “in the hopes that everyone involved got the help they might need and that whatever justice needed to be served would be served.” “I only hope for more awareness in the community, and maybe some compassion for a difficult situation for everyone involved,” she said, declining an interview. The Alaska Daily News said Fairbanks Memorial Hospital reported that “the baby is doing well and very healthy.” Read more at The Daily Beast. Get our top stories in your inbox every day. Sign up now!

1/3/2022,"With Speaker Nancy Pelosi's expected exit from leadership, Democratic leaders ponder the future. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries is seen as the favorite to succeed Pelosi. Democrats have had the same leadership team in the top three positions for nearly 20 years. When Democrats regained control of the House in 2018, sixteen party members signed a letter expressing opposition to Nancy Pelosi's ascension to the speakership. At that point, Pelosi had led the House Democratic caucus since 2003 — and had previously served as speaker from 2007 to 2011 — and despite the pushback, she still had broad support from most members. In December 2018, Pelosi came to an agreement that would limit her tenure to four years as speaker, and she went on to earn the support of many of the moderate and newly-elected lawmakers who were initially resistant to her leadership. The speaker can point to many consequential pieces of legislation that she shepherded through the House, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Affordable Care Act, along with muscling President Joe Biden's domestic agenda through a closely-divided House. However, with the 2022 midterm elections in sight, Pelosi, 81, is expected to leave her post at the end of the current Congress, with Democrats anticipating a huge leadership shift that will define their party for years to come as a new generation takes hold, according to The Washington Post. For as long as Pelosi has led the caucus, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, 82, has served as both the majority leader and minority whip, while Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, 81, has been the majority whip and the party's assistant Democratic leader. In the coming years, though, the party's House leadership team is set to be dramatically different. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the current chair of the House Democratic Caucus, is the favorite to succeed Pelosi when she steps down from her position, but a debate over who will serve in leadership has just started and could potentially expose a deep gulf between progressives and moderates, according to The Post. With a growing progressive wing of the party coming into its own, there will likely be a reckoning on how the party will counter the GOP, which is still overwhelmingly defined by the influence of former President Donald Trump. Rep. Ro Khanna of California, a progressive who has been an influential liaison to the Biden White House, told The Post that the next generation of leadership will have to listen intently to members. ""I think we want leadership that bridges some of the different ideological wings of the party, that is committed to listening to all of the perspectives, that will be capable of helping move the Senate or things that have stalled in the House, and has a bold vision of what we need to achieve for the American public,"" he said. He continued: ""But whoever it is, I hope they would adopt progressive positions and also listen to the broad caucus and build consensus."" The Post interviewed over two dozen lawmakers, with members expressing deep respect for Pelosi — but with some lawmakers also eager for different leadership style. Rep. Brad Schneider of Illinois, a moderate, wants to see a leader in the mold of Pelosi. ""I want to make sure that it is someone who can pull the party together,"" he told the Post. He continued: ""As Pelosi says: 'Our diversity is our strength, and unity is our power.' I want to make sure it's someone who can hold that unity."" However, Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington State, the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, suggested that a more decentralized nucleus of power might prove to be more effective. ""I think there was a 'holding of power' model that worked very well for a long time, and I think now it is more about a recognition of different centers of focus within the Democratic caucus that have to be brought in and brought together,"" she told The Post. Members interviewed by The Post stated that Pelosi's replacement should also be as historically significant as her status as the chamber's first female speaker. If Jeffries succeeds Pelosi, he would become the first Black person in US history to lead a chamber of Congress. The members who were interviewed by The Post overwhelmingly viewed Jeffries as a skilled communicator, and one lawmaker who backs Jeffries' ascension spoke of his style in glowing terms. ""He's brilliant, he's smooth, but he is fearless,"" the lawmaker said. ""I mean, if we are fighting for something, I want Hakeem Jeffries on my side because he will go to the mat on an issue."" Hoyer and Rep. Adam Schiff, whose national profile has soared as the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, are both eyeing a run to succeed Pelosi, according to The Post. And Reps. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and Pete Aguilar of California are seen as part of the next contingent of House leaders, per the report. A major concern that has been raised among members is the realization that huge changes could result in the loss of stability that has come to define the Democratic caucus under Pelosi, Hoyer, and Clyburn — as opposed to the House Republican Caucus, which is often mired in infighting. ""She understands how to get things done and how to keep us together, even if it looks a little bit messy from the outside,"" a Democratic member told The Post. When Pelosi was asked during a November 2020 news conference if she would relinquish the speaker's gavel after the 117th Congress, she pointed to her prior commitment. ""What I said then is whether it passes or not, I will abide by those limits that are there,"" she said.

1/3/2022,"RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — In the tiny town of Lawrenceville, Virginia, a van owned by Poplar Mount Baptist Church was knocked out of commission for weeks after thieves cut the catalytic converter out of its exhaust system. Several months later, across town, a catalytic converter was ripped from a van owned by First Baptist Church. Similar crimes followed, targeting a total of 15 church vans and 13 other vehicles in town, part of a nationwide surge in thefts of catalytic converters. Thefts of the exhaust emission control devices have jumped over the past two years as prices for the precious metals they contain have skyrocketed. Thieves can expect to get anywhere from $50 to $300 if they sell the converters to scrap yards, which then sell them to recycling facilities to reclaim the precious metals inside, including platinum, palladium and rhodium. For victims, the costs of replacing a stolen catalytic converter can easily top $1,000 and make their vehicle undrivable for days or weeks as the part is ordered and installed. It can also leave owners feeling vulnerable. “Just to feel that the church property was invaded by thieves was disheartening,” said John Robinson, a member of Poplar Mount Baptist Church. Robinson said replacing the stolen converter cost about $1,000. The theft was covered by insurance, but the church had to pay its $250 deductible and was unable to use the van for six weeks as it sat in a mechanic's yard waiting for a new part. The National Insurance Crime Bureau said the number of catalytic converter thefts reported in claims to insurance companies jumped from 3,389 in 2019 to 14,433 in 2020. NICB President David Glawe said there has been a significant increase in thefts since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. “It’s an opportunistic crime,” Glawe said in a statement. ""As the value of the precious metals contained within the catalytic converters continues to increase, so do the number of thefts of these devices. There is a clear connection between times of crisis, limited resources, and disruption of the supply chain that drives investors towards these precious metals.” The increase in thefts has prompted states across the country to toughen penalties and impose new requirements for scrap metal dealers who buy the converters. Ten states enacted new legislation in 2021, including laws in Arkansas, South Carolina and Texas that require scrap metal buyers of used converters to maintain records of purchases, including proof of ownership, vehicle identification numbers, the seller's home address and driver's license numbers, according to the insurance crime bureau. In North Carolina, a law that went into effect Dec. 1 makes catalytic converter thefts a Class I felony and requires businesses that buy used catalytic converters to get documentation and maintain detailed records on people who sell the devices to them. A bill modeled after the North Carolina law will be introduced in Virginia when the legislature reconvenes in January. The measure would make the theft of a catalytic converter a felony and presume that anyone in possession of one that's been removed from a vehicle has obtained it illegally unless the person is an authorized scrap seller or has a bill of sale, receipt or other documentation. “It would make it more risky for the thieves to steal them,” said Sen. Frank Ruff Jr., who is sponsoring the bill. “The sellers would have to show more identification, and then at the same time, the salvage dealer would not want to get in trouble so he'd be less likely to allow them to sell to him.” Brunswick County Sheriff Brian Roberts, who has seen the number of thefts in his rural area grow from seven to nine annually to 28 this year, said converters can be stolen in minutes. Thieves need only crawl under a vehicle and use a battery-operated reciprocating saw to cut through the metal and remove the part, he said. In Henrico County, where about 540 catalytic converters have been reported stolen this year, police have produced public service announcements to raise awareness. David Overby, owner of Auto Repairs Plus, said he spent more than $5,000 on lighting and a security system with cameras after thieves repeatedly stole catalytic converters off his customers' cars in his parking lot. Overby said police arrested two people caught on his cameras stealing converters, but he said under the current law, they were only charged with a misdemeanor. “These people have got to be held accountable in some way, not given a slap on their wrist,"" Overby said. At Chesterfield Auto Parts, where customers can pull parts from junked cars, owner Troy Webber said his workers remove catalytic converters before the vehicles are made available to the public, then lock the devices in steel containers before selling them to auto recyclers. That doesn’t stop thieves from trying to break in, he said. “People cut through our fence constantly to try to steal the catalytic converters,” he said. Henrico police Chief Eric English said catalytic converters have been cut from vehicles parked in homeowners' driveways. Police have advised people about theft prevention measures, including protective shields and covers for the converters. They've also offered to stencil a mark on catalytic converters to allow scrap yard dealers and recyclers to more easily identity a stolen converter. “It's definitely something we have to get a hold of because it's causing a lot of families and a lot of people some heartburn,” English said. “It's not something people deserve to have happen to them.”",U.S./Associated Press,Police struggle to deter rising catalytic converter thefts,https://news.yahoo.com/police-struggle-deter-rising-catalytic-140259890.html
