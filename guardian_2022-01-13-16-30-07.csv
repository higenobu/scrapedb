1/13/2022,"Now arguably more than ever, it’s hard to predict what will and won’t connect with cinemagoers over the next 12 months, a tumultuous time of uncertainty extending until an unknowable date. While the rough release schedule is more than certain to change (a number of January releases have already moved as a result of Omicron), what it does do is show us what the industry is banking on right now, outside of the bread-and-butter business of superheroes. Here’s a look at what you’ll be seeing the most of in 2022:  It seems odd that a genre as reliably rewarding as the whodunnit was ever not in fashion but after star-packed murder mysteries dominated the multiplex throughout the 70s and 80s, the years since saw a retreat to the small screen. It took Kenneth Branagh’s lavish, if creatively redundant, remake of Murder on the Orient Express to remind studios of audience interest, making a shock $351m worldwide back in 2017. This year sees the belated follow-up, a redo of Death on the Nile with a slightly less impressively starry cast – Penélope Cruz, Johnny Depp, Judi Dench and Michelle Pfeiffer replaced with Gal Gadot, Armie Hammer, Russell Brand and Annette Bening – landing in February. Later this year will also see a Netflix sequel to Rian Johnson’s 2019 hit Knives Out, officially untitled as of now but tentatively called Knives Out 2 because probably, bringing back Daniel Craig and sending him to Greece to find a killer from a cast including Kathryn Hahn, Edward Norton, Janelle Monáe and Kate Hudson. The streamer paid over $450m for the rights to the franchise. Saoirse Ronan and Sam Rockwell will also hunt for a murderer in the West End in See How They Run, with a cast of suspects including Ruth Wilson, David Oyelowo and Adrien Brody. A high school reunion ends in murder in the comedy Reunion which stars Jillian Bell and Lil Rel Howery (a set-up that’s almost identical to Apple’s new series The Afterparty with Tiffany Haddish and Ilana Glazer) while Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston are currently filming Murder Mystery 2 for Netflix so that could also be a late addition. Another once-prolific genre that then fell out of favour, the slasher has seen a surprise resurgence in the past few years thanks to the box office success of Happy Death Day and the return of Halloween. Cheaply produced and based on an easily replicated formula, it’s also found its obvious place within the world of streaming with Netflix’s Fear Street trilogy and There’s Someone Inside Your House and Amazon’s I Know What You Did Last Summer remake. This month sees the inevitable return of Ghostface in Scream, a much-anticipated franchise-restarter bringing back the original Campbell-Cox-Arquette trio for more meta mayhem (if it makes as much as analysts predict it could lead to even more slashers in 2023). Next month, Leatherface follows suit in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, a tortured production sold to Netflix during the pandemic, another attempt to relaunch the grimy gore-heavy series, with Don’t Breathe’s Fede Alvarez involved as writer-producer and Eighth Grade’s Elsie Fisher starring. Michael Myers will also be making his “final” stab at killing Laurie Strode, AKA Jamie Lee Curtis, later in the year with Halloween Ends but the mammoth box office for his return might extend the originally envisioned trilogy. There’s also the intriguing prospect of an A24 slasher from Cat Person’s Kristen Roupenian called Bodies, Bodies, Bodies about a game that goes awry starring Maria Bakalova, Amandla Stenberg and Pete Davidson. While science-fiction that tackles something a little chewier than whether Godzilla or Kong can punch the hardest is never exactly not a thing, the next year provides a steadier stream than usual of options aiming more for mind over matter. After a premiere at Cannes last summer, Columbus director Kogonada’s After Yang will hit cinemas in March, a quiet drama with Colin Farrell and Jodie Turner-Smith about a family trying to save their live-in robot from extinction. David Cronenberg returns later this year with Crimes of the Future, a horror-tinged sci-fi tale set in a distant future where people explore “the limitless potential of transhumanism”, said people including Kristen Stewart and Viggo Mortensen. Cronenberg’s son Brandon will also follow his well-received Sundance hit Possessor with Infinity Pool, a thriller starring Alexander Skarsgård and Mia Goth as a rich couple who discover something unusual beyond the gates of their all-inclusive resort. Yorgos Lanthimos is also reuniting with The Favourite screenwriter Tony McNamara and star Emma Stone for Poor Things, a Victorian era Frankenstein-esque tale of a woman brought back to life by a scientist who replaces her brain with that of her unborn child. One of the most intriguing big bets comes from the Mad Max director George Miller and his epic romance Three Thousand Years of Longing about a lonely scholar whose encounter with a wish-granting djinn leads to unexpected consequences. And while plot details are yet to be revealed, Jordan Peele’s mysterious new film Nope, starring Daniel Kaluuya, has debuted a poster that hints at a sci-fi mind-trip. A look ahead at any year in the past five decades would show an unhealthy smattering of 2s, 3s and colons but in 2022, there’s a more specific form of sequel that’s set to dominate. Long-awaited, fan-petitioned follow-ups will be cosying up against the more expected superhero fare, studios betting on nostalgia to drive audiences out to the big screen or to stream. The aforementioned Scream is the first big test, to see if a 90s-born franchise can still pack ’em in, weeks before Paramount also bets on Jackass Forever, the first entry from the team since 2010. The oft-delayed Top Gun: Maverick will also test if audiences still feel the need for both speed and Tom Cruise outside of the Mission: Impossible franchise (his only fruitful endeavour these days). Reese Witherspoon’s belated return as Elle Woods in Legally Blonde 3 is allegedly set for a summer release (although recent reports suggest that might not happen) with help from Mindy Kaling scripting. Halloween will see the return of sister witches Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy in Hocus Pocus 2, after much fan speculation, haunting a new generation on Disney+ while the platform will also see Amy Adams returning as a fish-out-of-water princess in Disenchanted. And finally, Kevin Smith will complete his cult comedy trilogy with Clerks III. It might be a surprise to anyone who doesn’t spend hours scouring the very bottom rows of the streaming underworld but Bruce Willis is working harder than you, I or anyone we know. His admirably consistent brand of cheaply made action thrillers is ever-expanding (he was in nine films in 2021) and in 2022, he will star in another 10 VHS-era films tailored toward the most undemanding of viewers. In the next 12 months, he will be “seen” in Gasoline Alley with Luke Wilson, Fortress 2 with Shannen Doherty, A Day to Die with Frank Grillo, The Wrong Place with Ashley Greene, Vendetta with Mike Tyson, Corrective Measures with Michael Rooker, Die Like Lovers with Dominic Purcell, White Elephant with John Malkovich, Paradise City with John Travolta and Wire Room with Kevin Dillon.",Arts/Film,From whodunnits to cerebral sci-fi: what movie trends will 2022 bring?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/13/2022-movie-trends-whodunnits-cerebral-sci-fi
1/13/2022,"Sunlight slants through the woodsmoke. Inside a big, fairy-lit tipi, tables are decked with candles and fresh maple branches. I’m just starting a five-day car-free break in the Chilterns, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) with easy access by train, Metropolitan Line tube, and two new bus routes that started in August 2021. My favourite car-free walk in the area is a circuit from Tring station up the Ridgeway to Ivinghoe Beacon and back via the Ashridge Estate. I’m hoping for woodland walks, country pubs and seasonal produce, so a gourmet lunch under the trees feels like a perfect beginning. Outdoor dining company Nomadic has been hosting elegant meals here in Shrubs Wood for three years, sourcing fruit, veg and herbs from its garden nearby.  Today’s fungi-themed feast starts with a walk through the trees. Professional foragers Izzy (@rightsforweeds) and Ru (@londonwildfruits) lead us from glade to glade like woodland elves, pointing out edible and deadly toadstools with equal delight. They are particularly enthusiastic about a little row of hare’s-foot inkcaps, which range from a bullet-shaped bulb to a tall, upturned parasol, showing the “stages of mushroom morphology”. Lunch includes truffle-laced shiitake soup, hen of the woods on toast, roast halibut topped with ceps and chanterelles, and a pear and apple compote from the orchard. It’s clearly a winning formula: despite the eye-watering price tag of £99, everyone I talk to here to has been at least once before. Nomadic plans to kick off 2022’s feasts with some Valentine-themed meals in February and regular lunch dates from March, including events surrounded by April bluebells. Getting here without a car helps both atmosphere and appetite. Bus 105 from Amersham stops 20 minutes away, or Nomadic can recommend a taxi from Chalfont and Latimer, but I decide to walk three miles from Chorleywood station, along my first short stretch of the long-distance Chiltern Way, which rambles for more than 100 miles through the AONB. I follow the route into the woods along Old Shire Lane. Squirrels chase each other through the chestnut branches, dislodging twinkling showers of last night’s rain on to shiny conkers that line the path like cobblestones. A jay, pink with a flash of turquoise, lands nearby, red kites circle the sky and a tiny fieldmouse scurries into the long grass. Red kites, with their forked tails and 1.5-metre wingspans, were reintroduced in the Chilterns in the early 1990s and there are now more than 1,000 breeding pairs. It’s a great walk until I leave the Chiltern Way and spend the last three minutes dodging into roadside holly bushes to avoid the vans on flooded Gorelands Lane. A welcome drink by the campfire, involving crème de châtaigne liqueur and marigold petals, goes straight to my head. The other guests are still toasting marshmallows and sipping pine needle tea round the bonfire as, four hours later, I shoulder my rucksack again and head round the corner to the Chilterns Open Air Museum (adult £7.50 online, coam.org.uk). This veteran collection of reconstructed local buildings has fruit-laden trees in the orchards, pumpkins and corn dollies in a mission room, and marrows for sale in the shop. But it’s not all thatched barns and cottages with patchwork bedspreads; there’s a tollhouse from High Wycombe and a prefab bungalow from Amersham, wartime Nissen huts and even an Edwardian cast-iron public loo. With Pinewood Studios nine miles away, the museum is a favourite film location. I’m staying in the village of Chalfont St Giles, another mile along the Chiltern Way. The cheerful White Hart Inn, near the Quaker hamlet of Jordans, is a modern pub that offers an age-old-coaching-inn vibe with real ales and weathered beams; bedrooms are in annexes off the grassy beer garden (doubles from about £60 room only or £75 B&B, greenekinginns.co.uk). There are plenty of fancier places to stay in the Chilterns, but big, ready-to-ramble breakfasts and seriously comfortable beds make it a good walkers’ base. There’s food in the evenings too, with a classic pub-grub menu (£16.99 for three courses) and seasonal specials such as maple-and-rosemary-glazed plum pannacotta or an autumn spritz that mixes sloe gin, Aperol and prosecco. There’s a bus stop outside the pub, but my first day’s walking is a circuit from the door, partly along the River Misbourne, which spends a little too much time within earshot of the main road. This is one of several routes near chalk streams in the Chilterns. The most rewarding is the 10-mile Chess Valley walk from Rickmansworth to Chesham, passing close to Chenies Manor, with its brick chimneys and gables and borders of lavender and cranesbill (£6, cheniesmanorhouse.co.uk). The highlight of today’s walk is a visit to the old cottage where John Milton lived and finished Paradise Lost (£7, miltonscottage.org). The poet moved here from London in 1665, escaping the great plague; his friend Thomas Ellwood hired the cottage for him, calling it “that pretty box in Giles, Chalfonte”. The cottage garden, scented with pale-pink climbing roses and flowering marjoram, echoes Milton’s descriptions of Eden. There are dark bunches of grapes hanging from the century-old vine that wraps the brickwork (“the mantling vine / Lays forth her purple grape, and gently creeps / Luxuriant”) and red apples in the little orchard. It’s only after I’ve picked one (with permission) that I notice the statue of Eve nearby and a replica snake coiled round the tree trunk. Bekonscot model village in Beaconsfield, next morning, is just as I remember it from childhood: a John Major-esque 1930s landscape of cricket on the green, trawlers in the quay and morris dancers in the town square (adult £11.30, bekonscot.co.uk). The children’s author Enid Blyton lived nearby. Her house, Green Hedges, is long gone, but a model remains at Bekonscot with a little Noddy car outside. Beaconsfield is 20 minutes from my pub by bus and half an hour from London on the train. I meet friends at the station to hike in the hills under gold-tinted beech leaves and stop at the Royal Standard of England for a pint of Chiltern pale ale. Every log-fire-warmed corner of this ancient, rambling pub is crammed with decorative details: carved bears, unicorn tapestries, stained glass, tankards and toby jugs, even the curving side of an old ship. Next day I catch bus 104 again to High Wycombe, 10 miles west, for another day of hiking and sightseeing. I stop off on the way for a picnic from Beaconsfield’s Tuesday market. Four of the Chiltern Hundreds buses link the two towns. Wycombe Museum reminds visitors that this town was once the world’s chair-making capital (free, wycombemuseum.org.uk). Many of the area’s beechwoods were planted in the 18th century to grow timber for the furniture industry. Another 10 minutes on bus 40 brings me to West Wycombe, where eccentric, 18th-century aristocrat Sir Francis Dashwood convened his Hellfire Club in caves dug out underneath the Chiltern hills (adult £8.50, hellfirecaves.co.uk). I wander a quarter of a mile into subterranean depths, past fanciful dioramas, before setting off on an undulating circuit through woods and fields, past the hilltop Dashwood Mausoleum. Something about the Chilterns seems to inspire kids’ writers in particular. Alison Uttley wrote her Little Grey Rabbit books in Beaconsfield, and my last day is spent stalking Roald Dahl through the village of Great Missenden. I ride bus 105 past valley views to Amersham and then one stop on the train. This railway from London Marylebone is great for car-free access to the Chilterns. I’ve walked at least a dozen circuits from Wendover station, most recently in May this year at the height of a late, lush bluebell season. And I’ve caught the train to Aylesbury for the market, museum, Bowie memorial and bus to Waddesdon Manor, which also has a car-free Greenway from the last station on the line and a spectacular Christmas light trail until 23 January. There’s a colourful year-round Roald Dahl museum with Willy Wonka-style gates (£4.90/£7.40 child/adult, goodjourney.org.uk) on Great Missenden High Street with leaflets outside suggesting village and countryside trails through the woods. A half-timbered house and red petrol pumps over the road feature in his stories. I follow Church Lane over the A413 to search for Dahl’s grave in the ivy-covered churchyard and find it under a bench-ringed beech tree with concrete BFG footprints in the grass nearby. Heading back to the village through parkland, I enjoy views across a lake to Missenden Abbey, where figures in white are playing croquet on the lawn. Down the road, the Nag’s Head is covered in scarlet creeper. Inside, there are low beams, autumn roses on the tables, and seasonal fruit on the menu, from stone bass with late rhubarb to chocolate with poached apricots. The 15th-century pub is adding seven new bedrooms for next year. After butternut soup and cake with blackberry sorbet, I’m ready to set off again, past time-worn brick cottages with roses and honeysuckle straggling over the doorways. Reliance on cars is the most obvious downside of this rural idyll and I’m relieved to turn off a pavement-less road into trees again, where rustling leaves eventually overtake the noise of traffic. At teatime, I’m sitting in the middle of a wood by a campfire while a blackened kettle bubbles above the flames. It feels miles from anywhere, but is just 20 minutes’ walk from Chalfont & Latimer station. David Willis teaches bushcraft, which he distinguishes from survival skills as being more about love of nature. Families and small groups spend hours with him in the woods, building dens, whittling spoons and rubbing sticks to make fire (£95pp, £150 family, davidwillis.info). He points out the different tactile qualities of the trees around us: claw-marked cherry trunks, muscular hornbeams, soft larch needles. There are badgers living nearby, and squirrels race past with sweet chestnuts. As I walk back towards the train, two roe deer stand transfixed in a sunset field of stubble and mewing buzzards wheel slowly over the woods.Bus travel was provided by Carousel.

1/13/2022,"The Omicron variant has unleashed a tidal wave of Covid that is sweeping through countries at breakneck speed. In the UK, infections soared to unprecedented highs in recent weeks, but may finally have reached a peak. So what is in store on the other side of the wave?  Mass vaccination, boosters, and the spectacular infection rates seen in the Omicron wave are building high levels of population immunity that will drive infection rates down. The wave will peak at different times from place to place, with adherence to Plan B and shifts in people’s behaviour before and after Christmas all playing into the timing and speed at which infections fall. While the Office for National Statistics said infections were still rising in England last week, the wave may already have peaked in London. Not in the foreseeable future. The more likely scenario is that Omicron continues to circulate, with cases rising and falling in line with people’s mixing patterns and changes to measures that prevent transmission. When plan B is lifted and more people return to work, cases may well rise. But in the summer, as people spend more time outdoors, infections may fall again, then rise next winter. It will all come down to human behaviour. People may feel safer and socialise more as cases come down, sending infections up again. The virus won’t be wiped out because waning immunity means there will be a constant supply of people who are newly susceptible to the infection. Before the Omicron wave hit, about 5% of the UK population had no immunity to Covid, either through vaccination or past infection. Most of the severe disease caused by Omicron has occurred in this group of people. On the other side of the Omicron wave, there will be hardly anyone who hasn’t got some immunity from infection or vaccination and this should help to keep hospital admissions down. But Omicron is still spreading fast, with nearly four million people infected in England alone last week. While infection rates appear to have stalled in the under-50s, they are rising in older, more vulnerable age groups. It still isn’t clear how severe Omicron can be in older people who had their boosters early and may now be seeing that immunity wane. If cases keep falling, then population immunity and the arrival of new antiviral drugs that aim to slash hospitalisation rates, will help the UK emerge from the crisis. “We can definitely start planning for the future in which we are treating Covid like other diseases, but we aren’t there yet,” said Prof Rowland Kao, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh. With Omicron spreading fast and causing less severe disease, some researchers believe it is time to rethink how Test and Trace is done. “I think we are already at the point where PCR testing is a waste of resources, and contact tracing is probably a waste of resources too,” said Tim Colbourn, professor of global health systems and epidemiology at UCL. One option is to rely more on lateral flow tests and for people to message their close contacts whenever they test positive. Other measures, such as pool testing samples from groups of people, and wastewater surveillance for the virus could flag new outbreaks, Prof Kao said, while some physical distancing and mask wearing in crowded places would continue to keep cases down. “We mustn’t forget that vulnerable groups will still likely remain more vulnerable,” Kao said. More Covid variants are inevitable and, like Omicron, they will have to evade immunity to some extent to spread widely. The key to reducing the risk of new variants is driving down case rates globally, but to date, vaccine hoarding and the widespread use of boosters in wealthier countries has left vast swathes of the world under-vaccinated. New variants may emerge from mutations in Omicron or other variants that are still in circulation. Not necessarily. The Alpha variant was more virulent than the original Covid virus that emerged from China, and the Delta variant was more virulent still. Omicron is somewhat milder, but there is no guarantee that future variants will be. The good news is that so far, even though several variants have developed resistance to antibodies, meaning they can spread among people who have immunity, so-called T cell defences have proved far more robust. The T cell defences are crucial for preventing hospitalisations and may continue to hold up well against future variants. That’s the hope. This year, doctors will have access to at least two new antiviral drugs, Pfizer’s paxlovid and Merck’s molnupiravir. Both are aimed at those most likely to become severely ill with Covid. If taken soon enough after infection, paxlovid and molnupiravir can reduce hospitalisations by 89% and 30% respectively. “At the beginning of the pandemic, Covid was by far the leading cause of death,” said Prof Colbourn. “This year we should be able to reduce the burden of Covid by 95% of what it was then, and it could fall out of the top 10 public health problems by May or June. The next test will be the next variant.”",News/World news,What lies on the other side of the UK’s Omicron wave? ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/13/what-lies-on-the-other-side-of-the-uks-omicron-wave
1/13/2022,"Iwas chatting to some locals in a village somewhere over Christmas. They were bemoaning various decisions that had been made – to the detriment, in their view, of the community. There was planning stuff, blocked sewers, restrictions demanded by a preservation society, highways and so on. These people weren’t professional moaners, or even keen amateur moaners. They were just exasperated. I opened my mouth to impart some sage advice, but nothing came out, as it dawned me that I knew nothing of any use to them. I have no clear idea where the power lies. Is it the parish council, the county council, the regional government or central government? And where does the local member of parliament fit in to all this? As a voter in a democratic society, it is surely critical for me to know who is responsible for what, so I know who to blame or praise, who to vote in or out and who to try to influence. I really don’t. Perhaps it’s just me.  I thought I understood the point of local democracy, but if no one can fathom its byzantine ins and outs there surely is no point. Take Manchester. I know that Andy Burnham is the mayor. But, in that case, I wondered, what is Bev Craig, the leader of Manchester city council, for? Oh, I see: Craig is the leader of just one of the 10 city councils that make up the Greater Manchester combined authority, a body that has an 11th member and chair, the mayor Andy Burnham. OK, got it, I think. But to whom would I would speak if I lived in the middle of Manchester and was displeased about, say, the state of Piccadilly Gardens? Is it Lucy Powell, the MP for the area? Or could it be one of the three councillors for that ward, their council leader, Craig, or her sort-of leader, Burnham? This is nothing against these people, or Manchester generally; I’d have the same questions about anywhere. Please, someone, explain.

1/13/2022,"Two councils in Sydney are considering permanently banning hydrofoil surfing at their beaches due to concerns over safety. Randwick and Waverley councils, both in Sydney’s east, cover some of Sydney’s most high profile beaches, including Clovelly, Coogee, Maroubra, Bronte, Bondi and Tamarama.  Hydrofoil boards began gaining traction in 2019, and are a unique take on surfing, with riders mounting a board that features a special fin mounted on a long strut below the board. Some are fitted with electric motors. The device allows surfers to catch waves even on flat water, with the fin lifting the board above the surface. Riders can reach speeds of up to 40km/h, and the boards have begun increasing in popularity, with riding groups popping up across the east coast. But the boards have been at the centre of ongoing debates over their safety and suitability for use at popular beaches, with Waverley Council already initiating an unofficial ban on the sport. For Andrew Crawford from H20 Foils, a hydrofoil and e-foil training, rental and purchase business, the concerns are not unfounded. “In reality, there’s an element of danger, the same as there is with a conventional surfboard,” he said. “There’s a danger of the boards and the fins making contacts with people’s heads. “Because there’s an extended mast, which is like a knife in the water, and the wing which is attached to the bottom of the mast, if it does come in contact with people, it could cause quite an injury. “From that perspective, I can see the council’s wariness.” But Crawford, who has been foiling for four years, said that the danger ultimately came down to rider training, and that with regulation, the sport can be made safe for beaches. “There’s quite a process in learning to ride them, especially from a safety perspective. That’s where the real danger can come from, if someone has no idea what to do. “It’s in the hands of the operator, the same as with cars on the road. If handled sensibly, I don’t see a major issue, as long as they keep well clear of designated swimming areas and other surfers. “And generally they do, because they are riding a different part of the swell, they’re looking for unbroken waves.” A spokesperson for Waverley council told Guardian Australia safety issues were their main concern, while adding that there have been no reported injuries from the boards yet. “For safety reasons, hydrofoil surfboards are not permitted at our beaches. This is due to the safety risks posed by their high speed [compared to that of a surfboard], the metal-like keel that raises the board out of the water and the usually crowded conditions in the water. “We do not have any reported instances of injuries involving these boards due to the low volume of foil boarders visiting our beaches and the proactive approach by the lifeguards. “Council is aware of injuries at other beaches/waterways caused by foil boards that have resulted in significant trauma to the casualty.” Randwick city council said they were working with Surfing NSW to gather feedback on a potential ban, and will be presenting a report on the matter in the next month. They said the proposed ban is being considered after members of the public raised safety concerns. “The proposal was prompted by ongoing safety concerns being raised by members of the public and Randwick Council beach lifeguards, in regards to foil boards being used on heavily populated beaches in the LGA. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “In addition to this, the NSW Local Government Coastal Safety Group also confirmed their collective concern about the safety of foil boards being used in areas with swimmers, bathers and beach users.” The Northern Beaches council said they were “monitoring” the situation, but said there were no bans in place at the moment. “The use of hydrofoil craft is becoming more popular and Northern Beaches council is monitoring the situation. There are currently no bans in place on the Northern Beaches. “Like the majority of hard bodied water craft they are not allowed in patrolled swimming zones and this is policed by council lifeguards.” The final decision on the potential ban in Waverley and Randwick is due later in 2022.",News/Australia news,Hydrofoil surfing could be banned at some of Sydney’s most popular beaches,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/13/hydrofoil-surfing-could-be-banned-at-some-of-sydneys-most-popular-beaches
1/13/2022,"Hello, Warren Murray here, thank you all for coming. I am pretty sure this is a work thing, but in any event I am only staying briefly.  Boris Johnson’s prime ministership hangs in the balance with Conservative MPs openly calling for his resignation after he admitted attending a garden party in lockdown, claiming he thought it was a “work event”. Johnson delivered a carefully worded apology about the alcohol-fuelled gathering of up to 40 officials in May 2020, which was described in an email invitation as “socially distanced drinks” in the warm weather. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has called for Johnson to “do the decent thing and resign”, castigating the prime minister as “a man without shame” and someone the British public widely viewed as a liar. After Johnson’s statement, one of the Conservatives’ most senior backbenchers, William Wragg, and Douglas Ross, the leader of the party in Scotland, publicly called for the PM to resign. Two possible challengers for the prime minister – the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the foreign secretary, Liz Truss – held back for much of the day before tweeting their support for the apology. Some MPs said the prime minister appeared less contrite in private conversations than in his apology. One Tory adviser predicted the prime minister had 72 hours to turn things around. The inquiry that is being held into the Downing Street parties should be given greater independence from No 10, former civil servants and a union leader have warned this morning, amid concerns the prime minister could veto the findings of Sue Gray if she recommends he be investigated under the ministerial code. “The prime minister himself gets to decide if he needs to be investigated under the ministerial code,” said Dave Penman, the head of the FDA union for senior civil servants. Djokovic into Australian Open – Novak Djokovic has just now been included in the draw for the Australian Open, which starts on Monday. Australia’s immigration minister, Alex Hawke, has said this morning that a decision has not been made on whether he will overturn the player’s visa. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, stressed a short time ago that people entering the country must be double vaccinated, and that authorities must implement Covid entry rules – remarks that placed Djokovic’s effort to play in the Australian Open in fresh doubt. Outcry over anti-protest powers – Activist groups are urging Labour to oppose a policing bill they say will undermine the right to protest at a critical moment in the climate crisis. The bill includes powers for the home secretary to ban marches and demonstrations that might be “seriously disruptive” or too noisy; a criminal offence of obstructing infrastructure such as roads, railways, airports, oil refineries and printing presses; jail sentences for attaching or locking on to someone or something; bans on named individuals from demonstrating or going on the internet to encourage others; police stop-and-search powers to look for protest-related items; and up to 10 years’ prison for damaging memorials or statues. The bill is going through the Lords this week and next. Prince Andrew faces trial prospect – Prince Andrew is facing a lengthy and embarrassing legal ordeal with the lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre in Manhattan likely to go to trial by jury, US legal experts say. It comes after a New York judge refused to throw out a civil case over allegations that Andrew sexually assaulted Giuffre when she was 17 years old. The Duke of York has been forced to scale back his royal duties in the wake of the allegations, which he strenuously denies. Watch out, tyrants told – Human Rights Watch has released its World Report 2022 in which it argues increased repression and violence by autocrats and military regimes are signs of their desperation and weakening grip on power. It says opposition parties are forming alliances to challenge the corrupt or repressive for power. HRW points to the Czech Republic, where the PM, Andrej Babiš, was defeated, and Israel, where Benjamin Netanyahu lost the prime ministership after 12 years in power. Electoral alliances are also lining up against Viktor Orbán in Hungary and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey. The HRW director, Kenneth Roth, argues that repression and “overt electoral charades” in countries such as Russia and Nicaragua should be seen as a sign of weakness, not strength. “There is a narrative that autocrats are prevailing and democracy is on the decline, yet if you look at the trends in human rights over the last 12 months it doesn’t look so rosy for the autocrats.” Omicron crisis in care staffing – Care homes are missing a third of the staff they need and more than one in four have closed their doors to new admissions in a deepening labour crisis that is “putting safety and dignity at risk”, according to the National Care Forum (NCF).
