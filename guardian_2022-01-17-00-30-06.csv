1/17/2022,"Saturday Night Live returns from hiatus with a message from Joe Biden (James Austin Johnson). The President is exhausted and frustrated by our “cold, dark winter” of Covid resurgence, but he knows how to make the virus go away: “STOP. SEEING. SPIDER-MAN. Think about it: when did Spider-Man come out? December 17th. When did every single person get Omicron? The week after December 17th. Stop seeing Spider-Man!”  Fielding questions from a skeptical press corps, Biden ties all of our continuing crises on Spider-Man: Inflation? “Spider-Man!” Voting rights? “You think people can focus on voting rights when Spider-Man’s Aunt May is a smokeshow?” Russian troops moving on the Ukrainian border? “If that doesn’t sound like a job for Spider-Man, I don’t know what is!” We’re then visited from an alternate version of Joe Biden (Pete Davidson) from a different world within the multiverse, who reveals that our collapsing timelines was started as “a joke in 2016 when the Chicago Cubs won the World Series”. He also reveals that everyone in the “real world” is better off … except for Pete Davidson. “Your world is maybe more fun for him,” he says, offering zero in the way explanation (or punchline). While not a great cold open by any means, it at least has an actual narrative arc. It certainly beats the rambling, walk-on riddled cold opens we were getting prior to the break. That makes it a step in the right direction. West Side Story co-star and Golden Globe winner Ariana DeBose hosts for the first time. The young breakout actor is proud to represent not only the Afro-Latino community, but the Broadway community. Feeling like everyone “needs a little Broadway right now”, she sings a medley of songs from her film alongside West Side Story super-fan Kate McKinnon (who, like general audiences, stayed away from the movie while it was in theaters). DeBose nails the classic tunes, but the whole thing is unfortunately hampered by McKinnon, who does nothing but sing slightly off key and wriggle her limbs. As far as West Side Story sketches go, the show has given us much better. An NBA halftime show on TNT covers a game between the Brooklyn Nets and Sacramento Kings, currently scored at 268 -1. Sacramento’s players and coaches all tested positive for Covid right as the game was about to start and had to be replaced by fans and custodial staff. The interviews with the brutalized Kings stand-ins hit the same beats and grow tiresome fast, but the back and forth between show hosts Charles Barkley (Kenan Thompson) and Yao Ming (Bowen Yang, playing Yang by way of Lurch from The Addams Family) is a constant source of amusement. Following up on the recently released trailer their forthcoming series Bel-Air – a dramatic reimagining of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air — Peacock debuts a teaser for “the next 90s show about the black experience to be given a serious, high stakes remake”: Family Matters. This new version, titled simply Urkel, gives audiences “the goofy characters you loved in the 90s with absolutely none of the fun or charm”. Steve Urkel (Chris Redd) is now an angry nerd from a broken home, trying to stay alive on the mean streets of “Chi-raq”, while neighbor Carl (Thompson) is gritty cop with a hair trigger temper. It’s almost impossible for SNL to properly parody Bel-Air, given how preposterous it already is, but they do a solid job here. This is followed by a commercial for Ron and Donna Lacatza’s Formal Emporium, in which the husband and wife owners (Davidson and Sarah Sherman) of a girls’ dress rental shop spend all their time humiliating their teenage son Donovan (Andrew Dismukes), an awkward nerd with constantly smeared lips, a “soupy, wet ass”, and a violently unhinged love of the song Get Low. The sketch is admirably gross showcase for Dismukes – quickly eclipsing Kyle Mooney as the SNL’s go-to dweeb – but the other cast members don’t acquit themselves quite so well. Davidson’s Adam Sandler impersonation is so blatant its distracting, while Sherman’s one-note performance is utterly indistinguishable from every other character she’s portrayed thus far (including herself during her Weekend Update appearance). Next, Redd plays new NYC mayor and “friskiest uncle at the barbeque” Eric Adams, who’s obsessed with bringing “swagger” back to his city. Antagonistically fielding questions from the press, he defends the various controversies already plaguing his administration, such as his decision to keep schools open amidst the Omicron surge (“There are too many swagless parents out there giving their kids no swagger at home”), his insults towards “unskilled” workers (“By unskilled workers, I meant folks with trash jobs”) and appointing his brother as head of his security detail (“JFK appointed his brother … but unlike JFK, I’m not gonna get popped in the head, I’m gonna receive some!”). Redd brings a little too much legitimate swagger to his characterization of Adams, but the impersonation is dead-on. The night’s musical guest is Bleachers, who performs How Dare You Want More. On Weekend Update, Michael Che invites Sesame Street’s Elmo (Chloe Fineman) to comment about his rivalry with pet rock Rocko. Elmo apologizes and attempts to move on, until Che brings on Rocko, sending Elmo into a jealous rage. This segment represents that absolute worst quality of the show today: its shameless regurgitation of popular social media memes. For Saturday Night Live to swoop in and try to squeeze some more relevance out ready-made jokes is downright insulting. The only thing keeping a sketch like this from being outright plagiarism is the lack of authorship inherent to memes. In the fourth Sound of Music parody the show has done since 2016, DeBose plays the new nanny of the von Trapp children. She attempts to teach the kids how to sing using a random array of references to Homer Simpson, Queen Latifah, Peter Gabriel, IUDs and more. There’s a palpable theater kid energy to the proceedings that should entertain Broadway nerds even as it bores everyone else. Bleachers returns to the stage to perform Chinatown. Then, Debose and McKinnon play married academic giving a “sold out free lecture” at Cornell University on the ancient Greek poet Sappho. Their peers question whether their translations of newly discovered poems have been influenced by their personal lives, given that the verses contain arguments with a former lover named Nancy, references to “Helen of Generes” and Gillian Anderson, and Indigo Girl lyrics. The closing sketch is set at Texarkana chain restaurant Longhorns on New Year’s Eve. The frustrated kitchen staff question why their shift manager adds “lurrr” to the end of every sentence, leading to a fight and then a reconciliation. An utterly laugh-free sketch where the only aim seems to be finding out which cast member can do the worst accent (DeBose takes it by a mile). It’s not particularly offensive in and of itself, but coming as it does at the end of an episode that fairly reeked of East Coast superiority – what with the toothless sketches centered around Broadway shows, New York politics and liberal academia – it can’t help but leave a bad taste in the mouth. It feels like were watching a bunch of smug high school theater kids poking fun at the poor, dumb hayseeds at their school. The episode had a few redeeming moments – mostly courtesy of Redd, who continues to grow into one of the show’s most reliable performers – but it saw a noticeable drop-off in quality around the half-way mark from which it never recovered.",Arts/Television & radio,Saturday Night Live: West Side Story’s Ariana DeBose hosts underwhelming episode,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/16/saturday-night-live-west-side-story-ariana-debose-hosts
1/17/2022,"Rafael Benítez has been sacked by Everton, following the club’s disastrous 2-1 defeat by fellow strugglers Norwich City. The result means Everton have taken just five points from their last 12 games, leaving them in 15th, just six points from the relegation zone. Benítez leaves with a win percentage of 26% – the worst record of a permanent manager since Howard Kendall’s ill-fated return to the club.  “Everton Football Club can confirm the departure of Rafael Benítez as First Team manager,” read a statement. “Benítez, who joined Everton in June 2021, has left the club with immediate effect. An update on a permanent replacement will be made in due course.” Everton fans unfurled banners at Carrow Road calling for Benítez to be sacked and they got their wish on Sunday, with the former Liverpool manager lasting just over six months of his three-year contract. Benítez became the most controversial managerial appointment in Everton’s history and only the second man to have managed both Everton and Liverpool after William Edward Barclay in the 19th century. He received personal abuse and threats before signing the contract in June 2021, and Merseyside police investigated a banner that warned “We know where you live” but was left outside the wrong house near the Spaniard’s family home in Wirral. Many Evertonians have not forgiven Benítez for the “small club” comment he made after a goalless Merseyside derby in 2007.

1/17/2022,"Paul Myners, the City grandee and former Labour minister brought in to government to tackle the 2008 financial crisis, has died at the age of 73. Regarded as an influential figure in both the square mile and politics for his time advising the former prime minister Gordon Brown on the historic bailout of the British banking system, Baron Myners, of Truro in the county of Cornwall, died in the early hours of this morning.  His family confirmed in a statement that Myners had “passed away peacefully” at Chelsea & Westminster hospital in London. Adopted from a Bath orphanage by a Cornish couple at the age of three, he started as an inner city school teacher, then became a financial journalist for the Daily Telegraph before moving into finance with the storied London investment bank NM Rothschild. Myners was chairman of the Guardian Media Group (GMG), publisher of the Guardian and Observer newspapers, between 2000 and 2008 when he stood down to take his ministerial post in Brown’s government as the global financial system was imploding. The former prime minister led tributes to Myners, describing him as a “tower of strength” during the crisis. “My thoughts are with Paul’s family,” said Brown. “After a successful career in finance [he] was persuaded in 2008 to enter public service and was a tower of strength, helping nationalise key banks and producing a plan to overcome the global financial crisis. His charitable work in his native Cornwall will be long remembered.” Barely 20 days into his role as City minister, Myners was thrown into the deep end to help orchestrate Brown’s bank rescue, which led to the taxpayer taking multibillion-pound stakes in Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group after its merger with HBOS. Carolyn McCall, the ITV chief executive who ran GMG while Myners was chairman, said he would be “greatly missed”. “Paul was formidable with a brilliant brain, an entrepreneurial spirit and a prodigious work ethic. He didn’t suffer fools at all, was a tough taskmaster and had a wicked sense of humour. I loved working with him and learned so much when he chaired GMG.” Earlier in his career, Myners had been chairman and previously chief executive of the City fund manager Gartmore, where he made his name in finance after growing the firm into a multibillion-pound investment house. Under his stewardship, its funds grew from £1.2bn in 1985 to £75bn in 2001. In 2000, he moved to positions as a non-executive director of several companies, including the chairmanship of Marks & Spencer during a tense period when the high street stalwart faced down a potential bid from the retailer Philip Green. Myners was also influential in compiling a landmark government review into institutional investment and chaired the Low Pay Commission. He entered the House of Lords in 2008 after being made a life peer, and remained on the Labour benches until 2014, when he became a crossbench peer. He was appointed chairman of of the UK arm of the international public relations firm Edelman in 2015. Myners is survived by his five children, and five grandchildren. In a statment, the family said: “With great sadness we announce the loss of our beloved father Lord Paul Myners (1948-2022). He passed away peacefully in the early hours of this morning (Sunday) at Chelsea & Westminster Hospital. He will be deeply missed and in our hearts forever.”",News/Business,"Paul Myners, ‘tower of strength’ in financial crisis, dies aged 73",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/16/paul-myners-tower-of-strength-in-financial-crisis-dies-aged-73
1/17/2022,"At every afterparty since 1988, at least one partygoer has fantasised about their friendship group growing old together in a rave retirement facility where they pipe mellow bangers through the intercom. Sesh pensioners, this is your ideal soundtrack. Since 2010’s breakthrough Black Sands, Bonobo’s Si Green has used what he calls “electronic methods to make non-electronic music” to richly satisfying effect, and Fragments is his peak production. As with the Cinematic Orchestra or Caribou, you settle into a Bonobo album or gig knowing roughly what the destination will be, yet never sure exactly how you’ll get there. Harps and strings are central to this year’s trip, but there’s ample space for skittery breaks, deep house and haunting choral samples.  Green usually finds singers who dovetail with his music, as with previous collaborators Erykah Badu and Nick Murphy. Here, the promising Jordan Rakei impresses on Shadows. Poet Jamila Woods brings Tides, the best song, a swooning beauty that expertly blurs its acoustic and electronic elements. With less dissonance and psychedelic experimentation than Jon Hopkins or Four Tet, Fragments may be too care-home comfort for some, but it’s brilliant, wondrous work.",Arts/Music,Bonobo: Fragments review – a wondrous nirvana,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/16/bonobo-fragments-review-a-wondrous-nirvana
1/17/2022,"Amazon’s UK website has told customers it will stop accepting payments made with UK-issued Visa credit cards from 19 January.  It says this decision is “due to the high fees Visa charges for processing credit card transactions”. Millions of people who use a Visa credit card to buy products on Amazon’s UK website and/or pay for their Amazon Prime membership are affected. Nevertheless, many will have already updated their payment details after the original announcement in November, and will now be using another card. Amazon said it would continue to accept all debit cards (including Visa debit cards) and non-Visa credit cards. There has been speculation that an agreement may still be reached between the two sides that means the payment ban is modified or scrapped. Some customers who have yet to update their payment details say that, after receiving several emails from Amazon urging them to take action, they have not received any further emails since Christmas – leading them to wonder if the Visa credit card ban might not happen after all. Some also report that when they log into their Amazon account, the urgent warnings to act that were there before seem to have been watered down or removed. The change does not apply to Amazon Business, the retailer’s physical stores or certain subsidiaries such as Audible. A Prime member who does not update their card details will not have the plug pulled immediately. When a Prime member’s payment is declined (most probably pay monthly), they have 30 days to provide a new eligible payment method or their membership will be cancelled. Many shoppers choose to use credit cards for large purchases online because of the extra protections offered if things go wrong. Under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, if a retailer goes out of business or fails to deliver goods as promised and the items cost more than £100, the credit card provider has an obligation to refund the costs. Amazon’s decision also deals a blow to people who use their Visa credit card to spread the cost of their spending, or to collect points, air miles or cashback. Meanwhile, some people are using a so-called “credit-builder” credit card to rebuild their credit history, perhaps after experiencing financial problems in the past. The move potentially leaves millions of credit card holders facing a dilemma. For example, Barclaycard is the UK’s biggest credit card company, and its credit cards only use the Visa network. An Amazon user who banks with Barclays and has a Barclaycard could decide to switch over to the bank’s debit card instead. But that will not suit some people financially – it means they will not benefit from what can be a cheap way of borrowing money for a short period, as well as other perks. If they do not wish to do that and do not own another credit card, their main option if they want to continue using Amazon would be to apply for a Mastercard credit card from another provider. Some may not wish to do this, or may be rejected. Some shoppers with concerns about the ethics of using Amazon may use the inconvenience caused by this week’s move – if it happens – as an opportunity to end their relationship with the online giant. For years campaigners have been urging shoppers to boycott Amazon over tax avoidance and other issues. To encourage affected Amazon users to update their payment method, Amazon has been offering some people up to £20 off their next purchase. To get this, they need to add a qualifying debit card, Mastercard or Amex card to their Amazon account.",News/Technology,What will happen if Amazon stops accepting UK-issued Visa credit cards?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/16/what-will-happen-if-amazon-stops-accepting-uk-issued-visa-credit-cards
1/17/2022,"Millions of people’s credit cards will stop working on Amazon’s UK website from this week – unless there is an 11th-hour resolution to a bitter dispute between the retailer and payments giant Visa. In November, Amazon told customers that from 19 January it would stop accepting payments made with UK-issued Visa credit cards, in what has been described as a “game of corporate chicken”.  It is not known how many people are affected by the payment ban, though in March 2021, Mintel said 89% of Britons shopped at Amazon, and its analysts estimated Amazon Prime membership in the UK at about 21 million. Last month it was claimed that Amazon faces losing nearly £1.4bn from UK shoppers as a result of its move. There is speculation, however, that a last-minute agreement could be reached between the two sides. On Friday, Amazon and Visa declined to provide an update on negotiations. Amazon blamed its decision on “the high fees Visa charges for processing credit card transactions”. The move potentially inconveniences millions of people who use a Visa credit card issued by providers including Barclaycard to buy items on the website or pay for their Amazon Prime membership. The retailer said it would continue to accept all debit cards (including Visa debit cards) and non-Visa credit cards, including Mastercard-branded ones and American Express. Affected customers who currently use a Visa credit card have been told they need to update their payment method, otherwise any new orders they place on the site will be rejected from 19 January onwards. They will also lose access to Amazon Prime benefits including faster delivery of items, thousands of TV shows and films on Prime Video, and the Amazon Music Prime streaming service. At the time of the announcement, Visa said it was “continuing to work toward a resolution,” while Martin Lewis, the founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, said he suspected the move was a possible negotiating tactic by Amazon to get Visa to lower its fees. To date there has been no news of any agreement, and on Thursday, a blog in trade journal the Grocer said this was a “game of corporate chicken” – a row where neither side wants to be the first to back down. Nevertheless, one credit card industry insider told the Guardian: “We are hopeful there will be an agreement.” In emails to customers, Amazon has acknowledged that removing the ability to pay for products with a Visa credit card and making people update their details may be inconvenient and “a bit of a bother”. Payments on cards attract a range of fees including interchange fees, which are paid by businesses to card issuers each time a card is used by a consumer, and are higher for credit card transactions. Card fees have long been an issue of contention between providers and retailers, and last week MPs waded into the row. The Commons Treasury select committee said that in October, a few weeks before Amazon’s announcement, both Mastercard and Visa hiked cross-border interchange fees for debit and credit card transactions, from 0.2% to 0.3% and from 1.15% to 1.5% respectively. It added that the fees paid by businesses to card payment operators for use of the service had also risen substantially. Visa said in November that it was “very disappointed that Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future”.

1/17/2022,"No arthouse cinema repertory programme in the 1980s was complete without regular screenings of the chic French thriller Diva (1981). The plot combined opera, murder and corruption, while the visual style had the sort of pizzazz more readily associated with advertising or pop videos. By the end of the same decade, the prospect of a student bedsit that did not have on its walls the poster for the erotic love story Betty Blue (1986) was as unthinkable as one without Pot Noodle and patchouli oil. Both films were directed by Jean-Jacques Beineix, who has died aged 75 after a long illness. Diva concerns Jules (Frédéric Andréi), a postal worker who makes an illegal bootleg tape of an American opera singer (Wilhelmenia Wiggins Fernandez) famous for refusing to allow her voice to be recorded. This cassette becomes mixed up with one containing testimony incriminating a high-ranking police officer, and soon Jules is being chased by cops and thugs alike.  Fernandez initially rejected the script, which Beineix had adapted with Jean Van Hamme from the novel by Daniel Odier, who published it under the pseudonym Delacorta. “I was reading murder, prostitution and drugs, and I wanted nothing to do with it,” she said in 1983. “Jean-Jacques forced me to read it with him. Then I realised it was actually light, like a Disney treatment of a Hitchcock film.” She was relatively unknown at the time, and the singer’s profile was boosted by her performance, which included a rendition of the aria Ebben? Ne andrò lontana from the opera La Wally. Diva heralded the arrival of a flashy mode of film-making later termed “cinéma du look”. Reaction to the movie from French critics, however, was hostile. “I thought I had made two films for the price of one,” the director said in 2009. “My first and my last.” His producers were reluctant to submit Diva to the Toronto film festival, fearing that international exposure would further harm the movie’s reputation. “What damage can we do to this picture?” asked Beineix. “We’re already dead!” Stepping off the plane in Toronto, he went straight to the cinema where he found a standing ovation underway. “I thought, ‘Something’s wrong. I’m in another dimension.’” The film was acclaimed by international critics. David Denby in New York magazine praised its “rapturous pop beauty” and likened Beineix to Steven Spielberg and Brian De Palma. Still playing in Paris after a year, Diva won four César awards, including the prize for best first film. The Moon in the Gutter (1983) was a textbook case of the sophomore slump. Adapted by the director and Olivier Mergault from the pulp novel by David Goodis, whose work had previously been filmed by François Truffaut and Sam Fuller, it was a grandiose affair which prioritised slick, post-modern artifice over actors (including Gérard Depardieu and Nastassja Kinski) and made only the feeblest connection with audiences. Critics scoffed, including Pauline Kael, who had found his debut “genuinely sparkling” but now declared its follow-up “excruciatingly silly.” After the response to Diva, which Beineix called a “wonderful dream, where I was flying on the wings of victory”, he experienced a sudden fall. “Bang, bang, bang: I’m shot down. It was very scary.” He recovered with Betty Blue, which he adapted from Philippe Dijan’s novel 37 °2 le matin, about Zorg (Jean-Hugues Anglade), a house-painter and aspiring novelist, and his passionate, volatile girlfriend. The gifted 21-year-old newcomer Béatrice Dalle beat Isabelle Adjani to the title role. This tale of amour fou opens with an extended sex scene filmed in one take and beginning in wide shot before gradually moving in closer onto the lovers. In the script, the scene had occurred 10 minutes into the movie but Beineix changed his mind in the editing room. “I realised: That’s the base of everything.” He regarded it as “a political statement” but Dalle complained that he had not insisted on a closed set during her nude scenes. “I still have a grudge with Beineix about that,” she said in 2013. “[The crew] all stayed there, like they were on the set of an X-rated movie. Appalling. Horrible.” Her untamed performance is the highlight of a film which also boasts luminous cinematography by Jean-François Robin. It was he who steered the colour scheme away from the refrigerated blues of Diva and The Moon in the Gutter by pointing out that this was “a sun and sweat story” which might benefit from resembling “Kodachrome slides shot by amateurs. Holiday snapshots, warm and sunny.” The film takes a rather ugly turn – Zorg’s literary prospects improve only once Betty is in a psychiatric institution, where he finally smothers her with a pillow. It had enough admirers, though, to earn Oscar, Bafta and Golden Globe nominations for best foreign language film, and to warrant the release five years later of a director’s cut extending the running time from two hours to three. Beineix was born in Paris, the son of Madeline (nee Maréchal) and Robert Beineix, an insurance salesman. He was educated at the Lycée Carnot and the Lycée Condorcet, both in Paris. He studied medicine, then quit to become an assistant director to film-makers such as Jean Becker, Claude Berri and Claude Zidi. He was second assistant director on Jerry Lewis’s controversial drama The Day the Clown Cried (1972), in which Lewis plays an entertainer leading Jewish children to the Nazi gas chambers; it has never been released, and Lewis stipulated that it cannot be shown until 2024. Beineix’s only directing credit prior to Diva was the short Le Chien de Monsieur Michel (1977). In the wake of his success with Diva, he was courted by US studios. “At first, Hollywood saw me as some kind of exotic puppet,” he said. A vampire comedy he wrote for Paramount was never made, a contract with the producer Edward R Pressman came to nought, and he declined offers to work as a hired hand. “The privilege of being a French director is that you are basically free to do what you want. The disaster is that you don’t understand that the rest of the world doesn’t work like this.” After Betty Blue, interest in his films began to wane outside France. Roselyne and the Lions (1989) was a meandering love story about a pair of circus workers. The whimsical IP5 (1992) featured Yves Montand’s final performance. Beineix moved into documentaries, among them Locked-In Syndrome (1997), which told the story of Jean-Dominique Bauby, who suffered a stroke which left him unable to communicate except by blinking one eyelid. Beineix turned down the invitation to make the dramatised version, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, which was directed in 2007 by Julian Schnabel. His last fiction film was Mortal Transfer (2001), a macabre farce starring Anglade as a psychoanalyst who must dispose of a patient’s body; Beineix ploughed $2m of his own money into the project. In 2004, he co-wrote the vampire-themed graphic novel L’Affaire Du Siècle; a second instalment arrived in 2006 along with his first volume of memoir, Les Chantiers de la Gloire, which ran to 835 pages. A novel, Toboggan, was published in 2020. Beineix described himself in 2006 as “arrogant, a provocateur. I must be a little bit in love with failure because I provoke it. It happens that when you are afraid to be loved, you inspire hostility. It’s perverse.” He is survived by his wife, Agnès, and daughter, Frida.
