2/14/2022,"Are we all doomed to live in Charlie Brooker’s techno-dystopia? In Metalhead, an episode from season four of his famed Netflix show Black Mirror, a woman navigates an austere post-apocalyptic landscape while running for her life from a murderous robot dog. What makes the mechanized beast in the show particularly frightening is the lethal combination of the single-mindedness of a computer program with the extreme ferocity of an angry, feral dog. But it’s just TV, right? Not exactly. The military, technological, security and political classes in this country appear united in their desire to make robot dogs part of our future, and we should all be worried.  The latest example came on 1 February, when the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a press release titled “Robot Dogs Take Another Step Towards Deployment at the Border”. DHS dressed up their statement with the kind of adorable language made to warm the hearts of dog lovers everywhere. “The Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) is offering US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) a helping hand (or ‘paw’),” read the release. Isn’t that cute? A picture of the “four-legged ground drone” accompanied the release, and the “Automated Ground Surveillance Vehicle”, as it’s called, looked remarkably (and scarily) similar to the monstrous quadrupeds seen in the Black Mirror episode. But let’s not judge based on appearance. The real issue is that we keep rushing to militarized and technological solutions to what ultimately are human and political questions, creating more problems along the way. These particular robot dogs are made by Ghost Robotics, which claims that its 100lb machine was “bred” to scale “all types of natural terrain including sand, rocks and hills, as well as human-built environments, like stairs”. Each robot dog is outfitted with a bevy of sensors and able to transmit real-time video and information feeds. The devices are not yet in operation on the US-Mexico border, but a testing and evaluation program is under way in El Paso, Texas. To listen to DHS, it all sounds so utterly charming and so very next-gen – until you realize that what we’re talking about is the further encroachment of government surveillance on our daily lives. As the Electronic Frontier Foundation notes, “people who live along the border are some of the most heavily surveilled people in the United States. A massive amalgamation of federal, state and local law enforcement and national security agencies are flying drones, putting up cameras and just generally attempting to negate civil liberties – capturing the general goings-on of people who live and work in proximity to the border.” Then there’s the question of lethal force. These specific ground drones may not be armed, but Ghost Robotics is already infamous for the combination of robot dog and robot rifle. In 2021, small arms manufacturer Sword International (must these companies choose such dystopian names?) outfitted a robot dog from Ghost Robotics with a custom-made weapon, called a “special purpose unmanned rifle” or Spur. This darling invention was unveiled at the annual conference of the Association of the United States Army. Incidentally, US policy not only does not “prohibit the development or employment” of killer robots (officially known as “lethal autonomous weapon systems,” or Laws) but also opposes any international preemptive ban. Meanwhile, as the Congressional Research Service notes, Israel has already exported what many consider a lethal autonomous weapon system to Chile, China, India, South Korea and Turkey. We’re fast running out of time for robust international dialogue on this issue. Domestically, the short history of the use of the robot dogs in our cities is also troubling. The Honolulu police department used about $150,000 of pandemic funding to buy their robot dog, which they then used to scan the eyes and take the temperatures of unhoused people to check for symptoms of Covid. The practice raised the alarms of advocates who said the practice was fundamentally dehumanizing. Needless to say, no housed person was treated that way. And after public outcry in 2021, the New York police department returned its $94,200 robot dog, Digidog. That robot was deployed to a home invasion in the Bronx and to a tense situation in a public housing building in Manhattan, attracting the angry notice of New Yorkers. Once again, many Black and brown New Yorkers felt over-policed, over-surveilled and under-resourced. “You can’t give me a living wage, you can’t raise a minimum wage, you can’t give me affordable housing; I’m working hard and I can’t get paid leave, I can’t get affordable childcare,” said Representative Jamaal Bowman in a video he posted to Twitter. “Instead we got money, taxpayer money, going to robot dogs?” Bowman is hardly alone. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez criticized both the NYPD’s robot dog in 2021 and the recent news of robot dogs at the border. “It’s shameful how both parties fight tooth + nail to defend their ability to pump endless public money into militarization,” she recently tweeted. “From tanks in police depts to corrupt military contracts, funding this violence is bipartisan + non-controversial, yet healthcare + housing isn’t. It’s BS.” She’s right, of course, as is Bowman. Where exactly are our priorities? The Biden administration has a chance to stop this program in its tracks before the border becomes even more of a militarized, technological dystopia. We’re so easily mesmerized by the massive capabilities of technology, but the fact is that techno-military solutions to human problems too often create more problems than they solve. Just ask the unhoused populations in Honolulu, the urban poor in New York, and – if the program’s not cancelled – asylum seekers on the border. These are the people whose daily realities are increasingly being militarized by this technology. And because they are vulnerable and without political clout, they’re the ones closest to living in a Black Mirror episode. Meanwhile, the rest of us are sold a hi-tech bill of goods that unites everything that Americans love – technology, dogs and guns – and told to believe it’s all for the best. Look, I love my tech and all it can do as much as the next person, but when our embrace of technology reduces rather than enhances our dignity, then we have a problem. Humans deserve better. And frankly, so do dogs – even robot ones.

2/14/2022,"Good morning. Europe is closer to war than at any point over the past 70 years, a UK government minister has warned, as Russian troops amass on the borders of Ukraine and western leaders warn that an invasion could take place early this week.  The armed forces minister James Heappey told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme he feared “we are closer than we’ve been on this continent” to war “for 70 years”. Western leaders are mounting a final effort to negotiate diplomatic solutions after US intelligence said an attack could be imminent. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will travel to Kyiv for talks with Ukrainian officials and British prime minister Boris Johnson said he would hold further talks with world leaders to bring Russia “back from the brink” of war. Is Joe Biden involved in the last minute negotiations? Yes but yesterday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, urged Joe Biden to visit Kyiv “in the coming days” in a show of moral support. However, the White House has made no mention of the invitation so it’s unclear if Biden intends to go. Is time running out to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis? US intelligence over the weekend claimed that Russia had accelerated plans for an invasion and could move troops across the border as soon as Wednesday, before the end of the Winter Olympics on 20 February. The key Ambassador Bridge trade link between Canada and the US has reopened after police cleared the last Covid restriction protesters, ending a six-day blockade. Police moved in to clear and arrest the remaining protesters on the border bridge yesterday, trying to end one of the main demonstrations that have broken out across Canada against Covid-19 vaccine mandates and other restrictions to bring the pandemic under control. After issuing warnings, police said arrests would be made and vehicles towed just after dawn near the bridge linking Detroit and the city of Windsor, Ontario. By Sunday afternoon, most protesters had gone and vehicles that were blocking the way had been removed, and the bridge reopened just before midnight on Sunday. What about the protests in Ottawa? Small-scale protests there swelled to what police said were 4,000 demonstrators. The city has seen that on past weekends, and loud music played as people milled about downtown where anti-vaccine demonstrators have been encamped since late January. Kamila Valieva, the 15-year-old Russian skater who charmed these Winter Olympics before her positive drugs test sent shockwaves across the world, has sensationally been cleared to compete in the individual event due to the “exceptional circumstances” of her case. The court of arbitration for sport, which delivered its verdict yesterday, said that banning Valieva while her doping case was ongoing “would cause her irreparable harm”. The three-person panel also ruled that the World Anti-Doping Code was unclear when it came to suspended “protected persons” under 16 years of age and said that a 44-day delay in reporting Valieva’s positive test for the banned angina drug trimetazidine had affected her ability to mount a defence. “The panel considered that preventing the athlete from competing at the Olympic Games would cause her irreparable harm in these circumstances,” Matthieu Reeb, secretary general for the court of arbitration for sport, told the world’s press. Does everyone agree with the decision? No. Sarah Hirshland, the president of the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee said she was “disappointed” by the decision. “This appears to be another chapter in the systemic and pervasive disregard for clean sport by Russia,” she added. Six years after the Los Angeles Rams returned to California – after a 20-year sojourn in St Louis – the Rams are Super Bowl champions for the second time in their history. They have been accused of trading away their future to build a team of superstars, but their fans are unlikely to care now. And here Sam Wolfson reviews the half-time show by Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg, Eminem, Kendrick Lamar and Mary J Blige. Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, has said an “onslaught” of Covid-19 infections has dealt a heavy blow and overwhelmed capacity as daily cases surge to record highs. Daily infections have multiplied by a factor of 13 over the past two weeks, with authorities scrambling to control the deepening outbreak. Donald Trump has endorsed rightwing Republican candidates who support his baseless claims of a stolen election for key posts in Michigan, raising the prospect of a Trumpist take over of how the key battleground state might run its elections. Some players of the viral word game Wordle have complained that it has become harder since it was bought by the New York Times late last month. The New York Times has denied any changes have been made to Wordle since the acquisition. “Nothing has changed about the game play,” they said. After that initial attraction, what keeps a couple together? And as we change and grow over the years, how do we make sure we move in the same direction? Six relationship experts on how to keep that loving feeling. Philippa Perry suggests remembering your partner is not responsible for your happiness, you are. “I don’t recommend entering a relationship believing love will conquer your personal demons and, then, when it doesn’t, blaming your partner for you not feeling happier.” Dogs are not the only pets vulnerable to heatstroke, and experts are saying that people should be aware of the risk to smaller animals such as guinea pigs and rabbits, especially as global temperatures rise. Researchers say their findings highlight the need for better public awareness of heatstroke and the risk to all animals, and that cases will continue to rise with warmer weather because of the climate emergency. The mountain lion known as P22 has become something of a celebrity in the city of Los Angeles. The big cat resides in Griffith Park, a 4,000-acre park tucked in the Hollywood hills, and has inspired murals, songs and even an exhibit about his life. Beth Pratt, California director for the National Wildlife Federation, has a tattoo of P22 and dubbed him the “Brad Pitt of mountain lions” – attractive, enigmatic and unlucky in love. He has plenty of deer to eat, no male competitors in his territory, but also no hope of finding a mate. First Thing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

2/14/2022,"Police are hunting for a “dangerous sex offender” who escaped from prison and presents a particular danger to women and children. Paul Robson, who is serving a life sentence for attempted rape and indecent assault, absconded from an open prison in Lincolnshire on Sunday.  Robson was jailed at Oxford crown court in 2000 after he entered a woman’s home through a cat flap before tying her up, putting a pillowcase over her head and brutally assaulting her while holding a knife to her throat. Lincolnshire police urged people not to approach the 56-year-old, saying he “can cause real harm to anyone he comes across”, adding he could have travelled abroad. DCS Andy Cox said: “He could be anywhere in the country, and we are really keen to hear from the public with potential sightings so we can take this man off our streets. “Robson is a dangerous sex offender and while he presents a particular danger to women and young children, I believe he can cause real harm to anyone he comes across. Since reports of his escape came to light, we have deployed additional resources to apprehend Robson.” After his conviction, the sentencing judge described Robson as a “menace to females”. He had been released from prison only three weeks before the attack and was on licence. He was reported missing from HMP North Sea Camp in Boston at about 7am on Sunday, Lincolnshire police said He is described as a white male with a bald head and a long goatee beard and is of slim build. “We are still working tirelessly to locate Paul Robson and are still working through numerous lines of inquiry,” Cox said. “If you see Robson, please do not approach him, and do not try to apprehend him yourself. Call 999 immediately. We are really grateful for all the shares so far and rest assured we will continue our efforts to find and arrest him.” Police have urged anyone with information or confirmed sightings of Robson to call 999.",News/UK news,Lincolnshire police hunt for escaped ‘dangerous sex offender’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/14/lincolnshire-police-hunt-for-escaped-dangerous-sex-offender
2/14/2022,"Two sorts of rain today. One is bouncing off the brown terrace tiles, and giving them a clean, at least. The other is of polenta, raining down into a pan of boiling water. I’d planned a downpour of instant polenta, but then it went dark and the sky opened, so standing by a warm cooker, stirring and listening to the radio, was suddenly a good idea. Also, I’m convinced that the option of instant – be that polenta, custard, chocolate pudding, coffee or tan – makes the long version more appealing, because it is a choice. In Elena Previde Massara’s Il Grande Libro della Polenta, there is a line illustration in which Italy’s lower half is a familiar boot, but then midway up becomes a cob of maize that mimics the shape of the country and reveals the kernels, ready to be dried and ground into polenta. A half-corn Italy, though, only began in the 16th century, when maize was introduced to Europe from Mesoamerica, where it is thought to have been celebrated, harvested, ground and eaten as early as 10,000 years ago. The word polenta is ancient, deriving from the Latin polĕnta, which means something made of pollen, or “fine flour”, and cooked into a mush, or puls as it was known in ancient Rome, and made from barley, farro, chickpeas or chestnuts.  Previde explains that there is some debate and document-waving by both the Friulani and Bergamaschi over who first cultivated maize and ground it into puls/polenta. What is certain is that it became a sustenance food, surrounded by ritual, folklore and wonderful recipes. Traditionalists insist that polenta requires slow cooking, ideally in a copper pan, with constant stirring for at least an hour and up to three, and sometimes even four. The science behind this is starch gelatinisation, the process by which, thanks to heat, water and stirring, the tightly bound starch molecules within each grain loosen and swell, becoming digestible, and giving off a starchy gel that brings everything together. It is also during long cooking that flavour is developed. Harold McGee is right that cooks can develop just as much flavour with less labour by partly covering a pot of just-thickened polenta, putting it into a low oven (130C/250F/gas ½), which heats the bottom and sides in a controlled, even way, and stirring only occasionally. And then there is instant polenta, made with polenta that has been pre-cooked, usually with steam, dried and ground to a fine powder. This process means its absorption is completely different from proper polenta, and it cooks in a fraction of the time. I think instant polenta is best when it is left to set, then cut into slices and brought back to life in a frying pan. And long-cooked polenta is wonderful, especially when you learn that you don’t need to stand still and stir constantly. Two sorts of rain, and two ways to serve the polenta. One is simply more grated parmesan or cubed fontina, the other is a mound of green, which I crave at the moment – broccoletti, cavolo nero or sprouting broccoli (let’s say 500g), trimmed accordingly, boiled in well-salted boiling water until tender, then tossed in gently warmed olive oil, a clove of minced garlic and a good pinch of red chilli flakes. And, for pudding, I suggest instant chocolate pudding. Prep 10 minCook 50 min (or about 15 min if using instant polenta)Serves 4 Salt300g polenta (or instant polenta)500g broccoletti, cavolo nero or sprouting broccoli, trimmed accordinglyOlive oil1 garlic clove, peeled and mincedRed chilli flakes, to taste1 big slice of butter4 tbsp grated parmesan In a medium saucepan or deep saute pan, ideally copper or with a heavy base, heat 1.1 litres water until boiling, add salt, stir and reduce to a lively simmer. Slowly “rain” the polenta into the pan, whisking as you do, to prevent clumps. Once the polenta is incorporated, swap the whisk for a wooden spoon and stir. If you are using instant polenta, follow the packet instructions; otherwise, cook, stirring very regularly, for 45 minutes, or until the polenta is thick (but not stiff; if that is the case, add more hot water), pulling away from the sides of the pan and cooked through. Meanwhile, immerse the broccoletti, cavolo nero or sprouting broccoli in well salted boiling water, cook for five or so minutes, until tender, then drain. In a frying pan, gently warm some olive oil and add the garlic and chilli flakes. Once fragrant, add the broccoli and a pinch of salt, and turn in the oil. Stir the butter and half the parmesan into the polenta, turn it out on to a large dish, and top with the greens and remaining parmesan. Serve immediately.

2/14/2022,"“This is Not for Clients”, proclaims the title of a two-screen video installation. The significance of these words soon becomes clear as two nine-minute films – one silent – simultaneously unspool the story of a sex worker’s journey from “princess” to “dominatrix” to “low cost”. The camera drifts around a candy-coloured virtual sex dungeon as a voiceover explains: “High volume, low price, in order to survive. I have passed for ever to the side of the a-normals, of the crazy, of the misfits. Only we know when we survive, dirty with their opinions.” You can see why clients would not want to prick their consciences with this glimpse behind the scenes of their erotic fantasies. Letizia Miro, who wrote the text and performs in the film’s framing scenes, caters for such clients in her other life as an “unconventional libertine”. A London-based Catalan writer, poet and philosophy PhD, Miro quotes Virginia Woolf and the poet and novelist Ocean Vuong on her glossy website, which advertises her services as a fantasy girlfriend, “kinky companion” and “sensuality coach”.  When we meet via Zoom, Miro explains: “The website is client-facing, which means it doesn’t expose the complexities and darkness. Talking about precariousness is not sexy. My brand is very positive, but that doesn’t mean it’s not true. I’m a positive, empowered woman but I’m also struggling like everyone else to feel alive and to be financially independent in a capitalist system I did not choose.” The work is a collaboration with Yarli Allison and the two are among 13 international artists who were selected from 90 respondents to an open call submissions for the polemical exhibition about sex work, which opens this week at the ICA in London. From moving image to sculpture, from gaming to comics and embroidery, Decriminalised Futures sets out to explore the many facets of the world’s oldest industry, while making a case for it to be fully decriminalised. Technically, Allison points out, simply by collaborating on a sex work-related subject, she and Miro could fall foul of the UK’s sex trafficking laws. “Even as a videographer,” she says, “I could get in trouble, right? Because I’m in the same room – and no two women are allowed to be in the same room.” Miro adds: “It’s insane, because it forces women to work alone in unsafe situations – if there’s a bad client, you can’t go to the police.” The exhibition was the brainchild of curators Elio Sea and Yves Sanglante, and grew out of a weekend conference in 2019 celebrating the 10th anniversary of Swarm (the Sex Worker Advocacy and Resistance Movement) . “There’s a lot of political organising around sex worker rights, and creative stuff, so we thought it would be great to create a space for it that was wider,” says Sea, who comes to the project from a background in community advocacy, while Sanglante’s expertise is archiving and curating. “We know, from sex workers, that their lives are complex,” adds Sanglante. “Sex worker rights are a key intersection point of disability and healthcare, migration and borders, gender and work. We felt an exhibition might be a way to show that complexity.” Although the exhibition has yet to be fully installed – it will take over two storeys of the ICA, which sits in a grand 19th-century terrace just down the road from Buckingham Palace – there is beauty in the pieces that are viewable in advance. London-based Hanecdote uses fine embroidery to depict a sex worker’s dressing table: to one side of the clutter of makeup, masks and sex toys is a pile of books with such titles as Action, Safety, Community. Khaleb Brooks, a Chicago-born artist who has a residency at Liverpool’s International Slavery Museum, has made three arresting lifesize self-portraits in linocut, depicting themself before, during and after a sex session. The artists, who were selected by an independent panel, did not have to disclose whether they were involved with sex work. “In the public view,” says Sea, “there’s often this conflict. Either you say you’re a sex worker and people think, ‘Oh, you’re a victim, your voice can’t be trusted.’ Or you say you’re not a sex worker, then people tell you, ‘Oh, you don’t know what you’re talking about. You’re not an authentic voice.’” For Miro and Allison, as for many, the boundaries are blurred anyway. While Miro created the “semi-fictional documentary” of This Is Not for Clients, Allison was responsible for the filming and the surrounding installation, which will fill a whole room. Her bright, freeform graphics make the whips and manacles of a BDSM dungeon look like soft-play toys. From Hong Kong, though born in Canada and now based in Paris, she came to the project via an interest in east Asian and queer porn. “At the beginning,” she says, “I thought gay porn is porn and my art is my art – I saw them as separate. But now I realise that making queer porn, and queer tattooing in queer spaces, is just as consensual as any other artwork in my practice”. It was a tattoo that brought the two together. Miro holds her arm up to show an image, made by Allison, of a woman emerging from a box. “That’s me getting out of my PhD,” she says. She has published her writing under several different names and would love to bring them all together in an anthology one day, but has not yet dared to do so for fear of losing both her work and her family. Because of the particular interests of the selection panel – which included artists, film-makers, writers and curators – the exhibition is dominated by artists who operate in a queer space. Among them is Aisha Mirza, a DJ, stripper and columnist for Gal-dem magazine, who recently featured in a British Vogue profile of three gender non-confoming trendsetters. Mirza, who is bipolar, describes their installation – the best dick i ever had was a thumb & good intentions – as a meditation on the intersection of pleasure and sacred spaces with mental health and selfhood: “I got involved in the exhibition by answering the callout. I was working as a stripper at LGBTQ club Harpies at the time, and had a lot of thoughts and feelings about that experience, so it seemed like a good match.” Mirza, who lives on a houseboat in east London, has worked as a dominatrix. “With chronic mental health difficulties, sex work has seemed more appealing and attainable than many other jobs. If I can make three months’ rent kicking a man in the balls for 30 minutes, why wouldn’t I? Due to my privileges and safety nets, I’m able to choose what jobs I want to do. I’m able to have firm boundaries around what’s comfortable for me. This is not the norm.” Mirza is referring to the dark side of a global industry that exploits and traffics vulnerable people. The exhibition doesn’t shy away from this, its curators say. “There’s an understanding of what it means to be exploited,” says Sea, “But there’s a cultural preoccupation with talking about trafficking as soon as we talk about sex work, when trafficking is a form of exploitation that can be found at high levels in many sectors, including agriculture, domestic work and construction. There was a report just the other day about the levels of trafficking within farming and domestic labour.” Mirza is more militant. “As we know, sex work is the oldest profession. It needs to be respected, and brought out of the shadows for the safety of people engaging in it. It’s beyond disgusting that politicians and bankers make decisions every day that endanger and harm poorer and marginalised people – while also using the services of sex workers. Yet they are respected and rewarded, while sex workers are reviled and considered sub-human, not even worthy of basic rights and protection. I want the moral hysteria around sex work to die because it is so boring and hypocritical and dangerous that it hurts.” Mirrors are a recurrent motif through the artworks, whether at the centre of Hanecdote’s exquisitely embroidered dressing table, or on the walls of Miro and Allison’s dungeon. Mirza – who uses a large ornate one to lure people into viewing themselves alongside a collection of objects personal to the artist, from zines and meds to a “bedazzled dildo” – sums up this preoccupation with the two-way gaze. “I wanted people to see themselves, in both a ‘You’re welcome’ and a ‘You’re implicated’ kind of way.” Dirty opinions will have to be parked outside the door.

2/14/2022,"One word is too often profanedFor me to profane it,One feeling too falsely disdainedFor thee to disdain it;One hope is too like despairFor prudence to smother,And pity from thee more dearThan that from another.  I can give not what men call love,But wilt thou accept notThe worship the heart lifts aboveAnd the Heavens reject not,—The desire of the moth for the star,Of the night for the morrow,The devotion to something afarFrom the sphere of our sorrow? To … is associated with the group of poems Shelley dedicated to Jane Williams in 1822, and it remains among the most lastingly popular and frequently anthologised of English love poems. It was one of the first Shelley poems I encountered, and since this week’s feauture is publishing on Valentine’s Day, it seemed auspiciousto revisit a literary “old flame” and see if it still burns as brightly. A little biographical context is unavoidable. The poet and his wife, Mary Shelley, were close friends with Jane and her husband, Edward, and the two families eventually shared a small house in Italy, on the coast of Lerici. Both Edward and Shelley lost their lives in a sailing accident in the summer of 1822. Like a knightly adherent of the Courtly love tradition, Shelley constructs a vow of chaste devotion in this poem, but makes demands beyond the genre in his plea to receive “pity” rather than submit to “disdain”. Jane’s participation in the fantasy romance is required, and there’s a faintly overbearing quality in the paired patterning of the lover’s statements and the woman’s imagined and wished-for responses. The poem is beautifully made. Its flexible, songlike rhythm and verbal formality combine in two stanzas of considerable eloquence and elegance. While the play of anapaests brings a lightness to the metre, the pattern of three and two-beat lines with, respectively, masculine and feminine endings, asserts a control of the medium equal to the emotional control proclaimed. In the first stanza, the sentence-subjects are not quite antithetical and their connection is emphasised by parallel grammatical structures. The subjects are “word” and “feeling”, “hope”, “prudence” and “pity”. The word which is “too often profaned” is carefully withheld, and then disclosed in the opening of the second stanza, “I can give not what men call love …” It’s a strange line, suggesting inadequacy rather than moral restraint, while loftily asserting the superiority of the love that remains physically unexpressed. Those negatives forming the first and third line-endings in the second stanza seem to add a touch of coercion to the argument. Shelley’s atheism doesn’t preclude a reference to the Heavens, and the certainty that his love would find approval there. No doubt these Heavens belong to the classical rather than Christian tradition. As a young reader, I particularly admired the comparison of the poet’s love with “[t]he desire of the moth for the star”. Now, it seems to strike a hyperbolic note, and yet the images it conjures are oddly affecting. The closing lines seem a humbler, plainer and more moving suggestion of the poet’s unhappiness than achieved elsewhere. Overall, the poem is a revealing expression of the pathology of “what men call love”. It’s more complicated than I first thought, and less dependent on the Romantic tradition in which it’s conventionally placed.",Arts/Books,Poem of the week: To … by Percy Bysshe Shelley,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/14/poem-of-the-week-to-by-percy-bysshe-shelley
2/14/2022,"Midway through Pankaj Mishra’s first novel in 20 years, Run and Hide, the narrator, Arun, predicts something drastic. “The new India will never make it,” he thinks, on a long cab ride from New Delhi to the Himalayas. Arun has just abandoned his girlfriend, Alia, in London and returned to India for the first time since his mother’s funeral. A close friend of Arun’s died by suicide in an American prison not too long ago; another friend is about to make a creepy move on Alia. And yet Arun is beleaguered more by his country’s prospects than his breakup or loss. You don’t have to agree with his opinion of “new India” to realise that his prognosis is superfluous to the story. Ever since his debut novel, The Romantics, was published in 1999, Mishra has established himself as a prognosticating pundit of sorts. His essays have scrupulously documented the dark underside of India’s economic growth: the widening rift between the country’s nouveau riche and the millions who struggle to make ends meet; the decades of military occupation of Kashmir; the reverberatory ascent of Hindu nationalism. In 2017 he published Age of Anger, an ambitious polemic that traced the rise of Modi, Erdogan and Trump to older ideas of discontent with western modernity. Even in the 18th and 19th centuries, Mishra wrote, “the sense of being humiliated by arrogant and deceptive elites was widespread, cutting across national, religious and racial lines”.  Run and Hide puts this provocative theory into practice. In the opening pages, when we’re told that Arun and his friends are “self-made men of… lowly social backgrounds”, we’re already being primed to expect a cautionary tale about our unequal world. Aseem is a novelist and a media personality who is perceived as a hero of “petit-bourgeois aspirations” in India. Virendra was born a Dalit, the lowest Hindu caste, once called “untouchables”, but becomes a Wall Street billionaire within a few years. Arun’s father is cartoonishly evil, at once a wife beater, a rioter, a philanderer, a foul-mouthed swindler, and a “libtard-obsessed” supporter of Modi. Arun is the only character allowed some degree of complexity. A part-time translator living in the Himalayan foothills with his mother, he is alone among his cohort in his reluctance to pursue a lucrative career. He rejects the idea of moving to the west with a plaintive remark: “How much further do I have to go for a bit of dignity?” In Arun, the Buddhist desire to withdraw from the world coexists with a sterile self-absorption, which makes for a fascinating case study, but a wearisome narrator. The novel is robbed of a necessary frisson, what Henry James once called “an immense and exquisite correspondence with life”. There is much to be admired about Mishra’s willingness to tackle one of contemporary fiction’s ignored themes: class. But his social – and, frankly, moral – indictments come at the expense of a novel’s inherent imaginative promise. It isn’t just the tediously flat characters; the plot, too, is an assortment of soapbox staples, be it the rags-to-riches story of Arun’s friends, or his own poor-boy-meets-rich-girl trajectory. Women are no more than props in this sweeping inventory of male self-aggrandisement. Arun’s mother is stereotypically submissive: always “working, knitting, when not cooking or cleaning”. Alia, too, is thinly drawn, apparently doomed to vapidness by her well-off upbringing, and later, for posting selfies on social media. The didacticism of Mishra’s essays, bracing in their clarity, works against him in fiction. Arun may be approaching 50, but his misgivings about Alia are the stuff of teenage pop lyrics: “you belonged to a world that could never quite be mine”. The reader is never quite immersed in a credible fictional landscape, because some character is speechifying on every other page about the crisis of liberal democracy or the “unfolding calamity” in India. Mishra doesn’t seem to realise the difference between the illuminating and the trivial detail, what to include and what to leave out. It is one thing to mock the pretensions of a newly wealthy middle class blinded by their own appetites, quite another to repeatedly drive home the point that everything about the rich is fraudulent, down to their “fake fingernails”. Scenes are introduced as “agonisingly vivid” before being laid out, objects are overwhelmingly catalogued as “emblems” before being described. The novel exudes a constant anxiety about being understood: Mishra doesn’t trust the reader to read between the lines. Twenty years ago, Mishra famously criticised one of Salman Rushdie’s novels, The Ground Beneath Her Feet, for merely echoing “the white noise of the modern world”. Now Mishra has himself produced a bristly saga, cloying in its concerns, tailored to appeal to those who, following the literary theorist Fredric Jameson’s edict, breathlessly consume novels from the global south as national allegories. You’ll find in this book a meticulous exposition of India’s illiberal turn, how the country’s pluralist and quasi-socialist founding principles were betrayed in the past three decades. But the story lacks a subtler feeling for life.  Run and Hide by Pankaj Mishra is published by Cornerstone (£16.99). To support the Guardian and Observer order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.
