3/2/2022,"The economic problem list for Russian President Vladimir Putin is piling up, says big name investor Ed Hyman. Evercore ISI's closely followed chairman revealed seven key issues now facing Putin's economy in a new note Tuesday afternoon: ""The Ruble has plunged."" ""The plunge in the ruble could push inflation to over 20%+"" ""The stock market has plunged."" ""The policy rate is up to 20%."" ""Unprecedented economic sanctions are being applied."" ""Foreign companies are shutting down their Russian operations ""Russia is being cut off from the rest of the world."" To be sure, it's getting ugly for Russia in light of its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Well-known Western multinationals such as Mastercard, Visa, HP and BlackRock have sought to distance themselves from doing business in Russia. Yahoo Finance has an exhaustive list of companies pulling away from Russia. The maneuvers come as the West blocked ""selected"" Russian banks from the SWIFT payment system. The decision essentially denies Russia access to financial markets globally and opens its economy up to a potentially severe decline. The economic situation in Russia has turned so rapidly that JPMorgan strategists tell Yahoo Finance the country is ""uninvestable."" Global asset markets continue to reflect the yawning uncertainty around how the invasion will end and the long-term economic fallout. The S&P 500 tumbled 1.55% to 4,306.26 at the close Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 1.76% to 33,292.95. The Nasdaq Composite also dropped 1.59% to 13,532.46. Losses also hit the 10-year U.S. Treasury index slid to 1.7%. Meanwhile, Brent crude oil prices traded above $100 a barrel. ""I think given what is going on in Russia and Ukraine, especially with the weaponization of money that the Western world has decided to at least initially combat that with I think that has led to a flight into safe-havens inclusive of Treasuries. I think a lot of that buying is because of the uncertainty with regard to Russia,"" explained Charles Schwab chief investment strategist Liz Ann Sonders on Yahoo Finance Live. One winner this week has been bitcoin, suddenly viewed as a safe haven, reports Yahoo Finance's crypto reporter David Hollerith. Bitcoin prices traded up 7% Tuesday afternoon to about $44,000.

3/2/2022,"AMC (AMC) Entertainment posted its ""strongest quarterly results in two full years,"" the company reported in its fourth-quarter earnings release. AMC stock was little changed following the print. Investors had some idea of what to expect since the theater chain posted some of its preliminary numbers last month. These are the results posted by the company, compared to consensus estimates, as compiled by Bloomberg data: Adjusted (loss) per share: -11 cents vs -16 cents estimated Total Revenue: $1.17 billion versus $1.16 billion expected The company's consolidated attendance clocked in at 59.68 million guests, a massive increase from the 8.09 million moviegoers for the same period last year. AMC highlighted a ""robust and appealing film slate that culminated with the exclusive theatrical release of the now third-highest grossing movie of all-time, ""Spiderman: No way home."" “AMC’s fourth quarter 2021 results represent our strongest quarter in two full years, with positive Adjusted EBITDA of almost $160 million, Operating Cash Generated of more than $220 million and finishing 2021 with a record year-ending liquidity position of more than $1.8 billion,"" Adam Aron, Chairman and CEO of AMC Entertainment said in the company's quarterly release. ""Our positive recovery glide path from the global pandemic continued in earnest in the fourth quarter. While not yet where we want to be, our progress is substantial and unmistakable,"" he added. AMC was a retail trader favorite last year — and among Yahoo Finance’s top three most searched tickers in 2021. It's been a volatile start of the year for so-called meme stocks like AMC and GameStop (GME). Shares of the theater chain gained more than 10% in February after a rough January. Year-to-date AMC is down more than 30%. Aron has leaned into retail enthusiasm. The company has expanded into non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Last year it announced the creation of shareholder NFTs and revealed crypto payments offerings. In early February AMC announced preliminary 4th quarter revenue of about $1.17 billion and adjusted EBITDA between $146.8 million and $151.8 million. Those preliminary figures beat Wall Street estimates. Shares rallied on the initial release. “What was really impressive was the operating leverage. They had margins of 13%. On the third-quarter call, they said that EBITDA in this kind of scenario where revenues could be essentially what they were, would be break even,” said Macquarie analyst Chad Beynon following the preliminary release. Beynon has an Underperform rating on the stock, and a $6 price target. The stock has 3 Hold, and 5 Sell recommendations from Wall Street analysts, with an average price target of $6.34 per share.

3/2/2022,"A good buying opportunity into a stock market well off its highs has taken shape, argues BlackRock Investment Institute Global Chief Investment Strategist Wei Li and her team. The rationale: the escalating situation between Russia and the West will likely mean a slower pace of interest rate hikes from global central banks. ""We see fast-rising energy prices exacerbating supply-driven inflation, both delaying and raising its peak. We think central banks will need to normalize policy to pre-Covid settings, and that they will find it tough to respond to any slowdown in growth. In other words, policy rates are headed higher. Yet central banks may face less political pressure to contain inflation as the conflict becomes an easy culprit for higher prices. We believe this will allow them to move more cautiously as they raise rates, especially the ECB. Our conclusion: The invasion has reduced the biggest risk to our investment thesis – policymakers slamming on the brakes or markets thinking they will,"" said the BlackRock team in a new note on Monday. The strategy group subsequently ""tactically"" upgraded its view on stocks while downgrading credit. To be sure, investors continue to voice their concerns on both the outlooks for inflation, interest rates and the Russia/Ukraine crisis. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) tanked more than 300 points today as the West slapped Russian banks with severe sanctions. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) were also in the red by early afternoon. Travel stocks such as Delta (DAL), JetBlue (JBLU) and Hilton (HLT) were hit on the unfavorable news flow, too. Brent crude oil popped 5% to above $102 a barrel amid fears of Russia retaliating by curtailing its energy production to the rest of the world. But as market pros often say, ""It takes two to make a market."" And while a money managing giant like BlackRock sees a buying opportunity for stocks here, PIMCO is taking a touch more defensive stance. ""We have taken down risk slightly. That is really just to take some chips off the table, to be be patient and wait for better entry points. I do think the market is starting to look more attractive,"" said PIMCO Portfolio Manager Erin Browne on Yahoo Finance Live. ""I want to be patient and wait for the dust to settle, wait for more clarity with regard to Russia, and then we will start to nibble back into the market.""
