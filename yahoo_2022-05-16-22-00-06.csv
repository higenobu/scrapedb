5/16/2022,"A U.S. Coast Guard vessel patrolling North Carolina’s Pamlico Sound found a dog paddling in the middle of nowhere Saturday, May 14. The rescue was nothing short of miraculous, given a lone dog is tough to spot in a body of water that is nearly 100 miles long and 25 miles wide in places. Coast Guard officials say the crew had been alerted that a boater “lost their dog Myla overboard in Pamlico Sound,” so the odd sight didn’t come as a complete shock. “Shortly after, look outs ... spotted movement on the calm waters and upon closer inspection saw a dog swimming towards the boat,” the Coast Guard reported. “The crew made way towards the distressed dog and hauled Myla on board. After a quick inspection to ensure no injuries, the exhausted pup was given VIP treatment by the crew and was eventually reunited with its owners.” Details of how long Myla had been in the water were not released. Video shows the dog was wide-eyed and likely in a state of panic when she reached the side of a Coast Guard vessel based out of Hatteras Inlet. It took two guardsmen to pull her aboard, and photos show she was eventually surrounded by crewmen who showered the dog with attention. “We want to congratulate Myla on being a good girl and an amazing doggie swimmer!” the Coast Guard wrote. The video, posted May 15 on Facebook, had been viewed 139,000 times and gotten more than 1,800 reactions and comments as of May 18. Many called the dog “amazing” for its endurance. “An incredible rescue of an outstanding fur baby,” Barb Drexler wrote on Facebook. Pamlico Sound is “the largest embayed estuary in the world,” according to The Albemarle-Pamlico National Estuary Partnership. “The sound is nearly 100 miles from north to south and more than 25 miles wide in some places,” the partnership says. “Indeed, early European explorers searching for a shortcut to the Orient mistook the immense body of water for the Pacific Ocean.” 4-pound dog found on Florida beach had traveled nearly 70 miles in 3 months, cops say Dog breaks hearts while patiently waiting for return of owner who died in New Jersey Meet ‘world’s oldest dog,’ a Florida chihuahua with same name as country music star",U.S./Raleigh News and Observer,Coast Guard stumbles onto dog swimming across vast Pamlico Sound off North Carolina,https://news.yahoo.com/coast-guard-stumbles-onto-dog-120041684.html
5/16/2022,"Books will be written about Russia's failures in Ukraine, and Ukraine's unexpectedly strong resistance in the face of an invasion by its much larger, better armed, and more powerful neighbor. Russian President Vladimir Putin's Feb. 24 lightning strike to capture Kyiv, the capital, was grounded, then retracted. And Russia's backup plan, redeploying its attrited forces to seize more territory in Ukraine's east and south, is by all accounts going haltingly and may not succeed, either. Ukraine is humiliating the Kremlin — killing its generals, sinking its battleships, destroying its tanks and aircraft, even pushing back Russian advances — but it isn't winning. Russia has killed thousands of Ukrainian civilians and soldiers, flattened major cities and small towns, caused Ukraine's economy to shrink a projected 30 percent this year, and taken a big swath of Ukraine's territory. And Russia may yet meet some of its redefined military objectives in Ukraine. But Moscow's mighty army, previously thought to be the second-most-powerful in the world, is losing right now. What's going on? ""The reality,"" Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told the Senate this week, is that ""Putin faces a mismatch between his ambitions and Russia's current conventional military capabilities."" Russia's original war aim ""was to inflict a decisive blow on Ukraine that would transform the country's political institutions,"" Zack Beauchamp writes at Vox. Putin's retreat from Kyiv and the rest of northern Ukraine ""de facto conceded that its fundamental war aim was outside of its power."" Yes, ""the Russian special military operation in Ukraine is already a strategic failure,"" says Olga Oliker at the International Crisis Group. ""What they wanted out of this was a compliant Ukraine run by people friendly to Russia. This does not seem like a plausible outcome — and, aside from that, their forces have proven to be much less capable than almost everyone thought."" What we're seeing with Russia, a senior Pentagon official assessed in mid-March, ""is poor planning running up against actual execution."" When Russia launched its invasion, it tried to quickly seize Kyiv and other major population centers, assuming there would be ""light Ukrainian resistance, which did not end up being the case,"" Vox's Beauchamp writes, ""and they were undercut by poor logistics and a decision to travel on open roads that created easy opportunities for ambushes. The Ukrainians took advantage, raiding Russia's weak supply lines and stymieing the Russians in brutal block-to-block fighting"" and savage drone attacks on Russian armor. Early footage and news reports showed ""Russia's armored vehicles abandoned for lack of fuel, its soldiers foraging for food, its transport planes shot out of the sky, its various military elements — tanks, infantry, aircraft — unable to coordinate their aims,"" Fred Kaplan notes at Slate. Putin wanted a blitzkrieg, ""but the Russian army isn't cut out for lightning strikes."" ""If we've learned anything in this conflict so far, it's that theoretical Russian advantages don't always translate to battlefield success,"" Beauchamp adds. ""And there are reasons to think that Ukraine may once again repulse the Russian attack."" ""Among Russia's most costly mistakes when it invaded Ukraine was the expectation that it would dominate the electronic warfare part of the battle,"" David Ignatius writes in The Washington Post. The aim of the ""exotic"" military art of electronic warfare ""is to attack an adversary by manipulating the electromagnetic spectrum — through jamming, intercepting or altering communications, radar, GPS, or other signals,"" and ""the Russians overestimated their own capabilities, underestimated Ukraine's — and didn't reckon on the power of NATO military support for Kyiv."" Russia's electronic warfare ops were ""dazzling"" when it invaded Ukraine in 2014, but Ukraine sharply improved its capabilities since then and ""Russia's centralized, top-down command structure"" meant nobody was empowered to ""make speedy fixes,"" Ignatius adds. So ""when their fancy communications equipment broke down, the Russians resorted to cellphones on Ukrainian networks, which revealed not just their plans but their locations — allowing precise attacks,"" including one that killed Maj. Gen. Andrei Simonov, ""among his country's leading electronic war specialists."" ""While Russia gets weaker, Ukraine gets stronger: It now has more tanks than at the start of the war, much better artillery, and far more weapons systems of all kinds,"" Max Boot writes at the Post. ""Russian morale is poor, with officers reportedly disobeying orders; Ukrainian morale is sky-high."" And ""Russia has paid a fearsome price for meager gains,"" Boot adds. ""Kyiv claims that more than 25,000 Russian soldiers have been killed,"" probably only a slight exaggeration, and ""open-source reporting confirms that Russia has lost more than 3,500 vehicles (including more than 600 tanks), 121 aircraft, and nine naval vessels, including the flagship of the Black Sea fleet. Those are the worst losses Russia has suffered since World War II."" The U.S. and its allies have hit Russia with all kinds of punitive sanctions, many of them aimed at preventing Russia from rebuilding its arsenal. And it's already working, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo testified before Congress. ""We have reports from Ukrainians that when they find Russian military equipment on the ground, it's filled with semiconductors that they took out of dishwashers and refrigerators."" ""We're going to see additional impacts on the battlefield as the Russian aerospace industry and the Russian maritime industry is unable to source its parts, which they need in order to keep their planes flying, their submarines moving and their boats sailing,"" Raimondo deputy Matthew Axelrod told The Wall Street Journal's Risk & Compliance Forum. Russia's failures are due in part to ""the valiant resistance of Ukraine's army and civilian defense forces,"" Slate's Kaplan writes. ""But it's also due to the fact that the Russian army just isn't very good."" Seriously, ""I've watched the Russian army for years. I knew they weren't good, but I never suspected they'd were this bad,"" retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling tweeted. ""Corruption has taken over their ranks, their government, their leadership on a scale that is mafia-like."" In fact, Putin valorizes Russia's defeat of the Nazis in World War II ""because Russia's history offers few comparable military achievements,"" explains Sir Lawrence Freedman, the dean of British war studies scholars. The 20th century began with Russia's ""humiliating defeat at the hands of Japan"" and ended with Russia ""humiliated by the secessionist Chechnya in one war"" before winning the second only ""by adopting brutal tactics."" Russia's bloody and costly victory in 1945 ""left an abiding image of a military steamroller, a mass army crushing all before it through its sheer weight,"" but ""it is now apparent that there is no steamroller,"" Freedman writes. Still, the idea's ""influence on the Russian generals helps explain the arrogance behind their initial plans, as if Ukrainian forces would crumble once confronted with a Russian offensive."" The sad irony is that both Adolf Hitler and Napoleon Bonaparte made similar and ruinous strategic miscalculations about Soviet and tsarist Russia, respectively, Joe Donato writes at the Modern War Institute. ""Vladimir Putin is not Hitler or Napoleon, but there are striking similarities between the flawed theory of victory that undergirded his foray into Ukraine and their doomed invasions of Russia.""

5/16/2022,"(Note profanity in paragraph 2) By Jonathan Landay RUSKA LOZOVA, Ukraine May 15 (Reuters) - While three of his men heaped dark soil into a chin-high berm to shield their trench, Ohor Obolenskiy gestured on Sunday across sun-dappled fields to a tree-clad ridge line sweeping the nearby horizon. “We can see the Russian positions from here and say, ‘Fuck you, Russians,’” the 35-year-old Ukrainian commander joshed in rough English, his grim face creasing into a wide grin. The amalgam of National Guard and volunteers he leads seized Ruska Lozova in fierce fighting on May 8, four days into a counteroffensive that has thwarted Russia’s bid to seize nearby Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city. The counter-offensive has been Ukraine's most successful since it expelled Russian troops from the north of the country and the area around the capital Kyiv at the end of March, and signals a new turning point in the battle for the east. For the first week, the troops in Ruska Lozova said, Russian shelling was so intense they only could move about the now-devastated village at night. While they remain ever-alert to the high explosives regularly hurled by Russian artillery and tanks, Obolenskiy and his men made little effort to conceal themselves from the foe hunkered along the ridge line three kilometers away. One reason, they said as Reuters toured their positions, was because the patchy cloud made it difficult for Russian drones to target their positions. Another was because they believed the Russians, while trying to keep them pinned down, have been pulling their forces out in a withdrawal to their border. From there, they think, those troops are redeploying south to bolster a Russian drive to seize the entire Donbas region, which largely has stalled. “There is less shelling from the Russians,” said Mikhayl, one of Obolenskiy’s lieutenants, giving only his nom de guerre as he sat in a basement ripe with the odor of the unbathed troops encamped in its gloom. “We think they are retreating.” Yet, the troops holding the village, deserted by all but a few of its 5,000 residents and a horde of abandoned cats and dogs, are not ready to celebrate what some media outlets have begun hailing as their victory in the Battle of Kharkiv. They still are fighting the Russians - they lost two soldiers on Saturday - whose helicopter gunships search for their positions in low-level runs to avoid the U.S.-made Stinger missiles with which Obolenskiy’s troops are armed. Moreover, Obolenskiy and his aides said they remained concerned that despite high loses in men and equipment, Russian President Vladimir Putin could launch a new offensive against Kharkiv, 20 km south. “We think it’s possible that the Russians will come back,” said Mikhayl, a large man who declined to reveal the contingent’s total casualties. “Putin will never forgive us. It will be difficult for him to explain to the Russian people why his special operation is over.” Putin said that he launched what he called a special military operation on Feb. 24 to protect his nuclear-armed country from a threat posed by what he calls a fascist government in Kyiv. Kyiv and its foreign supporters call it an unprovoked war of aggression to subjugate Ukraine. 'ALL THE WAY TO SIBERIA' The Ukrainians bunkered in deserted homes, cellars and garages around Ruska Lozova have no doubt that the Russian forces arrayed around the Kharkiv region will retreat across the border. But they disagreed about comes next, with several saying they want to take the fight into Russia. “I want to go all the way to Novosibirsk. The videos that I have seen of what they have done leave me no choice,” growled Mihkayl, referring to a city in Siberia, and to alleged war crimes committed by Russian forces against Ukrainians. Moscow denies targeting civilians. Obolenskiy, however, said he is concerned that Russian forces will shell Ukrainian troops from inside their border in a deliberate ploy to trigger return barrages that would allow Putin to justify an escalation of the conflict to suck in NATO. “Putin wants to start a war with NATO,” said Obolenskiy, who believes an escalation should be avoided by creating 10 km-wide buffer zones on either side of the border. The fighting for Ruska Lozova devastated the village that sits in a fold cut by the Lozovenka River through rolling hills north of Kharkiv. A bridge across the river has been smashed into two fire-blackened halves. The detritus of war litters fields and rutted lanes pitted by shell craters and lined by destroyed and damaged homes. A Russian T-72 tank captured by the Ukrainians in working condition sat in the shadows of a carport, ready for use against its original owners. A young officer, who gave only the first name of Klem, walked briskly through untended orchards, taking a visitor into abandoned Russian bunkers littered with molding rations and military gear. When the Russians advanced to the outskirts of Kharkiv in February, he said, the village was a rear base. “Now,” he said, “their frontline is in those trees, three kilometers away.” (Reporting by Jonathan Landay Editing by Peter Graff)",World/Reuters,Ukrainian troops holding destroyed village believe Russians withdrawing across border,https://news.yahoo.com/ukrainian-troops-holding-destroyed-village-172917119.html
