5/15/2022,"The latest Omicron SARS-CoV-2 subvariant, which scientists have labeled BA.2.12.1, is on track to become the most virulent strain in the United States currently. An increase in new cases is being linked to common symptoms related to this highly contagious variant, which may be indistinguishable from other seasonal conditions this spring. Leading experts say you should take 3 upper respiratory symptoms seriously and test for COVID-19 sooner rather than later. In this article, you'll learn: Common symptoms associated with the BA.2.12.1 strain; a full list of potential COVID-19 symptoms; Does the latest Omicron subvariant spread faster than others?; And how to prevent infection by the BA.2.12.1 strain. A new subvariant of the Omicron strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that leads to a COVID-19 diagnosis, has overtaken earlier variations (including ""stealth"" Omicron) to likely become the most viral variant here in the United States. According to data corralled by officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the viral subvariant — which has yet to earn an informal nickname, but scientists have labeled BA.2.12.1 — has been linked to 43% of total COVID-19 cases in the U.S., which is a major jump from the 7% it was accounting for back in early April. Government officials are racing to collect new information on how current vaccines stack up in protecting Americans from the spread of BA.2.12.1, alongside its genetic characteristics that sets it apart from other SARS-CoV-2 viruses. This particular subvariant is the most infectious of the Omicron collection of viruses, as the third iteration of Omicron that first began increasing breakthrough COVID-19 cases late last fall. Susan Huang, M.D., the medical director of epidemiology and infection prevention at UCI Health in Orange County, indicates that current data available to healthcare providers suggest this latest Omicron subvariant is highly contagious. ""This variant is about 25% more contagious than the original Omicron variant that entered the U.S. last fall — seemingly accounting for about 40% of current cases,"" she tells Good Housekeeping. We continue to see new variants, and their different lineages and sublineages, emerge & disappear as they compete against each other. This is expected. @CDCgov is prepared to quickly identify any new variant & evaluate the public health impact.Updated variant proportions. ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/VDB1VghCFn — Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH (@CDCDirector) April 27, 2022  Dr. Huang adds that hospitalizations have remained low — and it may be because Americans simply aren't aware they're dealing with a bonafide SARS-CoV-2 infection. ""It is clear that the disproportionate share of infections are those that are weathered at home,"" she says. ""It is highly anticipated that a more targeted vaccine to current variants will be needed for the fall."" What kind of symptoms does this highly contagious variant present, you may wonder? BA.2.12.1 cases are coming at a time when spring allergies are affecting many Americans, which is why it's crucial to identify potentially misleading symptoms and consider COVID-19 testing sooner. Read on to learn more about the newest Omicron subvariant and its most common symptoms. COVID-19 cases have been on the rise in the U.S., driven by an uptick in infections caused by the BA.2.12.1 subvariant — most of which may not be diagnosed as early as possible due to a lack of testing, explains Sachin Nagrani, M.D., medical director at care provider Heal. ""There's been an increase in the rate of COVID cases in the U.S. recently, currently above 80,000 [new] cases per day,"" he says, adding that it's dramatically less than the 800,000+ cases per day noted at the start of 2022. ""We have also crossed the grim milestone of 1 million American lives lost to COVID."" Both experts and public health officers seem to have noted that the BA.2.12.1 variant may be triggering mild breakthrough cases that don't prompt sick individuals to think about signing up for a COVID-19 test. Early infection symptoms that are commonly being noted with these particular infections may have something to do with that, explains Dr. Huang. ""Initial symptoms appear to be related to a scratchy or sore throat, often quite mild,"" she says. ""Other early symptoms are sneezing, or a runny nose — both of these often cause infected individuals to think they are suffering from allergies or a mild cold, which they hope is not COVID."" As of May 9, 2022, national forecasts predict 900–10,200 new #COVID19 hospitalizations will likely be reported on June 3.

This is likely how BA.2.12.1 is spreading quite rapidly; in the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut alone, the viral subvariant is tied to upwards of 70% of new infections alone, per recent reports. It does indeed seem that BA.2.12.1 is more easily transmissible than earlier strains of Omicron SARS-CoV-2, as experts have established it is about 25% more transmissible than ""stealth"" Omicron, or about 75% more transmissible than original Omicron strains that impacted the 2021 winter holiday season. Risk for severe illness stemming from this particular subvariant applies to those who have yet to be vaccinated against COVID-19, or those who have had an incomplete vaccination series — as well as those who have yet to receive a recommended third booster vaccine. Those who are fully up-to-date on their shots are at less risk of mild infection, Dr. Huang stresses; but they are not impervious to getting sick, even if it's a second COVID-19 sickness. ""Preliminary data from studies in Beijing and South Africa have signaled what is expected; new variants and subvariants may be more likely to cause reinfection in an individual who was previously infected with an old variant,"" Dr. Nagrani explains. ""The vaccines will most likely remain effective with BA.2.12.1, as they were intended to prevent severe COVID and hospitalization — but not for preventing infection [outright]."" Most reports indicate that even the latest Omicron subvariant doesn't lead to severe symptoms in breakthrough cases, nor a spike in hospitalizations or death outright. But it's also crucial to remember that no two COVID-19 illnesses are the same; it's entirely possible that an infection triggered by BA.2.12.1 may lead to early upper respiratory symptoms that resemble a cold or reaction to allergies, or it may simply present any of the other known COVID-19 symptoms entirely (including fatigue alone!). Any combination, and varying levels of severity, of the following symptoms may be triggered by an Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here's a full list of known, potential COVID-19 symptoms for any individual, according to the CDC: Cough Shortness of breath, difficulty breathing Fever or chills Fatigue or body aches Headache New loss of taste or smell Sore throat Congestion, runny nose Nausea or vomiting Diarrhea The best way to prevent getting sick is to ensure you're up-to-date on your COVID vaccinations, including any recommended boosters (even if that means seeking out another vaccine brand manufacturer). ""If you are eligible for the additional booster this spring, please get it to receive additional protection against both mild and severe disease,"" Dr. Huang advises. ""You will still be eligible for the upcoming fall booster that will have modifications to improve its effect against newer variants."" As of May 9, 258.2 million people have received at least one dose of a #COVID19 vaccine. Of those, 220.2 million are fully vaccinated. More than 101.3 million people have received a COVID-19 booster dose.

Masks are also still an important part of COVID-19 prevention; especially if you or someone you live with is considered high risk for severe complications, or are currently at risk for severe disease. ""Masking is also important if you have something crucial on your schedule; a vacation, a graduation, or even a medical procedure where you need to be healthy for that important activity,"" Dr. Huang adds. ""Be mindful of your symptoms and test early for COVID so that you can take steps to protect others from infection, especially as it relates to events like these.""

5/15/2022,"Louisiana authorities are searching for three juvenile inmates who escaped from a detention facility, allegedly with the help of a 21-year-old security guard, the state police said Saturday. Tyjuan Lafitte, 17; Na'varaya Lane, 17; and Jeremiah Durham, 15; all escaped from the Ware Youth Center in Coushatta just before 3:00 a.m. on Saturday, police said. Video footage showed 21-year-old security guard Victoria Tune taking the trio off the premises in a white 2010 Pontiac G6, the Red River Parish Sheriff's Office said in a statement. Police were not alerted until approximately 6:50 a.m., when incoming day shift employees noticed the three were missing, the sheriff's office said. Lafitte is charged with attempted first degree murder, Lane is charged with attempted second degree murder and Durham is charged with armed robbery, state police said, adding that ""all three are considered dangerous."" The three juveniles are now also wanted for simple escape, and Tune is wanted for three counts of accessory to simple escape, state police said. All three juveniles were last seen wearing orange jumpsuits. State police and the sheriff's office provided two slightly different license plate numbers: VWY295 and VWY296. New York Gov.

5/15/2022,"By Tom Balmforth KYIV (Reuters) - Ukrainian forces are on the counteroffensive near the Russian-held town of Izium, the governor of Kharkiv region said on Saturday, striking at a key axis of Russia's assault on eastern Ukraine. A major and successful counteroffensive on that Russian line of advance would deal a serious setback for Moscow in the Battle for the Donbas, a region in Ukraine's east that Russia has said it wants to capture completely. Moscow's forces have been trying to fight their way south from the town of Izium, the northern part of a Russian pincer movement aimed at outflanking battle-hardened Ukrainian forces dug in to defend the eastern front line. ""The hottest spot remains the Izium direction,"" regional governor Oleh Sinegubov said in comments aired on social media. ""Our armed forces have switched to a counteroffensive there. The enemy is retreating on some fronts and this is the result of the character of our armed forces,"" he said. In a possible shift in momentum in the war, Ukraine has been recapturing territory in its northeast, driving Russia away from the second-largest Ukrainian city of Kharkiv in their fastest advance since Moscow's troops pulled away from Kyiv. Ukrainian forces destroyed parts of a Russian armoured column as it tried to cross a river in the Donbas, video from Ukraine's military showed on Friday, and its defence minister predicted many weeks of grinding fighting ahead. Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, driving towards but failing to reach the capital, before withdrawing to focus its firepower on the south and the Donbas. Moscow announced on April 19 that the second phase of what it calls its ""special operation"" had begun. It says the operation's aim is to disarm Ukraine and protect it from fascists, a claim Kyiv and its Western allies dismiss as a false pretext to wage an unprovoked war of aggression.

5/15/2022,"NEW YORK — The Tikvah Fund, a conservative Jewish organization, was all set to host a conference in June at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York, when months of planning were suddenly derailed by its last-minute addition of a speaker who might have once been uncontroversial: the Republican governor of Florida. The fund had invited Gov. Ron DeSantis to discuss the vibrancy of Jewish life in Florida, a topic the fund wrote about in the April issue of its magazine, one month after DeSantis had signed legislation that prohibits classroom instruction and discussion about sexual orientation and gender identity in the early grades of elementary schools. Opponents have called the legislation the “Don’t Say Gay” law. Tikvah signed a contract and sent it to the museum before DeSantis was added to the lineup; the trouble began once the group updated its program to include the governor. Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times “Thanks for sharing this with me,” read an email to the fund from Trudy Chan, an official with the museum. Chan noted that providing security for the governor would not be a problem, but she added: “We would need to ascertain if there are any potential conflicts with your invited speakers. Please stand by.” The next day, Chan asked the fund to “pause” its $11,500 deposit and requested a conversation with its leaders, according to emails. In subsequent phone calls, Eric Cohen, the CEO of Tikvah, was informed that an event with DeSantis could not be held at the museum, which describes itself as “a living memorial to the Holocaust,” because the “Don’t Say Gay” bill does not align with its values of inclusivity, Cohen told The New York Times. The museum does not allow political speakers or events at its museum, Cohen said he was told, despite recent events featuring Democratic politicians like Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “The museum has implied that Tikvah wanted to host a partisan political event,” Cohen said. “Our event endorses no candidates and serves no political party. It is all about ideas, just like every prior conference we have held at the museum.” The museum’s CEO, Jack Kliger, declined several requests to be interviewed for this article, but the museum has explained its actions in a series of public statements that expressed its concern with the political nature of the event and the amount of security the governor might need. A spokesperson for the Museum of Jewish Heritage emphasized that the museum had nothing to do with the event outside of discussing the rental of its space to the Tikvah Fund. Politics have become increasingly challenging for Jewish institutions in recent years, as Americans have become divided over issues like LGBTQ policies and the results of the 2020 presidential election. New York City is no exception. Neighborhoods with a large population of Reform Jews voted decisively for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election, while those with many ultra-Orthodox Jews overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump. That has put institutions like the Museum of Jewish Heritage in a difficult position. “As American domestic politics has become more and more ferociously polarized, and increasingly as people see conservatives not just as different but fundamentally anti-democratic or illiberal or authoritarian or racist, holding together this big tent is really, really difficult,” said Peter Beinart, a writer and editor-at-large for Jewish Currents, a progressive magazine, who also writes for the Times. “Any institution that is built today on the need to serve both conservatives and progressives, whether it is the NFL or a Jewish museum or anything else, is finding that work harder and harder to do,” Beinart said. The Tikvah Fund first made its complaints about the museum's actions in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal written by Cohen and Elliott Abrams, a national security official in several Republican presidential administrations and a special representative in the Trump administration. In it, they accused the museum of engaging in cancel culture and speculated that its leaders may have been afraid of protests because “a lot of people dislike Mr. DeSantis.” “In the name of inclusivity, a Jewish museum sent us a clear message: Some people are to be excluded,” they wrote. “In the name of fighting hate, the museum decided that the millions of Floridians who support Governor DeSantis — including many Jews — are so hateful that they don’t even merit a voice in the great American conversation. A museum of tolerance has become intolerant.” After the opinion piece was published, the museum issued a public statement that said the article “contains many factual inaccuracies,” and described the decision as “simply a contractual and logistical decision.” It invited DeSantis to visit the museum as a tourist and accused Tikvah of “trying to create a fight where none exists.” “No one was banned or canceled,” the statement said. “The fact is that no contract with the Tikvah Fund was ever signed for this rental event to be held at the museum, and no deposit was ever made.” The museum never signed the contract, but a negotiation between the two parties had been underway, according to the Tikvah Fund, which said that there had been a series of emails discussing the event and the museum’s $23,000 rental fee before it was announced that DeSantis would be joining the lineup. In a letter to The Wall Street Journal, Kliger accused Tikvah of “political bullying” and duplicity, saying it signed the contract just so it could accuse the museum of canceling it. He wrote that the situation arose in part because the fund had not promptly provided the museum with details about the conference, which seemed to have a political nature that violated the museum charter. “When we declined to host the event, Tikvah resorted to threats, saying we had created an enemy,” Kliger wrote. “Tikvah knew that this was not about banning anyone from speaking but decided to make the false claim anyway.” In a subsequent statement to the Times, Kliger emphasized yet another reason. “Late in discussions” with Tikvah, the museum realized the event “warranted significant additional security,” he wrote. “The intensity of those security requirements clearly implied a potential level of activity around the conference that was not standard practice for the museum.” Kliger emphasized this point in his letter to The Wall Street Journal. “This was not about banning or canceling Gov. DeSantis,” he wrote. “The museum must consider the safety of visitors and staff.” DeSantis declined to comment, although a statement from his office chastised the museum for what it described as the politicization of a sacred space. “A Holocaust memorial should never be politicized,” it said, adding that the governor is committed to keeping Florida “a safe and welcoming home for the Jewish people.” The Tikvah Fund will still present the 2022 Jewish Leadership Conference. Appearing at Pier 60 in Manhattan this June alongside DeSantis will be a number of prominent speakers, including Mike Pompeo, secretary of state under Trump, and John Podhoretz, the editor of Commentary magazine. Topics will include “How to Fight Back Against Wokeness: A Jewish View” — a conversation between Podhoretz and Bari Weiss, a former Times opinion writer — and “On Jewish Exceptionalism.” © 2022 The New York Times Company",U.S./The New York Times,What Happened When a Conservative Jewish Group Invited DeSantis to Speak,https://news.yahoo.com/happened-conservative-jewish-group-invited-142532806.html
