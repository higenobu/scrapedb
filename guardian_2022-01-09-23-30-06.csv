1/9/2022,"Westminster is failing to take MPs’ safety seriously enough despite public anger over the coronavirus pandemic, lockdowns and Brexit, according to Kim Leadbeater, the sister of Jo Cox. The Labour MP for Batley and Spen believes not enough has changed to protect parliamentarians since Cox was murdered while representing the West Yorkshire constituency in 2016. In October, Sir David Amess, the MP for Southend West, was stabbed to death while he held a constituency surgery.  Leadbeater, whose lengthiest Commons speeches since she was elected in July have been tributes to her sister and Amess, said that while new measures had come in since Cox’s death, safety had not remained a priority despite the polarising issues of Brexit and Covid lockdowns having “facilitated a lot of anger” in society. “Not enough has changed. And I don’t think we take the issue of safety and security quite seriously enough, and I include some MPs in that,” she said. While acknowledging that some “particular people [who] have done this job for a long time and haven’t been directly impacted by any issues around safety and security” wish to remain accessible to constituents, she believes politicians now face “a different climate”. “For whatever reason … there are people who would wish us harm and we have to be realistic about that. We’ve seen the evidence of that. I think things have changed a little bit [since Cox was killed], but ultimately we’ve still got another [killed] MP and we need to look at why that is the case.” Since her election, Leadbeater, 45, carries three panic alarms with her wherever she goes and said that support from police and enhanced security for her office helped staff feel safe. “I do feel safe, but to be fair I am very cautious. And I am extremely well looked after by West Yorkshire police,” she said. “But I am still carrying around three alarms. That’s not the best situation.” Leadbeater said that after the investigation into Amess’s killing was concluded, parliamentary authorities needed to have “serious conversations” about what needs to change, while maintaining “the very important balance between protecting MPs and protecting democracy”. “The main thing for me is that his family are given as much support as they possibly can, to help them get through it, because there are horrific months and years to come for them. And it’ll never end - that’s the reality,” she said. The MP called for online anonymity to become “the exception, rather than the rule” to combat a culture where abuse, particularly towards female MPs, has “become normalised”. In the short period since her election she had had “lots of conversations” with colleagues who regularly received “vile abuse online” and threatening emails. “We need to change that culture so that is not acceptable,” she said. Echoing recommendations of the Intimidation in Public Life report published in 2017 as a result of Cox’s murder, many of which have not been implemented, Leadbeater said MPs should “make sure that we are conducting ourselves to a high standard”. She believes the confrontational exchanges at prime minister’s questions fuel aggressive attitudes towards politicians, and would prefer the media showcased more cross-party work rather than focusing on “subjects that fuel anger”. “Sometimes [PMQs] gets very heated. And I think the danger is then that people will say, ‘Look at how you behave, why should we behave any differently?’” Leadbeater, who trained as a wellbeing coach and personal trainer, said she was fascinated by the level of anger in society. “I always think, I’ve got as much right as anybody to be angry about what’s happened to us, and now my life has been totally ripped apart. But I’ve never given in to that. “Two big factors which have facilitated a lot of anger are Brexit, and the pandemic and lockdown. You’ve got two very divisive subjects, which really do polarise people, which everyone’s got an opinion on and that doesn’t happen that often in life,” she said. Leadbeater believes the “more in common” approach that she promoted through the Jo Cox Foundation after her sister’s death is key to tackling divisive topics, and can be more successful in changing people’s minds or behaviour than an anti-racism framing. “There’s a great quote that says ‘you’ve never made anyone be less racist by calling him a racist’,” she said. Citing a woman who she said had greeted her and a colleague with: “Oh, I never liked that Jo Cox anyway, she let them all in, didn’t she?” Leadbeater asked why she thought that. “Actually, I’d rather speak to her than somebody who agrees with me on everything. Because perhaps then we can have a really powerful conversation.” She also hopes to find common ground in polarised debates on sex and gender. “It’s about human rights,” she said. “We’ve got to have those conversations, but ultimately, for me, it’s very, very feasible to be an advocate for trans rights and to be a really strong, powerful feminist. They’re not mutually exclusive.” This approach has not always been successful, however. Leadbeater reveals she “naively” suggested approaching George Galloway, the independent candidate, to ask him not to stand in the Batley and Spen byelection to help avoid what became a contest mired in accusations of intimidatory tactics. A spokesperson for Galloway has previously said he condemns all forms of physical intimidation. “I said, do you think it’s worth us reaching out to him and asking him if he would mind not standing because it’s probably not what our constituents or our community needs? We need someone who brings people together, not pulls them apart. And everybody just went: ‘no,’” she laughed.",News/Politics,"MPs’ safety not being taken seriously enough, says Kim Leadbeater",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/09/mps-safety-not-being-taken-seriously-enough-says-kim-leadbeater
1/9/2022,"More than 13,000 people have joined a campaign to support one of Greater Manchester’s first female bus drivers who was dismissed for being “too short”. When Tracey Scholes, 57, walked into Manchester’s Queen’s Road depot in 1987 as the first, and only, woman, she said “you could have heard a pin drop”.  Thirty-four years later, Scholes, who stands at 1.52m (five feet) tall, has lost her job because she lacks the “capability” to drive the new model of bus used on her route. The combination of a change in position of wing mirrors and the pillar on an assault screen installed to protect drivers means Scholes would have to lean back to use the mirror – leaving her unable to reach the pedals. The decision has taken its toll on Scholes, who said she is struggling emotionally and has “put everything on hold financially” as she feels unable to plan for the future. She did not buy any Christmas presents as she worried about the end of her notice period approaching in early February amid a cost of living crisis. From her initial interview, when she was told there were no toilets she could use and questioned as to how she would handle “the bad language”, Scholes has faced challenges in an industry that remains male-dominated – about 84% of bus drivers in 2021 were men. She was forced to find solutions to the physical challenges of the job while pregnant – including climbing on the dashboard to change the bus route number, as well as dealing with sexual harassment because she wanted to “pave the way for women to come and drive”. “I’ve had comments, sexual remarks, a lot of things. And I’ve dealt with that. I’ve not gone to management, I’ve gone and solved it and hit it head on,” Scholes said. “When I started that job 34 years ago, I could drive everything in that depot. And since they’ve done this, I can’t drive that bus now. If a bicycle or pedestrian was to walk up the near side of the vehicle … I can’t see that, it blocks my vision and that’s not safe,” she added. After raising concerns with her employer, Go North West, she was initially suspended and later dismissed with 12 weeks notice. Supported by her union, Unite, Scholes said the company has offered her different routes with buses that she is able to drive, but the hours – and pay – are less than in her previous contract. She faces a final appeal against the decision on Tuesday. “I’ve got three children, I’m a widow and I’ve got a mortgage to pay, I can’t take a pay cut,” said Scholes. Although she said the company’s decision “broke her heart”, the support from colleagues, celebrities including actors Maxine Peake, Julie Hesmondhalgh and James Quinn and others “has been absolutely overwhelming”. More than 13,000 people have signed a petition to reinstate Scholes to a job she said she “just loves”. Caroline Criado-Perez, author of Invisible Women, which uses data to explore products that are designed for men as a default, wrote that while Scholes is slightly shorter than the UK average for women (161.6cm) , she is still taller than the 5th percentile female crash test dummy that is mandated in one out of the five EU car crash regulations. “So how is it that a bus could be built in such a way that someone who is taller than the 5th percentile female crash test dummy is designed out of being able to drive it?”. Unite’s general secretary, Sharon Graham, called for Scholes to be reinstated on full pay and full hours. “She has given 34 years of unblemished service. It seems inconceivable, that due to the blind intransigence of its local management in Manchester, Go Ahead is now ready to watch unlimited damage to its international reputation as a result of the tawdry treatment of Tracey.” A Go North West spokesperson said Scholes was a valued member of the team and they had made “numerous proposals to accommodate” Scholes, but the suggestions were rejected. “The design of the mirrors on our buses was agreed after consultation with Unite some time ago. All our other drivers of similar height to Tracey are able to view them safely. Dedicated, experienced, hardworking bus drivers are difficult to find and so we would never act lightly in a situation like this. We are sorry that we were left with no choice but to bring this driver’s employment to an end.” The company also said it is working to improve female representation at all levels, with a particular focus on attracting female bus drivers. The Go-Ahead Group have a target of raising the number of female bus drivers from around 11% to 20% by 2025.",News/UK news,Support increases for Manchester bus driver sacked for being ‘too short’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/09/support-grows-manchester-bus-driver-tracey-scholes-sacked-too-short
1/9/2022,"A London hospital leader has said he may lose 1,000 staff to the Covid vaccination mandate, but hopes admissions from the Omicron wave have peaked in in the capital. The chief executive of King’s College hospital NHS trust, Prof Clive Kay, told the BBC’s Sunday Morning programme that his organisation was working urgently to encourage staff to come forward for vaccination to avoid redeploying or losing them.  About 10% of the 14,000 staff at King’s College hospital are yet to be fully vaccinated ahead of a mandate for all NHS staff who work directly with patients that comes into force on 1 April. Losing more than 1,000 staff would be the most extreme outcome and there had been an increase in the number of people who still required vaccination coming forward, Kay said. “I don’t want, at this stage, to predict or give any numbers. We’re having conversations with staff, line managers are having conversations with staff, we have a helpline,” he said. “Ultimately if individuals choose not to, it’s their choice, their personal choice. The impact would depend on which areas the unvaccinated staff worked in, he said. “We’ll have to address that as we pass through the coming weeks. We will re-organise as we need to.” He said respiratory wards were busy but less so than during previous waves, and that he hoped the case numbers in his hospital from the latest Omicron wave had peaked. “I hope we can see the finishing line … but I’m not certain,” he said. A critical care consultant at King’s College hospital told the health secretary, Sajid Javid, during a visit to the facility that he refused to be vaccinated because he believed he had immunity from a previous infection with the virus. Steve James said faced dismissal if he did not come forward for vaccination. Kay did not comment on the case, but said the hospital was doing all it could to encourage staff. “We we must treat them with kindness, with compassion,” he said. “We must give them every single opportunity to talk through if they’ve don’t want the vaccine, if they’d like to talk, if they need any help or clarification but ultimately, it is their choice.” He also predicted that some doctors would leave the profession as a result of the unprecedented strain of working through the pandemic. “Some of the things they have seen and experienced and the things they’ve had to go through, I think will last a very, very long time, if not forever,” he said. “I do fear that some of them will decide that, actually, they don’t want to stay.” His comments came as the statistician Prof David Spiegelhalter said it was hard to envisage another big rise in Covid intensive care admissions and deaths. “The cases are not going up as fast as they were and may have stabilised over the whole country, but at very high levels and they’re not going to come down rapidly,” he told Times Radio. Spiegelhalter, from the University of Cambridge, said daily infection rates could still hit 500,000, which would have had a devastating effect without the protection afforded by vaccines.

1/9/2022,"Eight children born with a “devastating” genetic disease in England have become the first in the world to receive a “pioneering” treatment aimed at stopping them from going blind. Doctors at Great Ormond Street hospital in London are trialling a drug they believe may save the eyesight of the children who have CLN2-type Batten disease. Brineura, already successful in animals, is being administered to four boys and four girls on a compassionate use basis.  The groundbreaking treatment works by restoring a “missing” enzyme that nerves in the back of the eyes need to function. Clinicians and families hope a body of evidence built up over the next year will allow the drug to be offered more widely to children affected around the world. CLN2 disease is caused by a change in a gene responsible for producing a vital enzyme in the nervous system. The enzyme recycles waste materials, and without it, waste builds up. CLN2, which affects 50 children in the UK and hundreds worldwide, initially causes seizures, then a gradual decline in their ability to walk, speak and see, as well as progressive dementia. Life expectancy is 10 to 12 years. The Carroll family have been struck twice by CLN2: eight-year-old Amelia and her 10-year-old brother, Ollie, both have it. It is too late to save Ollie’s sight but Amelia has been selected for the trial. Their mother, Lucy, from Cheshire, said: “We have watched our son Ollie go blind, and now the same is starting to happen to Amelia. But we have been given this chance, this hope. To save a child’s sight would be incredible, and make such a big difference to Amelia’s quality of life.” Carroll said “any vision” saved for Amelia would be “better than nothing”, adding: “We’re just hoping that she can prove this treatment does work so that children in the future can get it in both eyes and it will save their sight.” With Ollie turning 11 in January, Carroll is conscious he may now not have long to live. “We’ve learned to live every day as the last,” she said. “And create as many memories as we can – just spend as much time as we can with the children together as a family.” The drug being trialled is already used to help prevent neurological deterioration in children with Batten disease. Brineura was first approved for use on the NHS in 2019 and is administered directly into the brain by a regular infusion. It has been shown to restore enzyme activity and slow the onset of disability. But although it is effective in preventing movement and speech loss, the brain infusion does not prevent children losing their sight because it cannot reach the nerves in the eye. In the programme at Great Ormond Street hospital, clinicians are using the tiny amount of the drug leftover from the brain infusion and injecting it directly into the back of the eyes of the children. The eight patients – aged between four and 10 – have been chosen by doctors to trial the treatment provided under general anaesthetic after it proved safe and effective in animals. Doctors are treating one eye in each child every two months, and after a year they will compare the difference in vision between the two eyes. The trial has been made possible only after a huge fundraising campaign led by the families of children affected by the disease and the Batten Disease Family Association (BDFA). Together, they have raised more than £200,000, with the hope the trial can change the lives of others. A second child undergoing the new treatment is eight-year-old Londoner Kavyansh. His father, Dr Rahul Dubey, said: “Kavy was diagnosed with CLN2 when he was just four years old and nothing could have been more devastating. The brain infusions helped to stabilise Kavy but watching his vision deteriorate over these years and him lose confidence, has been most painful. “Like so many other families of children with this awful disease, we knew we had to do everything we could and we worked closely with the clinical team at GOSH and help get this programme under way. We feel extremely lucky that Kavy has some chance to keep the little sight he has left; it means everything for us.” Dr Paul Gissen, an honorary consultant in paediatric metabolic diseases at Great Ormond Street hospital, said: “The enzyme replacement therapy given into the brain has completely changed the lives of children with CLN2-type Batten disease for the better, but it has been difficult to watch their sight deteriorate even as their other physical symptoms are more controlled. The multi-disciplinary team at GOSH has been working hard to find a way to try to treat this and it’s only been possible thanks to the fundraising and tireless work of the patients’ families.”",News/Society,New treatment may save eyesight of children with ‘devastating’ CLN2 disease,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/09/new-treatment-may-save-eyesight-of-children-with-devastating-cln2-disease
1/9/2022,"This was the payoff. There can be times watching Test cricket when you wonder about the sense of investing the equivalent of a full-time working week into a single sporting match. There can be times when a non-contest is over in half that time and you still wonder if it was worth the expense. But then there are these times, the 15th session, the final hour of a fifth day, when the result is still on the line. The less good makes the great greater. This too is the glory of the draw, when one team can be miles away from the chance of a win but can still stop the other from achieving one. In the frantic final moments at Sydney, as fielders clustered around the bat as closely as dark clouds overhead, with Australia’s spinners having to bowl in light too bad for the quicks, and England’s final pair of bowlers had to do the job with the bat while Australia’s best batter did the job with the ball, it produced a thrill that transcended the series.  It would not have felt so great for the Australians afterwards, no matter the smiles and handshakes they shared with England following a noticeably good-tempered contest. For two years running, Australia has had a visiting team on the rack at the SCG, only to let them hold out for a draw. Last year it was an injured Hanuma Vihari and an injured Ravichandran Ashwin batting through the final session. This year it was an injured Ben Stokes and an injured Jonny Bairstow doing most of the work through the middle, only to fall and create an even more dramatic finish. This was the first blemish for Patrick Cummins as captain, after everything during the first three Tests of these Ashes has gone his way. His declaration left England 11 overs to survive late on the fourth day before a supposed 98 on the fifth. At that point Australia’s lead of 388 runs seemed vastly surplus to requirements, and so it turned out to be. Usman Khawaja’s second-innings century was a wonderful moment, and it would have been sad to have denied it. But even if Cummins had declared as soon as that landmark was raised, he would have saved two more precious overs. Instead he batted on after a drinks break. The reasoning may have been to let Cameron Green, then on 67, have a dash at a century of his own, which would be understandable as an investment in a young player to get him going in his Test batting career. But in the same way that there are only two kinds of leaves – good or bad – there are only two kinds of declarations. Rain was always forecast for the final day and in the end it shaved off seven more overs that could have been decisive. Another backfire was sending the wicketkeeper Alex Carey out to bat in that final over before the declaration. During a poor run with the bat in his first series, Carey was on a hiding to nothing. There was no value to him slogging another 10 or 20 runs, and in the end he was out first ball instead. Carey ended up having a poor match with the gloves, missing catches and most crucially fumbling a fourth-innings run out. Jonny Bairstow would have been gone from the fifth ball he faced. Instead he batted out another 100 balls and got into the last hour, taking his lower order teammates just close enough to get home. Then there was a late bowling choice. Scott Boland had been devastating again, knocking over the opener Haseeb Hameed, captain Joe Root, and finally Bairstow. He was making balls leap from the surface and deck both ways off the seam. Cummins had produced a savage burst that took care of Jos Buttler and Mark Wood in three balls. Those two working together in the final overs presented the greatest threat. Instead, with six over to go Cummins paired with the spinner Nathan Lyon, who England handled comfortably. Three overs later the umpires made their ruling about the light. By then Boland could have got two more overs in, and Lyon could have bowled two of the last three. In the end, bringing on Steve Smith nearly worked, as he took his first wicket in five years to dismiss Leach. But he couldn’t budge Anderson in the final over. These points may seem finicky, but in a series where everything has gone perfectly, the standards are higher. Australia’s main quicks had patches of tiredness, with Starc and Cummins both slower on average in this innings than any time in the series. The chance of a whitewash slipped – they are rare for a reason – and at least for a few days, England can hope to use this foothold to push back further in the fifth Test.

1/9/2022,"He has become a staple of EastEnders as Queen Vic landlord Mick Carter, but after nine years Danny Dyer will finally be leaving Walford, the BBC soap has confirmed. An exact date for Dyer’s departure has not been given, but EastEnders said the actor is not leaving imminently, with “plenty of explosive drama” for his character to come.  Reports indicated the departure of the soap’s biggest star had plunged the show into a crisis, after plummeting viewing figures and alleged low morale among staff. According to the Sunday Mirror, Dyer is leaving to appear in a Sky drama after they “gave him an offer he couldn’t refuse” – reported by the paper to be worth six figures. A source told the Mirror: “To say they [EastEnders] were upset to see him go is an understatement. But in the end they couldn’t convince him.” But a spokesperson for BBC show denied the show was in a crisis. “Danny will be leaving EastEnders when his contract comes to an end later this year,” they said. “Danny has made Mick Carter an iconic character, which we shall always be grateful for, however we won’t be saying goodbye just yet as there’s still quite some time – and plenty of explosive drama for Mick – to come before he departs Walford.” Dyer, 44, made his name in British films including Human Traffic, The Football Factory and Mean Machine, which celebrated his “hard-man” persona and trademark cockney accent. He’s also worked in theatre, appearing in three Pinter plays. The character of Mick Carter has long been a fan favourite and earned Dyer a string of National Television Awards – in 2015, 2016 and 2019. Portrayed as a lovable rogue, Mick’s storyline has often involved heartbreak and betrayal, including an affair with his daughter-in-law and the rape of his wife, Linda Carter, by his brother. In recent episodes he’s been fighting off the advances of Albert Square’s arch villain, Janine. A friend of Dyer said he was “incredibly grateful” to EastEnders and the opportunities it has given him … It wasn’t a decision he took lightly, but after playing Mick for nearly nine years he feels it’s time to give the character a rest.” In 2018, it was reported the actor had signed a £1m “golden handcuff” deal with the BBC that banned him from rival channels, fuelling speculation that his departure will help open the door to lucrative new opportunities elsewhere. Dyer’s exit also follows time off from the soap in 2017 because he had been working non-stop since he joined the cast in 2013. The actor was later caught on camera telling fans EastEnders “takes up my life”. At the time, his representatives said he was considering leaving the show, but he ultimately signed a new deal. An EastEnders source said Dyer made the decision “some time ago” that he would leave this year, giving bosses “plenty of time to plan a huge storyline for him”. The source added Dyer’s character will be “at the heart of some big drama” with the return of Linda Carter, played by Kellie Bright, this year.",Arts/Film,"Danny Dyer to leave EastEnders after nine years , BBC confirms",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/09/danny-dyer-to-leave-eastenders-after-nine-years-bbc-confirms
1/9/2022,"A photographer who received critical acclaim in his 90s for his work documenting the lives of south Asian immigrants over more than half a century is the subject of a new exhibition opening in February. Maganbhai Patel, known as Masterji, died 15 months after his first solo show of portraits of people living in the West Midlands from the 1950s until the 2000s. The recognition of his work at the end of his life brought him “quiet happiness”, said his daughter Tarla Patel.  The new exhibition, at Compton Verney in Warwickshire, includes many photographs that have not been displayed before. His early works were predominantly black-and-white portraits of young men who had come to find work in postwar Coventry. Later photographs reflected a more established community, with an increasing number of family portraits commissioned to mark events such as weddings. Masterji, who was the headmaster of a village school in India, arrived in the UK in 1951. Many immigrants found that only manual work was available to them, and he took a job in the General Electrical Company factory in Coventry. He joined the company’s photographic society and began taking pictures in his spare time. “I spent my first years in hostels and shared housing, mixing with the other migrants who were offered the promise of work and a better life – people from Poland, Italy, Jamaica and the West Indies,” he told the Guardian at the time of his first exhibition in 2016. “I think of this time with fondness. My wife remembers the terrible state of housing conditions and the cold, but I remember the shared friendships, the dancing and going to the pubs, playing on the piano and singing.” His reputation as a photographer spread, and eventually he gave up the factory work to open a studio. “The majority of my customers were from the Asian community, but there were people from many nationalities and backgrounds coming to have their photographs taken,” he said. Some of his clients wanted portraits to send home to their families in India, indicating their success in their new lives. One, named only as Kelly, a bus conductor, was photographed in a pinstripe suit and highly polished shoes. Another, Gordonbhai Bhakta, is pictured reclining on a table with a vase of flowers in the style of a film star. Masterji often retouched his photographs to enhance the images. Oli McCall, a curator at Compton Verney, said: “He often touched up the negatives to manipulate the colours, so there’s a painterly aspect to his work. Like many great portrait artists, he too kept a store of props and objects in the studio to add certain details into his photos, from pens and books to flowers and toys. It’s a tradition that dates back to the Renaissance and by using common-or-garden objects, Masterji brought it up to date but in his own, inimitable style.” The family’s photographic studio was always busy, said Tarla Patel. “We lived on top of the studio, and there were always customers downstairs. Dad was very talkative and personable, and his work gave him interaction with people.” His wife, Ramaben Patel, ran the business side of the enterprise, developed photographs and took pictures herself. Her contribution to Masterji’s success is highlighted in the exhibition. “My mother had to contend with the community around her. That may be why she didn’t pursue photography in her own right. She still doesn’t fully acknowledge her role, but I’m glad it’s recognised in this exhibition,” said Tarla Patel. Her parents were reluctant to speak about the challenges facing immigrants, especially racism. They were of a generation that was grateful for the opportunity to live and work in Britain, she said. “We did get our shop window broken a lot of times, and when the police came they were unhelpful. I remember having this worry at night over whether the windows would still be intact in the morning. It happened; you just swept it up and got on with ordering new glass.” The exhibition is accompanied by oral history recordings of people from the south Asian community in Coventry talking about the challenges many migrants faced after arriving in the UK, including racism and economic hardship. Shortly before he died, Masterji received an honorary doctor of arts degree from Coventry University, in recognition of his outstanding contribution to photography and the city’s heritage.

1/9/2022,"Britain’s unfolding cost of living crisis is dominating the headlines. The soaring cost of a weekly shop, a record increase looming for utility bills, and the price of petrol through the roof. Households have never had it so tough. Yet the squeeze has been in place for longer than the current crisis might suggest. Far from the year of the squeeze, the opening months of 2022 reflect the problems of the past decade, compounded by Covid-19.  Even before the pandemic struck British workers had suffered the worst decade for real wage growth since the Napoleonic wars. While 2022 will stand out for a particularly sharp hit to living standards, the Institute for Fiscal Studies reckons incomes will barely budge up until 2026. This means an unprecedented hit to earnings spanning two decades, and will leave household incomes 42% lower than would have been the case if wages had risen at pre-2008 financial crisis rates. In the 10 years leading up to the pandemic, median income for the poorest fifth of households in Britain collapsed by 4.8% thanks to a mix of weak pay growth and benefit cuts while living costs marched higher. In contrast, the incomes of the richest steadily rose. In the opening months of this year, the squeeze from soaring inflation and rising energy bills will add to these strains for the millions who were already in poverty before the pandemic. Ofgem, the energy regulator, will soon decide how much its consumer energy price cap will rise from April. With record gas prices on the wholesale market, an increase of 50% or more is expected, pushing up household bills by £700 a year, worth a combined £18bn to families. Ministers have so far shown little appetite for tackling the cost of living crisis head on. Rishi Sunak argues mitigations have already been put in place to help with higher bills, including through changes to the universal credit taper and a £500m household support fund. The chancellor also believes removing 5% of VAT on energy bills – a plan called for by Labour – is unappealing as it would permanently deprive the exchequer of revenue. However, there are hopes the government will make an announcement soon, with the smart money on ministers announcing a time-limited and targeted intervention to deal with the sharp rise. The warm homes discount (WHD) is mooted for an overhaul. However, as the Resolution Foundation has suggested, it will need to be taxpayer funded – a point that might pain the Treasury. At present, the WHD scheme works by increasing everyone’s bills to fund discounts for the neediest. Yet further pushing up gas and electricity costs is clearly an undesirable solution given the expected dramatic increase. All of this concern over cost highlights a pattern with Boris Johnson’s government: shirking big problems until they become unavoidable. With the prime minister’s authority tarnished by scandal and the Tories dipping in the polls, this tendency has the added consequence of opening up space for debate among his rivals over the best way forward. Questions are now openly raised through via newspaper leaks over a plethora of policy areas. Calls to scrap the planned 1.25 percentage point increase in national insurance are debated by cabinet members as an option to ease the cost of living squeeze, less than six months after they signed off on the plan. But as ministers jostle for contention as potential future Tory party leaders, there is a worryingly nostalgic feel to the Conservative debate; harking back to legacy ideas tried and tested over four decades. The invocation of tax cuts, deregulation, “private-good public-bad” comes as rote. The phantom of a bloated public sector squeezing the life out of the British economy is raised, while ignoring the fact that state intervention prevented a far worse reckoning during the pandemic and has grown popular after a decade of austerity. Public sector employment has risen by more than 200,000 since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, a fact leapt upon by the right wing as inherently negative. Yet the health emergency requires a small army in response, while years of cuts mean thousands more teachers, nurses, police, and civil servants are demanded. Rather than ramping up taxation to the highest levels in 70 years, backbenchers want to push for growth as an alternative, with the mood summed up by Brexit true believer Marcus Fysh urging “radical supply-side reform” – a phrase empty of substance but popular on the free market right for its invocation of the 1980s. But the shape of the state is very different to four decades ago when Margaret Thatcher came to power. Despite recent growth, the public sector remains smaller as a percentage of total employment than even two decades ago, at 17.5% compared with a peak of 22.2% in 2009 and 20% at the turn of the millennium. The main rate of corporation tax has been slashed from 52% upon Thatcher’s election in 1979 to just 19% today. The old playbook has been next to exhausted. There are clear reasons why it would do the Tories more good than harm to move on from these old debates. The party that emerged from the 2019 election is markedly different from the one before, spanning true blue shires and post-industrial towns. As Will Tanner, the former deputy head of Theresa May’s policy unit, has warned: those wanting a rerun of the 1980s forget this at their peril. Faced with the fallout from Covid-19 and a deep-rooted cost of living crisis, the solutions require a more robust state response bringing the public and private sectors together. For the model to reboot Britain from Covid-19, the Confederation of British Industry invokes not Thatcher but the 1945 Labour government. In the midst of the current pandemic turbulence and unsustainable pressure on living costs, reaching for the comfort blanket of a tried, tested, and failed rolling back of the state is the wrong response. It is time the government grasped that.",News/Business,"Free market, tax-cutting economics will not ease the UK’s cost of living squeeze",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/09/free-market-tax-cutting-economics-will-not-ease-the-uks-cost-of-living-squeeze
1/9/2022,"The most Washington website of all was forced to issue a diplomatic correction on Saturday, in a second recent iteration of perhaps the most Washington story of all: mistaken reporting about diners at Le Diplomate, a restaurant popular with DC politicos.  The website in question was Politico, the capital and Capitol-covering tipsheet which with characteristic capitals informed readers of its Playbook email: “SPOTTED: Speaker NANCY PELOSI, Senate Majority Leader CHUCK SCHUMER, Sen[ators] AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-Minn) and DICK DURBIN (D-Ill) and Justice SONIA SOTOMAYOR dining together at Le Diplomate on Friday night.” The email also offered readers a “pic from our intrepid tipster”. Alas, it did not show Sotomayor. The “pic” showed French café tables, waiters, diners and a woman turning from her dessert to talk to Klobuchar, who was maskless and sitting opposite a masked-up Durbin. Schumer’s distinctive hairline could be seen next to Durbin and Pelosi could be seen, also maskless, to the right of a dark-haired woman with her back turned: supposedly the supreme court justice. Politico might have paused before pressing send. Not only could the supposed Sotomayor’s face not be seen but only last month another supposed scandal at “Le Dip” proved to be a “le flop”. Then, a former Republican aide tweeted that Pete Buttigieg, the transportation secretary, and his husband, Chasten Buttigieg, had been turned away. In fact, they were being seated outside. Politico covered the slip, reporting: “Within minutes we at Playbook were looped into this seemingly momentous news and were pretty excited ourselves to write about it today. Alas, our enthusiasm was dashed when we heard back from a Buttigieg spox who said there was nothing to it.” On Friday, a Sotomayor sighting would have been news. One of three liberal justices on the supreme court, she had not appeared in person for oral arguments earlier, over Joe Biden’s Covid vaccine mandate for private employers. Furthermore, in that hearing she had made an inaccurate claim about the Omicron-fuelled Covid-19 surge, saying: “We have over 100,000 children, which we’ve never had before, in serious condition and many on ventilators.” As the Washington Post fact-checker put it, that was “wildly incorrect”, as “according to HHS data, as of 8 January there are about 5,000 children hospitalised … either with suspected Covid or a confirmed laboratory test”. The Politico photo also came amid continuing speculation about when or if another liberal, Stephen Breyer, might retire, thereby giving Joe Biden a pick for the court before possible loss of the Senate. Schumer would shepherd any nominee into place. Alas for Politico, it soon became clear its tipster was wrong. The woman in the picture was Iris Weinshall, the chief operating officer of the New York Public Library, who is married to Schumer. A correction ensued but to make matters worse, Weinshall was initially identified only by her husband’s name. To make matters worse still, Schumer’s office told other outlets that unlike in le grande affaire de Buttigieg, Politico had not called to check on the tip from “Le Dip”. Politico acknowledged the slip and said standards had not been met. “We deeply regret the error,” it said.",News/US news,DC media makes meal of supposed Sotomayor restaurant sighting,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/09/politico-sonia-sotomayor-dc-eatery
1/9/2022,"Joe Root hailed a “small step forward” for his injury-hit England team after they clung on for a heart-stopping draw in Sydney, nine wickets down, and avoided the ignominy of an Ashes whitewash in Australia. The rescue mission was not without casualties. Jos Buttler is set to fly home with a fractured finger while Jonny Bairstow and Ben Stokes are both doubts for Friday’s pink-ball fifth Test in Hobart due to respective thumb and side injuries picked up over the course of five gruelling days.  But on seeing Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad block out the final 12 balls in fading light, capping a 102-over rearguard that also featured a 77-minute vigil from Jack Leach at No 9 and kept the series scoreline to 3-0, Root’s previous sombre mood lifted slightly. “It’s a small step forward,” said the visibly drained England captain. “Coming into the game I spoke a lot about putting pride back into English cricket and into our Test performances. “I think the fight and the desire and the character shown here in these five days has done that in a small way. We never make it easy for ourselves, do we? But we found a way to get it done today and it was very much a team effort.” The result is unlikely to ease much of the pressure on Root, Ashley Giles – the director of cricket – and Chris Silverwood, the head coach who will rejoin the squad in Tasmania after contracting Covid-19 at the end of the Boxing Day Test. Nevertheless, a performance that included scores of 113 and 41 from Bairstow, a 19th five-wicket haul for Broad and a promising 77 from Zak Crawley on the fifth day still represented progress after the 68 all out in Melbourne that saw Australia claim the series win within 12 days. Root said: “It’s hugely important, especially on the back of the previous Test which was a really dark day for English Test cricket. It would have been easy to roll over and feel sorry for ourselves. “[But] the guys were trying to put some pride back in the badge and show how much they care about playing for England. We didn’t win the Test match and were a very long way behind the game but we found a way to get a draw and that shows the character, the pride and the desire the guys feel when they put on an England shirt.” On the injuries to Buttler, Bairstow and Stokes, the first of which could pave the way for Sam Billings’s Test debut at Bellerive Oval, Root added: “Jos won’t take any further part in the tour. It’s quite a serious injury. For him to front up as he did from the moment he took that knock shows how much it means for him to play in this Test team. “The guys could all see a number of the players hurting physically and still putting in a huge amount. In many ways it lifted the rest of the group and I’m really proud of the way they stood at times while clearly in a lot of pain, to produce for England.” Pat Cummins, meanwhile, defended a declaration 24 hours earlier that set England an improbable 388 to win or, more realistically, 109 overs to survive. Seven overs were then lost to rain on the final day, with Shane Warne saying Cummins “probably won’t sleep” stewing over the missed opportunities to go 4-0 up. Cummins said: “I’ve learned the weather forecasts are hopeless. The wicket was still not playing too many tricks and I thought if they batted really well 350 was pretty achievable out there. I thought 110 overs was enough time. They fought hard and that’s why we love the game.” On the prospect of Usman Khawaja keeping his spot in the team after making a century in both innings as a stand-in while Travis Head sat out with Covid-19, Cummins added: “I’m not a selector, but when someone comes out and hits twin hundreds, it’s pretty hard to go past them for the week after.”",Sport/Sport,‘Pride in the badge’: Root hails England’s resolve after dramatic Ashes draw,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/09/joe-root-england-ashes-fourth-test-australia-cricket
1/9/2022,"A trust founded by the Sacklers, the billionaire family accused of contributing to the US opioid crisis, gave more than £14m in its latest year of publicly recorded funding to British public bodies. One of Britain’s leading orchestras, a regional theatre and a London academy were among the beneficiaries of the family trust – which temporarily halted all donations in 2019.  The largest donation, £500,000, was received by Newbury’s Watermill theatre, followed by £280,000 which was given to the Oxford Philharmonic Orchestra Trust. The Sackler Trust announced in March 2019 that it was pausing all new giving as members of the family stood accused of helping to fuel the US opioid drug crisis. But its latest filings to Companies House on 23 December record that “new commitments” totalling £3.5m were part of £14,543,399 worth of grants in 2020. The trust has committed more than £60m since 2010 in the UK to charitable activities in medical science, the arts and other fields but has been caught up in the storm surrounding the family, members of which own Purdue Pharma. The company, which was behind the prescription painkiller OxyContin, has been facing hundreds of lawsuits in the US over its alleged role in the country’s opioid crisis, which has been killing more than 100 people a day. Major British arts institutions including the National Portrait Gallery and the Tate group of galleries are among those who said in recent years that they would return or no longer accept gift donations from the Sacklers. Members of the Sackler family who are directors of the trust include Dame Theresa Sackler. Relatives of those who have suffered in the OxyContin scandal called for her last month to be stripped of her title. As well as the Watermill theatre and the Oxford Philharmonic Orchestra Trust, other recipients were Edmonton Academy Trust, King’s College London and St Marylebone parish church in west London, all of which received £250,000. Edmonton Academy Trust said it was pleased to receive a “generous” grant from the Sackler Trust, adding: “This donation, together with others received by the trust, will be used to enhance arts facilities for children and the local community. Without this generosity, the additional facilities we will offer would not be possible.” Edelman, a public relations company representing some members of the UK-based Sackler family, declined to comment or confirm whether the latest accounts indicated a change in the trust’s policy of “pausing” new funding. A spokesperson for the Watermill theatre said it was a registered charity generating more than 80% of its own income in a normal year and support from a range of trusts, foundations, corporate partners and individuals was vital. The Sackler Trust’s support represented a continuing commitment to the theatre which equated to £125,000 a year over a four-year period, the spokesperson added, and the decision to accept the funding was considered by trustees, in line with the Watermill’s ethical policy and Charity Commission guidance. “Funding from the Sackler Trust enables the Watermill to engage children and young people through schools projects and the youth ensemble, as well as reaching people living in isolation through an annual rural tour.” A King’s College London spokesperson said that the £250,000 it received from the Sackler Trust in 2020 was a continuation of funding to support the work of Prof Declan Murphy and did not constitute a new donation. “The continuation of funds will allow for crucial work into understanding how a healthy brain develops across the lifespan to progress, transforming understanding of common disorders like ASD, ADHD, epilepsy and Down’s syndrome,” said a spokesperson. All donations accepted by King’s College London were approved by the university’s fundraising ethics review group (FERG) and had to adhere to the college’s policy for the acceptance of donations, they added.
