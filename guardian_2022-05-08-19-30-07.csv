5/8/2022,"Decades ago, the flower industry in Colombia was promoted as the replacement for another agricultural export crop, coca leaves and the cocaine made from them. The substitution was a failure – coca cultivation continues in remoter places – but a vast flower industry with its own problems has grown up in Colombia, which raises 80% of the roses sold in the US, along with many other kinds of flowers for export. The first air shipment of flowers for the US took off in 1965. The country is now the world’s second largest exporter of flowers, and the industry, which employs about 130,000 Colombians, is the leading source of jobs for women in Colombia. A similar industry in Africa feeds the European flower market. My friend and guide, union organizer Nate Miller, had written a report on the Colombian flower industry in 2017, but he had never been able to get inside one of the factories or plantations or farms or whatever the term should be for these strange places. To our surprise, I was able to talk or rather email our way into visiting one of the rose factories, or plantations, or sweatshops in 2019. Upon our arrival, we were escorted to a sort of boardroom from which you could see a lunchroom with workers already in it – most start work very early in the morning – and told a few things that confirmed that the managers here were proud of their enterprise and somehow thought that we would be impressed. And soon enough we were in one of the dozens of greenhouses. Each such structure consisted of a metal scaffolding with huge sheets of plastic attached to it, designed so that the sheets could in warm weather be opened up to let cooler air in and shut tight in cooler weather. We entered the greenhouse from a door at the center and found ourselves on a broad path to the opposite door. This was flanked on either side by rosebushes taller than my head stretching in rows to the far walls, each plant so close to the next that they made up a dense hedge in which individual plants were not readily distinguishable, each row so close to the next that anyone passing between them, as we soon did, had to sidle. The thorns were never far away. Strands of twine stretched from wooden posts held the stems in place, and there was a sense of crowding, of compression, of repetition, and almost of confusion from so many roses in so many rows stretching so far that vanishing point perspective came in and you could see roses and poles and support beams getting smaller and smaller in the distance that was still inside the plastic greenhouse. They get 104 roses a year from each square meter, our guides told me, and I saw long narrow carts in which the cut roses were laid in orderly stacks. The flowers in each row were all the same color, in various stages of openness, and the name of each variety was at the head of the row. Iron Pink. Constellation. Billabonga. Privilege. Pink Floyd. Pop Star. Billionaire. Halloween. Rejected roses and trimmings were piled up in bins. The workers have a slogan: “The lovers get the roses, but we workers get the thorns.” A rose is beautiful but a greenhouse with thousands upon thousands of roses, a place producing millions a year, with stems and leaves and petals all strewn on the floor and heaped together in bins as byproduct, was not. Insofar as these roses were beautiful, their beauty was meant to occur somewhere else, for someone else, a continent away. Some of them were grown in paper bags to protect the petals from light, and we saw a row of rosebushes whose stems culminated in brown sacks, like divas backstage with their hair in curlers. From this complex, we were told, as we paced and stopped and inspected and listened, they sent 6m roses to the US for Valentine’s Day and another 6m for Mother’s Day. Across the Colombian flower industry, those two holidays translate into enormous pressure on workers, longer hours and exhaustion. But the shipments go out almost daily year-round. Refrigerator trucks carrying four hundred boxes of roses apiece race to the airport where they’re loaded onto 747 airplanes and flown to Miami for distribution across the United States by more trucks. Each box holds 330 roses, and one 747 can hold 5,000 boxes, or 1.65m roses. The idea of an immense airplane whose sole freight was roses, burning its carbon and rushing high over the Caribbean, to deliver its burden to people who would never know of all that lay behind the roses they picked up in the supermarket, was maybe as perfect an emblem of alienation as you could find. Could roses be more uprooted? They were the invisible factories of visual pleasure. After the greenhouse came the workroom, a vast chilly structure in which roses came in from the greenhouses and went out as packaged bouquets, some already labeled with the price tag and name of the supermarket for which they were destined. It was a factory whose product happened to be roses, a rose factory. The floors were wet and leaves, thorny stems and petals were strewn across them. The workers, mostly young, mostly moving fast, wore rubber boots and gray coveralls or work shirts emblazoned with the slogans. Some wore rubber gloves as well. There were perhaps a 150 people at work in the frigid air. The roses had been grown but the bouquets were assembled on a production line like any other mass-produced product. Men rolled big carts laden with roses across the room, and other workers, male and female, unloaded the roses wrapped in mesh rectangles and, after sorting them for color, stem length, and other qualities, loaded them on to a sort of frame like a monstrous comb the length of the room. Others were busily stripping off some of the leaves, and yet others filled buckets with water and wheeled some of the the finished bouquets away to a room just above freezing where they were sorted for shipping. Some of the bouquets ended up on actual conveyer belts, emblematic structures of the Fordist factory. Later, from a former worker and labor rights activist named Beatriz Fuentes, I would learn how common repetitive motion injuries are that leave workers disabled, how the corporations prevent workers from unionizing, and other aspects of the moral ugliness of rose production. Nate had written in his report: “During peak seasons, for example the weeks and months leading up to Mother’s Day and Valentine’s Day, employees reported that work weeks can exceed 100 hours. Women, many of whom are single heads-of-households, are exposed to numerous toxic chemicals that have been linked to higher rates of birth defects.” Was the ugliness in the roses for being produced in such a way or in us for failing to see it?

5/8/2022,"Working out of the kitchen of their small restaurant in Ontario in the 1970s, Irene Demas and her husband Tony soon learned the value of trading their dishes for the talents of local bakers, craftspeople and artisans. “Everyone supported everyone back then,” said Irene, at the time a bright-eyed chef in her 20s. In exchange for daily fresh flowers, for example, the couple would take soup and a sandwich to the florist next door. And for an English painter with a predictable palate, the couple struck a deal: they would get a selection of paintings from him and his friends in exchange for grilled cheese sandwiches. By chance, that deal unwittingly netted them a painting by the acclaimed Canadian folk artist Maud Lewis – a work that nearly five decades later is expected to net more than C$35,000 (US$27,000) when it goes to auction this month. Nearly every day after it first opened, painter John Kinnear and his wife Audrey enjoyed lunch at the Villa, a restaurant run by the Demases in London, Ontario. And each day, the only meal Kinnear would ever order was a grilled cheese sandwich. “Mind you, it wasn’t just an ordinary grilled cheese. It was a great sandwich, with a five-year-old cheddar and beautiful bread,” said Irene. Demas would visit artisan bakeries each morning before the restaurant opened, selecting freshly baked loaves and a “wonderful cheddar that John just loved”. She’d slather on butter, grilling the slices of whole grain bread until crisp, all for C$2.95. But the repetitive order nonetheless frustrated Demas, who would try to coax her stubborn patron into trying new dishes and daily specials. “He never budged. He just loved that sandwich.” The first painting the couple received from Kinnear was a watercolour of Jumbo, a famous elephant who was hit and killed by a train in the town of St Thomas, Ontario. One day, Kinnear came in with a selection of new paintings. Demas emerged from the kitchen and saw half a dozen pieces propped up on the tables and chairs of the restaurant. “I just sat there in silence for quite a while. I’d never ever seen any art like that before. At first I thought they might be playing or some sort of trick on me,” she said of the bright colours and simple content of the works. “Did a kid do some of these?” Kinnear told the couple of an artist he’d met out in the province of Nova Scotia, a woman who was “so poor she didn’t have the right things to paint on”, resorting instead to scraps of wood and the leftover paint fishermen used on their boats. “He felt sorry for her,” said Demas. Kinnear sent Lewis some boards prepped for painting, a handful of which she returned to him with completed works. Of the selection that day, the only painting that stood out to Demas was one of a black truck. She was pregnant at the time and thought the scene might look nice on her son’s wall, where it has remained until now. Lewis, who lived most of her life in poverty, was known for her cheery paintings of life in rural Nova Scotia. She often repeated themes, including cats and ice skaters. “I put the same things in, I never change,” she told a documentary crew in 1965. She painted nearly every inch of the one-room house she shared with her husband, Everett, including the couple’s stove. Lewis’s output dropped in the final years of her life as she developed rheumatoid arthritis. She died in 1970 at age 69. In the years since, her fame has grown widely and her works increasingly fetch tens of thousands of dollars. A 2013 biopic has only renewed interest and excitement around the unconventional paintings. “It’s just too bad she didn’t live long enough to really reap the benefits of her art,” said Demas. With the encouragement of their children, the couple have decided to put the work up for sale, as well as three pieces of correspondence between Kinnear and Lewis, in which she thanks him for his sustained generosity. “My husband’s 90 and I don’t think I have another 50 years to hang on to it,” she said. “The kids are saying, use the money and travel and just enjoy life.”",News/World news,Painting swapped in 70s for grilled cheese sandwich serves up windfall,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/08/painting-swapped-grilled-cheese-sandwich-canada-maud-lewis
5/8/2022,"It’s 52 years since Tina Ramirez founded Ballet Hispánico in New York as a haven for marginalised Latinx artists. Now it’s the largest Latinx cultural organisation in the US, run by Cuban American Eduardo Vilaro, but surprisingly making it’s very first appearance on an English stage as part of Leicester’s Let’s Dance International Frontiers festival. Despite the name, this is actually a versatile troupe of contemporary dancers also drawing on Latin, jazz and ballet. This triple bill can only serve as a taster to their extensive rep, but it suggests a company with a proud sense of heritage, and an accessible approach to dance, questioning identity and society with bite and humour. The choreographer on the bill best known to British audiences is Annabelle Lopez Ochoa, who’s previously made a Frida Kahlo work for English National Ballet and A Streetcar Named Desire for Scottish Ballet. She’s a strong dancemaker with often a feminist spin. Her piece here is Tiburones, which means “Sharks”, tackling representation of Puerto Ricans in the media (Ochoa herself is half-Colombian). Sounds heavy, but it’s not. The title is just one nod to West Side Story, probably the most famous depiction of Puerto Ricans on screen. She gives us finger clicks and 50s style alongside tropes of hyper-machismo and super-sexy women, but different pictures break through – two men in a tender duet, men catwalking and vogueing in heels (the Latinx community were a big part of New York’s ballroom scene) and, ultimately, emancipation from the tyranny of the white male gaze. Con Brazos Abiertos by Michelle Manzanales takes a different country – Mexico – and explores some similar themes, the cliches of Mexican culture in American eyes: saturated colours, a sombrero routine, a Cheech and Chong skit. You get a sense of Manzanales’s awkwardness stuck between cultures, but via thoughtful solos, that grows to dignity and self-actualisation. You connect with the central character, although choreographically it stays pretty safe. The most interesting movement comes in Gustavo Ramírez Sansano’s 18+1: busy staccato semaphore, cartoonish, meticulously organised gestures, tight to the rhythms of the cheery mambo music of Perez Prado. An upbeat end to an enjoyable debut.",Arts/Stage,"Ballet Hispánico review – Latinx bite, humour and vogueing in heels",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/08/ballet-hispanico-review-curve-leicester-latinx-bite-humour-and-vogueing-in-heels
5/8/2022,"Draped in deerskins, armed with a roughly hewn axe and a bow, Martin (Rasmus Bjerg) is at one with the land. He appreciatively sniffs a handful of what looks suspiciously like faeces, scans the undergrowth, before looming over his prey. He is, in his mind at least, a mighty hunter. The score, an urgent, muscular battle cry on sawing double bass, agrees with him. But his prey is a small frog, and Martin’s attempts to live on the land are doomed by the fact that he is an ordinary suburban father of two in the throes of the mother of all midlife crises. Martin’s adventure in the mountains of Norway takes a new direction when he teams up with Musa (Zaki Youssef), an injured criminal on the run from the cops and his former partners. Martin also finds himself on the wrong side of the law after a botched attempt at bartering, followed by a raid on a Viking village (he steals a catering pack of bread rolls). What makes this amiably amusing Danish comedy work is the fact that it takes its hapless protagonist almost as seriously as he takes himself. And while Martin’s tragicomic plight is the central focus, director Thomas Daneskov and co-writer Morten Pape take an unusual degree of care with the fleshed-out supporting characters, particularly Martin’s longsuffering wife, Anne (The Killing’s Sofie Gråbøl), who wrangles two emotional children and a husband who would rather live on lichen than deal with his marital issues.",Arts/Film,Wild Men review – Danish dad seeks his inner Viking in midlife crisis comedy,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/08/wild-men-review-danish-dad-seeks-his-inner-viking-in-midlife-crisis-comedy
5/8/2022,"“Now that I’m dead… ” begins the murdered narrator of Steve Toltz’s new book, whose chapters alternate between the afterlife and a near-future Sydney beset by “drone terrorism, nanobot murders, hurricane firestorms and utter global chaos”. The Covid era, known as “the Fattening” (“all that gruelling isolation and silly panic buying and overeating… The only thing we learned was how to hide from deliverymen”), has given way to a new pandemic, K9, spread by dogs. When the news seems like a novel, you may as well play loud, but I’m not sure Toltz knows any other way. The salty explorations of masculinity in his previous books, A Fraction of the Whole (shortlisted for the Booker in 2008) and Quicksand, sometimes resembled being stuck in a lift with an aspiring standup. While the intricate concept behind Here Goes Nothing hints at newfound discipline, the scattershot result suggests he’s still figuring out how to make his routines amount to more than the sum of their parts, which isn’t to say there isn’t fun to be had en route. The crazier the story, the greater the need for something humdrum to anchor the reader; it’s a basic rule of thumb, but Toltz prefers the rule of the middle finger, pairing a wild backdrop with an equally wild plot. The middle-aged protagonist, Angus, once a violent mugger, now happily married to Gracie, an internet-addicted wedding celebrant, has gone straight, or at least straight-ish, stealing only in order to fund their IVF treatment, an overwhelming expense that leaves them prey to the malevolent schemes of a terminally ill stranger, Owen, who turns up asking for a bed in exchange for a place in his will. Angus toggles between this madcap houseguest drama and his subsequent interdimensional shenanigans in the afterlife, satirically portrayed as a bureaucratic dystopia facing a refugee crisis prompted by the K9 death toll. Plus ça change seems a damp outcome to all the pyrotechnics, but you sense Toltz feels he’s found his calling amid the ongoing panic over millennial sensitivities. “Why were so many people boasting that vulnerability was their only accreditation?” Gracie wonders after an internet spat over her failure to acknowledge someone’s “lived experience”; Toltz mentions a news item about “a white amputee who had 3D-printed a black hand for his at-home transplant surgery”, a moment that more or less sums up a book that relentlessly digs us in the ribs, sniggering in our ears. Trouble is, these instincts ill serve Toltz’s tricksy scenario. When Angus explains at length how the dead are reborn free of disease (“all tangled nerves were straightened, all spleens unruptured, all prolapsed anuses reverted to their inverse state”), Toltz has to suddenly remember that Angus is meant to be a stranger in his new world, not a guide (“I’m not saying I understood everything”). The book’s grip on characterisation similarly dissolves in the soupy rancour of its default tone. “The gigantic cunt who was my father died on his favourite stool in his favourite pub and it was the most delightful fucking day of my entire life,” says Owen. “In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is a cunt,” declares Gracie. “Can you stop being a monstrous cunt for just a minute?” asks Angus. Yes, there are diverting set-pieces, not least when Gracie gives herself a C-section, but so much is flung at the narrative that little of it seems to matter, which wouldn’t be a problem had Toltz not banked on us caring about the apocalyptic climax. The effect, overall, is weirdly akin to a cross between a Lionel Shriver novel and JM Coetzee’s The Childhood of Jesus, which is maybe only a way of saying that Steve Toltz has a voice all his own – and boy, doesn’t he just love it.

5/8/2022,"Roses, hollyhocks and an immaculate green lawn have always exemplified a typical British garden in summer. But now, as gardeners look forward to a mini-heatwave this month, demand for heat-loving and drought-resistant plants has never been higher in the UK. From grapevines and tropical banana plants to exotic palm trees, hibiscus, lavender and hardy succulents, gardeners are snapping up non-native flora that can survive – and even thrive – in Britain’s warming climate. Data compiled by the Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) for the Observer suggests searches for drought-tolerant plants in the UK increased by 490% between 2014 and 2021. The Mediterranean plant lavender, which can easily tolerate a long, dry summer, has replaced roses as the bestselling plant group in the UK, said Boyd Douglas-Davies, president of the HTA and director of British Garden Centres, a group of 58 retailers. “Lavender, consistently now, is the no 1 seller.” Flowering hibiscus and santolina from Portugal and southern Spain are also much more common nowadays, he said, reflecting a shift towards a more Mediterranean style of gardening. Some are even daring to attempt a Caribbean vibe. “We’re seeing more and more tropical plants like banana plants being sold to go into British gardens,” said Douglas-Davies. Ten years ago, he had not seen even a single banana plant being sold in the UK. “But now, every summer, garden centres around the country will be selling them.” His garden centres are also selling lots of hardy outdoor palm trees like cordylines, he said. “A few years ago, we would have probably said to customers that it needs to be in a sheltered position, or you need to wrap it in the winter to protect it. That’s far less of a conversation these days.” Large palms, which cost £200 to £400, are selling particularly well, which Douglas-Davies thinks shows how British gardeners have embraced heat-loving plants more broadly in their gardens. “If you’re buying a palm that big – six or seven feet tall – that’s creating a style and statement in your garden, which has the look of a climate south of the UK.” The prices gardeners are willing to pay displays their confidence that these plants will thrive outdoors in the UK as weather patterns change. “Palms are tough. They will take the dry heat of the summer and the cold of the winter – you don’t really have to do anything with them once they’re established.” Gravel gardens are also gaining popularity – and for good reason, said Guy Barter, chief horticulturist at the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS). “If you’ve got a dry, sunny spot, turf is always hard work. You might have to water it or it will go brown in the summer.” A gravel garden is much lower maintenance by comparison, he said, and popular plants like rosemary, cistus, succulents and lavender will thrive there even during a hosepipe ban: “Plants that grow well under gravel are ones that don’t need watering once they are established.” The UK’s warming climate means the average growing season in the UK lasts 29 days longer than it did between 1961 and 1990, according to the Met Office. The RHS is seeing evidence of gardeners growing vegetables and fruit that used to be close to impossible in the past. For example, grapevines have been planted more widely in the UK as the climate has warmed, the growing season has lengthened and autumn in particular has become more temperate. “Grapes are fantastically hardy in Britain, whatever the summer is like,” Barter said. “But originally they would have been vulnerable to bad weather at either end of the growing season.” Similarly, he has noticed kitchen gardeners successfully growing crops like sweetcorn and winter squash – which take a long time to mature – further and further north in the UK. “Where at one time we were restricted to carrots and beetroot, we’ve now got these crops that are more or less subtropical.” In Surrey, he is “boldly” attempting to grow sweet potatoes outdoors this year. “Twenty years ago, you wouldn’t dream of putting a sweet potato outdoors, it wouldn’t have had a chance. But now, in the hot summer in the south, you can get fair results.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Greenhouse effect: Palms and lavender replace hollyhocks in British gardens,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/08/greenhouse-effect-palms-and-lavender-replace-hollyhocks-in-british-gardens

5/8/2022,"His late mother derisively called him “one eye”. He keeps cocaine in a jar. He wrote on a wall in blood with a severed finger, and his ex-wife Amber Heard thought it’d be funny if she pooped in their bed and blamed it on the dogs. These are some of the sordid details about Johnny Depp that have been “spread on the world like peanut butter” (his words) since the actor’s defamation trial began unfolding on live TV last month. Depp (who claims to be broke) is seeking $50m from Heard, whose 2018 Washington Post op-ed, he alleges, obliquely and intentionally characterizes him as a physically abusive spouse – an explosive charge that he further argues has cost him $40m in lost wages and put him in league with a vast rogue’s gallery of high-profile Hollywood men canceled by the #MeToo movement. But money isn’t the point here. Reputation is. That Depp, a top earning A-lister and famously private before all this, chose to air all of his dirty laundry – the surreptitious recordings, the ribald texts, the prolific substance abuse – simply to remove the stain of #MeToo from his person at the very least shows how deeply committed he is to restoring his good name. No doubt, Depp risks overexposure by untangling his mess of a personal life for wider consumption. So why is he putting himself through such intense scrutiny? Well, for four decades he’s established himself as a fallible star who isn’t easily embarrassed. In court, he doesn’t have to worry about his side of the story being condensed for space, clarity or context. With help from his legal team, Depp can take his time stippling a narrative that rings true to his ear and resonates with skeptics. In these modern times, snarky as it seems, there’s really no such thing as too much information. Depp might feel he caught a major break when Fairfax county judge Penney Azcarate (Fairfax is where the online edition of the Post, which ran Heard’s op-ed, is published) allowed Court TV to broadcast this tragic affair, effectively setting an actual stage for one of the best actors of his generation to play to the camera and milk his closeups. Perhaps he thinks he can pull off the role of a lifetime. As PR moves go, this isn’t just an extreme gambit for Depp. It’s the Hollywood equivalent of a nuclear bombing run, with no guarantees that anyone involved will emerge unscathed. Yet here he is smashing the self-destruct button. And, interestingly, he’s not the only one exploiting the nuclear option. While he was battling it out with Heard in Fairfax, former reality TV star Blac Chyna was leveling a $100m defamation lawsuit in Los Angeles against the Kardashian family, alleging that sisters Kim Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian, Kylie Jenner and mother Kris Jenner conspired to break up Chyna’s marriage to Rob Kardashian, which Chyna alleges resulted in the cancelation of their E! network reality show, Rob & Chyna. This Kardashian production was (mercifully) not televised, but both sides seemed reliant on the guarantee of press surrounding the case to redeem or uphold their reputations. That proceeding brought forth tales of Chyna holding a gun to Rob Kardashian’s head, wrapping a phone charging cord around his neck and beating him with a metal rod – all gags, she testified. But the jury wasn’t amused and ruled for the Kardashians, leaving Chyna’s reputation in even smaller tatters. Gone are the days when celebrities washed away their stains in soft-focus network TV interviews. It used to be that when a celebrity’s brand was suffering, they sat down with Barbara Walters, Oprah Winfrey, Katie Couric or Diane Sawyer and over the course of an hour or so on their home turf, calmly answered pre-vetted questions explaining what exactly the world had gotten so wrong about them. But with Walters retired, Sawyer MIA, and Winfrey and Couric not really doing reputation rehab any more, only Gayle King is left as the last sympathetic ear on network TV. And she barely has the airtime or the patience for wayward personalities. The glossy print interview, too, was once a viable outlet for image repair; Depp has been down that well time and again. In 2018 he invited British GQ to his lavish home in the south of France to refute Heard’s domestic violence allegations. But the 8,000-word cover story, which called him an “outlaw”, was roundly criticized for glamorizing domestic abuse. When all else fails, social media is another image repair tool. But it hardly has the nuance or the bandwidth to reckon with an affair as complicated as the doomed one between Depp and Heard. At a glance, the court system wouldn’t seem any better equipped to redeem Depp, especially in light of how decisively he lost his 2020 libel lawsuit against the Sun when he sued the British newspaper for calling him a “wife beater”. But where that trial unfolded behind closed doors, this one has played out on Court TV four days a week for the past three weeks (it’s expected to go three more). Depp and his attorneys have been accorded great swathes of daylight hours to cast the one-time sex symbol as a deeply wounded child of abuse who’d sooner run and hide than strike a woman, and the backdrop and formalities of the courtroom to vouch for his authenticity. Viewers have been introduced to a coterie of business associates who look out for Depp and speak to his fundamental good nature. They’ve seen the carnival-like atmosphere at the Fairfax county courthouse – complete with alpacas and Depp fans camping out overnight to secure a spot in the gallery; one day of testimony was nearly interrupted when a galley member’s phone broke out into the Pirates of the Caribbean-themed ringtone. As these images have beamed across the world, the hashtags #justiceforjohnny and #istandwithjohnny have gotten more traction. Each new wave of support for Depp would seem to give studios cover to hire him again, regardless of the trial outcome. Meanwhile, Heard, who risks losing her role in the Aquaman franchise and future work if indeed she’s the one found to have been physically abusive, recently sacked her PR team and moved to have Depp’s lawsuit dismissed. Obviously, it’s still early days. Heard has only just taken the stand Wednesday and already accused Depp of grooming her as they filmed The Rum Diaries, and cried through recollections of alleged slaps and kicks and Depp supposedly breaking her nose after the 2014 Met Gala. But for now his nuclear lawsuit appears to be doing the job of restoring his good name in the eyes of his fans and proving that the only way out of crisis is through.",Arts/Film,Depp-Heard trial: are court streams the new celebrity sit-down interview?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/08/court-livestream-celebrity-sit-down-interview-johnny-depp-trial
5/8/2022,"Being cynical about other people’s motivations – assuming that everyone acts only out of self-interest – is all the rage these days. But, let’s be honest, people who are universally cynical are also tiresome and dull. No one wants a colleague, let alone a friend, who can’t really trust you because they think everyone’s out for themselves. Excellent ammunition for tackling this epidemic of cynicism comes via great new research that examines the perceived and actual competence of people who are more or less cynical. It finds there’s a reason people might be cynical – it makes other people think you’re clever (people think a cynical person will outperform a non-cynical one in a range of cognitive tasks). That broadly fits with the common story about us equating cynicism with wisdom or hard-won experience. But the more interesting finding, including from a survey of 200,000 people across 30 countries, is that our faith in the competence of cynics is misplaced. They do worse on measures of cognitive ability or academic competence. The author calls this excessive faith “the Cynical Genius Illusion” and it’s something we need to break. It’s also important for the cynics themselves that we do. Other studies show that being cynical is bad for your health, reduces your self-esteem and leads to lower earnings. So it’s just bad all round, really. In the end, we’re humans and being successful in any meaningful part of our lives requires cooperation with other people. It shouldn’t be rocket science that if your starting point is not to trust anyone, you’re missing a major building block required for leading a good life. So let’s cancel the cynicism.

5/8/2022,"Solving an appalling crime is one thing, understanding why it happened quite another. This year British television drama looks set to be dominated by the desire to explain real evil. Betting on a public thirst for in-depth treatments of true crime stories, a string of high-profile television dramas about murder and abuse are being made. Killing, violence and psychopathic cruelty may once have been the preserve of cheaply made shockers, but the criminal mind now fascinates our most successful screenwriters and leading actors. “It is less about inhumanity than it is about humanity,” says award-winning playwright James Graham, who is about to bring a murder case to TV. “The power of drama to make sense of the traumatic or the nonsensical has always, to me, been a vital function.” Graham has written Sherwood, a six-part series on BBC One this summer that uses real murders committed in the Nottinghamshire of his youth as the basis for a fictional story. Meanwhile, Sky’s current drama The Staircase, starring Colin Firth and Toni Collette, revisits the trial of American novelist Michael Peterson, suspected of murdering his wife Kathleen, which was the subject of a hit documentary in 2004. Sarah Phelps, creator of A Very British Scandal, is tackling the murder carried out by former Buckinghamshire church warden Benjamin Field in 2015. A new drama about the Northumbrian killer Raoul Moat has also just started filming, while Steve Coogan’s portrayal of Jimmy Savile, The Reckoning, will soon be broadcast on BBC One. “In every horrific crime story, there’s usually a moment of goodness or redemption which might just be the act of bringing a criminal to justice,” said Graham. “In Sherwood, it’s about how a community rife with political tensions can heal some of those wounds through a tragic murder and manhunt case.” The dark focus of this lineup of entertainment follows the success this year of the three-part BBC serial killer drama Four Lives, examining the police mistakes that allowed Stephen Port to keep committing murder, and last month’s ITV hit, The Thief, His Wife and the Canoe, writer Chris Lang’s account of the outlandish fraud perpetrated by John Darwin in the resort of Seaton Carew in 2002. “There is an even greater appetite for true-crime drama now,” said David Nath, executive producer of The Thief, His Wife and the Canoe, as well as Deceit, last year’s Channel 4 series about the police “honeytrap” set up in an attempt to incriminate the suspected killer of Rachel Nickell in Wimbledon in 1992. “It’s a demand for true crime that was being met by documentary.” Other recent popular dramas have portrayed some of Britain’s most brutal murderers, including David Tennant as serial killer Dennis Nilsen in Des, a three-part drama shown on ITV two years ago, and Jeff Pope’s powerful study of the police investigation into the 2011 death of Sian O’Callaghan in Swindon, A Confession, shown on ITV in 2019. “True-crime drama is becoming a bigger thing, and Jeff Pope has been commanding this territory for some time in the UK. But programme-makers still need to think about what is the best form for each story,” said Nath. Pope’s 2014 drama The Widower, a hit ITV series in which Reece Shearsmith played murderous nurse Malcolm Webster, may have set the trend. But Pope is aware of how the genre has boomed. “Probably there is too much crime drama,” he told the Observer before the broadcast of A Confession. “But you can’t force yourself to unlike it. All you can do is make the best one you can.” The key, he believes, is making a drama about something more than the crime. “I never want to do anything ghoulish. I always take an angle into it.” Nath agrees: “Just because it is an interesting story it doesn’t make it the right fit for a drama. There is a huge responsibility in revisiting the story from the past, something that was really painful.” The decision to re-enact serious real crimes for the public has provoked angry responses from some of those involved. The family of one of Nilsen’s victims questioned the need for ITV to screen Des, while the fresh decisions to portray Moat and Savile have also been accused of tastelessness. Speaking on the BBC’s The One Show this spring, Coogan admitted he had found playing Savile “heavy” and a “dark thing”. But he has also defended the drama, saying it will “vindicate itself” when it is broadcast. Graham, in contrast, is drawing on memories of the impact of a murder in the village where he grew up, but names have been changed. “It’s an ex-mining village where the scars left by the clash with the Met police during the strike are still very emotive. And here was a crime that bought that same force back into the community decades later – only this time to catch a killer.” He describes Sherwood as “a strange hybrid, in that it isn’t a literal adaptation of a real life story – more of a way for me to explore the themes and the anxieties and the character of a community.” Nath, whose company Story Films also makes crime documentaries, said the question of good taste comes up all the time. “The amount you can alter the tone is limited by the nature of the true story. With Deceit, I was constantly thinking about the people who remain victims and how they would respond. That was inseparable to the way we developed it.” He is also about to bring out a new fictional drama, although one based closely on real incidents of witness intimidation. Called Witness No 3, it will go out on Channel 5. The big ratings for the BBC’s 2020 drama The Salisbury Poisonings, and ITV’s true murder series White House Farm, along with Des, are thought to have persuaded commissioning editors on major British channels that primetime drama audiences have strong stomachs. And Netflix’s diet of popular true crime has developed a viewing habit. Graham, who also wrote Quiz, the hit gameshow drama, said he had faith that “it is possible to explore political and social issues while making a popular, compelling thriller”. “These are often stories about people, communities or institutions under the most amount of stress, which is an opportunity to better understand them,” he said.",Arts/Television & radio,TV takes a dark turn as true crime is turned into primetime drama,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/08/tv-takes-a-dark-turn-as-true-is-turned-into-primetime-drama
5/8/2022,"It is five years since David Eldridge started his dramatic dissection of the lives of couples. Beginning showed a man and woman in their 20s gradually, unexpectedly coming together in a dishevelled room. Middle, the second play in a trilogy, takes a different heterosexual pair, together for nearly two decades, falling apart in a plush house. Or are they? Polly Findlay’s production is a subtle plait of the overstated and the unsaid. The opening dialogue is bald – too forthright to be altogether convincing. A wife (floating dressing gown) tells her husband (West Ham PJs) she no longer loves him. She wants to talk; he wants to get a joint of pork in the oven. She unfolds her buried discontent: the hard end of childcare, the not being listened to, the lack of brain life. He sniffs. Just as this begins to look programmatic – like a male playwright trying too hard to make a woman’s case – hubby turns. He is less posh and less voluble than his wife: “Am I just a geezer then?” The real motor of the evening is the disappointment and the desire (neither really knows for what) behind the dialogue, terrifically performed by Claire Rushbrook and Daniel Ryan: she resolutely sad; he twitchily chirpy. The more she wants to spill her beans, the more he recoils; the more he thinks things can be fixed by adding “bits and bobs” to their sexual exchanges, the more hope drains from Rushbrook’s face. Fly Davis’s gleaming design – every memory pinned down in a photo – suggests the weight and glue of a shared history. Rushbrook pours milk from a saucepan into a mug with the resignation of someone making an habitual task into an occupation. Rushbrook and Ryan approach but never quite touch each other. When they move as if to embrace or comfort each other they leave a gap between their bodies, as if another couple were standing between them, hugging. The thing no telly prepares you for is the way an actor moves across the stage, taking charge of whatever space is around; there are no edits when the action is live. Jodie Comer’s face has become familiar from Killing Eve – razor-keen, inscrutable. Much of the excitement in Justin Martin’s sleek production of Prima Facie is the way Comer leaps and scythes, up and down, from side to side of the stage, as if in imitation of her mental attack as a sharp defence barrister. Miriam Buether’s design – looming walls stacked with files containing legal notes – is all black and white, like a lawyer’s suit. It ingeniously projects the clear-cut, adversarial legal definition of truth against which Suzie Miller’s play is punching. Her torrential monologue begins by looking at rape as a case study, moves into the lawyer’s personal experience and ends by denouncing legal procedures and assumptions as incapable of dealing with the human situations in which sexual assaults most often occur. The argument is strongly made and forcefully delivered, though not all of it requires Comer’s skill. The more unusual parts of the evening touch on the double disadvantage in law of being female and not coming from a grand (that’s to say, moneyed) background. Comer uses a Liverpool accent (her own) and brings warmly to life the mother who turns up with a beach bag for a suitcase and makes jam sandwiches. Incidentally, jam and bread are having a playwriting moment: only last week David Eldridge announced them as a true sign of class division. Swarming all over the stage, ivy makes the Globe’s pillars seem to bear fresh growth. Joanna Parker’s design tips us the wink. Lucy Bailey’s light-footed, meticulously considered production of Much Ado About Nothing bursts with new life. Set in the 40s, in an Italy ready to frolic but still shaking from the grip of fascism, it is full of verbal and visual colour: shimmering satin gowns, an orange scooter, and accordion music, breezy and wistful, weaving throughout the action. Making full use of the Globe’s capacity to engage directly with its audience, Bailey’s show is buoyant with slapstick and teases: Dogberry, the comic policeman, threatens to skid into the groundlings on his bike. George Fouracres is glorious in the part, the verbal absurdities tumbling out with an edge of pathos. He is measured, watchful, solemn, bouncing the verse like a bobby bouncing on his toes. All the men – including Ralph Davis’s finely bewildered Benedick – look slow-witted in comparison to the women. The transfixing Katy Stephens – her part gender-switched – is crucial to the success. Powerful, beautifully voiced, she is at once defiant and mercurial as governor Leonata. As Beatrice, Lucy Phelps spills over with words and exuberance. She is driven not by crabbedness nor self-conscious wit but by merriment: she slips around the stage like a madcap schoolgirl. Bailey’s central triumph is to feminise the play. Those accordionists are women. Tablecloths are snapped into the air, as if to say: farewell to war; now let us feast.

5/8/2022,"The ancient Greek city of Paestum, on Italy’s south-west coast, is hardly discreet – its temples are glaringly obvious for all to see. Yet it was only “rediscovered” in the mid-18th century thanks to the grand tour, when the sons of aristocrats from across Europe, though mostly Britain, visited southern European cultural sites as part of their education. Now its majestic temples have a new guardian – a 38-year-old from Milan. Tiziana D’Angelo is one of the youngest people to direct a big Italian cultural site and is among the few female directors. “You would expect a very serious and composed reaction but the first thing I did was scream,” she said on being told she had got the job. “Then came tears of joy.” The first time she set eyes on Paestum, famous for its three Doric temples, dating from about 600 to 450BC, was as a child when visiting the site with her family. Her studies brought her back in 2012 to conduct research on the funerary paintings that adorned hundreds of tombs, dating from the Greek to the Lucanian and Roman eras. These were excavated in Paestum and necropolises in the surrounding area, and she studied them as part of her doctorate at Harvard University. “I returned periodically and collaborated with Gabriel Zuchtriegel [the former director] on exhibitions, and so I maintained a relationship with the site,” said D’Angelo, who has also studied at Oxford and Cambridge, and until a few weeks ago was an assistant professor at Nottingham University. “But never would I have imagined that one day I would come back here as director. It’s a dream.” Paestum, located in the Cilento area of Italy’s Campania region, is often overshadowed by the more popular Pompeii and Herculaneum. Even more low-profile is nearby Velia, where the Greek philosopher Parmenides was born, which along with Paestum formed part of Magna Graecia, the name of the southern Italian coastal areas colonised by the Greeks. The management of the two sites was merged in early 2020. Founded in about 600BC, Paestum was originally called Poseidonia, from Poseidon, or Neptune, the god of the sea, to whom the city was dedicated. It was later conquered by the Lucanians and then the Romans, although D’Angelo said the transitions were gradual. “You have to think that these people coexisted. They negotiated space and power, and there is archaeological evidence of this: for example, the funerary paintings allow you to reconstruct this much more complex context,” she added. Paestum’s walls and amphitheatre remain mostly intact, but it was only in the second half of the 20th century, when excavations began in earnest, that hundreds of painted graves were found in and around the area, including the Tomb of the Diver – the only one dating back to the Greek period. Discovered in a small cemetery in the late 1960s by the noted archaeologist Mario Napoli, its huge grave ledger depicts a naked man diving into the sea, said to be a metaphor of the transition from life to death. Other slabs from the tomb depict scenes of a banquet and homosexual love. The tomb is among those housed at Paestum’s museum, and about 400 are currently held in a warehouse that D’Angelo plans to periodically open to the public. The majority date to the Lucanian period. “You might think these paintings were just a commemoration of the dead, but they were part of the funerary process, as they were actually painted during the ceremony,” she said. Other treasures found at Paestum include various pottery, weapons and ancient Greek homes. Over in Velia, founded by Phocaean Greek colonists who made their way to southern Italy after their victory in a sixth-century naval battle over the Etruscans and their Carthaginian allies off the coast of Corsica, the most recent discovery was two warrior helmets believed to have originated from the battle, one taken from the enemy. Also found were vases and the remains of a temple dedicated to the goddess Athena. “They built temples that contained Greek weapons but we also found evidence of Etruscan weapons, which tells us they also dedicated the weapons of their enemies to Athena,” said D’Angelo. She plans to consolidate the two parks, including establishing a bus link between them. In Velia, work is under way to make a former railway tunnel, currently serving as a warehouse for the site’s treasures, accessible to the public. A museum is planned at Velia, while more space will open at Paestum’s museum this year. The Easter weekend was D’Angelo’s first as director, and there was a record number of visitors, a sign that she could be in for a busy time. “I am grateful to all who made this opportunity possible, not only the director general who chose me, but my parents and the teachers at high school who made me passionate about the ancient world and art, and my supervisors and colleagues at the various museums I worked at,” she said.",News/World news,‘I wept with joy’: young director made guardian of Italy’s temples of Paestum ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/08/i-wept-with-joy-young-director-made-guardian-of-italys-temples-of-paestum
5/8/2022,"What a pleasure it is to come across new words. Take kenning, which I encountered while reading an essay on medieval literature: “A figure of speech in the type of circumlocution, a compound that employs figurative language in place of a more concrete single-word noun.” An example is wave-floater, meaning a ship. Other recent discoveries, thanks to the Great Big Dialect Hunt website, include flittermouse (a bat), bishy barnabee (an East Anglian dialect word for a ladybird) and docky (another East Anglian term, for lunch). All good, though I think the prize has to go leggit. This arose from an article about a demonstration at Eton over fears that its 164-year-old hunting society could be scrapped. Apparently, the pupils are up in arms over plans to ditch the college’s beagling pack. And how do they show their displeasure? Well, the pupils gather in the main courtyard until the headmaster arrives to face them, at which point one boy shouts “leggit” and they all take to their heels. History doesn’t relate the outcome of this protest, but I’m glad to have made the word’s acquaintance. It’s no sillier, after all, than many other things that have emerged from that establishment in recent years. Now, I hope you’re feeling dextrous, because I would like you to unravel the following (from a breathless press release): “We’re at a pivotal inflection point as virtual worlds gain mainstream acceptance, and it’s vital that we establish strong, cultural standards from the ground up, with acceptance and accessibility at their core. Digital fashion is already an enormous business, and has the potential to surpass physical fashion as users increasingly flock to metaverse worlds. Digital fashion is more sustainable, scalable, and infinitely creative versus physical fashion.” Give up? Well, that makes two of us.
