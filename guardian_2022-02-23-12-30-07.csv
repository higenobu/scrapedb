2/23/2022,"Joe Biden’s warning that Russia is beginning to invade Ukraine, and the debate over the severity of the west’s sanctions on Moscow, grips today’s front pages. The Times says “West imposes sanctions as Biden warns of war” and carries an image of Russian troops and tanks in the Rostov region, close to the border with Ukraine. It reports the US president’s comment that Russia’s military is moving blood supplies to the border, and disquiet among some senior Tory figures over the extent of the UK sanctions.  The Express takes a more critical stance of UK sanctions. The headline is: “Punish Putin harder now”. It says Boris Johnson has been urged to move swiftly to punish up to 150 oligarchs linked to Vladimir Putin or face a “global catastrophe”. The Mirror agrees, saying “Get dirty Russian money out of UK now”. It calls the UK sanctions “feeble” and says MPs and activists are urging more effort to halt Russian money laundering in the UK. Metro says “We’ll grab him by the roubles”, alongside cutout images of the prime minister and Putin. It carries a hint of discontent at the extent of the sanctions but is broadly positive about the “first barrage” of measures. The Guardian focuses on the latest developments abroad, with the headline: “Threat of war grows as Putin backs Ukraine proxy states” and a huge image of Russian tanks ploughing through the mud close to Ukraine’s border. It gives prominence to Biden’s comments and Germany’s decision to put the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia on hold. The Telegraph gives the US president the headline – “Putin is invading and will go much further, says Biden” – and Johnson the main image. It notes the potential for millions to suffer as a result of the invasion, Nord Stream 2 and Putin expanding Moscow’s claims beyond Russian-controlled territories in east Ukraine. The Mail takes a more visceral approach with “Twisted Putin is ready for bloodshed”. It notes Russian tank movements and says 100 Nato jets are on alert. The FT concentrates on the growing risk of war after Putin recognised expanded territorial claims beyond areas already under Russian control in Ukraine. The headline is: “Putin backs separatist claims to whole Donbas region of Ukraine”. “Putin takes Europe to brink of war”, says the i, with bullet points on the west’s sanctions packages and growing fears of a full-scale invasion. The Sun reports that the UK is posed to send more weapons to Ukraine and Johnson’s comments about Putin’s “illogical and irrational frame of mind”. The headline is: Boris: stop mad Vlad”.",News/Media,‘Grab him by the roubles’: How the papers covered the threat of war in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/23/grab-him-by-the-roubles-how-the-papers-covered-the-threat-of-war-in-ukraine
2/23/2022,"The Vanuatu government has launched an inquiry into the country’s labour mobility programs, including the seasonal worker program in Australia, citing concerns around safety. The inquiry comes in the wake of testimony from Vanuatu seasonal workers in Australia to a parliamentary hearing earlier this month, in which they alleged they had experienced bullying, exploitative working conditions, poor housing arrangements and lack of support services while under the scheme.  Australia’s Pacific labour mobility initiatives – the Seasonal Worker Programme (SWP) and Pacific Labour Scheme (PLS) – support Pacific and Timorese workers to take up jobs in rural and regional Australia, particularly in the agricultural sector. There are roughly 4,500 Vanuatu workers in Australia under the scheme based on the 2019 and 2020 numbers by the Vanuatu government. One Vanuatu citizen said that while working on the scheme he had received just $100 a week and had had $30 a week deducted from that amount, with no explanation of what the deductions were for, which led to the Australian senator Matt Canavan calling the scheme “tantamount to slavery”. Others, such as Stephen Howes, the director of the Development Policy Centre and a professor of economics at the Crawford School of Public Policy, have defended the scheme, saying that it provides huge economic benefit to individuals and communities in the Pacific, and that there are safeguards in place to protect workers from abuse, and that research shows there is less exploitation for workers in the Seasonal Worker Programme than for backpackers working in agricultural jobs under another scheme. After the testimony to the Australian Senate, Vanuatu’s opposition leader, Ralph Regenvanu, tweeted he had “urged our government to seek to revise the agreements between the Vanuatu and Australian governments” concerning the schemes. “Vanuatu Government has its duty to safeguard its citizens.” “There have been issues regarding the safety of our workers, and this is one of the issues that will be addressed in the inquiry,” said Jason Daniels, the secretary to the Vanuatu parliament’s committee on economics and foreign policy. Daniels said that the inquiry was not set up because of the testimony in Australian parliament about the program, but would consider that testimony, along with other submissions made to the committee. “One of the challenges that the committee is looking into is the cost of applying for the programme... We also want to understand the benefits to Australia and New Zealand compared to benefits to Vanuatu and how we can address this.” In addition to the call for submissions, the parliamentary committee will also visit the outer islands of Vanuatu to speak to families and individuals impacted by the scheme. Sergio came to Australia to work on a seasonal worker program. But some weeks he'd walk away with only $70 in his paycheck.Farms across Australia are treating Pacific Island workers like slaves. And the Government hasn't just turned a blind eye - they've expanded the program. pic.twitter.com/KgcKoNqzto Regenvanu said that many of the issues arising from the scheme could have been addressed if the 2019 Labour Mobility Policy for Vanuatu was implemented by the government. “The policy addressed issues dealing with superannuation …, better worker preparedness, enhancing MOU to ensure more protection for workers in Australia and New Zealand, social cohesion, family life in Vanuatu, upskilling of workforce and also better integration back into Vanuatu,” said Regenvanu, who introduced the policy as foreign minister. Pacific labour mobility researcher Tupai Fotuosamoa Jackson said reviewing the programme and examining its impact on society was important, but that participants in the programmes could be afraid to participate honestly in the review, for fear of losing their job. “For the worker, there is an obligation to remain on the programme and there is a fear that your opportunity to continue will be impacted.” Jackson, who has published research into the impact of the seasonal scheme on family life in the Pacific, said that each government needs to consider what their threshold is. “How many people will they permit to be part of the programme and what is the impact of their absence to those left behind?”",News/World news,Vanuatu government launches inquiry into labour schemes after testimony from workers in Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/vanuatu-government-launches-inquiry-into-labour-schemes-after-testimony-from-workers-in-australia
2/23/2022,"A North Carolina motorcyclist is suing Amazon for $100m after his collision with a delivery driver resulted in the amputation of his left leg, claiming the company’s pressure on its employees rendered the driver distracted and caused the crash. The accident took place in October when motorcyclist Justin Hartley was hit by a Hertz truck with an Amazon logo in Virginia Beach, Virginia.  According to the lawsuit, the driver Christopher Gill admitted after the crash that he had his eyes on directions on his GPS, provided by Amazon, the Virginian-Pilot reported. The accident left Hartley gravely injured: it fractured his left wrist and he had to have his left knee amputated. “The unrealistic expectations that are put on the drivers are fueling these negligence cases,” said Kevin Biniazan, the attorney representing Hartley. “The driver was so entranced in making his delivery that he did not see our client,” he added. Biniazan has said this accident was “preventable”, and the lawsuit places the blame on the e-commerce giant itself, deepening allegations of harsh working conditions for Amazon workers that have dogged the company for years. Amazon delivery drivers have shared horror stories, including working 14-hour shifts and having to urinate in plastic bottles instead of going to the bathroom due to the intense demands of the job. Recently, Amazon workers at an Alabama warehouse won the chance to vote for a union a second time, after Amazon was found guilty of violating labor law during the first election. According to Hartley’s lawsuit, drivers are made to use a “Flex App” which dictates which directions the drivers should take and when to take bathroom or lunch breaks. If the driver is running behind, they are given reminders that they are “behind the rabbit” and have to be “rescued”. If a driver is “behind the rabbit” or requires “rescue” often enough, it can negatively affect their pay. The nature of this app can create “foreseeable risk that Amazon drivers will be distracted while operating their vehicles, resulting in a hazardous condition,” the lawsuit claimed, according to the Virginian-Pilot. Amazon has denied all allegations, saying in a statement to the Associated Press that the lawsuit failed to “implicate a legal or contractual responsibility owed on behalf of Amazon”. The company also denied Gill had committed “any act of negligence”. Gill responded to the lawsuit by denying that he initially admitted to authorities that he had been looking at the GPS, according to the Virginian Pilot. The paper also reported his lawyers plan to argue that the accident was the result of Hartley being “contributorily negligent” and “assum[ing] the risk of his actions and fail[ing] to mitigate his damages”. Amazon did not immediately respond to a Guardian request for further.

2/23/2022,"There are certain football phrases that instantly set off alarm bells. “As an industry” is one. “Get around him” is another. “AFL led delegation” is particularly problematic at this time of year. Whenever anyone vaguely connected with Australian Rules Football attends the Super Bowl, silly things are invariably said. Most of the time, they scam their way into the VIP area, photobomb some bewildered old line-backer, and get absolutely trolleyed.  But those a little bit higher on footy’s totem pole often come back brimming with ideas. Why, they ask on their panel shows and their radio slots, can’t our players and our ‘product’ be a bit more American? Why can’t we jazz up our match-day experience? Why can’t footballers wear $15,000 suits to games? Before long, they want a local version of US College drafting system. They want a translucent canopy draped across the MCG. Eddie McGuire was part of a delegation at last week’s Super Bowl. Like anyone who has been to SoFi Stadium, he was blown away. It is the most expensive stadium ever built. It has a glass roof. It has a floating, 80 million-pixelated, elliptical video screen beaming stats, replays and advertisements. Next year, it will host the 39th Wrestlemania. “It looks like an alien edifice dreamed up for a Star Trek movie,” Sports Illustrated wrote. For Eddie, the possibilities were dancing in his eyes. “A sensory overload,” he called it. When he gets on a roll – when he is bubbling ideas and unveiling five-year plans, he can be a strangely compelling and convincing figure. By the time he has drawn breath, you can find yourself pumping your first and screaming at your startled partner: “Oath we need a roof on the MCG. Damn straight we need underground pathways linking Bay 13, Richmond station, and our own version of Silicon Valley in the Jolimont railyards.” This is not an Eddie-bashing column. For all his trespasses, he has an excellent sense of sporting history, and of Melbourne. The city, and the sport it obsesses over, pulses through him. In this country right now, we are not very good at addressing the future. For the last two years, most of us barely cast our minds more than 24 hours ahead. Eddie himself did not have the best pandemic. But nothing is impossible for him. His mind and mouth drift 20 years back and rocket 50 years forward, sometimes within the space of a single sentence. A lot of his frustration seems to stem from the fact that most people do not look at the world the same way. Red tape, budgets, prevailing public opinion – they are for clerks. We need people like him – thinking big, throwing flames, crashing through – but they need reining in. It is obvious that the MCG’s Great Southern Stand is due for an upgrade. When it was constructed in the early 1990s, Victoria was just emerging from a crippling recession. Jeff Kennett was about to blaze in and change everything. Eddie was breaking every story and propping up every bar in Melbourne. At the stand’s unveiling, Wasim Akram tore through the Englishmen in the World Cup Final. Ian Botham copped a howler of a decision, and embarked on one of the all-time great benders. We were genuinely proud of it. And we still are. “The MCG is a shrine, a citadel, a landmark, a totem,” the Age’s Greg Baum once wrote. “It is to this city what the Opera House is to Sydney, the Eiffel Tower to Paris and the Statue of Liberty to New York.” The world, this city, and the way we watch sport has completely changed since Baum wrote that. Forty years on, the MCG is in danger of being shown up by Perth’s Optus Stadium, and the Adelaide Oval. Eddie wants to tear down the Great Southern Stand and start again. Others are urging restraint. For many, it is an opportune time to reflect on what we actually want as spectators. Are we fans, or are we consumers? Do we simply want to watch sport, or are seeking an experience? And do we want a fading citadel, or a shiny sports and entertainment precinct? “Why would you willingly sit in the rain in 2022?” SEN owner Craig Hutchison asked on his podcast this week? Hutchy knows his American Football. Like Eddie, he is a big picture man. Unlike Eddie, he is no footy romantic. He thinks Australian sports fans worry too much about want they don’t want and are blind to what is possible. Perhaps he is right. What I don’t want at the MCG could fill a column. I don’t want a sensory overload. I don’t want Guy Grossi dishing up Duck Surprise at quarter time. I don’t want fun facilitators perforating my eardrums. I don’t want T-shirts being fired into the crowd like mortar cannons. I don’t want the MCG, a ground I love, to be visible from outer space. Nick Hornby once wrote that English football was “prey go all sorts of people who weren’t, as it were, the people.” This is a good opportunity to actually listen to ordinary fans, not those with the loudest voices and the deepest pockets. If they stuffed it up, and if it ended up resembling a gargantuan version of – oh I don’t know – Docklands Stadium, it would be an act of vandalism. Baum himself recalls a conversation at the MCG on grand final day with former Brownlow Medallist, Neil Roberts. “Lucky bastards,” Roberts said, gazing at the vast, sunbathed crowd. “They could screw up everything and they would still have this.” We still have it. After two years, we are about to get it back at full capacity. And it should never be at the mercy of February thought bubbles and arms races.",Sport/Sport,MCG revamp requires closer study than a feverish Eddie McGuire thought bubble | Jonathan Horn,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/23/mcg-revamp-requires-closer-study-than-a-feverish-eddie-mcguire-thought-bubble
2/23/2022,"Australia’s membership of a global, US-based anti-corruption alliance is under threat after years of inaction and missed deadlines prompted a formal warning that the Morrison government was acting “contrary” to the body’s requirements. The Australian government signed up to the Open Government Partnership in 2015, a 78-country multilateral initiative designed to promote open government, fight corruption and empower citizen participation in policymaking.  But Australia’s efforts since have frustrated the group. It has failed to act on prior promises – including to improve donations transparency and strengthen the nation’s anti-corruption framework – and has missed the deadline to file its latest two-year action plan for 2021-23, which was due in December. That prompted the OGP chief executive, Sanjay Pradhan, to write to the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet last week, warning that if it failed to meet the next deadline, its membership status would be reviewed. “This letter is to inform you that as of the deadline of 31 December 2021, the Support Unit has not received Australia’s 2021-23 Action Plan, and therefore has acted contrary to the OGP process,” Pradhan said. “Governments that act contrary to process for two consecutive cycles are placed under review by the OGP Steering Committee, which involves enhanced support to resolve the issues that led to being placed in that status. Guidance materials for the new standards will be available soon.” Freedom of information expert Peter Timmins, who led efforts for Australia to join the OGP in 2015, said the latest failure showed Australia was now under serious scrutiny from the OGP. “Regrettably it comes as no surprise to anyone familiar with the government’s record,” he told the Guardian. “Those not suffering fatigue from trying to get government to take meaningful steps to improve how our democracy can work better are ready, willing and able to put scepticism to one side. “And we await with interest to see what those running for office have to put on the table.” Prior commitments made through the OGP process have never come to fruition, including a 2016 pledge to ensure “Australia’s information access laws policies and practices are fit for the 21st century”. The Morrison government’s official website on the OGP lists several of Australia’s prior commitments as “delayed”, including commitments to “enhance the transparency of political donations and funding” and “strengthen the national anti-corruption framework”. Australia has submitted two separate action plans to the OGP, the first from 2016-18, and the second spanning 2018-20. The second plan largely repeated commitments made in the first plan. In September, the OGP published an independent assessment of Australia’s efforts in 2018-20. The report found progress had been slow on donations and corruption issues and that progress on the second action plan was now treated as “old news”. “Commitments on strengthening the national anticorruption framework and enhancing transparency of political donations made little or slow progress over this period,” the assessment said. The assessment suggested Australia has been working on a third action plan. But the OGP has received no such document from the responsible minister, Ben Morton. The report also noted that Covid had disrupted some of the government’s OGP work. A spokesperson for the department of prime minister and cabinet said Australia remained committed to the OGP and delivering on its national action plans. “Significant accomplishments have been made since Australia joined in 2015,” the spokesperson said. “However, the response to the Covid-19 pandemic has been the government’s priority over the last two years.”",News/Australia news,Australia formally warned it is acting ‘contrary’ to global anti-corruption alliance,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/23/australia-formally-warned-it-is-acting-contrary-to-global-anti-corruption-alliance
2/23/2022,"Australia’s market concentration made the Covid-related shortages worse and will hamper the economy’s recovery and future growth unless addressed, Rod Sims, outgoing chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, said. In a wide-ranging National Press Club speech on Wednesday, Sims described the market-based economy as “fragile”, blasted governments for focussing on how much infrastructure can be sold for, and described electricity and gas markets as a “mess”, in part because carbon emissions do not carry a price.“In my view, and the view of many others, the Australian economy suffers from high levels of market concentration to the detriment of consumers and productivity,” Sims said, according to a copy of his speech. “The most important tool to prevent this is our merger laws and they are not up to the task.”  Australia was currently facing supply and logistic challenges because of Covid, he said: “I think these are made worse by our market concentration in so many areas and infrastructure bottlenecks. We need to address this through competition law, to tackle anti-competitive abuses of market power, and through general infrastructure reform.” Sims has run the ACCC for 11 years and will step down this week. He made it clear, though, that he was not retiring, and would continue to push for competition reform. “We must recognise that a market-based economy is fragile as its organising principle relies on companies and businesspeople pursuing their own self-interest,” he said. “For this to work to the benefit of all Australians requires at a minimum strong competition between firms and strong enforcement of the [Competition and Consumer Act].” The ACCC now has 11 competition cases currently in court, and “some important competition cases which will unfold very soon,” he said. Among law changes needed, he said, many people would be surprised to know that many activities such as selling unsafe goods, not honouring consumer guarantees, and large companies abusing their position of strength by treating customers unfairly, were not generally unlawful. “There is a school of thought that commerce in a market economy is a no-holds-barred robust business, and that competition law should only rarely interfere in this,” Sims said, adding that anti-competitive activity was “by far” a larger problem than taking up enforcement cases that failed to find wrongdoing by businesses. In addition, Australia was “almost unique in not having a formal merger approval system”, with the ACCC having to prove in court that future negative consequences would occur from a corporate combination. Similarly, the country “almost uniquely” seemed to focus “on how much we can sell infrastructure assets for, rather than having our infrastructure benefit our wider economy,” Sims said. “Such behaviour can dramatically affect existing users and could be considered a continuing tax on the community.” Sims also indicated the Abbott government’s scrapping of a price on greenhouse gas emissions had contributed to poor market outcomes in energy. “Our electricity and gas markets are in a mess for a wide range of reasons,” Sims said. “Most of the world has accepted that there is a negative externality associated with carbon,” he said. “With Australia having decided not to deal with this issue via a market-based mechanism, we are left with a challenge of how we achieve affordability, sustainability and reliability, without seriously trading off one of these objectives to achieve another.” Among the ACCC’s achievements during his decade-plus chairmanship, Sims highlighted successes in extracting $200m annually from technology giants for their use of Australian content, and court wins against companies such as Trivago and Google. The commission also secured recent penalties of $50m against Telstra, $125m against Volkswagen and $153m against education provider AIPE. “I assure you all I am not retiring,” Sims said in concluding his speech. “I will have positions that will see me continue to advocate on many issues, both in Australia and internationally.”",News/Australia news,"Australia’s post-Covid recovery will be hurt by high levels of market concentration, ACCC’s Rod Sims says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/23/australias-post-covid-recovery-will-be-hurt-by-high-levels-of-market-concentration-acccs-rod-sims-says
