5/10/2022,"An apt indication of just how much discussion the rise of Carlos Alcaraz has generated came on Monday in Rafael Nadal’s pre-tournament press conference at the Italian Open. Wary of how often Nadal has already had to discuss his young compatriot in recent months, a journalist introduced their question by expressing their hope that Nadal would not be annoyed by yet more Alcaraz talk to come. “I will never be annoyed about answering questions about colleague of mine,” Nadal responded. Alcaraz will not be seen in Rome this year. Shortly after his breathless triumph against Alexander Zverev in the final of the Madrid Open on Sunday, he announced he would be withdrawing from the tournament in order to recuperate before the French Open begins. Still, his rise has been the defining story of the past two months and his success will continue to loom over the tour until the French Open begins. “He definitely is special,” said Novak Djokovic, who lost against Alcaraz in the semi-final in Madrid. “I mean, already he’s breaking a lot of records as a teenager, winning two Masters events this year, a couple of 500s. So far he’s the best player in the world, no question, this year with the results that he’s been doing.” So far this year, Alcaraz has compiled an absurd 28-3 (90%) record, he has won four titles in as many months including two Masters 1000 victories in Miami and Madrid and two ATP 500 events. He has been clinical against the very best, winning eight of his past nine matches against top-10 players. While he was already far above the curve when he was ranked 120th in May 2021, now he is sixth in the ATP rankings and second in the ATP race. The respect he has already garnered was further shown by Nadal ‘s lack of surprise at Alcaraz’s success. “No reaction,” said Nadal, vanquished by Alcaraz in the round before Djokovic last week. “Nothing new in my opinion, no? He already won in Miami, won in Barcelona. Honestly is not a big surprise. Happy for him. Everybody knows the amount of confidence he has right now, the level that he can reach.” The statistics, as spectacular as they are, only tell some of Alcaraz’s story this year. He has arrived on the tour with a game that is already almost complete and a comprehensive toolbox of shots, with each new tournament seemingly bringing out a little more of his skill and dynamism. In his first full season as a top-100 player, Alcaraz is already, surely, the fastest player on the tour and his athleticism has allowed him to win so many points from audacious defensive positions. He pairs his defence with brutal, heavy shotmaking off both wings. He is already one of the best returners in the world and his confidence at the net is striking. Despite all of that, his defining shot has been that delicate forehand drop shot, which he has audaciously pulled out on big points throughout this year, and which contrasts so effectively with his nuclear driven forehand. “I think it’s incredible what he’s doing right now,” said Emma Raducanu. “Being so young and being so consistent is really impressive. I think the way that he moves is really gracious and elegant. If you watch him, it just looks like he’s flying through the air. He’s super aggressive, can just take the racquet out of someone’s hands.” The Madrid Open final itself showed just how things have shifted since the first major title of the year. Standing before Alcaraz was Zverev, the player who for so long was hyped as the leading talent of the younger generation from as young as 16 years old. Zverev has certainly enjoyed a good career, but on Sunday as he was dismantled and the gulf between their levels was stark. While Zverev had reason to be frustrated by Madrid’s poor scheduling, his second serve and forehand crumbling in important moments has been a continuous theme in his career. Other well-hyped players of his generation have been limited by poor returning, insufficient variety or a glaring, weaker groundstroke. By comparison, Alcaraz’s game is so well fortified, with his service precision his only real technical weak point. With such a strong foundation, he has effortlessly marked himself as a grand slam threat at just 19. Now, as he schedules like a top player already, he will try to play like one when it matters most across best of five set matches in the coming French Open. However, as he rests, Nadal and Djokovic will be working in Rome to gain sufficient matchplay and progress enough to meet him at the top of his level in Paris. On Monday in Rome, Stan Wawrinka won his first match in more than a year after returning from two foot surgeries earlier in the clay season. The 37-year-old, the only player other than Nadal or Djokovic to win the title at Roland Garros in the past 12 years, pulled off an excellent 3-6, 7-5, 6-2 victory against the No 17 Reilly Opelka. Dan Evans was defeated 7-6(2), 6-2 in the first round by Nikoloz Basilashvili.",Sport/Sport,Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz is talk of the tour – even in his absence,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/09/spains-carlos-alcaraz-is-talk-of-the-tour-even-in-his-absence

5/10/2022,"Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the Democratic Unionist party leader, has rebuffed appeals by the British and Irish governments and said he will block the formation of a new power-sharing administration in Northern Ireland. Donaldson told the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, on Monday that the DUP will not nominate ministers to the Stormont executive later this week unless Downing Street takes “decisive action” on the Brexit protocol. Such a boycott would trigger a political crisis and paralyse devolved government in the region just a week after Sinn Féin triumphed in an assembly election, making its deputy leader, Michelle O’Neill, the putative first minister. The DUP came second, winning 25 seats to Sinn Féin’s 27 in the 90-seat assembly. Under power-sharing rules, the executive cannot form unless the DUP nominates a deputy first minister and other ministers. After meeting Lewis, Donaldson repeated an election campaign promise to disrupt Stormont unless there were changes to the protocol. “Until we get decisive action taken by the UK government on the protocol, we will not be nominating ministers to the executive,” he said. The DUP says the protocol, which puts trade checks on some goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain, harms the economy and undermines the region’s position within the UK. Only if those problems were resolved could it join an executive, said Donaldson. “We want to see stable political institutions, we want to be part of the executive, we want to play our part.” Most unionists oppose the protocol but are divided on how to respond. Some favour working with London and Brussels to tweak the agreement. Others advocate obstruction and resistance, a radical strain that has pulled the DUP to a hardline position, leaving it isolated. Lewis, who flew into Belfast from London, delivered a coded rebuke when he urged all the main parties at Stormont to deliver a “stable and accountable” devolved government. Ireland’s taoiseach, Micheál Martin, said Northern Ireland’s party leaders had a duty to heed voters who wanted a functional government to tackle crises in the cost of living and health services: “All of us now have to have due regard to stability within the north, to the full workings of the institutions of the Good Friday agreement.” He told RTÉ there was a “landing zone” for compromise on the protocol between London and Brussels. Downing Street has given mixed signals about possible unilateral action. All sides will monitor the Queen’s speech at the state opening of parliament on Tuesday for further signals. The EU vice-president, Maroš Šefčovič, urged pragmatism. “We need the UK government to dial down the rhetoric, be honest about the deal they signed and agree to find solutions within its framework,” he said in a statement. O’Neill said the DUP should not try to “punish the public” for its mistakes on Brexit. “Brinkmanship will not be tolerated where the north of Ireland becomes collateral damage in a game of chicken with the European Commission. Make no mistake, we and our business community here will not be held to ransom.” Other party leaders echoed the calls for the swift formation of an executive. “I want us to sit down, get the negotiations under way on the programme for government and the budget,” said Naomi Long, leader of Alliance, which won 17 seats, making it the third biggest party. “We need the DUP to step up to the plate. You know, with power comes responsibility, and people now need to take the responsibility seriously.” Doug Beattie, leader of the Ulster Unionist’s nine assembly members, said problems with the protocol would be resolved only through talks between London and Brussels. “Northern Ireland has to have a say in that. We’ll only have a say if we have a government.”",News/Politics,DUP to block formation of Northern Ireland power-sharing executive,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/09/dup-to-block-formation-of-northern-ireland-power-sharing-executive
5/10/2022,"“This was life or death,” Jorge Molina said and he had chosen life again, clinging on to primera, his place. It had taken him until he was 29 to reach the first division, finally making it around about the time a career in the lower leagues should have started winding down, eight seasons, five teams, three tiers, more than 250 games and a hundred goals after he had begun in Benidorm. Twice it had been taken away from him, twice he returned, fighting back when he was supposed to be finished, and there was no way he was going to let it be three. Which is why come Saturday afternoon he was standing there in the sunshine smiling a little shyly and up in one corner of the stands they were celebrating. Granada are not safe yet, but the tension was released for a few hours at least, something very significant secured beyond the three points they had so badly needed after five months in which they won only once in the league. “We like seeing them happy,” the coach Aitor Karanka said at the end of Saturday’s vital victory over Real Mallorca lifted his team out of the relegation zone for the first time since he took over three unbeaten weeks ago. “When I came in, all I saw were anxious, nervous faces,” he said. “The weight taken from our shoulders is brutal. If today was a final, we would be champions.” They felt like it, joy let in at last. Mallorca and Granada were on edge, two of the five teams for whom the threat of relegation was a reality. Outside Granada’s training ground, fans had waited with fireworks as they set off to the airport on Friday; outside Son Moix the following afternoon, Mallorca’s fans did the same. The day had started with Alavés on 28 points, Levante on 29, Granada 31, Cadiz 32 and Mallorca 32. Cadiz were playing Elche and Alaves were going to Celta, two teams with nothing to play for. First, though, Mallorca and Granada met. Lose and Granada could be four points adrift plus head-to-head goal difference with three games left against Athletic, Betis and Espanyol, as good as gone. Instead, they won 6-2, their biggest away win ever. Granada had scored early but that brought a false sense of security that was soon shattered when Salva Sevilla smashed in a superb equaliser. Afterwards Karanka refused to reveal what he had said at half-time but might as well have done so when he said: “I used words I can’t say here: it wasn’t so much a case of motivating them as making demands of them.” Whatever it was, it worked: 40 seconds after the restart, a gorgeous move finished off by Sergio Escudero put them in the lead again. But this still wasn’t done against a Mallorca side showing signs of reaction under Javier Aguirre and when Luis Suárez, their Colombian forward, limped off, it didn’t look good. As it turned out, it was better. Molina had been on the pitch exactly two minutes when he got his first touch, a mountain of man gently rolling an opponent and starting the move that almost lead to a goal. He had been there three minutes three seconds when he got his second, or he would have done had he actually touched it. Instead he cleverly let the ball go, turned and moved into the space, pointing to precisely where he wanted it. From there, he played it into the path of Antonio Puertas to score the third. Next he smashed in the forth from twenty-five yards. And still he wasn’t finished. The clock had shown 50.59 when he stepped into the sunshine; by the time he had walked off again three quarters of an hour later, Granada had scored six. As for Molina, here’s his game by numbers: Minutes: 44Touches: 16Passes: 12Shots: 2Goals: 2Assists: 2Age: 40 years, 15 days. No one older had ever ever scored twice in La Liga. Only Donato had ever scored a goal later. Only three players had ever played older, and one of them sort of doesn’t count: the magnificently named Horace “Harry” Lowe was really a manager whose 11th man got ill before a trip to Valencia in 1935 so he put himself into the team instead. Nor was this a one-off, especially not for poor Mallorca. The last time they had faced each other, Molina scored a hat-trick – 39 at the time and the oldest footballer ever to do so in La Liga – and he looked a little embarrassed as he quietly insisted: “No, it’s nothing personal.”n Instead, these two goals made him Granada’s top scorer, on 10 league goals, 12 in all competitions. He also has six assists. From 16 starts and 19 shots. On Saturday Granada responded to his exhibition by sending a tweet to Spain coach Luis Enrique. Yoo-hoo! “It’s wonderful to have him in the team. Every time he plays he makes things happen: a goal, an assist, a free-kick. Today it’s two goals, two assists and hopefully he can play for many years,” Puertas said, which might be pushing it but he has renewed so there will be one more. That extension is is no act of charity. Molina has two degrees, in sports sciences and teaching, his coaching badge and a qualification as a sporting director, but his former manager Diego Martínez encouraged him to keep playing as long as he can because that’s still better than anything else. Besides, Molina admits that the idea of retiring scares him, the change drastic, the void it will leave vast. He fasts for 16 hours a day and for 24 hours at least once a week, looks after himself better than anyone else. Quiet, softly spoken, a hint of timidity, no attempt to stand out, still less speak out, there is though a presence about him, a seriousness too, also a solidarity. And then there’s the talent. Watch him and he’s still better than others, an intelligence, a smooth efficiency, about everything he does, the use of his body unmatched, the decision making flawless, without the slightest fuss. “Until you work with him you don’t realise just how good he is at everything,” Karanka said on Saturday. “What he generates, how he finishes. When you coach him you realise what a spectacular lad he is: he is great in the dressing room and on the pitch. When you actual know him, you start to understand.” “The only pity is I didn’t know him 20 years ago,” Karanka added, but then no one really knew him 20 years ago. In May 2002, while Karanka was preparing for Real Madrid’s third Champions League final in five years, Molina was 382km and a million miles away, a student hoping to make the first team at Benidorm in Spain’s amateur, regionalised tercera with its 17 groups and 350 teams. Back then, driving back and forwards from Valencia in his little Seat every day, reaching the elite rarely crossed his mind. Which may be why departing again doesn’t bear thinking about now: he better than anyone knows how hard it has been to get this far, appreciates it for the monumental achievement it is. Never in the youth system at a big club, Molina went to Gandia and back, immediately suffering relegation back to Segunda B when he reached the second division with Poli Ejido aged 25. He joined Betis in the second division in 2010, top scorer as they went up, finally taking him to the first division in 2011 but got relegated in 2014. Top scorer again when they went back up in 2015, he departed in 2016. Dropping down a division, aged 34, Betis were not alone in assuming that was it but he was top scorer for Getafe as they, and he, returned to primera. He has played at least 33 games a season ever since. That was six seasons ago and he’s still here. It’s not just that he carries on; it’s that he carries on getting better. Scorer of five league goals in primera before the age of 30, he has 67 since. Getafe 0-0 Rayo Vallecano, Villarreal 1-1 Sevilla, Espanyol 1-1 Osasuna, Atlético Madrid 1-0 Real Madrid, Real Mallorca 2-6 Granada, Athletic Bilbao 0-0 Valencia, Cádiz 3-0 Elche, Celta Vigo 4-0 Alavés, Real Betis 1-2 Barcelona, Levante 2-1 Real Sociedad And he’s not planning on going anywhere else any time soon. Cadiz beating Elche means that they are only one place and two points from the relegation zone with three games left, more points needed, but there is hope now, something to hold on to, another season in the sun. “This means we’re still alive,” Molina said. “This was vital, a game we had to win come what may. We had improved but hadn’t been able to pick up three points and if we had lost it would have been, very, very complicated. The response from the team was wonderful. This was what we wanted: a team that battles, that fights, that leaves everything on the pitch. No one expected to win like this.” And what about you, he was asked, where’s your ceiling, what can you do now? Jorge Molina smiled. “Keep enjoying playing football, which is what I like most,” he said.",Sport/Football,Jorge Molina lets the joy in at last for Granada's La Liga survival fight | Sid Lowe,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/09/jorge-molina-lets-joy-in-at-last-granada-la-liga-survival-fight
5/10/2022,"It was written by two university students, had its first run in a converted hotel conference centre at the Edinburgh fringe and then took the West End by storm. Now, the hit musical Six – in which Henry VIII’s wives give a “histo-remix” pop concert with songs such as Don’t Lose Ur Head – has become the talk of Broadway. On Monday, the show created by Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss during their final term at Cambridge University received eight nominations for this year’s Tony awards, including best original score, best direction of a musical and best musical. Moss, who is about to direct a new version of Legally Blonde at Regent’s Park Open Air theatre in London, said that she was in the middle of the first day of technical rehearsals for that show when her phone began to ping as the nominations were announced. “My head’s very much somewhere else right now,” she laughed. “There’s a lot going on.” Moss, who at 26 became the youngest female director of a Broadway musical for Six, had originally wondered if it might open in a smaller off-Broadway venue instead. But the response to the musical when it was staged as a tryout in Chicago encouraged producers to decide that they could take it straight to a major New York theatre. “Only a few little things” were altered in the script and lyrics for the US production, such as changing “mate” to “friend”, and swapping words that might sound odd in an American accent. (The Broadway cast sing in their own accents.) “We were originally worried about whether [US audiences] would get it – do they know enough about British history, how much do they care about Henry VIII? But although it’s not American history, the pop concert is an American form. American audiences know what to do in a pop concert situation.” The show had been due to officially open on Broadway on 12 March 2020 but the city’s theatres were closed because of the Covid crisis at 5pm, just hours before curtain up. The feeling that day, said Moss, had been one of relief as she was so worried about whether it was right that venues should still be open and whether her family should even be visiting a theatre amid the rising infection rates. Moss co-directs the Broadway production of Six with Jamie Armitage. “Jamie and I did the show together as students in 2017 – I was the choreographer and he was the director.” The pair share the nomination for best director, while Six’s costume designer Gabriella Slade, lighting designer Tim Deiling, sound designer Paul Gatehouse, choreographer Carrie-Anne Ingrouille and orchestrator Tom Curran are also nominated. Moss and Marlow have almost finished writing a new stage musical, Why Am I So Single?, which is about friendship and dating for people in their 20s. They are also working on an animated family feature. Six has won the pair a legion of fans, known as the queendom, some of whom create tribute art which has decorated the foyer of Six’s venues. Their fans also take part in cosplay and create Six costumes. “Our materials had been sourced from Shepherd’s Bush Market,” Moss told the Guardian earlier this year. “Once fans found out where to get the Anne Boleyn material we had to go and buy all of it in order to make more costumes ourselves!” The Tony awards will be held at Radio City Music Hall in New York on 12 June.

5/10/2022,"Sixty-two years after the end of British rule, Cyprus has taken another step out of the shadow of its colonial past with a deal that ushers in the biggest change in land use on the island since independence. Describing the accord as groundbreaking, the president of the Republic of Cyprus, Nicos Anastasiades, said it would enable thousands of Cypriots to develop properties in the “sovereign base areas” that Britain has long held on to in the Mediterranean country. That, he said, would not only yield “multiple benefits”, but correct “distortions and imbalances” in the lives of residents living in villages incorporated in the facilities. “This is a truly historic agreement,” the leader told officials gathered in Nicosia’s presidential palace on Monday. “[It] is expected to not only have important development prospects for those who reside, or who have properties, on the bases, but for the economy and society more generally at an especially difficult time following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.” The sovereign base areas – which include military bases, but also farms and residential land – account for 3% of the island’s total landmass, or 98 sq miles. Although the accord was reached in 2014 under Britain’s then prime minister, David Cameron, it required years of complex negotiations underscored by the peculiar nature of territory that, while home to about 12,000 Cypriots, remained in the possession of the country’s former colonial power. On 16 May, when the deal comes into effect, owners will be able to submit planning applications to develop properties much as they can elsewhere on the island. Until now, non-military development of base areas, with the exception of agricultural land, has been tightly controlled, eliciting disquiet among local people, who have complained of being penalised in a country already divided since the 1974 Turkish invasion. Calling the accord “a memorable moment” in ties between the two nations, Britain’s high commissioner to Cyprus, Stephen Lillie, predicted that it would contribute greatly to the quality of life for those living on the military bases. “Our agreement means that, as far as possible, residents in the bases will now enjoy the same rights as Cypriots living in the republic to sell and develop their land and property and all the benefits that brings,” Lillie said. “I take pride in the fact that we have worked together to deliver a change that will have a real and positive impact on people’s lives.” Restrictions have meant that much of the territory has remained unspoiled in contrast to otherwise heavily developed coastline in the rest of the island’s south. As of next week, planning zones and policies in force elsewhere will come into effect, but the commander of British Forces Cyprus, Maj Gen Rob Thomson, insisted that development would also be subject to environmental and security controls. The installations are viewed as huge strategic assets by the UK, with RAF Akrotiri used as a forward mounting base for multiple operations across the region. Post-Brexit and in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the facilities’ strategic advantage has intensified. In a first visit to the island by a chief of general staff in almost a decade, Gen Sir Mark Carleton-Smith highlighted Cyprus’ significance to the British military. “The UK is fortunate to enjoy a close bilateral partnership with the Republic of Cyprus and we retain sovereign bases here and have for many decades,” he said. “They offer a military platform for us to base troops in the eastern Mediterranean but also to use it as a springboard to shorten our response times across the region. It’s a region with a degree of strategic volatility and it’s to our military advantage to acclimatise, train and prepare troops here in Cyprus.”",News/World news,Deal allows Cyprus to develop land in British sovereign base areas,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/deal-allows-cyprus-to-develop-land-in-british-sovereign-base-areas
5/10/2022,"For much of his career, the artist Donald Baechler, who has died of a heart attack aged 65, was the victim of mistaken identity. Having come of age in Manhattan, New York, in the 1980s at the same time as the painters Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring, and represented by the same dealer, Tony Shafrazi, and because his work, like theirs, looked streetwise, Baechler was widely categorised as a graffiti artist. He was not. The mistake had come about when he asked a friend for an introduction to Shafrazi, ex-gallerist to his old art school hero, the conceptualist Joseph Kosuth. To his surprise, the dealer – who had by then moved on from conceptualism to graffiti art – offered him a show. The fame Shafrazi brought him was to prove something of a poisoned chalice. He was, he said, always to “feel like a fish out of water” at the gallery. Baechler’s work would never fit into any obvious category. In truth, his art was an intentionally eclectic mix of many movements and schools, united by his cerebral interest in them. Being promoted by Shafrazi in the mid-80s meant that institutional recognition quickly followed. Baechler’s work was included in the São Paulo Biennial in 1987 and the Whitney Biennial in 1989, and was soon being shown in such blue-chip venues as Thaddaeus Ropac in Paris and the Museum der Moderne in Salzburg. In 1998, he had his first solo foreign exhibition, at the Kunsthalle in Basel, Switzerland. The six monumental paintings in this were the first of his canvases to sell for more than $100,000 apiece. Baechler’s work has been collected by the Museum of Modern Art in New York; the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles; the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam; and the Pompidou Centre in Paris. His style consisted of breezy-looking, childlike paintings, often of flowers or faces, made in gesso or a peach-skinned vinyl gouache called flashe laid over a collaged background. A canvas such as Memory & Illusion (Globe) (1998) seemed to call out to be read. Baechler, though, insisted that his paintings were entirely abstract, their forms appearing by chance as he worked on them. “For me, it’s always been more about line, form, balance,” he said. “All these silly formalist concerns.” So, too, with his titles. Donald Donald (Study for Victims of Emigrants) (1984) took its name from a piece of random graffiti Baechler had happened to see on a wall in the Bowery: he was annoyed to be told, later, that the wall had been that of the Emigrant Savings Bank, at which the graffiti had been aimed. “The work is not about banks,” a vexed Baechler said, adding, helpfully, “There are some ducks in it, too.” Titles were only one of the things that he picked up as he went along. Baechler’s vast studio in Crosby Street, Lower Manhattan, contained a huge archive of scraps – bits of paper, discarded toys, pieces of cloth – set aside to be collaged, Schwitters-like, on to his canvases. This habit had been formed when he spent a teenage summer working as a janitor at the Wadsworth Atheneum art museum in his home town of Hartford, Connecticut. He had learned to love paintings there, and to love archives at the same time. The two would remain linked in his practice. His work looked simple; it was anything but. Baechler had a profound knowledge of art history that, like his scraps, might find its way into his work. Asked to name his two favourite painters, he chose Cy Twombly and Giotto. Nor was painting by chance the easy process it sounded. “Is the edge of this line painted correctly?”, he wondered aloud. “Should these drips be here or not? I change these things a hundred times before I get them right.” This playing-off of simplicity and complexity in his art may have come from his Quaker childhood. The second of four children of Henry, a state accountant, and Marjorie (nee Dolliver), a reporter on the Glastonbury Citizen, Baechler would spend family Sundays divided between the Wadsworth Atheneum and the local Friends’ Meeting House. It was in the former that he recalled, at 13, seeing his first Andy Warhol, a painting of soup tins. Later, in the 80s, Warhol would make a series of Polaroid portraits of the rising young artist, one of which, of Baechler absent-mindedly picking his nose, he later silkscreened in silver. Baechler attended the Maryland Institute College of Art from 1974 to 1977, and then went to Cooper Union in New York, he met a pair of German exchange students. “I found the whole scene at the school to be white and boring,” Baechler recalled. What the Germans told him of art back home piqued his interest. By 1979, he was at the Staatliche Hochschule für Bildende Künste in Frankfurt, where he spent a year. It was a revelation. “Most of us knew about Joseph Beuys,” Baechler said, “but hardly any Americans had heard of Polke, Richter, or Baselitz.” Despite its apparently homegrown appearance, it was to these Germans rather than to Basquiat that his work owed its style. Not everyone saw the depth beneath the surface shallowness of Baechler’s art. One critic of the New York Times found his paintings “banal in their associations, bullying the viewer by their size”. The citizens of Westhampton, Long Island, were vociferous in their dislike of Baechler’s 30ft-tall sculpture, Walking Figure (2008), installed outside their local airport. Reactions on the town’s Facebook page ranged from “NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!” to “I thought a scrap dealer’s truck threw up!” To these brickbats, Baechler responded with customary mildness: “I think it will be liked when people get used to it,” he said. Uncannily youthful in his 60s, he had the abstracted air of a young philosophy don. For every doubter of his art there was a devotee, the latter often more sophisticated than the former. His collectors included the designer Kate Spade and the Interview magazine publisher, Peter Brant. Among his fans was the revered critic Robert Pincus-Witten, who compared Baechler to Buster Keaton. His work, Pincus-Witten said, often looked as though it was about to slip on a banana peel, and yet “alighted without fail on the side of refinement and tact”.

5/10/2022,"Emmanuel Macron has called for a new political organisation to unite democracies on the European continent, as he warned that Ukraine would probably not join the EU for several decades. Speaking two days after being sworn in for a second term as French president, Macron called for big thinking on the future of Europe, saying the war in Ukraine showed the need for a “historic process of reflection”. He proposed “a European political community … a new European organisation [that] would enable democratic European nations who adhere to our values to find a new space for political cooperation”, listing security, energy, transport, infrastructure investment and movement across borders, especially for young people, as issues that body would tackle. Being part of this organisation would not exclude a country from joining the EU, and the organisation could include “those who have left” the bloc, he said. Macron’s intervention comes as EU states clash on how quickly to move forward with Kyiv’s membership application. The question is likely to reach a crunch point in June, when EU leaders decide whether to grant Ukraine candidate status, a procedural step that normally takes years to attain. Macron suggested he favoured a quick decision on candidate status, while dampening Kyiv’s hopes of a speedy entry into the EU. The awarding of candidate status is followed by talks on accession and a process of reform so that a country meets the EU’s political, economic and legal criteria. “Even if we were to give it the status of candidate country tomorrow – I hope we move forward towards accession rapidly – even if we were to do that, we all know only too well the process for accession would take several years; in truth, it would probably take several decades. And that is the truth unless we decide to lower the standards for accession and rethink the unity of our Europe, and also partially the principles that we hold,” he said. “The European Union, given its level of integration and ambition, cannot be the only way to structure the European continent in the short term.” Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, is championing a speedy processing of Ukraine’s membership application, backed by central and eastern European states. Western European members, however, are wary about allowing Ukraine to proceed quickly, fearing Kyiv would not have time to complete vital political reforms, while the process would stoke tensions with six western Balkan countries that have been stuck in the EU membership queue for years. Von der Leyen said Ukraine had submitted a 5,000-page document to Brussels answering questions on its suitability to join the bloc, and in remarks aimed at Ukrainians at an event in the European parliament to celebrate Europe Day, she said: “The future of Europe is also your future.” Macron also set out goals for the war, saying Europe had “to do everything to ensure that Ukraine will survive, Russia will never win, preserve peace on the rest of the continent of Europe and avoid any escalation”. Only Ukraine could decide on negotiating conditions with Russia, he said. And he warned against a punitive settlement on Russia when the war is over. “When peace returns to European soil, we will have to build new security balances and together we must never give into the temptation … or the desire for revenge, because we know how much that has ravished the road to peace in the past.” The two leaders were speaking at a special session of the European parliament in Strasbourg, where they marked the end of an 11-month citizens’ juries project, the Conference on the Future of Europe. At the closing ceremony, EU leaders, citizens and MEPs listened to the EU anthem and watched an interpretative dance routine performed in the aisles of the parliament’s debating chamber. Both leaders contrasted the event with the Victory Day commemorations in Moscow. Referring to a woman who appeared with her baby at the Strasbourg ceremony, Von der Leyen said she wanted to celebrate this image on 9 May, “an image far more powerful than any military parade going up and down the streets of Moscow”. Away from the soaring rhetoric, the citizens project has triggered a row about whether the EU should change its treaties in response to its conclusions – 49 proposals covering the climate emergency, health and young people, among other themes. Von der Leyen said treaty change could not be excluded, while Macron said he supported proposals to convene a convention to revise the treaties. But a group of 13 Nordic, central and eastern European countries hit back at people seeking to “instrumentalise” the Conference on the Future of Europe, probably a reference to federalists in the European parliament.",News/World news,Macron calls for new European body and warns Ukraine of EU wait,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/macron-calls-for-new-european-body-and-warns-ukraine-of-eu-wait
5/10/2022,"Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the son and namesake of the late dictator, is set to become the Philippines’ next president after taking an unassailable lead in the election, signalling an extraordinary rehabilitation of one of the country’s most notorious political families. With more than 70% of the votes tabulated, Marcos Jr had more than 23.5m, far ahead of his closest rival, the current vice-president, Leni Robredo, a former human rights lawyer, who had 11.1m. The size of his lead means a comeback by his opponents is not possible. In a late-night address from his campaign headquarters in Manila, he thanked volunteers for months of “sacrifices and work” but stopped short of claiming victory. “Let’s wait until it’s very clear, until the count reaches a hundred percent then we can celebrate,” he said. Marcos Jr, 64, ran with the message “together we shall rise again”, invoking nostalgia for his father’s authoritarian regime, which the family and its supporters have portrayed as a golden era in a campaign fuelled by online disinformation. Social media has been flooded with false stories about the rule of Marcos Sr, which have swept aside atrocities and corruption that were widespread during the period. Such portrayals have horrified survivors of Marcos Sr’s brutal regime. Thousands of political opponents were tortured, arrested and disappeared under his rule, while as much as $10bn was plundered. Marcos Sr was ousted by the People Power revolution in 1986, when the family was humiliatingly airlifted from the presidential palace by helicopter, and fled into exile. Ever since, say analysts, the Marcoses have sought to rebrand their name and regain their place in politics. “The disinformation infrastructure has been there for a long time. It’s not as if it just sprouted during this campaign. The Marcoses’ plan to reach the presidency has been in action for decades,” said Aries Arugay, a visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, who is based in Manila. Marcos Jr had maintained a clear lead over his opponents in surveys conducted in the run-up to the vote, including Robredo, who ranked second. A former human rights lawyer who has advocated for marginalised groups, she campaigned on a promise of good governance and an end to corruption. People began lining up to vote before polling centres opened at 6am local time (2300 BST) on Monday morning, and some waited more than four hours in the heat. The vote follows three months of fierce campaigning, in which 2 million Robredo volunteers launched an unprecedented door-to-door campaign to try to win over voters and counter the onslaught of online disinformation. Although Marcos Jr has denied the presence of any organised online campaign, he was the overwhelming beneficiary of false claims circulating on social media. While Robredo and Marcos were subjects of false claims, disinformation about Robredo has been overwhelmingly negative. Disinformation spread about Marcos and his family was overwhelmingly designed to enhance his image. Marcos Jr’s candidacy has polarised opinion. At Santa Ana elementary school, in a residential area of Manila, which opened as a polling station, Raquel Deguzaman, 59, said she supported Marcos Jr and did not believe the family was corrupt. “[Marcos Sr] was able to help the Philippines. He’s really good,” she said, adding that he had built infrastructure, including hospitals. Marcos ran in tandem with Sara Duterte, who is vying for the vice-presidency. She also had a formidable lead with more than 23.3m votes in the unofficial count from the commission on elections’ server. The president and vice-president are elected separately in the Philippines. Cleo Anne A Calimbahin, an associate professor of political science at De La Salle University Manila, said the results should not come as a surprise but that they were sobering. They reflected in part a growing frustration among the public with previous administrations. “I think this is a response of a public that saw the lack of progress made since 1986,” said Calimbahin, referencing the People Power revolution that put the Philippines on the road to democracy, a process that has not been linear. “Unfortunately the reforms agenda and its inability to deliver since 1986 has made people even wary of reformist candidates,” said Calimbahin. Marcos Jr has avoided TV debates and challenging media interviews ahead of the election, and his campaign has been thin on policy detail.The election winner will take office on 30 June for a single, six-year term.",News/World news,Ferdinand Marcos Jr set to triumph in Philippines presidential election,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/ferdinand-marcos-jr-triumph-philippines-presidential-election
5/10/2022,"An Italian parliamentary committee has begun an investigation into the spread of disinformation, reportedly amid suspicions that some Russian commentators hosted on television networks could be on Vladimir Putin’s payroll. The probe by Copasir, a parliamentary committee for the security of Italy, was triggered after an outcry over a recent interview with Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Rete 4, a channel operated by the privately owned Mediaset. Enrico Borghi, a member of Copasir and politician with the centre-left Democratic party, confirmed an investigation was under way but would neither confirm nor deny a report in la Repubblica on Monday that at least three unnamed Russian guests on Italian TV were on the Kremlin’s payroll. Lavrov’s interview on 1 May, prompted a diplomatic row with Israel after the minister claimed that Adolf Hitler “had Jewish blood”. The screening coincided with the appearance of the prominent pro-Kremlin journalist, Vladimir Solovyev, on the rival channel, La7. “The fact they were both interviewed on the same night, by private networks, was really quite striking,” Borghi said. “But this investigation is not about censorship or limiting press freedom, but this so-called hybrid war of disinformation, interference, the production of fake news and influence, which are objective themes of Russian activities against Nato, and, in particular, against Italy. These elements have increased, unfortunately, in connection with the real war.” The committee will first hear Carlo Fuortes, CEO of the state-owned broadcaster, Rai, on 12 May, followed by Giacomo Lasorella, president of the media watchdog, Agcom, on 17 May. “Our task is to supervise the information service and security of the country. It’s in the context of this activity that we carry out our work,” added Borghi. Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Rai and other TV channels have regularly hosted Russian journalists to debate the war, sparking divisions between those who condemn the networks for giving space to “propagandists” and those who argue that it is right to air the opinions of those on both sides of the conflict. The matter came to a head when Lavrov was interviewed on Rete 4’s current affairs programme, Zona bianca, during which he dismissed the massacre in Bucha as fake news and accused the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who is Jewish, of being a Nazi. It was the first interview Lavrov had given to a European TV network since the beginning of the war. “It seems we are the only country whose talkshows host Russian figures every day,” said Riccardo Magi, a politician with the small leftwing party, Più Europa, said. “Probably, in their evaluation [Italy] has a major weakness, both from the point of view of the authoritativeness of independent information and public opinion; already this type of propaganda had been well infiltrated.”",News/World news,Italy launches inquiry into Kremlin disinformation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/italy-launches-inquiry-into-kremlin-disinformation
5/10/2022,"Latin America’s largest city, São Paulo, is reportedly planning to open a campsite for rough sleepers in response to a Covid-fuelled homelessness crisis that has forced thousands on to the streets. The homeless population in Brazil’s economic capital, which has about 12 million residents, grew by more than 30% during the coronavirus pandemic in what activists have called a humanitarian emergency. On Saturday morning one of São Paulo’s 31,000-plus homeless residents stood outside the city’s Museum of Sacred Art with a tatty sign that spoke to the scale of the social catastrophe. “Estou comendo do lixo,” it read. “I’m eating from the trash.” According to a report in one local newspaper on Monday, the city hall is now planning to create a campground where São Paulo’s homeless can erect tents and be given access to bathroom and laundry facilities. “The mayor has said that, given the acuteness of the city’s circumstances, money would not be an obstacle,” the city’s new human rights and citizenship secretary, Soninha Francine, told the Folha de São Paulo. Francine said it was an emergency that so many families were having to sleep rough because they could no longer afford to pay rent or for cooking gas. Official statistics reveal a dramatic situation in Brazil’s biggest city: according to São Paulo’s city hall, there were people living in tents and wooden shacks in nearly 6,800 different areas last year, compared with only about 2,000 two years earlier. Their inhabitants reportedly include a growing number of women, families and elderly citizens. Speaking in São Paulo on Saturday, Brazil’s former left-wing president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva denounced the social calamity blighting the country he governed from 2003 to 2011, with inflation soaring and 12 million unemployed. “Hunger has returned,” said Lula, as he announced his intention to challenge the incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, in October’s presidential election. Brazil’s hunger crisis was exposed last year by heart-wrenching photographs of down-and-outs scavenging through a heap of animal carcasses in a middle-class Rio de Janeiro neighbourhood, just a few minutes’ drive from its most famous beaches. “A governor who is incapable of shedding a single tear when there are humans rummaging through rubbish trucks for food, isn’t worthy of the title,” Lula said on Saturday, in reference to those shocking images. Brazil is not the only Latin American country grappling with the social fallout from a coronavirus pandemic that has plunged millions of citizens back into extreme poverty. The number of people living in extreme poverty in Latin America and the Caribbean rose from from 81 million to 86 million between 2020 and 2021, according to the United Nations.",News/World news,São Paulo reportedly plans campsite following 30% increase in homelessness,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/sao-paulo-reportedly-plans-campsite-increase-homelessness
5/10/2022,"For Keir Starmer’s team, Beergate has proven to be a bonfire of delusions. It may well be that Durham police, which took no action over Dominic Cummings’ eye-testing sojourn to Barnard Castle, absolves the Labour leader over lockdown beers and curry after a campaign event last year. Even so, this episode offers salutary lessons. The whole shtick of Starmer’s team is that the grownups are back in the room. Jeremy Corbyn and his team, they believed, were fundamentally bad at politics, and brought rightwing media attacks on themselves, the thrust of which Starmer’s team believed were largely justified anyway. And so, the plan? Place a knight of the realm – a former director of public prosecutions at that – in the top job, surround him with seasoned political professionals, punch left with gleeful abandon, and rid the party of any radical policy aspirations, thus neutering the sense that Labour represents a dangerous challenge to the status quo. They sought instead to make his dividing lines with the government competence and honesty, a seemingly easy feat when your opponent has all the integrity of a soggy beer mat. What could go wrong? Well, quite a lot, actually. Up until now, Starmer’s team has enjoyed the easiest ride from the British media of any Labour leader since Tony Blair, and yet the first serious, sustained attack from the rightwing press is threatening to engulf them. Indeed, Starmer’s faltering media performances under pressure do not bode well for a general election campaign in which the Tory party and press will behave like uncaged lions. Labour’s current plight partly arises from an unheeded past lesson. Upon assuming the leadership, focusing on competence may have seemed the obvious bet for Starmer, but this advantage was soon undermined by the successful vaccine rollout. It would have made sense to pivot to a transformative vision to tackle the cost of living crisis, but Starmer’s team concluded that they could bet the house on integrity and decency instead. Nothing that Starmer is accused of comes close to the misdemeanours committed in Boris Johnson’s No 10. That pattern of behaviour was a brazen insult to relatives of the pandemic’s victims, and took place under a more severe lockdown than the step 2 restrictions in place in Durham in spring 2021. The problem for Starmer isn’t actually Johnson’s behaviour, but rather the fate of Rishi Sunak. The chancellor’s prime ministerial ambitions were essentially terminated because he turned up early to an official meeting and ate some birthday cake. Sunak was fined for this really very minor transgression, and Starmer’s position was that he should resign. By imposing such a low threshold for resignation – and bear in mind the Labour leader called for Johnson’s resignation simply for being under police investigation, now his own predicament – Starmer dug himself an avoidably deep pit. His team may believe this all terribly unfair – and they are right. The whole saga of politicians’ lockdown restriction violations has acted like a clarifying flare, exposing how media outlets arbitrarily decide when an event becomes a scandal. Johnson’s now infamous birthday party was reported at the time in the Times, yet was only portrayed as wrongdoing 18 months later. Footage of Beergate circulated for months on social media before the Tory press decided it was useful fodder in the run-up to local elections. But there is nothing Starmer can do about the unfair media ecosystem he finds himself in – as he has now presumably discovered, given all he has done in his leadership to placate the press. If he had focused on eye-catching, cut-through policies to raise living standards – rather than fiddling around the edges with modest cuts to energy bills – he would not find himself so exposed. It would be truly perverse if Starmer were forced to resign over a small dishonesty regarding a takeaway curry – given the much larger political dishonesty of which he’s guilty. What am I referring to? It is true that Johnson is on another planet when it comes to lying. But his premiership is broadly consistent with what he promised in his Tory leadership and general election campaigns – the hike to national insurance being a glaring exception. Starmer, on the other hand, ran for the leadership of the Labour party on what must be one of the most duplicitous campaigns in modern British political history. His offer was radical (and popular) domestic policies combined with party unity: Corbynism without Corbyn. He now offers Blairism without Blair. It would have been as if Johnson used his 2019 election victory to rejoin the EU. But Starmer’s transparent political dishonesty has been ignored – because those on the receiving end were ordinary members of the Labour party and the party’s left, who are not regarded as legitimate political actors. His most generous cheerleaders are largely not interested in the substance of politics, but aesthetics and style. Their main objection to Johnson’s government is that it is uncouth and embarrassing, and they have projected on to Starmerthe integrity and decency that they hanker after. Like many of Joe Biden’s most militant champions in 2020, they simply hope he will make politics boring again, a dream that, to put it gently, has not been realised across the Atlantic. Again, perhaps Starmer will survive all this, even as he declared in a Monday afternoon press conference that he would resign if issued with a fixed penalty notice – placing the fate of the leader of the opposition in the hands of the Durham constabulary. He has left himself some wriggle room if the police find, like Cummings, he may have violated the regulations but issue no fine. Whatever happens, this episode has underlined the fatal weaknesses of his operation. His team has avoided making the argument for transformative policies, which this country vitally needs, because even if they believed them to be politically desirable they fear that doing so will invite a media onslaught. But it didn’t matter; the press has unleashed mayhem on him anyway. If only his team had read more Greek tragedies, they’d have learned that hubris is invariably followed by nemesis.
