A group of Apple employees is planning to walk off their jobs on Christmas Eve and are urging a customer boycott on the day â€” when much last-minute shopping takes place. The worker advocacy group Apple Together called for a walkout on Twitter. Their demands include a more respectful workplace and paid sick time. It also urged customers to ""demand that Apple upholds its image with your wallet. Don't shop in stores. Don't shop online."" According to information on its website, most Apple stores in the US are open until 6 p.m. on Christmas Eve and closed on Christmas Day. The Apple Together tweet also informed workers who walk off that they can apply for strike funds via the Coworker Solidarity Fund, a nonprofit. According to the fund's webpage, it's now accepting only waitlist applications for stipends of up to $5,000. The tech sector faces increased employee activism around toxic work conditions and environments. In June, about 80 Apple employees pushed back after the company announced its return-to-office policy would require them back in the workplace by September, The Verge reported. The company last week pushed back its return-to-office indefinitely due to the spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.

Apple didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.
