1/2/2022,"Former President Donald Trump will hold a press conference at Mar-A-Lago on the anniversary of the Capitol riot. Alyssa Farah, who worked for the former president, told CNN that this shows he is getting ""terrible advice."" It would be a ""wise day"" for him to stay silent, Farah added. Former President Donald Trump, who plans to hold a press conference on the anniversary of the Capitol riot, is getting ""terrible advice"" from his inner circle, said a former aide. Trump would be better off remaining silent on January 6, said Alyssa Farah, who worked for the former president as the White House's director of strategic communications. ""The former president has also announced he'll be hosting a press conference that day which, I think if anything proves he's still getting terrible advice from folks around him,"" said Farah, during an interview with CNN's Kaitlin Collins, per a report by the Independent. ""This would be a wise day for him to stay silent, to let those who were victims on Capitol Hill talk about that very important and solemn day,"" Farah continued. Trump is likely to use the press conference to push election fraud conspiracies, Farah added. ""I think instead you'll hear a very sort of, you know, the tone from him that this was — reiterating the lies that the election was stolen, saying that those who are being tried for the insurrection are political prisoners,"" she said. The former president will hold the press conference from his Mar-a-Lago resort on January 6 — one year after the deadly insurrection at the Capitol. In a statement announcing the event, The Hill reported that he baselessly described Election Day as the ""insurrection"" and inaccurately referred to January 6 as ""a completely unarmed protest of the rigged election."" NPR notes that Capitol rioters came armed, bringing stun guns, pepper spray, and baseball bats with them. While Trump speaks from Mar-a-Lago, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that her office instead intends to hold a ""prayerful vigil"" among other reflective events.

1/2/2022,"A former military general took aim at MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell in a recent CNN interview. Steven M. Anderson suggested that Trump supporters should ""stop listening to the pillow guy."" Instead, they should educate themselves on how elections work, he said. Retired military general Steven M. Anderson blasted MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell in an interview, while warning of the existence of Trump supporters within the military. Anderson, who served in the US Army for 31 years, spoke on Saturday to CNN's Pamela Brown about the upcoming 2024 elections and solutions to address the ""extremism that has gone on within the military."" Lindell has become well known for spreading baseless voter fraud claims, which Anderson alluded to during the interview. The former general urged people to ignore such claims and ""stop listening to the Pillow Guy"" in an effort to educate themselves about how elections work. Anderson made the reference to Lindell while discussing what he described as a threat within the military. ""We've got some people that just haven't been educated. They haven't been found out, and they've grown in power through perhaps inaction on the parts of some of our key leaders,"" he said during the interview. ""We need to do what we can do now to identify those people [within the military], get them out of our ranks, and train the rest of the force on civics one on one about how our country is supposed to work, how elections work, stop listening to the pillow guy [Lindell] and start learning about our country and how it's actually supposed to run,"" he added. Lindell has claimed his first encounter with Trump back in 2016 came about through ""divine appointments."" The business mogul often appears on TV, radio shows, and podcasts, where he repeats claims that the 2020 election was stolen from former president Donald Trump, without providing any evidence. He's also held various events, including a ""cyber symposium"" and a 96-hour marathon ""Thanks-a-Thon"" livestream in November, in a bid to convince more people that voter fraud did occur. There is no proof, however, of widespread voter fraud. Recently, he told Insider's Cheryl Teh that he'd spent $25 million trying to overturn the 2020 election and was willing to spend everything he had and ""sell everything"" for his cause.
