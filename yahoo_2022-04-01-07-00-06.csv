A Ukrainian army lieutenant said Russian soldiers are fighting ""stupidly"" and without strategy as President Vladimir Putin's forces continue to make little military progress in their five-week-long war in the eastern European country. ""The Russians are fighting stupidly,"" Second Lt. Tatiana Chornovol, a former politician, told CBS News in an interview that aired on Thursday. ""They don't have a strategy or tactics — they're falling into the same traps and their commanders are just pushing them to advance."" Volunteer Ukrainian soldier Andriy Rogalski criticized Russia's attacks on Ukrainian cities in his own interview with CBS News. ""It's pure evil what they did,"" Rogalski, who said he worked as a crane operator and received just two weeks of basic training before heading to war, told CBS News. Russia's defense ministry said earlier this week it would scale down attacks in the northern part of Ukraine, as it planned to withdraw forces from around Kyiv and redirect focus on the eastern Donbas region. The US and Ukraine have expressed skepticism with Russia's claim — which comes amid ongoing peace negotiations — and said troop movement is likely a redeployment rather than a withdrawal.

4/1/2022,"Suave products from the 24-Hour Protection Aerosol Antiperspirant line are being recalled. The FDA explains the recall is due to “elevated levels of benzene,” which is a known carcinogen. If you are in possession of these products, the FDA urges you to discontinue use and discard them immediately. Unilever, the manufacturer of Suave brand products, issued a voluntary recall of two of the brand’s deodorants yesterday. The products are being recalled due to the “presence of slightly elevated levels of benzene,” according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Two Suave 24-Hour Protection Aerosol Antiperspirants are included in the recall: Suave 24-Hour Protection Aerosol Antiperspirant Powder and Suave 24-Hour Protection Aerosol Antiperspirant Fresh. The recall includes all Suave 24-Hour Protection Aerosol Antiperspirant Powder and Suave 24-Hour Protection Aerosol Antiperspirant Fresh products with an expiration date through September 2023. The FDA also explains that “no other Unilever or Suave products are in the scope of this recall.” Anybody in possession of these products should discontinue use and discard products immediately. Appropriate benzene product disposal varies by state, according to Valisure, but it is generally advised to consult your local hazardous waste collection program. A Unilever review of the affected products revealed the presence of benzene in some product samples, which was attributed to the propellant that sprays the product from the can rather than the product ingredients themselves. Benzene is “classified as a human carcinogen,” or cancer-causing ingredient, according to the FDA. Benzene can enter the human body orally, topically, or by inhalation and can cause various forms of cancer. The FDA has previously established an acceptable level of Benzene in drug products at 2 ppm, and products above this threshold are not suitable for distribution. Thankfully, product review reveals that “daily exposure to benzene in the recalled products at the levels detected” is not expected to cause negative health effects. But, it is still best to stop use and dispose of the affected deodorants immediately. The recalled items were previously in limited distribution due to the discontinuation of the line in October 2021 for “business reasons.” All retailers have nonetheless been alerted to remove the recalled items from shelves immediately. If you have questions about the recall or would like to request reimbursement for the purchase of the affected products, you can visit the Suave recall website. You should also talk to your physician if you have any health concerns related to using the products involved in the recall.
