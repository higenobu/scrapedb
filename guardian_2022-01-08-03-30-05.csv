1/8/2022,"Simon Jenkins rightly derides the notion of the Church of England as “a national corporation of grandees”, for if the church exists at all, in any meaningful sense, it’s at the local, parochial level (Churches could double as banks, or even serve beer. We can’t leave them empty, 31 December). But this is where Jenkins wrongly, in my view, elides two similar terms: congregation and community. The local church “congregation” consists just of those who actively worship in the church building – and in rural contexts it’s often a very small number indeed. The “community”, however, is the much wider population of the parish – the parishioners, all those who live within the parish boundary. Our task in the rural church – if we are to survive locally – is to help revive a sense of popular, community ownership, both of the church building and of the heritage of faith and values it represents.  This means setting out not to “convert” people in the parish, but rather help them to own their church, both as sacred space and common ground – a locus of human meaning. Philip Larkin was on to this in his elegiac Church Going: “A serious house on serious earth it is, / In whose blent air all our compulsions meet, / Are recognised, and robed as destinies.”Rev Dr John CaperonCrowborough, East Sussex  Simon Jenkins rightly advocates ways in which redundant churches can be restored and converted for use by charities and social enterprises, but makes no mention of the Churches Conservation Trust (CCT), which does just this. With 356 such churches in its care, it initiates and manages a range of projects that not only inject new life into these buildings, but also funds and protects jobs in the heritage construction sector and underpins the work of specialist professionals and crafts people, many of whom have lost their jobs during the pandemic; a prime example being in Sunderland, where the work has generated much local interest and participation by young people who would otherwise be unemployed. With its experienced staff and expertise in this highly complex area, the CCT is ideally equipped to save and promote these buildings for use by their local communities. All it needs now is proper government funding and better publicity of its work to enable it to apply its innovative approach on a much larger scale.Andrew HillierLondon  Simon Jenkins is absolutely right about the strong historic ties between a community and its local church buildings, even if no longer used as places of worship. Not only are these the places where so many were christened, wed, or buried – many (like ours) are also fine buildings that deserve to go on being used and loved by the communities in which they are rooted. Here in Stannington, we are battling to save the former Knowle Top Methodist chapel for our community – to rescue our after-school club and brass band rehearsal space, and to create a fabulous new arts and performance venue that will make best use of the historic tiered seating in its calm and beautiful interior.Jenny van TinterenStannington, Sheffield  I was interested to read Simon Jenkins’ article regarding the use of church buildings. In our rural parish of Mursley, we have indeed opened “The Church Arms”. Sparked by the boarding up of our village pub in October, the church opened the door to meet a community need for a place to catch up with other villagers and have a light-hearted or more serious chat. This project has been fully supported by the diocese of Oxford. Judging by the response to our venture, I would encourage other churches to experiment. It’s not all about booze either, we are offering a soup and cake lunch at other times.Andrew CowellMursley, Milton Keynes  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

1/8/2022,"For readers whose formative years were enriched by the after-school teatime TV experience, the revival of two coming-of-age classics may be sparking a sudden rush of nostalgia. This week, in an interview with the Guardian, Sir Phil Redmond disclosed that he is updating Grange Hill, the greatest school soap of them all, for a one-off movie version set in the present day. Meanwhile, in America, Disney has rebooted the equally admired The Wonder Years, but with the twist that this time it chronicles the vicissitudes of childhood and adolescence through the eyes of a black boy living in Alabama. Bringing these two televisual gems back to life necessarily entails substantial reinterpretation; the impact of social media, for example, will loom large in the Grange Hill of 2022. But those who witnessed Tricia Yates using a wooden ruler to exact revenge on Tucker Jenkins, in the very first of 601 episodes in 1978, will hope the spirit of the original is kept intact.  Sir Phil, who was 29 when that scene was broadcast, is now 72. He is unfazed by the idea of writing a script for a quite different era in which to be young. “Childhood doesn’t really change,” he told the Guardian, “what changes are fashion, haircuts and slang … the actors bring you what’s right at the time.” Since his fictional London comprehensive closed its gates in 1998, successor dramas such as Waterloo Road, Skins and Sex Education have skilfully mined some of the territory that Grange Hill opened up. But for sheer daring, and in the context of its time, Sir Phil’s creation remains in a class of its own. Launched in the pre-Thatcher era, Grange Hill captivated its young audience by grittily portraying the life of a school from their point of view (cameras were even positioned to film at the children’s eyeline). Issues such as bullying, pornography and period pain were treated with a realism that provoked tabloid headlines and parental disquiet. The show’s examination of the dangers of drug abuse led to an invitation to visit Nancy Reagan in the White House. For millions, Grange Hill held up an invaluable mirror to their own daily experience, allowing its challenges to be navigated more easily. The prospect of new and talented school-age actors bringing this long backstory into the Covid era is fascinating; as is the relocation of the gentle lyricism of The Wonder Years from white suburbia to the world of a black 12-year-old in 1968 – where an argument about baseball is interrupted by news of the assassination of Martin Luther King. In the sixth and final series of the original Wonder Years, the middle-aged narrator reflects on a bittersweet New Year’s Eve in 1973, when the adolescent Kevin Arnold crosses the Rubicon into young adulthood. “The future was calling us … there was no turning back now,” says Kevin. That time to put away childish things comes to us all, of course. But reinterpreted and reflected upon, the past can deliver more than just nostalgia, and enlighten us in the present.

1/8/2022,"How refreshing to hear a GP recognising that recovering from illness may depend on going “off-piste”, leaving “the well-trimmed paths of textbook solutions” in favour of “something wilder, more unscripted and perhaps more effective” (‘We need to respect the process of healing’: a GP on the overlooked art of recovery, 4 January). My perspective is hospital medicine and surgery, in which many patients never reach their potential after illness. NHS trusts, eager to empty beds, often invest in specialist rehabilitation units where a small proportion of patients with especially complex needs are put through multi-disciplinary, goal-directed programmes. The vast majority of ill people, by contrast, are hurried home in the expectation that spontaneous healing will somehow work its magic.  Even though I devoted my medical career to rehabilitation, I suspect that poor outcomes among NHS patients are due less to a shortage of equipment or therapy than to a failure of imagination. As the article’s author, Dr Gavin Francis, says, the meanings of illness and wellness differ vastly from person to person. Rehabilitation protocols are no substitute for imagination, and nor are routinely prescribed discharge care-packages. In healthcare’s rule-bound culture, it is hard to find the courage to stray from well-trimmed paths.Christopher WardEmeritus professor of rehabilitation medicine, University of Nottingham  Dr Francis sounds like an intuitive and creative GP. He likes to describe illnesses as stories of the mind and body. He lists many non-medical solutions that help medical problems – to which I would add the benefits of talking, particularly sharing stories with people with similar medical problems. Royal Stoke university hospital and former patient volunteers run such a group for oesophagogastrostomy patients and their carers/partners. The meetings are a safe place where stories of the mind and body of one person help the convalescence of another. My husband, who had such major surgery three years ago, gains much from being able to share anecdotes with those at an earlier stage in their treatment, and from talking to those who had the operation many years before him. It is striking that many surgeons see the benefits too, as usually one or more of them attend the meetings.Annie CoombsNantwich, Cheshire  As a retired GP, Dr Francis’s piece is music to my ears.

1/8/2022,"David Olusoga’s article (Britain’s shameful slavery history matters – that’s why a jury acquitted the Colston Four, 6 January) misses an essential question. There have been instances in recent decades of juries finding defendants not guilty when the facts of an offence appear clear. Examples are Clive Ponting (1984) and Pat Pottle and Michael Randle (1991). In 2004 the prosecution, presumably fearing the same, offered no evidence in Katharine Gun’s case.  The parallel factor in each of those cases was that the catalyst had been a shaming decision by our own authorities as immediate background – deceit about the sinking of the Belgrano (Ponting), prosecuting 25 years after the event because initial errors had been exposed (Pottle and Randle) and scrapping standards of probity to be in line with the US (Gun). In this case there was no parallel. The options for Bristol council on how to deal with Colston’s statue were matters for debate. The catalyst was a murder committed by a US policeman. So the question is raised – where does one draw the line? I do not have an answer, but in any democratic society it is important that what citizens can do without being penalised criminally should be predictable.Peter DavisWelwyn, Hertfordshire  The acquittal of the four people in Bristol leaves a somewhat bitter taste in my mouth. Regardless of the rights and wrongs of pulling down the statue of a figure from history who benefited from slavery, taking the law into your own hands is never the right way to proceed.

1/8/2022,"A government department is facing questions over an apparent failure to disclose that Liz Truss and three officials spent more than £2,000 of public money on meals and drinks during a three-night trip to Tokyo. The bill relates to a visit by Truss, who was then trade secretary, to Japan in October 2020 to sign the UK’s first post-Brexit trade agreement, which she lauded at the time as an “historic moment” for both countries.  The Department for International Trade (DIT) had initially stated in a parliamentary answer to Labour that Truss and three members of staff who travelled with her had spent £182.74 of public money on refreshments. However, after a Freedom of Information request by the shadow attorney general, Emily Thornberry, it has now emerged that the party in fact spent £2,080.44 of public money on food and drink. “There is a clear pattern of behaviour emerging here with Liz Truss, which raises serious questions about her character,” Thornberry told the Daily Mirror. “Because if her instinct is to hide the truth and hope that no one asks questions even over these expenses claims, what else is she willing to do that about?” The Department for International Trade and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office have been approached for comment. Questions about the Japan trip, which Truss made between 21 and 24 October 2020, follow separate questions about spending associated with Truss, who has emerged as one of the contenders to succeed Boris Johnson as leader of the Conservative party. Earlier this week, Labour called on the government to explain why it claimed Truss hosted a £3,000 lunch at a private members’ club because it was available at short notice, when correspondence later showed that she had insisted on the venue. In a letter to the international trade minister, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the party also asked why Truss, Trevelyan’s predecessor in the role, had overruled civil servants’ concerns about the cost of the members’ club, owned by a Tory donor. Correspondence disclosed by the Sunday Times showed that Truss “refused to consider anywhere else” and asked that public funds pay for the event with Joe Biden’s trade representative. Truss was said to have “explicitly asked that we book 5 Hertford Street”, owned by Robin Birley, a £20,000 donor to Johnson’s leadership campaign and the half-brother of Zac Goldsmith, the environment minister. Before attending the event with US trade representatives, a civil servant described the club as “obviously incredibly expensive and more than I understand we’d usually expect to pay for such a venue”. It was requested, the official wrote, as the private dining room was “of the appropriate size and standing”. Truss and her companions drank two measures of dry gin; three bottles of Pazo Barrantes Albariño, a Spanish white wine, costing a total of £153; and two bottles of the French red Coudoulet de Beaucastel, costing a total of £130, it was reported. A spokesperson for the department described the event as a diplomatic working dinner.",News/Politics,Trade department questioned over food and drink bill for Liz Truss Japan trip,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/07/trade-department-questioned-over-food-and-drink-bill-for-liz-truss-japan-trip
1/8/2022,"I was interested to see the prices paid by Liz Truss at a luncheon “event” at 5 Hertford Street (Liz Truss asked for public money to cover £3,000 lunch, 2 January). As of 4 January, independent wine merchants were offering Coudoulet de Beaucastel rouge at £19.99 to £22.23 per 75cl bottle, and Pazo Barrantes Albariño at £17.50 to £18.33, compared with Ms Truss’s expenditure of £130 for two bottles of the former and £153 for three of the latter – out of the public purse. The proprietor of the establishment concerned was a donor to Boris Johnson’s leadership campaign and is related to a Conservative life peer and current minister. What faith can we have in Ms Truss’s judgment in her role as foreign secretary when it comes to striking international trade deals?

Would Ms Truss benefit from a crash course in restaurant wine price inflation?Dr Jonathan PuntLondon   You report that, in the pursuit of a chimerical trade deal, Liz Truss “paid” £153 for three bottles of Albariño.

1/8/2022,"Trade union leaders are urging ministers to delay making Covid vaccination mandatory for NHS personnel because the feared exodus it will trigger will worsen the health service’s staffing crisis. The government has decided that all NHS staff in England who have direct contact with patients must have had their first dose of a Covid vaccine by 3 February or risk losing their job at the end of March.  But the TUC has called for the policy to be delayed “with immediate effect”, to avoid the loss of staff it will create deepening the health service-wide shortage of key workers which is a key reason why dozens of NHS trusts have had to declare a major alert over the last week. The TUC is warning the health secretary, Sajid Javid, that pressing ahead with the plan “will exacerbate this crisis, creating a bureaucratic and staffing nightmare for NHS trusts and making it impossible to maintain safe staffing levels in the coming weeks”. Javid, who has already imposed the requirement on staff working in care homes in England, believes that compulsory jabs for NHS staff will help keep patients safe and reduce the number of people who contract Covid while in hospital. Frances O’Grady, the TUC’s general secretary, said: “We are in the middle of an NHS staffing crisis, born not only from Covid absences but also long-term problems that need long-term solutions. Now is not the right time to introduce more bureaucracy. “As hospitals declare critical incidents amid a surge in Covid cases, the NHS cannot afford to lose experienced and skilled staff”. The NHS already has 93,000 vacancies, including for 40,000 nurses. The government’s own impact assessment of its policy concluded that as many as 73,000 staff may leave rather than get jabbed. Women, people from ethnic minorities and younger workers are among those most likely to quit. The Guardian reported last month that Chris Hopson, the chief executive of the hospitals body NHS Providers, feared that entire units of hospitals may have to close “in extreme circumstances” as a result of the departure of unvaccinated staff. He cited an unnamed maternity unit where 40 midwives are refusing to get jabbed and whose stance had left the trust’s boss seriously concerned for the future viability of the service if they left, given that the NHS in England is short of about 2,500 midwives. O’Grady issued her plea hours after new official data showed that the NHS in England is grappling with the highest number of Covid absences since the vaccine programme began 13 months ago, with more than 40,000 staff unable to attend work on two days in the past week. The disclosure prompted claims that hospitals are “simply not safe”. An average of 35,596 staff were sick with Covid in the past week, a level last seen in January 2021 at the height of the second wave of the pandemic and higher than any week since all priority groups were offered at least their first vaccine in mid-February. The UK reported a further 178,250 Covid cases on Friday, bringing the total for the past seven days to 1,260,535, up 20% compared with the total for the week before. However, the daily figure is lower than those recorded in recent days, with 179,756 cases reported on Thursday and 194,747 on Wednesday. On Wednesday Sir David Nicholson, the former chief executive of NHS England who is now the chair of the Sandwell and West Birmingham hospitals trust, said that it could lose hundreds of staff as a result of mandatory vaccination. “My understanding on vaccines is that, though we may not put it in these terms, we will essentially be giving unvaccinated staff notice at the start of February. “I am sure that’s not quite the right way of putting it but that is the inexorable logic of where we are.” The Homerton hospital trust in east London said last month that its bosses “remain worried” that conversations with unvaccinated staff to persuade them to get immunised “haven’t made an impact yet”. Tom Nettel, the trust’s director of people, told a board meeting: “Unfortunately, if we are not able to vaccinate them, and they do not feel comfortable to do so, we may be faced with an outcome of dismissal.”",News/Society,Ministers urged to delay mandatory Covid jabs for NHS staff in England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/07/ministers-urged-to-delay-mandatory-covid-jabs-for-nhs-staff-in-england
1/8/2022,"As a young kid, there really weren’t many black figures to aspire to, to mould yourself to. I was always glued to the telly and one night my dad put on this film, In the Heat of the Night. I will always remember the moment when Sidney Poitier came on screen as Virgil Tibbs. Seeing any black person on TV was extraordinary, but seeing someone with such ability, such grace, such style, changed me. I knew how bad racism was in the US at that time, and watching that film I feared for this black character in that world. But there’s a moment where an older white gentleman, Endicott, slaps Tibbs, and he immediately slaps him back in the face. There was an audible gasp in our living room, quickly followed by cheers. It was a thing we’d never seen before – he was standing up, he was strong, and he wasn’t taking any shit.  It was revolutionary for me as a young black man to see that sort of defiance in the face of overt racism, a defiance that was mirrored in Poitier’s role in the civil rights movement and his humanitarian work. I was quite ashamed at the time of how scared racism, and even the thought of being racially abused, made me feel. So to have him stand there as this kind of gladiator, unafraid to strike this old white man back, was groundbreaking. I’m emotional even thinking about it. Poitier at the time was playing the kind of roles that people still aren’t even writing in England today. I still haven’t played one, even at this point in my career. It’s incredible that America even back then had black characters imbued with such beauty and charm – almost disarming the view of what black actors or black people were capable of. To Sir, with Love, Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner – Poitier’s roles in those films mirrored my own experiences, because I grew up in a moment when assimilation was the theme of the day. This was followed by a much more forthright, much more in-your-face version of what black people were like in the blaxploitation films of the 1970s, which Poitier himself fell victim to, to some extent, but he remained for me this graceful figure who was beloved by everyone. Looking at the tributes pouring in from black actors, it’s clear how he inspired all of us to rethink what was possible. Every time I go onstage, every time I make a film or TV programme, he is one of my leading lights. I bumped into him at the Golden Globes many years ago. Two months before I had been skint, but then I got the part in Homeland, and was whisked off into this world of fame. I was looking around at all these stars, and then I turned around and there he was. I leaped out of my chair and charged across the room. He must have thought I was a complete fruitcake, but he was graceful and generous as I bleated out how much I admired him. I shook his hand – an experience I will never forget.

1/8/2022,"The risk of conflict is real as Russia continues to mass its forces and artillery on the borders of Ukraine and make demands that it knows are unacceptable, Jens Stoltenberg, the Nato secretary general, has warned. Earlier, Nato foreign ministers held a final symbolic display of transatlantic unity before a set of three separate critical talks next week with Russia on Moscow’s demands to restore past spheres of influence and have Nato strategic weapons withdrawn from near Russia’s borders.  Russia has threatened to invade Ukraine unless its demands – also including a guarantee that Ukraine will never be permitted to join Nato – are met. Stoltenberg said: “The Russian military buildup has not stopped. It is gradually building up with artillery and electronic warfare equipment.” He vowed that Nato would never withdraw its conditional offer of membership to Ukraine, saying the true threat to Russia was Ukraine’s secure democratic politics. He also said that in the event of a Russian invasion there would be a major movement of troops to protect Nato countries on the border of Russia. The Nato show of strength was intended as a message to Vladimir Putin that he will be unable to lure the US into any concessions in separate bilateral talks about Ukraine’s sovereignty or Nato’s future structure. Although Stoltenberg said Nato was prepared to discuss issues such as troop transparency, western officials are sceptical that next week’s round of talks will lead to a breakthrough and believe the demands Putin set out on 17 December in the form of two draft treaties have been framed to be rejected. “We are ready to engage in arms control with Russia, conventional and nuclear, but that has to be reciprocal,” Stoltenberg said. “That’s a different thing [from] imposing one-sided restrictions … we can’t end up in a situation where we have second-class Nato members where Nato as an alliance is not allowed to protect them.” Nato is adamant that its conditional offer of membership to Georgia and Ukraine, first made in 2008, will not be withdrawn, even if in practice membership is not imminent. Both countries have been invited to attend part of a meeting of Nato defence ministers next month. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said: “Russia’s military buildup on the border of Ukraine and in illegally annexed Crimea is unacceptable. There is no justification for its aggressive and unprovoked stance towards Ukraine. We stand with our Nato allies in urging Russia to end its malign activity and adhere to international agreements it freely signed up to. “We will defend democracy in eastern Europe and around the world. Our support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity is unwavering. We are clear that any Russian incursion would be a massive strategic mistake, for which there would be a severe cost.” UK officials remain unclear whether Putin will invade, but they appear increasingly focused on strengthening forward defences inside Nato. The west has promised massive economic sanctions against Russia if an incursion occurs, but it has ruled out sending troops – as opposed to arms – into Ukraine. The round of talks start on Monday with a bilateral meeting in Geneva between US and Russian officials over future security structures. This will be followed by a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday of the Nato Russian council, the first such meeting for two years, and finally a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) chaired by Poland in Vienna. Western officials suggested the dispatch of a few thousand Russian troops to suppress the rebellion in Kazakhstan would not alter Putin’s military calculations, even if it represents an unexpected political headache for Moscow. The French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, said Putin was trying to discuss with Nato proposals “to sort of return to the zones of influence from the past … which would mean Russia restore the spirit of Yalta” – a reference to the conference between second world war allied powers in February 1945 that gave the Soviet Union control over its eastern European neighbours. “This is not our point of view, but we have to accept the discussion,” Le Drian said. Senior French and German diplomats met Russian counterparts in Moscow on Thursday as part of efforts to revive talks over eastern Ukraine. There have been reports that Emmanuel Macron and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, want to meet Putin, raising fears of freelance diplomatic operations. But Macron, who has rowed with the US over its security plans in south-east Asia, said the consultation with the US over Russia had been exemplary. British officials also insisted the US had been very consistent in saying it would not talk about Europe without Europe, or about Ukraine without Ukraine.",News/World news,Nato chief warns of real risk of Ukraine conflict as Russian buildup continues,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/nato-chief-warns-of-real-risk-of-ukraine-conflict-as-russian-buildup-continues
1/8/2022,"The richest 1% of households in the UK each have fortunes of at least £3.6m, according to new official figures that show the inequality gap was yawning even before the pandemic struck. At the other end of the scale, the poorest 10% of households have just £15,400 or less, with almost half burdened with more debts than they had in assets, according to figures released on Friday by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).  It means the gap between rich and poor has widened to the largest in more than a decade. The ONS said the income inequality gap as measured by the Gini coefficient had “steadily increased to 36.3%”, which was “the highest level of income inequality since 2010”. A Gini coefficient of 0% represents total equality where everyone has the same and 100% represents total inequality, where one person owns all the wealth. “The gap between the richest in society and the rest of the population has widened over the 10-year period,” the ONS said. “The wealthiest 10% of households held 43% of all the wealth in Great Britain in the latest period; in comparison, the bottom 50% held only 9%.” Of the UK’s estimated 27.8m households, there are just 263,000 in the top 1%. The ONS figures released on Friday cover the financial year to the end of March 2020, and economists said the gap between rich and poor is likely to have increased further during the pandemic as the already wealthy benefited from soaring stock markets. More than 258,000 British people became millionaires last year, according to research by investment bank Credit Suisse, taking the total number in the UK to a record 2.5m. Robert Palmer, executive director of lobbying group Tax Justice UK, said: “Even before the pandemic it was clear that wealth inequality was entrenched. Since Covid hit the wealthy have seen their riches grow, while those with less have struggled.” Krishan Shah, researcher at the Resolution Foundation, said: “With limited financial resources to protect them from economic shocks, the poorest households were undoubtedly in the worst position heading in to the pandemic. Policymakers need to help those worst-affected build financial resilience ahead of future shocks.” The median average household wealth across the country was £302,500, only a marginal increase on previous years. However, the report revealed stark divisions between the old versus the young, the south compared with the north, and the gulf between white people and those of other ethnicities. In families where the head of the household was aged 55 or over and still in work, the average household income was £553,400. “The wealth of this group was 25 times higher than those aged 16 to 24 years,” the ONS said. In the south-east, median household wealth was £503,400, up 43% since 2006 when adjusting for inflation. While in north-east England median wealth was £168,500, which the ONS said was lower than in 2006. Arun Advani, an assistant professor at the University of Warwick’s economics department, said the data revealed “stark” differences between different ethnic groups. “Households whose ‘household reference person’ is of white ethnicity are four times more likely to have wealth in excess of £500,000 than households with a black African HRP,” he said. Advani also said ONS data was likely to vastly underestimate the share of wealth going to the richest households because the data does not include business wealth, and because “the very wealthy do not tend to respond to such surveys”.",Lifestyle/Money,Richest 1% of UK households are worth at least £3.6m each,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/07/richest-uk-households-worth-at-least-36m-each
