5/6/2022,"Three years after Karen Bardsley tore a hamstring tendon off the bone in England’s World Cup quarter-final defeat of Norway it has forced her retirement perhaps a little earlier than planned. “It needed to be repaired and, unfortunately, the repair and the rehab fell right in the midst of the pandemic; and it just never seemed to be right,” the goalkeeper says. “We tried our best and I just never seem to fully recover. I went for a brief stint on loan to OL Reign [in Seattle] and kind of found a new love for the game again out there. But yeah, unfortunately, the tendon went again and it just never was the same again after that. “So, after a few more surgeries, it just got to the point basically where I wasn’t going to be happy with my level, and I wasn’t going to be happy with not living up to my expectations.” The bigger picture played a role as well: “Let’s just say I’m not getting any younger, and the risks started to outweigh the reward.” Bardsley joined Manchester City in 2013 and, born in California to Mancunian parents, it was a chance of sorts to go home. On Wednesday she was celebrated on the pitch after City’s last home game of the season. City are not in the title hunt but Champions League football is in their hands and, having collected the Continental League Cup in March and with an FA Cup final a week on Sunday, there is a chance to end the season on a big high after a tough start. “Obviously being injured means that won’t be a true gear-up,” Bardsley says of the Wembley final. “But being involved in the entire day is going to be really special, not only for me but I think for the girls, for the club. “The way the season started, to see the way it’s come to a close, we kind of wish we had just a few more weeks left. Getting the trophy and beating Chelsea at Wembley in the FA Cup final would just be a really, really nice way to close out the season and my career.” Bardsley has had huge successes, playing 82 times for England, going to seven major international tournaments and competing with Team GB at the London 2012 Olympic Games. The injury problems denied her the chance of a second Games in Tokyo last summer. “Unfortunately, [injuries have] been quite a big part of my career,” she says. “I seem to get injured at the worst times but, ultimately, it’s part of my story, it’s part of who I am, and as much as it wasn’t great and I didn’t enjoy it, it helped shape who I am today.” London 2012 was a highlight. “It’s a bit different in terms of the other major tournaments I’ve been part of; that one felt like more of a celebration of amazing talent in sport because obviously being in the village with all these incredible athletes you’re nothing in comparison,” she says. “Everyone’s just the same. That was a real surreal moment when you see Serena Williams walk in or LeBron James, all the world class sprinters like Usain Bolt and you’re like: ‘What is going on?’ That was really cool. “It was also my first experience, and so far the only experience, of true parity. The men’s team and the women’s team did everything exactly the same and I thought that was incredible and that really opened my eyes as to how things should be. It wasn’t even a matter of getting paid the same, it was a matter of these are the resources we’re going to split equally. “We stayed in the same hotel, we had the same meals, we had meal times together, shared the same training venues. We got to get to know each other … we shared experiences.” It was worthy of the tattoo of the Olympic rings on her wrist. “I remember joking with some of my friends in high school when I was 15 or 16, saying: ‘Wouldn’t it be cool if one of us went to the Olympics?’” she says. “We said it would be the only time we would get a tattoo. I ended up going to the Olympics and my friends were like: ‘Well, you better live up to that promise.’ Little things like that you never think will happen.”",Sport/Football,‘It’s part of who I am’: Bardsley not bitter after injuries force early exit,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/05/its-part-of-who-i-am-bardsley-not-bitter-after-injuries-force-early-exit
5/6/2022,"Television presenter Cathy Newman has become the latest high-profile woman to go public with her experience of having an abortion, as the possibility of the US supreme court overturning Roe v Wade sparks a defiant outpouring of testimony. Posting on Twitter on Thursday, the Channel 4 News presenter wrote that she was sad to have had an abortion but had “never for one second regretted it”. “Every woman – here, in America and the world over – needs to have that choice,” Newman said. Since Justice Samuel Alito’s draft opinion was leaked to Politico on 2 May, setting out his belief that the landmark 1973 decision guaranteeing the right to abortion had been “egregiously wrong from the start”, women have been speaking out about their own terminations. On Tuesday, the American singer-songwriter Phoebe Bridgers tweeted: “I had an abortion in October of last year while I was on tour. I went to planned parenthood, where they gave me the abortion pill. It was easy. Everyone deserves that kind of access.” In Manhattan, New York attorney general Letitia James told a crowd of protesters that for her abortion, she had “walked proudly into Planned Parenthood – and I make no apologies to anyone. To no one.” Describing herself as a woman of faith, James told the rally: “My God says that you’ve got to make the best decision for you and your life.” Writing in the Independent, Newman said Alito’s leaked decision had brought back “one of the most difficult times of [her] life”, after she and her husband were told, more than 15 years ago, that the baby she was carrying had a severe abnormality and would be unlikely to survive. While many women have chosen to emphasise their relief at being able to end their pregnancies, Newman described the experience as “devastating”. But, she said, although the decision was difficult, it was right: “There isn’t a day I regret it,” she writes. More women are now speaking up. The US podcast host Michaela Okland told her 296,000 followers on Twitter that she had an abortion aged 19, but had never felt comfortable talking about it online. “People have terrifying opinions on the topic, and even now I’m scared to speak about it,” she said. Despite the stigma, women around the world have also gone public. Under the hashtags #Myabortionstory and #ihadanabortion, Twitter users have recalled their experiences of ending a pregnancy. “I’m hoping this catches on,” wrote one. “I was in a very abusive marriage when I found out I was pregnant. I made the difficult choice to abort. I never would have left my abuser if I had had a child. I have no regrets. It should be a legal and safe option for any woman.” Ej Dickson, a Rolling Stone writer, posted: “I’ve never shared this on here, but fuck it: I’ve had an abortion. I also have one child, and I’m currently expecting another. I’ll be honest, I had incredibly complex feelings about both of these choices. But I never felt anything but deep gratitude that I *had* a choice.” A student wrote that, five months into her PhD, she had an abortion, knowing she couldn’t have maintained her academic standards and given the child she already had the same opportunities. “People rightfully give sympathy to women who choose abortion due to medical reasons,” she wrote. “That wasn’t me. I was faced with the reality of my economic class & career aspirations. If love was currency, I could have given it in excess … but that’s not the case.” The wave of testimonies is not the first provoked by shifts in the US legal landscape. Last year, when Texas passed its near-total ban on abortion, actor Uma Thurman revealed how she terminated a pregnancy when she was a teenager. Although [it was] “the hardest decision of my life”, she wrote, “choosing not to keep that early pregnancy allowed me to grow up and become the mother I wanted and needed to be.” In 2020, after the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg left a seat on the supreme court vacant for Donald Trump’s nominee, Amy Coney Barrett, Fleetwood Mac vocalist Stevie Nicks said she had an abortion in 1979. “If I had not had that abortion, I’m pretty sure there would have been no Fleetwood Mac,” she told the Guardian. “There’s just no way that I could have had a child then, working as hard as we worked constantly. And there were a lot of drugs, I was doing a lot of drugs … I would have had to walk away.” In 2019, after the state of Georgia passed its “heartbeat bill”, banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, British actor Jameela Jamil wrote on Twitter: “I had an abortion when I was young, and it was the best decision I have made. Both for me, and for the baby I didn’t want, and wasn’t ready for, emotionally, psychologically and financially. So many children will end up in foster homes. So many lives ruined. So very cruel.” The 2019 Georgia law was permanently blocked the following year by a federal judge, who found it violated the US constitution. In his ruling, Steve Jones cited precedents including Roe v Wade and a later supreme court decision, Casey v Planned Parenthood. Both those rulings, according to the document leaked this week, “must be overruled”.",News/Global development,‘I had an abortion on tour’: celebrities share abortion stories in backlash to Roe v Wade leak,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/may/05/i-had-an-abortion-on-tour-celebrities-share-abortion-stories-in-backlash-to-roe-v-wade-leak
5/6/2022,"Congratulations to Pep Guardiola, who has made the shortlist for April’s Premier League manager of the month award! The other names in the running are Brentford’s Thomas Frank, Burnley interim Mike Jackson and Jürgen Klopp of Big Cup finalists Liverp … oh Pep. Oh City. How on earth has it come to this? Overturning that two-year European ban will feel like the mother, father and extended family of pyrrhic victories right now. Ah well, at least the experience will stand City in good stead going forward. Right? Eh? And what an experience it was. City, who could easily have been 4-0 up after 20 minutes of the first leg, could easily have been 4-0 up on Wednesday night after Riyad Mahrez’s seemingly tie-settling strike was followed up by a late Jack Grealish and Joao Cancelo-inspired salvo on the Real Madrid goal. But Ferland Mendy (spectacularly) and Thibaut Courtois (twice) got in the road, and with the score on the night remaining 1-0 to City, Madrid had more than enough time left, over 84 seconds in fact, for Rodrygo to find the two goals they needed to draw level. Throw in Karim Benzema’s winning penalty after just five minutes of extra time, and City conceded three goals in just six of your officially-sanctioned Uefa minutes. It’s the latest entry in an increasingly long list of Keystone Studios-approved krazy kwickfire kontinental kollapses under Pep. City first lit the light-blue touching-cloth touchpaper in 2017, conceding twice in eight minutes in defeat by Monaco. They shipped three in 19 the following year at Anfield, two in three against Spurs a year later, and two in eight to Lyon in 2020. To be fair, they would surely have won the final last year had Antonio Rüdiger not rearranged Kevin De Bruyne’s face into a cubist masterpiece, but they were back to their usual antics on Wednesday, and the entire data set suggests City aren’t helping themselves very much here. While it’s also true that City aren’t the only team Real have knocked out with a late sucker-punch during their run to the 28 May final with Liverpool – PSG and Chelsea have also had their second-half shorts laundered, neatly pressed and handed back to them – these events were of a different dramatic stripe altogether. As the hosts cavorted around the Bernabéu with shirts proclaiming “Go for the 14”, Pep trudged off wearing a wan, thin-lipped smile, most of the colour drained from his face, a thousand-yard stare on full beam. “We need to process it and lift the players back,” he said, trying his best to move on before Sunday’s crucial Premier League visit of Newcastle.

5/6/2022,"At the heart of Jacques Demy’s delirious, gaily coloured musical Les Demoiselles de Rochefort (The Young Girls of Rochefort, 1967) is the cherubic sailor and artist Maxence, who has painted his “feminine ideal” and is now searching for the flesh and blood equivalent, hardly suspecting that she lives nearby in the form of Catherine Deneuve. With his mop of bright vanilla hair and his white bachi hat with its cherry-like pom-pom, Maxence personifies the film’s wistful, ingenuous spirit. He was played by Jacques Perrin, who has died aged 80. Perrin was already established as a bright young thing of French and Italian cinema before Demy cast him in this big-budget extravaganza alongside Gene Kelly, George Chakiris and Françoise Dorléac, Deneuve’s sister. His roles for Demy – he also played a handsome prince in the director’s fairytale musical Peau d’Âne (Donkey Skin, 1970) – remained the ones for which he was most fondly remembered, even as he insisted: “These characters were not me.” Peau d’Âne is based on Charles Perrault’s 17th-century fairytale about a princess (Deneuve) pursued romantically by her own father. In one scene, Perrin performs a series of backward rolls up a hill, a trick achieved by reversing footage of him tumbling down the hill. Once at the top, he and Deneuve snatch pastries from a banqueting table and cram them into each other’s mouths. It’s that sort of film. These performances were worlds away from the one that Perrin had given in Vittorio De Seta’s Un Uomo a Metà (Half a Man, 1966), for which he was awarded the best actor prize at the Venice film festival. In this fractured psychological drama, he was a haunted young man trying to unpick his troubled relationships with women. In later life, Perrin played two men reflecting thoughtfully on the past from the vantage point of middle-age. In the sentimental Oscar-winning hit Cinema Paradiso (1988), he was the older version of the main character, Salvatore, a Sicilian film director who as a child befriended the projectionist of his local cinema. And in Les Choristes (The Chorus, 2004), produced by Perrin and directed by his nephew Christophe Barratier, the actor fulfilled a similar function as a man looking back on his time in a boys’ choir at a boarding school in the late 1940s. Perrin also began producing films when he and the cinematographer Luciano Tovoli, who had shot Un Uomo a Metà, collaborated on a handful of documentary shorts. “I was bored to be just an actor – not being fully involved,” he said. “I wanted to be more than a mirror.” He founded the production company Reggane Films (later Galatée Films) and stepped in to help Costa-Gavras, who had directed him in Compartiment Tueurs (The Sleeping Car Murders, 1965) and Un Homme de Trop (Shock Troops, 1967), with funding for his controversial political thriller Z (1969); Perrin also played a photojournalist in the movie. “After that, I found I really liked being helpful,” he said. Other producing credits included the same director’s État de Siège (State of Siege, 1972) and Section Spéciale (1975), and Jean-Jacques Annaud’s first world war drama La Victoire en Chantant (Black and White in Colour, 1976), which was a flop on its domestic release but went on to win the Oscar for best foreign film. Perrin also produced Les Quarantièmes Rugissants (The Roaring Forties, 1982), in which he played a yachtsman based on Donald Crowhurst, who disappeared at sea in 1969. Despite the presence of Julie Christie in the cast, it was a box-office disaster that left Perrin in debt for years. International success as a producer came his way with a clutch of innovative nature documentaries. These included Microcosmos (1996), a hypnotic account of the lives of insects, which won five César awards; and the Oscar-nominated Winged Migration (2001), which followed a year in the life of migrating birds. The film employed specially made cameras and took three years to shoot on seven continents with a crew of about 450. From 300 hours of footage emerged a wondrous 90-minute film. “When you see the birds flying and you fly with them, all your worries disappear,” Perrin said. He was born in Paris, the son of Alexandre Simonet, a stage manager at the Comédie-Française theatre, and Marie Perrin, an actor whose surname Jacques borrowed once he began performing. He made his uncredited screen debut at the age of five in Marcel Carné’s Les Portes de la Nuit (Gates of the Night, 1946). After leaving school at 15, he worked in various retail jobs before finding theatre work with his sister’s godfather, the stage and film actor Antoine Balpêtré. Three years later, he enrolled at the Conservatoire National Supérieur d’Art Dramatique. It was in a production there that he was spotted by the director Valerio Zurlini, who cast him in his first lead role, as a conscientious teenager falling for a helpless woman (Claudia Cardinale) in La Ragazza con la Valigia (Girl with a Suitcase, 1961), and then as Marcello Mastroianni’s pampered brother in Cronaca Familiare (Family Portrait, 1962). He also starred in La Corruzione (Corruption, 1963) as a young man who sleeps with his father’s mistress; La 317ème Section (The 317th Platoon, 1965), one of four films he made for the director Pierre Schoendoerffer; and Claude Chabrol’s second world war thriller La Ligne de Démarcation (Line of Demarcation, 1966). After becoming popular in his more angelic roles, which also included the Italian comedy Oltraggio al Pudore (All the Other Girls Do!, 1964), Perrin worried about being pigeonholed, and began seeking out darker characters. He was a serial killer in L’Étrangleur (The Strangler, 1970), a mysterious mercenary in Schoendoerffer’s exhilarating Le Crabe-Tambour (Drummer-Crab, 1977) and a businessman conducting an affair with his colleague’s wife (Cardinale again) in La Part du Feu (Fire’s Share, 1978). He expressed the hope that such roles would “finally destroy this image which was sticking to me so tenaciously of a little adorable charmer and seducer, a nice well-scrubbed little boy … I was blond, a bit frail-looking, so they tried to give me stereotypical parts.” These psychopaths, soldiers and scoundrels, not to mention the numerous cops he played on French television, never came close to obliterating the memory of Maxence and co, though they demonstrated Perrin’s range and ambition. Among his later films were Le Pacte des Loups (Brotherhood of the Wolf, 2001) and L’Enfer (Hell, 2005), based on an unproduced script by Krzysztof Kieślowski. His final picture, Goliath (2022), was a hard-hitting drama about environmental activism and corporate malfeasance. He is survived by his wife, Valentine, whom he married in 1995, and their sons, Maxence and Lancelot, as well as by another son, Mathieu, from his first marriage, to Chantal Bouillaut, which ended in divorce in 1985.

5/6/2022,"The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued warnings to companies selling products including delta-8 THC, a cannabis compound, for making unsupported claims about the health benefits of the items. The FDA said even though there is very little research on delta-8 THC, a substance found in the cannabis sativa plant, online retailers and cafes are claiming products containing the compound will reduce anxiety or help with sleeping. Delta-8 can induce a “high” in users but is derived from a similar part of the marijuana plant to CBD, a non-psychoactive and legal compound, which makes the legality of delta-8 unclear. The FDA said several people had been hospitalized after taking delta-8 and sent warning letters to five companies – ATLRx, BioMD Plus, Delta 8 Hemp, Kingdom Harvest, and M Six Labs – for allegedly making false claims about its benefits. “The FDA is very concerned about the growing popularity of delta-8 THC products being sold online and in stores nationwide,” said Janet Woodcock, deputy commissioner of the FDA. “It is extremely troubling that some of the food products are packaged and labeled in ways that may appeal to children.” The FDA crackdown on delta-8 comes at a time when laws concerning marijuana, which is still federally banned, are in a state of flux. There is a new push in Congress, from lawmakers in both major parties, to enable cannabis firms to use banking services, which would be a significant step towards establishing their legitimacy across the US. The federal ban on cannabis forces weed dispensaries to deal in cash, which makes them a target for robberies. “This is a cash-only business right now. It’s dangerous for the employees,” Murray, a member of the Senate conference committee heading negotiations for the final version of the bill, told the Hill. “It’s dangerous for the patrons, and it can be fixed.” Groups including the American Bankers Association are lobbying lawmakers to advance a standalone bill that would provide banking services to cannabis providers, claiming it will help reduce crime and increase tax revenues. Steve Daines, a Republican senator, said he is confident that such a bill would have the required votes from both GOP and Democratic lawmakers. Last month, a bill that decriminalizes marijuana at the federal level passed the US House of Representatives. It has yet to face a vote in the Senate, however, and Joe Biden has yet to back the idea, despite vowing to support the decriminalization of weed users when campaigning for the presidency.",News/Society,Don’t believe the high: FDA issues warning over misleading legal weed claims,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/05/fda-warns-misleading-health-claims-cannabis-products
5/6/2022,"Gustav Holst composed around a dozen operas. Most of them are early works that have still never been performed, and only one of the others is heard at all regularly nowadays. But that exception, Sāvitri, is one of the gems of early 20th-century British music, and the finest product of Holst’s preoccupation with Indian culture. One of the great virtues of the one-act work is that it’s easy to present in the concert hall. No elaborate staging is required – the story, from the Sanskrit epic the Mahābhārata, of how Sāvitri outwits Death to save her husband Satyavān, is uncomplicated, and Holst presents it in an utterly economical way. The performance that formed the centrepiece of the Britten Sinfonia’s concert was prefaced by four of Holst’s Choral Hymns from the Rig Veda, and presented on the bare Barbican platform, with the wordless female chorus (the Britten Sinfonia Voices) out of sight at the back of the stage and three members of the Pagrav Dance Company, choreographed by Urja Desai Thakore, providing a delicate tracery of quiet movement around the leads. Somehow, though, in that concert hall space the emotional impact of the work was dissipated; the individual performances – Kathryn Rudge was Sāvitri, Anthony Gregory Satyavān and Ross Ramgobin Death – were all fine (though one would sometimes have liked to hear more of their words), and Mark Elder extracted real dramatic intensity from the ensemble of 12 players, but the magic that Sāvitri can generate from its graceful vocal lines and spare orchestral commentary just never happened. Elder and the Britten Sinfonia strings had begun the three-part concert with Grace Williams’s Sea Sketches – short, atmospheric pieces bundling together a range of modernist influences – and Britten’s Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge, in a performance that emphasised the work’s serious side more than its youthful exuberance. And to close the evening, the violinist Jacqueline Shave, in her last concert as the Britten Sinfonia’s leader, appeared with the tabla player Kuljit Bhamra and guitarist John Parricelli in a selection of her own pieces that seemed to cross all kind of musical boundaries: western and Indian, classical, folk and jazz. Holst, you suspect, would have approved of the fusion.",Arts/Music,Britten Sinfonia/Elder review – Holst’s Indian gem takes centre stage ,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/05/britten-sinfoniaelder-review-holsts-indian-gem-takes-centre-stage
5/6/2022,"Researchers say they have found traces of Xinjiang cotton in shirts and T-shirts made by Adidas, Puma and Hugo Boss, appearing to contradict the German clothing companies’ promises to revise their supply chains after allegations of widespread forced labour in the Chinese region. Recent reports have suggested more than half a million people from minority ethnic groups such as the Uyghurs have been coerced into picking cotton in Xinjiang, which provides more than 80% of China’s and a fifth of the global production of cotton. The US banned cotton imports from the autonomous region in north-west China last year, a move also debated in the European parliament but not enacted by the European Commission. Nonetheless, several large western clothes brands and fashion brands vowed to no longer use Xinjiang cotton in the light of the revelations. Hugo Boss said that as of October 2021 its new collections “have been verified in line with our global standards again”, and that it “does not tolerate forced labour”. Puma stated in 2020 it had “no direct or indirect business relationship with any manufacturer in Xinjiang”, while Adidas said the same year it had no contractual relationship with any Xinjiang supplier but had instructed its fabric suppliers not to source yarn from the region in the wake of reports about human rights violations. However, researchers at the Agroisolab in Jülich and the Hochschule Niederrhein University of Applied Sciences, both in western Germany, say an isotope analysis has found traces of Xinjiang cotton in Puma and Adidas T-shirts, shirts by Hugo Boss and the German outdoor wear brand Jack Wolfskin, and a pullover by the fashion company Tom Tailor. “The isotopic fingerprints in the cotton are unambiguous and can be differentiated from cotton sourced from other countries and even other Chinese regions,” Markus Boner of Agroisolab told the German public broadcaster NDR’s investigative programme STRG_F. Isotope analysis is usually used by archaeologists or forensic scientists to trace the geographic origin of organic or non-organic substances. The five German clothes brands have been contacted by the Guardian for a response to the findings, which STRG_F said it would share with the companies. Asked by STRG_F’s researchers in advance of publication whether they could rule out that Xinjiang cotton was used in their products, Adidas told the programme’s makers it exclusively sourced cotton from other countries, while Puma said: “On the basis of all of the collated information we have obtained, as well as tracing and controls we have established, we can say that our products don’t use cotton from Xinjiang.” Hugo Boss said it did not tolerate forced labour in its supply chains but would not comment further on whether it could rule out the use of Xinjiang cotton in its supply chains. Jack Wolfskin did not directly answer a question about the use of Xinjiang cotton in its supply chain but said its cotton was certified. Tom Tailor did not reply to queries from the programme. Speaking anonymously, one auditor investigating Chinese subcontractors told STRG_F it was practically impossible for western companies to thoroughly shed a light on their own supply chains as their access in China was restricted by the communist government of Xi Jinping. “It is theoretically possible but highly unlikely that western businesses can say with certainty that there is no forced labour in their cotton supply chains in Xinjiang,” the auditor said.",News/World news,"Xinjiang cotton found in Adidas, Puma and Hugo Boss tops, researchers say",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/05/xinjiang-cotton-found-adidas-puma-hugo-boss-tops-researchers-claim-uyghur
5/6/2022,"With its back-to-basics account of who he is and where he comes from, Schalk Bezuidenhout’s set might be mistaken for a debut hour. Comedy fans will know it’s not: his UK debut was at the 2019 Edinburgh fringe, when he was already a big noise in his native South Africa. Even the uninitiated, meanwhile, might justifiably doubt that any rookie could be this good. Bezuidenhout’s excuse for now serving up his backstory is that he wants to explain himself to the new fans he acquired with his Lockdown Laughs series of pandemic-era videos. And so he does, with a suite of stories from his schooldays and awkward youth. There’s nothing ostensibly remarkable about them: a tale here about his diffident participation in high-school long-distance running, an anecdote there about his dad grudgingly chaperoning him to a chess tournament. With Bezuidenhout, it’s all in the telling, as he role-plays to a T the snooty English (as opposed to Afrikaans) schoolkids defeating him at chess on a technicality, or the too-cool-for-school adolescents ferrying hookah smoke around a circle one snog at a time. These are the richest sections, where defiantly uncool Bezuidenhout, dressed like a CBeebies presenter, sends up teenage pretension – singing softly to a bonfire, say, while a friend strums a guitar. Nothing so low-key from grownup Schalk, an expressive presence on stage, and in total control of his comic register, as he identifies the one audience member to regale with his startling tale of genital puppetry, or recites – one incriminating phrase after another – a pompous motivational tweet from a fellow resident of his unglamorous home town. In a show made for South African audiences, the laughs are staggered between those who get the references immediately, and those who need a translation. No matter: Bezuidenhout’s genial manner makes that all part of the fun. More jarring is that the final 20 minutes – on the reaction of his local community to riots last summer in KwaZulu Natal, and on the 00s MTV show Pimp My Ride – bear little relation to the rest of the show. But for 40 minutes, this is a fun primer in the misfit backstory of a fast-rising talent.

5/6/2022,"Shortly after 4am on 28 March 1979, a pressure valve failed to close in the Unit 2 reactor at Three Mile Island, a nuclear power plant on a strip of land in central Pennsylvania’s Susquehanna River. The technical malfunction, compounded by human error – control room workers misread confusing signals and halted the emergency water cooling system – heated the nuclear core to dangerously high levels. The film The China Syndrome was still in theaters, starring Jane Fonda as a television reporter investigating cover-ups at a nuclear power plant whose meltdown could release radioactive material deep into the earth, “all the way to China”. Three Mile Island – still the worst commercial nuclear accident in US history – was no China Syndrome, but it got terrifyingly close to catastrophic, Chernobyl-level damage. As the Netflix docuseries Meltdown: Three Mile Island recounts, Unit 2 came less than half an hour from fully melting down – a disaster scenario that would have sickened hundreds of thousands in the surrounding area. Two days after the accident, an explosive bubble of hydrogen gas was found in the reactor. The plant’s operator, Metropolitan Edison, tried to downplay the risk of radioactive releases, but panic ensued; more than 100,000 people fled the surrounding area. Plant technicians were eventually able to slowly bleed the gas from the cooling reactor, avoiding a deadly explosion. Though workers inside the plant were exposed to dangerous levels of radiation, it remains unknown how much contamination escaped the facility into the surrounding community. That is the story of Three Mile Island that most Americans will find in the history textbooks, if they have heard of the accident at all. The first two of Meltdown’s four 45-minute episodes focus on this chilling near-miss, as well as the obfuscation and confusion that greatly eroded public trust in nuclear power. But the story of Three Mile Island did not end with the five-day red-alert saga – not for the workers tasked with safely cleaning up the molten reactor, nor for the surrounding community, disillusioned and furious. In its second half, Meltdown, directed by Kief Davidson, homes in on the story of Rick Parks, a cleanup supervisor turned whistleblower on the Bechtel Corp, the company hired to conduct the billion-dollar cleanup by Metropolitan Edison and supervised by the government’s Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). “While a lot of people know about the disaster, they don’t know about what happened in the cleanup phase and how close we were to another disaster,” Davidson told the Guardian. “We dodged a bullet a second time, and it was entirely due to the fact that Rick Parks and [fellow whistleblower] Larry King stood up. “We should know about these stories,” he added. “We should be able to look at the people who risk everything in order to save communities from a potential disaster.” Parks, a Missouri native and navy-trained nuclear operator who provides colorful, refreshingly straight-shooting narration throughout the series, moved to Middletown, Pennsylvania – the town directly adjacent to Three Mile Island – to work on cleanup three years after the accident. At the time, Bechtel was the largest private construction company in the world, with numerous Reagan administration officials on its board. The cleanup was risky, arduous and behind schedule. Bechtel received funds upon completion of individual tasks, incentivizing the company and its hirer, General Public Utilities (GPU), to cut corners and ignore NRC regulations. Parks was particularly alarmed by rushed, off-books repairs to a polar crane damaged by radioactivity. The crane was supposed to lift the head off the reactor to expose the core; according to Park and the series, if the faulty crane malfunctioned and dropped its load on to the core, the resulting damage could have caused a radioactive leak on par with the China Syndrome. When Parks and two other employees, King and Ed Gishel, took their concerns to higher-ups at GPU and the NRC, they were dismissed. Gishel was recommended for a psychological evaluation. Parks found marijuana placed in his car on the day of a random drug inspection; someone later broke into his apartment and searched his files. (The NRC’s on-site coordinator, Lake Bennett, participates in the series and claims to not remember meeting Parks. He later say whatever Parks told him did not merit concern – “I was satisfied that that crane was safe enough.”) Gravely concerned for the safety of family, Middletown and a potentially statewide disaster zone, Parks took his records to the Government Accountability Project, then went public days before a vote would certify the crane’s use. His disclosures and mounting public pressure caused the NRC to halt and then overhaul the cleanup process at Three Mile Island. Carla Shamberg, Meltdown’s executive producer, first heard of Parks through lawyers for the Government Accountability Project, some of whom appear in the series, while executive-producing another project: the 2000 film Erin Brockovich, starring Julia Roberts as a real-life whistleblower. It’s taken nearly 20 years since for some version of it to make it to air. Parks and other whistleblowers were “superheroes”, she told the Guardian. “They’re one of the last bastions of the truth.” “I think they should have capes,” she said. “They’re just amazing. They protect people they’ve never met and they protect thousands, if not millions, of people. It’s the bravest thing I’ve ever seen anybody do.” Parks’s story has a relatively happy ending – the series delves into the personal and emotional costs of his disclosures, but the damaged crane was not used. In 1983, the same year he came forward, Metropolitan Edison was indicted on criminal charges of falsifying safety reports before the accident; the company’s plea bargain included a $45,000 fine and $1m pledge to help emergency planning in the surrounding area. Still, in the four decades since, “it hasn’t gotten better for whistleblowers,” said Davidson. “To go public now is a lot different than it was even 10 years ago. It’s a lot harder now. Whistleblowers aren’t always rewarded for their actions.” To this day, the official government record is that radiation released at Three Mile Island never reached levels dangerous to humans; the official death toll is zero. But local residents turned activists, several of whom appear in the series, say otherwise. The film cites a 1997 study by epidemiologist Steven Wing, which found cancer rates two to three times the average in areas downwind of the facility. In 2017, researchers at Penn State College of Medicine found that a certain type of thyroid cancer was common in people who had been near the plant after the accident. Several subjects in the series – including Parks and his ex-stepdaughter Nicole, who was six years old at the time of the disaster – have survived bouts of cancer or lost loved ones to it. No one can be sure it’s related to radiation – Parks, who had throat cancer, was also a smoker, “so there’s always that but, and that’s why the NRC gets away with everything,” he says. But the anecdotes point to more than a coincidence. Still, “the project isn’t about how is the cancer, who got cancer, how many people got it,” said Davidson. Instead, the series argues for “holding industry and large corporations accountable for their actions. “We’re not coming into this story from a pro-nuclear standpoint,” said Davidson. “There’s pros and cons and arguments to both sides, and a lot of the characters that we’ve interviewed for this, like Rick Parks, really believe that to solve our energy crisis nuclear has to be in the mix. “But there’s consequences that have to be looked at. And when things go wrong, it can go wrong in a pretty horrible way,” he added. Or, as Parks says in the final episode: “We’ll never have a viable nuclear industry in this country until we take the profit motive out of it.”",Arts/Television & radio,‘Dodged a bullet’: how whistleblowers averted a second US nuclear disaster,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/05/meltdown-three-mile-island-netflix-us-nuclear-accident
5/6/2022,"Hello, and Happy Thursday, I’m writing from Atlanta, where I’m spending this week reporting on the Republican primary for secretary of state. This race is perhaps the most important primary happening in America this year. Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s incumbent secretary of state, is in a really tough re-election battle after memorably standing up to Donald Trump in 2020 and refusing his request to “find 11,780 votes” to overturn the election 2020 results. The former president is backing Jody Hice, a conservative congressman who has embraced the myth the election was stolen in a bid to oust Raffensperger. It’s the first major test we’re seeing this year of whether a Republican who defends democracy can withstand the wrath of his own party. It’s also a major test for democracy both in Georgia and the US – one of several closely watched races this year in which candidates who have expressed willingness to overturn an election are seeking to be the chief election officials in their state. I spent Monday morning in a conference room at the headquarters of Georgia Public Broadcasting, watching a live stream of Raffensperger, Hice and two other candidates – David Belle Isle and TJ Hudson – debate downstairs (reporters were not allowed in the room). Nearly the entire hour was about the 2020 election, with the other three candidates repeating baseless and debunked claims of fraud. The first question Hice was asked was why voters should trust his judgment if he continues to believe the election was stolen. He dodged. “The big lie in all of this is that there were no problems in this last election. This last election was filled with problems,” Hice said. “Election security must be protected and Brad Raffensperger let that ball majorly fall.” Afterwards, I asked Hice something I’ve been asking almost everyone I meet who believes the 2020 election was stolen: is there anything he could see that could convince him that it was accurate. The election results in Georgia have been confirmed through multiple audits and recounts. “Not at this point, there’s nothing,” he said, going on to reference an allegation of illegal ballot harvesting from a conservative group that Raffensperger’s office is currently investigating. “This election was just overwhelmed with fraudulent activity. There’s nothing that can change my opinion of that.” I also asked Hice if he thought Trump’s call to Raffensperger was appropriate. If he was elected, what would he do if a president from his own party called him up and asked him to find votes for him? “Absolutely, there was nothing wrong with that request,” Hice said. “He was not saying go out and ‘find illegal ballots for me’. He was saying look at all the fraud that’s out here. Do your job. Make sure we have legal ballots that are cast, legal ballots that are counted, and had Brad done so, I believe the outcome would have been different.” But the January 2021 call from Trump to Raffensperger was not just a generalized call to investigate suspicious activity. As Trump and his team listed what they saw as irregularities, Raffensperger and his staff said that they were either investigating them or had debunked them. Trump made it clear that he wanted the outcome to be a reversal of the election results. “All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state,” he said. During the debate, Raffensperger pushed back on Hice by repeatedly describing him as a liar while also trying to burnish his own conservative credentials. He repeatedly touted his focus on preventing non-citizen voting – which is virtually non-existent. He said he would be in favor of getting rid of a federal prohibition on giant voter removals within 90 days of an election. And he said he supported getting rid of no-excuse mail-in voting in Georgia. In any other race, all of those would be controversial positions on their own. During the debate on Monday, they seemed moderate in comparison with those of Hice, who refuses to acknowledge the legitimacy of the 2020 election. At one point during the debate, Raffensperger, a former engineer who is soft-spoken and sometimes speaks awkwardly, seemed exasperated. He detailed how his office had played a kind of Whac-A-Mole after the 2020 election, debunking claims about felon voting, underage voting and dead people voting. “The real problem that you have gets down to basic honesty,” he said. “It gets down to, it was actual, total, disinformation, misinformation, outright lying. And there’s not much I can do about that, because Jody Hice has been running from one rumor to another for the last 18 months. And how can you have confidence when people that should be holding a responsible position as a sitting congressman should be telling the truth.” Georgia’s department of driver services quietly eliminated automatic voter registration on its website, but has since restored it. A decision striking down New York’s congressional map is a major blow to Democratic efforts to keep control of the US House this year Mississippi’s governor vetoed a bill that would make it moderately easier for people with felony convictions to get their voting rights back.",News/US news,Georgia sees first major test for a Republican defending democracy | The fight to vote,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/05/georgia-secretary-state-primary-raffensperger-hice
