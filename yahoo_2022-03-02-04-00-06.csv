Some Russian troops have been surrendering to Ukrainian forces ""without a fight"" as morale drops amid Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, a US senior defense official told reporters in a briefing on Tuesday. The US official said that there has been evidence ""of a certain risk averse behavior by the Russian military,"" in the last six days since Russia launched its attack on the eastern European country, CNN reported. ""You've seen it on the ground, where units are surrendering, sometimes without a fight,"" the official said, according to the news outlet. The official said that many among Russia's military are young draftees who have never faced combat. ""And they've got, a lot of these soldiers are conscripts, never been in combat before, some of whom we believe weren't even told they were going to be in combat,"" the US official said, according to CNN. ""So we're just seeing evidence of a bit of risk aversion."" Russia's troops are also struggling with ""fuel and sustainment"" issues, the official said, adding that Russian forces have given indications that they are running out of food, CNN reported. However, the official said that Russian troops' slowing advance on Ukraine may be for ""regrouping, rethinking, reevaluating"" purposes, CNN reported.

3/2/2022,"European stocks tumbled into the red on Tuesday as geopolitical tensions between Russia, Ukraine and the west continued to weigh on investors. In London, the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) was 1.7% lower by the end of the day, while the CAC (^FCHI) lost 3.2% in Paris, and the Frankfurt DAX (^GDAXI) was 3.1% lower. It came as China signalled it was ready to play a role in finding a ceasefire in Ukraine. Beijing said it was “extremely concerned about the harm to civilians” after a phone call between Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi and his Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba. “Ukraine is willing to strengthen communications with China and looks forward to China playing a role in realising a ceasefire,” the Chinese statement said on Tuesday. Meanwhile, French finance minister Bruno Le Maire warned Moscow in a broadcast: ""We will bring about the collapse of the Russian economy. ""The economic and financial balance of power is totally in favour of the European Union which is in the process of discovering its own economic power. We are waging total economic and financial war on Russia."" In response, Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president, wrote on Twitter: ""Today, some French minister has said that they declared an economic war on Russia. ""Watch your tongue, gentlemen! And don’t forget that in human history, economic wars quite often turned into real ones."" Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""This is a fast-moving situation and investors should be mindful of potential share price volatility in the short to medium term."" Meanwhile, Mastercard (MA) and Visa (V) have blocked multiple financial institutions from their payment networks after the west rolled out tough new sanctions against Russia. Recent sanctions have caused a spike in cryptocurrencies, particularly in Russia and Ukraine. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) trading in the Russian rouble went into overdrive when the invasion began last Thursday with daily volumes rising around 260% from a day earlier to 1.3bn rouble (£9.2m, $13.5m), according to data from CryptoCompare. “The direct implication of Russian sanctions was a surge in cryptocurrency prices, and especially bitcoin,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote.

It may also help Russian companies and even the Russian central bank to move funds as these entities can no longer access US dollars, and most of the Russian banks are no longer part of the SWIFT system.” Ukraine has also been asking for donations in cryptocurrency to help fund its defence. Russian citizens scramble to withdraw cash as the U.S. Treasury targets Russia’s central bank. Max Sneddon, Moscow Bureau Chief at the Financial Times, talks about the impact of sanctions. The Russian rouble regained some footing after it plunged 30% to a record low of 120 per dollar on Monday, while the safe-haven dollar resumed its rise against other major currencies. The Russian central bank more than doubled its key interest rate to 20%, and also announced a slew of other measures to stem the decline.

The Dow Jones (^DJI) also edged 1.7% lower as banking stocks declined further. It comes as the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq have halted trading of shares in Russia-based companies listed on their exchanges. The halts were due to regulatory concerns as the exchanges seek more information following economic sanctions imposed on Russia, Reuters reports.

3/2/2022,"The Felicity Ace, the cargo ship that caught fire while carrying thousands of brand new Volkswagen, Porsche, and Lamborghini vehicles, sunk Tuesday morning, according to a press statement. The ship, which was carrying around 4000 cars, sank after it ""suffered a list to starboard,"" a press release from its operators said Tuesday. The Felicity Ace became submerged around 253 miles away from the Portuguese archipelago of Azores around 9 a.m. local time on Tuesday. A spokesperson for the Felicity Ace told Road & Track the information comes from a local ship salvage team. Bloomberg reports that the ship and its salvage crews were fighting harsh seas before it sunk. “The weather was pretty rough out there,” Pat Adamson, a spokesperson for the Felicity Ace's operator, MOL Ship Management, said to Bloomberg. “And then she sank, which was a surprise.” Before Tuesday, the last update from the vessel's owners, Japan-based Mitsui O.S.K. Lines transportation company (MOL), came on February 25, saying the boat was stable and had been boarded by salvage crews. The company said it was using a salvage vessel to move the Felicity Ace to a safe area off Azores. The troubles began on February 16, when the vessel caught fire while en route from Emden, Germany to Davisville, Rhode Island. The fire continued for several days, finally dying down on February 25, according to MOL. All crew were evacuated without injury, and the ship was abandoned. The Felicity Ace's fire was reportedly complicated by a number of electric cars onboard, with batteries that caught fire. It's still unclear what initially caused the blaze.
