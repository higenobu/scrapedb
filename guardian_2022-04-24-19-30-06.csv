4/24/2022,"Driving an electric car for a year costs almost £600 less than its petrol equivalent after fuel prices surged more than electricity costs, research by comparison website Compare the Market has found. Electric vehicles were already cheaper to run, according to figures shared with the Guardian, but the gap has widened significantly amid turmoil in global energy markets caused by the war in Ukraine. The average annual cost of driving an electric vehicle is now £1,264, Compare the Market found, compared with £1,834 for a petrol car. Running either kind of vehicle is markedly more expensive than a year ago. Petrol prices hit record highs in March and have only dropped slightly this month, while the new price cap on domestic energy bills, which came in on 1 April, has brought with it higher electricity costs. But petrol cars registered the biggest cost increase, up by more than £300 from £1,530, while electric car ownership is £137 more expensive than in 2021. The change means the cost advantage of an electric car has widened from £403 to £570. The figures take into account average costs for insurance, MOT and fuel, as well as vehicle excise duty of £165 for a petrol car, a tax from which electric cars are exempt. The research was based on a driver travelling 6,700 miles a year and paying £1.62 a litre for petrol or 28p a kWh for electricity. Alex Hasty, director at Compare the Market, said: “Despite surging energy bills, motorists who’ve made the switch will be glad to see that electric vehicles cost substantially less to run than a petrol alternative. “As well as helping the environment, these drivers benefit from savings in fuel, insurance, and tax.” Rising petrol and diesel prices are making electric cars an attractive option for many motorists, and sales have been booming. Industry figures show that in March British drivers bought more of them than in the whole of 2019. However, they are not an option for everyone. Hasty said: “There is a significant upfront cost of buying an electric car and installing a home charging point which will prevent many drivers from being able to afford this option.”",News/Business,Electric car cost advantage over petrol grows amid energy market turmoil,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/24/electric-car-cost-advantage-petrol-grows-energy-market-turmoil-ukraine
4/24/2022,"Angela Rayner has said she will not be deterred by “vile lies” after a widely criticised report suggested Conservative MPs believe she crosses and uncrosses her legs during prime minister’s questions to distract Boris Johnson. The Mail on Sunday reported that unnamed senior Tories had “mischievously” suggested Labour’s deputy leader deploys what it called “a fully clothed parliamentary equivalent of Sharon Stone’s infamous scene in the 1992 film Basic Instinct”. The article quoted a Conservative MP saying: “She knows she can’t compete with Boris’s Oxford Union debating training, but she has other skills which he lacks. She has admitted as much when enjoying drinks with us on the [Commons] terrace.” It also contrasted Rayner’s background, as a former care worker who left school at 16, with that of the Old Etonian prime minister. In a series of furious tweets on Sunday morning, Rayner hit back against the anonymous briefing, saying she was a victim of “sexism and misogyny”. “I stand accused of a ‘ploy’ to ‘distract’ the helpless PM – by being a woman, having legs and wearing clothes,” Rayner said. She accused Johnson’s allies of “resorting to spreading desperate, perverted smears in their doomed attempts to save his skin”. “He and his cheerleaders clearly have a big problem with women in public life. They should be ashamed of themselves. I won’t be letting their vile lies deter me. Their attempts to harass and intimidate me will fail,” she said. Johnson tweeted on Sunday: “As much as I disagree with Angela Rayner on almost every political issue I respect her as a parliamentarian and deplore the misogyny directed at her anonymously today.” The Conservative party chair, Oliver Dowden, also rejected the claims, describing them as “totally ludicrous”. “I like the Mail on Sunday and I enjoy reading it but I think it’s a totally ludicrous story that I don’t recognise,” he said. The former leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom agreed, criticising the “totally unacceptable comments and reporting”. Rayner last confronted Johnson at prime minister’s questions in January, when Keir Starmer was self-isolating with Covid. She challenged the prime minister over the cost of living crisis, pointing to his previous relaxed stance about inflation and asking: “How did he get it so wrong?” Rayner sparked controversy at last autumn’s Labour conference for describing the Conservatives during a party event as “homophobic, racist, misogynistic … scum”. In Basic Instinct, Stone plays a violent psychopathic killer, who in a notorious scene briefly flashes her vulva while being interrogated by a police detective played by Michael Douglas.",News/Politics,Angela Rayner hits back at claims of ‘Basic Instinct’ tactics to distract PM,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/24/angela-rayner-hits-back-at-claims-of-basic-instinct-tactics-to-distract-pm
4/24/2022,"In Washington it was the week of the four Ws – war, walkouts, weakness and warnings. Some half yearly get-togethers of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank are dull, easily forgettable affairs; this was not one of them. The first W – the war in Ukraine – dominated the meetings and could well dominate the next gathering of the two institutions in the autumn as well. Despite pleas for the fighting to stop, there is no sign of that happening. This will have dire consequences for Ukraine, Europe’s poorest country even before the Russian invasion. The World Bank estimates the cost in ruined buildings and infrastructure alone runs to $60bn (£46.7bn). The IMF says the economy could contract by almost 40% this year and that Kyiv will need external support of $5bn a month simply to keep the country operating. Russia will also suffer severe damage as a result of its aggression, but the impact of the war is not confined to the two protagonists. It is leading to dearer energy and food, while the resulting higher inflation and slower global growth mean there is both a humanitarian and an economic rationale for bringing the war to an end. Hence the second W: the symbolic walkout by the British, Americans and Canadians when the Russian representatives started to speak at the meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors. Russia retaliated by blocking the release of a communique at the end of the meeting of the IMF’s main policy committee, which traditionally requires unanimity. These diplomatic manoeuvres highlighted weaknesses in the multilateral system: the third W. The G20 came to prominence during the global financial crisis and was supposed to supersede the G7 as the prime international forum for economic policy makers. This made sense. The G7 represented only the bigger developed countries while the G20 included a broader group of strategically important nations such as China, India, Brazil, Saudi Arabia – and Russia. The G20 made a good start at the London summit of 2009 but has subsequently failed on its promise. It has become a talking shop where countries discuss the pressing problems of the day – the need to make vaccines widely available or the lack of an effective mechanism for delivering debt relief – but then fail to come up with the required solutions. There is plenty of grandstanding but little common purpose, as was demonstrated last week. By no means all G20 members are willing publicly to express displeasure at what Russia is doing in Ukraine. This brings us to the fourth and final W: the air in Washington last week was thick with warnings. The IMF warned that recovery from the pandemic would be a lot slower than expected and that central banks would find it harder to calibrate the right level for interest rates. The World Bank warned that people would go hungry as a result of higher food prices, perhaps resulting in social unrest. Both the IMF and the World Bank warned of rising debt distress. The outlook is poor for developed countries like Britain, where cost of living pressures are already starting to weigh on confidence and spending. The prospects are, though, even worse for poorer parts of the world at a time when some central banks – including the US federal reserve – are becoming increasingly hawkish. Krishna Guha, analyst at the investment bank Evercore, says: “The larger takeaway from the IMF and World Bank meetings […] is the acute vulnerability of non-commodity exporting emerging market countries to a perfect storm of an unfinished pandemic recovery with high debt, the war shock to energy and food prices, China lockdown growth risk, and Fed tightening.” That is a reasonable summary and echoes warnings from the UN that weaker global demand, insufficient policy coordination at the international level and rising debt levels from the pandemic will generate financial shockwaves that will push some developing countries into a downward spiral of insolvency, recession and arrested development. Achim Steiner, administrator of the UN Development Programme, says he is “extremely concerned” at the scale of the crisis and the speed at which it is unfolding. “We are ill-prepared to deal with this. As a result of the pandemic, many poor countries have no fiscal space left and have their backs to the wall”. Almost 70 countries, he adds, are facing the “perfect storm” of rising energy costs, rising food prices and heavier debt-servicing costs. A fifth W was notable by its absence in Washington last week, and that’s winning. The IMF took some comfort from the $40bn of pledges made to its Resilience and Sustainability Trust – designed to help poor countries tackle the climate crisis and other structural challenges – but Ukraine alone is going to need more than that. Every finance minister and central bank governor knows that the war is a catastrophe for the global economy and the costs will mount the longer it goes on. It’s easy to see what defeat looks like: stagflation and falling living standards in the developed parts of the world; hunger, food riots and debt defaults in the poorer parts. It is harder to see what victory looks like, other than a pyrrhic one. An immediate ceasefire and Russian withdrawal would lead to lower energy and food prices, reduce inflation and make it easier for central banks to limit the extent of interest rate rises. A prolonged war of attrition is a more likely scenario, and that will lead eventually to weaker demand, a collapse in energy prices and much lower inflation rates. For now though, the best that the IMF and the World Bank can offer is damage limitation. The outlook is grim and getting grimmer.",News/Business,World Bank and IMF gathering underscores a bleak global outlook | Larry Elliot,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/24/world-bank-and-imf-gathering-underscores-a-bleak-global-outlook
4/24/2022,"A rare 16th-century book offers “compelling evidence” that William Shakespeare’s Cymbeline was inspired by a now-lost play by Sir Thomas North, an Elizabethan courtier and writer, new research claims. A 1533 edition of Fabyan’s Chronicle, a compendium of British and French history from Roman times to Henry VII, bears notes in the margin in North’s hand that has been linked to the plot and other details of Shakespeare’s tragicomedy, set in Roman Britain. Michael Blanding, who unearthed the book in Harvard University’s Houghton Library, said the marginalia could not have been based on Shakespeare’s play because North died about six years before the conventionally accepted date of its first performance, 1609-10. “It is a revolutionary discovery that is hard to interpret in any other way than that North used the book to write notes for his own play, which Shakespeare later adapted,” he said. The marginalia has been analysed by an independent researcher, Dennis McCarthy, who since 2005 has used plagiarism software to reveal links between Hamlet, among other plays, and North’s writings. His research inspired Blanding’s book North by Shakespeare, published by Hachette last year and to be released shortly as a paperback, retitled In Shakespeare’s Shadow. Since then, Blanding has tracked down dozens of 16th-century books once owned by the North family. Several bear North’s marginalia. Blanding said that, while North is known as the translator of Plutarch’s Lives, a recognised source for Shakespeare’s Roman plays, the marginalia in Fabyan’s Chronicle “often provides a point-by-point correspondence with the historical plot of Cymbeline”. “For example, both the marginalia and the play refer to Julius Caesar’s repeated attempts to invade Britain, and display an obsessive focus on the theme of tributes being paid to Rome by British kings,” Blanding said. “In addition, both focus on Cymbeline’s sons, Guiderius and Arviragus, include a strategy of a character disguising himself to kill an enemy, and incorporate a battle by a ‘wall of turfs’, historically fought in Scotland.” Cymbeline, one of Shakespeare’s later plays, is about an ancient king of Britain. It revolves around a bet about the faithfulness of his daughter, Innogen, to the man she marries in secret, Posthumus Leonatus, and builds into a confrontation between the Britons and the Roman army. The character of Cymbeline is based on a Celtic king referred to by contemporary historians and an important figure in later histories of Britain by writers such as Geoffrey of Monmouth. McCarthy, whose research has involved June Schlueter, professor emerita at Lafayette College, Pennsylvania, said: “I think [North] was writing it as an outline for a play … collecting historical instances that he would use. They are all based on the same theme … Britain versus Rome.” He pointed to documentary evidence that connects North to the theatre troupe of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, with a payment to North for a Leicester’s Men play at court. Although McCarthy is not a Shakespeare denier, and he acknowledges that scholars have credited Fabyan’s Chronicle as a source, he said that North’s marginalia “strongly suggest that the creative genius behind Cymbeline was, in fact, Thomas North”. In a study of the marginalia, to be published today, he writes that these copious notes relate to the background, characters and language of Shakespeare’s play: “Of North’s 53 distinct marginal comments, more than half relate to characters and events referenced in Shakespeare’s play – and nearly all the others have thematic or substantive relevance.” He points to details such as the misspelling of Cassibellan as Cassibulan: “In the 1623 First Folio of Shakespeare’s Cymbeline, the play’s first known publication, the Queen refers to an earlier British king who fought the Romans as ‘Cassibulan’. The playwright’s Cassibulan is a misspelling of Cassibellan … There is no known historical text prior to the First Folio that also uses that spelling … It is clear from North’s annotation that he is responsible … for the misspelling of the name.” McCarthy said that some scholars are unsettled by such discoveries: “With discovery after discovery, this is becoming very difficult to ignore … We have incontrovertible proof.” But Michael Dobson, director of the Shakespeare Institute, Stratford-upon-Avon, said that while the discovery of North’s annotations was “significant” in its own right, “I don’t think the evidence … comes anywhere near substantiating the claim that North was using Fabyan’s Chronicle as the basis for a play about Cymbeline. “Nor does there seem to be any reason for thinking that Shakespeare would have needed to know about these annotations, or the otherwise completely undocumented and unknown play which North is here alleged to have composed out of them.” He added that spelling evidence in the First Folio was “never strong” because it recorded the spelling of those who transcribed playhouse documents rather than that of Shakespeare. The main plot of Cymbeline came from Boccaccio’s Decameron, rather than Fabyan or other chroniclers, he said. Richard Dutton, author of the forthcoming book Mastering the Revels: The Regulation and Censorship of Early Modern Drama, said: “The discovery of Thomas North’s marginalia relating to the subject matter of Cymbeline is intriguing and I would not rule out the possibility that Shakespeare was somehow familiar with it. But the argument that he knew about it from an unknown play that North himself wrote … is implausible.”",Arts/Culture,New evidence suggests Shakespeare may have stolen the plot of Cymbeline,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/24/new-evidence-shakespeare-stole-plot-of-cymbeline-
4/24/2022,"When the lockdown shockwave ran through Britain’s food supply chains, fruit growers were among the worst affected. With Wimbledon and weddings cancelled, strawberries, raspberries and mountains of other seasonal fruit were at risk of being thrown away. But the pandemic provided an unexpected silver lining for enterprising distillers who diverted the surplus into a slew of new spirits that are helping to cut down on food waste. “This is a growing trend,” says James Oag-Cooper, managing director of Hyke Gin, which is made from discarded supermarket “table” grapes grown to be eaten fresh. “The space has changed dramatically in the last five years as consumers’ appetite for more sustainable ingredients, even pre-lockdown, has soared,” he said. The newest kid on the block is from Sorted Food – the social media movement dedicated to cooking – which has partnered with North Yorkshire’s Sloemotion Distillery to launch a strawberry gin liqueur that goes on sale in May. The tipple uses the excess strawberry crop grown in Yorkshire. Hyke Gin is also using orange skins left over from supermarket fruit salads in its orange gin, while discarded cherries, spent coffee grounds and coconut all go into its Mad City Botanical Rum along with molasses; a natural byproduct made from processing sugar cane. Beer drinkers also have a growing range of options with which to slake their thirst. Toast Ale, brewer of the first UK-produced beer made from leftover bread, has linked up with fruit and veg box scheme Oddbox and drinks company Flawsome to produce a Mango IPA made from “wonky” mangoes, while a low-alcohol Raspberry Sour uses berries sourced from condiment maker and food waste warriors Rubies in the Rubble. Last year the Sipsmith brand stepped in to help reduce the fruit glut by producing a limited edition strawberry gin – a London Dry gin distilled with the 2020 strawberry harvest from Kent-based Hugh Lowe Farms, exclusive berry grower for the Wimbledon fortnight. Nick Marston, chair of British Summer Fruits, said: “I’m sure it was helpful to the individual grower and shows a nice alternative use for berries. There’s always some fruit waste and the spirit producers used a limited tonnage – around 80,000 tonnes of UK strawberries.” When the first lockdown began in March 2020, food producers and wholesalers struggled to deal with tens of thousands of tonnes of perishable fruit and vegetables no longer required by restaurants, hotels and schools. The UK strawberry crop was particularly badly hit because of the cancellation of the Wimbledon tennis tournament, weddings and all other large outdoor events and gatherings. Each year more than 38.4 tonnes of strawberries (1.92 million strawberries) and 445kg of raspberries are picked and consumed at Wimbledon; the equivalent of more than 140,000 punnets. The food redistribution charity FareShare reports that in 2020-21 it received 3,679 tonnes of surplus fresh fruit – eight times as much as the 454.4 tonnes the year before.",Lifestyle/Food,Distillers lift UK growers’ spirits with summer fruit tipples ,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/24/distillers-lift-growers-spirits-with-summer-fruit-tipples
4/24/2022,"The actor Sam Beckinsale, 55, is perhaps best known for her role as firefighter Kate Stevens in ITV’s long-running series London’s Burning, watched by more than 15 million people. After leaving in 1992, she had roles in numerous television series and stage plays before stepping away from her career. Throughout May, her face will again become familiar to the public as one of a dozen participants in a remarkable project called I Am in Manchester. I Am is the work of Allie Crewe an acclaimed, award-winning photographer. It grew out of the year she spent as artist in residence at SafeLives, a domestic abuse charity. Beckinsale’s portrait is one of a dozen large-scale photographs taken by Crewe of women and men who have experienced or witnessed family or intimate partner violence (IPV). They will be displayed at 150 Metrolink stops across Manchester and in the city’s St Peter’s Square as part of the SICK! festival, which examines mental and physical health through the arts. The portraits convey a mix of fortitude, resilience, vulnerability and strength. A further 33 are displayed online, along with anonymised stories of the participants’ experiences of domestic abuse. This includes sexual, physical, economic, emotional and coercively controlling behaviour. For many of those portrayed, including Beckinsale, this is the first time they have both broken a taboo of silence and shown their faces, as survivors, to the world. Why take the risk? “I was lucky enough to have an amazing job and I was mentally and physically healthy,” Beckinsale says. She had discovered at the age of 11 that the actor Richard Beckinsale, star of the TV series Porridge, who died aged 31 in 1979, was her biological father. Her half sister is the actor Kate Beckinsale. “I had been working since I was 15. I bought my first flat at 24. My nickname on London’s Burning was ‘Freehold’ because I bought property, did it up and sold it as an alternative income stream. I had been brought up to be fiercely independent by my mother, who had been a single parent. That’s who I was.” Then for several years Beckinsale says she was in a coercively controlling relationship. The pattern and the rapid erosion of her sense of self, from “day one”, she now recognises because it is so similar to relationships recounted by others in her domestic abuse support group. “It begins with love-bombing and then it quickly progresses to the point where you find yourself itemising everything that you buy in the supermarket. You are told: ‘If you loved me, you wouldn’t be taking that job or seeing those friends.’ “I didn’t have to be hit, I was so well trained. You are destroyed on every level,” she says. “They push a wholly false narrative to the point that you don’t know which way is up. You may still be walking and talking, but the person you were has been annihilated. “I’ve been homeless. I have no pension; I’m not mortgageable any more. Security has gone. I’ve lost the skills as an actress I need to keep oiling, and I want to work. I’m not where I could have been but I’m lucky – I’m alive,” she adds. “Many don’t get the chance to begin again. “Even when the cage door is open it’s difficult to step out, but I’m stepping out now by doing this project. Whether there will be a backlash, what the outcome might be, I have no idea. I do feel vulnerable but knowing what I now know about coercive control, if I don’t speak up, my silence is complicit. “I’m hoping that, through the project, women who believe whatever’s happening to them is all their own fault might think again. They might look at me, and say: ‘If it can happen to her, it can happen to anyone. It is happening to me and it’s real.’” In 2020, IPV affected 2.3 million people in England and Wales – 1.6 million of them female. Three out of four cases of IPV reported to the police result in no further action. Coercive control that leaves no bruises but is part of a process of isolation, mental destabilisation and the dismantling of a partner’s freedom has been an offence since 2015. According to research by the College of Policing, the conviction rate, again, is minuscule. Beckinsale, along with Chief Inspector Sharon Baker and Crewe, also a survivor of sexual and physical abuse, chose to speak to the Observer to explain why it matters that they are seen and their stories heard. In 2020, Baker, 43, now professional standards and domestic abuse lead at Avon and Somerset Police, acting without consulting her superiors, made a six-minute video that revealed the five years of coercive control she had experienced a decade before. It was intended for internal police consumption only. When she told her boss what she had done, the initial response was: “Bloody hell! You can’t do that!” As a result of the video and the attached survey, to Baker’s surprise 138 officers in her force contacted her to say that they too had experienced domestic abuse. That video is now on YouTube, and Baker’s portrait will be displayed in Manchester. “Six months before I made the video, one of my team had been walking home when she was assaulted by her partner. Police were driving past, saw him battering her and arrested him. I visited her and I was shocked at how she blamed herself. I said: ‘God no, love, no. It’s not you, it’s him. It’s happened to me too.’ We both cried. Later she said it really helped her to think differently about herself.” Baker explains why she decided to go public with her own experiences. “I hadn’t spoken out before because I didn’t think society or the force were ready to hear that a chief inspector could be a victim. There would have been organisational awkwardness around it. I felt my colleagues would say my job was to keep the public and my staff safe. What would they think if I couldn’t keep myself safe? I felt overwhelming shame and embarrassment.” When Baker told her partner that the relationship was over, there was an altercation and the police were called. “By the time they arrived, I was a hysterical gibbering wreck while he had dressed and was sitting calmly at the table. I thought: ‘No one’s going to believe me’ – but I was believed.” A growing group in the force now meet online monthly, committed to accelerating change. The I Am project is the next part of the process. “Those who protect others in senior positions may find it particularly difficult to speak out because they are perceived as strong,” Baker says. She hopes that the photograph of her in uniform, 22 years in the force, on the Manchester metro may help to break that barrier. After the video, she was made domestic abuse lead. She says: “I know the police haven’t got it right. I get that. But I feel now is the moment. “We’ve realised since the video that our culture in policing wasn’t right for our own staff in our force, so how could we get that right for the public? We are creating a hostile environment internally for perpetrators. If they are scared, they need to be. It’s not good enough for the public and it’s not good enough for you to be part of my team.” She is married now. “Once you have a healthy relationship, you know what it should be like. When you’ve been at the other end, you feel such gratitude on a daily basis.” Crewe, 54, sees her work as political, feminist, driven by social injustice and the power of transformation. “The men and women in these portraits ask us to confront their gaze, to pay attention to their trauma … A face opens the conversation. We challenge the values of a society that tolerates violence and turns a blind eye.” Crewe says she was raised in a family in which she was sexually abused by her grandparents and physically abused by her parents. “I was born in 1967. Then, there was no line between a smack on the legs, called discipline, and finding yourself lying on the floor with broken bones. I learned when I was about eight years old that other children were different. You keep the secret of abuse.” In 2019, Crewe won the British Journal of Photography Portrait of Britain award with the image of Grace, a doctor. What’s remarkable is that while Crewe had always been interested in photography, film and video – working with all three as a media studies teacher – she only became a professional photographer in her 40s, a few years before her win. “I was living a life that wasn’t true to myself. The joy in teaching had gone. I thought: ‘I’ve lived a half life, a careful life, a “don’t fall apart” life.’ “My husband and friends said: ‘You’ve got a safe job, a pension, sick pay – don’t give it up.’ But I’d decided: I want an adventure!” Crewe’s father died in 2019. “The survivors I photographed made me face my fears. I understood that I needed to forgive, or at least learn how to let go of my pain and anger. I am drawn to these people. My mission is to bring outsiders, other people like me, together to create our own tribe. I want my tribe to refuse to be objectified, to take agency, to confront the viewer. My work is political because it’s about human rights. The right for people to live in freedom, to realise that change is possible. My concern is that, as a society, we turn away from why we tolerate so much violence. It’s that which has to be challenged.”",News/Society,"A TV star, a chief inspector: abuse survivors look the world in the eye in remarkable project",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/24/a-tv-star-a-chief-inspector-abuse-survivors-look-the-world-in-the-eye-in-remarkable-project
4/24/2022,"The highest echelons of the US media were once again in the spotlight this week, after CNN this week abandoned a newly launched streaming service and the New York Times appointed a prominent Bostonian to lead it. CNN+ will shut down on 30 April, about a month after it was launched with a $300m investment. The new owner of the network, Warner Bros Discovery – itself the product of a $43bn merger between AT&T and the Discovery Network – decided a subscription-based streaming service was unfeasible. Only 100,000 users had signed up. The new chairman and chief executive of CNN, Chris Licht, said the decision to dump CNN+ was the product of a uniquely bad situation. “We have to own what happened, even though it’s not a result of what we did,” Licht told employees at a town hall meeting. The shelving of the service leaves in the lurch high-profile hires including the veteran Fox News journalist Chris Wallace and Kasie Hunt, formerly of NBC News and MSNBC. It is also the end of a project that encouraged top CNN reporters toward less news-focused fare such as Jake Tapper’s Book Club and Parental Guidance With Anderson Cooper. At an Oprah Winfrey-hosted company meeting on the Warner Bros lot in Burbank, California last week, David Zaslav, chief executive and president of CNN’s corporate parent, reportedly said he wanted CNN to focus on the facts and set itself apart from a cable-news industry monopolised by “advocacy networks”. “If we get that, we can have a civilized society,” Zaslav reportedly said. “And without it, if it all becomes advocacy, we don’t have a civilized society.” A board member, John Malone, has also spoken on the subject of media bias. “I would like to see CNN evolve back to the kind of journalism that it started with and actually have journalists, which would be unique and refreshing,” Malone told CNBC in November. CNN is not alone in signaling that it is abandoning a kind of reporting that arguably came to pass in an effort to counter Fox News, the far more profitable rightwing outlet known for intense audience loyalty. Addressing the bleed-through of opinion into news has also been on the menu at the New York Times, though less overtly so given the gift that would present to the paper’s enemies. This week, the controlling Sulzberger family tapped Joe Kahn, a former China correspondent, to be the new executive editor. Though top editors felt by some staff to have overlooked limitations on which opinions were fit to publish have left the paper, the publisher, AG Sulzberger, has said he believes “in the principle of openness to a range of opinions”. This week, a Times insider told New York magazine: “There is a sense – and this makes a lot of people very happy – that [Kahn] is much less willing to indulge the complaining and the constant cries of activism and that he is somebody who has expressed little patience for the newsroom culture-war eruptions that have been such a distraction for us lately.” Two weeks ago the paper’s outgoing executive editor, Dean Baquet, issued “a reset” in the paper and reporters’ approach to Twitter, long held up as having undue influence over some aspects of the Times’s editorial approach. “We’re not ordering anybody that they can’t be on Twitter,” Baquet said. “But we also just want to help people modulate it.” Like many news organizations, the Times is attempting to steer a path between those who would see the anti-democratic excesses of the right as reason to counter with greater activism from the left and those who say news organizations should be essentially non-political. “We won’t be baited into becoming ‘the opposition’, Sulzberger said in 2018. “And we won’t be applauded into becoming ‘the opposition’.” Jay Rosen, a journalism professor at New York University, said a breakdown of political discourse had created a problem for all institutions. “They all have strategies and those strategies go out of favor so they change them,” he said. “No one really knows what to do but there are different ways of faking it.” For the Times, Rosen said, carefully worded statements by Kahn and others were really saying: “There’s pressure to become more liberal and we’re not going to do that.” He said: “They think their critics and core readers want them to be pro-Joe Biden, and overlook any faults he has. They’re saying they’re not going to be intimidated by the right wing or congratulated by the left wing into doing what they want.” In February, the Times launched a new advertising campaign: Independent Journalism for an Independent Life. To Rosen, it was the carefully calibrated articulation of a shift that cannot be fully articulated. “This whole issue has been wrapped up in a bow of independence,” he said. “It’s the language they’re using to announce a shift without articulating any need for a shift.”",News/Media,"Less advocacy, more journalism.

4/24/2022,"Generations have eaten seaweed – including my mother who is from Connemara in the west of Ireland and was brought up chewing dried carrageen moss. Seaweed is not new to British or Irish culture – to urban Englanders, maybe. I first went picking seaweed about 16-17 years ago. I learned that some seaweeds are very slow growing and seasonal; you wouldn’t want to encourage a load of idiots to go and pick everything on the foreshore because it can cause a lot of damage. I make seaweed butter at Bentley’s. We dry sea lettuce and dulse seaweed, then we grind them all down. I use a bit of chopped salted anchovy or anchovy puree, then fold it all into a really good country butter at the last moment. It is the most delicious, simple thing you could eat in the world. If you’re making a potato and oyster soup, just whizz a little bit of sea lettuce in at the last moment. It gives it a wonderful iodine, coastal flavour; it’s magic, really. Seaweed tapenades work brilliantly. Take a tapenade recipe and remove any vinegar or acid content and add a good mix of finely chopped seaweed. There’s no exact recipe, just make sure the seaweed represents 50% of your mix. Roast a piece of fresh fish (sea bass, brill, bream) and add a spoonful of the tapenade. It’s quite incredible that you’re not inclined to look for a lemon.

4/24/2022,"In the mid-1990s, 4a Streatham Street in central London was arguably the hottest address in British food. By 5pm, a queue would form outside this basement noodle bar, Alan Yau’s first Wagamama, and, remembers head chef, Chi San: “As soon as we opened, the kitchen printers wouldn’t stop.” Opened in 1992, this minimalist canteen, with its communal seating and democratic pricing, chimed with the coming New Labour era. Flashy material wealth was out, “experiences” were in, says Perry Haydn Taylor, the head of branding agency Big Fish: “Hipsters were off eating in interesting places.” Did Wagamama feel revolutionary? “One hundred per cent. There was nothing like it,” says San. Pizza Express may have invented modern casual dining, but Wagamama would influence the look and feel of the fast-casual end of that market (literally, a quicker turnover of greater numbers) like few others – one of these being Nando’s, which also made its British debut in 1992. Inauspiciously opened on 1 April in suburban Ealing, Nando’s had a cooler reception. Its early branches only achieved traction as they began to focus on eat-in dining over the takeaway that had made Nando’s name in its native South Africa. This improvised UK model (fast food-style counter ordering, DIY drinks, cutlery and sauces; but attractive spaces and table service) now looks inspired. Across the UK and Ireland, Nando’s has grown into a 458-restaurant behemoth that unites grime MCs, young families and the Observer’s restaurant critic, Jay Rayner, in admiration. “It’s straightforward, well done, delicious,” says Rayner, who used Nando’s takeaways to raise household morale during lockdown. “Is it the greatest piri-piri chicken? No. But it’s very, very reliable.” Wagamama is a similar feature of British life. Yau sold it in 1998, a process that was, he told the Evening Standard, “like seeing your baby brought up by strangers”. Subsequent owners have grown Wagamama to 148 restaurants which serve around 6.5m katsu curries annually. Casual dining chains are in a chaotic period, typified by the pre-Covid collapse of Jamie’s Italian. But Nando’s and Wagamama seem future-proofed. Last year, Wagamama’s owner, the Restaurant Group, was raising finance to expand the chain, and Nando’s is planning to open 12 restaurants in 2022. Analyst Lumina Intelligence predicts both brands will buck a shrinking market. As they turn 30, how have Wagamama and Nando’s remained so fresh? And how has their influence shaped modern British dining? At the original Wagamama, the influential architect John Pawson created a clean, minimalist aesthetic still copied today. But this practical canteen space had soul. The open kitchen’s energy, the lighting, its “tactile, ergonomic” chopsticks and placemat menus all combined, says Robbie Bargh, the founder of hospitality consultants Gorgeous Group, to forge a new appreciation of the “connection between a physical space and how it makes you feel. Emotion per-square-foot, that’s what Alan Yau taught me.” This is how chains want their venues to feel, like unique manifestations of a cohesive identity. From costly mosaic facades to contemporary South African art (it owns more than 9,000 pieces), Nando’s is widely observed to have nailed that difficult task. The attitude to Wagamama’s shared bench seating was, remembers San: “Nobody will go for that.” People were no doubt equally sniffy about collecting their own cutlery at Nando’s. Yet here we are. That paring back of dining to its cost-effective basics inspired a generation of indies where no-bookings, paper menus, communal tables, cutlery in cans and rapid-fire service are the norm. Early on, Wagamama imported a futuristic pressure-cooker that could make stock in 360-litre batches. “There was a lot of technology,” says San. Today, display monitors (which split timed tasks across kitchen sections) support Wagamama “line chefs”, while at Nando’s, huge programmable Rational ovens cook the chicken before it is grilled. The aim? Simple, controlled food preparation that allows dishes to be assembled quickly, without having to recruit expensive, scarce, classically trained chefs. Yau’s “genius”, says Bargh, was identifying a product with three components: noodles, toppings, broth. Wagamama and Nando’s can train kitchen staff from scratch. The ideal became, says Haydn Taylor, producing “that quality of food quickly and scalable-y”. Largely inspired by the Japanese food available in Paris and led by a British-Chinese team (Yau, San), Wagamama was always a Euro-Asian hybrid. Authenticity and imported ingredients mattered but also moderating dishes for western palates. Nonetheless, recalls Rayner, the effect was extraordinary. Foodies may have eaten “rare, esoteric” sushi, but “Wagamama presented a different repertoire and Japanese aesthetic – ramen of a sort you probably hadn’t encountered”. Without it, would ramen bars such as Bone Daddies, Tonkotsu or Shoryu Ramen exist? Probably not. “Wagamama broadened people’s tastes on a national scale,” says David Fox, owner of Manchester’s Tampopo restaurants, whose second best-selling dish is katsu curry. “That’ll be because of Wags.” Shuko Oda, the chef-founder at London’s Koya, agrees: “Wagamama changed the way people think about Japanese food.” These days, from the cultural buzz around Korea to demand from Chinese students, the forces shaping British east-Asian food are radically different. Modern, pan-Asian Wagamama operates in the creative slipstream of, says Stefan Chomka, the editor of industry website Big Hospitality, “a new generation of Asian people doing smaller, cooler indie things”. Yet it still plays a role in familiarising diners with Japanese dishes. “It’s funny,” says Kaori Simpson, owner of Harajuku Kitchen in Edinburgh. “We’ve had teriyaki since we opened but when Wagamama does it, everybody starts liking teriyaki.” Healthy eating and protein are key food trends. The UK increasingly loves heat and is eating more poultry. All this favours perceived healthier chains where you can eat chilli-mined noodle broths or chicken in peri-peri sauce. You could stuff yourself on chips at Nando’s, but, says Chomka, “I can’t think of another casual dining restaurant that has peas, corn on the cob and rice. It’s pretty different.” Nando’s launched a supermarket grocery range in 2000, followed, years later, by everyone from Pizza Express to Wahaca. According to NielsenIQ data, Nando’s is now Britain’s fourth largest table sauce brand. “It’s astonishing,” says Daniel Woolfson, food and drink editor at The Grocer. Wagamama re-entered retail last year with a range of meal kits and stir-fry sauces, profits from which will fund the mental health charity YoungMinds. “Wagamama will do OK,” says Woolfson. “But that’s less versatile than Nando’s sauces. Never underestimate the power of convenience.” In 1996, David Chipperfield Architects wanted to “engage the queue as part of the experience” at Wagamama Soho. Today, queueing to eat at restaurants is commonplace, yet still builds anticipation and publicly demonstrates the excitement around hyped venues. Giving diners control of what and how they eat is seen as essential in modern hospitality: from customising a burger at a McDonald’s self-service screen to friends eating together at a food hall but ordering individual dishes from multiple kitchens. With its optional heat levels and bottomless drinks, says Chomka, “Nando’s understood this better than many brands”. Even paying upfront is liberating (47% of customers now order and pay on their phones): “Teenagers can eat together but pay separately without worrying about splitting the bill, then leave when they want. Control is with the customer.” Wagamama and Nando’s constantly cultivate the next generation of diners. In that regard, says Mowgli owner, Nisha Katona, the restaurant industry owes them: “Those 16-, 17-year-olds could have done anything with their pocket money. No, they put on shoes, went out, behaved at a table. That is our future.” Last October, Wagamama announced a new 50% plant-based menu, which comes with text gently encouraging us to fight the climate crisis in our dining habits, a clear overture to young, eco-conscious diners. Such tactics are no doubt among the reasons for Wagamama regularly ranking highly in YouGov’s poll of most popular dining brands among millennials. Nando’s, which also ranks highly in the poll, has the youth vote locked, crucially because of a decade-long love-in with the music world, pop and grime stars in particular (Ed Sheeran and Example’s Nando’s Skank freestyle; creating a halloumi #MERKY burger for Stormzy; onstage shout-outs from Adele). Some fans are starting their own food businesses. In 2011’s Tinie Tempah: My Story So Far, the MC recalls eating at Nando’s and thinking: “Whoa, I’m moving up in the world.” In February, he opened the fried chicken delivery brand Raps with the YouTube chef Big Has. A marketing masterstroke also known as the High Five card and supposedly given to celeb fans, entitling them to free Nando’s for a year. (The official Nando’s line is that “no one who’s requested a card, no matter how politely, has ever received one”.) This year, Pizza Express has started awarding “bling rings” to notable musicians and avid, randomly selected users of its loyalty app, entitling them to free pizza. Nando’s UK social media (Twitter, 1.2m followers, Instagram, 401,000; numbers that dwarf Wagamama’s) is in its tone – jokey, knowing – a masterclass in millennial engagement and shareable content. Music takeovers for International Women’s Day, silly tweets about halloumi sticks or gravy mayo, reworks of memes or TikTok recipes for pasta dishes using Nando’s hot sauces, mingle easily with student campaigns around GCSEs or Booth Truths, a roundtable discussion covering everything from mental health to entrepreneurship, with panellists including rapper Ms Banks, footballer Rio Ferdinand, YouTuber Chunkz and comedian Kae Kurd. “They know their brand, their target 16-25 market and what they’re interested in, inside out,” says Jules Pearson, vice-president of food and beverage creative development at Ennismore hotels. “It feels authentic, not like they’re scrambling to get viral content or sales.” On issues of equality, Nando’s has, in South African TV adverts or posters distributed in Washington DC prior to Trump’s inauguration, repeatedly taken progressive stances. Those posters stated: “Nando’s … is an Immigrant EMPLOYING, Gay LOVING, Muslim RESPECTING, Racism OPPOSING, Equal PAYING, Multi CULTURAL chicken restaurant where #everyoneiswelcome.” Yes, this is marketing. In a 2019 interview at Harvard Business School, cofounder Robert Brozin talked of “intellectual controversy” being part of Nando’s “brand personality” – its irreverence and slogans have, at times, attracted criticism. But forged in post-apartheid South Africa, Brozin insists “a culture of diversity” is core at Nando’s. Scroll back through years of Nando’s UK ads and online content and the prominence of black and brown faces is striking. It has taken practical steps on inclusivity too, opening 77 halal branches in Britain. Nando’s takes a “neighbourhood” approach to expansion, says Chomka, driven by local demographics: “It’s built from the ground up where most brands feel built from the boardroom out.” If the clientele in Nando’s restaurants is modern, multiracial Britain made manifest, it could be because it engages its audience in a genuine, holistic way. “Nando’s does an effective job,” says Mursal Saiq, co-owner of the halal London barbecue restaurant, Cue Point. “It doesn’t market [halal] all over but enough that the Muslim community is aware. That’s the integrated environment one wants. However, they should have halal options at all branches, it seems almost paradoxical not to.”",Lifestyle/Food,"Thirty years of Nando’s, Wagamama and a British food revolution",https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/apr/24/thirty-years-of-nandos-wagamama-and-a-british-food-revolution
4/24/2022,"Audrey Diwan’s furiously empathic Venice Golden Lion-winning drama brings a sickening, ticking-clock urgency to the plight of a young female student. Anne (a compelling Anamaria Vartolomei) is faced with the choice between carrying an unplanned pregnancy to term, at the expense of her hopes, ambitions and considerable academic promise, or risking imprisonment or worse by seeking an illegal backstreet abortion. The film, adapted from the autobiographical novel of the same name by Annie Ernaux, is set in northern France in the early 1960s. It is emphatically timely, however, both in approach – period details are deliberately downplayed – and themes. The film opens in the UK in the same month that Kentucky became the first US state to “completely and immediately” block access to terminations. Happening is a visceral, confronting experience: the dispassionately procedural depictions of two attempted terminations are almost unwatchably gruelling. But the film’s real power comes not from the brutal assault of these scenes, which match those of Myroslav Slaboshpytskiy’s The Tribe for unflinching horror, but from the emotional connection that Diwan deftly creates between Anne and an audience that finds itself living her trauma rather than just watching it.",Arts/Film,Happening review: unflinching abortion drama that draws you in,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/24/happening-review-unflinching-french-abortion-drama
4/24/2022,"We’ve all been at it – shifting our shopping online even before it was actually illegal to go into shops. Pre-pandemic, 20% of our retailing was online, a proportion that surged to over 35% during lockdowns, before falling back more recently. We talk a lot about what this means for the decline of high streets or the growth in delivery vehicles (I spent last week dodging a fleet of Amazon Prime vans in rural Suffolk). But the online delivery revolution is heralding a wider transformation of our economic geography. This was spelt out by great new research from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) last week. It’s no surprise the number of business properties used for warehouses, logistics and transport has almost doubled in the last decade. The growth over the pandemic particularly stands out – a 21% rise since 2019 is more than four times the rate of any other industry. Last year saw the highest new orders for warehouse construction on record – more than £5bn worth, doubling the pre-pandemic norms. These trends are transforming the industrial mix of some parts of the country – specifically the middle of it. The East Midlands alone accounted for 20% of that spending on new warehouses . In 2011, not one local authority had transport and storage as its dominant industry, but 11 did by 2021. These include Rugby (next to the M1) and Peterborough and Doncaster (off the A1). The ONS argues that we’re seeing a new “golden logistics triangle”, stretching from Birmingham across to Northamptonshire and up into Yorkshire. So if your delivery is delayed, you now know who to blame: the (greater) Midlands.  Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation.

4/24/2022,"Seventeen years ago, Punchdrunk began to change the way I felt. I remember my first encounter with the company in a misty factory near the Oval. And my transforming moment coming out of Faust in a five-storey Docklands warehouse a year later: the experience was so all-encompassing I had to shake myself into everyday life and architecture, eyes shrinking and expanding. Felix Barrett, the artistic director, and the choreographer Maxine Doyle have also altered the theatre – in entirely unexpected ways. They don’t produce new words; their shows are mostly silent. They don’t directly suggest social or political change, or offer a new version of character. Yet their shows – in which the audience mingle with the action, spectators deciding what they see – involve an intense refocusing, a hesitation between being lost and taking control. Barrett and his co-director Doyle do not describe what they do as “immersive theatre”. Rightly: the term suggests a tour around an ancient kitchen where someone dressed up in a pinny and mobcap says hello to you over a saucepan. Punchdrunk alter the very texture of things: they provide microscopic, drilling detail, but at the same time they swivel an audience’s sense of space. The company have not had a large show in London for nine years – though there have been performances in New York and Shanghai – and they have never had a permanent home in this country. Now they have settled in Woolwich, making 100,000 sq ft of two former ammunitions factories into performance spaces. These vast industrial buildings seem capable of conjuring a sense of infinite area. Where better to think about war, the waging of it and its devastating effects. The current embracing of all things classical – the National has just announced that a large-scale adaptation of The Odyssey will take place across the country next year – involves a search for a vocabulary that can encompass arbitrary and predictable terrors: blows from the gods and cycles of revenge horror. The Burnt City, a vision of the siege of Troy, draws on Aeschylus’s Agamemnon and Euripides’s Hecuba. It is not so much a re-enactment as a response to these works. The audience enters through the mock-up of an archaeological exhibition about Troy, which introduces the idea of sifting layers of evidence and significance. From then on, everyone’s experience will be slightly different. Speech is banned and spectators are obliged to wear bone-white masks covering foreheads and noses. Actors are the only ones with faces here; scenes are surrounded by a throng of identical blank, beaky stares. Audiences can try to piece together stories by following one actor, or drift around the space, soaking and accumulating. Their movement becomes part of the disturbing current of the evening. Some rummage through rooms turning over objects as if they were sanitary inspectors or spies; others push people aside to be close to their favourite character. Everyone is likely in turn to feel bewilderment, exasperation, quickening, wonder. Two buildings hold the Greek and the Trojan experience. Neither is simply classical but inflected by references to Fritz Lang’s Metropolis and Weimar decadence, with costumes nodding to Alexander McQueen. In the Greek city of Mycenae, sand is underfoot in a cavernous space where huge wooden beams, balanced against each other like crosses, stand in swirling, smoky light. There is the roar of storm and melancholy calls from woodwind. Scenes are delivered sometimes as ritual, sometimes as dance fragments, body-bending fights, gymnastic mysteries. Sometimes you have to let go of clarity: I don’t mind that I don’t know who the character was who, making his hammock into a trapeze, twisted so dextrously that he seemed himself to be a piece of canvas. The clearest storyline belongs to Iphigenia. Under a billowing canvas, the campaign headquarters of her father Agamemnon is reconstructed as a mix of classical references and an early 20th-century office: dial phones, manual typewriter, a painting of Clytemnestra above the desk and a letter warning of prophecies. Iphigenia’s bedroom – that of a young girl who thinks she is off to be married – is exquisitely constructed with a doll’s house and soft toys; a floral diary contains love lyrics copied out by hand, and a magazine snippet about June brides. She goes to meet her lover on one of those cruciform beams; she is sacrificed there by her father. Driving narrative is not Punchdrunk’s strong suit. Actually, the more driving (as in their 2009 It Felt Like a Kiss) the less original. They are creators of distilled moments. Crossing a border checkpoint into Troy, reimagined as a hub of decadence, you can see the Hotel Elysium (“no refunds”), a room in a tenement building with a half-eaten supper congealing in a Baby Belling, and a woman writhing in all-over leather as she waits for her dealer; Willow Weep for Me is playing. Almost most impressive are the apparently redundant rooms, places that might have been left as sketches but are meticulously realised: a taproom that has kegs of “Styx” and “Hades”; a pottery shop with rows of tiny clay figures of Poseidon and Athena. The most static scenes can contain an inward energy: magnificently, they urge you to look for the past that has made them. Mike Bartlett’s latest play (two others, Cock and The 47th are still running) provides a quick glow but fades rapidly. Scandaltown aims to show present tawdriness through a pastiche of Restoration comedy. It is far from an idle choice – nor a niche one. The Restoration meant the return of stage life after puritanical lockdown; now theatre is back after pandemic. Satirists of the period could draw on hypocrisy, flamboyant foppishness and grotesque striving. So can we. Bartlett prepares a jaunty mix of current aberrance and Restoration ostentatious absurdity. Hannah Tweetwell and Freddie Peripheral (“I’m a supporting character”) feature in a plot that involves country innocence blundering into city adulteration, intergenerational insults (“vegan waif”), social media fallout, high-speed delivery and palpitating phrasing. The high point of Rachel O’Riordan’s production is a looming and dashing performance from Rachael Stirling as Lady Climber, down on her luck because of a misguided tweet, swaggering in a mysterious (you have to be there) coat with a helter-skelter collar, given the promising but underdeveloped trait of a woman who doesn’t want children: “Hi, I’m your mother,” she sighs. The pivot of the plot is a muddle in the bedchambers that involves a recognisably shambling MP – “Matt Eton, secretary of state for procurement” – and results in Stirling having some difficulty sitting down: “Who would have thought he’d be so thorough?” Bartlett could write a satire that would shake us, but despite its bounce, Scandaltown is not that play. Not least of its problems is the competition: hard these days to beat the House of Commons for dramatic displays of venality.
