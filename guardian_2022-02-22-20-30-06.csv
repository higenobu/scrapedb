2/22/2022,"Over the past few weeks, President Joe Biden has repeatedly emphasized his friendship with Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell. At the National Prayer Breakfast in early February, for instance, he praised McConnell as “a man of your word. And you’re a man of honor. Thank you for being my friend.” Biden’s publicly professed affinity is weirdly at odds with the political situation. Going back to the Obama era, McConnell has led the Republican Party in a strategy of near-total obstruction which he has pursued with ruthless cynicism. It is true that he has, at times, signaled distance to Donald Trump and condemned the January 6 insurrection. But McConnell is also sabotaging any effort to counter the Republican party’s ongoing authoritarian assault on the political system.  The distinct asymmetry in the way the two sides treat each other extends well beyond Biden and McConnell. Republicans immediately derided Biden’s pledge to nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court – while Democratic leaders are hoping for bipartisan support; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi insists the nation needs a strong Republican party – meanwhile radicals like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar, who fantasize about committing acts of violence against Democrats, are embraced by fellow Republicans, proving they are not just a extremist fringe that has “hijacked” the Party, as Pelosi suggested. And when Texas senator Ted Cruz recently intimated that Republicans would impeach Biden if they were to retake the House “whether it’s justified or not,” the White House responded by calling on Cruz to “work with us on getting something done.” Republicans could not be clearer about the fact that they consider Democratic governance fundamentally illegitimate, yet some establishment Democrats act as if politics as usual is still an option and a return to “normalcy” imminent. There is certainly an element of political strategy in all of this. Democrats are eager to present themselves as a force of moderation and unity. But Biden’s longing for understanding across party lines seems sincere. He has been reluctant to make the fight against the Republican party’s assault on democracy the center piece of his agenda; Democratic leadership has proved mostly unwilling to focus the public’s attention on the Republican party’s authoritarian turn. One important explanatory factor is that many Democratic leaders are old. They came up in a very different political environment, when there was indeed a great deal of bipartisan cooperation in Congress. There is no reason to be nostalgic about this – the politics of bipartisan consensus more often than not stifled racial and social progress. But there was certainly an established norm of intra-party cooperation until quite recently. When California senator Dianne Feinstein hugged South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham at the end of the Amy Coney Barrett hearings in 2020, it was a bizarre throwback to those days of amity across party lines in the midst of a naked Republican power grab. Beyond institutional tradition and personal familiarity, this inability to grapple in earnest with the post-Obama reality in which Democratic politicians are almost universally considered members of an “Un-American” faction by most Republicans has deeper ideological roots. The way some establishment Democrats have acted suggests they feel a kinship with their Republican opponents grounded in a worldview of white elite centrism. Their perspective on the prospect of a white reactionary regime is influenced by the fact that, consciously or not, they understand that their elite status wouldn’t necessarily be affected all that much. The Republican dogma – that the world works best if it’s run by prosperous white folks – has a certain appeal to wealthy white elites, regardless of party. From that vantage point, it is rational to believe that the bigger immediate threat is coming from the “Left”: an agenda seeking to transform America from a restricted, white men’s democracy that largely preserved existing hierarchies to a functioning multiracial, pluralistic, social democracy is indeed a losing proposition for people who have traditionally been at the top. When Biden insists that “I’m not Bernie Sanders. I’m not a socialist”, and instead emphasizes his friendship with Mitch McConnell, he offers more than strategic rhetoric. Many establishment Democrats seem to believe that it is high time to push back against the “radical” forces of leftism and “wokeism.” The constant attempts to normalize a radicalizing Republican Party also have a lot to do with two foundational myths that shape the collective imaginary: the myth of American exceptionalism and the myth of white innocence. We may be decades removed from the heyday of the so-called “liberal consensus” of the postwar era, but much of the country’s Democratic elite still subscribes to an exceptionalist understanding that America is fundamentally good and the US inexorably on its way to overcoming whatever vestigial problems there might still be. This often goes hand in hand with a mythical tale of America’s past, describing democracy as being exceptionally stable. Never mind that genuine multiracial democracy has actually existed for less than 60 years in this country. What could possibly threaten America’s supposedly “old, consolidated” democracy? Acknowledging what the Republican party has become goes against the pillars of that worldview. Finally, the American political discourse is still significantly shaped by the paradigm of white innocence. Economic anxiety, anti-elite backlash, or just liberals being mean – whatever animates white people’s extremism, it must not be racism, and they cannot be blamed for their actions. The dogma of white innocence leads to elite opinion instinctively sanitizing the reasons behind the rise of rightwing demagogues, a common tendency in the commentary surrounding the success of George Wallace in the late 1960s, David Duke in early 1990s, or Donald Trump in 2016. The idea of white innocence also clouds Democratic elites’ perspective on Republican elites: Since they cannot possibly be animated by reactionary white nationalism, they must be motivated by more benign forces, fear of the Trumpian base perhaps, or maybe they are being seduced by the dangerous demagogue. “I actually like Mitch McConnell,” Biden said during a press conference a few weeks ago, providing a window into what he sees in Republicans: No matter what they do, underneath they’re good guys, they’ll snap out of it. Promise. It’s the manifestation of a specific worldview that makes it nearly impossible to acknowledge the depths of Republican radicalization – a perspective that severely hampers the fight for the survival of American democracy.

2/22/2022,"Oti Mabuse has announced she is leaving Strictly Come Dancing after seven years as a professional dance partner. Sharing the news on Instagram, she said: “Never easy to say goodbye. I have been part of the most amazing TV show, Strictly Come Dancing for the past seven years and it has been an incredible time.  “Lifting the glitterball twice and having the best journey with all my celebrities, but also meeting and working with the best team, crew, producers, celebs and incredible professional dancers! You are my family and I adore you all forever.” Born in South Africa, Mabuse, 31, studied civil engineering before moving to Germany to dance. The Latin American and ballroom dancer, who won the South African Latin American championship eight times, was crowned Strictly winner both in 2019 with the actor Kelvin Fletcher and in 2020 with comedian Bill Bailey. Over the last year, she has taken a seat on the judging panels of BBC One’s The Greatest Dancer, ITV’s The Masked Singer and most recently ITV’s Dancing on Ice – leading to speculation that she may not return to the Strictly ballroom. Her new BBC radio show, Oti Mabuse’s Dancing Legends, explores the people who have changed the course of dance, including Fred Astaire and Raven Wilkinson. She has said the show was inspired partly by Bailey, who taught her to “go back in time and find the root of the purpose of what you’re doing”. Mabuse said on Tuesday she was “honestly so grateful to the BBC and will always remember that Strictly and BBC brought me to the UK – which I now call home and I have learned and grown so much. Thank you from the bottom of my heart”. She added: “I can’t put into words how difficult this decision has been, but I have decided not to return for the next series. “Dance will always be my first love and to everyone, my family especially, friends, strictly fans and judges who have been my support throughout my strictly journey. Thank you for being incredible! You are irreplaceable in my heart and have made everyday unforgettable! I love you.” In a statement, BBC Strictly said Mabuse’s “energy, creativity and talent” had contributed to many of the show’s most memorable moments. “She will be hugely missed, not only by viewers, but the entire team.” Earlier this month, the dancer spoke out about the “racially abusive” and “fat-shaming” comments she received after performing on the show. “I’ve never really spoken about it because I’ve tried for so long to think about it this way: I work on a show that 10 million people love; if 10 or 100 people aren’t nice to me, that is not representative of everyone else’s views,” she said.",Arts/Television & radio,Oti Mabuse to leave Strictly Come Dancing after seven years,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/22/oti-mabuse-to-leave-strictly-come-dancing-after-seven-years

The beauty and benefits start almost as soon as you cast on, since the growing garment on your knees keeps you warm long before it’s ready to wear. Win-win! Carol Brook, West Yorkshire  A hot drink goes a long way towards keeping you warm during winter, and wearing a wool hat indoors makes an amazing difference, too. It’s also important not to allow the house to get damp, as that always feels much colder, so we run a dehumidifier every now and again to keep everything dry. It has not been too cold a winter this year, so there have been lots of days when we haven’t had the heating on at all. Gill Lee, admin worker, Leicester Make yourself a bowl of porridge in the morning, topped with maple syrup and just the slightest splash of Islay whisky. It gives your breakfast a beautiful peaty, sugary smell and a bit of extra warmth on the way down. I learned about this delight while staying at a B&B on Islay some years ago. It takes the porridge, and the start of the day, to a new level. Richard Knight, leadership coach and consultant, East Lothian I can sometimes feel a little chilled but, rather than turn the heating up, I find that doing the dishes warms me right up. Plunging my hands into warm bubbles always does the trick, and it saves on the energy used to run a dishwasher, too. Add a little relaxing music and it can be a useful mindfulness exercise. Also, the dishes get done. Anonymous, Scotland In the colder months in Norway, when there is also a lot of rain, snow, and ice, I walk a lot: to work, for shopping or other errands, and in the nearby woods. It takes a bit of motivation to bundle up and go outside, but you get warm in no time. Your cheeks glow and your eyes clear in the cold air, and you begin to enjoy the sights, sounds and smells of the outdoors. To me, engaging with the winter landscape using all my senses makes winter much more fun. On snowy days, the woods are silent, enveloping and quite cosy, actually. I also love coming home, kindling a fire in the stove and snuggling in an armchair with a book. Indra Simhan, child psychiatrist, Norway I recommend double-socking. One (inner) pair of ordinary socks, preferably made from natural fibre, then an outer, woolly pair. My current favourite is alpaca as this means I can buy British from yarn to sock, and they can be darned, too. Keep the inner pair on as you get into bed … I find I’m usually warm enough to take them off before I’ve finished my bedtime hot drink. Anonymous, Worcestershire My mum’s parsnip soup recipe is super-easy and cheap to make. I love how thick it is. The trick to its warming (but not spicy) flavour is the garam masala. Simply mix one chopped onion with two teaspoons of garam masala and sauté in oil until soft. Add 1 litre of chicken or vegetable stock, 250ml of milk (almond milk if vegan) and five or six medium-sized parsnips. Simmer for 10-15 minutes until soft, then blend. Season to taste and serve. Simon, London The energy crisis and rocketing costs mean you can’t just jack up the heating – and anyway, too warm a room feels stuffy. Instead, wear layers. Start with a short-sleeved T-shirt, then add one with long sleeves, then a warm jumper, and top off with a gilet. A warm core helps keep hands and feet warmer than gloves or socks can, although knee-length socks are good for keeping cold draughts out. Soft, warm scarves are good at that, too. Nora Boswell, retired, Bradford I love a hot-water bottle – even before I started working from home, I was known to attend work meetings with one clutched close. They help with cramps and chronic pain, but they’re also great for feeling warm and cosy, and I find them so comforting. For Christmas, I was given a long hot-water bottle that can be tied around you – it’s an absolute gamechanger. Now, I potter around my flat with what feels like a nice warm hug around my waist.

2/22/2022,"Good morning. Russia faced western sanctions and bitter condemnation at the UN after Vladimir Putin ordered troops over the Ukrainian border into Moscow-controlled territories in the east of the country, which he had recognised hours earlier.  With reports of Russian armoured columns advancing into Donetsk and Luhansk under the guise of “peacekeepers” in the Russian-backed enclaves, the US imposed some limited sanctions and warned more would come today. The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, has dismissed Vladimir’s Putin’s assertion that the troops heading into the Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine would take on a “peacekeeping” role. At a fiery emergency meeting of the security council in New York she said: “He calls them peacekeepers. This is nonsense. We know what they really are.” A spokesperson for the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said he “considers the decision of the Russian Federation to be a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations”. Is this the start of something bigger? The UK minister Sajid Javid said this morning it was clear an invasion had already begun. The US and UK believe that the Russian entry into the eastern tip of Ukraine is a precursor for a more sweeping invasion. What does Russian recognition of breakaway Ukraine territories mean? It could pave the way for Moscow to send military forces into the separatist areas openly, using the argument that it is intervening as an ally to protect them against Ukraine. The fallout from a huge leak of Credit Suisse banking data threatened to damage Switzerland’s entire financial sector yesterday after the European parliament’s main political grouping raised the prospect of adding the country to a money-laundering blacklist. The European People’s party (EPP), the largest political grouping of the European parliament, called for the EU to review its relationship with Switzerland and consider whether it should be added to its list of countries associated with a high risk of financial crime. Experts said that such a move would be a disaster for Switzerland’s financial sector, which would face the kind of enhanced due diligence applied to transactions linked to rogue nations including Iran, Myanmar, Syria and North Korea. The investigation, called Suisse secrets, identified clients of the Swiss bank who had been involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes.

The leaders of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and Spirit Lake Nation have sued North Dakota, alleging that a new legislative map for the state, which was meant to account for population changes identified in the 2020 census, doesn’t comply with section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The lawsuit, filed earlier this month, claims the map packs some Indigenous voters into one house subdistrict, while putting other “nearby Native American voters into two other districts dominated by white voters who bloc vote against Native Americans’ preferred candidates”. It adds that complying with the Voting Rights Act would mean placing the two nations in a single district, where they would “comprise an effective, geographically compact majority”. “Our voice is going to be muffled once again,” the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa chairman, Jamie Azure, told the Guardian. “It’s getting a little sickening, tell you the truth.” Indigenous people in the US have faced generations of voting restrictions. Although Indigenous people were granted citizenship in 1924, it took more than three decades before they were considered eligible to vote in every state.

There’s a strand of thinking, from sci-fi films to Stephen Hawking, that suggests artificial intelligence (AI) could spell doom for humans.

2/22/2022,"Almost 15,000 “ghost flights” have departed from the UK, according to newly revealed official figures. The ghost flights, defined as those with no passengers or less than 10% of passenger capacity, operated from all 32 airports listed in the data. Heathrow was top, with 4,910 ghost flights between March 2020 and September 2021. Manchester and Gatwick were the next highest. There were an average of 760 ghost flights a month over the period, although the data only covered international departure and not domestic flights.  Flying is one of the most carbon intensive activities people can undertake and ghost flights have angered those campaigning for action on the climate crisis. German airline Lufthansa recently warned it would have to fly 18,000 “unnecessary” flights by March in order to keep its landing slots at airports. Under current rules, airlines lose their valuable slots if they are not sufficiently used. However, during the pandemic-hit period covered by the new UK data, the slot rules that had required 80% of slots to be used were completely suspended. Airlines did not have to operate flights to retain the slots, but nonetheless flew 14,472 ghost flights. “Flights may operate with a low number of passengers for a range of reasons,” said aviation minister Robert Courts, who produced the data in response to a parliamentary question. “Since the onset of the pandemic, the government has provided alleviation from the normal slot regulations. This means that airlines have not been required to operate empty or almost empty flights solely to retain their historic slots rights.” Labour MP Alex Sobel, who asked the question and is chair of the net zero all-party parliamentary group, said: “To really tackle the climate emergency we need to ensure that our aviation sector is as efficient as it can be with its carbon output.” Anna Hughes, at Flight Free UK and whose parliamentary petition on the issue now has 11,000 signatories, said: ”At a time of climate emergency we need to be drastically reducing our use of fossil fuel, not burning it in empty planes.” Slot rules were partially restored in October 2021, requiring 50% usage and this will rise to 7e0% at the end of March. “If more than 14,000 empty flights took off from UK airports when there was no requirement to retain landing slots, how many more will have taken off since?” said Hughes. “Of course, all flights harm the climate, which is why we also campaign for a reduction in demand, a tax on aviation fuel and more affordable trains. But preventing planes from flying empty should be an easy win for policy-makers and the climate.” Tim Johnson at the Aviation Environment Federation said: “Information [on ghost flights] is hidden from public view, with airlines avoiding scrutiny by claiming the data is proprietary. No doubt airlines fear reputational damage, but the public and consumers should be informed. It shouldn’t take a parliamentary question to expose the scale of this wasteful practice.” “The number of flights may be small in comparison to the overall total, but the effects on our climate add up when you consider the average short-haul flight emits between 13 and 20 tonnes of CO2,” he said. The Guardian asked the Department for Transport for data on ghost flights in January, but was told the DfT did not hold this data. The Civil Aviation Authority, which provided the new data to the government, refused a freedom of information request from the Guardian, saying it did not have the consent of the airlines to release it. Slot rules are monitored and enforced by a company called Airport Coordination Limited, but it told the Guardian passenger numbers on flights could only come from the airlines themselves. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic told the Guardian they did not operate ghost flights to retain slots, but declined to provide data on the occupancy of their flights. A spokesperson for Virgin Atlantic said: “Covid-19 had an unprecedented impact on customer demand, with wide-ranging global restrictions that limited international travel. For three months during 2020, Virgin Atlantic did not operate any passenger flights. Any lower-occupancy flights that operated outside of this window were not ‘ghost flights’ – they supported the global movement of people including returning foreign citizens and repatriated UK citizens.” Both airlines said the increase in the required slot usage to 70%, the highest in the world, would lead to low-occupancy flights. Luis Gallego, chief executive at IAG, BA’s parent company, said: “This decision would force airlines to operate flights with low load factors which will generate unnecessary CO2 emissions. This is bad for the environment and detrimental to aviation’s efforts to tackle climate change.” Ryanair and easyjet did not respond to requests for comment. Johnson said the slot system was unsustainable and outdated and that reform was needed:, adding “Slots at congested airports can exchange hands for millions of pounds each so there are very strong incentives for airlines to keep using them, even when passenger demand is very low. The government should rule out airport expansion and instead focus on slot reform and other efficiency improvements.”",News/Environment,"Almost 15,000 ‘ghost flights’ left UK since pandemic began",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/22/almost-15000-ghost-flights-left-uk-since-pandemic-began
2/22/2022,"The lifting of Covid restrictions in England will lead to a further rise in home schooling and the “forced exclusion” of immunosuppressed pupils whose families will be too scared to send them to school, an academy trust leader has warned. Steve Chalke, the founder of the Oasis academy trust of 52 schools, said the scrapping of twice-weekly testing in school communities and the legal requirement to self-isolate after a positive test was “a huge gamble”.  He said he feared many immunosuppressed pupils – and those living with vulnerable relatives – would be effectively excluded from school because of families’ health fears. “They will not be able to afford to take the gamble,” Chalke said. Boris Johnson told the Commons on Monday it was time to move from “government restrictions to personal responsibility”. The legal requirement to self-isolate will end on Thursday, after which those testing positive, including school staff and pupils, will initially be advised to stay at home. After 1 April it will be down to personal responsibility. Chalke, whose schools work with many of the most disadvantaged children and vulnerable families, said: “I think it will become a forced form of exclusion of those who are vulnerable, those immunosuppressed children and staff who are put at increased risk. Also staff who are living with their own immunosuppressed children. “I think we will see a group of children turning away from education. It will lead to a further rise in home education – it can be a route for those who are worried or scared. All of this will play together in some unhelpful ways. “The gamble in my mind is that attendance among many of the most vulnerable stops or goes down, so it becomes a form of exclusion. Removing the requirement for positive cases to self-isolate puts them all at increased risk.” Councils in England reported in November that there had been a “rapid surge” in the number of parents choosing to take their children out of school to teach them at home, with a 34% jump in pupils being electively home educated on the previous year’s figures. The Department for Education (DfE) is also concerned about attendance, which stood at 86.2% in secondary schools on 3 February, while pre-Covid it would be about 95%. Chalke’s fears were echoed by Ben Davis, the headteacher at St Ambrose Barlow RC high school in Swinton, Manchester. “Without routine testing, isolation and access to free tests it will be much harder to manage the pandemic in schools and this will work against the most disadvantaged who are more likely to be ill, suffer more and have less access to testing,” he said. “There will be plenty of parents, carers, pupils and staff who will genuinely fear being exposed to infected cases now that they no longer need to test and isolate.” Simon Hyde, the general secretary of the Headmasters’ & Headmistresses’ Conference, which represents independent schools, agreed. He said: “These changes could pose additional risks for children and staff that are clinically vulnerable, or have a family member who is vulnerable.” The government is still advising regular testing in special schools, alternative provision and special educational needs units in mainstream schools and colleges. An update to the DfE website said that if parents thought their child had Covid they should not send them to school. “Good ventilation, hygiene and encouraging vaccination uptake, as well as following any additional advice from local directors of public health, are the best measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in education settings,” it said.",News/Education,Lifting of Covid rules in England ‘will lead to rise in home schooling’,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/22/covid-rules-england-home-schooling-rise-forced-exclusion-vulnerable-pupils
2/22/2022,"Given the scale of the environmental challenges facing their world, you can forgive teenagers for feeling pretty muddled. They know that action needs to be taken without delay; their parents and teachers preach patience and circumspection and tell them they’re too young to take matters into their own hands. For every steel-eyed Greta Thunberg, you can be sure there are a dozen or more like the title characters of this play, for whom fear for their future and anger at adults’ apathy will only exacerbate the maelstrom of teenage emotion. Sixteen-year-old Zoe, suspended from school by a headteacher who deems her “too excitable”, strains with resolve and frustration. Through sheer force of character (AKA bossiness) she convinces her new neighbour, Rain, to drive her across country on his inherited motorcycle, from their west coast home to a protest against a polluting oil company in Philadelphia, where Zoe may or may not find her long-absent mother. Along the way, the naive pair get lost, fall in love and argue about what constitute legitimate forms of protest, before accidentally turning into the Bonnie and Clyde of glitter-bombing pipelines.  Unfortunately, their understandably messy emotional states (Rain frequently finds himself speaking to his dead father, Zoe conjures the moon as her mother) are matched by the untidiness of Crystal Skillman’s story, which is too flimsily constructed to bear the weight of the big themes it’s asked to carry. The plot careers off into a second half of increasingly unbelievable action (how two kids who don’t know how to pitch a tent manage to infiltrate an oil refinery is a mystery). But it is presented with great verve by its likable leads, Jordan Benjamin and Mei Henri, and designed with panache by Zoe Hurwitz; there is inventiveness too, from Richard Holt and Salma Shaw, who play all the other characters and the road scenes in which they become the motorbike are a highpoint of Hersh Ellis’s direction.

2/22/2022,"It’s funny, isn’t it, childbirth? Periodically, someone says something true about whether or not it hurts (I won’t pick a side here), and there’s a flurry of panic that people will be put off doing it and that’ll be the end of the species. In real life, nobody has ever been discouraged from reproducing by its harsh realities, any more than Roy Orbison could deter you from falling in love. Pain is very abstract until it’s almost upon you, and by then it’s too late. But that isn’t the main charge against This Is Going to Hurt, the BBC’s adaptation of former doctor Adam Kay’s ward diary. Rather, it’s that the series, and by inference the diaries themselves, lift the lid on the casual disrespect, bordering on misogyny, with which obstetricians treat mothers. This, again, is a hardy perennial. As a criticism of Kay, it’s way off: the system he describes is of doctors so overstretched as to leave you in awe.  Yet anyone brushing against medics in the business of producing young invariably feels, on some level, after some encounters, patronised or undermined or disregarded. It can be the truly insufferable habit of using the word “discomfort” when a better word is “agony” (though, in fairness, the real devils for this are dental hygienists). It can be the feverish overpolicing of behaviours in pregnancy, while at the same time, genuine reported problems are minimised: so everyone’s got time to give you a 10-minute lecture on blue cheese, yet is magically way too busy to hear about your debilitating morning sickness. It certainly isn’t just a cultural problem within the NHS, it transcends all borders; Naomi Wolf, back when she was a feminist icon and 20 years before she was suspended from Twitter for spreading vaccine misinformation, wrote Misconceptions about obstetrics in the US; the C-section scene in marketised healthcare sounded terrifying. What’s really hard to take is the drop in status. You go through your entire life interacting with medicine, if you’re lucky quite infrequently, as a person, and then suddenly – even if you’re still lucky, very frequently – you’re interacting as more of a vessel. You’re an inconvenient interface between medic and baby; it would help everyone considerably if you could perform this role as quietly as possible. The hot indignation of being suddenly a non-person is worse, considerably worse, than the fact that you’re already literally too hot. My hunch is that this has been true since long before medicine.

2/22/2022,"Danya KukafkaPhoenix, £16.99, pp272  From Thomas Harris’s Hannibal Lecter to Bret Easton Ellis’s Patrick Bateman, serial killers stalk the pages of fiction, their actions and motivations drawing readers back again and again. But how many of us can remember the names of their victims; how many of us have imagined what their lives might have been, if they hadn’t crossed paths with their killers? Just as the true crime genre is starting to upend the narrative of the killer – in Hallie Rubenhold’s award-winning The Five, the women murdered by Jack the Ripper are given their own space on the page – so Danya Kukafka’s Notes on an Execution looks at the women left behind as murderer Ansel Packer awaits his fate on death row. The clock is ticking towards Ansel’s death as he plots his escape, and gloats over the “Theory” he will leave behind for the world to read. His crimes may be horrific, but Kukafka isn’t out to explore the origin story of the murderer. Instead, she tells us about his mother, Lavender, who was 17 when Ansel was born and subject to a world that slowly closed around her in the Adirondack mountains. “Until the time came, Lavender did not understand what it meant to walk away from a thing she’d grown from her own insides.” Lavender’s story is bruising, and brave – but so is Hazel’s. She’s the twin of Jenny, the girl who married Ansel; Hazel watches as her sister is consumed by her relationship with Ansel, helpless as it destroys her. “Why did he do it?” ask the reporters, but Hazel doesn’t care: it doesn’t matter how Ansel felt. “There are millions of men out there who want to hurt women – people seem to think that Ansel Packer is extraordinary, because he did.” And Kukafka tells of Saffron Singh, the detective who has been on Ansel’s trail for years – who knew him as a boy, saw what he was capable of then. As the world moves on from the three girls Ansel murdered, leaving the mystery unsolved, Saffy persists. She can’t stop thinking about who the murdered girls – Izzy, Angela, Lila – might have been. “The possibilities stalked and haunted – the infinite number of lives they had not lived… There were so many things a girl could be,” she thinks. And later, at a vigil for them: “Saffy feels slimy, the truth prickling. There would be no story, for these girls alone. There would be no vigil, no attention at all. They are relevant because of Ansel and the fascination the world has for men like him.” Notes on an Execution is Kukafka’s second novel, after Girl in Snow, which explored the death of a high-school girl in Colorado. It is deeper, wiser, more painful than her debut: devastating in its impact, and impossible to look away from. I can’t remember the last time I finished a thriller in tears, not even sure by that point who my heart was hurting for. Sarah VaughanSimon & Schuster, £14.99, pp480 Sarah Vaughan’s fifth novel is uncannily timely. Emma Webster, a Labour backbencher and single mother, is campaigning on the topic of revenge porn when her teenage daughter Flora runs into trouble of her own. As dark and gripping as you’d expect from the author of Anatomy of a Scandal. Tove Alsterdal, translated by Alice MenziesFaber, £14.99, pp368 The acclaimed Swedish author’s new novel opens 20 years after Olof Hagström left the remote community in the far north of Sweden where he grew up. He was arrested at the age of 14 for the rape and murder of Lina Stavred, and when he returns, he finds himself in the spotlight again. Alsterdal explores themes of culpability and memory as she lays out, sensitively and painfully, how a child suspect is failed by his family and the police.
