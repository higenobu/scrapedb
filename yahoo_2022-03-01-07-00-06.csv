3/1/2022,"A 17-mile-long convoy comprising hundreds of Russian military vehicles reached the outskirts of Kyiv on Monday, CNN reported. Per CNN, the convoy was originally identified on Sunday in satellite imagery provided by Maxar Technologies. At the time, it was approximately 40 miles from Kyiv. By around 11:00 a.m. on Monday, the convoy was positioned near Antonov air base, about 17 miles from the city center of Kyiv. Russian forces captured the air base on Friday after heavy fighting, BBC reported. A source described as a ""western official"" told CNN on Monday that Russia is ""well behind the schedule it set"" for the invasion. Kyiv has already outlasted the worst-case scenario U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley outlined before the invasion when he said the Ukrainian capital could fall within 72 hours. According to Ukrainian military sources, Russian reconnaissance forces made several attempts to push into Kyiv on Friday night but were repelled after vicious street fighting. Russian troops have also fired missiles into the Ukrainian capital. The main body of Russian troops pushing south from Belarus has not yet attacked the city, but the large number of tanks, artillery pieces, and other vehicles in the convoy could signal that a major assault is immanent. 7 scathing cartoons about Republicans' defense of Russia Conservatives pounce after Biden nominates Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court Watch: Ukrainian civilians use their bodies to block Russian tanks",World/The Week,17-mile-long Russian convoy reaches outskirts of Kyiv,https://news.yahoo.com/17-mile-long-russian-convoy-212654821.html
3/1/2022,"The search for a missing Arkansas man and his dog ended after crews found the two side-by-side in the woods, according to police. Timothy Reels, 62, of Spadra was found dead, the Johnson County Sheriff’s Office announced Monday, Feb. 28 — a week after the man was last reported seen. The sheriff’s office began searching for Reels on Feb. 27, after a missing person call came in early that morning, the office said in a statement. Deputies searched Reels’ home that day and found his truck and cell phone had been left behind. After speaking with “numerous people,” investigators learned he hadn’t been seen or heard from since Feb. 21. Missing along with him were his Honda 4-wheeler, and his pet pit bull, the sheriff’s office said. “A ground search was initiated” and local firefighters, and state search and rescue crews assisted the sheriff’s office, putting K9s, drones, boats and ATVs into use. They came upon Reels’ 4-wheeler “abandoned in the Spadra bottoms.” Crews found Reels the next morning at 9:30 a.m., the sheriff’s office said, a quarter of a mile from his Honda, dead but not alone. His dog was alive and still by his side, the sheriff’s office said. Though “foul play” has been ruled out, it’s not clear how Reels died or when. Or how long his dog kept watch over his body. “Deputies were able to safely capture the animal” and take them to a veterinarian for examination, the sheriff’s office said. “Investigators are still on scene. They will work in conjunction with the coroner’s office to determine time and cause of death.” Dog tries to save fisherman who plunged through ice into Utah lake, officials say Chihuahua escapes after ‘extremely bold’ predator snatches it from Texas backyard Dog home alone turns on stove sparking apartment fire in Kansas, firefighters say Dog missing for 24 hours found trapped in a sinkhole in Illinois.

3/1/2022,"By Tuvan Gumrukcu and Jonathan Spicer ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey's pledge to block some Russian warships from passing through its waters to the Black Sea during the Ukraine crisis could help repair its ties with NATO, even as it risks reprisals from Moscow. But a buildup of Russian ships waiting to make the journey will test Ankara's resolve over the next few days and show how far it is willing to go in tilting its uniquely delicate diplomatic balance between east and west. Turkey changed its rhetoric to call Moscow's assault on Ukraine a ""war"" on Sunday - a move that would allow Ankara to use parts of an international pact to limit the transit of some Russian warships from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea. That could curb Moscow's ability to build up its naval force attacking Ukraine's Black Sea Coast, though it all depends on the small print in the 1936 Montreux Convention. The pact allows Turkey to limit naval transit of its Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits during wartime but has a clause exempting ships returning to their registered base. At least four Russian ships are currently waiting on Turkey's decision to cross from the Mediterranean, Yoruk Isik, an Istanbul-based geopolitical analyst and head of the Bosphorus Observer consultancy, said. Two of them - a frigate and a destroyer - have formally asked to make the journey as soon as this week, according to Isik and a senior Turkish official. Any of them claiming the Black Sea as their base could still make the journey, leaving Turkey with some wriggle room. ""Calling it a 'war' is a very big step,"" Isik told Reuters. ""Ankara didn't want to take this step and, with the language, is giving Moscow one last chance to stem aggression in Ukrainian cities."" HIGH STAKES The stakes are high for NATO member Turkey which has maritime borders and good ties with both Russia and Ukraine A decided shift to the West could burnish its standing within NATO after Turkey's 2019 purchase of Russian S-400 missiles soured relations and triggered U.S. sanctions. Yet, any step too far may harm Turkey's already beleaguered economy after a currency crisis in December and an inflationary spiral. Russian natural gas accounts for 45% of Turkish imports, while Russians account for 20% of Turkey's tourists. Atilla Yesilada of GlobalSource Partners said Turkey's shift over the conflict was ""almost certain to draw the Russian wrath,"" and that this would be seen with bans on Turkish agricultural exports or provocations in Syria. A separate official with knowledge of the matter said Turkey's government planned to take steps to boost the economy now that fallout from the conflict is being felt ""more and more by the day"". The lira briefly tumbled 5% last week as the attacks - which Russia call a ""special operation"" - began. Meanwhile, Turkey's politicians have kept their own rhetoric measured. President Tayyip Erdogan has criticised the Western approach to Moscow including the use of sanctions, while also taking a sharp tone towards Russia, calling the invasion ""unacceptable"" and a ""heavy blow"" to regional security. While forging close ties with Russia on energy and defence, Ankara has sold drones to Ukraine and inked a deal to co-produce more, angering Moscow. Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu appealed to Russian and Ukrainian counterparts for a ceasefire and negotiations, which Erdogan has offered to host. Cavusoglu said on Sunday that ships returning to base in the Black Sea will be permitted passage and evaluated on a case-by-case basis. When it came to establishing the ships' all-important home station, he added: ""Everything should be transparent.""

3/1/2022,"ELKHART — A Jimtown High School teacher has requested early retirement, Baugo school officials say, after he was captured on video striking a student with enough force to cause visible injuries. Baugo officials said in a press release Friday that the teacher, Mike Hosinski, is no longer with Baugo Community Schools and is not allowed on school grounds. The incident, which occurred Friday morning, has been referred to the Indiana Department of Child Services and the Elkhart County Sheriff's Department, school officials said Friday. More on Baugo: Complaints prompt removal of political materials from class ""Any action that threatens to harm any student will be quickly, directly, and severely addressed,"" states a press release from Baugo schools. ""All Jimmies must be able to learn in a safe environment."" Baugo Community Schools' attorney released video of the Friday encounter upon a request from The Tribune. In the 44-second video, a student with a hood pulled up is seen entering the hallway with an adult following quickly behind. The adult jogs to catch up with the student, rounds a corner and is then seen using the student's backpack to force him into the wall. The adult wags his finger in the video, which does not include any sound. The adult then hits the student with such force the boy's head snaps back into the wall behind him. The boy falls to the ground after the adult places both of his hands on the student's shoulders in an attempt to direct him down the hallway. Multiple witnesses appear toward the end of the exchange, including a woman who checks on the boy as he lies on the floor. Baugo officials said the incident occurred after the teacher confronted the student about a hoodie he wore to class. The district's statement says a verbal exchange occurred in the hallway and ""inexplicably, the teacher struck the student in the face with an open-handed slap."" School officials say the student, who has not been identified publicly, suffered visible injuries and medial staff immediately provided treatment. ""The safety of students attending Baugo Community Schools is our highest priority and greatest responsibility,"" Baugo's Friday press release reads. ""When anyone, including a teacher, undermines that priority and responsibility, swift action must and will be taken to safeguard Jimtown students. Anything less cannot be tolerated."" In addition to contacting the Elkhart County Sheriff's Department and Department of Child Services, school officials say they reached out to licensing officials with the Indiana Department of Education. A DCS spokeswoman said in an email Monday that Indiana confidentiality laws prohibit the department from commenting on DCS involvement. The Tribune has left a message with the Elkhart County Sheriff's Department. A spokeswoman for the Elkhart County Prosecutor's office said Monday morning no charges have been filed at this time. Baugo school officials say they will fully cooperate with all investigations and will offer support services to the student involved. A letter to Baugo families Sunday clarified Hosinski's status with the school after district officials say incorrect facts were shared by local outlets and on social media. Hosinski was not fired by Baugo schools, district officials say, but rather requested an early retirement. Hosinski, a teacher for 40 years, requested in January to retire at the end of this school year, but submitted another request to leave immediately following Friday morning's incident, according to the district. The Baugo school board is expected to vote Monday evening on the teacher's accelerated retirement request. ""Standard procedure prohibits any Baugo Community School employee from being on school grounds while an investigation into possible criminal or civil misconduct is occurring,"" Baugo Superintendent Byron Sanders wrote in the letter Sunday. ""The investigations into Mr. Hosinski's actions remain ongoing. Consequently, until those investigations conclude, he is prohibited from being on school premises."" The Tribune could not immediately reach Hosinski for comment. The Tribune has left messages for the district's superintendent. This is not the first time Hosinski's conduct as a teacher has been called into question. In 2019, the Northern Indiana Atheists announced its intention to file a complaint with the Freedom from Religion Foundation over concerns the teacher promoted personal political views in his classroom. Photos obtained by the organization showed posters and stickers in a classroom with messages like ""Proud to be a conservative,"" ""Choose life, your mom did,"" and ""Liberalism is a mental disorder."" A parent also told Northern Indiana Atheists, Hosinski told students in his class ""Hillary and Obama are criminals, President Donald Trump is great, and Democrats are liars."" Some on social media are defending the longtime teacher. Posts on Facebook detailed plans of a student walkout Monday morning, and a Change.org petition entitled ""Save Mr. Mike Hosinski Tenure and Retirement"" had collected more than 1,200 signatures by noon Monday. Congratulations Mr. Hosinski: JHS Teacher of the Year. pic.twitter.com/3xKuvy0gyv — Jimtown High School (@JimtownHigh) May 7, 2020 Hosinski was named JHS Teacher of the Year in 2020, according to a Jimtown High School social media post.

3/1/2022,"NEW YORK (AP) — Former President Donald Trump has appealed a judge’s decision requiring he answer questions under oath in New York state’s civil investigation into his business practices — a widely expected move that's likely to prolong the fight over his testimony by months. Lawyers for Trump and his two eldest children filed papers on Monday with the appellate division of the state's trial court, seeking to overturn Manhattan Judge Arthur Engoron's Feb. 17 ruling. They argue ordering the Trumps to testify violates their constitutional rights because their answers could be used in a parallel criminal investigation. In an eight-page ruling, Engoron set a March 10 deadline for Trump and his children, Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr., to sit for depositions. Lawyers for the Trumps asked the appellate court for a stay to spare them from questioning while it considers the matter. The court did not set a date for arguments. It typically issues decisions several months after that, but could be inclined to rule on an expedited basis given the urgency of New York Attorney General Letitia James' investigation and the Trumps' desire to swiftly overturn Engoron’s ruling. A message seeking comment was left with James' office. In a statement on Friday, as lawyers for the Trumps were preparing their appeal, the attorney general signaled she was ready for a long fight to get them to testify. “Donald J. Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., and Ivanka Trump were ordered by the court to comply with our lawful investigation into Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization’s financial dealings,"" James said in the statement. ""While they have the right to seek a delay, they cannot deter us from following the facts and the law wherever they may lead. Make no mistake: My office will continue to pursue this case without fear or favor because no one is above the law.” Trump did not immediately comment on the appeal. In a statement following Engoron's decision, he called the ruling “a continuation of the greatest Witch Hunt in history."" “THERE IS NO CASE!” he said, claiming he's unable to get a fair hearing in New York “because of the hatred of me by Judges and the judiciary” and accusing James’ office of “doing everything within their corrupt discretion to interfere with my business relationships, and with the political process.” James, a Democrat, has said her investigation has uncovered evidence Trump’s company, the Trump Organization, used “fraudulent or misleading” valuations of assets like golf courses and skyscrapers to get loans and tax benefits. In his ruling, Engoron wrote: “A State Attorney General commences investigating a business entity, uncovers copious evidence of possible financial fraud, and wants to question, under oath, several of the entities’ principals, including its namesake. She has the clear right to do so.” If Engoron’s decision is upheld it could force Trump into a tough decision about whether to answer questions, or stay silent, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Anything Trump says in a civil deposition could be used against him in the criminal probe being overseen by the Manhattan district attorney’s office. At a hearing prior to Engoron’s decision, Trump’s lawyers argued that having him sit for a civil deposition is an improper attempt to get around a state law barring prosecutors from calling someone to testify before a criminal grand jury without giving them immunity. A lawyer for the attorney general’s office told Engoron that it wasn’t unusual to have civil and criminal investigations proceeding at the same time, and Engoron rejected a request from lawyers for the Trumps to pause the civil probe until the criminal matter is over. Last summer, spurred by evidence uncovered in James’ civil investigation, the Manhattan district attorney’s office charged Weisselberg and the Trump Organization with tax fraud, alleging he collected more than $1.7 million in off-the-books compensation. Weisselberg and the company have pleaded not guilty. The future of the criminal probe was thrown into question last week when the two prosecutors leading it abruptly quit. Lawyers for the Trumps asked the appellate court Monday to consider three questions: — whether James' office is violating their rights by issuing subpoenas for their testimony while also participating in the criminal investigation; — whether protections for grand jury witnesses under state law, such as immunity, can be “eviscerated, if the same agency involved in the criminal investigation simply opens a ‘civil’ investigation into the very same matters”; — and whether Engoron erred in rejecting the Trumps' contention that James has engaged in selective prosecution. Engoron, in his ruling, said the thousands of pages of evidence he’s reviewed in the case shows there’s sufficient basis for continuing the investigation and undercuts “the notion that this ongoing investigation is based on personal animus, not facts and law.” ___ Follow Michael Sisak on Twitter at twitter.com/mikesisak  and send confidential tips by visiting https://www.ap.org/tips/",U.S./Associated Press,Trump appeals ruling forcing him to testify in NY probe,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-appeals-ruling-forcing-him-214019622.html
