Fumiko Yamada, of Naka, Ibaraki Prefecture, suffocated her 46-year-old daughter, Megumi, by wrapping cellophane over her face and strangling her with a rope while she was sleeping on the morning of April 13.

Yamada, identified by some reports as Ayako Yamada, then rode her bicycle to the police station and turned herself in at around 2 a.m.

“I'm tired of taking care of her. I killed my daughter,” she reportedly told the police.
