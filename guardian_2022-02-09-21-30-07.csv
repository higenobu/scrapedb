2/9/2022,"The descendants of Italy’s last king are suing the Italian state in their fight to reclaim the crown jewels, which for almost 76 years have been stashed in a treasure chest in a safety deposit box at the Bank of Italy amid a long-running mystery over their ownership. The legal action comes after the offspring of King Umberto II failed to reach an agreement with the bank to return the jewels, which comprise of more than 6,000 diamonds and 2,000 pearls mounted on brooches, necklaces and tiaras worn by various princesses and queens during the monarchy’s 85-year existence.  The first hearing will take place on 7 June at the court of Rome, said Sergio Orlandi, the lawyer representing Umberto II’s son, Vittorio Emanuele di Savoia, and three daughters, Maria Gabriella, Maria Pia and Maria Beatrice. “We knew the mediation meeting [with the Bank of Italy] wouldn’t go anywhere but were obliged to have it before [suing the state],” added Orlandi. “I hope we manage to get the jewels returned, and it will now be up to a judge to establish if the family has the [ownership] rights.” The Bank of Italy took delivery of the jewels on 5 June 1946, three days after Italians voted to abolish the monarchy and nine days before Umberto II, who ruled for just 34 days, was banished into exile along with his male heirs. Umberto II had asked Falcone Lucifero, the minister of the Royal House, to bring the jewels to Luigi Einaudi, the then governor of Bank of Italy who later became president, for safekeeping. The jewels are said to have been the only part of the royal estate that were not confiscated by the Italian state after the monarchy was scrapped, an element that might help the Savoia family win back possession. They also hope that a cryptic note delivered alongside the treasure chest, which said the “precious” crown jewels must be “entrusted to the custody of the central cashier” and “kept at the disposal of those who have right”, will help determine that the jewels belong to them and not the state.",News/World news,Offspring of Italy’s last king sue state in battle to reclaim crown jewels,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/09/king-umberto-ii-italy-offspring-sue-state-battle-reclaim-crown-jewels
2/9/2022,"Boris Johnson plans to abolish the last Covid restrictions in England, including the requirement for people with the virus to self-isolate, in less than two weeks, a month earlier than initially proposed, he has announced. In an opening statement to prime minister’s questions, Johnson said he hoped to do this as soon as the Commons returns from its upcoming recess, on 21 February.  “I can tell the house today that it is my intention to return on the first day after the half-term recess to present our strategy for living with Covid,” he said. “Provided the current encouraging trends in the data continue, it is my expectation that we will be able to end the last domestic restrictions, including the legal requirement to self-isolate if you test positive, a full month early.” The plans to end all restrictions was announced by Johnson last month, when he unveiled the scrapping of so-called plan B measures such as mask use. Johnson told the Commons that the legal requirement on people with coronavirus to self-isolate would be allowed to lapse when the regulations expired on 24 March, and that date could be brought forward. The legal requirement to self-isolate, carrying fines of up to £10,000 for non-compliance, is one of several pieces of Covid legislation due to expire in March. Other provisions that will run out or require renewal include giving your address to NHS test and trace and listing members of your household.",News/World news,Boris Johnson says he plans to lift all England’s Covid rules a month early,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/09/boris-johnson-says-he-plans-to-lift-all-englands-covid-rules-a-month-early
2/9/2022,"An initial investigation into allegations that Israeli police targeted citizens with spyware has confirmed that the application was indeed used against three people, according to claims by a local news station. The Israeli broadcaster Channel 12 said a police investigation ordered by Israel’s public security minister, Omer Barlev, had concluded that of 26 individuals named in recent reports as having been targeted using NSO Group’s Pegasus software, three named individuals were targeted, with the police successfully hacking only one of the phones.  Channel 12 did not name the three people and the Guardian has not been able to independently verify the report. The disclosure comes amid reports that officers from the intelligence agencies Shin Bet and Mossad would be involved in the investigation. Channel 12 claimed in its report that the initial inquiry suggested that in all three cases a court had approved the interception of individuals’ phones. The report leaves numerous questions unanswered, including whether Pegasus was the only application of its kind available to the Israeli police’s cyber-intelligence unit, and whether others than those named in recent reports were targeted. Barlev ordered the initial investigation at the behest of the Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, pending a decision on what shape any further commission of inquiry should take. “Before a decision is made on the mechanism for investigating the affair, the prime minister requested to conduct a [further] probe of the 26 names mentioned in the Calcalist newspaper’s report,” a statement from Bennett’s office said, referring to the media outlet that initially reported the use of the spyware. Calcalist reported on Monday that the spyware was deployed without court authorisation against senior government officials, mayors, activist leaders, journalists, and the former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s family members and advisers, naming two dozen targets. Bennett said this week: “This tool [Pegasus] and similar tools are important tools in the fight against terrorism and severe crime. But they were not intended to be used in fishing campaigns targeting the Israeli public or officials, which is why we need to understand exactly what happened.” The investigation into alleged police use of Pegasus is the latest controversy to hit NSO Group’s spyware. The Pegasus project – by a global consortium of media organisations, of which the Guardian is a partner – has alleged that the spyware, licensed by Israel, has been used against activists, journalists, political opponents and human rights defenders in a number of countries. NSO says all of its sales are government-authorised and that it does not itself run Pegasus. The controversy has prompted a wider debate about all kinds of surveillance of Israeli citizens by the state. It has also fed into the drama surrounding Netanyahu’s corruption trial, with the former prime minister seizing on reports that police illicitly tapped the phones of key witnesses. On Tuesday a Jerusalem court accepted a request to cancel a hearing in order to provide more time for prosecution lawyers to seek more information on the claims.",News/World news,"Inquiry finds Israeli police used spyware against three people, report says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/09/inquiry-finds-israeli-police-used-spyware-against-three-people-report-says
2/9/2022,"Antonio Conte could make a move for Christian Eriksen in the summer after admitting he was surprised to see the Denmark midfielder back in the Premier League with Brentford. The Tottenham manager, who worked with Eriksen at Internazionale – they won the Serie A title together last season – thought the player might need more time to recover from the cardiac arrest he suffered last June. Eriksen collapsed in Denmark’s opening Euro 2020 finals game against Finland and needed life-saving treatment on the pitch.  Conte, who is living in a London hotel – his wife and daughter have remained in Italy – enjoyed a chance encounter with Eriksen on Sunday. Eriksen is staying at the same hotel after agreeing a deal with Brentford until the end of the season. Conte said he had not discussed signing Eriksen as a free agent in January with the Spurs board, mainly because he did not imagine the former club favourite would be ready to play again in England. He will monitor his progress closely over the final months of the season. Eriksen has been fitted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, which meant that Inter had to release him because the rules in Italy do not allow players with such a device to compete. He has not played since the trauma of the Finland game and is working on his fitness for what will be an emotional return with Brentford. “Honestly, no,” Conte said, when asked whether there had been a discussion about bringing Eriksen back to Spurs. “Honestly, I was surprised about the situation because in my mind, honestly, I thought Christian needed more time before coming back to play in England. “For sure, Eriksen is part of Tottenham’s story. To come back here would be a good opportunity for him, for me, for the club. Now he’s signed for Brentford … only six months, and we’ll see what happens. “I was lucky because I met him on Sunday and it was good to speak with him. I saw him with his family and it was good. I met him in the same hotel that we were both staying in. We didn’t prepare the meeting. It was only a coincidence to see him and his family. “I’m the first person to be happy to see him again on the pitch because we spent a really good time at Inter Milan together. We won the league, we spent two important seasons together. I wish him all the best for the future. And you don’t know what will happen. It would be good for me to have him again, to work together.”",Sport/Football,Conte reveals Spurs could move for Eriksen if Brentford spell a success,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/09/antonio-conte-spurs-could-move-for-christian-eriksen-if-brentford-a-success
2/9/2022,"This American classic is a zingy, yellow act of rebellion against stodgy, beige, winter puddings. A celebration of seasonal citrus topped with a snowy cloud of meringue, it’s also a true showstopper: the culinary equivalent of another Southern blonde bombshell, Miss Dolly Parton – altogether too much, and all the more irresistible for it. Serve à la mode with a scoop of ice-cream for maximum pleasure. Prep 40 minChill/rest 1 hrCook 30 minServes 6  For the pastry225g plain flour2 tbsp caster sugar½ tsp salt120g cold butter1 egg yolk2 tbsp cold water3 digestive biscuits For the filling6 lemons, at least 3 of them unwaxed for preference25g cornflour175g caster sugar3 egg yolks25g butter For the meringue4 egg whites1 pinch of salt225g caster sugar2 tsp cornflour Start with the pastry. LMP requires a sturdy, rich shortcrust, which you’ll need to make yourself (you could use a ready-made sweet shortcrust, if you prefer, but this is much nicer). Mix the flour, sugar and salt in a large bowl, grate in the butter, then rub it in using your fingertips. Alternatively, pulse everything in a food processor to coarse crumbs. Add the egg yolk and just enough of the cold water (you shouldn’t need it all) that it comes together into a soft, but not sticky dough that you’re able to shape into a coherent ball – too much water will cause the pastry to shrink in the oven, while too little will mean it’ll disintegrate under the rolling pin, so add it gradually. Flatten the pastry ball, then wrap and chill for 30 minutes (if you need to leave it in the fridge for longer, get it out a little while before you want to roll it out). Meanwhile, grease a 20-22cm loose-bottomed tart tin, and crush the digestives to crumbs (putting them in a bag and whacking them with a rolling pin is a fun way to do this). Scatter half the biscuit crumbs on a work surface, then lay the pastry on top and roll out to about 5mm thick. Scatter the remaining crumbs on top, then use the pastry to line the tin, trimming it neatly, so there’s still just a little standing proud of the sides. Chill for another 30 minutes. Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Prick the base all over with a fork, then line the tin with greaseproof paper and baking beans or similar (dried beans, rice, etc) and bake for 20 minutes. Carefully lift out the beans and paper, bake the base for another five to seven minutes, until the pastry is dry and pale golden, then remove and leave to cool. Zest three of the lemons (if they’re waxed, scrub the skin well with hot water first), then juice all six of them: you should end up with about 200ml. Put both the zest and the juice in a saucepan. Whisk 50ml water into the cornflour until smooth, then whisk this into the pan. Stir in the sugar and egg yolks. Dice the butter and put it near the hob. Put the pan on a low flame and heat gently, stirring, until the mix is warm. Still stirring, add the butter, then slowly bring the mixture up to a simmer. Once the lemon thickens and reaches the consistency of thick custard, spoon it into the tart case and set aside to cool completely (it will continue to firm up as it cools). Heat the oven back up to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. In a large clean bowl, or in a food mixer, whisk the egg whites and a pinch of salt to soft peaks. Whisk in the sugar a spoonful at a time, then carry on whisking until the meringue mix is stiff and shiny. Finally, whisk in the cornflour. Spoon the meringue on top of the pie, artistically shaping it into snowy peaks. Bake for about 15 minutes, until the meringue is lightly golden on top. Leave to cool before serving. The soft meringue means that this is not a dessert that keeps particularly well, but cover any leftovers loosely with foil and refrigerate.

2/9/2022,"The prospect of harnessing the power of the stars has moved a step closer to reality after scientists set a new record for the amount of energy released in a sustained fusion reaction. Researchers at the Joint European Torus (JET), a fusion experiment in Oxfordshire, generated 59 megajoules of heat – equivalent to about 14kg of TNT – during a five-second burst of fusion, more than doubling the previous record of 21.7 megajoules set in 1997 by the same facility.  The feat announced on Wednesday follows more than two decades of tests and refinements at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy and has been hailed as a “major milestone” on the road to fusion becoming a viable and sustainable low-carbon energy source. “These landmark results have taken us a huge step closer to conquering one of the biggest scientific and engineering challenges of them all,” said Prof Ian Chapman, the chief executive of the UK Atomic Energy Authority. “It’s clear we must make significant changes to address the effects of climate change, and fusion offers so much potential.” The doughnut-shaped JET is built to contain plasmas, or highly ionised gases, which are heated to 150m degrees Celsius, 10 times hotter than the centre of the sun. At such extreme temperatures, atomic nuclei can fuse together to form new elements and release vast amounts of energy. The same fusion reactions power the sun, but at considerably lower temperatures, because stars have gravity to lend a hand. Experiments at JET have focused on whether fusion is feasible with a fuel based on two isotopes of hydrogen known as deuterium and tritium which combine to form helium gas. The latest results suggest that it is and provide crucial confirmation for Iter, a larger fusion project being built in the south of France. Iter is scheduled to start burning deuterium-tritium fuel in 2035 and ultimately generate more heat than is needed to keep its plasma at high temperature. If all goes well with Iter, the next step is to build a European demonstration power plant that produces more electricity than it uses and is hooked up to the grid. The prospect of fusion energy is deeply attractive because it does not release greenhouse gases and 1kg of fusion fuel contains about 10m times as much energy as 1kg of coal, oil or gas. While deuterium is abundantly available in sea water, tritium is extremely rare and produced in nuclear reactors. Future fusion plants – Iter included – are expected to make their own tritium fuel by using high-energy neutrons, released when deuterium and tritium fuse, to split the common metal lithium into tritium and helium. Dr Mark Wenman, a reader in nuclear materials at Imperial College London, said that while the experiment released fusion energy for only five seconds, it proved that the fuel could be burned in a sustainable manner. “It’s been a while since they have produced a record like this and it’s a major milestone on the way to proving that fusion’s a viable and sustainable energy source for the future. “Five seconds doesn’t sound like much, but if you can burn it for five seconds, presumably you could keep it stable and keep it burning for many minutes, hours, or days, which is what you are going to need for a proper fusion power plant. It’s the proof of that concept that they have achieved,” he said. Prof Ian Fells, the emeritus professor of energy conversion at the University of Newcastle, said the record-breaking release of fusion energy was “a landmark” in fusion research. “Now it is up to the engineers to translate this into carbon-free electricity and mitigate the problem of climate change,” he added.",News/Environment,Nuclear fusion heat record a ‘huge step’ in quest for new energy source,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/09/nuclear-fusion-heat-record-a-huge-step-in-quest-for-new-energy-source
2/9/2022,"Today in a nutshell: It was a tough day at the office for favourites Mikaela Shiffrin and Charlotte Bankes, but the redemption of Lindsey Jacobellis is a tale for the ages Next up: The opening men’s curling matches and the luge doubles, and then tomorrow we get the chance to watch Nathan Chen going for gold, while the US men start their ice hockey campaign  Petra Vlhova set the pace early in the women’s slalom, and then had to watch a series of world-class skiers come down the hill and just fail to pip her time, giving her Slovakia’s first ever Alpine skiing gold. Katharina Liensberger took silver for Austria. Switzerland’s Wendy Holdener was third. Swede Sara Hector had looked set to win a second gold in three days, but the newly-crowned giant slalom champion fell with the finish line in sight and an advantage over Vlhova of almost half a second. Yet perhaps the defining image of the event was US star Mikaela Shiffrin sitting in the snow with her head bowed in disbelief for several minutes after she was disqualified after missing a gate early in first run. After crashing out of her last event, her dream of a record medal haul is rapidly becoming a nightmare and afterwards she said she might not continue to compete in these Games. It was a very different story for Lindsey Jacobellis, who won the first US gold of Beijing in the women’s snowboardcross final. It was redemption for the 36-year-old, who missed out on gold in the 2006 Turin Games with a late fall while in the lead after she attempted a showboating jump trick while well clear of eventual winner Tanja Frieden. After today’s victory, Jacobellis said: “They can keep talking about the 2006 Games all they want because it really shaped me into the individual that I am and kept me hungry and really helped me keep fighting in the sport.” Chloe Trespeuch of France took the silver, while the bronze went to Meryeta O’Dine of Canada. Charlotte Bankes was Britain’s biggest medal hope of these Games, but the 2021 world champion failed to progress beyond the quarter-finals. “I can’t explain,” she said after finishing third. A dominant 108m jump by Japan’s Ryota Yamamoto meant he went into the cross-country leg of the Nordic combined normal hill/10km in front, but he couldn’t live with the pace of the leading group. Vinzenz Geiger of Germany took gold, 0.8 seconds ahead of Norway’s Joergen Graabak. Natalie Geisenberger won an incredible third consecutive gold in the women’s single luge late yesterday, saying victory this time – her first event since becoming a mother – was different. “I think it was a pretty hard way because my son is absolutely my number one, and my training was around my child,” she said. “But that I’m now here with another gold medal is just amazing.” Geisenberger’s compatriot Anna Berreiter took the silver. The medal ceremony for the team figure skating competition has been delayed because of an ongoing legal issue that could affect medalists, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said. The athletes of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) had been placed first, with the US second and Japan third. Canada finished in fourth. Several of the ROC skaters, including star Kamila Valieva, did not appear at practice sessions today. No reason was given. One of the journalists who conducted the first independent sit-down interview with Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai says the carefully controlled conversation did not answer questions about whether she can speak her mind or move freely. However, the IOC president Thomas Bach, who watched the freestyle skiing with her as his guest yesterday, said: “We answered the question, ‘Where is Peng Shuai?’. You could see it in her appearances that she is enjoying the Games, enjoying being among athletes and the public and this is why we are continuing to have this contact. I hope I will meet her again in the summer in Lausanne.” Sweden took a one-two in the women’s cross-country sprint free event yesterday, with Jonna Sundling finishing nearly three seconds ahead of Maja Dahlqvist. Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo of Norway won the men’s event by a much tighter margin over Italy’s Federico Pellegrino, who was just 0.26 seconds shy of gold. Eileen Gu soars to Olympic gold as China embraces dual-culture star China to boost supply of Olympic panda mascots amid shortages Ledecka’s snowboard gold keeps her on course for double-double Norway’s Birk Ruud claimed the first ever men’s freeski big air Olympic gold. Having landed a switch left triple 1980 mute – that is five and a half rotations – in the first run, the 21-year-old scored a total of 187.75 and was assured of the title before the third and final jump, which he made holding the Norwegian flag.

2/9/2022,"Imports of UK goods into Germany fell 8.5% last year, in the latest signal that extra costs and red tape related to Brexit are damaging British trading relationships. Britain also fell out of the top five of Germany’s largest trade partners as the EU’s biggest economy turned to its neighbours inside the eurozone for machine tools, car parts and components for the aerospace industry.  The German statistical office, Destatis, said UK imports fell in 2021, the first year since the Brexit free trade deal was agreed in late December 2020, to €32bn (£27bn). However, the situation improved for many of Germany’s other trading partners, which enjoyed a big rise in sales to Germany. Total goods imports into Germany surged by 17.1% during the year to €1.2tn, in part due to the extra costs of imported energy, but also after the easing of lockdown restrictions and as vaccine rollouts spurred the global economic recovery last year. The increase included a 16.8% rise in imports from Germany’s fellow European Union members, and a 20.8% rise in imports from China. In December alone, German imports from the UK were down 18.2% year on year, which analysts said was due to a rush of stockpiling in December 2020 as firms prepared for possible Brexit disruption. The EU introduced checks on goods from Britain entering the bloc as soon as the Brexit deal came into effect, with experts warning that UK firms were losing their competitiveness. The value of German goods arriving in Britain has also fallen. The UK delayed its checks on goods coming in until 2022. But even so, German exports to the UK fell by 2.6% during 2021, to €65.4bn. Overall, German exports rose by 14% in the year, even as the pandemic continued to cause disruption to global supply chains. Destatis said: “Compared with the same month last year, exports to the UK dropped by 7.6% to €5bn in December 2021. Imports from the UK were down 18.2% to €2.6bn.” Carsten Brzeski, the global head of macroeconomics at ING, said the trade data showed that Brexit had left its mark on German trade. He said: “Looking at export destinations, 2021 clearly marks a structural shift, illustrating current themes including reshoring, slowing of Chinese growth and different ways to deal with the pandemic. “Brexit has left its mark on German trade as the UK dropped out of the five most important trading partners list, with German companies exporting more to Austria than to the UK. “In the run-up to the Brexit deal signed in December 2020 many supporters of the vote to quit the EU single market and customs union said the importance of the UK as a trading partner for Berlin would override new trade frictions.” In 2020, figures from the World Bank showed £49bn of goods were exported to Germany, making Germany the UK’s second largest export market for goods after the US. For imports of goods, Germany was the largest trading partner with £66.1bn of goods being imported in 2020, according to the ONS. A report by parliament’s financial watchdog on Wednesday urged ministers to secure further agreements with the EU to ease trade across the channel. The public accounts committee said fresh EU regulations were likely to hit trade when they come into force in September unless the infrastructure at ports is improved.",News/World news,UK goods into Germany down 8.5% in further sign of Brexit damage,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/09/uk-goods-into-germany-down-further-sign-brexit-damage
2/9/2022,"The Thames could get its first designated bathing site for wild swimming, the government has announced. This would be the second river designated for swimming in England. Members of the public have been invited to give their views on the possible designation of Wolvercote Mill Stream at Port Meadow, Oxford, and another bathing site on the Isle of Wight coast.  If accepted, the water quality would be monitored for bathers, with improvements being ordered by ministers if minimum standards were not met. Sewage Free Thames, the group that applied for the bathing spot in Oxford, said: “We love our rivers: they’re part of our daily lives, and we all walk, play, socialise, swim, paddle, row or fish on or around them. They give us many benefits, and they’re home to numerous other species. “However, our local rivers are in a poor state. In 2020, raw sewage was released into the upper Thames for nearly 50,000 hours. We want to make dumping raw sewage in rivers illegal, and our rivers safe and healthy for people and wildlife again. “We are applying for bathing water status for a stretch of the River Thames through Oxford. This will prevent sewage spills and improve water quality.” The stretch of river is popular with swimmers and paddle-boarders, but there are fears the water quality is poor. Local volunteers monitor the river for sewage spills, but Thames Water has promised to give real-time overflow updates in the near future. The environment minister Rebecca Pow said: “Bathing waters in England are a success story, with almost 95% achieving ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ status last year – the highest since new standards were introduced in 2015. We protect people’s health at popular swimming spots across the country by requiring the water quality at those sites to be regularly monitored and improvements made if they don’t meet the minimum standard. “It is great to see people getting involved in efforts to increase the number of designated bathing sites and I encourage local residents and swimmers to take part in these consultations so we can have as many views as possible to inform our final decision.” Thames Water has been asked for comment. Last year, the River Wharfe in the West Yorkshire town of Ilkley became the first river in England to be given bathing status. Campaigners hoped this would pressure local government and the water company to keep the stretch sewage-free, and clean it up. However, the river’s water was deemed poor quality by the Environment Agency after discharges from sewage overflows. Yorkshire Water said at the time it had committed to achieving a designation of “good” for the popular swimming area.",News/Environment,River Thames could get first designated wild swimming site,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/09/river-thames-could-get-first-designated-wild-swimming-site
2/9/2022,"Shakespeare gives a variety of psychological and theological reasons for young Hamlet’s inability to avenge his uncle’s murder of his father. Freddie Fox’s portrayal adds the possibility that the prince’s hands might shake too much to stab straight. This is not due to any lack of confidence in an emotionally wrenching and vocally ranging portrayal but because this student prince is, fascinatingly, a full-on alcoholic. Returning from Wittenberg uni draining a big whisky bottle, he understandably gags on his mother’s swift-wedding champagne but soon swigs down gin, entirely justifying the playing of Hamlet’s “till then sit still, my soul” as an attempt to settle delirium tremens. He visibly fears that the visitation from his father’s ghost may be his own consumption of spirits speaking. Attempting white-knuckle self-rehab while seeking revenge adds another layer to the usual complication of whether Hamlet’s “antic disposition” is acted or involuntary.  This narrative refreshment is served in the atmospheric setting of Guildford’s Holy Trinity Church, with the stage a raised platform in the chancel, and characters entering through rood screen and nave. Tom Littler, the most enterprising Shakespearean director outside the big venues, mines every site specificity. The sad songs of Rosalind Ford’s dignified Ophelia are, unusually, set to Bach. Stefan Bednarczyk’s Polonius is plausibly a bishop of the Danish church, with the actor impressively multiskilling by playing the organ live. During a “manic” episode, Fox nicks the adviser’s mitre and stole for some comic business in the pulpit, including a perfect impersonation of the coffin-lowering motor in a crematorium. The surrounds underline the play’s integral Christianity – Hamlet cannot kill himself or Claudius for avowedly doctrinal reasons – but also add darkness as the space is taken over by the graves and skulls that, in religious terms, churches pledge to transcend.
