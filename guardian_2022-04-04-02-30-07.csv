4/4/2022,"Judging the mood of live audiences is not a science, let alone an exact one. Every performance is different. This makes it tricky to assert with confidence that there is a special atmosphere in theatres at the moment. And yet the fact of long absence from auditoriums inevitably adds an extra charge to the experience of being back in them. This applies to actors, dancers, singers, musicians, front-of-house and backstage staff as well as ticket-holders. After two years during which so much of life was lived through screens, or via headphones, sharing an artistic experience with a group of other people in the same physical space feels more intense. Standing ovations were becoming more common anyway, as audiences realised that there is more fun to be had from getting up and cheering than clapping politely. Last June, audiences at London’s Coliseum were so delighted by Marisha Wallace in Hairspray that they rose to their feet and applauded one of her solo numbers halfway through the show. But now there is an additional incentive for such outpourings: the wish to show appreciation not just for what has just taken place on stage, but for the effort involved in stewarding theatres through the pandemic. From the Bush in west London, celebrating its 50th anniversary with a sold-out run of Tyrell Williams’s new three-hander, Red Pitch, to the many opera houses and concert halls where orchestras have played the Ukrainian national anthem over recent weeks, there is a palpably heightened sense of occasion. This is not to deny or minimise the toll that Covid has taken on many arts organisations. Northern Ballet’s Pinocchio opened at Hartlepool’s Town Hall Theatre over the weekend amid warnings about the venue’s long-term future. Last year, the orchestra for the West End production of Phantom of the Opera was cut from 27 musicians to just 14 – with missing instruments replaced by keyboard effects. For freelance artists who did not qualify for government support, the past couple of years have been punishing. But the worst fears when buildings closed their doors have not been realised. Audiences are returning, with full houses for first nights in regional theatres as well as the West End. Streaming services may have reaped the rewards of lockdowns, when home entertainment was the only option, but they have not replaced the visceral draw of live action. The prospect of watching performers act, sing or dance in the flesh can still lure people away from their screens. Some theatres are playing safe, putting on revivals rather than new plays, while a parade of A-list stars will boost receipts. Paul Bettany, Jessie Buckley, Eddie Redmayne and Kit Harington have all been on London stages this year, with Amy Adams and Jodie Comer to follow. But new talent is also on show. The choir in Maria Friedman’s hugely enjoyable Legacy features students from the Royal Academy of Music as well as her son. The pandemic reduced the opportunities for real-life interactions of all kinds. The buzz that surrounds theatres is a heartening reminder that there is nothing, to borrow a phrase from Lin-Manuel Miranda, like being “in the room where it happens”.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the power of live performance: all together now | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/03/the-guardian-view-on-the-power-of-live-performance-all-together-now
4/4/2022,"Passengers faced long queues at Heathrow and Manchester airports as the Easter holidays got under way. Travellers vented frustration on social media as Covid checks, high passenger volumes and reported staff shortages and e-gate problems meant long waits for check-in at Heathrow. The airport confirmed “some congestion” was affecting Terminal 2. In a statement, a spokesperson said: “Due to high passenger volumes and the Covid documentation checks still required by many end destinations, Terminal 2 departures has experienced some congestion today. “Our teams are supporting our airline partners to get passengers away on their journeys as quickly as possible and we apologise for any inconvenience this has caused.” At Manchester airport, which has struggled to cope with delays in recent weeks, a spokesperson apologised to passengers, saying: “As we recover from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, our whole industry is facing staff shortages and recruitment challenges. As a result we are advising customers that security queues may be longer than usual, and we encourage them to arrive at the earliest time recommended by their airline. “We are exploring a number of short-term measures to deliver the best possible service we can, such as the use of agency staff and different ways in which existing colleagues can support our operation”. Tourist traffic near the port of Dover was “free-flowing” again on Sunday after gridlocked roads on Saturday affected ferry users, with some drivers stuck in nine-hour queues. The suspension of P&O services, with three of the company’s vessels at berth in Dover, had been partly blamed for the long queues. Adverse weather in the Channel and congestion in Kent caused by the Easter getaway was also said to have contributed to the traffic jams. Drivers had on Saturday been forced to wait for hours to board ferries after measures were triggered to control the movement of HGVs in the area. Under Operation Brock, lorries heading to Dover are allowed to use one side of the M20 while all other traffic is restricted to a contraflow system on the opposite side. National Highways said the M20 remained closed with the operation still in place on Sunday “due to ongoing reduced ferry capacity at the port”. The cross-Channel situation was dealt a further blow when a DFDS ferry, Dover Seaways, hit a berth in high winds on Thursday. DFDS said in a statement the vessel was being inspected ahead of repairs and was expected to return to service on Monday or Tuesday. Richard Ballantyne, the head of the British Ports Association, said on Sunday the situation had improved, but that delays are likely to continue beyond the weekend. He told BBC Breakfast on Sunday: “East Kent and the Kent police services … and the very well-established operations team at the Port of Dover are predicting this is going to continue for another couple of days, but it is something we just quite don’t know how long it’s going to go on for.”    ",News/UK news,UK travellers face disruption as Easter holiday getaway begins,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/03/uk-travellers-face-disruption-as-easter-holiday-getaway-begins
4/4/2022,"My twin brother, Robert Ashe, who has died aged 69 of pancreatic cancer just five weeks after diagnosis, spent most of his working life supporting refugees in south-east Asia, including on the Thailand-Cambodia border, where he helped people to flee Cambodia’s murderous Khmer Rouge regime in the late 1970s. He also he set up what became known as the Landbridge project, taking food, seeds and agricultural tools into Cambodia in the wake of the Khmer Rouge’s overthrow. Born in London, one of the seven children of Patrick, a vicar, and Marion (nee Johnston), a nurse, Robert attended Christ’s Hospital school in Horsham, West Sussex, before going on to the Royal Agricultural College in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, and beginning a brief career in farming. In 1973, however, he joined Project Vietnam Orphans, a charity founded by his parents, to work with orphaned and abandoned children in Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) in Vietnam. It was from there that he became involved in his work on the Thai-Cambodian border which earned him the Thai Red Cross Medal of Merit in 1979, appointment as MBE in 1980 and a three-day spell in prison when he was arrested by suspicious Vietnamese soldiers unaware of his humanitarian work. Robert’s creation of the Landbridge project gained him the admiration of many – including Martin Griffiths, now UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief, who was working with Unicef in Thailand in 1979. “We all relied on Robert, and admired him,” Griffiths recalled. “It was a brilliant idea, but it needed great discipline to make it work – and Robert’s character, quiet and unassuming, was steely enough to do the job.” While in Thailand Robert met Var Hong, who, after the murder of her husband by the Khmer Rouge, had escaped Cambodia with her two young daughters, Somaly and Panita. Robert and Var married in 1982 and their son, Peter, was born. Also in 1982 Robert began working for Food for the Hungry International as their field director in Thailand. He was to spend the rest of his working life with UNHCR, where he held senior posts in Sudan, Geneva, The Hague and finally in Indonesia, where he was UNHCR’s regional representative covering Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Timor-Leste. Based in Jakarta, he was well placed to support communities after the disastrous tsunami of 2004. Robert’s marriage to Var ended in 1991, and in 2002 he married Aam Dachlan, who had two children, Joel and Julia, from a previous marriage. In 2010 they retired to Lombok, Indonesia, where Robert died. He is survived by Aam, Peter and grandson Dylan.",News/World news,Robert Ashe obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/03/robert-ashe-obituary
4/4/2022,"Traditionally a time for bonnets, bunnies and a surfeit of chocolate, Easter has increasingly taken on a new aspect, and more so since the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions. Easter crackers, Easter wreaths, and Easter trees are now critical components in the commercialisation of the Christian festival, with the bank holiday beginning to look a lot like Christmas. Lifestyle magazines are groaning with glossy images of wreath-adorned front doors, while pastel-coloured crackers and rabbit-emblazoned napkins nestle among wine glasses and gleaming cutlery on stylish dining tables. With pandemic lockdowns and restrictions having disrupted family get-togethers for the past two years, the appetite for Easter decor in 2022 is greater than ever, it seems. Many retailers’ websites are already out of stock of Easter cracker kits – the equivalent of the Christmas cracker but often featuring an abundance of bunnies and floral illustrations. Consumers are invited to “fill your own” with chocolate treats, while others contain fluffy, yellow miniature toy chicks. The supermarket retailers Aldi, Tesco and Sainsbury’s all appeared to have sold out of cracker kits online on Sunday. According to research by the retail analysts Mintel, Easter was estimated to be worth £550m to UK retailers in 2016, and the figure has since grown. In 2021, almost one in 20 Britons brought home decorations for Easter, rising to one in 10 between the ages of 25 and 40. This year, with social distancing rules no longer imposed, retailers hope householders will be pushing the boat out even more on lavish decorations. Eggs are no longer just made of chocolate, but are painted, beaded with Fabergé-inspired designs, and set to sparkle from special Easter twig trees. At John Lewis, sales of Easter trees are reportedly up 65%. Popular wreaths feature artificial flowers, eggs and twigs, while others incorporate lights and candles. Hobbycraft, whose Easter range includes fillable eggs and jute bunny gift bags, offers in-store workshops on creating the perfect wreath and bonnet. Sales of its Easter chocolate egg moulds have grown by 100% on last year, while searches for its Easter tree centrepieces increased by 45% in March 2022 compared with the previous month. Katherine Paterson, the customer development director at Hobbycraft, said there was also a significant move towards sustainability, with blank mache, wooden and ceramic Easter decorations proving popular. Searches for its mache cracked eggs and hanging ceramic baskets had increased by 300% and 122% respectively in 2022 compared with last year. “We have seen a huge increase in the demand for decorations that can be reused every year as customers are becoming increasingly aware of waste and are looking for ways to reduce waste and find alternative, plastic-free solutions,” she said. Lisa Cherry, seasonal buyer at John Lewis, told the Mail on Sunday: “Customers are looking to create their biggest ever Easter celebrations this year and bring friends and family together.” The retailer Wayfair’s style adviser, Nadia McCowan Hill, told Ideal Homes magazine: “After a cold, wet and stormy winter, we’re looking ahead to brighter times and being able to celebrate the arrival of spring. 2022 is all about marking milestones and welcoming new hopeful chapters and it seems UK shoppers are planning to go big this Easter, with customer searches increasing by up to 500% for Easter trees, hanging eggs and Easter wreaths.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Bounce in Easter retail as trend for seasonal decorations grows,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/03/easter-decorations-crackers-wreaths-trees-retail-sales
4/4/2022,"Twenty and counting. England rang the changes in Parma after their emphatic win in Edinburgh but the result was the same, Simon Middleton’s side scoring 12 tries for that 20th successive victory. France had looked mightily impressive on Saturday and they are the only side that can live with England. Their meeting with the Red Roses at the end of the month is certain to decide the destiny of this year’s Women’s Six Nations. In one of those nine changes the head coach made from the previous weekend the scrum‑half Natasha Hunt returned for her first international match in 18 months. Hunt is said to have fallen out of love with the game during lockdown but she looked delighted again to be in a white shirt, forming an instant rapport with her half-back partner Zoe Harrison. It was a pretty perfect return for Hunt, who was named player of the match by the Italian hosts and she has put down a marker for a World Cup place this autumn in New Zealand as England try to win the trophy they last held in 2014. Lydia Thompson might have had a claim to that award with a hat-trick of tries, the final score coming with the last move of the match. It was a ruthless performance by England against a side that was overwhelmed. The only small cloud on the Red Rose horizon was an injury to their captain, Poppy Cleall, who finished with an ice-pack around her right knee after a thumping tackle from the Italian lock Sara Tounesi. For Italy it was a desperate afternoon. It isn’t easy when you are forced to make more than 200 tackles in a match and Italy competed well at the breakdown but eventually their blue defensive ball was breached time and again and they compounded their misery with countless errors. Little was seen of their talented centre Beatrice Rigoni who was shown a yellow card near the end for killing the ball. It summed up Italy’s day. Sadly, there was never much doubt who were the professionals and who were the amateurs out there. Hunt helped to fashion the first try after four minutes, Sarah McKenna as surprised as anyone to stroll over in the corner with no defender in sight. England had looked to run the ball from the first whistle and when Helena Rowland found some space on the right the centre smartly worked England’s other wing, Thompson, over in the corner. The England pack drove forwards from a lineout and Lark Davies plunged over for a third try. The Harlequins prop Shaunagh Brown then battered her way for the fourth bonus-point try with less than half an hour on the clock and Italy were clearly in for a long afternoon. The outstanding Alex Matthews, another of the changes from the previous week, was driven over by her fellow forwards before the break. The one-way traffic continued in the second half as England stretched the Italian defence and Thompson glided over for her second try. Vicky Fleetwood, a replacement early in the second half, was soon on the try‑scoring act with a score from a drive by the forwards from a lineout. Fleetwood, though, was positively sluggish in scoring her try compared to Sarah Bern who had been on the field for seconds when, with her first touch of the ball, she streamed 30 metres down the touchline to outflank the tiring Italian defence. The theme continued when Emma Sing came on. It was not Rowland’s best pass but the ball stuck and the full-back raced away to score in the same corner. Middleton had waited a quarter of an hour before the end before bringing on Emily Scarratt who latched on to a perfect little grubber kick from Harrison to score near the posts. It needed the intervention of the television match official to rule that England had not obstructed a defender but by now it was turning into an onslaught. Hunt said: “I played a small part in fizzing the ball out to that incredible backline.” She was being modest but Hunt knows that she was given an armchair ride by her dominant pack, forwards who are being honed into a real force under the tutelage of the former England lock Louis Deacon. Cleall said: “We worked our socks off out there. It didn’t pay off all of the time but we brought on nine players and it was pretty seamless.” Middleton will no doubt be tinkering with his line-up again when his side meet rejuvenated Wales at Kingsholm this weekend. In truth, it will hardly matter who he picks on the strength of another impressive afternoon’s work.",Sport/Sport,Lydia Thompson’s hat-trick completes England’s 12-try thrashing of Italy,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/03/italy-england-womens-six-nations-match-report
4/4/2022,"My brother-in-law Derrick Goodwin, who has died aged 86, was a theatre and television director and a writer. He was born in London, to a Swedish mother and a British father who divorced when he was a baby. Custody was given to his father and Derrick was brought up in London by three aunts, and educated at St Mary’s school, Hendon, before taking a BA in music at the Royal College of Music. As a young man he undertook national service in the Royal Air Force in what was then Malaya as a dog handler, extending his service by five years. Derrick started out in stage management at the Royal Court Theatre and then went to Leicester, where in 1960 he converted an old school and started the Living Theatre Company with Ken Loach, Jill Gascoine and Brian Grellis. He returned to the Royal Court to produce a Pirandello play, and then became the assistant director at the Open Air Theatre in Regent’s Park in the early 1960s. His next role was as artistic director of the Dundee Repertory Company, where he met the actor Nell Curran; they married in 1980. He also worked at the Citizens theatre, Glasgow as the associate director, and at Ipswich Arts theatre and the Nottingham Playhouse. Derrick began a career in BBC television directing episodes in such series as Thirty Minute Theatre (1969). He decided to become freelance to co-write and direct series including Dear Mother … Love Albert, which he wrote and produced with Rodney Bewes, and directed the first three series (1969-71). He produced and directed drama and comedy series, including New Scotland Yard (1974), Thick as Thieves (1974), Within These Walls (1975), Z Cars (1976-77), Doctor Who (1977), Mixed Blessings (1978-80, for which he also wrote), and many others. He spent a period in Canada, setting up a new drama and entertainment department for the Canadian Broadcasting Company, and on returning to the UK worked for the BBC and London Weekend Television, Thames TV and Yorkshire TV. He was commissioned by Alan Ayckbourn to write a play, Abiding Passions, an adaptation of Emile Zola’s Thérèse Raquin, for the Stephen Joseph theatre, Scarborough, in 1990, which was then produced at the Palace theatre, Watford, and the Riverside Studios, Hammersmith.

4/4/2022,"Hillary Clinton has called on Democrats “to do a better job” of selling themselves to America’s voters to avoid humiliation in this year’s midterm elections where Republicans are widely expected to perform strongly and likely grab control of Congress. The former Democratic presidential candidate was speaking frankly on NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday, saying she thought last summer’s chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan was harmful to Joe Biden. The US president’s approval ratings have slumped in recent weeks to the lowest level since he took office. “I don’t think it helped, that is obviously the case,” Clinton, the former New York senator and secretary of state, told host Chuck Todd when asked if she thought Biden’s political troubles started with Afghanistan. “But there are a lot of good accomplishments to be putting up on the board. And the Democrats in office and out need to be doing a better job of making the case.” “The best politics is doing the best job that you can do. And there’s a lot that Democrats can talk about in these upcoming midterms. We’ve got a great story to tell. And we need to get out there and do a better job of telling it.” Clinton believes that Democrats are holding themselves back by constant introspection, which she said was “always the chorus in Democratic party politics.” “Hand wringing is part of the Democratic DNA. That seems to be in style whether we’re in or out of power. We’re in power and there still is hand wringing going on,” she said. “But from my perspective, President Biden is doing a very good job… his handling of Ukraine, passing the American rescue package, the huge infrastructure package. “I’m not quite sure what the disconnect is between the accomplishments of the administration, and this Congress, and the understanding of what’s been done, and the impact it will have on the American public, and some of the polling and the ongoing hand wringing.” Clinton also had criticism for Republicans, whom she said were experiencing “an even greater disconnect” than her own party. Democrats, she said, need to be “standing up to the other side with their craziness and their calls for impunity and nuttiness that we hear coming from them. I don’t think the average American, frankly, wants to be governed by people who live in a totally different reality.” Todd questioned Clinton about Russian president Vladimir Putin, who was hostile towards her when she was Barack Obama’s secretary of state, and whose support for her 2016 presidential opponent Donald Trump, some believe, was partly fueled by his hatred for her. “We are seeing very clearly the threat that he poses, not just to Ukraine, as we can watch every night on our news, but really, to Europe, to democracy, and the global stability that we thought we were building in the last 20 years,” she said. “I would not allow Russia back into the organizations it has been a part of. There is a G20 event later in the year. I would not permit Russia to attend, and if they insisted on literally showing up I would hope there would be a significant, if not total, boycott.”",News/US news,Hillary Clinton urges Democrats to ‘do a better job’ of telling voters of successes,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/03/hillary-clinton-urges-democrats-tell-voters-accomplishments
4/4/2022,"At the home of their nearest neighbours, Harlequins put on an exhibition, scoring seven tries to cement their hold on third spot on the Premiership table with an impressive 41-14 win over London Irish. Marcus Smith was imperious, providing the final pass for two of his team’s scores, and Joe Marchant underlined his England credentials as the defending champions kept their hopes of a home semi-final alive, and did so in some style. Irish gave as good as they got. Perhaps not on the scoreboard, but their enterprise and dynamism with ball in hand meant they contributed to the entertainment at least. There were many impressive performances. All four starting centres – Curtis Rona and Bernard Janse van Rensburg for Irish, Marchant and André Esterhuizen for Quins – ran with zealous intent and procured four turnovers on the ground between them. Alex Dombrandt was a strong carrier and Hugh Tizard was a tower in Harlequins’ tight five. But there was one star among stars. Smith ran the show for an hour. When he straightened and attacked the line he caused panic among the men in green. He stretched the defence at will, either through cross-field kicks or floating skipped passes. He was uncharacteristically wayward from the tee, missing three of his five shots at goal, but he showed just why so many people want him to be England’s starting 10 whether Owen Farrell is available or not. It was his opposite number, though, who got things rolling. Harlequins made a mess of a quickly taken lineout inside their own 22 and coughed up possession when Esterhuizen was isolated on the ground. Irish moved the ball swiftly down the right and Paddy Jackson collected a Rona skip-pass to canter home unimpeded. The fly-half kicked the conversion for a deserved 7-0 lead. Quins responded soon after. Their scrum, which had gained an early ascendency with Joe Marler bossing the set-piece, won a penalty which Smith nudged in the corner. Jack Walker fed George Hammond in the middle and had it back at the base of a rolling maul. The hooker retained his latch and dotted down. Smith restored parity with the extras. Irish thought they had their second when Ollie Hassell-Collins was adjudged to have knocked on when replays showed barely a sliver of daylight between his hand and the ball as he dotted it down in the corner. That would be as good as it got for the home supporters. Smith had the option of an easy three points but instead went to the corner again. That decision changed the momentum of the match. The lineout was won and several phases later Smith’s delightful ball over the top evaded Hassell-Collins by a millimetre and found Cadan Murley on the wing. Smith was again the supplier when he exploited an overlap down the left, feeding Huw Jones on the angle. Marchant came close to scoring just before but his busting run was stopped short under the poles. With numbers either side of him, Smith chose the right option to set up his full-back. Nick Phipps received a yellow card for cynically slowing a Quins attack while on the ground. He watched on as a neat line-out led to Walker playing a quick give and go with Tizard at the front of the line. That secured the bonus-point and ended the match as a contest, but the spectacle still had 40 minutes to run. The second half started as the first ended, with Quins registering a five-pointer. Danny Care burrowed over from close range to score his 79th Premiership try. Smith found his range from the conversion before he was substituted. Lucio Cinti should have scored for Irish when he jinked off his right foot and charged into the try area but Tizard tipped the ball out of the careless winger’s hands. Care was shown yellow for a deliberate knock on as the game descended into a counterattacking competition. It was thrilling, if disjointed, and Esterhuizen and Janse van Rensburg scored a try apiece as gaps opened across the park, making it a productive day for South African centres. With the final whistle looming, Jones notched his second when he gathered a wide pass with both feet in the air before landing acrobatically and scampering home in the corner. One Premiership game can’t solve all of the RFU’s problems on its own. No try-fest will dispel the sense that Eddie Jones has run out of ideas as England coach. No Smith masterclass in Harlequins colours can erase the fact that Championship clubs have been cut adrift to fend for themselves. And though anxieties over race and class and a reliance on foreign imports persists, 80 riotous minutes between the defending Premiership champions and London Irish was a timely reminder that this league is at least capable of putting on a hell of a show.",Sport/Sport,Marcus Smith runs the show for Harlequins in rout of London Irish,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/03/london-irish-harlequins-premiership-match-report
4/4/2022,"My father, Richard Evans, who has died aged 79, dedicated his life to widening access to education, a mission born of his experience of being called a failure while at primary school, thanks to the 11-plus. He was born in Solihull to Mildred (nee Bryant), who went into domestic service in her early teens, and Benjamin Evans, a career sailor who joined the navy aged 14. Richard failed the 11-plus on two occasions, yet he went on to achieve five degrees, including a PhD in physics. He credited this to the support of teachers who encouraged his love of science. After attending Hilsea secondary modern school, Portsmouth, Richard took his A-levels at Portsmouth Technical College, while working night shifts in various jobs, including at R White’s lemonade factory. He studied physics at the University of London, graduating in 1965, and did his doctorate at the University of Essex, completing in 1969. He later took a Graduate Certificate in Education in London, an MEd at Manchester University (1977) and a DMS (Diploma in Management Studies, 2000). He started his career in 1971 as a lecturer in further education at Great Yarmouth. After three years teaching in Blackpool, in 1978 he became head of science, maths and computing at Peterborough Technical College. In 1982 he became deputy principal at Cornwall College and in 1990 was appointed principal and CEO at Stockport College of Further and Higher Education. Throughout his career he looked for ways to help widen access and to support local technical education. At Great Yarmouth he set up a class for special educational needs, which he ran on top of his lecturing duties. At Blackpool he created a primary school science centre. At Peterborough he created a centre for local technical expertise in sugar processing. Richard contributed to a national inquiry into technology education, chaired by Monty Finniston (1988), and to the Royal Society’s Beyond GCSE report in 1991. He also developed a maths teaching diploma for primary schools. He was chair, member or representative of over 30 bodies, including the Engineering Council and the Association for Science. On retirement from Stockport in 2002, he worked as a consultant and was an active member of the Institute of Physics, City and Guilds, and the Institute of Leadership and Management. Despite never passing his English O-level, he was a prolific writer, with 350 articles published on education and science. Richard never forgot his background, and while this drove his work, it often left him frustrated at the unfairness of a system stacked against so many. He had a lifelong love of blues music and film noir and always had a hobby on the go: growing vegetables, learning Mandarin, gazing at the stars through his telescope, or on his barge, the John Lee Hooker. In 1971 he married Carol Morrell.

4/4/2022,"My friend Hattie Ladbury, who has died of cancer aged 47, was an actor at ease with any text and on any stage. She created the part of Sophie in Natasha Gordon’s Nine Night at the National Theatre in 2018 and was the first female Duke in Measure for Measure. Three weeks before her death she was on stage as the Duke at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, London, blazing with charisma, driving the show with wit, playfulness and anger. Nothing daunted her, and she had no interest in letting her illness get in the way. Born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, she was the daughter of Jean Scott, who worked in educational services, and Roger Ladbury, a land agent and surveyor. She grew up in the village of Britford, and attended South Wilts grammar school. After joining Stage 65 at the age of 10, Hattie became a leading member of the youth theatre, appearing in West Side Story and Grease, and went on to train at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, where she won the Gold Medal. She later returned to Salisbury Playhouse in several productions including The Winslow Boy and The Game of Love and Chance. In 2002 Hattie starred as Marlene in Thea Sharrock’s production of Top Girls. More major roles followed, including Gwendolen in The Importance of Being Earnest (Bath Theatre Royal), and Luciana in Jonathan Munby’s Comedy of Errors (Sheffield Crucible). Oliver Fenwick was the lighting designer on Comedy of Errors, and when Hattie met him she, as she put it, “threw myself at him without shame”. They married in 2007 and had two children, Lucy and Ted. She made permanent friends on every show, and directors regularly asked her back. Helena in A Midsummer Night’s Dream was one of five appearances at Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre. Her partnership with Doug Rintoul created triumphant performances as Amanda in Private Lives, Beatrice in Much Ado about Nothing and Hester in The Deep Blue Sea. In 2018 she was cast as Sophie in Nine Night, at the National and, following ecstatic reviews, in the West End. Tim Sheader, artistic director of Regent’s Park, said: “Hattie’s method was rigorous, no nonsense, full of humour and unsentimental heart. She filled this enormous stage here with scale and nuance and always lit up the night sky we sat below.” Michelle Terry, artistic director of Shakespeare’s Globe, said: “Hattie was pure theatre. All of us at the Globe are humbled and inspired to have been even a small part of her story.” I was lucky enough to work with Hattie on Measure for Measure, The Seven Year Itch, The Comedy of Errors, and The Norman Conquests. In rehearsal she was funny, practical and grounded. Then she would get on stage and knock you sideways with the scale of her feeling, and the truthfulness, energy and punch of her acting. She had a mercurial quickness and absolute precision. She combined a sharp eye for human folly with the courage to make herself vulnerable. She had effortless comic timing. Her performances fizzed. She was effervescent company, too, open-hearted and generous with friends, but stoical to the point of reserve about her own difficulties. She had a fierce intelligence, a brilliant wild streak and boundless kindness.

With the original cast reprising their roles 25 years since we last saw them in all their glory, the new series, filmed in Sheffield and Manchester, will see the gang battling crumbling healthcare and employment in their city. The original screenwriter Simon Beaufoy, who also wrote Slumdog Millionaire, is behind the reboot, and Andrew Chaplin and Catherine Morshead are directing. There is little chance of Shiregreen working men’s club featuring in the latest offering, but back in 1997 it was used as the focal point of the characters’ lives and provided the concert room where they bared all in the film’s famous final scene. Today, though boarded up, it still sports a sign on the front saying “Home of the Full Monty” and has attracted visitors from all over the world. When the venue was bought in 2013 by the local firm Eyre Enterprises, members and regulars expected it to maintain its status as a tourist hotspot, but in summer 2018, the club members were asked to vacate, and owner Peter Eyre kept the club open for 12 more weeks before closing it in November. It has remained vacant since. In recent years, the firm has bought several other working men’s clubs in the area, one of which has been demolished to make way for apartments. Shiregreen locals are desperate to ensure their club does not meet the same fate and believe the new series, set to run on Disney+ later this year, could have come just in time. Shiregreen was originally chosen as a location by 20th Century Fox for “its feel of authenticity as a community hub in the north of England”, says former steward Ann Bentley. She was behind the bar during filming and recalls the chaos as scores of extras turned up every day for weeks. “They were paid £40 per day – a small fortune,” she laughs, “but we didn’t get anything – except of course the extra punters who wanted to catch a glimpse of the action.” “I remember the Oscars feed cutting to us all at the club as we waited to hear if we’d won the best picture prize,” she says. “In the end, Titanic just pipped us to the post.” Bentley met her husband, Roy, at the club in the 1960s and went on to run it with him when he was made redundant. When Roy died 13 years ago, the Sheffield Telegraph ran a piece dedicated to him, the “real Full Monty man”. When the club closed four years ago, Bentley set to work compiling a petition to save it in her husband’s memory. Despite getting more than a thousand signatures, the club’s future remains in the balance, with the windows boarded and a demolition notice hanging outside. There has been no public announcement about what the owners’ intentions are for the building. Bentley believes Covid has slowed down proceedings for the developers, and hopes the new TV series might garner the attention the campaign needs to finally succeed. “It’s such an important place for so many people, and it would be a dream come true to see it open again.” Peter Price, a councillor for the Shiregreen and Brightside ward, agrees. He used to hold his regular surgery there, and says: “The notion that there is no future in this type of club is wrong. It retained a large membership right up until it closed, and even then there were several bids submitted by groups who wanted to hire it. It could thrive again in the right hands.” Long-term club secretary and life member David Howden says the campaigners “won’t back down” and adds: “The club has been open for nearly a century, and the community needs it now more than ever.” The Guardian contacted Eyre Enterprises but it declined to comment. The new series will be aired in eight 60-minute instalments on Disney+, Star+ in Latin America and Hulu in the US.",News/UK news,Campaigners hope TV series will save Full Monty working men’s club,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/03/campaigners-hope-tv-series-will-save-full-monty-working-mens-club
