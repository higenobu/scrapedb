1/16/2022,"Several beaches on Australia’s east coast remain closed due to a tsunami warning for New South Wales and parts of Victoria and Tasmania following the eruption of an underwater volcano off the coast of Tonga. The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) cancelled the warning for Queensland beaches late on Sunday morning, but were still urging caution at beaches in three states and islands off the Australian east coast.  All beaches in NSW were closed to swimmers, while beaches in Victoria between Lakes Entrance and 60 nautical miles east of Gabo Island, and in Tasmania from the northern tip of Flinders Island to South East Cape, were also subject to the bureau’s latest warning. The bureau said impacts of the tsunami were detected on Saturday at Lord Howe Island, where unusual currents and waves were observed at Ned’s Beach, and about 45 minutes later in the River Derwent in Hobart, where a half-metre tidal surge was recorded in the marina. Land warnings were issued earlier for Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island, however by 10.30am on Sunday these were downgraded to marine warnings. “In areas with a threat to the marine environment only, emergency authorities advise people to get out of the water and move away from the immediate water’s edge of harbours, coastal estuaries, rock platforms and beaches,” the bureau said in a statement. BoM meteorologist Sarah Scully said these warnings would remain in place until there were “no significant observations for six hours”. “We’re waiting to be really sure that the impacts and the energy from the volcanic eruption has dispersed and it’s no longer a danger to any people out of the water,” she told ABC News. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, urged people to follow the rules on Sunday, saying the beaches would remain closed until the state received updated information from the BoM. “These rules are in place to protect you and to keep you safe,” he said. The NSW State Emergency Service commissioner, Carlene York, said she expected the beaches to be closed until at least early afternoon. “A lot of you will be disappointed that it’s going to be a very humid day and they want to get into the beach but to protect this community, the beaches are closed,” she said. The eruption at 0410 GMT of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai underwater volcano, located about 65km (40 miles) north of Tonga’s capital, Nuku’alofa, caused a 1.2-metre tsunami, the BoM said. The eruption – captured in satellite images that show a huge plume of ash, steam and gas rising from the ocean – was heard and felt as far away as in Fiji and Vanuatu, where people reported feeling the ground and buildings shaking for hours. There were no immediate reports of injuries or the extent of the damage in Tonga, but online videos showed huge waves in coastal areas, swirling around homes and buildings. The Australian health minister, Greg Hunt, said there were no reports that Australians in Tonga had been injured. He said during his Covid update on Sunday that the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade were working with Tongan authorities. “Dfat will continue to engage with the Tongan government and has offered through the foreign minister all possible support that may be required,” Hunt said. – with Australian Associated Press",News/World news,Australia tsunami warning: east coast beaches closed after undersea volcano erupts near Tonga,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/16/australia-tsunami-warning-east-coast-beaches-closed-after-undersea-volcano-erupts-near-tonga
