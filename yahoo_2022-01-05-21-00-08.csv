1/5/2022,"Even as daily new COVID cases set all-time records and hospitals fill up, epidemiologists have arrived at a perhaps surprising consensus. Yes, the latest Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus is bad. But it could have been a lot worse. Even as cases have surged, deaths haven’t—at least not to the same degree. Omicron is highly transmissible but generally not as severe as some older variants—“lineages” is the scientific term. We got lucky. But that luck might not hold. Many of the same epidemiologists who have breathed a sigh of relief over Omicron’s relatively low death rate are anticipating that the next lineage might be much worse. The New Version of the Omicron Variant Is a Sneaky Little Bastard Fretting over a possible future lineage that combines Omicron’s extreme transmissibility with the severity of, say, the previous Delta lineage, experts are beginning to embrace a new public health strategy that’s getting an early test run in Israel: a four-shot regimen of messenger-RNA vaccine. “I think this will be the strategy going forward,” Edwin Michael, an epidemiologist at the Center for Global Health Infectious Disease Research at the University of South Florida, told The Daily Beast. Omicron raised alarms in health agencies all over the world in late November after officials in South Africa reported the first cases. Compared to older lineages, Omicron features around 50 key mutations, some 30 of which are on the spike protein that helps the virus to grab onto our cells. Some of the mutations are associated with a virus’s ability to dodge antibodies and thus partially evade vaccines. Others are associated with higher transmissibility. The lineage’s genetic makeup pointed to a huge spike in infections in the unvaccinated as well as an increase in milder “breakthrough” infections in the vaccinated. That’s exactly what happened. Health officials registered more than 10 million new COVID cases the first week of January. That’s nearly double the previous worst week for new infections, back in May. Around 3 million of those infections were in the United States, where Omicron coincided with the Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year holidays and associated traveling and family gatherings. But mercifully, deaths haven’t increased as much as cases have. Worldwide, there were 43,000 COVID deaths the first week of January—fewer than 10,000 of them in the U.S. While deaths tend to lag infections by a couple weeks, Omicron has been dominant long enough that it’s increasingly evident there’s been what statisticians call a “decoupling” of cases and fatalities. “We can say we dodged a bullet in that Omicron does not appear to cause as serious of a disease,” Stephanie James, the head of a COVID testing lab at Regis University in Colorado, told The Daily Beast. She stressed that data is still being gathered, so we can’t be certain yet that the apparent decoupling is real. Assuming the decoupling is happening, experts attribute it to two factors. First, Omicron tends to infect the throat without necessarily descending to the lungs, where the potential for lasting or fatal damage is much, much higher. Second, by now, countries have administered nearly 9.3 billion doses of vaccine—enough for a majority of the world’s population to have received at least one dose. Omicron Shows the Unvaccinated Will Never Be Safe In the United States, 73 percent of people have gotten at least one dose. Sixty-two percent have gotten two doses of the best mRNA vaccines. A third have received a booster dose. Yes, Omicron has some ability to evade antibodies, meaning the vaccines are somewhat less effective against this lineage than they are against Delta and other older lineages. But even when a vaccine doesn’t prevent an infection, it usually greatly reduces its severity. For many vaccinated people who’ve caught Omicron, the resulting COVID infection is mild. “A common cold or some sniffles in a fully vaxxed and boosted healthy individual,” is how Eric Bortz, a University of Alaska-Anchorage virologist and public health expert, described it to The Daily Beast. All that is to say, Omicron could have been a lot worse. Viruses evolve to survive. That can mean greater transmissibility, antibody-evasion or more serious infection. Omicron mutated for the former two. There’s a chance some future Sigma or Upsilon lineage could do all three. When it comes to viral mutations, “extreme events can occur at a non-negligible rate, or probability, and can lead to large consequences,” Michael said. Imagine a lineage that’s as transmissible as Omicron but also attacks the lungs like Delta tends to do. Now imagine that this hypothetical lineage is even more adept than Omicron at evading the vaccines. 2022’s Hottest New Illness: Flurona That would be the nightmare lineage. And it’s entirely conceivable it’s in our future. There are enough vaccine holdouts, such as the roughly 50 million Americans who say they’ll never get jabbed, that the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen should have ample opportunities for mutation. “As long as we have unvaccinated people in this country—and across the globe—there is the potential for new and possibly more concerning viral variants to arise,” Aimee Bernard, a University of Colorado immunologist, told The Daily Beast. Worse, this ongoing viral evolution is happening against a backdrop of waning immunity. Antibodies, whether vaccine-induced or naturally occurring from past infection, fade over time. It’s not for no reason that health agencies in many countries urge booster doses just three months after initial vaccination. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is an outlier, and recommends people get boosted after five months. A lineage much worse than Omicron could evolve at the same time that antibodies wane in billions of people all over the world. That’s why many experts believe the COVID vaccines will end up being annual or even semi-annual jabs. You’ll need a fourth jab, a fifth jab, a sixth jab, et cetera, forever. Israel, a world leader in global health, is already turning that expectation into policy. Citing multiple studies that showed a big boost in antibodies with an additional dose of mRNA and no safety concerns, the country’s health ministry this week began offering a fourth dose to anyone over the age of 60, who tend to be more vulnerable to COVID than younger people. That should be the standard everywhere, Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington Institute for Health, told The Daily Beast. “Scientifically, they’re right,” he said of the Israeli health officials. If there’s a downside, it’s that there are still a few poorer countries—in Africa, mostly—where many people still struggle to get access to any vaccine, let alone boosters and fourth doses. If and when other richer countries follow Israel’s lead and begin offering additional jabs, there’s some risk of even greater inequity in global vaccine distribution. “The downside is for the rest of the world,” Mokdad said. “I’m waiting to get my first dose and you guys are getting a fourth?” The solution isn’t to deprive people of the doses they need to maintain their protection against future—and potentially more dangerous—lineages. The solution, for vaccine-producing countries, is to further boost production and double down on efforts to push vaccines out to the least privileged communities. A sense of urgency is key. For all its rapid spread, Omicron has actually gone fairly easy on us. Sigma or Upsilon might not. Read more at The Daily Beast. Get our top stories in your inbox every day. Sign up now!

1/5/2022,"Victoria’s Secret isn’t giving itself a makeover as a New Year’s resolution. After all, the lingerie and beauty company has been evolving its look for the last few calendar years. Courtesy Photo Zoey Grossman More from WWD Salvatore Ferragamo Pre-Fall 2022 Jil Sander Pre-Fall 2022 Diesel Pre-Fall 2022 Once part of L Brands, which also owned Bath & Body Works, Victoria’s Secret began losing revenues and falling out of favor with consumers in 2017, right around the time the #MeToo Movement began to gain traction. A series of events — including L Brands’ founder Leslie H. Wexner’s association with registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein; former L Brands’ chief marketing officer Ed Razek’s less-than-flattering comments regarding plus-size and transgender models in late 2018; a look that many considered outdated, and more than a few digital bra brands ready and eager to take share — didn’t help much in Victoria’s Secret’s mission to get back on track. Courtesy Photo After a deal to sell a majority stake of the Victoria’s Secret Lingerie, Beauty and Pink businesses to private equity firm Sycamore Partners fell through, the retailer regrouped and thought of a new plan: Spin off the more lucrative Bath & Body Works operation from the lingerie and beauty businesses in order to unlock investor value in both brands. Last August the plan became a reality, with Victoria’s Secret & Co. debuting on the New York Stock Exchange as an independent public company. (L Brands was also rebranded as Bath & Body Works.) Investors applauded the separation, with shares of the new Victoria’s Secret & Co. shooting up 29 percent on their first day of trading. But the spin-off wasn’t the only thing Victoria’s Secret had in its favor. In fact, the company was in complete transformation mode. The strategy included updating the board to include a majority of women (six out of seven); adding a string of executives to the C-suite; updating the assortment to include things like swimwear and sports bras, and closing unprofitable stores to make way for more lucrative markets, such as Milan, Israel and India. The biggest change, however, came when Victoria’s Secret updated its marketing materials and store imagery. The high-profile Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, which served as a marketing tool for the company — but was criticized by many as culturally tone-deaf — was canceled in late 2019.  In its place the lingerie and innerwear giant hired its first plus-size model, Ali Tate Cutler, as well as its first transgender model, Valentina Sampaio. In May 2021, Victoria’s Secret upped the ante once again, using nine-months-pregnant model Grace Elizabeth in its Mother’s Day campaign. Images of the fallen Angels were also ripped from the entire store fleet and replaced with plus-size mannequins, soft lighting and mirrors, so shoppers could quite literally see themselves reflected back in the products.  Courtesy Photo Perhaps the most noticeable change came last summer, when Victoria’s Secret introduced the VS Collective, a group of women who are admired for their intellectual and professional accomplishments, rather than their physical beauty. The VS Collective includes model and mental health advocate Hailey Bieber; actress and entrepreneur Priyanka Chopra; world champion freestyle skier Eileen Gu; professional soccer player and LGBTQ activist Megan Rapinoe; plus-size model Paloma Elsesser, and tennis champion Naomi Osaka, among others, who share their stories by way of collaborations, campaigns and social media.  Courtesy Photo “[It’s] moving from a position of, frankly, being irrelevant to being relevant for being — for him to for her, being more inclusive rather than exclusive,” Martin Waters, chief executive officer of Victoria’s Secret Lingerie, said in May. “We have a clear reason why we exist at Victoria’s now and that is to inspire women around the world with products and experiences that uplift them and champion them and support their journey. It’s their narrative, not ours. “I have a bold ambition that Victoria’s [Secret] should be the world’s biggest and best advocate for women,” Waters said. “And that’s an incredibly powerful vision and mission for us to aim toward and it’s energizing for all of our people. And it does reflect a very significant turnaround from where we’ve been, where we’re moving from what men want to what women want. We’re moving from sexy for a few to sexy for all. We’re moving from a look to a feeling. It’s about including most women rather than excluding most women and being grounded in real life rather than mostly unattainable. So I couldn’t underscore how significant this turnaround and this repositioning is. It’s a very dramatic change for us and we have significant proof points already at this early stage in our journey that this is what the customer wants from us. So expect more.” Courtesy Photo Adrian Wilson Most recently, Victoria’s Secret unveiled the VS Store of the Future in Chicago, the first of three set to open in coming months. (The other two will be in Houston and Birmingham, Ala.) The redesigned space includes an assortment of gender-neutral products, a larger size range, open flooring, a beauty bar, LED lighting and fluffy pink couches in the fitting room for relaxing or socializing.  “This concept is all about femininity, openness and community,” Albert Gilkey, Victoria’s Secret’s senior vice president, store design and construction, told WWD in December.  But will the transformation work? And will consumers, many of whom abandoned the brand during the height of the #MeToo Movement, return?  So far, shoppers are “really noticing [the changes] and voting with their wallet,” Waters said earlier last year.  “The repositioning of the brand continues to gain great momentum and that shows up in our sales,” the CEO added in November. “It shows up in the help of the [customer] file [with new customers to the brand], shows up in our social media likes and follower-ship, 71 million followers on Instagram and some really strong responses. “Our job is to just make the best out of the assortment that we’ve got and that’s what we’re doing on a day-to-day basis,” he said.  Courtesy Photo In the most recent quarter, total company revenues were $1.4 billion, up from $1.35 billion a year earlier, helping the company log $75 million in net profits. In addition, Victoria’s Secret is anticipating full fiscal-year 2021 revenues to increase by about 25 percent.  “We have reason to believe we might do better, but we’re not guiding to that,” Waters told analysts at the time.  Becky Behringer, Victoria’s Secret’s executive head of stores, told WWD in December that the added technology in fitting rooms is helping the retailer attract a younger fanbase, many of them Gen Z shoppers, “because this is the language that they speak, this is how they communicate, oftentimes through their screens. So it’s more comfortable for them. This tool is a total game-changer for us from a selling experience and a service experience.” In late December, company shares shot up about 11 percent after the company revealed a $250 million stock buyback plan while also reaffirming its fourth-quarter guidance. Waters called out strength in all categories, particularly during the all-important holiday shopping season between Thanksgiving and Christmas.  “This is a clear positive event on one of the cheapest names under coverage,” Ike Boruchow, senior retail analyst at Wells Fargo, wrote in a note, rating the stock “overweight” and setting a price target of $85 a share. “The fact that the company called out encouraging trends in the business (particularly in stores) over key holiday periods indeed suggests their confidence headed into 2022 in lapping stimulus compares (starting in January), as well as in navigating supply chain disruption. VSCO has showed us the brand momentum remains on track and increasingly shareholder-friendly actions are yet another reason to remain positive. We don’t see anything today that changes our bullish stance on the company at current levels.” Sign up for WWD's Newsletter.

1/5/2022,"MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Tuesday suggested “all Americans” would like to know exactly what Fox News’ Sean Hannity knew of former President Donald Trump’s plot to overturn the 2020 election following the release of Hannity’s text messages to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows before the Jan. 6 insurrection. Hannity told Meadows on the night before the violence that he was “very worried about the next 48 hours,” according to a series of messages released Tuesday by the House select committee investigating the attack. The committee, in a letter requesting Hannity preserve his communications and cooperate with its investigation, said the network personality (who has previously campaigned for Trump) appeared to have had “advance knowledge” of the then-president’s “planning for Jan. 6th.” Hannity has not yet indicated whether he will cooperate with the probe. “I think regardless of party, regardless of cable news outlet of your choice, all Americans would like to know what Mr. Hannity knew on Jan. 5 that made him text to the White House, ‘I am very worried about the next 48 hours,’” said Maddow. “What did he know about what was going to happen that made him tell the White House chief of staff he was very worried?” Watch the video here: This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

1/5/2022,"Peter Navarro described Trump allies' plans to decertify the 2020 election results to MSNBC. He detailed the plans to challenge the results in battleground states. Host Ari Melber shot back, asking: ""Do you realize you are describing a coup?"" The MSNBC host Ari Melber challenged former Trump White House economic advisor Peter Navarro over his description of plans to challenge the 2020 presidential election result, saying that he was actually ""describing a coup."" Navarro has promoted Trump's baseless claims that President Joe Biden, who has been in office for nearly a year, did not actually win the 2020 election. In a Tuesday appearance on ""The Beat,"" Melber asked Navarro about Trump allies' plans to challenge Biden's win. Navarro told ""The Beat"" that the plan was to use over 100 US representatives and senators to ""challenge the results of the election in the six battleground states"" — Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin, and Nevada. ""And, basically, these were the places where we believed that if the votes were sent back to those battleground states and looked at again, that there would be enough concern amongst the legislatures that most or all of those states would decertify the election,"" Navarro said. He continued: ""That would throw the election to the House of Representatives. And I would say to you here, Ari, that all of this, again, was in the lanes, legally. It was prescribed by the Constitution. There is a provision to go – rather than through the Electoral College – to the House of Representatives."" He said this process started when lawmakers began to challenge Arizona's results on January 6, 2021, and criticized the media. Melber then shot back: ""You just described this plan as a way to take an election where the outcome was established by independent secretaries of state, by the voters of those states, and legal remedies had been exhausted with the Supreme Court never even taking, let alone siding with any of the claims that you just referred to. So legally, they went nowhere."" He then described the plan that Navarro had outlined, and asked: ""Do you realize you are describing a coup?"" Navarro responded: ""No. I totally reject many of your premises there.""
