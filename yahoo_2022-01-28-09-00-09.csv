1/28/2022,"Nine police officers in Tennessee opened fire at a 37-year-old man on Thursday afternoon after a confrontation on an interstate highway in Nashville. The suspect, who police said had been sitting on a guardrail on the busy roadway, died. In a video filmed by a bystander and posted to Twitter by news outlet WSMV, the man can be seen standing still in the right lane of the highway as almost a dozen Tennessee Highway Patrolmen and Nashville Police look on, guns drawn. The entire highway is blocked on both sides. The man raises his arms towards police, and the video pauses. Multiple gunshots can then be heard. In a press briefing, Nashville Metro Police spokesman Don Aaron said the man was holding a box cutter in his left hand, and was shot when he suddenly pulled his right hand out of his pocket, holding a “shiny, silver cylindrical object.” Aaron said a Tennessee Highway Patrol officer was traveling along the interstate on Thursday afternoon when he noticed the man sitting on the guardrail. When the trooper stopped to help the man and spoke to him, trying to get him off the highway, the man pulled out a box cutter, Aaron said. An off-duty Mt. Juliet police officer, who was traveling home with his family, saw what was happening and stopped. The two tried to deescalate the situation for the better part of half an hour, according to Aaron. “The man was holding a box cutter in his left hand. His right hand was in his pocket,” Aaron said. But as police officers arrived and continued speaking to the man, he “suddenly” pulled an unidentified “shiny, silver cylindrical object” out of his right pocket, Aaron said. Nine officers, not knowing what the object was, according to Aaron, then shot the man. Aaron said that police have not yet determined what the object was but it was not a firearm. No Tasers were used, he added. The man was taken to a nearby hospital and pronounced dead. His identity has not been released but he has been arrested before, Aaron said. “Through the conversation, the trooper believed it would be OK. It was the pushing away from the trooper and producing the box cutter that escalated it up to a greater law enforcement response,” he said. Traffic on both sides of the highway was backed up for miles, according to The Tennessean. Two southbound lanes have since opened, but all northbound lanes remain close. This is a developing story...

1/28/2022,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — A Florida sheriff fired the president of his department's deputies union Thursday, capping a three-year battle that escalated when the union chief accused the sheriff of not providing deputies with adequate protective gear against COVID-19. Broward County Sheriff Gregory Tony said in a press release that he fired Deputy Jeff Bell for engaging in “corrupt practices” and “conduct unbecoming” of a deputy, saying Bell had lied about him to local news reporters in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent his election to a full term in November 2020. He said the office's professional standards board had unanimously recommended the firing. “The evidence shows Bell used corrupt practices to try to prevent me from being elected sheriff by providing misinformation and lies to the media to create fear and distrust among (Broward Sheriff's Office) employees and within the community during a global pandemic,” Tony said. ""This type of behavior is egregious at any time but even more harmful and shameful during an unprecedented health crisis.” No one answered the phone Thursday afternoon at the Broward Sheriff’s Office Deputies Association offices and Bell did not immediately respond to a text message from The Associated Press. He told the South Florida Sun Sentinel that he would fight his firing in court. A 26-year veteran of the sheriff's office, Bell has been president of the 1,400-member union since 2015. “This is so personal for Greg Tony,” Bell told the Fort Lauderdale newspaper. “He cannot separate business from personal. Anything you bring against the sheriff office, he looks as a personal attack against him.” Tony was appointed sheriff in 2019 by Gov. Ron DeSantis after the governor fired the previous sheriff, Scott Israel, for his alleged mishandling of the 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. The union initially backed the pick, but Tony and Bell soon began butting heads after the sheriff disciplined deputies for alleged excessive force. Bell said the deputies had only been following policy changes Tony had made. Tony said he had made no policy changes.   Their animosity reached a crescendo in April 2020 after a Broward deputy died of COVID-19, the first of at least three Broward deputies and six civilian employees to succumb to the disease.  Bell penned an opinion piece shortly after the death for the Sun Sentinel, accusing Tony of not providing sufficient masks and other protection for deputies in those early days of the pandemic.  “Tony has been politically fiddling with facts like Nero as Rome burned,” Bell wrote. “This so-called BSO savior, the man who rode into office with the support of distraught Parkland parents and this union, has failed to provide leadership.""  Tony quickly suspended Bell  with pay on accusations of lying, saying the union president knew the agency had provided deputies with 70,000 masks and hand sanitizer. He ordered Bell investigated. In a 200-page internal affairs report released Thursday, the sheriff told investigators Bell began attacking him because he wouldn't promote the union head to captain, “which was three ranks above his current rank."" “He used the pandemic to amplify those grievances publicly to hinder my candidacy for sheriff,"" Tony told investigators. The highest rank Tony held before being appointed sheriff was as a sergeant in a suburban police department. He had resigned from that department and was operating a consulting firm when DeSantis appointed him. Bell, when asked by investigators whether he asked Tony for a promotion, replied, “Absolutely not,” according to the report. In the interview, he told investigators that regardless of what Tony said about the agency distributing anti-COVID masks, he had numerous deputies telling him they had not received any. The investigators also asked Bell if he leaked to the media that Tony, at 14, had been arrested for fatally shooting an 18-year-old neighbor during a fight at his family's Philadelphia home in 1993. Court records have been destroyed, but Tony has said the shooting was later ruled self-defense.  Tony has been criticized for not disclosing the arrest to his previous employers or DeSantis before it appeared in local media in May 2020, a month after Bell's suspension. “I wish I could take credit for giving this to the media, but I did not,” Bell told investigators. “If you find out that an elected government official lied and covered up about his involvement in what was then an arrest for homicide, I think a lot of voters would want to know about that.” The story apparently did not hurt Tony's candidacy — he easily defeated former sheriff Israel in the Democratic primary and his Republican opponent in the 2020 general election.",U.S./Associated Press,Florida sheriff fires deputy union head after COVID-19 fight,https://news.yahoo.com/florida-sheriff-fires-deputy-union-212909922.html
1/28/2022,"A Texas college student working as a dog walker was permanently disfigured last month when two dogs pounced on her in a “bloodthirsty” attack, a civil lawsuit alleges. Jacqueline Claire Durand, 22, of Coppell, had just opened a home's front door on Dec. 23 where she intended to walk “Lucy,” a German shepherd mix-breed, and “Bender,” a mixed-breed pit bull, according to the lawsuit filed Tuesday in Dallas County. The animals were not in kennels and rushed at Durand, violently attacking her, the lawsuit said. Durand has undergone multiple surgeries since the mauling, per the lawsuit. “The Dogs knocked Jacqueline off balance, causing her to fall and drop her cell phone. Then, the Dogs violently attacked her head and face — mauling her catastrophically. The Dogs were so violent and bloodthirsty that they pulled all of Jacqueline’s clothes off, including her blue jeans,” the lawsuit said. The dogs tore off and ate her ears and most of her face below her eyes, according the lawsuit. It alleges negligence and premise liability by the dogs’ owners, Ashley Jo Bishop and Dr. Justin Avery Bishop. It also names them as defendants in their capacities as trustees in a family trust. The Bishops were not immediately reached for comment Thursday afternoon. Durand, an avid dog lover who worked as a dog sitter and walker while at the University of Texas at Dallas, never envisioned how her fondness for the animals would “cost her so much,” the lawsuit said. The day of the attack was the first time Durand was hired to walk the animals, although she had previously met the dogs when she discussed the job with Ashley Bishop, according to the lawsuit. The Bishops were aware their pets had violent tendencies, the lawsuit said, and the dogs were out of their kennels they were usually kept in. The defendants also knew their dogs were aggressive toward people who approach the front door, according to the suit. The lawsuit cited a sign by the Bishops’ home entrance which read: “Crazy Dogs. Please Don’t Knock or Ring the Bell. Call or Text Instead.” The sign also urged visitors to leave packages by the door, according to the lawsuit. The dogs were captured and placed in the care of the City of Coppell before a municipal judge decided earlier this month that both animals should be euthanized, according to NBC Dallas-Fort Worth. But Durand's attorneys have appealed the judge’s order to give them time to inspect the animals, the news outlet reported. Chip Brooker, an attorney representing Durand, said Thursday he's ""amazed by her strength."" “It’s a day-by-day journey for Jacqueline right now,” Brooker said. The Bishops have not apologized to her, he said. Durand seeks a jury trial and compensation of more than $1 million, the lawsuit said.",U.S./NBC News,"Texas dog walker permanently disfigured in 'bloodthirsty' attack by 2 dogs, lawsuit says",https://news.yahoo.com/texas-dog-walker-permanently-disfigured-220120317.html
1/28/2022,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — The most vulnerable members of the Wiyot Tribe were asleep the morning of Feb. 26, 1860, when a band of white men slipped into their Northern California villages under darkness and slaughtered them. Many of the children, women and elderly slain in what became known as the Indian Island Massacre had their eternal rest disturbed when their graves were later dug up and their skeletons and the artifacts buried with them were placed in a museum. After nearly 70 years of separation from their tribe, the remains of at least 20 of those believed to have been killed have been returned home. “They’re going to be at peace and at rest with our other ancestors,” Ted Hernandez, the Wiyot Tribe's historic preservation officer, said Tuesday after the repatriation was announced. “They’ll be able to reunite with their families.” The return is part of an effort by some institutions to do a better job complying with federal law that requires giving tribes back items looted from sacred burial sites. Grave robbing was yet another indignity suffered by Native Americans and their descendants long after they were driven from their lands or killed. Hobbyists, collectors and even prominent researchers took part in the desecration of burial sites. Skulls, bones and antiquities were sold, traded, studied and displayed in museums. Cutcha Risling Baldy, a professor of Native American studies at Humboldt State University, said returning the sacred items provides healing to tribes. She criticized museums and universities that warehouse items that objectify Native Americans and reduce them to historical objects and artifacts rather than people. “From a spiritual perspective, from a cultural perspective or even a human perspective, it’s hard to imagine the graves of your ancestors being dug up and then put into a museum,” Risling Baldy said. “It kind of creates a mythology around Native people that we are somehow specimens, rather than people and human beings.” The bones of the Wiyot were recovered in 1953 after being discovered near where a jetty was constructed outside the city of Eureka, 225 miles (362 kilometers) north of San Francisco, according to a notice last year in the Federal Register. A team from University of California, Berkeley collected the remains and put them in storage with 136 artifacts buried with them — mainly beads and ornaments made from shells, an arrowhead from a broken bottle fragment, a sinker for a fishing net, bone tools and an elk tooth. The gravesites were where the Wiyot buried some of their dead following a devastating series of mass slayings at a dozen of their villages over the course of a week in 1860. The unprovoked killings occurred in the midst of the tribe's World Renewal Ceremony, a 10-day peaceful celebration with food, dance and prayer to return balance to the Earth, Hernandez said. After the ceremony, the tribe's men left for the night, paddling from the island to the mainland to hunt and fish for food and gather firewood for the next day’s feast. In the early morning, raiders arrived by canoe across the bay and stabbed, beat or hacked the victims with knives, clubs and hatchets. Several other attacks were carried out that night, and more killings occurred over the next five days, said Jerry Rohde, a Humboldt County historian. More than 50 people were killed on the island, and as many as 500 may have been killed in the course of the week, Rohde said. An account in the New York Times put the death toll at 188. The group of vigilantes were dubbed the “Thugs"" but never named publicly or held accountable. A young Bret Harte, who would go on to become one of the most popular writers of the day, wrote a scathing editorial about the bloodshed in The Northern Californian, a newspaper in the city just to the north. “When the bodies were landed at Union, a more shocking and revolting spectacle never was exhibited to the eyes of a Christian and civilized people,” he wrote. But that was not the popular opinion in the area, Rohde said. The Humboldt Times editor had advocated for the removal or extermination of Native people. Harte fled to San Francisco after death threats. Some of the men bragged about the killings, and two others who were said to take part went on to be elected to the state Legislature, Rohde said. The Wiyot began seeking return of their ancestors in 2016 under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. The act made it illegal to steal from the graves and required government institutions to return items in their possession. But getting those back has not always been easy. UC Berkeley, which held the remains at the Hearst Museum of Anthropology, denied the request, citing lack of evidence, said Tom Torma, the university's repatriation coordinator. Torma was aware of the case because he submitted the request as the Wiyot's historical preservation officer at the time. A 2020 state audit found the University of California had an inconsistent policy in how it repatriated remains. While the University of California, Los Angeles had returned most eligible remains, Berkeley had returned only 20%. UC Berkeley, which houses remains of 10,000 Native Americans — the largest collection in the U.S. — also regularly required additional evidence that delayed returns, the audit said. The campus has had a racial reckoning with the past in recent years, including its history with Native Americans. Last year, the university stripped the name of Alfred Kroeber from the hall housing the anthropology department and museum. Kroeber, a pioneer in American anthropology, collected or authorized collection of Native Americans remains for research. He was best known for taking custody of Ishi, called “last of the Yahi,"" who emerged from the wilderness in 1911. The man performed as a living exhibit for museum visitors, demonstrating how to make stone tools and crafts. The university system revised its repatriation policy, based in part on input from tribes, last year. A new committee at UC Berkeley took a more proactive approach and determined there was enough evidence to return the Wiyot items, Torma said. The repatriation was jointly made with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which was responsible for the jetty construction that may have unearthed the remains. For the Wiyot Tribe, the repatriation last fall came two years after the island known now as Tulawat, was returned to the tribe by the city of Eureka. It's now up to tribal elders to determine what to do with the remains, Hernandez said. The dead are already a part of their ceremonies. When the dancing and praying is done, the sacred fires are left burning for their forebears. “They’ll be able to continue the ceremonies in the afterlife,” Hernandez said.",U.S./Associated Press,California museum returns massacre remains to Wiyot Tribe,https://news.yahoo.com/remains-massacred-ancestors-returned-wiyot-051143041.html
