1/20/2022,"There are few things Americans love more than a redemption arc. Throughout the Trump administration, cable news anchors and audiences have been fascinated by narratives of conservatives who could not stomach the wicked excess of Donald Trump. Case in point: CNN’s Jake Tapper reported on Tuesday that a small group of former Trump officials held a “conference call last Monday to discuss efforts to fend off his efforts to, in their view, erode the democratic process.” More from Rolling Stone New Evidence Shows Trump 'Personally Implicated' In Potential Fraud, Including Lying About the Size of His Manhattan Apartment Trump Caps MLK Day by Using Taxpayer-Funded Office to Promote Golf Course Renovations Florida Guys: Trump and DeSantis Are Done Playing Nice That sentence already seems a bit shaky. What, exactly, are these people doing? Tapper can’t say, and neither can they, apparently. “We’re still trying to figure out what it is” that we want to do, one participant told CNN. “Outcomes are key.” Per CNN, their plans “ranged from ‘shining a light’ on Trump’s corporate contributors to targeting for defeat in the primary or general election each individual Trump has endorsed for state and local races, although [ret. Gen. John] Kelly is reluctant to do anything that involves specifically endorsing any candidate.” So, “shining a light” on Trump’s web of swampy corruption that is already public, or potentially running ads for Republican primary challengers who don’t have the endorsement of the party’s most recent president … unless their most senior member says no. Off to a great start. Without any real news or concrete plans to highlight, CNN’s scoop largely focuses on the list of attendees who were on the call. The highest-ranking participant was former White House chief of staff and retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, who told CNN that because of a prior commitment he was only able to “monitor” about 10 minutes of the call, which lasted about an hour. Other participants included former Trump White House communications directors Alyssa Farah Griffin (now a CNN political commentator) and Anthony Scaramucci, former Homeland Security and counterterrorism adviser to Vice President Pence Olivia Troye, former Department of Homeland Security official Elizabeth Neumann, and former Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Chris Krebs, among others. Kelly, as Trump’s chief of staff, and Farrah Griffin and Scaramucci, as his PR muscle, were deeply complicit in Trump’s regime, while figures like Troye, Neumann, and Krebs were career GOP operators who found themselves in Trump’s orbit and have been more consistent in their criticisms of the administration. They all exist in a liminal space that’s like catnip for cable news — lifelong supporters of the conservative party’s goals, but squeamish at Trump’s uncouth methods. Former White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham, who laid some groundwork for this Trump Turncoat supergroup during an interview with CNN last week, missed the call because she had Covid, but is also participating. The group’s leader at the moment is Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security chief of staff. If that name sounds familiar, it’s because Taylor himself was the subject of a massive news cycle once he was revealed to be the author of the wildly viral New York Times op-ed “I Am Part of the Resistance Inside the Trump Administration.” Taylor wrote a cash-grab book based on the op-ed, which he parlayed into a paid spot as a CNN contributor in 2020. Most of these people, of course, voluntarily took jobs with the Trump administration, signing on to work for his regime well after Trump announced his presidential bid with a wave of open xenophobia and racism. The cold feet you’re seeing here has less to do with Trump’s personal politics than with these individuals’ careers. They’ve clearly made the call that associating with the country’s political center is a better long-term choice than doubling down on Trump-aligned extremism. And who knows, it could work – especially with a friendly media ecosystem designed to reward them for doing things like “scheduling a conference call.” But it’s highly unlikely that any of their actions will have a measurable impact on Republican politics, which is still firmly in Trump’s control. The former president is dominating every poll for their 2024 candidacy and has effectively swayed most state and national primaries he’s made an endorsement in. What all of this will do, of course, is keep these former Trump hands in the public eye and clean up their reputations enough that their participation in the Trump administration’s abhorrent politics won’t interfere with their future job prospects in the private sector or centrist politics. There’s an old adage about rats and sinking ships, and this group of little rodents has carefully determined it’s in their best interests to get their feet wet. What remains to be seen is how quickly they get back on board if the SS Trump stays afloat in 2024.

1/20/2022,"KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Five months into their rule of Afghanistan, the Taliban have increased revenue, cracked down on corruption and collected a surprising $1 billion in exports, the U.N. representative for the country said Wednesday. At the same time, Deborah Lyons, head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, stressed the need for the Taliban to be inclusive and guarantee the rights of minorities and women. “An economy thrives only when women and all segments of a society are equal participants,"" she cautioned. Lyons spoke at a one-day economic conference organized by the Taliban — their first such event, held at a time when Afghanistan teeters on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe and economic collapse. Kabul's assets abroad, mainly in the United States, have been frozen after the Taliban overran the country in mid-August. The international community has been hesitant to officially recognize a Taliban government, wary they could impose some of the same harsh measures as under their previous rule, 20 years ago. The downward spiral has thrown more than half a million people out of work according to a report by the International Labor Organization released on Wednesday. Women have been the hardest hit by the rise in unemployment. Companies are struggling to stay afloat as thousands of Afghans flee the country each day, the report said, warning of more dire prospects in 2022 as work becomes even more scarce. Women held about one in five jobs in Afghanistan in 2020, but are now being prevented from working in some areas. Education for girls has also been limited, though Taliban leaders have said they hope to be able to open all schools for girls across the country after late March. Still, Lyons touted some of the bright spots while also warning that humanitarian needs are enormous — 1 million children at the risk of starvation, nearly 90% of the population below the poverty level and hunger threatening two-thirds of Afghanistan. The U.N. has warned that 8.7 million Afghans are on the brink of starvation. “Exports have also reached the $1 billion mark for the first time ever, the payment of salaries to civil servants have been made,"" Lyons said, and lauded the Taliban for their new budget, solely “financed by national revenues and not dependent on any donor grants.” Representatives from humanitarian organizations and those from the diplomatic community still in Afghanistan also attended the conference as well as private business people, academics and Taliban Cabinet ministers. Taliban-appointed Prime Minister Mullah Mohammad Hasan Akhund chaired the meeting at the sprawling presidential palace in Kabul, a rare public appearance for him. In his speech, Akhund called for the release of Afghanistan's frozen assets, saying his administration is not asking for money. “The help that we are asking is not for the officials of the government, it is for the poor nation,” he said. Also in attendance was his deputy, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the lead negotiator in the 2020 deal with the United States that paved the way for the withdrawal of the last U.S. and NATO troops from Afghanistan. Taliban Finance Minister Mullah Hidayatullah Badri told the gathering that Afghanistan's economy needs the billions of dollars in assets frozen abroad. Calls for the release of the money have grown in recent weeks. U.S. Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders on Tuesday tweeted an appeal to President Joe Biden. “Afghanistan is facing a humanitarian catastrophe,"" Sanders tweeted. “I urge the Biden administration to immediately release billions in frozen Afghan government funds to help avert this crisis, and prevent the death of millions of people.” While saying that a reconciliation with the new Taliban rulers is critical to Afghanistan's economic survival, Lyons said the international community has had some success in getting additional liquidity into Afghanistan and even finding ways to allow the Taliban to pay some import bills, including for electricity. “Foremost among these advances is the adoption of a national budget that was for the first time totally financed by national revenues,” Lyons said. She attributed the increased revenues in large part to Taliban “efforts to curb corruption.” Previous U.S.-backed Afghan governments were dogged by widespread corruption. In 2020, Transparency International ranked Afghanistan among the world's most corrupt countries. Lyons said the Taliban have much to do to build and gain the trust of those who had worked for the previous government or even the multitude of Afghans, including many professionals, who have fled fearing the new rulers. The international community would remain committed to the Afghan people, Lyons added. “We are eager to continue to work with you to serve and support the people of Afghanistan,” she said. Meanwhile a former Taliban commander, Mohammad Amir, his son and two others were killed when gunmen opened fire on their car in northeaster Kunar province, according to Maulvi Najeebullah, provincial culture and information department chief. Seven people were also wounded in the attack, which he said was the result of a personal dispute.",World/Associated Press,Taliban economy conference in Kabul stresses need for funds,https://news.yahoo.com/taliban-economy-conference-kabul-stresses-164148810.html
