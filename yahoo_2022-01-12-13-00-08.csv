1/12/2022,"An attorney for one of the defendants in the alleged plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has launched a direct attack on the credibility of the prosecution, claiming it misrepresented its knowledge of the actions of a key FBI informant whom it recently disparaged as a rogue “double agent.” The informant, Stephen Robeson, was accused last week by prosecutors of disobeying FBI rules and undermining the investigation into an alleged conspiracy to kidnap Whitmer and try her for treason. Among Robeson’s offenses, they claimed, was “offering use of 501(c) charity funds to purchase weapons for attacks.” But according to a new filing Tuesday by the attorney for defendant Adam Fox, the FBI was well aware that Robeson had made such offers. The filing includes a transcript of an August 2020 recording — listened to by two of the lead FBI agents in the probe — in which another informant tells Fox that the charity was used to purchase weapons. “While the Government attempts to minimize his involvement and its knowledge of the same,” the attorney, Christopher Gibbons, wrote, “the FBI maintained an intimate knowledge and control of [Robeson] and his activities.” A spokesperson for the FBI declined to comment on the matter, referring inquiries to the Justice Department. A spokesperson for the US Attorney’s Office in the Western District of Michigan also declined to comment, citing official policy to not discuss ongoing criminal matters. The five men facing federal trial in the case claim that they were entrapped by the government — and in particular by Robeson and another FBI informant, both of whom worked to recruit potential suspects, organize events such as the surveillance of Gov. Whitmer’s vacation home, and make hundreds of hours of clandestine recordings. The defendants also contend that there was no true conspiracy to kidnap anyone, and that the only planning was done by the FBI and its operatives. Prosecutors have pushed back, arguing that the defendants were predisposed to take violent action against the governor because of the strict COVID policies she had implemented. But they have also asked the judge to sharply limit the evidence that can be admitted into court when the trial begins March 8. They have, for example, said that they will not call three lead FBI agents in the case, and argued that many of the statements those men made during the course of the investigation should not be allowed as evidence. And last week they said that because of his misconduct, statements by Robeson should also be kept out of the courtroom. Robeson, who had been convicted of multiple felonies dating back to the early 1980s, began work for the FBI on Oct. 20, 2019, new evidence disclosed in Tuesday’s filing reveals, and was terminated as a confidential informant on Oct. 28, 2020, three weeks after the defendants in the Michigan case were arrested. The FBI paid him $19,328.79 for his work, the new evidence shows, and he helped organize at least four events that the government highlighted as critical in the evolution of the alleged conspiracy, even going so far as to pay for pizza, “moonshine,” and hotel rooms for attendees. While he was still working on the case, Robeson acquired a .50 caliber sniper rifle despite prohibitions on gun ownership by people with felony convictions. He was indicted last March in federal court on the gun charge and agreed to a plea deal in September. That deal, which offered him no jail time despite his extensive record and a statutory maximum sentence of 10 years, was an extremely favorable one — particularly if, as prosecutors now allege, they knew he had been secretly working “against the interests of the government.” Last month, Robeson was charged again, this time in Wisconsin state court. Notably, he is alleged to have defrauded a couple out of an SUV by convincing them it was going to a charity he controlled. Investigators found that there was no such charity and that Robeson had simply kept the vehicle for his own use. That fraud is alleged to have taken place during the same month that the two FBI agents overheard the conversation about Robeson’s use of a charity to acquire weaponry. In their filing last Thursday, prosecutors called Robeson a “noncompliant informant,” saying he undertook a number of “unauthorized acts,” including offering the charity funds, obtaining weapons, and offering to use a drone “to aid in acts of terrorism.” They also claim he failed to record certain events he was supposed to be informing the FBI about, attempted to destroy other evidence, and warned at least one defendant that he’d been approached by the government. Citing those reasons, prosecutors took the unusual step of arguing that his statements and actions while working for the FBI should be excluded from the case. In Tuesday’s filing, Gibbons challenged that argument. “The Government consistently relied on a specific cadre of agents and confidential informants from as early as October 2019 to October of 2020 in establishing its case against these defendants. The Government now seeks to distance itself from the very same group agents and informants, and their inconvenient actions and statements during the upcoming jury trial.” A hearing on what evidence will be admitted at trial is scheduled for next Tuesday in federal court.

1/12/2022,"The world, after all, looks different today than it did last year: Namely, there were 4 million new COVID cases reported in America last week — a caseload it took the country a whopping 6 months to amass in 2020. Giphy / Via media.giphy.com Experts I interviewed told me they're alarmed that “COVID response fatigue” — as one doctor put it — has caused Americans to become complacent against the virus when vigilance is as needful as ever. By now, we all know that COVID-19 is relentless and refuses to give any of us the chance to catch our breath. Having already endured new waves of the virus crashing immediately behind previous ones and witnessing the devastating effects from variants such as Delta, the country is now battling the most contagious strain of the virus yet: Omicron. ""Omicron appears to be much more infectious than prior variants,"" said Dr. Scott Wetstone, an associate professor of public health sciences at UConn Health at the University of Connecticut. Indeed, former CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden recently posted to Twitter that in his 30 years of studying infectious disease outbreaks, ""I've NEVER seen anything like the speed of Omicron."" Despite its unprecedented spread and danger, a whopping 37.4% of the country remains unvaccinated, with those unvaccinated individuals making up the vast majority of COVID-related hospitalizations. Dr. Julie Smith-Gagen, an epidemiologist at the University of Nevada, Reno, told me her sister-in-law's father couldn't receive adequate treatment for the chest pains he was experiencing because his hospital was ""overwhelmed with unvaccinated sick people."" She said, ""He spent time in the hospital hallway and passed away a few days later."" Wetstone lamented that Omicron could push our healthcare system ""past its breaking point"" and that ""patients needing care for matters other than COVID won't get it."" ""It's unfortunate that people with various illnesses including cancers have to delay their care because unvaccinated patients with COVID are overwhelming the system,"" said Dr. Josef Neu, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Florida. ""This is unacceptable when in most cases vaccination could have prevented this."" ""A more transmissible virus like Omicron will lead to more cases, hospitalizations, and unfortunately more deaths,"" warned Dr. Katrine Wallace, an epidemiologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, School of Public Health. ""We should try to use as many mitigation layers as possible in light of a more transmissible variant."" While there are many proven layers of mitigation in the fight against this virus, few are more effective (or controversial) than face masks. Despite bungled messaging by authorities early on, masks have continually proven to be one of the best tools we have at our disposal. One of the most recent global studies found that masks are linked to a whopping 53% decrease in transmission when worn properly. N95 masks or surgical masks have proven to be especially effective. ""Several studies have found that surgical masks are between 66% and 70% effective,"" Dr. Smith-Gagen said. Dr. Hyung Chun, an associate professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine, said he can speak from firsthand experience about how effective face masks are in protecting against COVID transmission. ""I rode in a car for almost an hour with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 the next day but I did not catch the virus,"" he said. ""We were both masked with regular surgical masks throughout our ride.""  ""Not only does masking prevent the spread of COVID, but also many other infectious diseases that are spread during this time of year,"" said Dr. Joseph Larkin, a microbiologist at the University of Florida. He also pointed out that wearing masks in crowds is nothing new: ""In countries such as Japan, masks have been respectfully used to prevent the spread of infectious agents for many years."" While masks are useful, vaccines and boosters remain the most important layer of protection against COVID and its variants. ""I would strongly recommend vaccination for anyone who is indicated for it,"" Dr. Abraham said. ""Without vaccinations in the US, some estimates suggest greater than one million more people would have died during the beginning of the pandemic,"" said Dr. Neu. ""Nearly 8.47 billion and 495 million doses have been administered across the world and the United States, respectively. At this point, the vaccine has been proven to be safe and effective across multiple situations and demographics including in older adults, children/adolescents, pregnant women, individuals who are immunocompromised, and individuals with chronic medical conditions,"" said Dr. Richard Dang, a pharmacist and assistant professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Southern California. ""Think of it this way,"" she said, ""putting gas into a 12-year-old Hyundai sedan will make it work, but won't turn the car into a brand-new Ferrari. Just because we are vaccinated doesn't necessarily mean that we won't get COVID; it just means our body has more tools to fight the virus if we do."" ""The overall vaccine effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines against Alpha and Delta ranged from 80% to 100%,"" Dang said. ""Based on some data that just came out of the United Kingdom, vaccine effectiveness against Omicron infection was reduced to 30%–40% after only 2 doses, but increased back up to 70%–80% after a booster dose."" Dr. Megan Quinn, an associate professor in the department of biostatistics and epidemiology at the College of Public Health at East Tennessee State University explained that anyone concerned about vaccines should keep rare side effects in proper perspective alongside the risks of contracting the diseases they protect against. Generally, only 1 in 200,000 people have a serious adverse — though nonlethal — reaction to COVID-19 vaccines compared to 1 in 150 who die after contracting the virus. ""The benefits of vaccines have been found to far outweigh the risks,"" she said.  ""Though T-cell responses aren't as easy to quantitate as antibodies,"" he said, ""they are also very important because they help reactivate the antibody response and, when necessary, prevent cells that are infected from infecting other cells."" He explained that our immune system is like a heavyweight boxer that may be capable of beating a virus like COVID, but it still has to train for each specific opponent (getting vaxxed) and remain fit enough to endure multiple rounds and new contenders (boosting against variants). In January 2022, the CDC updated its recommendation to shorten the interval between one's second dose and a booster from 6 months to 5 months for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. The general rule of thumb now is ""the booster shot should be given anytime 5 months or greater after your second shot,"" Dr. Borrell said.  However, per the CDC, ""for people who received the J&J vaccine (2 months) or the Moderna vaccine (6 months),"" the interval has not changed. ""Individuals who have been infected with COVID-19 have likely developed antibodies through natural immunity,"" Dang acknowledged. ""However, it is currently unknown how long protection through these antibodies may last."" He added that anyone with a previous infection of COVID-19 should still get the shots once their symptoms have abated. ""Multiple studies show that individuals who have previously been infected with COVID-19 still benefit from the vaccine and boosters, especially in reducing the risk of reinfections and protection against severe disease or hospitalizations,"" he said. Dr. Jesse Erasmus, a microbiologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine, had similar advice. ""Even those who have experienced natural infection should get a booster. These individuals will likely have an ideal immune response to the booster vaccination with potential for an improved breadth of immunity, which could provide better protection against future variants,"" he said.  Most young people can beat COVID without dying but something as simple as staying up to date with vaccination and boosters could save you a trip to the hospital and a world of hurt. ""While there is a general perception that COVID-19 causes severe disease only in the elderly population, we have seen many unvaccinated patients in their 30s to 50s being hospitalized in the intensive care units with COVID-19 infections,"" said Dr. Chun.  What's more, Dr. Abraham said, ""Another reason to get vaccinated is to protect your neighbors and family, and be a good citizen. Each and every one of us would feel terrible if we passed on COVID to a vulnerable friend or family member."" While the future of COVID-19 is still unknown, most public health officials told me they think it would be wise to recalibrate one's expectations about COVID vaccines and boosters from the ""one and done"" mentality to annual doses becoming likely. ""I anticipate seasonal outbreaks and hopefully effective boosters to control the spread and severity of the disease,"" said Dr. John Hokanson, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Colorado School of Public Health. ""COVID vaccines will be similar to the flu vaccine,"" Dr. Borrell offered. ""Every year (or sooner), we may have to get it. Thus, we should get used to it.""  The good news is that because we have so many mitigation tools at our disposal, the panic that gripped the nation in 2020 is preventable. ""We should be concerned and remain responsible, but not become irrational due to high anxiety,"" Dr. Larkin advised. ""Of course, these are challenging, unprecedented times, but we have to continue to do the things we can. This includes getting vaccinated, getting boosters, and masking."" The US is reporting record increases in COVID-19 cases and related hospitalizations right now, which is at least partly due to the highly contagious new variant Omicron. The CDC maintains that getting vaccinated against COVID-19 is the best way to protect yourself and those around you from severe illness.

1/12/2022,"Republican congressman Matt Gaetz wants to stop the music this weekend in Florida, when it comes to the 30A Songwriters Festival, an annual gathering that he contends is acting as a scofflaw when it comes to COVID restrictions — by having any at all. Gaetz has written an open letter to Florida governor Ron De Santis over what the congressman says is “the illegal implementation of vaccine passports” at the festival, asking him to “inform the Walton County Tourist Development Council of the ramifications if they proceed in funding the 30A Songwriters Festival under these unlawful conditions.” More from Variety Matt Gaetz Speaks at 'Free Britney' Rally, Decrying 'Grifters' and Urging Federal Legislation for Conservatorships Brian Williams Bashes Rep. Matt Gaetz Over Military and Critical Race Theory Critiques House Republicans Seek Hearing on Britney Spears' Conservatorship to #FreeBritney But 30A organizers tell Variety they aren’t imposing any more onerous restrictions than the most basic ones happening at virtually every other concert in the area, and that these hardly constitute the so-called “vaccine passport” that has become a bogeyman of the right. Rep. Gaetz “did not verify anything with us” before issuing a press release, says Russell Carter, who co- produces the 30A Songwriters Festival with Jennifer Steele for the non-profit Cultural Arts Alliance of Walton County. “He just ranted about Vaccine Passports, which we do not nor ever have advocated or required.” 30A, scheduled for Friday through Sunday, is due to feature singer-songwriters like Emmylou Harris, Jenny Lewis, Dawes, Patty Griffin, Rickie Lee Jones, Allison Moorer, Mavis Staples, Hayes Carll and dozens more familiar to the folk-rock or Americana communities. (See a full lineup here.) Carter maintains that the festival policy, which is to require proof of vaccination or a recent negative COVID-18 test for attendees, is well in line with Florida law. Gov. DeSantis, who is like-minded with Gaetz in being against virtually all COVID-related restrictions, did sign off last spring on a bill making it illegal to require vaccine proof as a requirement to enter a business. But in Florida and the other 19 Republican-governed states where such laws have been passed, concert and live theater promoters have generally been understood to be in the clear as long as their primary requirement is a negative test, with proof of vaccination being a way of opting out of the test mandate. In a statement issued to Variety Tuesday night, Gaetz said: “The policy of the 30A Songwriters Festival is to subject unvaccinated Floridians to different screening than the vaccinated. This is a dangerous, slippery slope. Governor DeSantis has repeatedly made clear that it will be unlawful to treat these groups differently in any way, and we agree with him.” In his open letter to the governor issued earlier, Gaetz said that “vaccine passports should not be funded by Florida taxpayers,” and that what 30A requires for admission is “a blatant violation of Executive Order 21-81, ‘Prohibiting COVID-19 Vaccine Passports.’ … Your executive order allows entities to engage in COVID-19 screening, generally, but does not permit different treatment for the vaccinated and unvaccinated.” 30A’s position is that the unvaccinated are equally as welcome at the festival as the vaccinated, as long as they can provide a negative test from within the previous 72 hours, something that DeSantis’ office has signaled an OK on in the past. “Rep. Gaetz is no stranger to the 30A Songwriters Festival,” Carter says. “He represents Walton County where the Festival is produced every MLK holiday weekend in January. His office has on many occasions contacted the festival requesting complimentary tickets, and he has attended the Festival at least twice in recent years. Prior to sending and publishing a letter to Gov. DeSantis, he easily could have called us to clarify what our policy is or researched it by going to our website to verify there is in fact no Vaccine Passport. Instead he quite simply misrepresented the facts in an irresponsible manner.” Carter quoted the festival’s printed language: “All Festival Patrons MUST present a negative COVID test (within the previous 72 hours), along with a valid government-issued photo ID, to receive a 30A SONGWRITERS FESTIVAL wristband. (Note: Festival Patrons may choose to present proof of full vaccination in lieu of a negative test).” The producer went on to say the governor’s office had signed off on that language, and to quote the governor’s press secretary, Christina Pushaw, as saying: “SB 2006 only prohibits businesses from requiring proof of vaccination from customers as a condition of entry or service. If concert-goers can provide a negative COVID test instead of a vaccine passport, that is acceptable under the law. People who want to show proof of vaccination instead of a COVID test are free to do that. It just cannot be compelled.” Added Carter: “Our festival is a benefit for the non-profit Cultural Arts Alliance of Walton County. The festival raises hundreds of thousands of dollars each year for the arts group. It also generates over $8 million in revenue to the resorts, hotels, bars, restaurants, rental home companies and other small businesses throughout the county. … We bring ‘hooks, lines, and singers’ to 30A. The music begins begins Friday at 4 p.m. — come join us.” Variety was not immediately able to reach Gaetz’s reps for comment.
