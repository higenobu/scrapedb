1/26/2022,"On Monday evening on the dot of 7pm people emerged from dimly lit side streets and gathered on the Oberkirchplatz square in Cottbus for what has become a weekly ritual in towns and cities across Germany: a protest against coronavirus protection measures. The demonstrations have grown in strength as cases of the Omicron variant have surged, and in recent weeks a looming decision on bringing in a vaccine mandate has become the focus of protesters’ ire. More than 2,000 rallies were held nationwide on Monday, drawing tens of thousands of participants.  In Cottbus, a university city south-east of Berlin, a familiar pattern played out. Moments after the protest started, police declared over megaphone that it was illegal – the participants did not wear masks or physically distance from each other. Groups then broke away and began the Spaziergänge, walks that snake in a variety of directions and are designed to overwhelm any police response. Dressed in padded coats and woolly hats, the protesters were an inconspicuous crowd. “We are just having an evening stroll,” one woman smirked amiably from under a red woollen beret. “Exercising our right to stretch our legs.” The gentle click of heels and umbrella studs on wet cobbled stones was quickly drowned out, however, by a man who bellowed “Frieden, Freiheit, keine Diktatur!” (Peace, freedom, no dictatorship) then “Widerstand!” (Resistance). A woman nearby took up the cry with “Wir sind das Volk!” (We are the people) – the chant that echoed around cities across communist east Germany in 1989 before the fall of the Berlin Wall. Those willing to talk mostly said they wanted to show local and national politicians they had had enough of restrictions. Several said they were not vaccinated; some refused to say. Hardly any were willing to reveal their names. “I just want my freedom back,” said one elderly woman. Another younger woman said she was trying to stop the government from forcibly vaccinating her nine-year-old, though there is currently no plan to oblige parents to have children vaccinated. A physiotherapist, one of the few protesters who was wearing a mask, said she was fearful of losing her job if she refuses to get vaccinated under plans for a mandate for medical staff, due to be introduced next month. Asked why there was need for resistance, Maik, a landscape gardener who refused to wear a mask – calling them “chin nappies” – said: “When injustice becomes law, resistance is our duty.” There is growing evidence that the protests are being manipulated behind the scenes by rightwing populists and far-right groups, who see issues such as restrictions on gatherings, insistence on the wearing of medical masks as well as a possible vaccine mandate for adults as topics ripe for political exploitation. Zukunft Heimat (Future Homeland), a far-right group founded in 2015 at the height of the refugee crisis that spreads a nationalist, anti-refugee message, coordinates much of the activity around demonstrations in the state of Brandenburg, including Cottbus. Ahead of Monday’s rallies, it posted a message from one of its co-founders, Christoph Berndt, a dentist who is also the parliamentary leader of the far-right populist AfD in Brandenburg and has been a speaker at anti-refugee Pegida rallies. He called on people to “defend our freedom and our democracy …” against a government which is “treating its citizens with disdain”. Berndt has previously questioned whether anyone has died of Covid, said he does not believe the virus exists, and refused to wear a mask because it is a “symbol of suppression”. On chat rooms and in conversations on messaging apps about the rallies, people talk about wanting to topple the government, comparing the administration to a dictatorship. Those who once rallied against the former chancellor, Angela Merkel, over her refugee policy now rail against her successor, Olaf Scholz, and his health minister, Karl Lauterbach. Some refer, online and in person – with what generally appears as glee – to a conspiracy theory called Tag X (Day X) that predicts Germany’s “entire system” will collapse due to critical infrastructure being disabled by quarantine measures. Rally participants are encouraged to “put sand into the cogs of a system” already perceived to be on its last legs, and lighthearted references are made to a “civil war mood”. At the time of the refugee crisis, rightwing extremists linked to the far-right Identitarian movement, the rightwing-focused advertising agency One Per Cent and the thinktank Institut für Staatspolitik (IfS) built a digital map, showing the location of anti-Islam protests across Germany. People could put in their postcode and find their nearest rally. A similar map has been produced for the coronavirus “Spaziergang” movement, created by the far-right association Filmkunstkollektiv, whose members and supporters include Identitarians, members of the IfS, and One Per Cent. Filmkunstkollektiv is also known to have produced film material for the AfD, recently accompanying its youth wing on a “vaccine strike” in Berlin. It also has an association with the far-right Compact magazine, whose latest cover depicts a young man with needles and syringes embedded in his body, under the title “Vaccine dictatorship – being boosted to death”. Much of the wind for the protests has come from neighbouring Austria, where plans for a vaccine mandate and the fightback against it are more inflamed. There, the founder of the Identitarian movement, Martin Sellner, has referred to vaccine passports and fines as “totalitarian instruments”. This mindset was reflected in some of the protesters on Monday night, even those who declared themselves “apolitical”. In a chat group on an instant messaging service that provides a running commentary of the Monday protests, an unvaccinated woman wrote that since she has had to to abide by rules that ban those not vaccinated or recovered from many non-essential activities, “it is possible to put oneself in the shoes of Jews who suddenly had their basic rights removed from them during the Third Reich”. Such remarks have been widely condemned. Experts on Germany’s constitution have warned that the victimhood narrative expressed by many of the protesters is in danger of being exploited by extremist elements. They cite the murder last September of a petrol pump attendant shot by a man after he refused to serve him for not wearing a mask as proof that they are not exaggerating. Less than an hour into the rally in Cottbus on Monday night, the several hundred peaceful protesters were playing a game of cat and mouse with the police, who managed to kettle in one group next to a Glühwein kiosk. There were some wild theories doing the rounds. A primary school teacher called Brigitte, walking with a group of friends towards the old market square, said she gave credence to a theory that the vaccine campaign is “an attempt to thin out the world’s population”. The 73% of Germans who are vaccinated are supposed to die, she said. “If this is the case, then I am one of the 26% who will live to make this nation great again.” Asked what the source for the theory was, she replied she “read it on one of my newsfeeds”.",News/World news,"‘Peace, freedom, no dictatorship!’: Germans protest against Covid restrictions ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/25/peace-freedom-no-dictatorship-germans-protest-against-covid-restrictions

1/26/2022,"Boris Johnson has hinted that Germany was concerned about the imposition of sanctions against Russia because of its dependance on Russian gas and told MPs diplomatic efforts were being made to persuade Berlin and others to go further. The British prime minister said that “European friends” had concerns about imposing the toughest possible sanctions on Russia if it invades Ukraine because of their “heavy dependance” on Russian gas – and also declared the UK would be willing to deploy more troops to eastern Europe if Ukraine was attacked.  Johnson was giving a statement to MPs a day after an evening call between western leaders, including the US president, Joe Biden, German chancellor, Olof Scholz, and French president, Emmanuel Macron. “I think the house needs to understand that one of the big issues that we all face in dealing with Ukraine, in dealing with Russia, is the heavy dependence of our European friends in particular on Russian gas,” Johnson said. “It was clear in the conversations last night that, in this era of high gas prices, we are bumping up against that reality. “So the job of our diplomacy now is to persuade and encourage our friends to go as far as they can to sort this out and to come up with a tough package of economic sanctions because that is what this situation requires,” the prime minister added. Johnson was responding to a question from SNP leader Ian Blackford. The prime minister had initially said that western allies were still talking about cutting off Russia from the Swift banking global payments system in the event of an invasion. “I’m afraid it can only really be deployed with the assistance of the United States, though. We’re in discussions about that.” However, over the weekend Germany’s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock, had expressed doubts about the idea. British Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, said Russia should be hit with “widespread and hard-hitting sanctions” that must include cutting its access to the international financial system. He also called on Johnson to prevent Britain being used to launder Russian money: “If we take our obligations to global security seriously we cannot go on allowing ourselves to be the world’s laundromat for illicit finance.” Other participants on the evening video call were the leaders of Italy, Poland, the European Union and Nato. Germany relies on Russia for about a third of its gas supplies, while Johnson said the UK imported around 3%. The plan, Johnson said, was to impose “coordinated and severe economic sanctions heavier than anything we have done before against Russia” – and that efforts were going on in “finalising these measures as swiftly as possible in order to maximise their deterrent effect”. Sanctions would target both prominent individuals and Russian companies, Johnson added in a later answer to Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat. Britain would also be willing to deploy more troops to eastern Europe, if Russia were to invade. “We would look to contribute to any new Nato deployments,” the prime minister said. On Monday, the US said it would put 8,500 troops on high alert to deploy to Europe if necessary, while France said it was willing to send forces to Romania. In response, Russia said it was watching with great concern. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov accused Washington of fuelling tensions over Ukraine – repeating Moscow’s line that the crisis is being driven by US and Nato actions rather than by its own build-up of an estimated 100,000 troops near the Ukrainian border.",News/Politics,Johnson hints German reliance on Russian gas could affect Ukraine response,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/25/johnson-hints-german-reliance-on-russian-gas-could-affect-ukraine-response
1/26/2022,"With Boris Johnson reeling, the House of Commons was a stormy place at prime minister’s questions last Wednesday. The impact on the prime minister’s fate was minutely scrutinised. As a result, a separate exchange during that session has had less attention than it deserves. In one of his questions, Keir Starmer began talking about the contrast, widely highlighted in the media beforehand, between the Queen sitting alone, obeying Covid rules at her husband’s funeral, and staff at No 10 ignoring the rules while partying with colleagues the previous evening.  You might think this was a reasonable point for a parliamentarian to make. But no. For at this point the Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle intervened and told MPs: “We normally would not, and quite rightly, mention the royal family. We do not get into discussions on the royal family.” Reprimanded, Starmer moved on to his next question. Why did the Speaker do this? Why do “we” – the House of Commons – normally not mention the royal family? And why is this restraint, in the Speaker’s view, apparently “quite right”? Here, surely, is a conversation this country should have. The convention is dubious, absurd and not a little hypocritical. It is ripe for reform. We should be clear. What the Speaker told Starmer last week was not some idiosyncratic assertion. His intervention was institutional, not personal. He was restating established practice as set out in the Commons procedural bible, Erskine May. Hoyle was also saying exactly what three former Westminster clerks had told me a few days earlier that he would say if an MP ever tried to ask a question about either the monarch or the royal family – or specifically challenged the behaviour and official standing of Prince Andrew, the Duke of York. Erskine May is an accumulation of procedural evolution and convention – not a law book. It states that to use the Queen’s name to influence a decision is “unconstitutional in principle and inconsistent with the independence of parliament”. The rule extends to mention of other members of the royal family too. If a royal has expressed an opinion – as Prince Charles has often done – then comment “in appropriate terms” is permitted, but as the Speaker showed last week, the boundaries are carefully policed. The ostensible justification for what the Speaker said was that questions to ministers can deal only with matters of ministerial responsibility. Since no minister answers to parliament for the royal family, the subject is off-limits. And yet it wasn’t always like this. In 1809 – before Erskine May was codified – the Commons held an inquiry into the conduct of another Duke of York, who resigned as commander in chief of the army as a result. Nor does it mean, even in 2021, that no minister has responsibility for the royal family. Because they do. In reality, the prime minister has that role as the Queen’s chief adviser (arguably the chancellor of the exchequer and the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster have responsibilities too). The prime minister advises the Queen on all sorts of subjects, including the royal family itself, and ultimately he or she will advise her on her own conduct. Examples in fairly recent times stretch from what is still the most dramatic of them all, the abdication of Edward VIII in 1936, through Princess Margaret’s relationship with Peter Townsend in the 1950s, the royal divorces in the late 20th century, the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, and whether Prince Charles should marry Camilla Parker Bowles. Prime ministers have been involved in advising on all of these cases. In one or two cases, they have even given brief statements to the Commons about them. Indeed it is a reasonable bet that Johnson will have advised the Queen on both the withdrawal from public life of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex in 2020 and the handling of Prince Andrew’s position in the Virginia Giuffre case in recent weeks. It is strange but true that the partying prime minister is likely to have given his advice, or had his advice sought by the Palace, on whether the partying prince should be stripped of his honours. Yet why not? Andrew’s conduct raises the danger of reputational damage to the royal family and to the constitutional monarchy, and thus to Britain’s standing. A prime minister ought to be concerned about that. So, by the same yardstick, ought MPs. They should therefore be able to ask the prime minister about his role and advice, and to express their own views. These are, after all, matters of public interest as well as matters of interest to the public. All of this raises a much larger question for British democracy. Since we are a constitutional monarchy – and proud of it, in the majority of cases – how can it be that our parliament is gagged – and is gagging itself – from talking about how that constitutional monarchy is actually working? The effect is self-important self-censorship. A lot of this is about deference to the 95-year-old Queen, who is hugely respected. Yet once the Queen dies the same deference may not be seamlessly carried forward. It may even disappear. The idea that in the “new” monarchy, after the Queen’s death, the public will continue to feel constrained from talking about the royal family in the same way is likely to be false. We should all – parliament included – prepare to have these conversations more openly. We are adults, entitled to discuss the kind of constitutional monarchy under which we live, entitled to discuss what it stands for (not least in terms of the established religion), and who is and is not part of it. This happens in other monarchies, but not ours. It ought to start here too, and now, because decisions about the slimmed-down firm that is reportedly planned by Princes Charles and William will in many cases have been taken already. Even if Charles was to announce such changes on his accession, the Speaker would probably still be advising that MPs could not express their views. This is plain silly. The Speaker is wrong. It is time for parliament to stand up for itself. It is time for the party leaders and senior backbenchers – people such as Peter Bottomley, Harriet Harman, David Davis and Joanna Cherry – to get together and find a way to let the sunshine in.

1/26/2022,"Alabama Republicans illegally discriminated against Black voters when they drew the state’s seven new congressional districts last year and must quickly redraw the plan, a federal court has ruled.  The ruling is hugely consequential, a blunt assessment of the way lawmakers use their power to draw district lines to dilute the influence of Black and other minority voters. Pending lawsuits in North Carolina and Texas similarly allege that lawmakers illegally drew districts on the basis of race. About a quarter of Alabama’s population is Black but there is only one congressional district in the state where Black voters make up a majority. Plaintiffs who sued in September argued it was possible to draw a second district where Black voters made up a sizable enough portion to elect the candidate of their choice. A three-judge panel agreed on Monday, saying the state plan probably violated section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. That provision of the law outlaws voting practices that discriminate on the basis of race. “Black voters have less opportunity than other Alabamians to elect candidates of their choice to Congress,” Stanley Marcus, a judge on the US court of appeals for the 11th circuit, wrote for an unanimous panel. “​​The appropriate remedy is a congressional redistricting plan that includes either an additional majority Black congressional district, or an additional district in which Black voters otherwise have an opportunity to elect a representative of their choice.” Marcus, who was appointed by Bill Clinton, was joined in the opinion by Anna Manasco and Terry Moorer, both nominated by Donald Trump. The Alabama attorney general, Steve Marshall, a Republican, said the state would appeal to the US supreme court. The panel ordered state lawmakers to come up with a new plan in 14 days, and pushed back the deadline for qualifying for the ballot from 28 January to 11 February. If Republican lawmakers cannot come up with a new plan in that time, the court said it would appoint a special master to draw one. The seventh congressional district in Alabama, which stretches from Birmingham to the rural Black Belt, has consistently elected a Black Democrat to Congress for 30 years. Nearly 56% of the voting-age population in the district is Black. The state’s other six districts have all been represented by white Republicans. The plaintiffs in the case, including four voters, two state senators and several civil rights groups, argued that Alabama Republicans packed as many Black voters into the district as possible – about a third of Alabama’s Black population – in order to weaken their influence in other district across the state. The new map also split Black communities elsewhere in the state, to dilute the influence of Black voters. “It’s past time for Alabama to move beyond its sordid history of racial discrimination at the polls, and to listen to and be responsive to the needs and concerns of voters of color,” Tish Gotell Faulks, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama, said in a statement. The case is likely to be the first redistricting case the supreme court considers in this redistricting cycle, a process which occurs once every 10 years. While the supreme court has said it can do nothing to stop partisan gerrymandering, district plans that make it harder for minority voters to elect the candidate of their choosing remain illegal under the Voting Rights Act. Nicholas Stephanopolous, a professor at Harvard who studies redistricting, tweeted that the case offered a “textbook” example of the kind of discrimination outlawed by the Voting Rights Act. “If this doesn’t violate section 2, nothing does,” he said.",News/US news,"Alabama electoral maps discriminate against Black voters, federal court rules",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/25/alabama-electoral-maps-discriminate-black-voters-federal-court-rules
1/26/2022,"Scottish office workers will be allowed to return to their desks from Monday 31 January after Nicola Sturgeon lifted strict guidance urging non-essential staff to work from home. The first minister asked employers, in an update to MSPs at Holyrood, to begin a phased return to work by introducing hybrid working next week after a continuing decline in Omicron variant cases in Scotland.  Sturgeon also announced an easing of face mask rules from Friday, to allow people not wearing face coverings, such as church ministers, to stand 1 metre away from other people rather than 2 metres. Adults will also no longer be required to wear face coverings for parties or indoor events for children under five from Friday. School pupils must still wear face coverings in class, however, despite calls from the Conservatives and others for that regulation to be lifted. Sturgeon said cases numbers among children under 15 had grown 41% in Scotland since the return of schools, despite significant reductions in all other age groups. Sturgeon has faced pressure from businesses and opposition parties to lift Scotland’s stricter Covid measures, which heavily hit spending in shops, bars and restaurants during the Christmas and Hogmanay holidays. While the first minister said the tougher rules were proportionate and had helped suppress the Omicron wave far more effectively than in England, business leaders estimated they had cut spending by £1bn and were unnecessarily strict. Sturgeon said: “We would not expect to see a wholesale return to the office next week – indeed, given that the level of infection, though falling, remains high, a mass return at this stage is likely to set progress back. But we know there are many benefits to both employees and employers, and to the economy as a whole, in at least a partial return to the office at this stage.” Douglas Ross, the Scottish Conservative leader, said Sturgeon was still unnecessarily controlling what people could do. “While some people will still want to work from home, why doesn’t the first minister leave that decision up to employers and workers?” he asked. “What does she think this means for the many businesses who rely on workers being in the office and back in our town and city centres?” Sturgeon told MSPs that while coronavirus was unpredictable, the latest data showed the Omicron surge had clearly subsided. On Monday strict caps on numbers for outdoor events, a ban on nightclubs and requirements for face coverings, 1-metre distancing and table service in bars were lifted. In the week to 21 January, 704 people were admitted to hospital with Covid, compared with 1,026 in the previous week. The number of Covid-positive people in intensive care had fallen to from 49 from 59 people last Tuesday.",News/UK news,Scotland to relax strict work-from-home guidance from Monday,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/25/scotland-to-relax-strict-work-from-home-guidance-from-monday
1/26/2022,"English cricket has come under fresh criticism for its attitudes towards racism and “outdated” stereotypes after the chairman of Middlesex, Mike O’Farrell, told parliament that the sport’s lack of diversity was down to black players preferring football and rugby and the Asian community prioritising education. Azeem Rafiq and Ebony Rainford-Brent were among those to express their disbelief after O’Farrell suggested to a digital, culture, media and sport select committee hearing that it wasn’t cricket’s fault that more players from ethnic communities weren’t playing the game.  “The other thing in the diversity bit is that the football and rugby world becomes much more attractive to the Afro-Caribbean community,” explained O’Farrell. “And in terms of the south Asian community, we’re finding that they do not want necessarily to commit the same time that is necessary to go to the next step because they sometimes prefer to go into other educational fields, and then cricket becomes secondary,” he added. “Part of that is because it’s a rather more time-consuming sport than some others. So we’re finding that’s difficult.” O’Farrell’s comments were similar to those made by former FA chairman Greg Clarke, who was forced to resign after telling the same committee in 2020 that south Asian people choose careers in IT over sport. And they were immediately condemned by Rafiq, who gave explosive evidence to the same DCMS select committee in November where he described the game as “institutionally racist’”. “This has just confirmed what an endemic problem the game has,” he tweeted. “I actually can’t believe what I am listening to #GiveMeStrength.” He later told Sky Sports: “Listening to some of his narratives, I’ve got a message for him: we all love cricket. This narrative that we’ve been hearing for a long time about the Asian people wanting to go study – that’s because we’ve not been made to feel welcome in our workspaces …” Meanwhile, the former England player Rainford-Brent, whose ACE Programme Charity aims to engage young people of African and Caribbean heritage, described O’Farrell’s comments as “just painful”. “Honestly these outdated views in the game are exactly why we are in this position,” she added. “Unfortunately the decision makers hold on to these myths. ‘The Black community only likes football, and [the] Asian community is only interested in education’. Seriously, the game deserves better.” O’Farrell later apologised in a statement, saying that he was “devastated” that the lack of clarity and context in his answers had led to the “conclusions some have made”. “I was aiming to make the point that as a game, cricket has failed a generation of young cricketers, in systematically failing to provide them with the same opportunities that other sports and sectors so successfully provide,” he said. “Cricket has to take responsibility for these failings. We at Middlesex are no different. We have an Academy side that contains in excess of 60% British born Asian and black young cricketers, and we must take responsibility for ensuring that the route into the professional game is as accessible and appealing as other sports or opportunities.” Earlier, during the hearing, another senior cricket executive, the Hampshire chairman Rod Bransgrove, was forced to deny allegations that he had played down the racism furore in the sport. Kevin Brennan MP had told him he had heard an allegation that, at a 19 November chairs meeting at The Oval, Bransgrove had said: “The trouble is that they’ve forgotten the value of white men.” Bransgrove was also alleged to have said: “I know what racism is like. I’m a white man over 60.” However, the executive said in response: “Absolute nonsense.” MPs were also told that, in some cases, clubs were “overachieving” on tackling discrimination – prompting more disbelief from Rafiq, who tweeted: “Overachieving? Am I hearing this?” The ECB also faced difficult questions about its response to the resignation of Leicester chair Mehmooda Duke, who had been the only female chair before leaving the county in November 2019. The chair of the committee Julian Knight MP told the ECB that he had spoken to Duke, and intimated that she had resigned because of cricket’s failure to tackle racism. “Do you think that it’s rather disturbing that a time when you talk about extra diversity on the board, the one person who is a chair from an ethnic minority decides to leave as a result of inaction in this area?” Knight said. “That’s a hammer blow to the ambitions of the ECB.” The ECB refused to answer that question and another from Brennan over whether Duke felt “intimidated, coerced, and manoeuvred by the ECB?” – citing confidentiality in both cases. However, when the deputy chairman of the ECB, Barry O’Brien, was asked whether Duke was “unhappy in any way with any of your personal dealings with her in the way that you’ve handled her concerns?” he replied: “Yeah. She may have been.” Meanwhile, the ECB chose Tuesday to confirm that Clare Connor will lead a review into dressing-room culture in professional men’s and women’s cricket as part of a bid to tackle racism and discrimination. Connor, the ECB’s managing director of women’s cricket and a former England captain, will begin her review in February and make recommendations “to address discriminatory attitudes and behaviours”. The ECB has previously published a five-point plan, including “12 tangible actions”, and pledged £25m over five years to combat the issues of race and discrimination.",Sport/Sport,Middlesex chairman condemned for ‘outdated’ views at racism hearing,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/25/middlesex-chairman-condemned-for-outdated-views-at-cricket-racism-hearing

Chkaifi, 43, also known as Wafah, was attacked in the street by Leon McCaskre, 41, before he died after being hit by a blue Renault Clio. The 26-year driver was arrested on Monday on suspicion of murder and later bailed pending further investigation.  Chkaifi, nicknamed Yaz, who had two sons aged 16 and 18, was described by one neighbour as “really kind person” and another as “very beautiful lady”. One neighbour said Chkaifi and McCaskre were estranged lovers, and the pair shared a second-floor flat in which they could hear McCaskre hitting Chkaifi. Speaking to the Guardian, the neighbour said: “He used to beat her up when he was here. These flats were only built about 12 years ago, so they are very well insulated and sound proofed. But I would hear clumps and thumps and hear her screaming and him shouting. I would knock on the door, and there wouldn’t be an answer, but then it would stop because he knew someone had heard. It was at all times of the day and night.” The police were called after some of the fights, the neighbour said. “I don’t know how many times they came,” she said. The neighbour said: “I saw her recently and we had a chat about various things and she seemed to be on the up, and back to her normal happy self. She was a lovely person really, really kind. And always doing things to a home and making it nice and lovely plants and flowers on her balcony. I think she child-minded for a while.” She added: “But he bullied her, she couldn’t speak to anybody. She had friends, but he just controlled her whole life as far as I could see. And she never looked happy, she was much better when he left and we used to chat. Who knew this was going to happen? She was finally getting back to herself again. And now she’s never going to know her grandchildren, it’s a horrible thing.” Speaking of Chkaifi’s sons, she added: “I feel so bad for the boys.” Chkaifi’s family, who are originally from Morocco, lived locally and are reported to be devastated. Speaking to London’s Evening Standard, her aunt, Haida, said: “She had a heart of gold, was beautiful and had friends from all cultures. Her mother is in hospital. She was taken in after she was given the news. We are struggling to cope.” The attack happened outside St Peter primary school just before 9am.

1/26/2022,"Jimmy Kimmel kicked off the week with troubling evidence from the Trump White House in the days after the 2020 election. Over the weekend, Politico obtained and published a draft executive order from 16 December 2020 which ordered the defense secretary to seize voting machines in battleground states.  The author of the draft order remains unknown, though “Trump himself has been ruled out because there’s no dipping sauce on any of the pages,” Kimmel quipped. The militarization of the election “was a last-ditch effort to keep Trump in power”, he noted. “A Sieg Hail Mary, if you will.” The draft order was part of a cache of documents given to the House’s committee investigating 6 January, after the supreme court ruled that Trump could not shield himself from oversight on grounds of executive privilege. In other 6 January fallout news, Trump has expressed fury that the House committee intends to interview his daughter Ivanka. As he said in a statement: “They’re using these things to try and get people’s minds off how incompetently our country is being run. And they don’t care. They’ll go after children.” “He knows Ivanka is 40, right?” Kimmel laughed. “I mean, I know he missed a lot of birthdays, but … you can’t call them children and also put them in charge of peace in the Middle East. It’s one or the other.” On Late Night, Stephen Colbert checked in on Russia’s movement to amass troops on the Ukrainian border, which has prompted Joe Biden to consider deploying thousands of troops to eastern Europe and the Baltics. “That headline reads way too much like a game of Risk,” said Colbert. “Let’s have some headlines that sound like we’re playing a nicer board game, like ‘Hippo hunger remains insatiable’ or ‘New York City’s biggest landlord: this thimble’.” The US isn’t the only country making moves. Denmark deployed F-16 planes to Lithuania, France has prepared to send troops to Romania, and Spain is sending four fighter jets to Bulgaria. Why all the posturing? On Saturday, the British government accused Moscow of scheming to install a pro-Russia government in Ukraine. “Oh Ukraine, you don’t want that,” said Colbert. “We just got rid of our pro-Russian leader, and he was a disaster.” Colbert then touched on the draft executive order, which Trump tried to keep hidden from the public, outlining plans to seize voting machines after the 2020 election. “In the attempt to overturn the election, the former president wanted the military to seize the voting machines!” Colbert exclaimed. “The only thing standing between us and authoritarian takeover would’ve been elderly poll workers. “Is this getting through to everyone here, that he was going to militarize the election, and seize the votes?” he added. The order would have given the voting machines to the defense department for a 60-day review, keeping Trump in power until at least mid-February 2021. “Man, he will do anything to ruin Black History Month,” Colbert noted. And on Late Night, Seth Meyers decried the draft executive order evincing the Trump administration’s plan to overturn the election. “Sometimes I feel like we’re going to be hearing revelations like this one for the rest of our lives,” Meyers said. “Some day I’ll be sitting in a nursing home, looking out the window at my favorite tree, and a nurse will come in and say ‘did you hear? Trump was training an army of rats to chew the wires out of voting machines.” The draft order cited two classified documents, suggesting the author had access to information about sensitive government secrets. “Wow, so it could’ve been a high-level government executive, or a general, or literally anyone at Mar-a-Lago,” Meyers said. “So whoever wrote this executive order was presumably someone who had access to government secrets, which is pretty crazy,” he continued. “This time, we just happened to get lucky, since Trump is too dumb to get his way and a bunch of people stopped him by threatening to quit. But what happens next time when a Republican politician wants to use the military to stay in power? “I would just like to point out,” he added, “to all the people who thought calling Trump’s plan an ‘attempted coup’ was hysterical, this latest executive order is just more proof that the threat was very real.”",Arts/Culture,"Jimmy Kimmel on Trump’s plan to seize voting machines: ‘A Sieg Hail Mary, if you will’",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/25/jimmy-kimmel-trump-voting-machines-stephen-colbert-seth-meyers
1/26/2022,"Francis Bacon: Man and Beast is a frequently grim but endlessly fascinating parade through the Royal Academy’s main galleries. Room after room – all oxblood and indigo – track the artist’s development from the mid-1930s, with his early, Picasso-ish Crucifixion, to the end, with his last, somewhat unsuccessful and schematic 1991 painting of a bull. It looks like the artist’s heart wasn’t really in it; his use of spray-can shadowing and flicked-on dust doesn’t really help. As well as all the human intrigue, occasional tenderness and persistent cruelty, Man and Beast also looks at Bacon’s interest in animals, and how interchangeable one species becomes with another. A human head with an ape’s shriek or aggressive smile, the dance between bullfighter and bull, a study of two owls on a branch (one of the few genuine surprises in the show, though there isn’t much surprise in that it isn’t very good), Bacon’s monsters and monstrous Bacons confront us at every turn. I want to run away, I can’t stop looking.  With their theatrical painterliness, their flat planes and gnarly eruptions, Bacon’s painted situations and entrapments are nothing if not dramatic. And then there are the screams and the animal cries, the vulnerable and distorted bodies, the flung paint, the arrested high-speed blurs, the slashing grass stems and the rumpled sheets. Sometimes it’s as if all the air has been sucked out of Bacon’s paintings, leaving a dog panting somewhere off an Egyptian highway, with cartoonish cars beetling along the coast road in the background, and the pope on his throne in his cloistered solitude, gasping for air. Is His Holiness all right in there, you ask. Bacon’s figures are invariably in a bit of a state, squirming on the sofa, burying their heads in flowers, naked in the undergrowth, caged in their human zoos. It is what we expect. Should bodies ever be so bendy? I’d have a little scream myself, in rooms done up like that, the light so flat and strong, the colour scheme so ghastly, the spaces between things so empty and so full of threat. Bacon is a manipulative painter, getting us up close then pushing us away. Teasing us with something familiar – a plainly painted doorknob and the key in the lock, a bit of bedframe, a plain acre or two of carpeting, the dangling light-pull, a tweed coat, a stage prop or two of modernist furniture, with the mess of a human or animal form in some sort of paroxysm rearing up in the middle of it all. Bacon is good at this sort of stuff. We are forever being accompanied by silent screams, human and simian dental-work, tongues and lips, bulging calf muscles and cheeks and forearms, the convex and concave meetings of shoulders and neck, prow-like jawlines, twisted physiognomies and ears so well sculpted by his brush, so contoured and thrown into relief you could stick your finger down there and it would go all the way in. Great at ears, and the tender naked soles of the feet, great at asses, toilet plumbing, pleated curtains and furniture, he could never do hands and his Baconised heads became an awful mannerism. Bacon is always arresting, but not always very good. His paintings can flail terribly. The best are when he keeps things straightforward. His 1961 Paralytic Child Walking on All Fours (derived, like many of his images, from a late 19th-century series of photographs by Eadweard Muybridge of humans and animals in motion) is genuinely shocking, in the way the child crosses the room beyond an open window frame that juts in on the right, keeping us at bay. The dog pausing by the drain in the gutter, its owner no more than a shadow of legs, is a wonderful moment of everyday abject silence. But when Bacon paints his late lover George Dyer seated, one leg pooling away on to the floor like a puddle of Silly Putty, the effect is merely absurd. Bacon’s bullfights (all three of them bought together here, for the first time) might be all swerve and torque and slew, an attempt at bravura, but the crowds half-seen through a gap in the sliding wall – like a Nazi rally in a nearby room – feel overcooked. Bacon’s 1944 Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion (not in the show) is a great piece of late surrealism, but the second 1988 version here is suave and silly, as is his 1981 Triptych inspired by the Oresteia of Aeschylus, with their wiggly, unbelievable sci-fi forms. The caption to Bacon’s study of his ex-lover Peter Lacy, curled up and burying his head in the couch, says it might be an image “of pain or remorse”. Or maybe he’s waiting for a good seeing-to, in their fraught S&M affair. Bacon didn’t want stories, but his paintings are full of them, and life, fame and gossip leaked out of Soho and caught up with his obfuscations and the misdirections he gave in interviews. I look forward to the day (it won’t be in my lifetime) when someone who couldn’t possibly have known Bacon or his milieu can look back and evaluate his art without all the trappings, the overheated talk of “man’s inhumanity to man” and all the rest of it. We are still lumbered with all the baggage, all the heavy breathing.

1/26/2022,"Watford are currently plummeting down the swanny at great velocity, so perhaps it’s no surprise that they’ve selected waterway enthusiast Roy Hodgson as their new manager. A master of long-term planning and leaving nothing to chance, Mr Roy famously went on a day cruise down the River Seine during Euro 2016 instead of scouting Iceland, and the in-depth stream-based observations gleaned on that crucial fact-finding mission will undoubtedly stand him in good stead for Watford’s upcoming battle against the current. Land ahoy!  Cap’n Roy has been away from football since bailing out of Crystal Palace at the end of last season. At 74, you could be forgiven for thinking we’d seen the back of the salty sea dog, and that he’d be taking the opportunity to plan another, longer cruise, perhaps with Ray Lewington again, a high-jinks episode of the Love Boat we’d pay top dollar to see. But that’s not Mr Roy’s true calling, and so he’s back, baby, eagerly clutching his compass, $extant, and the nautical and tactical charts that have navigated him from Halmstads to Malmö, to Örebro to Neuchâtel Xamax, to the Swiss national team. Oh he’s got methods up the yin-yang. While fans of the Hornets frantically buckle in for a wild journey of wonder, they’ll spare a thought for the departing Claudio Ranieri, whose reign at Vicarage Road seemed doomed from the start, just like those of Gianfranco Zola, Giuseppe Sannino, Óscar García, Billy McKinlay, Slavisa Jokanovic, Quique Sánchez Flores, Walter Mazzarri, Marco Silva, Javi Gracia, Quique Sánchez Flores again, Nigel Pearson, Vladimir Ivic, Xisco Muñoz and Cap’n Roy.

Recently I’ve had some problems holding down a permanent job, what with Covid and Brexit and some personal issues that need not detain us, so I reckon I’m well qualified for the vacant manager’s position at Watford.

1/26/2022,"The perfect pavlova. A macadamia, aniseed myrtle and bush honey trifle. Bread sculptures baked into the shape of Australian mammals. These are among the delights contestants are tasked with creating on the new season of The Great Australian Bake Off, which returns to screens on Thursday after a three-year absence. Bake Off is a global reality phenomenon that began in the UK and has since been adapted by 35 countries worldwide, travelling everywhere from Kenya to Morocco and Brazil. The format has remained more or less consistent around the world; what makes each version unique is the quirks of the local cuisine. Here in Australia, that means dishes created using native ingredients, classics ripped from the pages of the Australian Women’s Weekly Cake Book and, of course, the quest for the optimised pav.  “I like it crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside,” says Matt Moran, chef and judge on the show. “But somebody else might like it a little bit more brittle.” Moran, together with fellow celebrity chef Maggie Beer, is tasked with assessing the creations dished up the show’s cast of amateur bakers each week. He believes Bake Off is so well loved because “it’s a show everyone can relate to, whether you’re a kid baking your first cookie or a retiree baking bread.” This year, though, there’s another reason viewers might tune in: the Covid effect. The pandemic has transformed many of us from kitchen luddites into keen bakers intimately familiar with the fine art of sourdough starter. For the TV executives behind Bake Off, renewed interest in kitchen creations has been a blessing. “We are absolutely aware of the enthusiasm Australians have for baking at the moment,” says Kylie Washington, general manager and creative director of BBC Studios Productions, who helped bring Australian Bake Off back to Foxtel after a change in production partners, then the pandemic, forced its hiatus. The baking craze also helped when it came time to cast this season. “It meant that we were really spoilt for choice,” Washington says. “We found a wonderfully diverse mix of people.” That included “a lot of males” – something producers have really had to search for in the past. As well as striking a better gender balance, this year’s cast ranges in age from 19 to 62, and includes bakers born in Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, Indonesia and Iran. Washington thinks the quintessentially “Australian flavour” of the cast is part of the show’s charm and what helps Great Australian Bake Off find an audience overseas. (It also airs in the UK, US, New Zealand and parts of Europe.) The show was also relatively lucky when it came to filming, getting in before the Omicron variant hit. Cast and crew had to rapid test every day before they entered the site but managed to avoid any on-set outbreaks. “In comparison to a lot of other shows, we actually breezed through Covid really well,” Washington says. But even if you’ve avoided the kitchen these last two years, Bake Off still scratches the pandemic itch for comfort viewing. Unlike the high stakes competition of cooking shows like MasterChef, Bake Off is friendly by nature. Contestants tackle three different baking challenges each week – first up is the signature, where bakers whip up tried and tested classics, then the technical, where more specialised skills are required. Last is the showstopper, home to incredulous feats of baking that this season will include everything from a hanging biscuit chandelier to a French choux pastry tower in the shape of a nun. One contestant is eliminated each week, but the show is never cruel in the way it goes about reaching its ultimate winner. “It’s soft competition, but it’s very supportive and loving,” says Washington. “The contestants are friends and they’re beautiful people. When they’ve finished their own bake, sometimes they go and help each other out. It’s about helping people achieve their personal best and bring their creations to life.” That means giving the right sort of feedback is something Moran is conscious of. “You can’t sugarcoat things but you’ve got to be constructive,” he says. “If you’re going to give criticism you’ve got to actually tell them why. You’ve got to be able to back it up as to why you didn’t like it and why it didn’t work. Otherwise they just think you’re a dick.” “But it’s not a show where we try to create drama,” he adds. “It’s real.” That’s not to say things never go wrong on Bake Off land – even if you’ve never seen the show, you’re likely familiar with a viral meme of British comedian James Acaster presenting his dish to the judges on the UK celebrity version, telling them that he “started making it, had a breakdown, bon appetit”. “There’s always a couple of things that crash and burn – literally burn, sometimes,” Moran says. “And things fall apart. But that’s the beauty of the show. There’s always drama when it comes to the actual bake itself.” While The Great Australian Bake Off is now in its fifth season, Washington doesn’t believe the core ingredients of the show have changed much over its run. “Bake Off has remained consistent pretty much all the way through. You know the saying – if ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” she says. “People like the fact that it delivers on the same thing every time. It delivers this wonderful spirit and sense of camaraderie and family. There’s no need to change any of that; it’s a beautiful show in the way that it exists.” And as we enter the third year of the pandemic, consistency is a valuable asset. “People just want comfort,” Washington says. “They want to know what they’re turning on to because the world is so unknown and so unpredictable at the moment. So slipping into your jammies, sitting on your couch, tucking into a good old series of Bake Off is exactly the tonic that we need right now.” The Great Australian Bake Off starts tonight at 8.30pm on Foxtel.",Arts/Television & radio,The Great Australian Bake Off returns: ‘it is exactly the tonic we need right now’,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/26/the-great-australian-bake-off-returns-it-is-exactly-the-tonic-we-need-right-now
1/26/2022,"When you’ve got to go, you’ve got to go. But when you’re caught out in public – be it on an outback road trip or in the middle of a city – the pressure intensifies, and finding a public toilet that is clean, stocked and accessible can become painfully difficult.  So, what makes Australia’s best public toilet, and where can we find it? We posed the question and, in the comments and on Twitter, Guardian Australia readers shared their picks. Some it seems are only in it for the architecture; others are looking for pristine cleanliness. Alan444 pointed to an “architectural wonder” in Sydney. In Sydney there is an architectural wonder at Georges Heights, near Frenchys Cafe: louvred timber that is open and airy while angled to maintain privacy in a bushland garden setting. Quite the thing for sitting on the throne. Murgatroyd7’s favourite is in Brisbane. The public toilets in Brisbane City Hall are beautiful, 1920’s black and white art deco. Go check them out people, they’re a hidden gem. Hannibalcrackers likes the old pissoir at Sydney’s Dawes Point: There is a magnificent Victorian pissoir at the north end of George Street in Dawes Point, Sydney. Convenience and comfort as long as you’re a bloke. TheOldBotanist praised the custodians of a public loo in a regional Victorian town. Perhaps not the prettiest, best located or most spectacular, but the consistently cleanest public toilets I’ve ever seen - and I mean spotless, odourless, functional, no rubbish – are in the Victorian Mallee town of Walpeup, associated with the very pleasant Walpeup Wayside Stop Community Park. Bluebec picked the mid-city restrooms outside Melbourne’s GPO on Elizabeth Street – but they’re not the most accessible. The narrow stairs are annoying, but the toilets themselves are spacious, clean, and sufficient enough that I’ve never needed to queue. The added bonus of the sitting area where you can redo your makeup or hair is also a really nice touch (and so old-fashioned).” On Twitter, Pat Armstrong praised the “amazing 80s po-mo [postmodern] toilet blocks” hidden around Sydney’s Darling Harbour, including one under the Pyrmont Bridge. “Every time there’s public works there I fear they’ll be ‘upgraded’ out of existence.” They’re not in fancy places but there are three amazing 80s po-mo toilet blocks hidden around Darling Harbour: one under Pyrmont Bridge, one at the Pier St overpass, and the last one… I forget.Every time there’s public works there I fear they’ll be “upgraded” out of existence pic.twitter.com/u2ylYi3rvi For commenter Choppernoodle, what matters is the upkeep. As a bowel cancer survivor and therefore user of toilet amenities at a moment’s notice, I just send out a big thank you to all of those who work hard to ensure that any toilet amenity is clean. I can’t tell you how much it means to desperately need a loo and find one that, though shabby, is at least clean. Thank you from the bottom of my heart (or the heart of my bottom!). Then of course there’s the quirkier loos, particularly those with an unbeatable view. Alan444 recommends stopping at Devil’s Kitchen campground on the Great Ocean Walk in Victoria. “There was a truly fabulous dunny built up on stilts at the edge of the forest overlooking the amazing Southern Ocean,” he says. Pickaname_Anyname has another in Victoria, at Macalister Springs on Mount Howitt. Single occupant with a Perspex front that looks out over a wilderness valley. The absolute definition of loo with a view. Used to be better before they installed the Perspex and it was just a drop dunny without a door, although you now don’t need to deal with cold swirly winds while your pants are ‘round your ankles.” For a scenic option in Tasmania’s south-west, try the high camp hut at Mount Anne, tweeted Tim Lyons. “[It’s] a long drop toilet with a Perspex back so you can sit (back to the door) and overlook the wilderness including Lake Pedder from most of the way up the Mountain.” This photo does not do it justice, but at the Hut on Mt Anne in SW Tasmania has a long drop toilet with a Perspex back so you can sit (back to the door) and overlook the wilderness including Lake Pedder from most of the way up the Mountain. Picture of hut as well pic.twitter.com/ooOVqyKldS Or you could visit the loo at Old Pelion Hut loo on the Overland Track in Tasmania, suggests Thorn001. “Been there for more than 100 years, no door, long drop, looks straight out [at] the mountains. Gold standard.” For ElstonGunston, you can’t beat the harbour views from a restroom on Sydney’s Cockatoo Island. A few years back I was camping on Cockatoo Island. I went into a mens there and was perplexed by the 4 foot high step up to the urinal … Never seen a urinal set up so high before. Take the step up and you have the best view of the Harbour Bridge from the west. Finally, not forgotten were the toilets that, while often unremarkable, were found just in the nick of time. Ivymantled says a number of toilets have been “thoughtfully installed” along the Larapinta Trail in the Northern Territory. Through 11-12 days of trekking over mountains and through gullies and canyons – even such basic facilities are appreciated. As Realto put it: “The best public toilet is the one that’s easily found when you’re desperate. Bonus if there’s a vacant stall, more points if it’s clean, stocked with paper and handwash soap.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Toilet poll: your favourite Australian public loos, from architectural wonders to a ‘magnificent pissoir’",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/26/toilet-poll-your-favourite-australian-public-loos-from-architectural-wonders-to-a-magnificent-pissoir
1/26/2022,"In the middle of the night, four young Aboriginal men pitched a beach umbrella on the lawns opposite Parliament House and sat down. When dawn broke on 26 January 1972, a police officer came over to ask how long they intended to stay. “Until we get land rights,” one of the four, Billy Craigie, told the officer.  Commissioner Gibson apparently laughed and said, “that might be a long time”. Craigie replied: “Well, we’ll be here a long time then.” It’s 50 years today since the Aboriginal tent embassy was born from that act of defiance. And its demands remain current. Above: Bobbi Sykes (with Gordon Briscoe) addresses a protest at the Aboriginal Tent Embassy, Canberra, July 1972. Below: The Aboriginal Tent Embassy, Parliament House in 1972. Images: Ken Whittington/National Archives Australia The embassy has formed and reformed over the years before becoming a permanent presence in 1992, and has remained a place of Aboriginal resistance in direct line of sight of the halls of power in Canberra. The name “tent embassy” was itself a statement that Aboriginal people were living in substandard conditions, treated “like aliens in their own land”, as Dr Gary Foley says in his 2014 book The Aboriginal Tent Embassy: Sovereignty, Black Power, Land Rights and the State. Paul Coe (on left) addresses Gough Whitlam at the Aboriginal Tent Embassy, Canberra, 1972. To Whitlam’s right, standing, is journalist John Newfong. Image: State Library of New South Wales/Search Foundation “That it has endured for decades as a potent symbol rejecting the hypocrisy, deceit and duplicity by successive Australian governments is a testament to the refusal of large numbers of Aboriginal people to concede defeat in a 200-year struggle for justice,” Foley writes. Billy Craigie’s altercation with the police – the first of many on that site – is recalled by Michael Anderson who, with Tony Coorey and Bertie Williams, made up the original four under the umbrella that morning. Michael Ghillar Anderson. Image: Juno Gemes Anderson says the impact of the embassy was “dynamite”. “In terms of the media, because they really had no idea, this was the first time they ever saw Aboriginal people confront the establishment on anything,” he says. “It made a significant difference. “The embassy was striking a chord that just seemed to be the right time. We had just had Woodstock, the Vietnam war. So it was all about change, and changing ideas and changing conceptions. I think we hit the right chord at the right time. And we brought everything to the attention of the world. I think [it was] very successful from that point of view.” Roxley Foley at the Crossroads Canberra. Image: Juno Gemes The site means many things to many Aboriginal people. Roxley Foley lived there as caretaker for three years from 2016 to 2019 (the “Abbott years”, he says, noting they saw a few prime ministers “in and out of the place” in that time). Foley remembers the embassy as a place of pilgrimage. “For a lot of my time out there it served so many different roles, not only being a place for education and confronting the government. It was very much a place that was holding our mob whenever they came to Canberra and they couldn’t get access to things,” Foley says. ACT police officers remove tents and bedding from the Aboriginal tent embassy on the lawns of Parliament House in Canberra, 20 July 1972. Image: Fairfax Media/Getty Images “It’s a place where people looked for networking into housing, into the health services, just to be listened to. The amount of old people we had travelling to that space as almost a pilgrimage, to heal something in themselves.” The next big milestone comes on 20 July, the anniversary of the day in 1972 when the federal government amended the law to allow police to march in and forcibly dismantle the embassy. Until then, there had been no actual prohibition on camping on the parliamentary lawns and for six months as the embassy grew, it caused the McMahon government intense embarrassment here and overseas. There was a second raid a few days later, by which time the number of embassy supporters had swelled – and continued to rise to more than 2,000 by 31 July. Anderson remembers the attempted eviction as a “bloody battle”. “I’ve been in some brawls in my time … but it was nothing like what happened back then. The record shows that there were about 36 policemen went to hospital and 18 of us went to jail. And so it was a bloody battle. It was one of the roughest I’ve been involved in.” The incident is depicted in the seminal 1972 film, Ningla A-na, which is being screened on site for the 50th anniversary this week. For now though, the Ngambri–Ngunnawal elder Matilda House says it is time to celebrate. “Our sovereignty is still alive and well,” House says. “[The embassy] is the continuation of how Aboriginal people have never forgotten, and the respect and the legacy [we leave] for the generations that are coming through.” Foley agrees. “I think the important thing is not to focus just on the embassy, but 50 years of resistance. And furthermore, 233 years of resistance.”",News/Australia news,‘Fifty years of resistance’: Aboriginal Tent Embassy began with an umbrella and became a symbol of sovereignty,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/26/fifty-years-of-resistance-aboriginal-tent-embassy-began-with-an-umbrella-and-became-a-symbol-of-sovereignty
1/26/2022,"Taking advantage of automaticity (where you set yourself up to do things without having to think about them) is the centrepiece of plenty of positive habit forming advice. For hard-ish asks like exercising first thing in the morning or eating healthy, this might involve something annoying like wearing your gym gear to sleep the night before, or never having chips in the house. But when it comes to saving money, there are now some truly thoughtless solutions (in the best possible way). Automated savings transfers – which whisk part of your wages into a separate account before you can even touch them – are a common weapon of choice for personal finance advisers. These are great for big goals like getting out of debt, building a f-ck off fund, or saving for a major purchase; but there are also smaller ways to save.  One of those techniques used to be a change jar, into which you’d empty all your coins at the end of the day. Then, after months or years, you’d take that full jar to the bank for a pleasantly lucrative payday. Now we’re largely cashless, change jars take much longer to fill up, and finding an ATM or bank that’ll accept a big baggie of coins is harder than it sounds (I speak from experience here). But there is a cashless equivalent: round-up savings. These skim the change off the top of your debit card transactions, rounding up to the nearest dollar and placing the remaining cents elsewhere. Round-up savings started as standalone apps, like Acorns in the US, and Raiz in Australia, which take your savings and invest them for you. But the idea proved popular enough that plenty of Australian banks – including Commbank, ING, Bank Australia and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank’s app-only account Up – now offer a similar functionality in-house (without the subsequent investing). This means setting your savings to round up with each purchase could be as easy as toggling a switch on your existing banking app. If your bank doesn’t offer them yet and you like the idea, you’ll either have to sign up for a separate app or switch banks – which to be fair, is much higher effort. Regardless of the initial setup schlep, the end result is the same: a pleasantly lucrative payday, a few months or years down the line, that you didn’t really have to think about.

1/26/2022,"Among hospitals and health workers there was a sense of galvanising and preparing for Covid-19 as the date for the Western Australia border reopening loomed, according to the president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Omar Khorshid. “It takes something to be really on the horizon for you to understand how urgent it is to actually prepare,” Khorshid, a Perth-based orthopaedic surgeon, said. “One of the good things about the 5 February date was it focused the health system’s collective mind on getting ready. You could finally see some action.”  Now the 5 February border reopening has once again been delayed Khorshid is concerned some of that earlier momentum will be lost and may lead to a false sense of security. But with Covid-19 already spreading in the community, Khorshid said it was only a matter of time before health plans would need to swing into action. On Sunday the state’s health minister, Amber-Jade Sanderson, conceded it would not be possible to eliminate Covid in WA. The premier, Mark McGowan, said the delay in border reopening was to give people more time to get their booster shot. But Khorshid said borders should be opened to help address critical health worker shortages. At the same time, he wanted public health measures like venue density limits and social distancing to be introduced to slow spread and reduce the health system burden. “I don’t want to follow the New South Wales model,” Khorshid said, where premier Dominic Perrottet delayed reinstating restrictions even as Omicron cases surged. But simply closing the border, wearing masks, and testing and tracing would not be enough to address ongoing bed and staff shortages and budget cuts in WA, Khorshid said. He is also worried waiting to reopen borders until winter could see a surge in cases due to immunity from booster shots waning and a more Covid-friendly climate. “If you wait until 90% of people have been boosted to open borders, then you’re talking winter, when there is also flu going around,” he said. “But I suspect the borders will become irrelevant within a few weeks anyway, because with Omicron a small number of cases becomes a high number very quickly. It makes no sense to be hard on borders, but not introduce public health measures. It’s not logical.” The director of the Telethon Kids Institute in Perth and infectious diseases expert, Prof Jonathan Carapetis, feels the hospitals where he works are as well-prepared as they can be for Omicron spread. But he is surprised at the lack of public health advertising campaigns preparing residents of WA – where people have lived more normally than almost anywhere else in the world throughout the pandemic – for Covid-19. He said the lack of information from government was causing fear and a lot of anxiety among parents, who were worried about their children catching and spreading Covid once they return to school. “The most frustrating [thing] is, people want to know what the plan for health is, what the plan for schools is, what the plan is for the economy and for families,” Carapetis said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “They’re not getting that information. There could have been a campaign leading up to February the 5th telling people about how we are getting ready within schools and within health. “As a paediatrician I deal with a lot of incredibly anxious parents and teachers wondering about the real risk to their kids. Why hasn’t there been a coordinated plan to help people understand the true risks of both opening compared to the true risks of not opening schools, and educating people about all the things that are being done to minimise those risks?” He believes WA has had more than enough time to prepare such an education campaign and has also had the benefit of learning from elsewhere. He also shares Khorshid’s concern that people may feel a false sense of security knowing the borders are not reopening anytime soon. “But all the systems have to be focusing on the fact that Covid is here, and we need to be equipped for the long haul,” Carapetis said. “We have some of the worst Aboriginal vaccination rates in the country. There is an urgent need to get to them. I’d be worried if people now say, ‘this has bought us a little bit of time, we can relax’. We now need to make sure we use every day to the max and most importantly, let people know what the plan to reopen is.” Khorshid and Carapetis acknowledge the view among health workers is split, with many feeling the health system is ill-prepared for a spike in hospitalisations. The WA secretary of the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation, Mark Olsen, told the ABC delaying border reopening would save “hundreds of lives” and that there was much relief among the majority of union members. “But if I thought another three months would better prepare the health system, I’d be calling for it,” Khorshid said. Prof Jaya Dantas, the dean of international health with Curtin University’s faculty of health sciences, said it was important for those in WA to recognise that they were seeing Covid spread at a time when effective treatments are now available, where vaccination rates are among the highest in the world, and when more is known about how to curb spread. “Public health is not just about one disease, but it is about the broader public and community good,” she said. “That includes peoples’ wellbeing, their mental health, and their capacity to do their jobs. When there’s this uncertainty, and these moving goalposts, it creates problems. “We need to find a better way of living alongside Covid using all the tools we have now,” Dantas said, “not by just closing borders”.",News/World news,"‘Not logical’: WA needs more than border closures to fight Covid, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/not-logical-wa-needs-more-than-border-closures-to-fight-covid-experts-say
1/26/2022,"Parents in New South Wales have been threatened with court action for keeping their children home from school because of concerns about catching Covid-19. Classes in NSW will resume next week after the release of the state government’s return to school plan on Sunday.  While the government said the plan – which includes the use of rapid antigen tests and a rollout of about 20,000 air purifiers across the state – means students can go back to classes safely, some parents remain sceptical. On Monday, the Guardian reported that a group of concerned parents plan to file legal action against the Department of Education over its refusal to grant them permission to keep their children at home because of fears about contracting the virus. Despite premier Dominic Perrottet insisting on Tuesday that it would be “ridiculous” to fine parents who keep children out of school, the Guardian has confirmed that the education department has denied numerous attempts by parents to seek exemptions for their children throughout the pandemic. In correspondence seen by the Guardian, Sterre Siegenbeek van Heukelom, a mother from the Illawarra region of NSW, was last year denied leave to keep her son home from school on the basis that she, not her child, was classified as being vulnerable to the virus. The correspondence – which is similar in tone to other advice given to parents – stated that advice from NSW Health was that there is “limited risk” in students bringing Covid from school into the home. It stated that exemptions would only be granted in cases where a medical practitioner “explicitly advises” the student should not attend classes. Despite later providing medical advice from her doctor, Siegenbeek van Heukelom’s requests for an exemption have continued to be denied. “In summary, your son is not ill, but lives with someone who is at increased risk,” one letter from the department to Siegenbeek van Heukelom stated. “Learning from home for your son can only be supported if clear and explicit medical advice stating that he should not attend school face to face is received.” Siegenbeek van Heukelom, who has health conditions which placed her in the 1b category during the vaccine rollout, said it was ironic that NSW Health advice about avoiding indoor gatherings did not apply to school settings. “With the transmission and rate of the virus going around in the community it doesn’t feel safe for me as someone who is vulnerable to the virus, and NSW agrees with me that enclosed spaces with many people not being able to socially distance and not being able to wear masks is not ideal,” she said. The government has said that the social, educational and mental health benefits for students attending classes far outweigh the health risks associated with the virus, but the premier has repeatedly said he understands the anxiety facing some parents. Perrottet on Tuesday insisted that parents wouldn’t be punished for keeping children at home during the Omicron wave due to existing health concerns. “When we talk about parents being concerned [and] anxious, particularly in circumstances where their children may have underlying health conditions, we’re certainly not going to be fining parents,” he said. But parents have been threatened with legal action. In a letter sent by a principal to a mother with a pre-existing health condition who kept her child away from school last year, the threat of court action was raised because of “unsatisfactory attendance”. “I am required to make an application to the home school liaison program … for consideration of further action,” the letter stated. “An attendance officer may be allocated to work with you and the school to develop an attendance improvement program. “If you do not meaningfully engage with the attendance improvement program, or there is no improvement in [your son’s] attendance … the Department of Education and Communities may consider further action such as an application to the children’s court for compulsory schooling orders.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In a statement, the Department of Education did not respond directly to questions about whether parents could be punished for keeping their children at home once term resumes due to a fear of contracting Covid. Instead a spokesperson said regular attendance at school for all students was “essential to learning and wellbeing”, and cases in which parents were concerned about their child’s attendance would be “managed collaboratively in partnership between schools and parents”. “When schools are open, all students should be at school unless they are unwell; or they have a medical certificate which states that they are unable to return to school due to an ongoing medical condition,” a spokesperson said. “These students can be supported to learn from home provided a valid medical certificate is supplied. “There are a range of options available if students are prevented from attending school, including the sick or general leave and exemptions from attendance under Section 25 of the Education Act 1990. We always act reasonably when considering leave explanations and exemption applications and will continue to do so.”",News/Australia news,Parents in NSW threatened with court action for keeping children home from school,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/26/parents-in-nsw-threatened-with-court-action-for-keeping-children-home-from-school
1/26/2022,"Claudia Karvan has been part of some devastating TV moments – one, in particular, traumatised a generation of Australians. But for her new vehicle, the Stan series Bump, Karvan’s plan was to make something optimistic, funny and “full of humanity”. Amid the turmoil of the pandemic, the show’s warmhearted embrace hit the right notes – Bump became Stan’s biggest ever premiere when it debuted in 2021 and returned for another series last month. Karvan both stars in and co-produces Bump. To bring the show to life, she worked alongside screenwriter Kelsey Munro and her longtime collaborator John Edwards. She and Edwards previously worked together on The Secret Life Of Us, Love My Way, Tangle and the Puberty Blues reboot – shows that helped make Karvan Australian screen royalty.  In the much earlier days of her career, she had a small role in a movie called The Nostradamus Kid, which starred actor Noah Taylor. The pair once dated. During that time, Taylor painted an intimate portrait of Karvan that she loved – and then lost. Here, she tells us about that irreplaceable artwork, as well as the story of two other important personal belongings. Some linen sheets. I was driving through a salubrious area of Sydney’s eastern suburbs and saw advertised in a boutique shop window: 60% off bedsheets. Never allergic to a bargain, I pulled over and went in. 60% off! That’s a lot. The sheets were linen and white. I’d heard of Egyptian cotton and thread counts and all that palaver, but I’d never heard of linen sheets. I suspected they might be ultra-good, so I scooped them up and took them to the counter. When the amount appeared on the cashier screen I was stunned and embarrassed, having not checked the price. I tapped my credit card. Bargain they were not – or so I thought. I’ve recently discovered I’m a Highly Sensitive Person (look it up, it’s a character trait not a disorder), and apparently us HSP-types are extra aware of the texture of fabrics on our skin – something I’d not thought unique to myself but hey, we never stop learning. These sheets are insane. Even friends who housesit text me to ask “What is the story with these sheets?!” followed by explosive emojis. So they’re coming with me if my house burns down. And it would be silly of me not to use them to wrap up a few of the artworks I’m so lucky to own – specifically one by my closest friend, Lara Merrett. Twenty years ago when I had a newborn, my close friend, who was in a relationship with a rockstar (and still is), gave me a gift. She called it The Boyfriend. The rockstar was often away touring and my partner was often away working, so this gadget was all about compensating for those absences. At the time, I underestimated its powers. I thought it was gimmicky, but 20 years on I still reach for that “boyfriend”, who now lives in a kitchen drawer. He never disappoints. After straining myself and almost giving myself blisters there’s always that a-ha! moment when I remember the “boyfriend”. I stop banging the jar on the side of the sink and running the lid under hot water, open the second drawer down, rummage around the tongs and egg flippers and there he is: my dependable, white-plastic-handled jar opening tool. Yes! That jar of curry paste is all mine. Regret is a heavy word. Regret is such an unfashionable emotion. But I read a great poem recently by David Whyte, called Regret, and I listened to a podcast interview about it. He makes a pretty convincing argument that if we don’t regret anything and if we don’t relive that regret then we won’t learn. So after ruminating on years of losses and even deciding that I didn’t regret losing a family home built out of mud bricks that we’d made with our own hands (nonattachment is a valuable Buddhist practice), I landed on an object that when I lost, I felt deeply crestfallen. When I was very young and going out with Noah Taylor, he painted a terrific, spontaneous, rudimentary nude of me on a salvaged timber baker’s tray. I really loved it. I even travelled three hours to escort it safely during a family relocation. I strapped it to the side of my ute and kept an eye on it in my side-view mirror as I drove down the highway back to Sydney. One moment it was there, next moment it was splinters on asphalt. I think you can see it adorning a wall in the background of some family snapshots, and I’ve bought or been gifted artworks from him since. He’s bloody talented. My lesson from regret is: always check those transport straps!",Lifestyle/Life and style,Three things with Claudia Karvan: ‘He painted a spontaneous nude of me on a baker’s tray’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/26/three-things-with-claudia-karvan-he-painted-a-spontaneous-nude-of-me-on-a-bakers-tray
1/26/2022,"Some years ago I swore I would never write another Invasion Day article, and I know I’m not alone in that decision. I reckon the argument against “Australia Day” on 26 January is fairly convincing and has been well articulated by any number of Blackfullas. The reality is, it doesn’t particularly matter what we say or do, ‘cause “Australia Day” isn’t about us anyways.  In its current commemoration, it is a day that tells a story of a violent and heartless nation that insists upon our forgetting; forgetting what has and continues to be done to us, and forgetting that we were ever here in the first place. And each year we are forced to engage in this annual mythologising, as though all that is needed is a legitimate counterargument to convince them otherwise. Spoiler alert – it’s not. The date of 26 January really is just another day in the colony, which we as Blackfullas know too well. It is around this time that our emails and DMs are flooded with last-minute requests to feature in a podcast or write an opinion piece, typically just days prior, because it’s not like they didn’t know it was coming, every damn year. Right on cue, a current or former prime minister makes some idiotic patriotic statement about “modern Australia” and its formations, which conveniently erases 60,000 years of the world’s oldest living culture, and the subsequent two centuries of violence that defines so much of their own culture. Bless. A lot of Blackfullas will sign off from socials in January, while those who remain lose another high school friend or family member on Facebook over “all the money wasted on Indigenous affairs” or something or other. But each year on 26 January, Blackfullas, even those who chose not to author that op-ed or appear on that podcast, will still turn up to a rally or protest donning our latest or favourite Black protest tee, marching down the same streets that they did the year before. And each year, we add names to the list of our dead that we speak of, those who died prematurely at the hands of the state. The date, as a commemoration of this supposed “modern nation’s” story, is a fairly accurate one when you think about it. Since 1788, there has been no change in the relationship it has with us, not substantively. Any sense of Black progress that is spoken of by them is only ever in regard to our ability to be in closer proximity to them, always on their terms, and to be discarded whenever they see fit. Yet, for me and a whole lot of other Blackfullas, turning up on 26 January at protests is not an appeal to the settlers. It is a rallying call for our people, and despite the repetitive nature of this annual ritual, I will never tire of those words “still here” or “always was, always will be”. Each year, that cry gets louder and louder as the marches extend longer and longer. Such change does not offer me a sense of hope that the settlers will have a change of heart. Our emancipation is not to be found in their validation. Turning up to that protest, is to be immersed in a sea of Black power and is a most critical reminder of who we are as a people, despite who they are as a nation. Irrespective of how the nation state chooses to commemorate it (if they continue, change or abolish it), 26 January will always be for Blackfullas. It’s a day of asserting who we are as a people; one of survival, of an unceded sovereignty, and a story that speaks so loudly to the strength of our spirit, in life and in death. The irony here is you would think that if the settlers weren’t so attached to having pride in genocide, they would see what it truly means to be proud of your people and your nation.

1/26/2022,"Cast members of the Netflix reality series Byron Baes have posted videos to social media of people dancing to live music at a crowded Byron Bay venue in apparent contravention of New South Wales Covid measures. Two of the show’s other stars have posted videos in the days after receiving positive Covid tests that appear to show them out in public.  Covid case numbers in the northern NSW health district have exploded since December, and staff at hospitals serving the Byron Bay area have reported they are under “extreme strain”. On 10 January, two days after the NSW government reintroduced a ban on singing and dancing in hospitality venues, at least three cast members of the reality TV show about social influencers in the Byron Bay area – scheduled for broadcast later this year – were tagged in Instagram videos filmed at the night spot Casa Luna at a birthday party for one of the show’s stars, Hannah Brauer. Footage posted to social media on the night shows patrons dancing to music provided by a DJ. NSW public health orders introduced on 8 January ruled that hospitality venues must not allow singing and dancing on premises, other than by performers. Two of Brauer’s co-stars, social media influencer Jade Kevin Foster, who has more than 1.2m followers, and former Bachelorette star Nathan Favro, are also seen dancing and are tagged in the videos. Police confirmed they had received at least one report of an alleged breach of public health orders at the venue, but when officers attended the venue the following evening there appeared to be no breaches of Covid restrictions by either staff or patrons, a police spokesperson said. The investigation has been concluded without further action. Brauer posted videos of the event to Instagram the following day, and on 14 January asked her 7,685 followers on Instagram whether she was suffering a four-day hangover, or she had contracted the virus. On Sunday 17 January she posted: “Every day, pulling myself out of bed with Covid.” Brauer did not respond to a request for comment. On 13 January, Byron Baes cast member Elle Watson posted a video of what appeared to be a different dinner party at Casa Luna. Videos posted by Watson to Instagram show her standing among people who are dancing. Watson did not respond to questions about the videos. Casa Luna did not respond to a request for comment on whether the venue had complied with NSW health orders. On Wednesday Casa Luna began advertising an electronic music event scheduled for Saturday, to be held outdoors with another local venue. “One thing for sure rave is on!” the online promotion said. “Get your dancing shoes on, it’s gonna swing!” The cover charge for the event is $30 or $50 but a note at the bottom of the promotion suggests certain social media influencers may gain free entry. The promotion signs off with: “We are a Covid safe event”. After Guardian Australia approached Casa Luna for comment on why they were advertising an event involving dancing under the current ban, the venue announced on social media the event had been postponed due to “dancing restrictions applying to outdoor venues”. As of 12 January, almost one in 10 people living in the Byron local government area had had a positive PCR test in the past three months. Figures from the northern NSW health district show that the northern rivers’ cases almost quadrupled from 306 new cases reported on 31 December to 1,154 on 7 January. The latest figures show 85.9% of people over 16 in the Byron shire are fully vaccinated, compared with the state average of 93.7%. Independent Byron shire councillor Cate Coorey said any instances of people openly flouting rules meant to help curb the spread of the virus would be “morally unconscionable”. Coorey said preventable cases of Covid were ending up in the region’s hospitals, which were already at capacity. “I feel particularly sorry for people with other illnesses who need to be at hospital or need to have surgery but are being sent to the bottom of the list or not getting the treatment they need,” she said. “Why would anyone be promoting an event that could likely worsen an already bad scenario?” Two other Byron Baes cast members posted their Covid-positive status on social media after attending a huge private New Year’s Eve party at a Newrybar property about 16km south of the Byron township. Such gatherings were permitted under NSW regulations at the time. The electronic dance duo Flight Facilities performed at the party and later posted on social media: “What a start to 22. Thank you for joining us to break the 21 hex, write CLAIMED in the comments if you got Covid and/or you broke your hex!” Dozens of people responded with “CLAIMED”. Among the more than 1,000 partygoers were Byron Baes cast members Dave Frim and Elias Chigros. Chigros told Guardian Australia he became infected within three days of the party. “Pretty much everyone who was out on New Year’s got it, there was a group of about 10 of us,” he said. On 2 January Chigros drove over the border to Queensland and posted images of himself partying on the Gold Coast the same night. Chigros said he had returned a negative rapid antigen test result before travelling to the Gold Coast and did not return a positive RAT until he returned to Byron Bay the following day, when he began isolation. It was another “two or three days” before he was able to obtain a PCR test, which confirmed his positive status, he said, a result which at the time required mandatory isolation for at least seven days from the date of the PCR test. But on 9 January, four days after the PCR test, Chigros posted a video on Instagram showing him in his car, heading out for a surf. “One week later finally leaving the house,” he said in the video. “I have to admit I have been doing some afternoon walks to try and keep somewhat fit.” Asked whether the video showed he had not followed NSW Covid isolation rules, Chigros said: “I have hours of archive footage I roll out depending on what I wish to promote on the day – such as training, beach days etc.” He did not confirm when the video was filmed. Asked how long he had isolated for, Chigros said he wasn’t sure whether the isolation began after the RAT or PCR test result. “But I just kind of waited until I was starting to be non-symptomatic and it was more than seven days from the RAT test before I started going out again and going to shop wherever else.” Chigros, who has previously described Covid-19 as “the flu”, told some media outlets last week he had just recovered from the virus and was delighted with the result, having lost several kilos while ill. The former Love Island star called it his “Covid shred” body. Frim confirmed he first tested positive for Covid-19 with a rapid antigen test on 3 January. “I reckon it was definitely one of the New Year’s Eve parties I went to,” he said. Frim said both he and his partner, fellow Byron Baes cast member Saskia Wotton, were unvaccinated, but this did not concern him because “I’m still alive”. Videos posted to Instagram in the days after appear to show Frim isolating and receiving deliveries of food. On 7 January however, Frim posted a video showing himself out in public and maskless, saying he thought he was over the virus. “I’m fucking breaking free and going to wash my sins off down at the beach,” he said in the video. “I feel a bit wobbly but I’m gonna wash this thing out and have a test tomorrow and hopefully I’ll be negative.” Prior to 12 January, NSW Health advice was that a person who tested positive on a RAT “must immediately get a standard PCR test from your nearest testing clinic and self-isolate until you receive a negative result”. NSW Health orders were changed on 12 January to treat positive RAT results as an official diagnosis and require isolation immediately. The video shows Frim in a park near people, including children. Asked about the video, Frim terminated the interview and did not respond to further questions about when the video was filmed and whether he had been out in public while potentially infectious. Frim was also reluctant to discuss an Instagram post he uploaded on 6 January, in which he was holding a vial of ivermectin. In September the Therapeutic Goods Administration banned the prescription of the drug for off-label use after social media misinformation went viral about its unproven ability to fight Covid-19. “Where did I get it, is it legal?” Frim asked in the video. “I 100% fucking don’t know and I don’t care really what’s legal and not. “I don’t know if it’s gonna be the end of us but I feel like I’m dying anyway so may as well give it a go. “But if you do know someone that’s got it, it’s probably not a bad idea to grab some.” The TGA has warned that misinformation about ivermectin on social media could result in people administering dosages at a dangerous level, risking possible serious neurological side effects including seizures and coma. “I don’t want to go down that rabbit hole,” Frim said when asked why he was recommending a veterinary grade drug which the TGA had warned against. Netflix Australia declined to comment on any of the cast members’ posts. Assistant secretary of Byron Central hospital’s Nurses and Midwives Association, Liz McCall, told Guardian Australia last week the hospital was at breaking point. It has just 43 beds, and the more serious Covid cases are transferred to Lismore Base hospital 47km away, which is also under severe pressure according to an association delegate there. McCall said she could not verify claims on social media from 11 January that four doctors and eight nurses employed by Byron hospital were off sick with Covid-19, but said the figures sounded accurate. “Like everywhere else, Byron is running on skeleton staff and now skeleton staff are a luxury. The government keeps saying we’re managing, but we’re not. We’re not managing at all,” McCall said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Rumours are rife in Byron that a number of “community immunity” parties were held late last year, where unvaccinated people attended to intentionally contract Covid in the belief it would naturally boost their immunity. There is no suggestion any cast members of the Byron Baes series were involved in these parties. Dr Joel Hissink, a GP at Bay Centre Medical, said he had no doubt the parties took place. “I’ve had a Covid-positive patient who told me they had been approached by other people who wanted to catch Covid, and my patient was asked to suck on boiled lollies so that they could be passed around at such a party,” he said. “I had another patient who told me she had decided to avoid going to the pub because she knew there were people in her broad friendship group who had tested positive and were going to the pub in order to deliberately spread it. “This is just criminal behaviour.” Nicqui Yazdi, who runs a Byron Bay page on Facebook promoting Covid safety, said she had been told about “at least three” of the parties, including one that took place at a property “about a week before Christmas”. “They partied all night, got into the spa together and gave each other Covid on purpose,” she said. “They all got sick, including a baby.”",News/Australia news,Netflix’s Byron Baes cast appear to flout NSW Covid measures in Instagram videos,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/26/netflixs-byron-baes-cast-appear-to-flout-nsw-covid-measures-in-instagram-videos
1/26/2022,"An aged care provider says it has “no faith” in the commonwealth’s supply of rapid tests after deliveries failed to show for almost three weeks after an outbreak, forcing it to withhold them from essential visitors and scramble unsuccessfully to procure its own. The government has repeatedly said it is prioritising its stocks of rapid tests to aged care facilities experiencing outbreaks.  But the supply at St Basil’s Homes in South Australia, which runs three facilities in the state, is so precarious that the provider wrote to residents and their families last week, outlining its serious concerns about government supply and warning the tests were “like liquid gold”. The letter, seen by the Guardian, told families they would need to find their own tests or be barred entry. It also said the provider would be attempting to buy its own tests, which could then be purchased by visitors at cost price. Asked about the policy, St Basil’s chief executive, Michelle Church, said the lack of supply from government had forced its hand. “We did not and still don’t have confidence in the supply chain and certainly no faith in the commonwealth delivering on their promise made on the 23 December 2021 that they would supply free of charge RAT kits to all aged care providers,” Church told Guardian Australia. She said one of St Basil’s facilities had ordered 1,300 rapid tests from the national stockpile three weeks ago, after it was declared an outbreak site. The order still hasn’t shown up in full. The facility received a partial shipment of 600 tests on Friday. Instead, St Basil’s has had to ration limited supplies across its various facilities and prioritise them for its outbreak site. “We aren’t the only ones in this situation. I have had providers asking to borrow from us and certainly we have provided [masks] and gowns as these providers were critically short and were desperate,” she said. “We haven’t shared rapid antigen tests at this stage because we can’t risk our own supply.” The lack of faith in government supply has forced St Basil’s to attempt to bulk-buy its own rapid tests. So far, that effort has been unsuccessful. Church said other providers were also struggling to buy their own. The government this week said it had distributed more than 60m rapid tests to providers experiencing outbreaks. The industry peak body, Leading Age Services Australia, says the government was yet to fully commence proactive distribution of rapid antigen tests to providers not experiencing an outbreak, despite announcing plans to do so on 23 December. Spokesperson Sean Rooney said there was still “dire need” of RATs among many providers. It has also caused providers to restrict visitation, a measure that further isolates residents. One Adelaide man, whose parents are in a St Basil’s facility, said the lack of rapid tests had forced him to call off visits to his parents, who were extremely isolated due to Covid-19 restrictions. “St Basil’s has been good at getting them vaccinated and that sort of thing, but they’re finding it hard, they feel even more locked in than usual,” he said. “They can’t even leave their pod at the moment, they can’t do that, they can’t get visitors. They’re finding that isolation tough.” The lack of test supply is placing more pressure on the aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, who was revealed on Tuesday to have attended the Ashes Test on the same day he declined to appear at the Covid-19 committee, citing officials’ “urgent and critical” work combating Omicron. A spokesperson for Colbeck said the suggestion he had “put his sporting commitments ahead of the health and wellbeing of senior Australians … [is] completely misguided” because he had performed other Covid-related duties on that day and the Test was a day-nighter. Responding to separate questions about rapid test supply on Monday, a spokesperson for the minister said “delivery of rapid antigen test kits is currently being prioritised to facilities in outbreak or recent exposure”. “More than 78m RATs have been purchased by the government, and these are being prioritised for aged care,” he said. Colbeck said the government was aiming to provide an “updated guide” to allow for more social interaction for residents, given Omicron was “at this stage appearing not to have as significant health impact”.",News/Australia news,Aged care provider says it has ‘no faith’ in federal promise of rapid antigen tests,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/26/aged-care-provider-says-it-has-no-faith-in-federal-promise-of-rapid-antigen-tests
