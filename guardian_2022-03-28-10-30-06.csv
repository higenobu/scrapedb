3/28/2022,"Troy Kotsur has won the Oscar for best supporting actor at the 94th Academy Awards, currently under way at the Dolby theatre in Los Angeles. Kotsur won the prize for his role as fisherman Frank Rossi in Coda, the deaf father of Emilia Jones’ Ruby – the “child of deaf adults” as alluded to in the title – and becomes only the second deaf actor to win an Oscar, after Marlee Matlin’s best actress award for Children of a Lesser God in 1987. Coda is a remake of 2014 French film La Famille Bélier and is written and directed by Sian Heder. Alongside Jones and Kotsur, it also features Matlin as Frank’s wife, Jackie. Kotsur has already won a string of awards for his role in the film, including best supporting actor at the Bafta, Critics Choice and Screen Actors Guild awards.",Arts/Film,Troy Kotsur wins best supporting actor Oscar for Coda,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/28/troy-kotsur-wins-best-supporting-actor-oscar-for-coda
3/28/2022,"With all due respect to the Disney marketing department, the most magical place on the planet was a few miles northeast of Orlando’s theme parks on Sunday night. That’s how Exploria Stadium must have felt to the US and their exuberant fans, at least, as a Christian Pulisic hat-trick helped deliver a 5-1 thrashing that hoisted Gregg Berhalter’s men to the brink of Qatar 2022. A tricky and occasionally torturous qualifying campaign is now all but certain to enjoy a happy ending. Of course, the US know from agonising experience that weird things can happen on the final night of Concacaf qualifying, after an easy win over Panama at the home of Orlando City. But in all probability this will not be a case of history repeating. Unlike in 2017, the US can afford a loss in their final fixture, away to Costa Rica on Wednesday. In fact, they can afford a big loss. Even a five-goal defeat would not be fatal given the gap in goal difference between them and Costa Rica in fourth. The result eliminated fifth-placed Panama from contention, meaning that the US can finish no lower than fourth, the rank that entails an intercontinental playoff in Qatar in June, probably against New Zealand. Only the most pedantic mathematician would give any attention to that scenario. The US are second, ahead of Mexico on goal difference and behind Canada, who qualified earlier on Sunday with a 4-0 victory over Jamaica. “I think on a night where we needed to get a resounding win we did so. We helped our goal difference,” a hoarse-sounding Berhalter said on Fox Sports. CAPTAIN AMERICA WITH THE HAT TRICK 🎩🎩🎩Incredible touch and finish from @cpulisic_10 to make it 5-0 for the @USMNT pic.twitter.com/yxFvcgnsoA The final whistle blew on Costa Rica’s 2-1 road win over El Salvador shortly before kick-off in Florida, adding to the need for Berhalter’s side to grab all three points. After a hesitant start, they blossomed in stunning and emphatic style, with Pulisic – a teenage tyro in 2017, his country’s captain and a Premier League star in 2022 – leading by example with two penalties and an excellent spin and calm finish for his third. A night that underlined the team’s evolution between World Cup cycles, from a squad of declining veterans to one defined by fast-improving youngsters, was also an evening to highlight the personal development of the biggest name in American soccer. Admittedly, there were a couple of careless assists from a US-based Panama veteran to ease any nerves. Midfielder Anibal Godoy shoved his Nashville teammate Walker Zimmerman in the face and the defender tumbled to the ground. After a VAR review the referee, Ivan Barton, awarded a penalty that Pulisic converted in the 17th minute. “It’s huge. We knew we had to come out with a really strong start, get on the front foot, get the first goal and go from there,” said Zimmerman after the game. Propelled by desperation, Panama might have equalised less than five minutes later after an Antonee Robinson giveaway prompted pinball in the US box. The Fulham left-back was more sure-footed in the 23rd minute, picking out the 5ft 6in Paul Arriola with a dipping cross. The FC Dallas winger headed in the second, then Jesus Ferreira settled the contest in the 27th minute with a tap-in after a slick move down the right and a deflected touch from Arriola. It was the first goal from a US centre forward since October. Panama, needing to win to stave off elimination, had ample possession and enough attacking flair to cause problems in the American back line, with Zack Steffen uncertain at times in goal. But shoddy defending was their undoing. Godoy, arms whirling like a wind turbine in a hurricane, was penalised for another foul in the box in first-half injury time. On this occasion it was a soft award; the end product was the same, another Pulisic goal. He celebrated, curiously, with a Worm breakdance move. The Chelsea attacker, in pugnacious form all evening, was in the middle of a melee moments later as tempers flared. The US’s previous game was last Thursday’s goalless draw with Mexico in the thin air of the Azteca, where the Americans have never won a qualifier. Given the risk of fatigue, injury and suspension ahead of Sunday’s more pivotal match, it was a bold decision by Berhalter to pick a strong XI for that game. It also carried some logic since the US beat their regional rivals three times last year and Mexico’s squad is unusually insipid. As it transpired, with the game all but over by the break, tiredness was not a worry. Pulisic started both games – but there can be few better salves for weary legs than a 4-0 half time lead and a hat-trick, secured in the 65th minute of an open and lively second period with a neat turn and tidy finish. Godoy concluded his eventful night with a fine header that made it 5-1 with six minutes left, not that it dampened the noise level in the stands. Costa Rica have won five of their past six games and the Americans’ record in the country is dismal. On this evidence, the defence could use some fine-tuning in the next two days. But this was a night to savour the goals, to admire Pulisic, and to prepare for a party. As they hailed jubilant supporters after the match, some of the American players briefly and prematurely held a banner bearing the word “Qualified”. It was quickly wrapped up and put away. They must have got the message: not quite yet, not quite officially. Surely it won’t be long.",Sport/Football,USA all but seal place at World Cup as Pulisic hat-trick fuels rout of Panama,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/27/usa-panama-world-cup-2022-qualifier-usmnt-soccer
3/28/2022,"Communities across a wide swathe of eastern Australia are bracing for the potential of heavy rain and possible flooding over the next two days, with overnight falls already blamed for the death of a man in Queensland. Queensland police were called shortly before 5am local time on Monday to assist the state’s fire and emergency service water rescue crews at Kingsthorpe near Toowoomba after two people were trapped in a vehicle in flood waters. “A woman was rescued and taken to hospital in a stable condition for treatment, however a man was located deceased in the ute,” police said, adding investigations were ongoing as they prepare a coronial report. “A number of dogs also died.” Rain totals topped 100mm in parts of the eastern Darling Downs and the Sunshine Coast hinterland, said Ben Domensino, senior Weatherzone meteorologist. Heavy rain will spread over parts of southeast QLD and northeast NSW during the next 48 hours. Latest high-res modelling suggests the heaviest rain will fall along the coast and ranges between the Gold Coast in QLD and the Mid North Coast in NSW. pic.twitter.com/jLHBC9fR2l “Today as that low-pressure system develops, just near the south-east Queensland coast, the heaviest rain will start to occur just to the south of that low,” he said. The Bureau of Meteorology issued severe weather warnings for large areas of the coastal regions of Queensland and New South Wales. Six-hour rainfall totals could reach 200mm on Monday, it said.Helen Reid, a bureau meteorologist, said it remained unclear whether the trough moving across Queensland and into NSW would develop into an east coast low and remain near the coast or more further off into the Tasman Sea. Severe weather warnings have been issued again for heavy rain extending from Queensland into NSW. Six-hour rainfall totals could reach 180mm in coastal areas. @BOM_au https://t.co/hniuQPsvQ5 pic.twitter.com/owD2coxTGY “It’s possible that the low would be further offshore and not as problematic as a proper east coast low,” Reid said.East coast lows typically pack strong winds along with heavy rain, and that’s not what residents and emergency authorities want. NSW is still getting over two such lows in a week, earlier this month.Still, “everything is wet”, Reid said. “We’ve already have such a wet environment … even 20mm is going to cause flooding in some places because there’s nowhere for the water to go.” Monday was likely to be wetter in Queensland than south of the border, but the system was forecast to move gradually south, potentially bringing the heaviest falls overnight to parts of the northern rivers of NSW, such as Lismore and Ballina, that are still to recover from floods at the start of March. The NSW State Emergency Service said it was preparing “for significant impacts across the north coast from the Hunter to the Tweed”. It had set up two incident control centres at Metford and Grafton, according to an SES briefing. The SES will have a flood rescue cell at Metford and air bases at Ballina, Coffs Harbour and Cessnock. The Australian Defence Force will be among the support agencies. “Everyone needs to be on their guard the whole time,” Reid said. “It could well be in the early hours of tomorrow that is more problematic for NSW.” Just as Brisbane is likely to miss out on the worst of the rain, so too will Sydney, although the harbour city can expect showers each day until the weekend. Warm waters off the east coast of Australia, including off NSW, are contributing to the heavy rain fall events, meteorologists say. @BOM_NSW @weatherzone pic.twitter.com/B2dQ8W3QNE Reid said waters off eastern Australia were contributed to the series of rainfall events, including the latest one. “Combined with the surface trough, extra heat coming up from the oceans just enhances the lift of the moisture in the system,” she said. “It just all adds up to a recipe for a lot more rain and floods.” Domensino said waters off the southern half of the NSW coast had the larger temperature difference compared with long-run averages. Still, those off the northern half of the state were between 0.5-1C above normal. “Certainly this is the time of the year where we typically have the warmest sea surface temperatures anyway,” he said, adding that the additional warmth “would be helping to cause evaporation and putting a bit more moisture into the atmosphere to help fuel this event”. However he said the current rainfall would only last a couple of days. “The last system stuck around for more than a week in eastern NSW, but this one should move offshore a bit quicker,” Domensino said.",News/Australia news,Man and dogs die in Queensland floods as deluge returns to eastern Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/28/man-and-dogs-die-in-queensland-floods-as-deluge-returns-to-eastern-australia
3/28/2022,"Lance ‘Buddy’ Franklin has been reunited with the ball he kicked for his historic 1,000 AFL goal on Friday night after the fan who caught it in the stands of the Sydney Cricket Ground was identified and invited to present the prized Sherrin to the Sydney Swans player. At a press conference held with Franklin at the SCG on Monday morning, Swans fan Alex Wheeler said he had always planned to return the valuable piece of memorabilia – reported to have a six-figure value. “I had a few stubbies that night and went to the pub after but got paranoid that someone would get it from my house so went home pretty early,” Wheeler said on Monday. “It was always my intention to get it back to the Swans and Buddy. “It’s going to be no good to me, I don’t have a pool room to put it up in unfortunately. It was good to get in contact with the Swans and get it back to them.” Franklin entered the annals of AFL history when he became just the sixth man to kick 1,000 career AFL/VFL career goals, sparking wild scenes of celebration at the SCG as the crowd invaded the pitch en masse and play was held up for more than half an hour. The Swans launched an appeal to track down Wheeler after video footage emerged on social media of him falling into the row of seats in front of him as he attempted to catch the ball, before emerging from the pandemonium as other fans stormed on to the pitch shouting, “I got the pill!” “When Buddy marked the ball he was about 10 [metres] inside the 50. I did a bit of quick maths and realised I’m probably 10 or 15 from the fence, so I thought [I was a] really, really big chance,” he said. “From that point on there were so many people rushing to the fence, which sort of probably helped me get to the ball – everyone was filming. I almost felt like I was the only guy throwing the paw out to get it. Just unbelievable that I had the chance to have a crack at it, it just landed in the paw and the rest is history.” Wheeler managed to hold on to the ball and enter the field of play himself – where he did a couple of handballs to himself – before exiting the stadium and heading home to stash it in a “secret place” in his room: his cupboard. The Swans made a public appeal for it to be returned to the club, proposing a meeting with whoever had possession of it to make a presentation to Franklin in person. Wheeler said he was aware of its potential value, but that selling it for a fortune was “not the right way to go”. The ball is back with Bud! #Buddy1000 pic.twitter.com/DufmPGQE4C Franklin thanked Wheeler for delivering the ball to him and said “it means the world to me”. “It’s nice of Alex to give the ball back,” Franklin said. “I haven’t had too much time to reflect on it just yet but obviously it was a significant moment. I absolutely loved it. “It was a really special night – to see so many Swans supporters out here, especially with what happened the last couple of years with Covid, to have a packed stadium was very special and then to kick the goal was awesome. “You could feel it, really, kicking those three goals, you feel the crowd coming down early in the fourth, and then I was lucky enough for Horse [coach John Longmire] to put me back on the ground.” Given its historic nature, the ball has an estimated value of $200,000 according to some reports. A normal Sherrin match ball costs just $200. Wheeler posed with Franklin on Monday holding the cherished ball, and was compensated with another ball, a shirt and a pair of footy boots, all signed by Franklin. He was also gifted two five-year club memberships and a thank you letter signed by Longmire. After the goal was kicked, the match was held up for 33 minutes, as Franklin slowly made his way through the throng of people off the field and the crowd eventually returned to the stands. At one point, even getting the game back under way appeared unlikely, with stories later emerging of two Swans players who found themselves outside the ground amid the chaos.

3/28/2022,"Australian Greig Fraser has continued Dune’s early run of wins at the 2022 Academy Awards, collecting the Oscar for best cinematography. Fraser beat fellow Australian cinematographer Ari Wegner, who was tipped to make Oscars history by becoming the first woman to win the category in the Academy Awards’ 94-years, for The Power of the Dog. Prior to Dune, the Los Angeles-based Fraser is best known for the 2016 films Lion and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, and the 2018 political satire Vice. In 2020, he won an Emmy award for the television series The Mandalorian. With nominations in 12 categories, The Power of the Dog started out as the 2022 Academy Awards’ frontrunner, before the craft categories – which kicked off an hour ahead of the main show – were dominated by Dune. The Jane Campion-directed western epic has thrust a number of Australians into the spotlight, including South Australian actor Kodi Smit-McPhee, who is nominated in the best actor in a supporting role category. Australians Robert Mackenzie and Tara Webb have already lost out to Dune in the sound category, as has Peter Sciberras, editor of The Power of the Dog. New Zealand/Australian director Campion is the only woman to have been nominated in the best director category twice, after The Piano in 1994. Campion is also a nominee in the adapted screenplay category this year. Nicole Kidman is nominated for best actress for her portrayal of Lucille Ball in the biopic Being the Ricardos.
