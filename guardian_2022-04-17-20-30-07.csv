4/17/2022,"A second British soldier fighting with the Ukrainian army has been paraded on Russian television after being captured in the besieged city of Mariupol. Shaun Pinner said he had been fighting alongside Ukrainian marines when Vladimir Putin’s forces invaded nearly eight weeks ago. The 48-year-old former British soldier appeared tired and bruised in a short propaganda video aired by Russian media on Saturday night. He says: “Hi, I’m Shaun Pinner, I am a citizen of the UK. I was captured in Mariupol I am part of the 36 Brigade First Battalion Ukrainian Marines. “I was fighting in Mariupol for five to six weeks and now I’m in Donetsk People’s Republic.” It is not known when the video was filmed or what led to Pinner’s capture. He was fighting alongside his friend Aiden Aslin, 28, from Nottinghamshire, who is thought to have surrendered to the Rubedssian military last week after his battalion ran out of ammunition. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has been in contact with Aslin’s family to support them. However, the UK’s ability to provide consular assistance or obtain information about British citizens in Ukraine is extremely limited owing to the war. Pinner, originally from Bedfordshire, is believed to have moved to Ukraine four years ago and lived with his wife in the Donbas region. The former Royal Anglian Regiment soldier said in January that he was based in trenches 10 miles outside Mariupol. He told the Mail on Sunday in January: “I am here defending my family and adopted city. Russia started this war. It’s funded by Russia and driven by Russia, but we will fight them, make no mistake about that.” Pinner also spoke of his fear of capture: “I fear for my life. The Russians will treat us differently if we are captured because we are British. This is always on my mind, that I will be captured.” He said fighting in the trenches was “like hell”, with snipers frighteningly close. He added: “Separatists are now using drones to drop bombs and mortars – along with automatic grenade launchers and [shoulder-fired] RPG rockets. Snipers are always present and there’s small arms fire almost daily. “Ukrainian forces respond if we deem our lives to be threatened whereas separatists seem to shoot whenever they fancy. “Sometimes it’s very scary no matter how used to it you are. Sometimes you hear it [explosions] start further down the contact line, then it ripples through your position. That’s why you get time to dive into cover and sometimes you may get a warning beforehand. Snipers are less than 600 metres away.”",News/World news,Second British soldier captured in Mariupol is paraded on Russian TV ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/17/second-british-soldier-captured-ukraine-mariupol-paraded-shaun-pinner-russian-tv
4/17/2022,"Hang a hard left past the multiplex and you’ll eventually arrive at The Great Movement, a walk on the wild side, a film to get lost in. Trailing a sickly former miner (Julio Cézar Ticona) around the streets of La Paz, Bolivian writer-director Kiro Russo tosses out conventional narrative in favour of a kind of ongoing social-realist fugue. He wafts us around the wrecking yards and the market stalls and uncovers dangerous magic in the city’s hidden corners. While the result won’t be to all tastes, you can’t fault its ambition. Russo’s picture is harsh and compelling, weightless and strange; the filmic equivalent of a bottle of smoke.",Arts/Film,The Great Movement review – compellingly strange Bolivian drama,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/17/the-great-movement-review-compellingly-strange-bolivian-drama
4/17/2022,"Princess Dinubolu of Senegal hit the headlines in 1908 for entering a beauty pageant in Southend-on-Sea. It was controversial for a Black woman to be part of such a competition and she got as far as the second round at the Kursaal amusement park in Essex. But mystery swirls around this maverick historical figure. Who was she, what did she look like, and where did she go? Anne Odeke’s show – a combination of theatre, stand-up and lecture – gives us an imaginary riff on this little known Senegalese princess. Odeke reconceives her not as royalty but as a local Black British woman called Joanna who enters the competition in disguise. Odeke writes and performs in the production, originally planned for the postponed Vault festival and part of the Essex on Stage season showcasing the region and its artists. It is clear she is a natural show-woman herself: she steers through multiple characters with charm, although the various turns bring some confusion, and she is particularly adept at awkward silences and knowing looks when her white characters deliver another piece of bigotry in their views on race. But her charismatic performance is held back by a truncated story that never lifts off the ground and has too many tangential parts. A framing device features a year 10 school-pupil giving an assembly talk during Black History Month. It contains a literal history lesson with facts and messages bolted on: that the first Windrush-era ship to land in Britain was on Essex soil, in Tilbury; that a tribe was brought to Britain in the early 20th century, labelled “pygmies” and displayed on stage in a kind of human zoo; and a reminder that Africa is a continent not a country. British history certainly needs to be revised to recognise the racism of its past alongside the long, rich history of Black British communities. Plays such as Curious (featuring an 18th century runaway slave turned actor) and The Gift (featuring Sarah Bonetta Davies who Odeke briefly mentions) have created meaty dramas on the bare-boned, badly-documented facts around extraordinary Black British historical figures. But this play puts the history lesson first, the drama second, and takes too many detours before reaching the central story on Princess Dinubolu (there is a comical mugging, the story of Bertha Soucaret who was from Guadeloupe and won a beauty contest in Belgium in 1888, the tale of the “pygmy” tribe) This creates confusion and slows down the pace. And just as we get to the heart of Joanna’s subterfuge when the drama begins to come to life, the story is cut short and another mini lecture bolted on for its ending. It is a great shame because the satire and intrigue in Odeke’s play is most sparky when she is in character as the Princess. She appears as clever and resourceful as one of Sarah Waters’ protagonists, having to think on her feet against hostile forces at the pageant. Still, it remains a pleasure to watch Odeke, who has abundant comic talent – and her show gets an extra star for it.",Arts/Stage,Princess Essex review – Anne Odeke gives spark to Black British history lesson,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/17/princess-essex-review-anne-odeke-black-british-history-lesson-bush-theatre-london
4/17/2022,"The number of employers implementing new diversity and inclusion drives has almost trebled since the end of the Black Lives Matter protests, new research shows. A total of 27% of ethnic minority workers said their employers had introduced new initiatives during the last 12 months in response to the global movement, according to an Opinium survey of 2,000 adults. This was an increase from 10% in 2020, the year in which protests began after George Floyd was murdered by a police officer in the US state of Minnesota. The latest Multicultural Britain survey, undertaken by the pollsters in partnership with the advocacy organisation Reboot, said that almost half (47%) of ethnic minority workers had seen their employer take some sort of action to tackle racism and diversity problems – up from 40% in 2020. “We were interested in questioning whether promises made by employers after George Floyd were just an example of performative activism or if we were still seeing the action happening today, which is why we specifically asked whether employers have taken action,” said Priya Minhas, the lead researcher of the Multicultural Britain series.In 2020, 73% of ethnic minorities said they had experienced discrimination, but this year, for the first time since the Multicultural Britain series began in 2016, that figure dropped to 64%. Minhas said that it’s difficult to tell whether this is positive change as a result of the global protests or because of people largely working from home and restrictions in socialising due to the pandemic.“While there have been improvements in increased satisfaction in what employers are doing, and more people feeling that businesses and organisations are making an authentic effort to tackle racism, there is still work to be done and clearly there are still issues in the workplaces that need to be addressed,” she said.The survey results show that there have been some positive changes in the workplace – somewhat allaying concerns that businesses and companies were only committing to anti-racism in the height of the summer of 2020.Sereena Abbassi, an inclusion practitioner who has worked with organisations including Sony Music, the NHS and English National Ballet, said there were encouraging signs the protests were a watershed moment. She said: “In some instances, there are businesses and employers who were very performative in their work and the catalyst seemed to be George Floyd’s murder for them to accelerate their work around diversity, inclusion and equity, but there are also others who have decided to take it very slow and are instead doing the work quietly, rather than showing up just for the optics.”Abbassi added that she has seen a continued appetite from companies and organisations to want to work with her and that the protests have inspired people to change. From the clients Abbassi has worked with, she feels training sessions and conversations have been successful in contributing to a more diverse and inclusive workspace. She said: “More businesses are thinking about positive action and organisations have developed initiatives like mentoring schemes to ensure junior staff have contact with senior staff. After the protests we saw a lot of rage from people of colour, but also white allies within organisations.” Asked about the survey results that showed people were having fewer conversations about race this year than the summer of 2020, Abbassi said a possible reason for this is that there is real sense of fatigue when discussing race, especially for ethnic minorities who carry the burden of educating white people in their workplaces. She added that people may be concerned that having conversations about race will lead to them saying the wrong things and it could cost them their job.Lawrence Heming, the assistant director of EY’s UK diversity and equity team, said the survey results show it is important for people to understand how recent events like the pandemic and Black Lives Matter protests have affected things, either positively or negatively, for ethnic minorities. Heming says although the results show that some issues surrounding race are still prevalent and that “we are nowhere where I would say we need to be”, there are findings that suggest things are slowly shifting.He added: “More firms in the corporate sector are introducing initiatives and policies to tackle racism and more people are being more mindful on certain issues – this has had a positive impact, but it is important for places to still be held accountable, today, for the commitments they made in 2020.”",News/World news,"Workplace inclusion drives have almost trebled since BLM protests, survey shows",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/17/workplace-inclusion-drives-have-almost-trebled-since-blm-protests-survey-shows

4/17/2022,"For years, Melissa Daniels has been travelling to the vast wilds of northern Alberta to harvest naturally occurring salts on lands her ancestors once hunted and fished. She blends the salt with wildflowers from the woods and sells it in small batches. But Canada’s national park agency recently ordered her to stop, in a move that has angered her community and highlighted the park’s troubling history. For thousands of years, the Denésuliné people hunted and trapped the sprawling boreal forest straddling Alberta and the Northwest Territories. But in 1922 they were forcefully evicted as Canada began creating what would eventually become the sprawling 4.5m hectare Wood Buffalo national park. Daniels, who runs the wellness company Naidie Nezu (“Good Medicine”, in the Dene language) still returns to those lands and takes roughly four litres of the salt each year. But in a recent letter, Parks Canada told her she would not be allowed to continue. “Being that the salt flats … are within the boundaries of Wood Buffalo national park, this is problematic,” the letter read. “We ask that salt from the park stay in the park and not be sold as an ingredient in the bath blend or other products.” The Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation chief, Allan Adam, said Parks Canada had never atoned for the actions against his people or fully compensated them for the loss of their homeland. Allan said the letter to Daniels was “another reminder that Canada is still in the very early days of reconciliation”. Parks Canada said traditional harvesting of salt for personal use was allowed and was a common practice in the park, but commercial harvesting was not permitted. The agency said it regretted not using dialogue with Indigenous partners on this issue. Wood Buffalo is one of the world’s biggest parks and is a critical habitat for the largest free-roaming buffalo population on earth. Its watershed is the only untouched breeding ground for endangered whooping cranes. It became a world heritage site in 1983 but Unesco has recently expressed concerns that the Canadian government is failing in its stewardship of the park. In addition to environmental degradation within the park and the growing threat of resource extraction projects along its borders, a recently published report documents how the Denésuliné people suffered when they were ordered out of the area. Elders tell stories of burned-down cabins and a loss of access to their hunting grounds. One resident, Charlie Mercredi, told the report’s authors that the creation of the park wasn’t right because “people should come first before the bison”. Mercredi said: “The park doesn’t want to acknowledge that they did wrong to us because compensation-wise they would have to pay lots.” Another, Leslie Wiltzen, spoke about growing up knowing that the land that had been inhabited and hunted by her ancestors for thousands of years was off-limits. “How do you describe that in words?” While national parks across the continent have been heralded as a conservation victory in preserving vast swaths of wilderness and ecologically sensitive areas, some come with a dark history. “People being forced off their land in the name of conservation is also part of colonialism and while fronting the climate crisis will require a switch from ‘dirty’ to ‘clean’ power, it also demands a radical reconfiguration of environmental power dynamics,” Naidie Nezu, Daniels’ company, said in a post on Instagram. “Colonialism is colonialism is colonialism.” Daniels wrote that she was undeterred by the warning and would not stop producing her “illegal” salt. “Each time you choose to support Naidie Nezu and soak in our forbidden bath salts, you’re soaking in a century worth of reparations,” she said.",News/World news,Salt spat highlights Canadian national park’s troubling history,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/17/salt-spat-highlights-canadian-national-parks-troubling-history
4/17/2022,"The Red Ellen of the title was Ellen Wilkinson: trade unionist, campaigner, novelist, journalist, essayist and politician. Her nickname refers not only to her political colour and to the shade of her hair, but also to her fiery personality. MP for Middlesbrough East 1924-31 and for Jarrow from 1935 until her death in 1947, for a time Wilkinson was one of only four women in the House of Commons and Labour’s only female MP. Her achievements are extraordinary by any standards, but, given her working-class background and the limited possibilities for women in her day, they are positively heroic. This new play by the dramatist and poet Caroline Bird explores Wilkinson’s later years through a series of disconnected short scenes. Camilla Clarke’s design and Wils Wilson’s direction facilitate speedy scene transitions, with the seven-strong cast acting also as onstage set- and costume-changers. The overall impression is slick and stylish but superficial. Bird’s text emphasises Wilkinson’s presentational qualities, her energy, verve and drive – all superbly realised in a dynamic performance by Bettrys Jones. The strongest scenes show her at work, in relation to the world of her day: arguing that the men on the Jarrow march should not be denied unemployment benefit (she was one of its main organisers); being confronted by women in the blitz (she had responsibility for organising air-raid shelters); announcing in the House of Commons (as minister of education) that milk in schools will be free. On her death, all Wilkinson’s personal papers were destroyed. Scenes devoted to her private life are, therefore, imaginary. There’s nothing wrong with this in principle, but overlong exchanges with her sister, friend, lovers and colleagues are emotionally manipulative of the audience rather than dramatically effective. Bird’s play (a co-production from Northern Stage, Nottingham Playhouse and Edinburgh’s Royal Lyceum theatre), swithering between agit-prop and melodrama, lacks the courage of Wilkinson’s convictions. Red Ellen is at Nottingham Playhouse until 30 April, then tours to Edinburgh (4-21 May) and York (24-28 May)",Arts/Stage,Red Ellen review – sketchy treatment of a heroic politician,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/17/red-ellen-nottingham-playhouse-review-ellen-wilkinson-mp-caroline-bird
