1/5/2022,"Afew days before Christmas, Joe Manchin appeared on Fox News to publicly retract his support for the Build Back Better Act. Even by the pathologically callous standards of Washington, it felt surreal to watch a politician jeopardize tens of millions of lives in a single 10-minute interview. But the stakes of his decision remain clear: without the act, the United States will fall far short of its climate goals, making a century of ecological collapse, economic devastation and civilizational upheaval not only more likely, but increasingly unavoidable. In the wake of the announcement, despair flickered across the internet. Friends called me in tears. My generation has watched our government fail again and again to enact meaningful federal climate legislation. But this latest betrayal is almost too much to bear. It feels like we are being forced to say goodbye: to our democracy, to our future, to the world we were told we’d inherit.  If Build Back Better fails, Manchin may well be remembered as the man who killed the planet. Given the prospect of having to one day explain to his grandchildren why they can’t go outside in the summer, you think he’d at least attempt to marshal some plausible justifications. But his arguments collapse under the lightest scrutiny. His inflation fears have been thoroughly debunked, including by Larry Summers, the patron saint of inflation anxiety. His climate arguments are fundamentally unserious, anti-science propaganda copied straight from the big coal playbook. The most generous interpretation is that he’s a mulish egotist: a man who sticks to his guns, even when his guns are firing blanks. But the bulk of the evidence points to simple bad faith. Since joining the Senate, Manchin has personally grossed over $4.5m from coal companies he owns. In recent months he has received millions in campaign donations from Republican billionaires and fossil fuel executives who want to see Build Back Better die a slow, painful death. Meanwhile, he has ignored the pleas of West Virginia mothers, tuned out the counsel of his own pope and bulldozed the very coal miners he’s so often wielded as political props. In the light of day, his motives seem as obvious as they are depressing. Regardless of his true endgame, Manchin’s reversal raises a pressing question: what exactly is Biden’s strategy? He’s already forfeited his most obvious piece of leverage, allowing the bipartisan infrastructure bill to move forward without any promise of reciprocation. His “charm offensive” – an exercise in Beltway nostalgia, if not outright political delusion – has run aground on the brutal logic of contemporary petro-politics. When it comes to his signature policy agenda, his administration seems flustered, reactive and naive. And yet, the bill must not be abandoned. Executive action alone probably can’t deliver the lasting emissions reductions that climate science demands. If the first Democratic trifecta since 2009 fails to produce ambitious climate legislation, both party and planet will suffer catastrophic consequences. So Biden needs a new strategy, and fast. There are two basic options. The first is to take off the kid gloves and start playing hardball. If he doesn’t have any leverage, then he needs to get some, especially if Manchin is acting in bad faith. That means channeling Lyndon B Johnson and pairing noble intent with sharp elbows. Threaten targeted federal regulations that would cripple Manchin’s benefactors in big coal. Use the bully pulpit to call them out by name: Michelle Bloodworth, Chris Hamilton, Joe Craft, Jim McGlothlin – all the special interests ready to sacrifice my generation on the altar of their quarterly returns. Have the justice department revisit allegations that Manchin’s daughter, former Mylan chief Heather Bresch, played a personal role in criminally inflating the price of life-saving EpiPens (as if corporate fealty and misanthropic greed were a sort of family tradition). Dare him to defect to the Republican party, where he’ll either kiss the ring of the autocrat he voted twice to impeach or be eaten alive as a Republican in Name Only, or Rino. The second option is to publicly accept Manchin’s private counteroffer, get it to the Senate floor for a vote, and then dare him to renege. The $1.8tn counter-offer – which reportedly included universal pre-K, an expansion of the Affordable Care Act and $500 to 600bn in clean energy incentives – would fall short of what working people need. But it would offer some crucial support, while keeping America’s climate commitments alive. There’s a chance Biden could still circumvent Manchin on extending the child tax credit, which would lift millions of American children out of poverty. No state has benefited from the popular policy more than Utah, and Mitt Romney has indicated a willingness to negotiate. Progressives could blanket his state in ads on child poverty while the administration buttonholes him on specifics. Whichever path the administration chooses, they need to abandon their fixation on “projecting normalcy”. We are not living in normal times, and every American knows it. With each new failure, their genteel posture reads less like a steady hand and more like a form of sleepwalking. It’s time they communicated candidly with the American public and made clear what is actually happening. Manchin’s intransigence is not an unfortunate product of normal democratic deliberation. It is a perverse and dangerous attempt on the part of fossil fuel oligarchs to prevent the demos from protecting itself against climate change. Republicans’ lockstep opposition to clean energy investments supported by almost two thirds of American voters is not the product of legitimate policy disagreement, but of a party actively and transparently opposed to majoritarian democracy. As the Biden presidency enters what could be the final act of a political tragedy, the only way out is to break the fourth wall. Sound the alarm and enlist the public. Expose the actors standing between young people and a livable future; between working families and a dignified living; and between all Americans and their right to representation. If Biden wants to win the war for democracy, then he must summon the courage to name it – loudly and repeatedly. Otherwise, his base will remain as we were after Manchin’s announcement: demobilized, despairing and deeply, justifiably cynical.

1/5/2022,"One year ago, he was frantically barricading the doors to the House gallery to keep out the violent mob. Today, he calls the insurrection a “bold-faced lie” and likens the event to “a normal tourist visit”. The story of Andrew Clyde, who represents part of my – heavily gerrymandered – liberal college town in the House of Representatives, is the story of the Republican party in 2021. It shows a party that had the opportunity to break with the anti-democratic course under Donald Trump, but was too weak in ideology and leadership to do so, thereby presenting a fundamental threat to US democracy in 2022 and beyond.  Clyde is illustrative of another ongoing development, the slow but steady takeover of the Republican party by new, and often relatively young, Trump supporters. In 2015, when his massive gun store on the outskirts of town was still flying the old flag of Georgia, which includes the Confederate flag, he was a lone, open supporter of then-presidential candidate Trump, with several large pro-Trump and anti-“fake news” signs adorning his gun store. Five years later, Clyde was elected to the House of Representatives as part of a wave of Trump-supporting novices, mostly replacing Republicans who had supported President Trump more strategically than ideologically. With his 180-degree turn about the 6 January insurrection, Clyde is back in line with the majority of the Republican base, as a recent UMass poll shows. After initial shock, and broad condemnation, Republicans have embraced the people who stormed the Capitol last year, primarily referring to the event as a “protest” (80%) and to the insurrectionists as “protesters” (62%), while blaming the Democratic party (30%), the Capitol police (23%), and the inevitable antifa (20%) for what happened. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of Republicans (75%) believe the country should “move on” from 6 January, rather than learn from it. And although most don’t care either way, one-third of Republicans say they are more likely to vote for a candidate who refuses to denounce the insurrection. The increased anti-democratic threat of the Republican party can also be seen in the tidal wave of voting restrictions proposed and passed in 2021. The Brennan Center for Justice counted a stunning 440 bills “with provisions that restrict voting access” introduced across all but one of the 50 US states, the highest number since the Center started tracking them 10 years ago. A total of 34 such laws were passed in 19 different states last year, and 88 bills in nine states are being carried over to the 2022 legislative term. Worryingly, Trump-backed Republicans who claim the 2020 election was stolen are running for secretary of state in various places where Trump unsuccessfully challenged the results. At the same time, the situation of the non-Republican far right is a bit less clear. While some experts warn that the militia movement, in particular, has turned toward more violent extremism, the violent fringes of the far right are also confronted by a much more vigilant state. This is particularly true for groups linked to the 6 January attacks, such as the Oath Keepers, which has faced increasing public and state scrutiny after 21 of its members were alleged to have participated in the attacks. Similarly, Proud Boys leaders are facing trial over the event, and some have agreed to cooperate with authorities in their investigations. After decades of the US government ignoring or downplaying the threat of far-right violence, President Biden has made “domestic violent extremism” a key concern of his new administration, regularly singling out white supremacists as “the most lethal terrorist threat in the homeland”. Partly in response to reports that former military personnel were prominently involved in the 6 January attack, the Pentagon has acknowledged “the threat from domestic extremists, particularly those who espouse white supremacist or white nationalist ideologies,” to the military and the country at large. This is not to say that the state is in control of the violent far right. While more than 700 suspected insurrectionists have been arrested, only some 50-plus have been convicted so far, mostly facing fines and probation, after judges rebuffed the DoJ. And media reports found that both the military and law enforcement have struggled to rid themselves of far-right ideas and supporters. But potentially violent far-right individuals and groups are now surveilled much more than they have been since 9/11 – we’re in a moment perhaps more similar to the short period after the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995, still the most deadly domestic terrorist attack in US history. In short, a year after the Capitol attack, US democracy is in a different but still fragile place. Most importantly, the extremists are no longer in the White House, encouraging and protecting the far-right mob. In fact, the state is more aware of and vigilant towards the far-right threat than ever before this century. The threat of far-right direct violence is probably less severe than before – not because the movement is weaker, but because the state is stronger. At the same time, the Republican party has become increasingly united and naked in its extremism, which denies both the anti-democratic character of the 6 January attack and the legitimacy of Biden’s presidency, and is passing an unprecedented number of voter restriction bills in preparation for the 2022 midterms and 2024 presidential elections. As long as the White House mainly focuses on fighting “domestic violent extremism”, and largely ignores or minimizes the much more lethal threat to US democracy posed by non-violent extremists, the US will continue to move closer and closer to an authoritarian future.

1/5/2022,"Mark Wood overcame a “rough night” with a stomach illness to deliver his now customary 90mph-plus speeds and a precious breakthrough at the end of a stop-start opening day to the fourth Ashes Test in Sydney. For the second time in two innings, and in near identical fashion to the third Test in Melbourne, Wood got the better of Marnus Labuschagne when the world’s No1-ranked batter edged behind for 28 to a ball that moved away from back of a length. “I had a bit of a rough night but I managed to keep just enough energy for the day,” Wood revealed after stumps. “I had a bit of a stomach problem but I’m hoping that with a good night’s rest and some food inside me I’ll be right as rain.  “I’m delighted to get Marnus because he’s a top player. I know we’ve had this ‘bowl fuller thing’ but I think we have to hit the wicket hard and make them play as much as we can. Thankfully I made Marnus play, it wasn’t an easy ball to leave, and he managed to edge it.” Despite illness and fatigue, Wood was typically happy to play along with the notion that his battle with Labuschagne could become a similar Ashes rivalry to that of David Warner and Stuart Broad after their earlier duel swung back to the Englishman when claiming the opener’s wicket for the 13th time in Test cricket. “I’d love to have a Broad v Warner thing with him,” he replied. “Anybody would love that when they think they’ve got a chance to get someone out. The ball before, Marnus hit me for four so I just tried to zone in a bit more. I knew the ball before was loose but I got this one spot on. “You want to test yourself against the best players. I’ve been a bit frustrated in that I’ve felt in good rhythm and have been bowling well in this series without getting the wickets I would have liked but to get big players like that out makes you very happy.” Warner, who has previously had the better of Broad during their encounters on Australian soil and contributed to the current 3-0 scoreline with scores of 94 and 95, became the latest home player to express surprise that his old nemesis missed out on the seaming pitches in Brisbane and Melbourne. “I really enjoy giving you guys a good story, which is fantastic and it builds up the game,” said Warner, reflecting on his earlier score of 30. “Me and Broady love it when we’re out there. It’s good fun, good funny banter. I tried to drive the ball too straight, that was my disappointment, but it’s awesome to see Broady back out there. “He’s a world-class bowler. Him and Jimmy Anderson bowling at us is great. Obviously, they would have been disappointed with some of these Test matches, not playing together, but that’s for their selection panel. It’s great to come up against the world’s best from England.”",Sport/Sport,Mark Wood overcomes ‘rough night’ to deliver precious Ashes breakthrough,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/05/mark-wood-ashes-breakthrough-cricket
1/5/2022,"In 1983, Douglas Adams and John Lloyd published the classic satirical dictionary The Meaning of Liff, comprised of words for which there were no words yet. For instance: “Moffat, n., That part of a coat which is designed to be sat on by the person next to you on the bus”, or “Trispen, n., A form of intelligent grass. It grows a single, tough stalk and makes its home on lawns. When it sees the lawnmower coming it lies down and pops up again after it has gone by.” Novelty language books being an evergreen format, we are now offered The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows by John Koenig, the bound form of a long-running website, which is like a much more earnest and emo version of The Meaning of Liff. The presiding mood here is a lugubrious narcissism, signalled by defining various nuances of loneliness, anxiety, bittersweetness and things that are “poignant”. There is “haunting solitude” (“wildred”) or “complicated solitude” (“innity”). There are terms for microanalytical worries about one’s “quintessential self” or “inner self”. The star lexeme here, which the author fondly observes has entered some people’s online vocabulary since he proposed it some years ago, is “sonder”, defined as “the awareness that everyone around you is the main character of their own story”.  More enjoyable are the less gloomy, even jaunty coinages, such as “justing” (“the habit of telling yourself that just one tweak could solve all of your problems”), “proluctance” (“the paradoxical urge to avoid doing something you’ve been looking forward to … stretching out the bliss of anticipation as long as you can”), and “bye-over” (“the sheepish casual vibe between two people who’ve shared an emotional farewell but then unexpectedly have a little extra time together”). It’s at such moments that the book overlaps with The Meaning of Liff in that fertile space of the funny-serious. At times the author expands a definition into a mini-essay on, say, “the heartbreaking simplicity of ordinary things” (“maru mori”), and can risk ending up offering the kind of kitsch uplift that ought to be embroidered on cushions: “Perhaps we should try keeping our eyes open while we pray, and look for the meaning hidden in the things right in front of us.” But then, as a fusion of the genres of mindfulness and wellbeing with the browsable vocabulary book, it might just be a work of commercial genius. The benefit the author claims for his work is that readers might feel less alone by seeing strange feelings they have experienced set out in black and white, and so realise that they are part of the great warp and weft of humanity. Indeed, but fiction has long done this without needing to indulge a mania for neologism. The satisfied reader might still wonder, then, whether we really need new words with which to label such an exquisite Farrow & Ball range of emotional shades, or whether having a sufficiency of them would put a stop to the sentences of Proust, or to literature itself.

1/5/2022,"At least once a week April Wielputz jogs down Main Street in Greenville, California, as she has for years. But now the exercise takes her past piles of charred brick and warped metal that once constituted the 19th-century-era buildings of the historic downtown. Sometimes, depending on her route, she runs by the still-standing but empty high school where her eldest son was supposed to start his senior year this fall. The blackened trees, crumpled buildings and even the cleared lots, are a reminder of the Gold Rush town’s staggering loss.  On a Wednesday evening in August, this rural settlement of about 1,000 people found itself in the path of California’s largest single wildfire. Before it grew to nearly 1m acres and became the first known blaze to crest the Sierra Nevada, the Dixie fire destroyed Greenville in about 30 minutes, wiping away more than a century of history, displacing hundreds of residents and inflaming fears in a region already shaken by years of deadly fires.“I saw what happened in Paradise,” Wielputz said, referring to the town about 80 miles away lost to the 2018 Camp fire, which killed 85 people. “But I never ever thought this would happen.” The Dixie fire, suspected to have been sparked by equipment of the Pacific Gas & Electric utility, burned near the close-knit community of cattle ranchers and loggers for weeks before the flames suddenly grew, surprising firefighters. Unlike Paradise and Berry Creek, where the North Complex fire killed 14 in 2020, no one died in Greenville. But as the climate crisis fuels increasingly destructive and intense blazes in the west, the mountain town is yet another northern California casualty. Four months on, Greenville and those who call it home are fighting to navigate their changed worlds and rebuild their community. Wielputz, who lost her home in the fire, is one of a few hundred people who have been able to return to the area – the majority of Greenville’s 1,100 residents are still displaced. She came back to Greenville as soon as officials allowed residents to return and bought a house, spared by the flames, on a hill overlooking downtown, just next to the home she lost. This town, with its sweeping mountain vistas, community spirit and soundtrack of passing trains, is home, she says, which is why she was eager to return, even with the rubble still piled up around town. “It’s still beautiful to me,” she said, pointing to the trees and the mountains. “Everyone’s like, ‘Oh my God, how are you handling it?’” she said while showing her mother the ruins of downtown. “It’s sad, but I’m gonna get used to it.” For some residents the sight of the destruction is still too painful. “It’s so depressing to drive through here, to see all the trees that are gone,” said Jerry Thrall, a 23-year resident whose home in Greenville survived. Marilyn Crouch, 69, spent most of her life in Greenville; her parents graduated from the local high school, as did she and her husband, high school sweethearts, and later their children. Since the fire destroyed her home, Crouch and her husband have moved into a trailer outside her son’s house in nearby Quincy. She longs to return to the community she treasures, but it’s difficult to see the town in its current state and the other parts of the region badly damaged. Traveling to the valley for an appointment, Crouch and her husband were taken aback by the stumps of dead trees along the highway, part of a massive tree removal project. “That whole piece of highway is just destroyed. I cried all the way home,” she said. “I didn’t want to go home that way. Because I didn’t want to go through Greenville.” Actually navigating within the town can be difficult with all the familiar landmarks burned away. Greenville was so small and close-knit that many residents got around not by street names, but by houses and who lived there. “That’s how you’d tell someone how to get somewhere. You didn’t know the names of the streets, you’d tell them ‘where Dick Hamblin lives, three doors down’,” Crouch recalled. But those houses are mostly gone. Cleanup is under way, though that process is expected to continue through January and much of the rubble still remains. While living in the area always came with challenges, it’s been particularly difficult since the fire. There was a housing shortage before, said Veronica Garcia, a spokesperson for Plumas Strong, a non-profit helping support residents after the fire, and now hundreds of people are still displaced. State and federal officials recently brought 14 trailers to the town to house fire survivors, but they’ll have to wait for longer-term solutions. Supply-chain shortages and inflation have made it difficult for local businesses and homeowners to start to rebuild, and for residents who have found housing to furnish their new homes. For those who have returned, cellphone reception and internet service are spottier than ever, residents say. Getting gas or mail requires a drive to Quincy, but the tree removal project along the highway has made a 30-minute journey into a sometimes two-hour trek. Though schools in Greenville survived, children are traveling to Quincy to attend classes. Sheriff deputies travel from nearby communities since the town’s substation burned down in the fire. “We’re facing the perfect storm of issues up here,” Garcia said. “There is a desperate need to have basic services back in this area.” It will take time but Greenville will come back, Garcia insists. Community members and the Plumas Strong group are working on plans that they hope will restore the town to its former glory, while also making it a safer place to live.“We want to be the model for how to build in a high-risk area successfully,” said Garcia, who was raised in Greenville and returned to help out after the fire. “We’re optimistic that we can rebuild with intent but also get our community members back as quickly as possible.” Doing so is not without challenges. Insurers were reluctant to cover houses and businesses in the area before the fire due to the risk, and the community had long relied on increasingly diminishing jobs in the logging industry. “Greenville wasn’t exactly a thriving community beforehand but it was incredibly, incredibly close knit,” Garcia said. “Life is gonna be different for a while. The intention we have now is to put our heads together and think of creative solutions to all the problems rural small towns face.” Todd Johns, the local sheriff who was born in Greenville, said he tries to be hopeful about the town’s future, but that seeing the limited progress made in nearby towns can be discouraging. “I was pretty optimistic until I saw how Paradise looks and that kind of crushed my hopes and dreams. My in-laws lost their home in the Camp fire so I know what Paradise was and what it is.” Those involved with the recovery efforts say they’re working with communities affected by the Camp fire and other blazes to see what lessons they can take from those disasters. Greenville was a deeply special place, both because of its stunning beauty and community spirit, residents say, and worth not just rebuilding, but building back better. “There’s this quality there and you can’t explain it,” said Sue Weber, the vice-chair of Plumas Strong. Weber, a former religious nun in Mother Teresa’s order, came for a three-month silent retreat and never left. “No matter who you are or what you hold, when the rubber meets the road, the community will gather around. I think that’s rare today.”While the future of the town is not yet clear, the close-knit nature that residents talk about appears intact. A Veterans Day parade attracted about 300 people to the streets of downtown. They lined up on sidewalks near the rubble to watch parade floats go by. A few weeks later hundreds headed to a Christmas lights parade in nearby Taylorsville, which was spared from the flames. In Taylorsville, friends met for drinks, children cheered as passersby threw candy into the crowd and announcers paid tribute to the firefighters and community members who fought the flames, providing a moment of normalcy in an unprecedented year. Wielputz rode in the parade on her family’s float. Afterward, her family planned to put Christmas lights up around their new house and decorate for the holidays. It feels right to be back, she said.",News/World news,Revisiting Greenville: the mountain town destroyed by California’s largest wildfire,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/greenville-california-mountain-town-destroyed-dixie-fire
1/5/2022,"Good morning. Lawyers for Prince Andrew and Virginia Giuffre, who has long accused the royal of sexual abuse, finally faced off in Manhattan federal court yesterday, as he attempted to dismiss her civil lawsuit.  The arguments via videoconference came a day after the unsealing of a 2009 settlement between Giuffre and the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew, who is not mentioned in the settlement, has contended that a clause in the settlement bars Giuffre from suing him. The judge, Lewis Kaplan, questioned lawyers for the prince closely over their claim that the settlement means Giuffre’s lawsuit should be dismissed. Giuffre, who accused Epstein and his ex-girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell of sexual abuse and forcing her into sex with Prince Andrew at age 17 – an accusation he vehemently denies – received $500,000 in her settlement with the late financier. Will the settlement agreement protect Prince Andrew? It’s too early to say but the judge did say, apparently speaking rhetorically: “The only people who could enforce it were Epstein and Giuffre.” When will the judge make a decision? Kaplan promised “a decision pretty soon”. Meanwhile, Prince Andrew is facing criticism for trying to use the clause to protect himself. More than 1,000 Americans in positions of public trust acted as accomplices in Donald Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election result, participating in the violent insurrection at the US Capitol on 6 January or spreading the “big lie” that the vote count had been rigged. The startling figure underlines the extent to which Trump’s attempt to undermine the foundations of presidential legitimacy has metastasized across the US. Individuals who engaged in arguably the most serious attempt to subvert democracy since the civil war are now inveigling themselves into all levels of government, from Congress and state legislatures down to school boards and other local public bodies. The finding that 1,011 individuals in the public realm played a role in election subversion around the 2020 presidential race comes from a new pro-democracy initiative that will launch on Thursday on the anniversary of the Capitol assault. What is the Insurrection Index? It’s an initiative that seeks to identify all those who supported Trump in his attempt to hold on to power despite losing the election, in the hope that they can be held accountable. How will the anniversary of the 6 January attack be marked? Joe Biden will mark the first anniversary of the deadly assault at the US Capitol this Thursday by honoring the bravery of law enforcement and will “speak to the truth of what happened”. The dean of the University of Pennsylvania’s law school has condemned one of his school’s own professors for making racist remarks about Asian people, saying that their recent comments were “xenophobic and white supremacist”. Prof Amy Wax, who specializes in social welfare law and labor and family economics law, appeared as a guest on the economist Glenn Loury’s podcast when she called the influx of “Asian elites” into the US problematic and made other racist statements, including a call for less immigration from Asian countries. In a scathing response, Dean Theodore Ruger acknowledged that while Wax’s comments were protected by freedom of speech and she held tenure at the college, they were “diametrically opposed to the policies and ethos of this institution”. What else did Ruger say about Wax’s comments? He said: “They serve as a persistent and tangible reminder that racism, sexism and xenophobia are not theoretical abstractions but are real and insidious beliefs in this country and in our building.” Will she keep her job? Despite the condemnation, Wax maintains her employment at the university. Ruger said Wax would be teaching only elective classes in future and would no longer teach required courses.

1/5/2022,"In 1972, Catholic missionaries entered the Chaco forest of northern Paraguay and forced Oscar Pisoraja’s family, and their nomadic Ayoreo people, to leave with them. Many perished from thirst on the long march south. Settled near the village of Carmelo Peralta on the Paraguay River, dozens more died from illnesses. Still, the survivors kept up some traditions – hunting for armadillos; weaving satchels from the spiky caraguatá plant. “We felt part of this place,” says Pisoraja, now 51. Today, his community – and other indigenous peoples across the Chaco, a tapestry of swamp, savanna and thorny forest across four countries that is South America’s largest ecosystem after the Amazon – are confronting a dramatic new change.  On 13 December, Paraguay’s president, Mario Abdo Benítez, visited Carmelo Peralta to launch construction work on a $103m (£76m) bridge that will cross the Paraguay River to Brazil. On the Paraguayan side, the bridge joins a $445m highway – already half-finished – carving a strip of asphalt for 340 miles (550km) east to west through the Chaco. Mario Abdo Benítez, Paraguay’s president, and Reinaldo Azambuja Silva, governor of Mato Grosso do Sul state in Brazil, at the site of a new bridge across the Paraguay River, due to be completed in 2024 In 2024, when both are completed, the massive infrastructure project across the Chaco, the Bioceanic Corridor, will connect cattle ranchers and soya-bean farmers in Brazil and Paraguay with their lucrative Asian markets, via northern Argentina and Chile. Space is also being left for a parallel freight railway. “This is a historic day for our country,” said Abdo Benítez, likening the highway to a new Panama Canal. “We’re going to integrate our two peoples,” Reinaldo Azambuja Silva, governor of the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul, told the ceremony in Carmelo Peralta. “This is the realisation of a dream.” But campaigners say the Bioceanic Corridor is a nightmare, accelerating destruction of the Chaco – the fastest-vanishing forest on Earth – and piling deadly pressure on its native inhabitants, including some who shun the outside world. In 2019, an area of forest the size of a football pitch was destroyed in Paraguay’s Chaco every two minutes. Smoke hovers over a field in Luque, Paraguay, last August. Such fires are usually started by ranchers to clear land for pasture.

Paraguay’s Chaco is home to more than a dozen indigenous peoples. But the Ayoreo are particularly exposed to the changes brought by the highway: many live along its path, and already face severe poverty and social marginalisation. Leaders from the 11 Ayoreo communities near Carmelo Peralta say the highway poses many threats: from deadly road accidents and rapid social changes to increased illegal deforestation of traditional hunting and foraging grounds. Yet they felt forced to approve the project, says Juan de la Cruz, an Ayoreo local government official. “Even if we said no, they would still build it,” he says. The new road makes travelling to hospitals easier, its supporters say. Until roadworks began in 2019, the surrounding Alto Paraguay region – an area the size of Austria – had no asphalt road. Buses sometimes get stuck for weeks along muddy tracks, with stranded passengers having to be airlifted to safety. An unfinished stretch of the Bioceanic Corridor between Carmelo Peralta and Loma Plata. The Paraguay government says half of the 340-mile highway will be finished this month But the highway is already killing indigenous people, according to locals. Recent traffic accidents and drownings in roadside drainage pools killed several of their community, including three Ayoreo girls, they say. Local consultations with indigenous communities were rushed, argues Lovera. Dozens of lorries carrying quarried material for the highway are now hurtling through Ayoreo land every day, he says. “They’ve never seen this kind of traffic before. They were duped,” Lovera adds. A host of damaging cultural upheavals are likely to follow. Leaders fear the coming tide of passing truckers and ranchers will spread drug use, prostitution and petty crime. These effects have already been seen elsewhere in the Chaco among other indigenous communities since the building of the 480-mile north-south Trans-Chaco highway in the 1970s, which Paraguay is also widening and resurfacing. “The building of a highway always brings negative things with it,” Pisoraja reflects.

More endangered animals will be flattened by speeding lorries, including slow-moving giant anteaters and the aguará guazú – a wolf-like canine. Wildlife tunnels under the road “mitigate the problem but not entirely, and there aren’t enough of them”, says Luis Recalde, a conservationist. Illegal hunting on Ayoreo territory has also intensified, says Enrique Pebi, president of the Union of Native Ayoreo of Paraguay. He contrasts the mass slaughter of giant armadillos, marsh deer, peccaries and jaguars by outsiders with the Ayoreo’s traditional consumption of some animals for subsistence. “They just use them for target practice,” he laments. Tapir bones in the undergrowth near Fortín Isla Po’i, a former base for Paraguayan troops during their 1932-35 war with Bolivia over possession of the Chaco. Locals say some outsiders shoot at animals for target practice Most concerning, locals say, is evidence that the highway is speeding up deforestation. This makes it even harder for the Ayoreo to hunt, forage for honey, fruit and roots, and gather medicinal plants; practices that are key to their survival and culture. Ayoreo villages near Carmelo Peralta accepted fishing boats and tractors in exchange for allowing a 30-mile road through their territory, says Pebi. “The things they’ve given us will wear out in five or six years,” he says. “I don’t know how many hectares we’ve lost for ever.” Meanwhile, amid a local property rush, Brazilian ranchers have bulldozed a track into Ayoreo land further along the Bioceanic Corridor, and started felling trees, leaders say, showing photos of clearances to the Guardian. The Ayoreo are now too afraid of being shot by foreign “invaders” – armed security guards on expanding nearby ranches – to forage alone, says Pebi. “We want to keep it as it is, our reserve,” he adds. “To go hunting, to get honey, to get homemade remedies. Everything’s there. We always say: it’s our only market.” A digger stands along an unsurfaced section of Paraguay’s Bioceanic Corridor. Until 2019, the remote region – which is the size of Austria – had no asphalt road More than 140,000 sq km (54,000 square miles), a fifth of the entire Chaco, has been felled since 1985. This accelerating deforestation has global consequences. The Chaco holds 14 times more carbon-dense biomass than previously thought, one recent study found. Smoke-blackened palms line the highway – testament to the uncontrolled, man-made blazes to clear land for cattle that have swept the Chaco. Unlike the “fishbone” pattern of deforestation along highways in the Amazon, deforestation in the Chaco clears huge rectangles, Nasa observed. Greater deforestation spurred by the new highway also threatens about 150 Ayoreo, in at least 10 small groups, living in voluntary isolation in the Chaco’s forests, say the leaders of settled Ayoreo communities. Excluding the Amazon, they are the only documented indigenous people in the Americas seeking to avoid contact with modern society. For 60 miles, the highway passes near the Patrimonio Natural y Cultural Ayoreo Totobiegosode (PNCAT), a 5,500 sq km Ayoreo refuge. Reports sometimes circulate that Ayoreo people choosing to live in isolation have been killed by interlopers, but are difficult to officially confirm because Paraguay’s authorities do not monitor their numbers, location or wellbeing, says Lovera. A lake at Fortín Isla Po’i. Severe drought struck the Chaco for several months in 2021. In September, the Paraguay River, which runs east of the Chaco, reached its lowest level since records began in 1904 A 2020 Earthsight report found that Brazilian ranching firms were illegally deforesting chunks of the PNCAT reserve and that leather sourced from the area has been used in luxury cars made by European companies such as BMW. Earthsight also singled out a supplier of the Chortitzer Cooperative – a huge cattle, grains and dairy company owned by the Mennonite community of Loma Plata, where the Bioceanic Corridor’s first stage ends. Florian Reimer, Chortitzer’s manager, told the Guardian that its associate had obtained environmental permits to raze parts of the forest. “We’re totally against illegal deforestation,” he insisted. Loma Plata – and the nearby Mennonite colony of Filadelfia – offer a vision of what the rest of the Chaco may soon look like. An orderly grid of roads encloses thin lines of trees. Indigenous peoples, uprooted by deforestation and forced conversion elsewhere in the Chaco, live marginal existences on the outskirts of town. Clockwise from top left: Enxet and Ayoreo workers at the Santa María estate, which covers about 400 sq km of the Chaco. In 2014, the hacienda was investigated for alleged human rights abuses against the indigenous community; the dairy factory at the Mennonite-owned Chortitzer Cooperative in Loma Plata; a Paraguayan soldier picks his way through trees near Fortín Isla Po’i; animal hides dry on the Santa Elisa ranch, which is on land belonging to the indigenous Enxet community of Sawhotamaxa Enlhet-speaking men, formerly far-ranging nomads, cluster on street corners waiting for a day’s labour. The women often engage in sex work. This carries no stigma in traditional Ayoreo culture, but violent assaults and murders of Ayoreo women by non-indigenous men have increased in recent years. Chortitzer spends about $1.5m every year on health and educational projects benefiting about 3,500 local families, says Friesen. “Our objective is to try to live together.” “When I started here in ’75, all this was forest,” says Augustino Lovero, an Enlhet employee of Chortitzer’s dairy plant. “The image of the Chaco is going to change. The asphalt will bring many people, with their factories.” In Ayoreo settlements near Loma Plata, leaders were also sceptical of the highway’s promised benefits. Basui Picanerei says his village of Ebetogue still lacks reliable drinking water and land titles.

Right, Mateo Sobode Chiqueno shows a plaque awarded to him by Paraguay’s senate in recognition of Nothing but the Sun, a 2020 documentary about his efforts to record Ayoreo history “The Bioceanic road brings a lot of danger for the Ayoreo,” says Mateo Sobode Chiqueno, an Ayoreo historian who has spent 40 years recording his people’s memories on to hundreds of cassette tapes. Lovera urges Paraguay to give indigenous communities land far from the road’s impact zone – or risk “genocide, willing or unwilling”. A Paraguay public works ministry spokesperson says the road project was diverted south to avoid several Ayoreo villages and the proposed bridge at Carmelo Peralta re-routed three kilometres north to avoid Ayoreo land. Near Loma Plata, the Bioceanic Corridor links with the Trans-Chaco highway, and will plunge deeper into the western Chaco in 2022. “The Chaco connects us to the world,” a billboard proclaims. The new highway “connects all the sufferings of many, and the good of a few, the businessmen,” counters De la Cruz, the Ayoreo leader from Carmelo Peralta. “And us, we’ll be left at the roadside watching them pass by.” Palms in the Chaco.
