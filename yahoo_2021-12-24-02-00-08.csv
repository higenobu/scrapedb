12/24/2021,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Mississippi authorities say they have identified the remains of a woman found following a tip from an inmate prior to his execution last month. The woman has been identified as 40-year-old Felicia Cox, who disappeared in 2007, said John Weddle, who is the district attorney for several northern Mississippi counties. Her body was found on land that had once belonged to her family in Pontotoc County, Mississippi. In a post on Facebook Wednesday afternoon, Weddle said authorities were able to identify Felicia Cox by matching her DNA with her daughter, Amber Miskelly. Miskelly was 18 when her mother went missing. He said authorities expect autopsy results within the next two weeks. Felicia Cox's remains were discovered on Dec. 12 following a tip from inmate David Neal Cox, who became the first inmate executed in Mississippi in nine years when he was put to death last month. David Neal Cox was executed on Nov. 17 for killing his estranged wife, Kim Kirk Cox, and sexually assaulting her young daughter as her mother lay dying. Cox pleaded guilty in 2012 to capital murder for the May 2010 shooting death. He also pleaded guilty to multiple other charges, including sexual assault. David Neal Cox had dropped his appeals, filing court papers calling himself “worthy of death” before the state Supreme Court set his execution date. Questions had remained about whether David Neal Cox was responsible for the July 2007 disappearance of Felicia Cox, his brother’s wife. Miskelly recently told WTVA-TV that David Cox was the last person to see her mother alive. Before his Nov. 17 execution, David Neal Cox told his attorneys he killed Felicia Cox in 2007, providing detailed instructions on where investigators could find her remains and waiving his attorney-client privilege after death, Weddle announced during a press conference earlier this month. The information was presented to Weddle’s office two days after Cox’s execution, the district attorney said. David Neal Cox had been a longtime suspect in his sister-in-law’s disappearance, he said. In a post to his official Facebook page following the discovery of the remains, Weddle thanked Felicia Cox's family, the investigators, archaeologists, anthropologists and others who helped spearhead the search. “We are thankful the family can now begin the process of giving Felicia Cox a burial,” he said.",U.S./Associated Press,Remains identified after Mississippi man's pre-execution tip,https://news.yahoo.com/remains-identified-mississippi-mans-pre-152907920.html
12/24/2021,"A merchant mariner captured life at sea on a video tour of a Maersk container ship. The video shows the everyday life of cargo ship crew as they spend holidays and months on end at sea. Second mate Bryan Boyle said workers celebrate the holidays on board through festive meals and community. A merchant mariner gave a tour of a 958-foot cargo ship in 2019 that showed the intricacies of hulking freighters that haul 90% of the world's goods. In the video, second mate Bryan Boyle records the vast array of machinery that keeps the ship moving, as well as the crew's and officers' living quarters on the Maersk ship, which was built in 2006. Though the video was taken in 2019, Boyle told Insider it provides insight into the lives of shipping crew today as hundreds of cargo ships wait to dock in US ports. The merchant mariner said it can be difficult to be away from family for months on end, especially during the holidays, but crew find ways to celebrate even as they work through Thanksgiving and Christmas. ""I recall a few unique experiences such as singing and playing music together on Christmas since one of the Able Bodied Seaman onboard was a skillful harmonica player,"" Boyle told Insider. "" Another time we were anchored in Dubai on New Years' Eve surrounded by many ships. We were counting down to the new year and then many of the ships started to blow their whistles in celebration as fireworks were being launched from shore in front of us."" Entertainment options for the ship's crew of 20 to 25 people are limited on the cargo ships. Boyle said that workers' time off can include a mix of movies and games, as well as gym time. The video shows the officers' lounge, which has a pingpong table and TV, as well as the general crew's lounge, which has a poker table. During Thanksgiving, Boyle said he and other officers gathered to watch a football game in the lounge, using a satellite television. Take a look at a view of the crew's mess hall below. In the ship's voyage, it sets out from Norfolk, Virginia, making several stops in the US before heading toward Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. ""I've had the opportunity to work on some interesting vessels,"" Boyle told Insider. ""I've gotten to go to places that the average person wouldn't even know about. It's one of the most appealing aspects of the job."" Boyle said that there's a thrill to arrive at new destinations, remembering how he spent over a month in Africa on one trip. But the amount of time that crews get to explore new destinations has dwindled over the years, he said, as ships rush to get in and out of ports as fast as possible and early COVID-19 restrictions set limits to crew excursions. The video shows Boyle's living quarters, as well as a movie locker that holds hundreds of titles. The video also highlights the mix of old and new technology that helps keep the supply chain moving, pairing engine control rooms that look like they belong on a spaceship with a massive gyrocompass. The navigation bridge also provides an unrestricted view of the waters ahead and operates as a space where the captain and officers can man the entire operations of the vessel. The ship has a massive gyrocompass that helps guide its course. The first seaworthy gyrocompass was produced in 1908. It operates as a type of nonmagnetic compass that uses a fast-spinning disc and the rotation of the Earth to find geographical direction. The video shows the engine room and the combustion engine that helps power an equally giant propeller. Boyle takes viewers on a tour of the exterior of the ship as well, labeling individual parts of the ship and even touring the ship's lifeboat. The video ends by showing how the ship pulls up to a dock in Germany. Cranes discharge containers from the ship. More cranes gradually reload fresh containers before the Maersk Ohio heads back to Norfolk. Watch Boyle's full video on YouTube. Do you work at sea?

12/24/2021,"A winter storm system could bring a rare white Christmas to parts of the U.S., with some grappling with the possibility of snow piling up to 10 feet high. The incoming storm is expected to hit regions in close proximity to sea level, including Oregon and Washington states, according to the National Weather Service. Meanwhile, heavy snowfall is expected in the central Sierra Nevada Mountains, where snow could pile up as high as 10 feet. Most residents in the Sierra Nevadas are expected to see around five to eight feet of snow, with people urged to avoid travel over the coming days due to potentially hazardous driving conditions. “A series of Pacific storms will bring periods of heavy low elevation rain and heavy mountain snow to the Western U.S. through the Christmas weekend,” the National Weather Service said in a tweet on Wednesday. It also warned that flash flooding and debris flows were possible in the vicinity of recently burned areas. For cities like Portland and Seattle, the development means they could see a rare white Christmas this year. ""More and more weather models suggest enough cold air and moisture will overlap across the region to produce accumulating snow to near or at the valley floor beginning Saturday night and continuing into Monday,"" the National Weather Service in Portland said in a tweet on Wednesday night. The weather service said ""additional rounds of snow are probable next week"" as well. In a separate tweet, the National Weather Service in Seattle said ""widespread heavy snow is NOT expected through Christmas Day."" However, it said some snowfall was possible. If Seattle does see snow, the weather service said it would be most likely to fall on Saturday evening through Sunday night. ""Much of the lowlands could see 3-5"" of snow in the most likely scenario,"" it said. The weather service said that in the span of 127 years, Seattle has recorded ""measurable"" snowfall on Christmas day just seven times, with 1909 seeing the most snow at 1.8 inches. For much of the U.S., a white Christmas appears unlikely this year. As of Thursday, data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration showed that just 26 percent of the country was covered by snow, excluding Alaska. The technical definition of a white Christmas in the U.S. is one inch or more of snow on the ground on Christmas day, according to the National Weather Service.",U.S./NBC News,Winter storm could bring 10 feet of snow and rare white Christmas to parts of U.S.,https://news.yahoo.com/winter-storm-could-bring-10-141052338.html
