12/16/2021,"Leaked Microsoft pay data and government filings give a rare glimpse into how much workers earn. Software engineers across business units took home a median pay package of $185,000. But based on a spreadsheet of 1,200 salaries, women at the IT giant claim pay and promotion inequity. Microsoft grew its employee base by more than 23,000 workers in 2021, seemingly unaffected by the woes of a tightening talent market for tech labor. In total, the enterprise software and cloud giant now employs nearly 190,000 workers worldwide, including about 107,000 in the US. But how much is Microsoft — the most valuable company in the world — paying its employees? Insider compiled data from leaked salary spreadsheets and visa applications to get a rare glimpse at just how much Microsoft employees are earning. The data reveals some of the highest-paying positions at the tech giant — and comes alongside employee reports of pay and promotion inequity. Here's a look at current Microsoft salaries among senior executives, software engineers, and more: Dozens of women in technical roles at Microsoft started an email thread sharing stories about disparities in compensation and promotions at the company, and then compiled a pay spreadsheet to document the inequities. More than 1,200 employees shared salaries in the spreadsheet, revealing how much employees, ranging in experience and department, earn each year. CSS, quality engineer, and solution architect roles earned the least, according to the data. The data also shows promotion breakdowns by gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as how much pay rates range based on location. But some of the issues discussed went beyond salaries, and focused on the treatment of certain employees. ""Being kept out of meetings, having men on projects speaking over you, or deliberately ignoring ideas are quick and effective in their speed and subtlety,"" an employee wrote in the email thread.

12/16/2021,"The mice of the Farallon Islands think they’ve got it made. They’re out there with ocean views in every direction, picnicking on plants, salamanders and insects like there’s no tomorrow. But there might not be a tomorrow for the lowly rodents, because the United States government is gunning for them. The Fish and Wildlife Service has found the mice indirectly guilty of serial murder in the death of seabirds and sentenced them to death by poisoning, with a key review of the extermination plan up this week before the California Coastal Commission. Each year, burrowing mainland owls fly to the Farallones to feast on the teeming mouse population. When the mice population drops, as it does seasonally, the owls then eat the eggs of the ashy storm petrel, a bird some consider a future candidate for the endangered species list. So the mice are essentially co-conspirators in the demise of the storm petrels, and the question is: How do you poison 60,000 or so mice who live on an island 30 miles off San Francisco? You load helicopters with roughly 2,800 pounds of pellets laced with a rodenticide called brodifacoum and air-drop the load onto the island, a lethal last supper for the unsuspecting target audience. Some environmentalists, unsurprisingly, are going out of their minds. “They have picked the worst chemical to use in the worst possible place — the most protected piece of ocean on the planet,” said Richard Charter, noting that the islands are designated as a national marine sanctuary and California Marine Protected Area. Charter, senior fellow at the Ocean Foundation, predicts the anti-coagulant poison — which he notes is so dangerous, it’s banned on land in California — will get into the food chain and wreak havoc. We shouldn’t be surprised, he said, if we see “seagulls staggering around Fisherman’s Wharf and dying there.” But the issue has been around for a decade or so and is more complicated than it might appear at first glance, with bird lovers and conservationists among the supporters of the federal airdrop plan. “Point Blue would like to voice our strong support for this project,” says a plea on the website of Point Blue Conservation Science, which partners with the federal government to manage the islands. The organization contends the nonnative, invasive mice, likely introduced by sailing vessels in the 19th century, are messing with the natural environment and threatening the ashy storm petrel, among other seabirds. As Fish and Wildlife puts it in arguing for the poison plan, “The only way to allow the ecosystem to recover is to ensure 100% eradication of the house mice. The survival of even a single pair of mice jeopardizes the whole project, as the mouse population can recover incredibly quickly.” The federal government hopes to begin its aerial assault next fall, and the staff of the California Coastal Commission — which generally stands strong and tall when it comes to protecting sensitive marine habitat — has offered its conditional support. In a lengthy report based on years of study, the Coastal Commission staff concluded that the poison — applied primarily to higher elevations on the islands — will not significantly harm island or marine life other than the disruptive mice. And a staffer tells me that’s been the case in other parts of the world where the same procedure has been used. That doesn’t mean, however, that coastal commissioners will rubber-stamp the staff recommendation on Thursday, when they’re expected to put the matter to a vote. In 2019, the plan was withdrawn by the feds when it looked as though commissioners might balk at the use of the banned rodenticide. And the critics are prepping to testify this week, fighting as they have for a decade. Alison Hermance, of the San Rafael animal hospital WildCare, doesn’t trust the Fish and Wildlife Service’s “hazing” plan, in which it will use flags, lasers, pyrotechnics and loud booms to scare birds away from the poison pellets. “It’s hard to deter a hungry gull,” Hermance said, noting how bold they are if you try to eat something on the beach. If gulls or other birds get the poison in their systems, Hermance fears, it’s going to travel. She said an alarming percentage of the animals brought to WildCare are found to have environmental poisons in their systems, “and a large number of them die.” “And then,” Hermance said, “there’s the optics of saying to people that it’s OK to use these poisons.” So what does she recommend instead? Remove the owls, Hermance said. Or go all in on a pest-management plan that includes trapping of mice and even the use of rodent contraception — alternatives that have been considered and, for now, dismissed by both Fish and Wildlife and the Coastal Commission staff. As for using contraception as a rodent buster, who you going to call? Dr. Loretta Mayer, a University of Arizona researcher who developed a liquid bait contraceptive and has worked on rodent control for roughly a quarter of a century. “I’ve been going all over the globe,” said Mayer, who told me she helped decrease the rodent population in Indonesia, among other places, where they were feasting away in rice fields. Mayer, who has offered her insights to the Coastal Commission but hasn’t chosen sides on the Farallones project, told me it wouldn’t be easy or effective to use liquid contraceptive bait there. But a solid form, about the size of a Rice Krispie treat as she described it, is in development. After years of battles with rodents and other pests destroying my garden, I’d be first in line to buy rodent birth control. I can also recommend cayenne pepper as a deterrent, but I’m not sure how effective it would be tossing it out of a helicopter, or where the offended mice would go. If you’re curious as to how this plays out, you can tune into the aerial rat patrol hearing Thursday by going to coastal.ca.gov. I also recommend tuning in Wednesday, when the commission takes up a privacy case in Rancho Palos Verdes. Two homeowner associations worried about crime got city approval for a proposal to install security cameras designed to read license plates for the sake of monitoring comings and goings in what’s designated as the Coastal Zone. The Coastal Commission staff, dedicated to defending the right of coastal access for one and all, is pushing back. “The proposed development sends a message that the public cannot be trusted in coastal areas where they do not live,” said the staff report. That drew a rebuke from Rancho Palos Verdes City Manager Ara Michael Mihranian, who spoke up for residents. “As public officials,” Mihranian wrote, “we have the responsibility to protect the public and preserve their quality of life, and that includes feeling safe. The proposed Flock Cameras are intended to protect the public and deter crime — not to prevent the public from accessing the coast.” Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Next thing you know they’ll be dropping nets from helicopters.

12/16/2021,"A judge in Louisiana, Michelle Odinet, has asked for “forgiveness and understanding” after a video surfaced capturing a series of racist remarks as her family gathered to watch security footage of an attempted burglary at their home. A Black man was reportedly arrested in connection with the burglary at the Lafayette City Court judge’s home in Bendel Gardens over the weekend. A video that circulated after the incident appeared to show members of her family joking and using the N-word to recap the burglary while they watched the security footage. Odinet, who has four children, confirmed to local news site The Current that the footage was from her home. It’s unclear who shot it, who exactly is using the language and who sent it to several members of the local media. The site also published the video, which contains disturbing and explicit language amid joking and laughter. At one point, a voice is heard saying, “And mom’s yelling n****r, n****r,” to which a woman’s voice answered: “We have a n****r. It’s a n****r, like a roach.” Louisiana Judge Michelle Odinet responds to video she & her family repeatedly say the word “Nigger”

“I was given a sedative at the time of the video. I have zero recollection of the video & the disturbing language used during it.” https://t.co/jGqa1FR2bUpic.twitter.com/7YEqxy7kyW — philip lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) December 14, 2021 Reached by The Current for comment, Odinet said she had been unable to sleep since the incident, had taken a sedative at the time of the video and didn’t remember what was said. “My children and I were the victim [sic] of an armed burglary at our home. The police were called and the assailant was arrested. The incident shook me to my core and my mental state was fragile,” she said. “I was a wreck and am still unable to sleep. I was given a sedative at the time of the video. I have zero recollection of the video and the disturbing language used during it.” She added: “Anyone who knows me and my husband, knows this is contrary to the way we live our lives. I am deeply sorry and ask for your forgiveness and understanding as my family and I deal with the emotional aftermath of this armed burglary.” Despite Odinet’s claims, Lafayette police said no weapon was found on the man they arrested. The footage sparked condemnation and calls for her resignation from local officials and community members. “I strongly believe Judge Odinet should be held accountable,” Lafayette City Marshall Reggie Thomas said in a lengthy statement published by KATC3. “I’m sure that people of color will find it impossible to trust that they will be treated fairly and equally when they have to stand for judgment before Judge Odinet. This type of language cannot be accepted or tolerated by anyone, especially those who serve as leaders in our city,” he said. State Sen. Gerald Boudreaux said that the comments were reprehensible and that he would pursue an investigation. “I respectfully request and will officially petition that the Judiciary Commission of Louisiana investigate the ethical conduct and actions associated with the recent developments,” he said in a statement.

12/16/2021,"The Native American population in the U.S. grew by a staggering 86.5% between 2010 and 2020, according to the latest U.S. Census – a rate demographers say is impossible to achieve without immigration. Birth rates among Native Americans don’t explain the massive rise in numbers. And there certainly is no evidence of an influx of Native American expatriates returning to the U.S. Instead, individuals who previously identified as white are now claiming to be Native American. This growing movement has been captured by terms like “pretendian” and “wannabe.” Another way to describe this recent adoption of Native American identity is what I call “racial shifting.” These people are fleeing not from political and social persecution, but from whiteness. I spent 14 years researching the topic and interviewing dozens of race-shifters for my book “Becoming Indian.” I learned that while some of these people have strong evidence of Native American ancestry, others do not. Yet nearly all of the 45 people who were interviewed or surveyed for the book believe they have Indigenous ancestry and that it means something powerful about who they are and how they should live their lives. Only a tiny – but troubling – number makes blatantly fraudulent claims to advance their own interests. The search for meaning that characterizes racial shifting is part of an old American story. Since the days of the Boston Tea Party, when nearly 100 American colonists dressed in Native American garb before throwing 95 tons of British tea into the Boston Harbor, white Americans have distinguished themselves from Europeans by selectively adopting Native American imagery and practices. Yet as historian Philip Deloria argued in his 1998 book, “Playing Indian,” something happened in American society in the 1950s and 1960s that allowed white Americans greater freedom to appropriate nonwhite identities. White Americans, often with the encouragement of the counterculture and later New Age movements, began to seek new meanings in Indigenous cultures. Those shifts are apparently reflected in U.S. Census data. The Native American population started increasing at a dramatic rate in the 1960s, growing from 552,000 to 9.7 million in 60 years. Prior to then, the Native American population had been relatively stable. What distinguishes contemporary racial shifting from these earlier forms of appropriation is that most race shifters see themselves not as white people who “play Indian,” but as long-unrecognized American Indians who have been forced by historical circumstances to “play white.” Many argue, for example, that their families avoided anti-Indian policies like removal by blending into white society. This gradual but fundamental shift over the last 60 years suggests a seismic upheaval in the American racial landscape. Racial shifting is a rejection of the centuries-long process of assimilation, when different racial and ethnic groups were pressured to adopt white norms of behavior as a way of fitting into an American society that was defined by them. Racial hierarchies that consistently place whiteness at the top are now being challenged. When speaking to me about their former white lives, racial shifters often described a period of sadness when they searched for meaning and connection. Only when they began to look to their family histories did they realize all that had been lost when their families assimilated into whiteness. As one woman from Missouri put it: “They forced us to be white, act white, live white, and that is a very, very degrading feeling.” The genealogical and historical details might not always be verifiable, but the emotions are real enough. It makes perfect sense that once race shifters link their melancholy to assimilation, they try to ease their sadness by rejecting whiteness and reclaiming an Indigenous status. Part of what accounts for these new sentiments are significant changes in the public’s discussion about race. In the wake of 1960s civil rights activism and debates about multiculturalism, whiteness has taken on increasingly negative connotations. In my interviews with race shifters, for example, they frequently associated their former whiteness with racial and cultural emptiness. As one woman put it: “We had an emptiness inside of us, that we did not know who we were or what we were.” They also associated whiteness with social isolation, unearned privilege and guilt over colonialism and slavery. Today there is growing insecurity about what it means to be white in America. We see this being expressed in public debates about white fragility, affirmative action and colorblind policies. Of course, there’s still much security in being white: White privilege is an ongoing reality of American life, and something most white people and white racial shifters take for granted. This shift from white to Indigenous self-identification is, I believe, fundamentally about a desire to leave behind the negative connotations of whiteness and move toward the material and symbolic values that now attach to Native American identity. If you listen only to racial shifters, this growing trend could be seen as a progressive move that challenges the legacy of a racist system. Yet the citizens of federally recognized tribes offer a different interpretation. Most view anyone who self-identifies as Native American without being an enrolled citizen of a federally recognized tribe as a threat to tribal sovereignty. As Richard Allen, a former policy analyst with the Cherokee Nation, told me, “Not only is that an insult, but it’s also an attack on our sovereignty as Cherokee people, as the Cherokee Nation.” Among American Indians, the term sovereignty is used to assert ongoing rights of political self-determination. Because tribes have the sovereign right to determine their own citizenry, American Indian identity is fundamentally a political status, not a racial one, a fact that is often overlooked in debates about Indigenous identity. Racial shifters also undermine tribal sovereignty when they create alternative tribes for themselves outside the federal acknowledgment process. Most of these groups, such as the Echota Cherokee Tribe or the Southeastern Cherokee Confederacy, have emerged since the late 1970s. The number of these new self-identified tribes is startling. Over the course of my research, I discovered 253 groups scattered across the U.S. that identify as some sort of Cherokee tribe. This is a huge number considering that there are only 573 federally recognized tribes, three of which are Cherokee. Racial shifting is a growing demographic trend that is creating confusion in the public sphere about who is Native American and who isn’t. But its threat is far greater than just social confusion. Native Americans and their governments face thousands of race-shifters seeking to join their ranks. And as more and more people reject whiteness in favor of indigeneity, they do so at the expense of tribal sovereignty. [Like what you’ve read? Want more?
