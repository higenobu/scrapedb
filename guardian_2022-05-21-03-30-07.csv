5/21/2022,"A refugee who fled the Nazis and was quietly taken in by the family of Clement Attlee in the run up to the second world war, has died. Paul Willer, 94, escaped Germany in 1939 with his Jewish mother and brother after being sponsored by the then Labour leader. After their escape, the future prime minister, under whose leadership the NHS was founded, invited 10-year-old Willer to stay at the family home in Stanmore, north-west London, testimony and letters show. Attlee neither publicised nor sought to make political capital from his visitor, whose story was first told by the Guardian in 2018. The Association of Jewish Refugees (AJR) said Willer died on Friday. His daughter thanked the association for securing financial help and said his life had a “happy ending”. Willer was raised with his younger brother by his mother, Franziska, in the Bavarian town of Würzburg. Their father, Johannes, a Christian, left their mother in 1933, began a new relationship and declared himself to be a Nazi sympathiser. Franziska, a doctor, struggled to find work and look after her children. She decided to leave Germany after witnessing the antisemitic violence of Kristallnacht (“night of broken glass”) on 9 November 1938. The family was advised that because the children were seen as “half Aryan”, they might struggle to qualify for the Kindertransport scheme, which helped mainly Jewish children. A faint hope eventually came after her London-based brother Otto contacted the Rev William Hewett, the rector of Stanmore. The clergyman sought the help of the Attlees, who were regular churchgoers, who agreed to take in Willer. At the time, Attlee was 56 and had been the leader of the Labour party for four years. Willer’s mother said in her memoirs that she used letters offering a place of refuge in the UK to persuade border guards to let her cross from Germany into the Netherlands and then on to the UK. In 2018, Willer recalled first entering the family home of Heywood in north London. “They took me inside what was a very large house. They had a maid and a cook too. The next morning, their son Martin [the late Lord Attlee], who was my age, took me upstairs and ran a cold bath, bathed and encouraged me to do the same. I thought, ‘Is this what they do for Easter?’ It turned out that cold baths were what the males in the family did every day,” he said. In contrast to the taciturn image of Attlee the politician, Willer’s lasting impression was of a happy, relaxed presence, he said. “He was a gentle man and a gentleman. He was very good with the children and affectionate. At breakfast, we would gather around the table and he played this game where he held out a coin and asked whose monarch’s head was on it. Whoever gave the correct answer was allowed to keep the coin,” he said. Just before the start of the war, Willer left the Attlee home for Northern Ireland. He eventually became a sales director at a textiles company, married, had three children and settled in Hertfordshire. He spent much of his later life in Gloucestershire. In 2018, Willer and his daughter Jo met with the grandchildren of Clement Attlee – Jo Roundell Greene and Lord Attlee – at the House of Lords. In a statement on Friday, Jo Willer said: “My father was lucky enough to have so much excitement in the last few years of his life. “The AJR was so good to put him forward for the Claims Conference scheme. That support and endorsement that he should have the right to remain in his own home and the financial help offered, gave me the confidence to enlist many wonderful people who he came to rely on and who loved helping him. His story had a happy ending,” she said. Willer loved sports cars and was regularly driving his bright yellow Audi TT until September, his relatives said. He passed away surrounded by his clocks, photographs, roses from the garden and his family.",News/World news,"Paul Willer, refugee from Nazis taken in by Attlee family, dies aged 94",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/paul-willer-refugee-from-nazis-taken-in-by-atlee-family-dies-aged-94
5/21/2022,"Pap Ndiaye, the renowned black French historian and expert on US minority rights, has been appointed education minister for the start of Emmanuel Macron’s second term, as the country faces persistent social inequalities in the school system. “I’m a pure product of republican meritocracy,” Ndiaye said, referencing his mother who taught science at a middle school outside Paris. He said he was also “a symbol of diversity” which gave him a sense of “duty and responsibility” to the young people of France. Ndiaye, an expert on colonialism and the history of race relations on both sides of the Atlantic, was head of France’s Museum of Immigration and is seen as on the left. His appointment to Macron’s mix of rightwing and centre-left government ministers under the new prime minister, Élisabeth Borne, was a surprise. Ndiaye represents a break with the previous education minister, the rightwinger Jean-Michel Blanquer, who while in office founded his own thinktank to oppose what he called the US-imported “doctrine” of “wokism”. France has one of the most unequal school systems in the developed world. A pupil born and schooled in a deprived neighbourhood in France has less chance of escaping their socio-economic background than in most other developed nations, according to the OECD. Ndiaye, born outside Paris to a Senegalese father and French mother, gained national prominence with his 2008 work “The Black Condition, an essay on a French minority.” In an Associated Press interview last year, Ndiaye said France had to conquer racial injustice by confronting its often-violent colonial past, noting that “the French are highly reluctant to look at the dark dimensions of their own history.” Ndiaye, whose sister is the award-winning novelist, Marie NDiaye, told Le Monde in 2017 that structural racism existed in France, whereby institutions such as the police may have certain racist practices. Ndiaye was for many years a professor at the elite Sciences Po university in Paris. “In the field of history, he is someone who has been innovative and able to show a new way of understanding the past,” the historian Pascal Blanchard told AFP. “He’s a teacher who knows what it’s like to be in front of a class of students. In a diverse society, it is important to have someone who is attentive to diversity.” The far right’s Marine Le Pen swiftly attacked Ndiaye’s appointment, saying it symbolised “the deconstruction of our country, its values and future”. Macron is under pressure to deliver on his election promise of renewal and a “new method” for politics in his second-term, with less top-down leadership and more listening to voters’ concerns. He has been criticised by opposition parties for waiting almost a month after his April presidential win against Le Pen to finalise a new government to serve under Élisabeth Borne, France’s first woman prime minister in more than 30 years. The new government appointments mark the start of a bitter battle for next month’s parliamentary elections. Macron’s centrist grouping needs to win a solid parliament majority if he is to have a free-hand for his domestic overhaul of the pensions and benefits system, as well as changes to schools and the health-service. A historic left-wing alliance led by the radical left’s Jean-Luc Mélenchon is aiming to increase its seats. Catherine Colonna, France’s ambassador to London and a former spokesperson to late rightwing president Jacques Chirac, was appointed foreign minister, making her only the second woman to hold the job, after the right’s Michèle Alliot-Marie over a decade ago. Many of the government appointments were a continuation of Macron’s last term, with loyal ministers rewarded. Two key ministers on the right – Bruno Le Maire at the economy ministry and Gérald Darmanin at the interior ministry – both kept their seats. The justice minister Éric Dupond-Moretti also remained. Macron’s promised environmental drive for France to become “the first major nation to abandon gas, oil and coal” will be led by the prime minister with two ministers who had previously served in Macron’s first term: Amélie de Montchalin, and Agnès Pannier-Runacher.",News/World news,France: black historian Pap Ndiaye appointed as education minister,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/france-black-historian-pap-ndiaye-appointed-as-education-minister
5/21/2022,"Leeds United and Burnley have written to the Premier League asking it to investigate whether Everton broke spending rules during the pandemic and reserving the right to take legal action. The three clubs have been locked in a relegation struggle, with Everton securing their escape from the drop with victory over Crystal Palace on Thursday. Before that, their rivals asked for an inquiry that could see the Merseyside club fined or docked points if found guilty. Everton say they have complied with the rules. According to claims first reported by the Times, Leeds and Burnley have asked for clarity over whether Everton’s losses of £371.8m over the past three years break financial fair play rules. The rules allow for maximum losses of £105m over a three-year period and, although they were adjusted to allow clubs to write off losses incurred because of the pandemic, the complainants argue that Everton’s apparent Covid losses are far larger than other clubs’. In their last accounts, Everton said £170m of their losses had been related to the pandemic. Aston Villa put their figure at £56m and Arsenal said £86m had been lost because of Covid. In March Everton’s CEO, Denis Barrett-Baxendale, wrote in the club’s annual accounts: “Losses of at least £170m are attributed to the impact on the club of the Covid-19 pandemic, with £103m of that figure coming in the 2020-21 financial year. “The wide-ranging impact of Covid-19 on Everton — which further market analysis has indicated could include an additional £50m — covers lost revenues, additional costs due to strict Covid-19 playing protocols and a significant contraction in the transfer market which resulted in the inability to generate the level of transfer fees which could reasonably have been expected pre-pandemic.” Leeds and Burnley are reported to want the league to appoint an independent commission to look at Everton’s records and decide on disciplinary measures, should they be deemed appropriate. Neither club would comment publicly on the letter. The Premier League also declined to comment. An Everton spokesperson said: “We have worked so closely with the Premier League to make sure we are compliant, we are comfortable we have complied with the rules. “External auditors have told us what we can and cannot claim against the pandemic. If they want to take legal action then they can do so by all means.”",Sport/Football,Leeds and Burnley ask Premier League to look into Everton over spending rules,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/20/leeds-burnley-ask-premier-league-investigate-everton-over-pandemic-spending-rules
5/21/2022,"Police chiefs will declare they are “ashamed” about racism remaining in law enforcement, and apologise for the “discrimination and bias” still plaguing forces in a new race plan launching next week. The plan from National Police Chiefs Council and College of Policing will avoid admitting institutional racism, which critics brand a failure which could doom the promised reforms. However, it will instead commit to be being “institutionally anti-racist”, and aim to start winning back the confidence of black people, which among black Caribbean people is 20% lower than the national average. They vow to end the treatment which black people find “stigmatising and humiliating”, and police chiefs from England and Wales will say: “We accept that policing still contains racism, discrimination and bias. We are ashamed of those truths, we apologise for them and we are determined to change them.” The plan, running to more than 50 pages, follows months of intense and at times bitter discussions. It was triggered by the mass protests after the murder of George Floyd in the United States by a police officer, and has taken so long it will be published just a day before the second anniversary of his death. The document and planned reforms comes after decades of promises by policing to stamp out racism in the ranks, and failure to deliver. In 1999, policing was declared to be institutionally racist by the Macpherson inquiry into the police blunders that allowed the racist murderers of Stephen Lawrence to escape justice after he was stabbed to death at a London bus stop. Policing has in large parts – especially in the Met –declared that the label no longer applies. The Guardian has revealed chiefs were debating a public declaration, almost a quarter of a century on from Macpherson, that policing remained so. Some chief constables and community experts they consulted insisted that accepting the label was the essential starting point to repair the damage, otherwise any plan risked never even getting a hearing from communities weary of promises and false claims they had been delivered. Police leaders could not agree to accept forces were still institutionally racist, even holding a vote The chiefs will say: “Much has been done in the intervening years by policing to address racism in the police and society. “Despite this, change has not been fast nor significant enough in Black communities. As we have prepared this plan, we have heard the views of Black people and their experiences of policing. We have listened to the voices of our own Black colleagues about the service they belong to. “The challenge for reform, set out by Macpherson, cannot be said to have been unambiguously answered by policing. Many people believe policing to still be institutionally racist and have grounds for this view.” The murder of George Floyd in the US saw over 250,000 people take to British streets in support of Black Live Matter and calls for racial justice in a phalanx of protests, despite the country being in lockdown. Discussions within policing with ethnic minority officers saw some chiefs realise the race problems in their forces were more severe than they had realised. The document says: “We have much to do to secure the confidence of Black people, including our own staff, and improve their experience of policing – and we will. We will be held to account and we welcome scrutiny. “That need for change is evident. Policing lags behind almost every part of the public service as an employer of choice for Black people. Confidence levels are much lower, and our powers are disproportionately applied to Black people. In some crimes, victimisation rates are higher. “Black officers and staff leave policing earlier in their careers than White staff and the fact we have only seen two Black officers reach chief constable or assistant commissioner rank in policing’s history is a failure. “ One chief constable who supports accepting policing is institutionally racist said: “All the figures show it still is.” One chief who opposed it said the label was “unhelpful” and not accurate. Victor Olisa, former head of diversity at Scotland Yard, said failing to admit institutional racism will blow the credibility of the new promises: “They may say they will do better, but without an admission of institutional racism, it won’t be believed in communities. “Police chiefs are being insular and doing what suits them and not the service of the public.” The chiefs will say the argument that policing reflects biases in society is not good enough: “Policing has a much higher obligation than any other public service, given its ability to deprive liberty and use the most intrusive powers. The collective trust of society is critical to a police service built upon consent.” Sources involved in discussions said while high on aspiration, the plan risked lacking specifics. Chiefs will adopt a policy of “explain or reform” on racial disparities, such as stop and search, and the plan will say: “Black people are seven times more likely to be stopped and searched than White people and five times more likely to be subjected to the use of force. Testimonies tell us that Black people find these encounters – particularly stop and search – confrontational, stigmatising and humiliating. “10% of our recorded searches, 27% of use-of-force incidents and 35% of Taser incidents involved someone from a Black ethnic group. The latest estimates suggest that only 3.5% of the population is Black.” Chiefs have brought in independent scrutiny and the public will be encouraged to give their views on the plan. The plan is produced by the NPCC and College of Policing and will now be consulted upon and may change. They state their aim is: “Our vision is for a police service that is anti-racist and trusted by Black people.”",News/UK news,"Police chiefs to apologise for ‘racism, discrimination and bias’ in race plan",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/20/police-chiefs-to-apologise-for-racism-discrimination-and-bias-in-race-plan
5/21/2022,"The ATP has decided to punish Wimbledon for its decision to ban Russian and Belarusian players from the tournament by stripping ranking points from the tournament this year. The decision marks the most significant split among the tennis governing bodies in a long time. It means that Wimbledon will essentially be rendered an exhibition event in the ATP tennis ecosystem, with players unable to earn the ranking points this year as they do at all other official tournaments in the year. Those who performed well at last year’s edition will be unable to defend their points, meaning there could be significant disruption to the rankings. The WTA’s decision is imminent. “The ability for players of any nationality to enter tournaments based on merit, and without discrimination, is fundamental to our Tour,” said the ATP in a statement. “The decision by Wimbledon to ban Russian and Belarusian players from competing in the UK this summer undermines this principle and the integrity of the ATP Ranking system. It is also inconsistent with our Rankings agreement. Absent a change in circumstances, it is with great regret and reluctance that we see no option but to remove ATP Ranking points from Wimbledon for 2022. The statement continued: “Our rules and agreements exist in order to protect the rights of players as a whole. Unilateral decisions of this nature, if unaddressed, set a damaging precedent for the rest of the Tour. Discrimination by individual tournaments is simply not viable on a Tour that operates in more than 30 countries.” Additionally, the ITF has announced the removal of points from the Juniors and Wheelchair tournaments at Wimbledon: “Tournament organisers are not permitted to unilaterally impose entry criteria inconsistent with the ITF’s published open entry criteria,” said the ITF in a statement. “Therefore, in accordance with its protocols, the ITF has the right to withdraw ranking points.” In April, Wimbledon announced that they would not allow Russian or Belarusian players to compete at the tournament in light of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The All England Club cited the possibility of the Russian government using any Russian player’s success as propaganda during the invasion and the British government’s guidelines as reasons for the decision. The ATP responded firmly by accusing Wimbledon of violating their agreements and discriminating against players since athletes compete as individuals in tennis. With the significant popularity and revenue generated by grand slam tournaments, withholding ranking points is one of the few options the tours have to exert power over Wimbledon. Russian and Belarusian players have been allowed elsewhere as neutral athletes and they will be present at the French Open, which begins on Sunday. The ATP continued: “We greatly value our long-standing relationships with Wimbledon and the LTA and do not underestimate the difficult decisions faced in responding to recent UK Government guidance. However, we note that this was informal guidance, not a mandate, which offered an alternative option that would have left the decision in the hands of individual players competing as neutral athletes through a signed declaration.” The Guardian understands that there is a significant split among players over both Wimbledon’s initial decision and the reaction from the tennis governing bodies. While some players have previously registered their discomfort at Wimbledon’s initial decision and the ATP player council recommended the withdrawal of ranking points, around 90 players have opposed the points deduction, with some writing to the tours and criticising the player councils for not representing their views. Despite the LTA’s decision to follow Wimbledon’s lead by refusing entry to players in the ATP and WTA lead-up events, the ATP have also opted to maintain points at the British warm-up tournaments. The men’s tennis governing body additionally affirmed that the LTA will face disciplinary action for breaching their contract. Daniil Medvedev, the ATP No 2 and highest profile player unable to compete at Wimbledon, gave his perspective towards the ban during his press conference on Friday: “I’m not in ATP taking the decisions, I’m not in Wimbledon taking the decisions. Maybe it’s government pushing them, maybe it’s their decision. There a lot of mistakes behind this. So if I can play I’m going to be happy to play. I love Wimbledon as a tournament. He added: “But if I cannot play, I’m gonna try to play next year’s and try to play good there.”",Sport/Sport,Wimbledon stripped of ranking points over ban on Russian players,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/20/wimbledon-stripped-of-ranking-points-over-banning-of-russian-players-tennis
5/21/2022,"Nadine Dorries’ claim that a Channel 4 reality show she appeared on used paid actors is “unfounded”, according to the production company that made the show. The culture secretary told parliament on Thursday that she believes the 2010 show ‘Tower Block of Commons’, in which she was one of a number of MPs who went to live in deprived communities, used paid actors to play supposedly real people. Her claim is of deep concern to Channel 4 as Dorries is currently trying to push through the privatisation of the state-owned but commercially funded broadcaster. Any suggestion that a show she appeared on might have been faked could have severe consequences for the broadcaster’s future. Dorries told the culture select committee on Thursday that she thought the show had hired paid actors for the programme. On the reality show Dorries was sent to live in South Acton estate in west London, sparking a minor scandal when the MP was revealed to have smuggled in a £50 note, which she claimed was intended to buy gifts for the children of her hosts. She told parliament she believed the hosts were planted by the show’s producers. “I discovered later, they were actually actors,” she told MPs. “The parents of the boys in that programme actually came here to have lunch with me, and contacted me to tell me, actually, they were in acting school, and that they weren’t really living in a flat, and they weren’t real. And even, if you remember, there’s a pharmacist or somebody that I went to see who prepared food – she was also a paid actress as well.” Love Productions, which made the programme and also makes The Great British Bake Off, said it believed her allegation was false but pledged to investigate if the culture secretary had any evidence. A spokesperson said: “Love Productions does not use actors to impersonate contributors in any of its documentary or constructed factual series. Nadine Dorries took part in the making of Tower Block of Commons for Channel 4 alongside other genuine contributors, and we are confident that her claims are unfounded. “Nevertheless, we take the allegations seriously and will investigate thoroughly. We also await Nadine Dorries’ reply to Channel 4’s request for evidence to back up her comments.” Dorries told parliament that Channel 4 would be privatised, despite widespread opposition from the media industry. Channel 4 has also pushed back hard on some of her other evidence to the select committee, including her claim that the broadcaster is not invested in the government’s levelling up programme and her suggestion Channel 5 spends more on regional commissioning.",News/Politics,Production outfit refutes Nadine Dorries’ claims Channel 4 faked reality show,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/20/production-outfit-refutes-nadine-dorries-claims-channel-4-faked-reality-show
5/21/2022,"Boris Johnson is among dozens of No 10 officials warned by Sue Gray they are facing criticism in her Partygate report next week, as a former civil service chief said the “real issue” was the leadership of the prime minister and his cabinet secretary, Simon Case. Johnson is one of 20 to 30 current and former staffers who have been notified by letter that accounts of their conduct will feature in her final report on the lockdown-busting parties. This is now likely to be published next week after Scotland Yard handed out 126 fixed-penalty notices to people from No 10, including one for Johnson but many for more junior staff. Whitehall sources said the report was likely to be heavily critical of the culture that arose in the civil service, which Johnson has attempted partly to address this week with a shake-up of his No 10 operation to bring more under his own control. However, Bob Kerslake, a crossbench peer and former leader of the civil service, said Partygate was “about conduct and behaviours that can’t be dealt with by changing structures”. He said: “It could improve efficiency but I’m not sure that in itself could have altered the course of events when the real issue was the leadership at the top, truthfully with the prime minister, and I have to say potentially with the cabinet secretary but until we see Sue’s report it is hard to make that judgment.” Case is not among those who received a fixed penalty, despite a party in his office having been under investigation. He was due to appear at the public administration committee next week but has pulled out, leading its Tory chairman, William Wragg, to say it “puts government transparency in a poor light”. He added: “The session with the cabinet secretary was an important one considering the number of propriety and ethics issues on the agenda.” The cabinet secretary, who formerly headed up the civil service in No 10, is the subject of considerable anger among officials, many of whom feel they have been unfairly penalised after cooperating with the Gray report – unlike their superiors. Gary Graham, a deputy general secretary of the Prospect union, suggested in a BBC interview on Friday that the prime minister should consider his position. He said the key issue in the Gray report should be “who were the key decision-makers in No 10 and who set the culture … there were a number of quite catastrophic decisions made at senior level, including by the prime minister, and those should not be put at the door of junior staff.” A spokesperson for the PCS, the union that represents 80,000 civil servants and will next week vote on national strike action, was also highly critical of the way junior civil servants appeared to have been punished for events that were known about by more senior staff. “It’s one rule for the prime minister, cabinet ministers and senior civil servants who organised the Downing Street parties, another for junior staffers,” he said. “Once again, this government shows little – or no – respect to our members who worked so hard keeping the country going during the pandemic.” Whitehall sources said No 10 had been pressing for Gray’s report to be published as early as Monday, giving those sent warning letters the weekend to respond if they wish. But the report is understood to be more likely to come midweek, given some of the recipients of warning letters may want to challenge the findings or even hire lawyers to dispute any facts. Not all of those sent a letter will be named, but they have been sent summaries of how their conduct is portrayed in the report. No 10 said on Friday it was not blocking the release of any names, which are likely to be at senior civil service level only. After Gray’s report is published and Johnson makes a statement to the Commons giving his own account of the Partygate saga, the prime minister is keen to turn public attention to his government’s response to the cost of living crisis. He told the Conservative conference in Wales on Friday that he wanted to “use the firepower we have built up to put our arms around people, just as we did during the pandemic”. There had been speculation that No 10 and No 11 could come to an agreement on help for households, including measures to help people with bills, by the middle of next week. But despite Johnson’s hint of help to come, a Treasury source played down the idea of an imminent move, suggesting it was unlikely an announcement from Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, would come before the House of Commons rises for a Whitsun recess next Thursday. “Rishi is still looking at a whole variety of options, and hasn’t settled yet on what the best way forward is: we’re a bit of a way off,” the source said. Options under consideration include an expansion of the existing warm homes discount, which cuts the energy bills of the poorest consumers; another one-off payment like the council tax cut that came into force in April; or much more costly across-the-board interventions such as a VAT cut, or bringing forward the income tax reduction planned for 2024. With a potential delay to the announcement on cost of living, Conservative backbenchers are concerned about political drift, and have urged Johnson’s team to “knuckle down” in the weeks ahead. “There’s a lot of frustration that although there are some departments doing good things, there’s nothing that threads it all together: there’s no central theme, there’s no central purpose,” said one former minister. “If I were in No 10, instead of feeling exuberant I would be knuckling down.” MPs expressed bemusement at the Met’s handling of the investigation, with one describing what they called colleagues’ “general mystification”, adding: “It does seem very unclear as to how some people at the same event have been fined and not others.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson among dozens warned they face criticism in Sue Gray’s report,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/20/boris-johnson-among-dozens-warned-face-criticism-sue-gray-report-partygate
5/21/2022,"Ginni Thomas, the wife of the US supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, pressed Republicans in Arizona to overturn Joe Biden’s victory there in 2020, the Washington Post reported. Repeating Donald Trump’s lie that the vote had been marred by fraud, Thomas wrote: “Please stand strong in the face of political and media pressure. Please reflect on the awesome authority granted to you by our constitution. And then please take action to ensure that a clean slate of electors is chosen for our state.” Thomas did not mention Biden or Trump. But, the Post said, “the context was clear”. Biden won Arizona, a swing state vital to the contest, by about 10,000 votes. The call was first made by Fox News, enraging Trump. Ginni Thomas is an activist with deep ties on the Republican far right. Reports of her involvement in Trump’s attempt to hold on to power have led to calls for her husband’s impeachment and removal, or at least recusal from election-related cases. In January, Thomas was the only justice to say Trump should be able to withhold from the House committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack documents which turned out to include texts sent by his wife to Trump’s chief of staff. On Friday, the Post said Ginni Thomas emailed two Arizona Republicans on 9 November, six days after election day and two days after Biden’s win was called. She also requested a live or online meeting “so I can learn more about what you are doing to ensure our state’s vote is audited and our certification is clean”. One of the lawmakers, Shawnna Bolick, replied, saying, “I hope you and Clarence are doing great!” but deflecting the demand for a meeting. The Post said Thomas replied: “Fun that this came to you! Just part of our campaign to help states feel America’s eyes!!!” The Post also reported that Thomas emailed the same Republicans on 13 December, a day before the electoral college met to confirm Biden’s victory. That email said: “Before you choose your state’s electors … consider what will happen to the nation we all love if you don’t stand up and lead.” The Post said the email contained a link to a video of a man who appeared to be Geoffrey Botkin, an activist, “delivering a message meant for swing-state lawmakers, urging them to ‘put things right’ and ‘not give in to cowardice’ [and saying] ‘You have only hours to act’.” The video is no longer available. Botkin did not comment to the newspaper. Nor did Ginni Thomas. The Post said a supreme court spokesperson did not respond. On 14 December, the day the electoral college confirmed Biden’s win, Bolick signed a letter calling for Arizona’s electoral votes to go to Trump or “be nullified completely until a full forensic audit can be conducted”. In 2021, Arizona Republicans conducted a controversial vote audit. It did not reveal substantial electoral fraud. It did increase Biden’s margin of victory. Also in 2021, the New Yorker reported that Bolick had introduced a bill that “would enable a majority of the legislature to override the popular vote … and dictate the state’s electoral college votes itself”. Like Trump loyalists elsewhere, Bolick is now running for secretary of state, the office which runs elections. On Friday, the New Yorker reporter Jane Meyer tweeted “one additional detail”, linking Ginni Thomas’s moves in Arizona back to her husband. Clarence Thomas, Meyer said, is godfather “to Clint Bolick’s child, and Bolick’s wife is the Arizona lawmaker who Ginni Thomas pressured to overturn the 2020 election. “No conflicts of interest?”",News/US news,Ginni Thomas reportedly urged Arizona Republicans to overturn 2020 result,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/20/ginni-thomas-2020-election-arizona-emails
5/21/2022,"The horrors associated with a violent mob rampaging around the US Capitol last year meant a subsequent decision relating to a golf tournament barely registered. Donald Trump’s Bedminster golf course had been announced as the 2022 US PGA Championship’s host venue in 2014. With Trump caught in the middle of the Capitol storm, the PGA of America changed its plan, and Southern Hills in Tulsa, Oklahoma was the beneficiary at short notice. “We find ourselves in a political situation not of our making,” said Seth Waugh, the PGA of America’s chief executive. “We’re fiduciaries for our members, for the game, for our mission and for our brand. And how do we best protect that? Our feeling was given the tragic events that we could no longer hold it at Bedminster. “The damage could have been irreparable. The only real course of action was to leave.” It was a fine call then, just as it is now. Trump, once such an advocate of the PGA Tour, has shuffled off to form a dubious alliance with Saudi Arabia. His Doral course in Miami will stage the closing event of this year’s LIV Golf Series, funded by the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund. The partnership feels perfectly appropriate. If there is a widespread and a perfectly reasonable sense that golf has suffered through the R&A’s understandable refusal to stage the Open Championship at Trump-owned Turnberry, this US PGA switch has been an unquestionable success. Southern Hills was a strong course in 2001 and 2007 – when it staged the US Open and US PGA respectively – but has been elevated by changes overseen by the renowned course architect Gil Hanse. Days one and two in Tulsa have seen every facet of golf tested; as is precisely the way it should be in a major. The showcasing of this course to a broader audience has been entirely worthwhile. “We were trying to be truthful to the original design,” said Hanse of his Southern Hills project. He had used old photographs with that in mind. This largely related to the restoration of slopes around greens, as were created by the original architect of this course, Perry Maxwell. With typical modesty, Hanse has said he does not want his “fingerprints” visible here. Instead a sense of: “This is what Perry Maxwell did.” Hanse, though, is the name on every player’s lips. “Gil has done a fantastic job of altering the golf course,” said Tiger Woods. “It has a lot more shot options, that’s for sure, and we are tested around the greens a lot. A lot of grain, a lot of creativity, but it still puts a premium in putting the ball in play and in the fairway and somehow below the holes in the right spots.” In short, one dimensional golf is not an option. Bunkers are to be avoided. They are designed to penalise loose shots, after all. The sand at Southern Hills is more gritty than players are used to, as has triggered some noticeably poor attempts to get balls close to pins. “I am sure people have seen from watching the coverage how difficult it is to get spin, basically impossible,” explained Justin Thomas. “Some bunker shots that are generally pretty easy or guaranteed up-and-downs? That is definitely not the case this week.” It is the job of Kerry Haigh, the PGA of America’s chief championships officer, to set the course up. He is delighted with his platform. “They did an incredible job,” Haigh said of Hanse and his team. “They did a lot of different things, widened the landing areas of the fairways. They moved some of the bunkers back. They added five or six new tees for the back. “It provides a lot more shot options, a lot more shot variety, a lot more options to hit woods or drivers off the tee. If I’m a player, I’m going to enjoy playing what it offers.” Not that everyone has been in a positive state of mind. Scottie Scheffler, the world No 1, cracked his bag with a club in fit of pique yesterday morning. Dustin Johnson was hurtling towards a missed cut. As the wind whipped up, Thomas, Matt Fitzpatrick and Joaquín Niemann stood firm to keep pressure on Rory McIlroy before the Northern Irishman appeared for his afternoon tee time. The severity of the test on the morning of day two was emphasised by Woods, who moved up 17 spots on the leaderboard within five hours of play getting underway and without hitting a single shot.",Sport/Sport,Switching PGA courses after mob rampage a success for all bar Trump,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/20/switching-pga-courses-after-mob-rampage-a-success-for-all-bar-trump
5/21/2022,"A woman who was terrorised by an MI5 agent with a background in rightwing extremism is taking legal action against the security service. Beth, not her real name, claimed the man, her former partner, attacked her with a machete and threatened to kill her. The agent – known only as X for legal reasons – is a foreign national who worked as a paid informant for MI5 infiltrating extremist networks in the UK. He used his security status to coercively control the woman, telling her that she would be killed if she reported his abusive behaviour, according to an investigation by the BBC. Beth has now launched a legal complaint with the Investigatory Powers Tribunal, the watchdog for the intelligence agencies, the Centre for Women’s Justice (CWJ) reported. The CWJ said it was acting for Beth “in a formal complaint, and linked human rights claim” and “also exploring action against a police force who have failed to take action against the perpetrator despite repeated reports”. The BBC was only able to tell the British woman’s story on Thursday after winning a high court battle with the government. But it was blocked from disclosing information likely to identify the man, who is said to be a covert human intelligence source (Chis). The government said disclosing his identity would threaten national security and endanger his life. The man is said to have praised white supremacist mass murderers and even said that he wanted to commit a similar act of violence. Beth said he sexually assaulted her, and was also abusive and coercive. He once attacked her with a machete and said he would kill her, as shown on a video captured on her mobile phone. Police did investigate the attack but the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) dropped the case as it came to court. Beth said the police did not take a full statement from her or obtain the mobile video of the incident. The police force, which has not been named, and the CPS said the case was discontinued for lack of evidence. The CWJ said Beth will argue that MI5’s conduct may have breached her human rights, “in that by recruiting and affording protection to X, they were effectively enabling X to subject her to serious violence and abuse with impunity”. It added: “Beth is asking the Investigatory Powers Tribunal to investigate MI5’s recruitment and handling of X, and whether any steps were taken to address the clear risk of harm that he posed.” In a statement released by the organisation, Beth said: “Above all, I hope that this will cause the police to reopen the case against X and actually do something about his crimes, none of which have been properly investigated. I have fought tooth and nail over the last few years to get the police to take me seriously, but all for nothing. No one should have to experience the lack of empathy that the police have shown me.” Her solicitor Kate Ellis said her case “raises a number of issues regarding the state’s protection – whether intentionally or through neglect – of those who hold extreme misogynistic views and pose a risk of serious violence towards women and girls”. The shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said there needed to be an “independent assessment” of how the “troubling” case was handled. “Domestic abuse is an appalling and dangerous crime and victims need to know that it will always be taken immensely seriously by all agencies, especially those responsible for keeping us safe,” she said. The government previously said it would not comment on security or intelligence.",News/UK news,Woman terrorised by MI5 agent takes legal action against service,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/20/woman-terrorised-by-mi5-agent-takes-legal-action-against-service
5/21/2022,"Leicester host Southampton in a game that could be perceived as a dead rubber but for Brendan Rodgers it is a chance to finish a challenging season on a high. Victory at home to Southampton could be enough to secure eighth, which Rodgers maintains would be an impressive achievement all things considered, his side reaching the semi-finals of the inaugural Europa Conference League. Meanwhile, a first win in six games would lift the mood at Southampton before the summer. “Apart from the top six and West Ham being above us, who have supposedly had a fantastic season, then it shows you how well these players have done,” Rodgers said.
