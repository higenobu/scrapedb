3/17/2022,"In a regular scheduled Caddo Parish School Board meeting, parents met in opposition and support of a University Elementary School teacher, who identifies as nonbinary. Action regarding Blaine Banghart was not on the agenda and was not addressed by the board. Nevertheless, the public comment period devolved into arguments and yelling over the dress code and this educator. Banghart is a music teacher at University Elementary School in Shreveport who uses the term MX, as opposed to Mr. or Ms. The teacher received pushback and support after posting a video on TikTok about their inability to be out at work.

Brandy Pou with UnMask our Kids Louisiana took to Facebook on Monday asking all parents to come out in opposition of Banghart at the Tuesday evening meeting. The Shreveport Times reached out to Banghart, but they declined to comment. As people entered the meeting chamber at 4 p.m. Tuesday, a clear divide was apparent. Individuals appeared to seat themselves in factions â€” to the left, brightly-dressed Banghart supporters and to the right, their opposition. Before opening the floor to public comments, board President Tony Nations warned the audience that ""derogatory statements"" made toward board members or employees would not be tolerated.

""Obviously, that is ridiculous and would be breaking the dress code, this teacher was not. The picture in question that circulated on the internet had this teacher fully covered in a cardigan, blouse and pants. There is nothing wrong with that. Moving on from that, they talked about the student handbook, keyword 'student.'"" By the middle of the public comment period, the room was full, and people from both sides were speaking out of turn while those at the podium addressed the board. Keith Hanson, Chief Technology Officer for Shreveport spoke in support of Banghart. ""I have never spoken here as a citizen or parent of a student, but I am here today because this is important to me, my family and, most importantly, to her,"" he said. ""Let everyone see on public record that there are good people here ready to defend other good people from vile, bigoted hate."" Makenzie Boucher is a reporter with the Shreveport Times.
