3/21/2022,"Have the markets turned the corner? Maybe not – but maybe so, at least for the short term. Despite rising inflation in the States, and Russia’s continuing war against Ukraine, high prices for oil, and disruptions in the global commodity markets, Wall Street just finished its best week since November of 2020. Between March 14 and March 18, the S&P 500 rose ~6%, while the NASDAQ was up ~9%. Investors were clearly in a buying mood, and the indexes reflected it. However, some Wall Street pros are understandably concerned that the market is still vulnerable. In this environment, investors are going to gravitate toward stocks that have proven records of strong share price appreciation. While we all know that past performance won’t guarantee future results, the best place to start looking for tomorrow’s high-growth stocks is among yesterday’s winners. Using TipRanks’ database, we’ve found three ‘monster growth’ names that saw hefty gains over the past 12 months. Each name is well-loved by Wall Street analysts, and has received enough bullish calls to score a “Strong Buy” consensus rating. Golar LNG Limited (GLNG) We’ll start in the energy industry, where Golar LNG has exploited some economic quirks of the natural gas industry to become a leader in the liquified natural gas sector. The company specializes in the building and operation of floating natural gas liquefaction facilities, a niche that makes it possible to exploit previously non-economic gas reserves. Natural gas must be liquefied for safe long-distance transport, and Golar brings the liquefaction facilities to the gas fields – and can move those facilities when necessary. Golar boasts that its floating gas liquefaction fleet can operation at a lower cost than land-based facilities. High energy prices, and particularly rising prices for natural gas on the global market, has been good for Golar. The company has seen its share price rise 70% so far this year. A quick look at the company’s earnings will show the extent of the growth, and the potential. In 4Q21, Golar showed $93.5 million in EBITDA, up from $78 million in the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, the gain was higher; Q3’s result had been $74.5 million. BTIG analyst Gregory Lewis sees Golar in a strong position to gain additional business, writing: “We believe we are on the cusp of a multi-year run in LNG project FIDs (Final Investment Decision) as we expect natural gas to serve as a bridge fuel as the world shifts to renewable energy over the next few decades. And more importantly… Golar has a much improved capital structure (~$500M in current liquidity to go after its next flexible Floating LNG (FLNG) project which includes ~$250M in cash), an existing base of LNG assets which could be FLNG conversion projects, and FLNG solutions, which we think positions the company to win multiple FLNG projects over the next two years.” These comments support Lewis’s Buy rating, while his $30 price target on GLNG stock implies ~43% upside for the coming year. (To watch Lewis’ track record, click here) Overall, Golar’s Strong Buy analyst consensus rating is based on 8 recent stock reviews, that include 6 to Buy and 2 to Hold. The shares are priced at $21.02, and their $22.81 average price target indicates an 8.5% upside from that level. (See GLNG stock analysis on TipRanks) Matador Resources Company (MTDR) Sticking with the energy sector, we’ll turn our view to Matador Resources. This company engages in hydrocarbon exploration, development, and extraction, focusing on unconventional plays in the North American oil and natural gas industries. Matador has is primary operations in the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring plays the Texas-New Mexico Delaware Basin, with additional assets in Northwest Louisiana. Matador’s operations are generating cash as well as hydrocarbons. The company reported $334.5 million in cash from operations for 4Q21, up 15% from Q3, and an even stronger 112% year-over-year. This total included $119.3 million in adjusted free cash flow, nearly double the year-ago quarter’s $60.7 million. The steady growth in cash flow prompted Matador to increase its quarterly dividend this past fall, and to maintain the higher payment this month. The last dividend, paid out on March 14, was for 5 cents per common share. This annualizes to 20 cents, and gives a modest yield 0f 0.3%. The key point here is not the yield, but the combination of management’s statement of intent to increase the returns to shareholders along with the company’s strong cash flow generation. It’s important to note here that MTDR shares have gained 118% in the past 12 months. Neil Dingmann, 5-star analyst from Truist, writes of Matador: “We believe Matador has done a notable job of creating value in its ten year existence... By our estimates, the company continues to be set up for solid upcoming production/cash flow/stock price growth despite the strong share performance already seen in the past several months. We have high confidence of continued strong well performance in the ~70 wells to be turned to sales this year given the continued operational efficiencies/outperformance previously demonstrated.” Dingmann’s bullish stance comes with a Buy rating on the stock, while his $68 price target suggests Matador has room for ~29% upside growth by the end of this year. (To watch Dingmann’s track record, click here) There are seven recent reviews of Matador shares on record and they all agree that this is one to buy, making the Strong Buy consensus unanimous. The stock is selling for $52.81 and its $62 average price target implies ~17% one-year upside. (See MTDR stock analysis on TipRanks) Intra-Cellular Therapies (ITCI) Let’s shift gears now, and turn to the biopharmaceutical industry. Intra-Cellular Therapies is a clinical- and commercial-stage research company developing new treatments for mental health disorders in adults. This is a field with, in the jargon, ‘high unmet medical needs.’ Mental health diseases place a heavy burden on both patients and caregivers, and treatments currently available suffer from both poor success rates, high con-compliance rates with treatment, dangerous or undesirable side effects – or all of that combined. This gives Intra-Cellular an opening, if it can get a more effective drug to market. The company is on the cusp of that. In December of last year, the FDA approved ITCI’s leading product, lumateperone (branded as Caplyta) for the treatment of bi-polar depression in adults. This was an important label extension for Caplyta, which has already been approved in December of 2019 as a treatment for adult schizophrenia. Having a drug on the market is the Holy Grail for biopharma companies, and Intra-Cellular has seen a steady – and steadily increasing – revenue stream from Caplyta since its initial approval. In the last quarter reported, 4Q21, Intra-Cellular showed $25.7 million in top-line revenues. This was a 106% jump from the year-ago quarter, and marks the 7th straight quarter of revenue gains since Caplyta went on the market. Shares in ITCI reflect this revenue growth – the stock is up 70% since this time last year. The company is following up on its current success with lumateperone, and has additional clinical trials underway. The drug is being evaluated in a pair of Phase 3 double-blind placebo controlled studies as an adjunctive treatment for major depressive disorder. In addition, Intra-Cellular has three other drug candidates in earlier-stage clinical trials, for conditions ranging from Alzheimer’s and dementia to Parkinson’s and opioid abuse. Covering ITCI for Jefferies, analyst Andrew Tsai writes: “In 2022, we think ITCI stock could break all-time highs despite a challenging tape, as Caplyta scripts are accelerating earlier (and perhaps even faster) than Street expectations… For SCZ/BPD, we can derive a valuation of $6-8B + (or $65-85/sh) by applying a 3-4x multiple to our above-cons $2B peak sales estimate, though this thinking is perhaps conservative and excludes the Phase II/III pipeline (which deserves credit). Bottom line, a healthy balance sheet (we est Q1 cash of $750M +), a strong narrative (clean story), and meaningful upside potential (SCZ/BPD plus pipeline optionality) drive scarcity value, leading us to think ITCI stock should continue outperforming this year.” In line with this upbeat outlook, Tsai rates the stock a Buy, and his $90 price target implies an upside of 47% this year. (To watch Tsai’s track record, click here) Tsai is hardly the only bull on this stock; ITCI has a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating supported by 9 analyst reviews. The average price target of $68.67 gives a 12% upside potential from the current share price of $61.05.

3/21/2022,"(Reuters) - Australia has imposed an immediate ban on exports of alumina and aluminum ores, including bauxite, to Russia, the government said on Sunday as part of its ongoing sanctions against Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. ""Russia relies on Australia for nearly 20 percent of its alumina needs,"" the Australian government said in a joint statement from several ministries, including the prime minister's office. It added that the move will limit Russia's capacity to produce aluminium, which is a critical export for Russia. ""The Government will work closely with exporters and peak bodies that will be affected by the ban to find new and expand existing markets,"" the statement said. Anglo-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto owns an 80% stake in Queensland Alumina Ltd (QAL) in a joint venture with Russia's Rusal International PJSC, the world's second-largest aluminum producer. Last week, Australia imposed sanctions on two Russian businessmen with links to its mining industry, one of them being billionaire Oleg Deripaska who holds stakes in QAL. Australia has so far imposed a total of 476 sanctions on 443 individuals, including businessmen close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and 33 entities, including most of Russia’s banking sector and all entities responsible for the country's sovereign debt, the statement said. The government also said it will donate at least 70,000 tonnes of thermal coal to Ukraine to meet its energy needs. Australian coal producers have been bombarded with calls for supply over the past few weeks from Ukraine and other countries like Poland that have been reliant on Russian supplies. ""The Australian Government has worked with the Australian coal industry to source supplies,"" the statement said. Whitehaven Coal has quickly arranged a shipment, and the Government is now working with the company and the Ukrainian and Polish Governments to deliver the supplies at the earliest available opportunity, the statement said. The government also pledged additional military equipment and humanitarian aid for Ukraine.

3/21/2022,"NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA) posted outstanding gains last week, lifting more than 25% to a four-week high. The turnaround erupted at the 200-day moving average, raising hopes for a sustained bottom and end of the downtrend that started in November. However, long-term cycles are refusing to cooperate, suggesting a buzzsaw of selling pressure as price action navigates the 270s and 280s. PHLX Semiconductor Index is flashing the same message, squeezing higher after a rapid descent to a 10-month low. Supply chain issues persistent throughout the industry while the Russian invasion will make it harder to obtain some fabrication materials. China’s obsession with Taiwan isn’t helping matters because that small nation dominates the world’s foundry market, building chips for tech giants that include NVDA, Apple Inc. (AAPL), and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM). Cowen analyst Matthew Ramsay examined the company’s long-term growth last week, noting “As NVIDIA has transformed from a GPU hardware company to an accelerated computing HW/SW platform provider, and now we would argue into an application-specific compute (including NPU and CPUs) and software ecosystem, sizing these opportunities has inevitably become more complex… Given the significant pullback YTD and the correspondingly more attractive valuations, we make NVIDIA our new top pick”. Wall Street consensus stands at an ‘Overweight’ rating based upon 30 ‘Buy’, 6 ‘Overweight’, 6 ‘Hold’, 1 ‘Underweight’, and 2 ‘Sell’ recommendations. Price targets currently range from a low of $210 to a Street-high $400 while the stock closed Friday’s session about $75 below the median $350 target. Targets and ratings have barely budged in the last three months because Omicron and Ukraine have made it harder for the stock to resume its long-term leadership role. NVIDIA settled near 150 in September 2020 and carved a narrow trading range, ahead of a May 2021 breakout that hit an all-time high at 346.47 in November. It broke down from a small head and shoulders top in January, entering a correction that reached the 200-day moving average a few weeks later. The stock has been testing that support level for the last two months, lifting weekly relative strength readings into a buy cycle.

3/21/2022,"By Julie Ingwersen and P.J. Huffstutter CHICAGO (Reuters) - After Russia's invasion of Ukraine sent global wheat futures soaring, U.S. farmer Vance Ehmke was eager to sell his grain. Local prices shot up roughly 30% to nearly $12 a bushel, about the highest Ehmke could recall in 45 years of farming near the western Kansas town of Healy. Instead of reaping a windfall, Ehmke found a commodities market turned upside down. He and his wife Louise told Reuters they couldn't sell a nickel of their upcoming summer wheat harvest for future delivery. Futures prices for corn and wheat had rocketed so abruptly that many along the complex chain of grain handling - local farm cooperatives, grain elevators, flour millers and exporters - stopped buying for fear they couldn't resell at a profit. Others couldn't afford an industry-wide risk-management strategy known as hedging that keeps global commodities markets moving. Missiles falling in Ukraine had rocked that system, sending middlemen scrambling to shore up positions in the futures market that were costing them millions of dollars per day. ""More than anything, the market is just in a panic,"" Andrew Jackson, a Kentucky grain merchandiser, told Reuters. Many of these players continue to hold back on purchases to see how the Eastern European conflict shakes out: Russia is the world's top wheat exporter and Ukraine is a major global supplier of both wheat and corn. While some North American millers have said they have enough grain on hand from past harvests to continue producing for several months, prolonged or repeated disruptions to grain trading could eventually contribute to already-inflated food prices. Meanwhile, the inability to sell some of their winter wheat - whose harvest starts in June - is putting the squeeze on U.S. farmers. Growers like the Ehmkes need cash now to pay for seed and fertilizer ahead of spring planting, as well as for land rent and tax bills coming due. Fertilizer bills alone are expected to jump 12% this year, after rising 17% last year, according to American Farm Bureau Federation and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) data. If American farmers decide to cut back, that could curb yields for the fall harvest at a time when the world may soon need more grain. Developing countries are particularly vulnerable to supply shortages and high grain prices, said Don Roose, president of agricultural broker U.S. Commodities in Iowa. ""Emerging markets like Africa could have less bread to eat,"" Roose said. SHORTS VS LONGS The unusual situation that throttled the Ehmkes stems from the system of hedging that U.S. grain growers and processors have long used to insure themselves against price swings. For every bushel of grain they commit to buy, purchasers sell an equal amount of bushels in the futures market as a hedge to protect themselves against losses. These commercial players are the traditional ""shorts,"" or sellers, in the futures market. On the other side are futures buyers, or ""longs."" These players typically are speculators such as hedge funds and investment banks not involved in the physical grain-handling business. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, which Moscow dubbed a ""special operation,"" speculators aggressively bought wheat and corn futures, especially the nearby May contracts. The price of May wheat on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) jumped 54% in just nine trading days, from $8.84-3/4 per bushel on Feb. 23 to $13.63-1/2 on March 8. Russia and Ukraine together supply about 26% of the world's wheat exports, according to the latest USDA data. Shipments through the Black Sea have already been disrupted. When futures shoot higher, commercial grain sellers accrue paper losses on their short positions. That's not necessarily a disaster, as the physical grain they have purchased is rising in value too. But until they can sell the grain and close their futures positions, they can get squeezed financially. In recent weeks, many have faced so-called margin calls from their futures brokers, forcing them to inject enormous sums into their commodity trading accounts to cover their losses. ""It's a massive headache that could turn into a problem if they do not have their financial house in order,"" said Chad Hart, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University. CALLING THE BANKER The wheat rally clobbered buyers of other crops, too. Landus Cooperative, the largest agriculture cooperative in Iowa, briefly suspended its cash bids to buy corn and soybeans on March 9. Chief Executive Matt Carstens said Landus also tripled its credit line with CoBank, a top U.S. agricultural lender, to cover hundreds of millions of dollars in margin calls during the rally and ensure its business remained healthy. CoBank has delivered more than $4.5 billion in loans and credit to customers to deal with margin calls and grain purchases in January and February alone, Eric Itambo, CoBank's chief banking officer, told Reuters. Though spot CBOT wheat futures have cooled in recent days, slipping back below $11 a bushel, the futures market has not been this volatile since 2008, when food shortages worldwide sparked riots in some countries. Back in Kansas, the Ehmkes are eyeing a worsening drought that is hurting the winter wheat crop currently in the ground. Still, they think they might get another chance to sell wheat at $12 or more with the Ukraine conflict showing no sign of abating. ""Just a whole bunch of things are telling us the price of wheat could be substantially higher than what it is right now,"" Vance Ehmke said. (Reporting by Julie Ingwersen in Chicago, and P.J.

3/21/2022,"Drivers around the nation are beginning to shift their driving habits in response to soaring gas prices as the White House attempts to present the pain at the pump in a full context. As of March 19, the national average gas price was $4.26 a gallon. And while that has come down a few pennies from a week ago, U.S. drivers are ""without a doubt"" making lifestyle changes to adapt to higher fuel costs, Robert Sinclair Jr., the AAA Northeast Public Affairs Senior Manager, told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). According to a recent AAA survey, 59% of Americans surveyed said they change their driving habits once gas prices cross $4 per gallon. Should the national average rise beyond $5 a gallon — which is already the case in some states — three in four respondents said they would need to make adjustments. ""We're seeing that consumers are having real sticker shock,"" Vectis Energy Partners Principal Tamar Essner recently said on Yahoo Finance Live. ""And the question is: Does the sticker shock translate into actual demand destruction? And we think in certain parts of the economy that's already happening. In certain parts of the world, that already is."" Lipow Oil Associates President Andrew Lipow told Yahoo Finance Live that ""gasoline prices have to rise to about $4.75 to $5.00 a gallon in order to get a significant amount of demand destruction."" In terms of whether Americans can handle relatively higher gas prices for a while, Essner added: ""Relative to the 1970s, the consumer overall is in a much better space today."" Lipow echoed that view, noting that the U.S. is ""not in a financial crisis. Housing prices are robust. The stock market has been moving up. So the consumer, for the most part, has extra money to spend on gasoline. But they don't like to spend more."" When it comes to changing driving habits, there were some key differences among age groups, the AAA survey found. ""Well, younger drivers, those 34 and younger, about 23% of them said that they would carpool to deal with these higher prices,"" Sinclair said. ""But the older drivers, the older 35 and above, said that they would cut back on spending, going out and to dinner, and making major purchases for appliances and that sort of thing. And they also said they would combine their errands with their commute."" Although carpooling may seem like a smart way to reduce the number of trips to the gas station, Sinclair suggested that it's not so straightforward. ""When you think about it, when I think about it, adding extra people into your vehicle adds weight and will actually reduce your fuel economy,"" Sinclair said. ""So if you're the passenger in carpooling, you're doing great. If you're the driver, you might not be doing so well."" There are many factors contributing to spiking gas prices, which has partly been triggered by a rise in crude oil prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A week after the invasion began, U.S. gas prices surged at a pace not seen since the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. White House officials have called elevated gas prices ""Putin's price hike"" while also explaining that prices aren't actually as high as they seem. President Biden took to Twitter on Wednesday to rail against sticky gas prices despite a recent drop in oil prices. (Gas prices notoriously lag the moves in crude oil.) ""Oil prices are decreasing, gas prices should too,"" Biden tweeted. ""Last time oil was $96 a barrel, gas was $3.62 a gallon. Now it's $4.31. Oil and gas companies shouldn't pad their profits at the expense of hardworking Americans."" Oil prices are decreasing, gas prices should too. Last time oil was $96 a barrel, gas was $3.62 a gallon. Now it’s $4.31.  Oil and gas companies shouldn’t pad their profits at the expense of hardworking Americans. pic.twitter.com/uLNGleWBly — President Biden (@POTUS) March 16, 2022 Noting that gas prices ""go up like a rocket and go down like a feather,"" Sinclair said that while recent hikes in the cost of gas may have peaked, U.S. consumers shouldn't expect much relief going into the summer travel season. ""As the weather gets better, people want to get out and get rid of the COVID doldrums and take a trip somewhere,"" he explained. ""And 85% to 95% of summer holiday trips and summer vacation trips are taken by motor vehicles. So demand goes up. And with it, price."" Edwin is a producer for Yahoo Finance.

Markets have rallied nicely off the early March lows that were triggered by the start of Russia's war on Ukraine, but they are still dealing with a bout of depression. The percentage of individual investors who consider themselves bullish has averaged just 23.9% over the past 10 weeks, according to the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII). Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner points out this is the lowest average level of bullishness since the June 2016 Brexit referendum and one of the least optimistic readings since the survey's inception in 1987. So what has this level of depression historically meant for the stock market in the months ahead? You guessed it, a rally! Historically, these low levels on the survey have been followed by consistent and positive returns on a six- to 12-month basis for the S&P 500, Lerner notes. Only in the land of investing does bad equal good (maybe it does in other places, who knows). ""Part of the market’s resilience can be attributed to depressed investor expectations, which suggests markets are already braced for and discounting some of the known challenges. Markets have also taken the recent shift in Fed policy in stride given investors were already pricing in an aggressive rate path. Historically, the first rate hike tends to inject volatility, but it does not typically end a bull market,"" Lerner explains of the market's recent show of force. All of this bizarre hopefulness could turn on a dime in the current environment, however. President Biden is off to meet with European leaders this week on the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Any headline from that event could send markets tanking, easily. Nike's earnings are out after the close today — the company is a bellwether, so a poor conference call and outlook will not be taken well by investors (chatter on the Street is bracing for a Nike warning). Fed members will likely be talking to the media circuit following their meeting last week, too. But barring a headline disaster, Defiance ETF co-founder Sylvia Jablonski perhaps best summarizes the mindset in the markets that could endure in the near-term. ""Investors are starting to see a tradeable bottom,"" Jablonski said on Yahoo Finance Live. Happy trading! Back on the road: ""Things"" are coming back to New York City after two-plus years of the pandemic, and it's great to see. For my profession, ""things"" often equate to thought-provoking, in-person events/meetings with interesting folks. Two that made their way onto my calendar recently. First, I spent some time with Diageo's CEO Ivan Menezes and his team following an investor day in the city. We were taken around the company's HQ (yes, there is a wraparound bar there) to see what the maker of Don Julio tequila, Guinness beer and other top brands is working on. I (and I think others in attendance) came away very impressed. The company is moving into super premium liquors (think $350 rare tequila that sells out instantly) and alcoholic hard seltzer-like drinks (hard seltzer players such as Boston Beer should be worried). Why Diageo has done well financially in recent quarters despite bars still being hampered by the pandemic truly came to life here. Based on what I saw and convos I had (and considering this could be a strong summer of going out), the stock looks too cheap at 21 times forward earnings. Below is some visual eye candy — the first paper bottle for Johnnie Walker. Another event I hit up was the CEO Summit — hosted by the always charismatic ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott. I won't get into too much detail on this event, except to say I chatted with several software bankers. My general sense is that (1) the sell-offs in high multiple software stocks like Snowflake (and others) may be nearing max exhaustion (useful chart from Jefferies' Brent Thill below to put a finer point on this + see the Thoma Bravo for Anaplan $10.7 billion deal today); and (2) keep an eye on the performance of Amazon Web Services, its cloud dominance is being chipped away at, perhaps more than people think (Microsoft was called out consistently). Charts of the day: Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel occupies this space alone today with two charts on the U.S. consumer. The first shows how consumer confidence is being rattled by the elevated cost of gas. And the other details how current consumer confidence levels suggest an economic slowdown is potentially on the way. The shaded red areas are periods of recession. Influencers speak: Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers has been warning about inflation for some time. “Ultimately we’re going to need 4-5% interest rates, levels they’re not even thinking of as conceivable. They’re recognizing that they’re behind the curve. They’ve still got a long way to go,” Summers told Bloomberg. SoFi CEO Anthony Noto came out swinging on another potential deferment of student loan payments. ""The Biden administration continues to waffle on the issue of federal student loan repayment and possible debt forgiveness,"" Noto said in a blog post. Noto tends to be very measured, so this post caught me off guard — but it makes sense as SoFi is heavily involved in student loans. Recession talk continues. ""I'm higher, but I'm not much higher than 20%,"" former top Obama administration economist Jason Furman told Insider on the odds for a recession. And the hunt for Russian yachts continues. ""Oligarchs help keep Putin in power, so they need to feel the heat for Putin’s war. That’s why we’re going after their yachts, their condos, and all the places they stash their wealth. And that’s why we’ve got to plug this hole in our bucket of sanctions,"" said Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in a new tweet. GameStop: Suffice it to say, our analysis on Yahoo Finance Live of GameStop's ugly quarter came with an aftermath of absurd tweets from the true believers in the name. Most of their tweets cannot be posted here. But I do want to throw this passionate group another analytical bone to devour. GameStop has 4,573 retail stores around the world. Despite that size, the company only spent $62 million for all of 2021 on capital expenditures (think money spent on new fixtures, lights, rugs, basic upkeep, etc.). To get a sense on how paltry that is, here is how much a few other big retailers spent on capex in 2021: Best Buy: 1,144 stores, $737 million Target: 1,926 stores, $3.5 billion Dollar Tree: 16,077 stores, $1 billion Dollar General: 18,170 stores, $1.1 billion Enjoy your breakfast, GME bulls.

3/21/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Dentists, surgeons and other suburban millionaires don’t loom large on the client rosters of buyout funds run by the most elite investment firms. Most Read from Bloomberg Ukraine Update: Zelenskiy Says Some Opposition Parties Suspended Ukraine Update: Biden to Hold Call With European, U.K. Leaders Putin Set a Trap for Ukraine and Walked Right Into It Where Mornings Would Get Darker Under Permanent Daylight Savings Time Russia Uses Hypersonic Weapons as War Enters Bloodier Phase But inside Blackstone Inc., plans are afoot to develop its first private equity fund targeting such individuals as part of a project codenamed “BXPE.” The goal: build new war chests that would eventually gather tens of billions of dollars to invest in deals piped in from various Blackstone teams, according to people with familiar of the matter. The fund would potentially offer multimillionaires exposure to a swath of assets unavailable on public markets, such as Silicon Valley unicorns, closely held corporations and even stakes in other buyout shops, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions aren’t public. In contrast with the usual practice of locking up institutional investors’ money for years, customers would have periodic opportunities to withdraw, the people said. It’s the latest effort by President Jon Gray to expand fundraising beyond pensions, sovereign wealth funds and other sources able to pledge hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in one go. The firm, co-founded by Steve Schwarzman, became an $881 billion financial superstore by helping the biggest institutions chase returns higher than those typically achieved with stocks and bonds. Gray has said individuals are an $80 trillion market. Adding them as customers will bring Blackstone closer to a goal to running $1 trillion. The firm has been hiring executives for the effort, and staff have been carrying out research in the past year on how buyouts can be part of a fund for individual investors. It’s unclear exactly how many millions of dollars someone will need to participate in the fund. Some Blackstone staff had hoped to design a vehicle for accredited investors with as little as about $1 million in net worth, one of the people said. But that’s not on the table. Going so far downmarket would subject the fund to additional regulations, potentially affecting the collection of carried interest and the extent to which it can make private-equity investments. A spokeswoman for the company declined to comment. Blackstone’s plans may still evolve as internal discussions continue and as the industry pushes to loosen rules safeguarding investors from hard-to-sell investments. Blackstone has developed other funds for smaller investors focusing on credit and real estate. Indeed, the New York-based firm already oversees some $200 billion for individuals through wealth managers, bank wirehouses and other channels that connect to smaller investors. Some new money in the past year went to a non-traded real estate investment trust known as BREIT. The fund has snapped up apartments, industrial parks and shopping centers over the past half-decade to become a $54 billion force in the U.S. property market. One reason why private equity firms are pursuing smaller investors is that the institutional fundraising circuit has gotten crowded. A benefit of creating a perpetual vehicle, in which individuals can come and go, is that it creates a longer-term source of fees. While developing BXPE, Blackstone has been thinking through how it will give customers the option to buy and sell stakes in the fund at multiple points in a year, according to the people. The typical buyout fund locks up investor cash for a decade. Blackstone’s executives have been urging regulators to give people more access to investment vehicles previously reserved for the most sophisticated investors. Legal chief John Finley, for example, weighed in before the Securities and Exchange Commission incrementally loosened rules defining accredited investors in 2020. As companies delay selling shares to the public, the number of companies listed on public markets is shrinking, he said in January of that year. “This is a fundamental change that regulators and the industry will have to deal with,” he said.

3/21/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Even investors with a lot at stake tend to agree: The stock market shouldn’t be a president’s top priority, especially when issues like war, blistering inflation and a pandemic are in play. Most Read from Bloomberg Ukraine Update: Zelenskiy Says Some Opposition Parties Suspended Ukraine Update: Biden to Hold Call With European, U.K. Leaders Putin Set a Trap for Ukraine and Walked Right Into It Russia Uses Hypersonic Weapons as War Enters Bloodier Phase Where Mornings Would Get Darker Under Permanent Daylight Savings Time Still, for practical purposes, there’s no getting around the disparity between the styles of Joe Biden and Donald Trump when it comes to the intersection of markets and politics. On Twitter, the favored forum for politicians to boast about accomplishments, Trump posted about stocks dozens of times, treating a rising Dow as an alternative approval rating of his administration. Biden has yet to tweet about the market at all, despite a string of records in his first year in office. Or consider State of the Union addresses. Trump touted a 70% rally during his term. Biden’s only mention of equities was to point out that sanctions stemming from the invasion of Ukraine knocked 40% off the value of Russian stocks and caused that market to close. “I’m not getting the impression that they’re making decisions with the equity market at the forefront of their thinking,” Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, said in an interview. “They’re just looking and making the decisions they think they need to make in terms of domestic policy and foreign policy -- and that is what they’re supposed to do.” At the same time, presidential silence on stocks is part of a shifting landscape for investors, one where they are left to fend for themselves amid a panoply of global threats that stretch well beyond the boundaries of Wall Street. With Biden’s blessing, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has stiffened his resolve against inflation, striking fear into markets everywhere. Tightening sanctions on Russia threaten to whip up price pressures even more. Even Biden himself has made note of the difference in approaches. Before equities fell into a correction this year, he pointed out the strength of the market -- but it was almost as an aside. “By the way, the stock market -- the last guy’s measure of everything -- it’s about 20% higher than it was when my predecessor was there,” he said. “It has hit record after record after record on my watch while making things more equitable for working-class people.” The otherwise lack of emphasis on market performance should not come as a shock to investors, considering that Biden’s platform included boosting corporate taxes and other agenda items that were obviously not aimed at juicing stocks in the short term. What is surprising is how much the stakes have grown, especially as investors also find themselves without the support of accommodating central-bank policy. Biden’s contrasting style came into stark relief last month as Russia prepared for, and then launched, its attack on Ukraine, prompting an aggressive and unprecedented response in the form of financial sanctions from the administration and many U.S. allies. As Biden told Congress earlier this month: “A Russian dictator, invading a foreign country, has costs around the world.” Those costs have included an economically dangerous surge in oil prices and some bone-chilling volatility in the stock market. Now, with Ukraine’s surprising strength in defending its government prompting speculation that Vladimir Putin will seek a peace deal, equities and oil have stabilized for the moment. Yet the shakeup provided investors with some valuable information for the remainder of this presidency. The way Biden views wins and losses in his presidency clearly prioritizes issues he sees as more important -- the lives and well-being of Americans and the defense of allied democracies -- above the performance of financial markets. “Our measure of success is really how real working families are doing,” White House spokeswoman Emilie Simons said Friday. “And we’ve seen a great deal of progress made on that front.” The two presidents also differ on how to handle other important financial issues. Trump took to Twitter to pressure OPEC to boost production when energy prices started getting high, and he repeatedly criticized the Federal Reserve as it raised interest rates seven times during his term. Biden, on the other hand, has chosen more quiet, private diplomacy to urge a boost in oil production to make up for shunned Russia’s crude. He’s also embraced the need for higher interest rates, urging Congress to confirm his nominees to the Federal Reserve because the central bank “plays a critical role in fighting inflation.” “There’s so many other things going on right now that you could argue are much more important to civilization than some of the obstacles that Trump faced,” said Ryan Nauman, market strategist at Zephyr. “And he’s focused more on inflation -- that should be probably his biggest concern, rather than the market.” Another factor to consider going forward is that the shot clock on much of Biden’s agenda could be running out with the approach of the midterm elections in November, which historically tend to go against the political party of the sitting president. That’s a risk to the Democrats’ current slim -- and sometimes nonexistent -- control of Congress. Many market participants have priced in a loss of the party’s legislative majority, according to Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at Nuveen. “Starting with that assumption, which was the case before the invasion, then maybe that means they’re willing to tolerate a little bit more pain and maybe elicit some voter dissatisfaction if they think this is genuinely the right thing to do,” Nick said in an interview. Nonetheless, many of Biden’s top priorities -- repairing the nation’s crumbling infrastructure, alleviating wealth inequality, mitigating global climate change and avoiding a direct conflict with Russia -- in the long run could arguably end up being beneficial to the economy and the American people, and therefore ultimately help the stock market, even if they ruffle feathers for a bit. “You have to keep the bigger picture in mind,” said Scott Bauer, chief executive officer of Prosper Trading Academy in Chicago. “I do not believe they’re concerned about the market going down 10% or 15%. If that happens, it happens, as long as in the long-run, whatever policies they are trying to institute are benefiting Americans.” Meanwhile, in the near term, RBC’s Calvasina says there’s a point at which the market could start to reflect fears about the economy or other factors. And the administration won’t ignore those signs, if and when they arrive. But that’s not the case at the moment. “You can’t sit here and say, ‘The market falls X percent, and then they’ll start to care,’” she said. “It really is a question of what drives the market to any kind of low, what’s the conversation going on in the world or domestically that’s driving the market to a certain level.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Broke Oligarch Says Sanctioned Billionaires Have No Sway Over Putin A Once Radical Idea to Close the Wealth Gap Is Actually Happening For Sale: Trudeau’s Oil Pipeline.

3/21/2022,"After U.S. stocks staged a rebound last week in the wake of the Federal Reserve's much-anticipated monetary policy decision, investors this week will look ahead to a somewhat quieter slate of corporate earnings and economic data releases. One of the most closely watched earnings reports will come after market close on Monday from Nike (NKE). As one of the few companies to report earnings that cover performance for this year, Nike's fiscal third-quarter results will provide an update as to how the multinational corporation performed in the first months of 2022 against a backdrop of an ongoing pandemic and war in Ukraine. Nike shares have dropped by more than 20% for the year-to-date through Friday's close, underperforming the S&P 500's more than 6% decline over the same period. Investors have grown wary of the stock heavily exposed both to international headwinds and to ongoing supply chain issues. Nike joined a number of other U.S.-based companies earlier this month in announcing it would pare back its business in Russia, amid the country's war in Ukraine, saying it would no longer take online orders and would close stores in Russia. ""We expect the focus in 3QF22 to be on: 1) supply chain, including inventory on hand vs. in transit; 2) China, where political backlash and COVID-19 lock downs persist; 3) wholesale distribution, and plans to streamline it further; and 3) demand, which has stayed elevated in NA [North America] and EMEA [Europe, the Middle East, and Africa],"" wrote Telsey Advisory Group analyst Cristina Fernandez in a note Friday. ""Although the near-term for Nike is choppy until inventory flow normalizes, Nike should continue to benefit from enhanced connections with consumers through its membership program, high full-price selling, greater use of data across the organization, and a more integrated strategic wholesale model through the One Nike Marketplace initiative,"" she added. Back in December during Nike's last earnings day and call, the company said it expected to see third-quarter sales grow by a low-single digit percentage, and for full-year sales to grow by mid-single digits. Fernandez said she expects Nike to reiterate this guidance on Monday. Overall, Nike is expected to deliver sales of $10.6 billion for its quarter ending in February, according to Bloomberg consensus data. This would represent growth of 3%, compared to the same period last year. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are expected to reach 72 cents a share, compared to 90 cents per share last year. Sales in Greater China, one of Nike's key markets, are anticipated to rise back above $2 billion after dipping below that threshold in the fiscal second quarter, as COVID-19 cases in China impacted consumer mobility and spending. Still, the country is grappling with a fresh outbreak of the coronavirus, which may present some downside risks to both sales and supplies for Nike's latest and future results.  In December, Nike Chief Financial Officer Matthew Friend said the company was growing ""increasingly confident that supply will normalize heading into fiscal '23."" For many other major companies, however, supply chain concerns have remained top of mind. According to a report from FactSet, 358 S&P 500 companies cited ""supply chain"" during earnings calls for the fourth quarter, with that figure coming in well above the five-year average of 187. ""This is the second-highest number of S&P 500 companies citing 'supply chain' on earnings calls going back to at least 2010 (using current index constituents going back in time),"" FactSet's John Butters said in a note. ""The current record is 362, which occurred in the previous quarter (Q3 2021)."" On the economic data front, this week's consumer sentiment report due out from the University of Michigan on Friday will offer an updated snapshot on the state of the consumer amid soaring inflation and the geopolitical crisis in Ukraine. The institution's revised Surveys of Consumers index is expected to come in unchanged from the preliminary March index at 59.7 — the lowest since 2011. Such a result would solidify the deterioration in consumers' assessments of current and future conditions amid surging prices and turmoil abroad. It would also suggest whether inflation expectations are getting reset and embedded at historically high rates: Earlier this month, consumers said they expected inflation to rise by 5.1% in the next year, marking the highest expected rate since 1981, according to the University of Michigan. And more importantly, the consumer sentiment index will serve as an indicator of whether declining optimism may ultimately lead to a tangible drop in consumer spending, thereby putting the brakes on U.S. economic activity. U.S. consumer spending comprises more than two-thirds of overall economic activity, and already, early signs have suggested rising prices are curbing at least some demand. Retail sales rose just 0.3% in February, Commerce Department data showed last week, to miss Wall Street's expectations. And when stripping out gas and vehicle sales — which were primarily boosted by higher energy prices — retail sales actually declined for the month. ""Consumer sentiment, the Treasury yield curve, economists’ growth expectations and investor sentiment all show signs of fatigue and underscore the possibility of a recession looming on the horizon,"" Lindsey Bell, chief markets and money strategist for Ally, wrote in an email Friday. ""According to the University of Michigan, consumer sentiment has been on the decline since August and in February it recorded its lowest reading since 2011 at 62.8. Readings at 65 or below often coincide with recessions."" ""To be sure, we will need to keep an eye on the consumer as their confidence has been dinged,"" Bell added. ""But I believe given their still strong financial position, and the strength of the job market, it’s possible this could be a temporary blip in confidence. As we can put some of these near-term concerns behind us, the hope is that the second half of 2022 features a steadier global economy and easing inflationary pressures.""

3/21/2022,"This week's more than quarter-point jump in mortgage rates is sending a dire message to homebuyers and owners: Time is running out. Weary buyers already facing the worst affordability conditions are now clambering to snag a low rate before any future increases price them out altogether, according to interviews with real estate pros, while the number of refi candidates coming through the door have dwindled as rates soared past 4% for the first time in almost three years. Mortgage rates have marched up by a full percentage point since the beginning of 2022, hitting 4.16% this week, according to Freddie Mac, and further increases may come as the Federal Reserve is set to raise a key benchmark rate up to six more times this year to combat inflation. “The short answer is it’s painful, I won’t lie. Rates have been escalating every single day for basically the last 45 days,” Scott Sheldon, branch manager at New American Funding in California, told Yahoo Money. “It’s not very fun to be a mortgage originator in this environment. You quote one rate one day and it’s something different a few days later.” As demand increases and inventory levels remain near historic lows, homebuyers aren’t taking any chances with mortgagee rates. Purchase locks increased in February as strong housing demand drove buyers to secure rates despite increases, according Black Knight’s latest Originations Market Monitor report. “I locked many people last week telling them the Fed has said they are going to raise rates ... so let’s not take any chances,” John Stearns, a senior mortgage loan originator with American Fidelity Mortgage in Wisconsin, told Yahoo Money. First-time homebuyers face challenging housing conditions. Going into 2022, the number of homes for sale was already near record lows. High demand coupled with rising home prices has also been a financial blow, as bidding wars and all-cash offers saturate an ultra competitive market. “Multiple borrowers have been left out of the home-buying market over the past year, even when well qualified, due to multiple bids and skyrocketing prices,” said Jeffrey Ruben, president of WSFS mortgage. “The rise of inflation to levels we haven’t seen in four decades coupled with the unprecedented rise in home prices in 2021 is having impacts on home affordability for many people.” Now add in rising mortgage rates. “What I’m telling clients now is if you're happy with the rate and price ... and what you can afford, lock the rate,"" Sheldon said. ""Don’t play the rate-float game."" Rising rates have also shut off refinance incentives. Refi activity has dropped more than 85% from December 2020 and is now at its lowest level in the post-Great Recession era — outside of 2018 — when rates rose above 4.5%, according to mortgage technology and data provider Black Knight. “The refinancing chances may be over,” Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors, told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""Because rates will only go higher from this point."" At 4.16%, only 2.6 million high-quality candidates now could shave at least three-quarters of a point off their mortgage by refinancing, saving $302 per month. That’s three-quarters less than the 11 million at the beginning of the year who could save that much, according to figures Black Knight provided Yahoo Money. ""The continued sharp rise in 30-year rates will further constrain refinance activity and speed the transition to an equity-centric market with a focus on cash-out lending,” Andy Walden, Black Knight's vice president of enterprise research and strategy, told Yahoo Money. The rise in mortgage rates isn't over as the Fed plans future hikes of its short-term benchmark rate, Yun said, though those anticipated increases have largely been baked in. ""Most of the increases have already occurred in anticipation of the Fed making several moves this year, Yun said, noting that the relationship between the Fed rate and the 30-year mortgage rate is not one to one with the home loan rate increasing more modestly after the central bank's moves. ""From this point onward I would say that mortgage rates might hit 4.5% toward the year end."" Gabriella is a personal finance reporter at Yahoo Money. Follow her on Twitter @__gabriellacruz.

3/21/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Momentum toward higher yields has stalled in the world’s biggest bond market, underscoring how rapidly traders priced in the hawkish message delivered by the Federal Reserve. Most Read from Bloomberg Ukraine Update: Zelenskiy Says Some Opposition Parties Suspended Ukraine Update: Biden to Hold Call With European, U.K. Leaders Russia Uses Hypersonic Weapons as War Enters Bloodier Phase Where Mornings Would Get Darker Under Permanent Daylight Savings Time Putin Set a Trap for Ukraine and Walked Right Into It The Treasury market selloff ended most dramatically in two-year notes, where yields peaked just below 2%, a level last seen in May 2019. Two-year yields have risen by nearly 50 basis points over the past two weeks and more than doubled from where they began the year -- a much bigger move than has preceded previous Fed tightening cycles. More broadly, the subsequent pullback in yields reflects the view that the six additional rate increases the Fed has signaled for this year -- combined with elevated inflation -- will dent the economy. Longer-dated yields rose less than the two-year’s and declined more from their peaks. In several cases they wound up lower than shorter-dated yields, a harbinger of recession. The eurodollar futures curve, a proxy for the direction of the Fed’s policy rate, peaks in September 2023 and declines from there, an implicit expectation that the Fed will be cutting rates by then to jump start growth. “A lot is already priced in as far as hikes for this year and early next year,” said Yvette Klevan, portfolio manager in the global fixed-income team at Lazard Asset Management, which oversees about $240 billion in assets. “I’m not completely convinced that all of this will be realized,” with Russia’s war on Ukraine and the pandemic complicating the outlook. The Fed’s aim is to bring inflation down without causing a recession. Its preferred inflation gauge in January was more than triple the central banks’ long-run target rate of 2%, and other measures of inflation such as the Consumer Price Index are higher still. Chair Jerome Powell in his post-meeting news conference this week said the probability of a recession in the next year “is not particularly elevated,” judging by spending and labor market conditions, and that the economy “is very strong and well positioned to withstand tighter monetary policy.” Investors have doubts. “We are less convinced on the underlying strength in both demand and labor markets, so remain skeptical that they follow through with their full hiking program,” said Steven Englander, global head of G-10 FX research at Standard Chartered Bank. “The Fed may use the next few meetings to front-load hikes while such moves are popular politically and with the public.” The quarterly forecasts for their policy rate that Fed officials released this week had medians of 1.875% at year-end and 2.75% at the end of 2023, corresponding to six additional quarter-point increases this year and at least two more next year. The rate, for which the central bank sets a band, was increased to 0.25%-0.50% from 0%-0.25%. However the dispersion of forecasts was extremely wide by historical standards, ranging from 1.375%-3.125% for this year and 2.125%-3.625% for next year. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who dissented from the decision in favor of a half-point increase, on Friday identified himself as the high forecaster for this year. Shortly afterward, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said the war in Ukraine was the reason he didn’t push for a half-point increase at the meeting. Policy makers, who refrain from making public comments during the week or so leading up to their meetings, will be out in force again next week. The Fed “can’t be too zealous and tighten the screws too tight for the economy,” said Kevin Flanagan, head of fixed income strategy at Wisdom Tree Investments. With a half-point rate hike, the Treasury curve between two- and 10-years, which narrowed to 18 basis points last week, would advance more quickly toward its first inversion since August 2019. At the end of February, the only inverted segment of the Treasury curve was between 20- and 30-year bonds. By the end of this week, the curve was inverted between seven and 10 years and between three and five years. The outlook is further complicated by the Fed’s plan to shrink its balance sheet by ceasing to roll over all of the maturing Treasury securities in its portfolio as they mature. The portfolio more than doubled in size to more than $8 trillion over the past two years as the Fed bought Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to further stimulate the economy, termed quantitative easing, after cutting the policy rate as much as possible. The plan is to stop replacing a fixed dollar amount of its maturing Treasury holdings each month. This was done from 2017 to 2019, using runoff caps that increased over time. The next iteration of quantitative tightening could being as soon as the Fed’s next policy meeting in May, “much sooner in the cycle than last time” and “faster than the last time,” Powell said after the March 15-16 meeting. Balance-sheet shrinkage “might be the equivalent of another rate increase,” he said. “At some point in this cycle things are going be very uncomfortable when we see the Fed still tightening while the economy is already slowing,” said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at Deutsche Bank AG.

3/21/2022,"The three biggest international oilfield services firms remain in Russia, not following nearly all Western oil majors that have said in recent weeks they would quit their Russian joint ventures and projects and would quit trading Russian oil. While BP, Shell, and ExxonMobil raced to announce they are withdrawing from all their operations and stakes in companies and joint ventures in Russia following Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, Schlumberger, Halliburton, and Baker Hughes have not announced such moves, the Financial Times reports. The three oilfield services firms, the world’s largest, did not respond to FT’s requests for comment on their Russian business. Schlumberger, Halliburton, and Baker Hughes are partners with the biggest Russian oil and gas firms, including state-controlled Rosneft and Gazprom Neft. The current sanctions against Russia ban new investments of U.S. and EU companies in Russia’s energy, but they do not restrict the existing operations, according to FT. “It’s much easier for them to operate under the radar because they are not directly exploiting or exporting oil and natural resources,” Audun Martinsen, head of energy services research at Rystad Energy, told FT, commenting on the oilfield services firms’ business in Russia. For Schlumberger, the world’s largest oilfield services firm, Russia currently represents approximately 5 percent of its global revenue, chief executive officer Olivier Le Peuch said last week in an update on the outlook for the quarter ending March 31, 2022. “Consequently, based on what we see today, and taking into account that Russia currently only represents approximately 5% of our global revenue, we continue to believe that increased activity and pricing will drive simultaneous double-digit growth—both internationally and in North America—that will lead our overall 2022 revenue growth to reach the mid-teens,” Le Peuch said about Schlumberger’s expected performance this year. Early this month, after Russia invaded Ukraine, protesters gathered in front of Schlumberger’s offices in Sugar Land in Houston to demand that the world’s biggest oilfield services firm stop doing business in Russia, the Houston Chronicle reported.

3/21/2022,"Since the Wyckoff spring pattern on 24 February 2022 that marked the temporary bottom in S&P 500, excessive supply has capped the upside of the rally. On 16 March 2022 there were a number of subtle bullish tell-tale signs showed up, which confirmed the short covering rally in S&P 500. This is similar to a Wyckoff change of character in the short-term as illustrated in the video for gold and crude oil, but to the upside in S&P 500. The down swings (highlighted in blue) since 10 February 2022 were getting shorter in terms of the magnitude, which was a sign of exhaustion of selling. The high consistent of the supply as shown in the volume pane (annotated in orange) accompanied the down swings suggested supply absorption as downward results were not manifested. This was the first clue that the bargain hunters showed up, which created the bullish condition for a rally. Refer to the chart below: On 16 Mar 2022 (as annotated in green arrow), S&P 500 broke out from the down trend line, which acted as a strong resistance this year. Although there was a breakout on 9 February 2022, it was negated in the next bar as a failure. This was the second bullish reversal pattern in S&P 500. This bar also overcame the last down commitment bar on 11 March 2022 and closed above its high as the third bullish pattern. This was significant because it signified a potential bullish reversal from there on. Majority of the short-sellers exited their positions because of the violation of this significant level hence propelling the rally further. This was reflected on the low volume rally on 17-18 March 2022, which was an ease-of-movement in the price action. These 3 bullish patterns painted a bullish picture ahead for S&P 500. On 18 March 20, 2022, S&P 500 broke above the axis line where the previous support-turned-resistance, suggested a bullish continuation to test the resistance zone between 4480-4600. This zone is a strong resistance area where the previous breakdown and rejection happened. Short-sellers are naturally attracted to this zone to initiate short positions. Based on the Wyckoff phase analysis, S&P 500 is likely in phase B after a secondary test as a spring type action followed by two tests with supply absorption characteristics. It is on its way up to test the resistance zone as define by the automatic rally (AR). Refer to the chart below: As the long-term trend is still down, the short-term bullishness is expected to be met by the dominating supply after a test of the resistance zone (as annotated in the green path). Detail analysis will be conducted in the Wyckoff trading method live session to interpret the supply and demand in conjunction with the price action in order to derive the directional bias as shown in the video. It is crucial to pay attention to how the price interacts with the key resistance zone between 4480-4600. The strong rally in the past week was great for bullish trade setup for swing trading. The bullish market sentiment is also reflected in my stock screener where the bullish setup outnumbers the bearish setup (274 vs 14). Refer to the screenshot below: The focus of the stock selection is still on those outperforming stocks instead of the oversold stocks (like a lot of the technology / growth stocks). Majority of the soft and hard commodity stocks experience a healthy pullback / consolidation. Bullish continuation is expected to carry on in this group.

The pause comes after Shenzhen-based Evergrande said in January that it aimed to present a preliminary restructuring proposal in the next six months. The firm has been at the center of a cash crisis among Chinese property developers following Beijing’s crackdown. Investors are watching for signs of further asset sales as the group faces pressure from bondholders and offshore creditors in what’s likely to become one of China’s largest restructurings. The company has more than $300 billion in liabilities and is under pressure to pay suppliers and migrant workers and complete millions of unfinished homes. On Sunday, local media reported that Evergrande’s onshore unit will sell its 30% stake in a Nanjing property company to Avic Trust Co. for an undisclosed sum. The company’s onshore unit separately said it received bondholders’ approval to delay coupon payments on its four billion yuan note, meaning the delay won’t trigger a default on the bond.

3/21/2022,"In the week ending 17th March, mortgage rates surged to 4% levels for the first time since 2019. 30-year fixed rates surged by 31 basis points to 4.16%. 30-year fixed rates had risen by 9 basis points in the week prior. Year-on-year, 30-year fixed rates were up by 107 basis points. 30-year fixed rates were still down by 78 basis points since November 2018’s last peak of 4.94%. In the first half of the week, wholesale inflation and retail sales were the key stats. The numbers were dollar negative. The core producer price index increased by 0.2% in February, softer than a 1.0% rise in January. More significantly, retail sales were also disappointing. Core retail sales rose by just 0.2%, with retail sales up 0.3% in February. Both had seen marked increases in the month prior. While the stats disappointed, a FED rate hike and hawkish interest rate projections drove mortgage rates back to 4%. Hopes of a ceasefire in Ukraine and Beijing economic stimulus supported demand for riskier assets, delivering further upside for U.S Treasury yields. The weekly average rates for new mortgages, as of 17th March, were quoted by Freddie Mac to be: 30-year fixed rates surged by 31 basis points to 4.16% in the week. This time last year, rates had stood at 3.09%. The average fee remained unchanged at 0.8 points. 15-year fixed rates jumped by 30 basis points to 3.39% in the week. Rates were up by 99 basis points from 2.40% a year ago. The average fee remained unchanged at 0.8 points. 5-year fixed rates rose by 22 basis points to 3.19%. Rates were up by 40 basis points from 2.79% a year ago. The average fee fell from 0.3 points to 0.2 points. According to Freddie Mac, Mortgage rates exceeded 4% for the first time since May 2019. The FED raising short-term rates and projecting further increases point to further increases in mortgage rates. While demand for homes has moderated, low inventories keep the housing sector competitive, suggesting further increases in house prices. For the week ending 11th March, the rates were: Average interest rates for 30-year fixed with conforming loan balances rose from 4.09% to 4.27%. Points increased from 0.44 to 0.54 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Average 30-year fixed mortgage rates backed by FHA increased from 4.12% to 4.23%. Points fell from 0.73 to 0.62 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Average 30-year rates for jumbo loan balances increased from 3.79% to 4.02%. Points fell from 0.39 to 0.37 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Weekly figures released by the Mortgage Bankers Association showed that the Market Composite Index, a measure of mortgage loan application volume, decreased by 1.2% in the week ending 11th March. The index had increased 8.5% in the previous week. The Refinance Index declined 3% and was 49% lower than the same week a year ago. In the week prior, the index increased by 9%. The refinance share of mortgage activity decreased from 49.5% to 48.4%. In the previous week, the share fell from 49.9% to 49.5%. According to the MBA, Mortgage rates continue to be volatile due to the significant uncertainty regarding FED policy and the war in Ukraine. Investors are considering the impacts of rapidly increasing inflation in the U.S and the world against the possible slowdown in growth due to supply-chain disruption. 30-year fixed mortgage rate increased to 4.27%, the highest since May 2019. It’s a particularly quiet start to the week, with no major U.S stats for the markets to consider. While there are no stats, FED Chair Powell is scheduled to speak on Monday and Wednesday.

3/21/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes are coming off their best weeks since November 2020 even after a rough start to the year. But the question now for investors is whether the gains will stick. Most Read from Bloomberg Ukraine Update: Mariupol Refuses Russia Ultimatum; Kyiv Mall Hit Ukraine Update: Zelenskiy Says Some Opposition Parties Suspended Russia Uses Hypersonic Weapons as War Enters Bloodier Phase Hong Kong Signals Covid Shift by Cutting Flight Bans, Quarantine Where Mornings Would Get Darker Under Permanent Daylight Savings Time It’s a unique moment for the U.S. stock market, which is staring down a distinct set of circumstances -- from geopolitical risks to rising interest rates -- that when combined have historically led to a bear markets. First, the Federal Reserve is starting to raise interest rates, with the first quarter-point hike coming last Wednesday and many more on the way. Then there’s Russia’s war with Ukraine, which is creating a humanitarian crisis in Europe and destabilizing financial markets around the world. Meanwhile, oil prices are soaring past $100 a barrel and threatening to further stoke inflation, which is already at a 40-year high. And parts of the Treasury yield curves are inverting. Here’s a look at what history says about the U.S. stock market when these factors collide: History of Bear Markets The S&P 500 bull market will turn two on Wednesday after the index staged a stunning rebound from the Covid-induced economic downturn after it bottomed on March 23, 2020, wiping out about 34% of its value. Since then, the index has doubled in the face of the worst global pandemic in a century. However, since World War II the combination of a Fed rate-tightening cycle, geopolitical tension, high inflation and a flattening yield curve have triggered a bear market, or a 20% decline from the index’s peak, according to investment-research firm CFRA. Unique Cross-Currents It’s rare for the Fed to raise rates at a time when markets are under pressure and geopolitical tensions are bubbling. In fact, the last two times the S&P 500 entered a correction or bear market while the Fed was in a tightening cycle occurred during the Hungarian uprising and Suez Canal crisis of 1956 and the Tet Offensive in 1968, a pivotal moment in the Vietnam War in which the North launched a coordinated attack on the South and inflicted severe casualties. Sector Clues How particular industries perform in the near term could provide investors with more clues on the trajectory of the market. Late-cycle cyclical sectors like materials and industrials, along with defensive-natured groups like consumer staples and health care tend to be strong six months ahead of a recession. But rate-sensitive stocks like financials and real estate, as well as growth-oriented companies in technology, consumer discretionary and communication-services sectors, historically lag. For the S&P 500 to sink into a bear market, cyclical value and defensive sectors will likely need to drop much further from current levels, according to Ned David Research. Moderating Returns To be sure, most economists don’t anticipate that the U.S. economy will fall into recession in 2022, due to a strong labor market, robust consumer spending and better-than-expected corporate profits. Another part of the yield curve inverted Friday, with yields on three-year Treasuries rising above five-year Treasuries for the first time since March 2020. The spread between two-year and 10-year yields, which has historically been a gauge for recession, has also narrowed. But the 10-year yield compared to three-month Treasury bills, which has similarly predicted downturns, is actually steepening.

However, stocks may still have room to run. Since 1957, the average bull market in the S&P 500 has lasted 5.8 years, according to Truist Advisory services. The current bull market is just two years old.

3/21/2022,"The final public testnet called ‘Kiln’ has put ‘the merge’ through its paces over the past few days. This is a testbed for developers and node operators to simulate the merger of the two Ethereum chains, ETH 1.0 and the Beacon Chain proof-of-stake blockchain. Ethereum is currently operating on a proof-of-work blockchain that requires power and resource-hungry mining hardware similar to Bitcoin (BTC). Governments and environmentalists have targeted this in their latest attempts to crack down on crypto, which is why a switch to proof-of-stake couldn’t come at a better time for Ethereum. Instead of using energy-consuming computers to crunch numbers to validate blocks, ETH holders stake their tokens in a smart contract to validate new blocks on the chain. This drops the network’s power demands significantly, keeping the regulators at bay. Over the weekend, crypto investor and industry observer Bob Loukas commented on the narrative and increased talk about ‘the merge’ that developers have said may happen in June. With inflation at record levels and interest rates at rock bottom, earning a yield on a deflationary asset – which Ethereum will become after the merge – has become a desirable investment for many. According to on-chain data from Glassnode, around 320,000 ETH has left exchanges since the start of the Kiln testnet, and most of this has gone into staking. Other industry observers took a closer look at the current state of Ethereum staking.  According to the Beacon Chain explorer, there is currently 10.2 million ETH staked on the consensus layer chain. At current prices, this is worth a whopping $29 billion, which would rank it as the 8th largest cryptocurrency if that was its market capitalization. Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin over the past week, gaining 12.7% compared to BTC’s 7.8%. Ethereum prices hit a weekend high of $2,974 on Sunday but could not break resistance at the $3,000 level. As a result, the asset has fallen back during the Monday morning Asian trading session to change hands at $2,839 at the time of writing.

3/21/2022,"By Noah Browning LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped more than $3 on Monday, with Brent crude climbing above $111 a barrel, as European Union nations considered joining the United States in a Russian oil embargo and after a weekend attack on Saudi oil facilities. Brent crude futures were up $3.40, or 3.2%, at $111.33 a barrel by 0958 GMT, adding to a 1.2% rise last Friday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose $3.65, or 3.5%, to $108.35, extending a 1.7% jump last Friday. Prices moved higher ahead of talks this week between European Union governments and U.S. President Joe Biden in a series of summits that aim to harden the West's response to Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. EU governments will consider whether to impose an oil embargo on Russia. Early on Monday Ukraine's deputy prime minister, Iryna Vershchuk, said there was no chance the country's forces would surrender in the besieged eastern port city of Mariupol. With little sign of the conflict easing, the focus returned to whether the market would be able to replace Russian barrels hit by sanctions. ""A Houthi attack on a Saudi energy terminal, warnings of a structural shortfall in production from OPEC and a potential European Union oil embargo on Russia have seen oil prices jump in Asia,"" OANDA senior analyst Jeffrey Halley said in a note. ""Even if the Ukraine war ends tomorrow, the world will face a structural energy deficit thanks to Russian sanctions."" Over the weekend, attacks by Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group caused a temporary drop in output at a Saudi Aramco refinery joint venture in Yanbu, feeding concern in a jittery oil products market, where Russia is a key supplier and global inventories are at multi-year lows. The latest report from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies including Russia, together known as OPEC+, showed some producers are still falling short of their agreed supply quotas.

3/21/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Wells Fargo & Co. was sued for discriminating against Black homeowners by relying on a modernized version of “redlining” that allegedly denied them lower interest rates through refinancing and forced them to pay more for loans. Most Read from Bloomberg Ukraine Update: Mariupol Refuses to Surrender on Russia Deadline Ukraine Update: Zelenskiy Says Some Opposition Parties Suspended Russia Uses Hypersonic Weapons as War Enters Bloodier Phase Where Mornings Would Get Darker Under Permanent Daylight Savings Time Putin Set a Trap for Ukraine and Walked Right Into It The lawsuit, filed Friday in federal court in San Francisco as a proposed class action, argues that the practices in many cases pushed Black homeowners into foreclosure. Historically, redlining referred to the Federal Housing Administration’s refusal to insure mortgages in and near Black neighborhoods, and agreements that blocked or restricted the sales of homes to Black Americans. “Federal data shows that over the last several years thousands of Black homeowners have been unable to maintain the dream of home ownership because of Wells Fargo’s ongoing and discriminatory modern day ‘redlining’ practices,” according to the complaint. Wells Fargo had no immediate comment on the suit. The complaint cites previous reporting by Bloomberg News showing that Wells Fargo rejected a disproportionate number of Black homeowners’ refinancing applications in 2020 when the pandemic set off a rush to lock in lower rates. Read More: Wells Fargo Rejected Half Its Black Applicants in Mortgage Refinancing Boom Following the news report, U.S. Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, and other Democratic senators this week called for regulators to investigate Wells Fargo’s treatment of Black homeowners seeking to refinance mortgages during the pandemic. Citing data from 8 million refinancing applications from 2020, the lawsuit says Wells Fargo was more likely to approve refinancing applications from White borrowers earning between $0 and $63,000 annually than it was for Black applicants earning between $120,000 and $168,000 annually. “Black applicants are further subjected to delays, feigned mistakes, and other obstacles, leading many Black Americans to withdraw their requests for refinancing, and leading others to wait indefinitely while Wells Fargo refuses to act upon their applications,” according to the complaint. The suit alleges violations of federal fair credit and housing laws, U.S. and California civil rights statutes, as well as California’s unfair competition law. The case is Braxton v. Wells Fargo, 22-cv-1748, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).

3/21/2022,"(Adds details, quote) March 21 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc has struck an $11.6 billion deal to buy Alleghany Corp , the owner of reinsurer TransRe, just weeks after the 91-year-old billionaire bemoaned the lack of good investment opportunities. Alleghany adds to Berkshire's already large insurance portfolio, which includes Geico auto insurance, General Re reinsurance and a unit that insures against major and unusual risks. Founded in 1929 by railroad entrepreneurs Oris and Mantis Van Sweringen, New York-based Alleghany operates mainly in property and casualty reinsurance and insurance through subsidiaries and investments. Alleghany was transformed from a largely railroad holding company into an insurance and investment firm by Fred Morgan Kirby II. The company's board is currently led by Jefferson Kirby. ""Berkshire will be the perfect permanent home for Alleghany, a company that I have closely observed for 60 years,"" Berkshire Hathaway's Chairman and Chief Executive Warren Buffett said in a statement on Monday. ""Throughout 85 years the Kirby family has created a business that has many similarities to Berkshire Hathaway,"" Buffett said. Buffett had pledged in February to keep more than $30 billion of cash on hand, leaving plenty available for the right acquisition. Alleghany's insurance holdings also include RSUI Group, an underwriter of wholesale specialty insurance, and CapSpecialty, a specialty insurance company. Berkshire Hathaway offered $848.02 for each share of Alleghany, a premium of more than 25% to the company's closing price on Friday. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2022 and Alleghany will operate as an independent unit of Berkshire Hathaway after closing. Goldman Sachs advised Alleghany on the deal.

3/21/2022,"A nascent Nuro challenger from China has its sight set on the delivery market in the US and has just raised some seed funding to advance its ambitions. Whale Dynamic, a Shenzhen-based autonomous delivery startup founded by Baidu veteran David Chang, says it has closed a seed round of about $2.5 million. Qianchuang Capital, a Beijing-based investment firm managed by veterans from China's leading financial institutions, led the round, with participation from Shangbang Huizhong, a Chinese fund backed by real estate developers. Founded in 2018, Whale Dynamic is developing Nuro-like driverless delivery vans that are meant to do away with the steering wheel and driver's seat. And like Nuro, whose delivery bots are made by BYD, it contracts a Chinese manufacturer to produce its self-driving vehicles, the name of which cannot be revealed yet as the deal has not been finalized. Whale Dynamic's slight edge over Nuro lies in costs, surmises Chang, who worked as a product manager in Baidu's intelligent driving group. Nuro assembles parts in the US while the complete production of Whale Dynamic's vehicles, from manufacturing to assembling, happens in China, which gives it a price advantage over its American counterpart. Its vehicles are priced at around $20,000 each. The latest financial injection will enable Whale Dynamic to expand its current team of 30 employees and explore product use cases in China and the US. Led by director of engineering Qi Wei who hailed from Huawei, the company aims to have its first prototype car testing in some Chinese cities in May. In China, Whale Dynamic faces competition from retail tech giants like Meituan and JD.com, which started testing their own goods-only delivery vehicles last year. Chang believes that his company's technology, which takes the slower and more costly route of conducting R&D and testing on passenger cars rather than building the boxes-on-wheels directly, can better stand the test of time. Whale Dynamic's testing fleet using passenger cars Chang eventually wants to base his firm in the US and target express delivery services and supermarkets there. ""You can test things much more quickly at lower costs in China,"" Chang explains why he started out in China. As regulators from China and the US increase scrutiny over tech companies for potential national security risks, businesses that straddle the two countries will have to heed greater regulations or pick sides. TuSimple, a California-based autonomous trucking company backed by an affiliate of Chinese social media giant Sina, is looking to sell its China unit, Reuters reported. Most of TuSimple's vehicles operate in the US with a smaller fleet running in China. But US regulators have voiced concerns over the firm's Chinese background and its China office's access to data, which reportedly led to TuSimple's decision to offload its China unit. Security compliance is a priority at Whale Dynamic, says Chang. When it enters the US market, the startup will opt for US cloud services like AWS and Google Cloud; its China team will take care of hardware development only. The company's key suppliers are also American -- Ouster for lidar (and Israel-based Innoviz which has offices in the US), and Nvidia and Intel for chips. Unlike Nuro, which operates its own fleets, Whale Dynamic plans to only offer ready-to-use vehicles and software-as-a-service, leaving the operational part to its clients, which should limit the amount of sensitive data the startup can glean.

They include firms in the energy, refining, financial services and manufacturing sectors, the official said. The U.S. has led a global push to sanction Russia as a response to its invasion, upending supply chains, commodities markets and exacerbating inflationary pressures. The meeting comes as the White House has publicly called on energy suppliers to step up production after a jump in prices, while criticizing executives who have said they are prioritizing investor returns over additional output. Last week, Biden also criticized gas companies for maintaining high prices at the pump even as oil receded from recent highs. “Oil and gas companies shouldn’t pad their profits at the expense of hardworking Americans,” Biden said.

On Thursday, core durable goods, private sector PMIs, and jobless claims will be key. Expect the services PMI and jobless claims to draw the greatest interest. Following last week’s projections and rate hike, FOMC member chatter will also need monitoring. On the monetary policy front, FED Chair Powell is scheduled to speak on Monday and Wednesday In the week ending 18th March, the Dollar Spot Index fell by 0.90% to 98.233. Prelim private sector PMIs for France, Germany, and the Eurozone will be in focus on Thursday. Expect Germany and the Eurozone’s PMIs to be key. On Friday, Germany’s IFO Business Climate Index figures will also provide direction. ECB President Lagarde’s speeches on Monday and Tuesday and the ECB Economic Bulletin on Thursday will also draw plenty of interest. For the week, the EUR rallied by 1.27% to $1.1051. It’s a busy week ahead. Mid-week, inflation figures for February will draw interest ahead of private sector PMIs on Thursday. Expect the inflation and services PMI to be the key stats. At the end of the week, retail sales figures will also provide direction, however. On the monetary policy front, BoE Gov. Bailey is scheduled to speak ahead of the Autumn budget on Wednesday. The Pound rose by 1.08% to end the week at $1.3178. Economic data is limited to RMPI numbers for February. We don’t expect too much influence from the figures, however.

There are no material stats to provide the Aussie Dollar with direction. The lack of stats will leave the Aussie Dollar in the hands of market risk sentiment in the week. The Aussie Dollar jumped by 1.67% to $0.7415. Trade data will be in focus at the start of the week, with consumer confidence figures mid-week. Both sets of numbers will provide the Kiwi Dollar with direction in the first half of the week. The Kiwi Dollar ended the week up 1.45% to $0.6908. In a shortened week, private sector PMI and Tokyo inflation figures for March are the only stats to consider.

3/21/2022,"General Motors is acquiring SoftBank's stake in Cruise and pouring even more money into the self-driving unit it purchased in 2016. The auto giant has announced that it's buying out SoftBank Vision Fund 1's equity ownership into the company that's worth $2.1 billion. In addition, it has committed to investing an extra $1.35 billion in Cruise to replace the funding SoftBank promised in February after the self-driving car company started offering robotaxi rides in San Francisco. The automaker didn't say why it's buying SoftBank's equity ownership, but GM chief executive Mary Barra said: ""Our increased investment position not only simplifies Cruise's shareholder structure, but also provides GM and Cruise maximum flexibility to pursue the most value-accretive path to commercializing and unlocking the full potential of AV technology."" SoftBank, meanwhile, has recently struggled with debt and the plummeting value of its properties. It may no longer be interested in an investment that won't field returns anytime soon. In February, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said the company would sell ""a good chunk of assets"" after ARM's multi-billion sale to NVIDIA fell through.

A GM spokesperson told the publication that the automaker will ""consider all opportunities to create value for [its] shareholders"" and that it ""has not ruled out a future IPO of Cruise.""

3/21/2022,"Michael Gove attacks ‘cartel’ of big property developers FTSE 100 opens higher, as oil prices heat up Dow Jones closed at 34,754.9, S&P 500 at 4,463.1 Lucy Burton: Crackdown on City ‘boys’ nights’ is also good for men Sign up here for our daily business briefing newsletter Moscow’s biggest airport has put around 7,000 employees on furlough and slashed their pay in a sign that Russia is preparing for a prolonged period of international isolation. Sheremetyevo Airport, previously the country’s busiest international transport hub, furloughed 40pc of its staff last week and cut their pay by a third, according to local media reports. Bosses told staff the decision was ""out of the control of the employer"" and connected to the ""critical decrease in passenger traffic"" triggered by Western sanctions. It comes after Western countries imposed a slew of harsh sanctions against the Kremlin following its invasion of Ukraine, including closing their airspace to Russian-owned and Russian-registered aircraft. This has resulted in Russia only having permission to operate direct flights to a handful of countries, such as Belarus, Serbia and the United Arab Emirates. A ban on buying Russian oil in Britain and the US will have little impact on Moscow because they only buy small amounts anyway, Russian state media has claimed. Interfax quoted Russian deputy prime minister Alexander Novak Novak as saying his country is in the process of resolving logistical issues linked to its oil shipments abroad and that the country's oil and gas production was continuing as usual despite sanctions. But his comments come as EU countries - which buy more than half of Russia's oil exports - are looking again at a possible oil embargo. The foreign ministers of Lithuania and Ireland are among those pushing such a move, at the start of a week of intense diplomacy. The Polish government wants to amend the constitution so that it can raise defence spending, a government spokesman said on Monday. The Defence of the Fatherland Act adopted this month says that Poland's defence spending will increase to 3pc of GDP, which could result in exceeding budgetary thresholds enshrined in the constitution. ""The Polish army must be immediately equipped to the highest standards, therefore one of the proposed changes to the constitution will be the exclusion of expenditure on the army and armaments from the public debt threshold,"" a government spokesman said. Changes to the constitution require a two-thirds majority in the lower house of parliament and an absolute majority in the opposition-dominated Senate, so the government's proposals need to be supported by other political parties. A top German minister has urged Gulf states not to ""profiteer"" from Western sanctions on Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. Speaking on a visit to the United Arab Emirates, economy minister Robert Habeck said: ""I'm not asking that they join the sanctions....but I ask not to be a profiteer of European and US sanctions."" He is visiting the region to discuss long-term energy supplies as Berlin scrambles to wean itself off Russian gas. Earlier, on Sunday, Habeck announced a new partnership with Qatar on supplies of liquefied natural gas. In Abu Dhabi, he said German firms would sign five memoranda of understanding concerning hydrogen research and development. Switzerland must freeze the accounts of Russian oligarchs in the country and confiscate their assets, the Polish prime minister said on Monday. Mateusz Morawiecki was speaking as he welcomed Swiss president Ignazio Cassis to Warsaw. ""They must be frozen, the assets of Russian oligarchs in Switzerland must be confiscated and I called on the president to see to it that Switzerland approaches this topic decisively,"" Morawiecki told a news conference. Cassis said Switzerland had already adopted European Union sanctions against hundreds of people, including many oligarchs. ""They cannot dispose of their assets,"" he said. In a bid to force a Russian military withdrawal from Ukraine, Western countries have imposed numerous sanctions, including freezing the Russian central bank's assets. Rishi Sunak’s plans to ease pain at petrol pumps by cutting fuel duty is set to cost £2.5bn - but would only represent a fraction of the possible £75bn war chest available to the Chancellor as tax revenues soar. The Treasury is said to be mulling a 5p per litre reduction in fuel duty after prices at the pump soared to their highest level on record last week. Fuel duty has been frozen for over a decade at 57.95p per litre but the proposed cut would cost the Chancellor around £2.5bn, my colleague Tom Rees reports. Mr Sunak is facing mounting pressure to splash out on measures to help shield households from the fastest rise in living costs for 30 years. A Spanish truck-driver strike going on for the last week is now delaying deliveries by Inditex, the world’s largest clothing retailer. Inditex is warning clients that buy products on its Zara website that shipments could suffer delays due to the strike. The strike over fuel prices has been disrupting supply chains in the country. Last week, a dairy industry trade group said that the protests had interrupted the supply of raw materials and distribution to retail chains. German carmaker Volkswagen will also halt production Monday at its plant in the northern Spanish region of Navarra as it lacks some of the components needed due to the strike, Europa Press reported Friday. The Kremlin on Monday said Europe would be hit hard in the event of an embargo on Russian oil but would not affect the United States. Some European Union foreign ministers are pushing for an oil embargo as part of further sanctions against Russia, in an effort to punish Moscow over events in Ukraine. But Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin's spokesman, pictured above, told reporters the question of any oil embargo was a very complex topic. Meanwhile, as European leaders prepared for a summit with US President Joe Biden on Thursday, Dutch premier Mark Rutte stressed the EU could not cut itself off overnight. ""Too many refineries in the eastern and western part of Europe still completely depend on Russian oil and with gas it's even worse"", he said after a meeting with Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda in Vilnius. Our lead story in today's paper, by reporter Ben Gartside, reports how Michael Gove has been further distancing himself from the ""cartel"" of British housing developers. In comments likely to add to the Levelling Up Secretary's feud with builders, he told Tory activists: I’m not a poster boy [for developers]…I’m not particularly popular with developers at the moment because of some of the steps we’ve taken in respect of building safety and some of the other changes we want to make as well. There are 101 changes we want to make, that we’ve essentially got a cartel of volume housebuilders who operate in a particular way, and there are all sorts of unhappy consequences. As I mentioned, all of their incentives are essentially to swallow up virgin greenfields, rather than to think hard about regeneration. Read the full story here.  The FTSE 100 rose on Monday as surging oil prices boosted shares of energy majors, although concerns about inflation and a handful of brokerage downgrades checked overall market gains. The commodity-heavy index advanced 0.5pc, hitting its highest level in more than two weeks. Both Shell and BP gained about 2.5pc, tracking a jump of more than $3 in Brent crude prices after news that European Union governments will consider whether to impose an oil embargo on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Miners such as Glencore and Anglo American also edged higher as London aluminium prices leaped nearly 5pc after Australia banned exports of alumina and aluminium ores to Russia. Higher commodity prices this year have driven up mining and energy stocks, which have a big weight on the FTSE 100, helping the index outperform its peers. ""This resilient performance has helped to put the UK back on the map for overseas investors looking to diversify their holdings,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. For decades, male City traders thought boozing and banter would win them a badge of honour. But the finance sector is now changing, my colleague Lucy Burton argues in a comment piece today: It is not just women who suffer from loutish behaviour which normalises sexism and turns overt abuse into a joke. Men who want to work in sectors, such as finance and insurance, should not have to feel that toxic masculinity and mindless nights’ out is their fast-track ticket to getting ahead. There is more than one way to be a man. The hard-drinking version typically associated with lad culture isn’t the majority. Even the rugby captain who once poured vomit over his own head at university may now be ready to move on. House prices have hit a fresh record high, jumping by nearly £6,000 in a single month amid a rush to buy ahead of rising mortgage costs, my colleague Melissa Lawford writes for Telegraph Money. The average British home now costs £354,564, according to property website Rightmove, marking the first time asking prices have risen above £350,000. It came as homeowners increased their price tags by 1.7pc to an average of £5,760 in March, the largest monthly rise during spring since 2004. Sellers are taking advantage of an extreme shortage of homes up for sale, as well as buyers rushing to purchase before rising interest rates bring an end to the era of cheap debt. The Bank of England last week made its third consecutive increase to the Bank Rate since December, to 0.75pc. Read the rest here. Enel, Italy’s largest utility, will exit from its Russia operations in a matter of months, chief executive Francesco Starace said on Monday. “We are on the process of selling thermal generation, this is a process we had time ago,” Starace told Bloomberg. “With regret, I think we have to fold.” Established in 2004, Enel Russia PJSC contributes just over 1pc of the company’s overall gross operating profit. On Friday, Starace said that Enel would reduce its exposure to Russia but wasn’t planning a full exit. Other major energy companies, including BP, Shell and Italy’s Eni, have already announced plans to exit their investments in Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. A China Eastern Airlines plane carrying 132 people has crashed in China’s southwestern province of Guangxi, Bloomberg report. According to FlightRadar24, flight MU5735 - a Boeing 737 plane - was traveling from Kunming to Guangzhou when radar tracking showed a sudden steep descent. Eyewitness videos posted to social media showed a mountainous crash that sparked a fire, with flames and smoke billowing from the scene. China Eastern’s website, mobile app and some of its social media platforms were turned to black and white in a sign of mourning. The crash was confirmed by the Civil Aviation Administration of China, which said there were 123 passengers and nine crew members on board. China Eastern lost contact with the aircraft over Wuzhou, CAAC said. China’s aviation regulator said it has initiated its emergency response and dispatched a working group to the scene. Representatives for China Eastern and Boeing weren’t immediately available for comment. Shares of Boeing fell 6.8pc to $179.97 in pre-market U.S. trading. Russia’s ability to stave off default will be tested again today as it faces the first of several deadlines for debt payments worth more than $2.6bn (£1.97bn). Moscow narrowly avoided its first external bond default - when a country cannot or will not pay back national debts - in more than a century as it began making payments of $117m on two dollar bonds last week. But the pressure will ramp up further from Monday - the deadline for a fresh $66m debt interest payment. It is the first of multiple due this month which are worth a total $615m, before Russia then faces a $2bn bond payment on April 4. Moscow’s biggest airport has put around 7,000 employees on furlough and slashed their pay in a sign that Russia is preparing for a prolonged period of international isolation, my colleague Simon Foy writes. Sheremetyevo Airport, which was the country’s busiest international transport hub prior to the invasion of Ukraine, furloughed 40pc of its staff last week and cut their pay by a third, according to local media reports. Mikhail Vasilenko, the airport’s general director, wrote to staff saying the decision was “out of the control of the employer and employees” and connected to the “critical decrease in passenger traffic” triggered by Western sanctions, the reports said. Mr Vasilenko did not specify when the furlough period would end, heightening speculation that the airport was preparing for months of disruption. It comes after Western countries, including the UK, US and EU, imposed a slew of harsh sanctions against the Kremlin following its invasion of Ukraine, including closing their airspace to Russian-owned and Russian-registered aircraft. This has resulted in Russia only having permission to operate direct flights to a handful of countries, such as Belarus, Serbia and the United Arab Emirates. Before furloughing staff, Sheremetyevo had already mothballed two terminals at the airport since the outbreak of the war. Boris Johnson is expected to meet nuclear industry bosses today as he seeks to rally investment in new UK projects. The Prime Minister, who according to the Financial Times is ""gung ho"" for nuclear power, is set to host a roundtable event to discuss how to build a new generation of plants more quickly and cheaply. Nuclear power forms a key pillar of the Government's strategy to reach ""net zero"" carbon emissions by 2050, as it provides a stable baseload of energy to complement intermittent renewable sources such as wind and solar. However, in recent decades the proportion of energy generated by nuclear power has fallen in Britain. Kwasi Kwarteng, the Business Secretary, has said that has to change for the country to hit green targets. How?  Firstly, new nuclear. Needed when the the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine.We are reversing 30 years of drift with the first new power station in a generation, more cash for future large projects, and our Nuclear Bill to unblock financial obstacles.(6/9) — Kwasi Kwarteng (@KwasiKwarteng) February 28, 2022 Hong Kong has said it will relax anti-Covid-19 measures in April, lifting a ban on flights from nine countries including Britain, reducing quarantine for international arrivals and reopening schools. The moves, announced on Monday by chief executive Carrie Lam, come after a backlash from businesses and residents who see the rest of the world shifting to ""living with the virus"". Residents in the Chinese ruled territory have become increasingly frustrated with the stringent measures, many of which have been in place for over two years. A ban on flights from Australia, Britain, Canada, France, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines and the United States will be lifted from April 1. Meanwhile, hotel quarantine for arrivals could be cut to seven days from 14 if residents tested negative, and schools are set to resume face-to-face classes from April 19. Hong Kong's border has effectively been shut since 2020, with businesses and the city's economy left reeling from widespread closures. The UK is preparing to issue the first new North Sea drilling licences since 2020 as ministers scramble to firm up energy supplies that have been disrupted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. According to the Financial Times, the Oil and Gas authority is teeing up a new licensing round, having previously put them on hold to devise a new framework that would incorporate climate targets. Andy Samuel, the regulator's boss, said drilling licences for existing discoveries were now ""pretty much ready to go"". Boris Johnson has backed increasing domestic production of oil and gas as a way of reducing dependence on foreign imports. But it is likely to spark a fresh row with green campaigners, who have called for no new fossil fuel extraction to be commenced. Saudi Arabia's state oil company Aramco pledged on Sunday to hike investments by around 50pc this year as it reported a $110bn annual profit, Reuters reports. Under pressure from the West to boost output amid soaring prices, Aramco said it would boost capital spending from $31.9bn to $40-50bn this year. Asked if the company would pump more oil to fill gaps in the market left by the war in Ukraine, chief executive Amin Nasser said: We recognise energy security is paramount for billions of people around the world, which is why we continue to make progress on increasing our crude oil production capacity, executing our gas expansion programme and increasing our liquids to chemicals capacity. The company has said it plans to raise its crude oil ""maximum sustainable capacity"" to 13 million barrels a day by 2027, and wants to increase gas production by more than 50pc by 2030. It produced about 12.3 million barrels of oil per day last year. As the rising oil price puts upwards pressure on petrol forecourt prices - already at record highs - Rishi Sunak is eyeing a cut in fuel duty, our correspondents Charles Hymas and Tony Diver write today. Expectations that the levy could be reduced by 5p a litre have been raised ahead of the forthcoming Spring Statement after the Chancellor pledged to “stand by” hard-pressed householders facing “prohibitively expensive” petrol prices. Such a move is also said to have the backing of Boris Johnson, who “pushing” for a cut for motorists. Mr Sunak told the BBC’s Sunday Morning programme: “We recognise the importance of people being able to fill their cars up, and that not being prohibitively expensive.” Global markets could be denied 2.5 million barrels a day of Russian oil starting in April as sanctions take hold and buyers shun Russian supplies, the International Energy Agency (IEA) recently warned. Another 500,000 barrels a day may be ""shut in"", or kept back despite supplies being available. The agency said a move by its member countries to release 63m million barrels from emergency stocks would initially provide a buffer for markets but these could not address long-term supply issues. Only Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, two members of the Opec cartel, have the spare capacity to offset the potential supply shortfall markets are facing. But for now they are sticking to only modest production increases agreed by Opec. Boris Johnson recently visited the region to try and persuade the Saudis to turn on the taps, but came away empty-handed. France is among EU countries pushing for ""no taboos"" when it comes to Russian sanctions, as the bloc continues to weigh up an embargo on the country's oil. President Emmanuel Macron has said that if the situation worsens in Ukraine - where thousands have been killed, over 5 million have been displaced and cities devastated by shelling - then no measures should be ruled out, according to Reuters. For example, a Russian chemical weapons attack in Ukraine or heavy bombardment of the capital Kyiv, could be a trigger for an oil embargo, adding to a panopoly of already-punishing financial sanctions. Reuters quotes a French presidency official saying: These sanctions are meant to force President Putin into a new calculation. Among our partners and among the countries trading with Russia, there are some who are more sensitive on the issue of oil and gas. Nevertheless, the president (has) said, there is no taboo. Moscow has warned that EU sanctions on Russian oil could prompt it to close a major gas pipeline to Europe. The EU relies on Russia for 40pc of its gas, with Germany among the most dependent of the EU's large economies. Germany is also the largest EU buyer of Russian crude and has spoken against imposing an embargo. All EU sanctions decisions require consensus but France, which heads the EU's six-month presidency, will likely prove crucial. Good morning. Oil prices are climbing for the third session in a row as EU countries continue to weigh an embargo on Russian supplies ahead of a meeting with US President Joe Biden. With the Ukraine conflict showing little sign of easing, brent crude rose by more than 3pc to about $111 per barrel on Monday as traders bet that the market would continue to stay tight. It comes as a cut in fuel duty has been signalled by Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak, as they seek to ease the cost of living crisis facing families in the Spring Statement. It comes as EU governments are considering an oil embargo on Russia its invasion of Ukraine, on top of a punishing collection of sanctions already imposed. They had previously backed away from such a move but Baltic countries including Lithuania are still pushing for it, according to Reuters. Biden is due to arrive in Brussels for a Nato summit on Thursday. 1) Gove attacks ‘cartel’ of big property developers The Levelling Up Secretary opened a new front in his war with housebuilders amid a row over building safety. 2) M&S chairman warns of price rises Retailer's chairman says clothes and food will become more expensive after the war in Ukraine pushed up energy costs. 3) Chancellor breaks with Cabinet colleagues in P&O freeports row Rishi Sunak says involvement of ferry company's Dubai-based parent is separate to furore over sackings. 4) Go-Ahead expected to retain Govia Thameslink rail line Joint venture likely to continue running Britain's biggest rail franchise despite being booted off Southeastern and £26m fine 5) Russia facing fresh debt default test Despite making payments last week, Moscow still has $40bn of bonds outstanding and key payments are approaching.

3/21/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. equity futures and European equities stocks wavered Monday as crude oil extended a climb and investors monitored diplomatic efforts to bring an end to Russia’s almost month-old war in Ukraine. Most Read from Bloomberg Ukraine Update: Mariupol Refuses Russia Ultimatum; Kyiv Mall Hit Ukraine Update: Zelenskiy Says Some Opposition Parties Suspended Russia Uses Hypersonic Weapons as War Enters Bloodier Phase Hong Kong Signals Covid Shift by Cutting Flight Bans, Quarantine Where Mornings Would Get Darker Under Permanent Daylight Savings Time S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 contracts retreated, pointing to a pause after the underlying indexes posted their best weeks since November 2020. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index traded flat, as gains in miners and energy firms were offset by losses in travel and leisure companies. West Texas Intermediate oil rose toward $110 a barrel as investors assessed the war as well as Middle East tension. Australia’s ban on exports of alumina to Russia sparked an advance in aluminum. A gauge of the dollar advanced. A key question is whether last week’s stock rebound and drop in volatility are durable. European equities have recouped all of their losses triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine nearly a month ago as optimism around peace negotiations and the lure of cheapened valuations draw investors back. But a historic spike in commodity prices on supply concerns shows little sign of easing, keeping traders on high alert over inflation and shaking their faith in the Federal Reserve to douse price pressures while keeping the economic recovery on track. “The Fed comes out last week and basically tells you they have to do more -- into higher inflation but slowing growth,” Brian Weinstein, head of global fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, said in an interview with Bloomberg TV. “It certainly looks like the market is afraid of a traditional Fed goes too much, slows the economy down, and we don’t get the much-anticipated soft landing.” The bond market continues to flash caution about the economy. The Treasury yield curve is flattening, and portions are inverted, which for some is an indicator of a looming economic slowdown. The 10-year U.S. yield climbed to about 2.18%. Traders will monitor a speech later Monday by Fed Jerome Powell, less than a week after he and his colleagues kicked off a rate-hiking cycle. Markets expect the Fed to lift its target rate to around 2% by the end of this year. Meanwhile, U.S. President Joe Biden will speak with European leaders ahead of his trip to the continent this week. Senior U.S. officials will also meet with executives of Exxon Mobil Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other firms about the impact of the invasion and sanctions. The war in Ukraine and the resulting sanctions over Russia have sent the raw-materials markets into a tailspin, with the potential for shortages in key commodities like oil and wheat as exports are disrupted. Ukraine rejected a Russian demand that its forces lay down their arms Monday and leave the besieged southern port of Mariupol, which has been under intense Russian bombardment.

3/21/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- China Evergrande Group and its other units were suspended in Hong Kong Monday pending an announcement containing “inside information,” according to exchange filings that didn’t elaborate further. The embattled developer may hold a call this week to brief investors on its debt restructuring plan, REDD reported.

Ronshine’s stock and bonds plunged. Chinese high-yield dollar bonds traded flat to 2 cents higher with better quality names leading gains, according to credit traders. Property firms snapped a three-day stock rally, as the Bloomberg Intelligence gauge of developers fell 2.6%. Key Developments: China Evergrande and Its Units Suspend Trading in Hong Kong Evergrande May Hold Bond Talks After Onshore Deal: Credit React Ronshine China Says Auditor Resigns, to Delay Audited Report China Credit Investors Face Billions in Losses, Shrinking Power Country Garden’s Sliding Sales, Land-Spending Cut Set to Persist Hidden Debt Fears Unravel Lucrative Lifeline for China Builders China’s Property Policy Shift Doesn’t End Default Risks: Moody’s Evergrande Unit Gets Bondholders’ Nod to Delay Coupon Payment Evergrande to Hold Call on Restructuring: REDD (2:30 p.m. HK) Evergrande will hold a call this week to brief global investors on its restructuring framework, REDD reported, citing two sources briefed on the matter. The call might take place early in the week, according to the report. Evergrande didn’t immediately respond to a Bloomberg request for comment. Evergrande and Units Suspended in Hong Kong (2 p.m. HK) Evergrande and its other units suspended stock trading in Hong Kong Monday, according to exchange filings. The company’s onshore bonds were also suspended. Shenzhen-based Evergrande said in January that it aimed to present a preliminary restructuring proposal in the next six months and has been at the center of a crisis among Chinese property developers following Beijing’s crackdown on borrowing. Separately, Evergrande’s onshore unit said bondholders approved a payment plan regarding overdue yuan-bond interest, according to a statement on the Shenzhen stock exchange late Sunday. Hengda Real Estate Group Co. said it will distribute unpaid interest Sept. 23 for its 4 billion yuan ($629 million) 5.8% note maturing 2025. The bond’s coupon is due annually, and the first payment was scheduled for Sept. 23, 2021, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. Evergrande to Sell 30% of Nanjing Unit (9 a.m. HK) Evergrande Group’s onshore unit will sell its 30% stake in a Nanjing property company to AVIC Trust for an undisclosed sum, according to data from corporate registry search platform Tianyancha. The Nanjing property company, focused on valuation and management services, was set up in June 2020 with registered capital of 66.7 million yuan. The sale was earlier reported by The Paper on Sunday. Ronshine Says Auditor Resigns, to Delay Report (8:50 a.m. HK) Investors are bracing for more delays in Chinese developers’ 2021 results as Ronshine becomes the latest to announce the resignation of its auditor. Ronshine said it won’t file results by the end of March deadline as PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC was unable to complete its audit work partly because the supply of requested information had fallen behind schedule, the real estate firm said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange. Chinese property firms listed in Hong Kong face a March 31 deadline to file annual results, their first audited financial statements since the industry’s liquidity crisis spread. Transparency and governance concerns have cropped up alongside worries about developers’ ability to repay debt following a record number of defaults last year. At least four auditors have resigned or been replaced by builders since the start of this year, and global ratings firms have also pulled some assessments on property bonds due to insufficient information. Land Sales Slump in First Two Months (8:15 a.m. HK) Chinese local governments’ revenue from land sales contracted 29.5% in January-February from the same period a year ago, the biggest slump for the period since at least 2015 when comparable data began, data from the Ministry of Finance showed Friday. The figures underscore the impact the continued housing slump is having on government finances at a time when local authorities are under enormous pressure to bolster economic growth by spending more on infrastructure. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates that combined income from land sales and property-related taxes from the real estate sector shrank by 23.5% in January-February from a year ago, versus a 0.4% gain in December.

3/21/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Traders are beginning to re-evaluate the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on their strategies as the conflict grinds into a fourth week. Most Read from Bloomberg Ukraine Update: Mariupol Refuses Russia Ultimatum; Kyiv Mall Hit Ukraine Update: Zelenskiy Says Some Opposition Parties Suspended Russia Uses Hypersonic Weapons as War Enters Bloodier Phase Hong Kong Signals Covid Shift by Cutting Flight Bans, Quarantine Where Mornings Would Get Darker Under Permanent Daylight Savings Time The greenback edged higher against major peers as Asia trading began Monday, after its first weekly loss in a month, which came even as the Federal Reserve hiked rates. Japan’s yen was steady after hitting a six-year low. Gauges of volatility in currencies, bonds and stocks have fallen in recent days as investors took heart from news that China didn’t want to see the invasion of Ukraine amid U.S. warnings against supporting Russia. Meanwhile, Russia paid some dollar debts last week -- a relief to investors who feared the nation would use rubles and thereby trigger a default -- and China pledged to boost its economy. More talks on ending the war are expected on Monday after Turkey said the two sides had made progress on key points but heavy fighting continued over the weekend, particularly in Mariupol. With Russia on the hook for more foreign-currency payments in coming weeks, default risk remains significant. Trading in sovereign ruble bonds is poised to restart this week even as the nation’s stock market stays closed Monday. “Investors are focusing on a whole raft of cushions that have come in, from China’s policy stance on supporting growth to falling oil prices and a recalibration of the Ukraine situation -- it’s a perfect coincidence of relief factors coming just on time,” said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank in Singapore. “But while markets are happy to take relief where they can, there’s no sense of investors lurching from fear to greed anytime soon.” Fed Effect With a slew of central-bank meetings also in the rearview mirror, investors will be looking to parse the global effects of the Fed’s first rate hike since 2018, alongside last week’s decisions from the Bank of England and Japanese monetary authority. The next big question for markets is how many more hikes the Fed is planning for 2022 and what impact this will have on the U.S. economic outlook, with increased concern about recession following another inversion in the Treasury yield curve. A slew of Fed officials are set to speak this week, as are policy makers from the BOE and European Central Bank. Commodity-linked currencies remain in the spotlight due to the high price of natural resources. Australia has banned shipments to Russia of alumina, the key ingredient for producing aluminum. Japan, a major oil importer, has asked the United Arab Emirates to increase crude exports. Meanwhile, Russian regulators are still exploring ways to reopen the country’s equity market, which has been closed since late February. The Bank of Russia will begin purchasing domestic sovereign bonds on Monday in an effort to stabilize that market as it reopens. Uneasy Calm The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index finished last week down nearly 1%, with the greenback falling against all but one of its developed-market peers -- the yen. Japan’s currency faces further losses after its central bank recommitted to keeping its monetary policy easy. “We are seeing an uneasy calm in markets right now -- markets have bought Mr Powell’s messaging so far but they could easily have a second think about it this week, while Ukraine-Russia news remain volatile,” said Andrew Ticehurst, rates strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc. “Markets are completely subject to headline risk.” (Updates currency moves in second paragraph.)
