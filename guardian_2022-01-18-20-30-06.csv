1/18/2022,"She wowed Cop26 by castigating dithering global leaders for inflicting a “death sentence” on island nations and then made headlines around the world when she ditched the Queen as head of state, installing the singer Rihanna as an official national hero. On Wednesday, the Barbados prime minister, Mia Mottley, hopes her soaring international profile will translate into a second term when the country goes to the polls in a snap general election.  Like Rihanna, whose umbrella is now exhibit No 1 in the Museum of Barbados, Mottley is known locally just by her first name. Her Barbados Labour party (BLP), which won all 30 seats in the 2018 election, is running with the slogan: “It’s safer with Mia – stay the course.” Bumper stickers dismiss the opposition with the legend: “Dem rest ain’t ready.” Posters of the 56-year-old are on palm trees and lampposts across Barbados, declaring the smiling incumbent “strong and caring”. She called the election on 27 December, more than a year earlier than necessary. Her opponents accuse her of disenfranchising more than 5,500 Bajans who are in Covid-19 quarantine and will be unable to vote as the Omicron variant sweeps Barbados. On Monday night, Mottley embarked on a tour of the island, which has a population of 287,000. Arriving at a basketball court in Gall Hill in the eastern parish of St John, she danced to her dancehall campaign song Mia Encore and launched into a speech that concentrated on hyperlocal issues: craterous potholes that make driving in the east “like a Disneyland ride” and the upgrading of pit toilets – open latrines still common in some parts of an island famed as a playground for the rich and famous. Other campaign pledges include building 10,000 homes and developing a Barbadian wealth fund to give Bajans cash from government assets and land. Wearing gold hoop earrings and a red “Safer With Mia” branded jacket, she then rushed off to Carrington Village in St Michael on the west coast where she went on the defensive about the “fake news” briefings in the weekend papers. Lucille Moe, a former minister who is advising the opposition Democratic Labour party (DLP) after Mottley sacked her last year, called Mottley a dictator in an interview. “She is autocratic and does not allow anyone to have an opposing view or opinion. Everyone must be in the Mia Mottley choir,” said Moe. Mottley’s administration has also been criticised for accepting investment from the Chinese government, including a US$115m (£84m) loan for road repairs and $210m (£154m) to upgrade the water and sewage system on the south coast. But she was at pains to tell the loyal crowd in Gall Hill that she wanted wealth to stay in Barbados. “We are not only concentrating on people from overseas,” she said. Chinese contractors are rebuilding Sam Lord’s Castle, once the island’s landmark hotel. The BLP has pledged to divest its ownership of the site and offer shares in it “as an investment opportunity to ordinary Barbadians and to the credit union movement”. An MP since she was 28, Mottley is Barbados’s first female prime minster and the eighth since the island declared independence from the UK in 1966. The DLP, which was in power from 2008 to 2018 before its electoral wipeout, is largely trying to win votes by arguing Barbados needs an opposition. Its leader, Verla de Peiza, a UK-educated lawyer like Mottley, has spoken out against the “one-party state”. Her manifesto promises a more socially democratic Barbados, “much more than a cosmetic republic”, as well as a rethink of the island’s tourism industry to focus on “heritage tourism, eco-agro tourism, the yachting community and community-based tourism”. Pollsters predict a comfortable win for the BLP and Mottley, with the party losing a handful of seats to the DLP.",News/World news,Barbados PM who broke with Queen hopes for election boost,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/mia-mottley-barbados-pm-who-broke-with-queen-hopes-for-election-boost
1/18/2022,"Good morning. After winning more votes than any presidential candidate in US history, Joe Biden is now – just 12 months later – one of the country’s most unpopular presidents.  Much of his domestic agenda is stalled on Capitol Hill, impeded by members of his own party. The virus is once again raging out of control: daily infections of Covid-19 have soared to record levels, hospitalizing more Americans than at any previous point during the pandemic. The administration’s vaccine-or-testing mandate for large employers was blocked by the supreme court’s conservative supermajority. Inflation is at a nearly 40-year high. Diplomatic talks have so far failed to pull Russia back from the brink of war with Ukraine. The puzzle of Biden’s unpopularity has many pieces, pollsters and political analysts say. “There’s an element of it that has nothing to do with Joe Biden,” Sarah Longwell, a prominent anti-Trump Republican strategist said. “It’s just a tough time.” How unpopular is he? For months, Biden’s approval ratings have languished in the mid to low 40s, with an average approval rating of 42%. ​​A Quinnipiac poll released last week found him at a dire 33%. Aerial images prepared by the New Zealand defence force for the Tongan government have been leaked online and show some areas have had “catastrophic” devastation inflicted by the tsunami and volcanic eruption while others were relatively unscathed. The 40 aerial pictures show some areas blanketed with ash, with damaged buildings, while others show parts of the country that appear unscathed. They were taken by the New Zealand defence force during a reconnaissance flight on Monday and put together in a report for the Tongan government. The photos were then leaked online. The Guardian has confirmed the provenance of the photos. After the reconnaissance flight, the New Zealand defence force shared a handful of photos with the media, most of them showing defence personnel at work, rather than shots of the islands. The 40 leaked images paint a much fuller picture of the damage to the country, and include annotations about the severity of damage. Little has been heard from Tonga since the eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano and subsequent tsunami on Saturday, after the Pacific nation’s main communication cable was broken. The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack is weighing whether to subpoena some of Donald Trump’s top allies on Capitol Hill as it considers its options on how aggressively it should pursue testimony to move forward its inquiry into the January 6 insurrection. The Republican House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, and Republican members of Congress Jim Jordan and Scott Perry may have inside knowledge about Trump’s plan to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s election and whether it was coordinated with the Capitol attack. But the outright refusal of McCarthy and the other Republican lawmakers to testify voluntarily with the investigation has intensified discussions among the panel’s members and investigators about whether to force their cooperation. The select committee is undecided on whether to take that near-unprecedented step. Why are they hesitating? In part because of one major concern that has emerged in recent days, according to two sources familiar with the matter: Republican retaliation against Biden and Democrats in future inquiries. The vice-president, Kamala Harris, said on Monday that the right to vote in America was “under assault”. The speech was given on the Martin Luther King day public holiday and comes as King’s family push for expanded federal voting rights legislation despite opposition from Republicans. The cocktail of chemical pollution that pervades the planet now threatens the stability of global ecosystems upon which humanity depends, scientists have said. Plastic pollution is now found from the summit of Mount Everest to the deepest oceans. A British man who flew to the US, acquired a gun and took hostages at a Texas synagogue had a criminal record and an extensive history of mental health issues, the Guardian understands. Malik Faisal Akram was killed after a tense 11-hour hostage standoff at the Congregation Beth Israel synagogue. Joss Whedon, the Buffy creator and director of films including The Avengers and Justice League, has responded to allegations of misconduct, denying claims from actors including Gal Gadot and Ray Fisher that he threatened and belittled them on set. The estate of the late pop singer Prince, including his catalogue of songs, has been valued at $156.4m (£114m), nearly double the figure arrived at by an earlier appraisal. The estate’s administrator, Comerica Bank, agreed on the figure with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the heirs to Prince’s estate. The singer died in 2016 without a will, and his estate will pass to three of his siblings as well as the publishing company Primary Wave, who in August 2021 bought rights to the Prince catalogue from another three heirs, two of them deceased. For centuries the symptoms of menopause were documented, but women went through it with little intervention. It wasn’t until the advent of science as we know it that physicians (all male at the time, obviously) started more commonly “treating” its symptoms. Suffice it to say, the history of misogyny in medicine goes way, way back, all founded in the idea of women as inferior, and of menstrual blood as evil and poisonous. ExxonMobil is attempting to use an unusual Texas law to target and intimidate its critics, claiming that lawsuits against the company over its long history of downplaying and denying the climate crisis violate the US constitution’s guarantees of free speech. The US’s largest oil firm is asking the Texas supreme court to allow it to use the law, known as rule 202, to pursue legal action against more than a dozen California municipal officials. Marlon Bundo, the family pet rabbit of the former vice-president Mike Pence, has died, marking the end of an unlikely career as a prominent gay rights figure in the US. Political pets are a common theme in American politics but Bundo’s high media profile was unusual. Firstly, he featured in a series of children’s books written by the second family. Secondly, as a parody of Pence’s deep social conservatism, Bundo was also the main theme of a satirical book by the comedian John Oliver that chronicled his search for a same-sex bunny partner.

1/18/2022,"Owen Farrell will resume the England captaincy for the Six Nations after he was named in Eddie Jones’s 36-man squad but there is no place for Manu Tuilagi. Jones has named six uncapped players including the Wasps forward Alfie Barbeary and the Bath fly-half Orlando Bailey and confirmed Farrell, who is yet to make his comeback from an injury sustained in the autumn, as his captain. It is a show of faith from Jones considering Farrell came into last year’s Six Nations, in which England finished a dismal campaign in fifth place, similarly undercooked but the 30-year-old is expected to make his return from an ankle injury for Saracens on Sunday. Bailey’s selection, meanwhile, and that of Marcus Smith means there is no recall for George Ford despite his outstanding form for Leicester.  Tuilagi was also injured during the autumn and has pencilled in Sale’s match against his former club Leicester on 30 January for his comeback. Given the 36 players chosen by Jones will not be available for club duty that weekend Tuilagi has been omitted but is expected to join up with the squad at a later date. Barbeary is rewarded for his fine form for Wasps, having shaken off a disruptive run of injuries, while Bailey comes in as a rookie fly-half following a first call-up. They are two of six uncapped players selected by Jones with Leicester’s Ollie Chessum, London Irish’s Ollie Hassell-Collins, Luke Northmore of Harlequins and Northampton’s Tommy Freeman also selected. Elsewhere, there is a return to the squad for Jack Nowell, who has found form again for Exeter, but no reprieve for either Mako or Billy Vunipola. Elliot Daly is conspicuous by his absence, having returned from the injury which ruled him out of England’s autumn campaign. Sam Underhill also misses out. Farrell, however, is part of the Saracens contingent in which Jones continues to trust and his decision to confirm him as captain, even before he has made his comeback, is telling. Courtney Lawes was a popular stand-in during the autumn but Jones has moved to assuage any doubts as to who his on-field leader is. Of the uncapped players, Barbeary’s selection is arguably the most exciting given the hype that surrounds the 21-year-old back-rower. Hassell-Collins and Freeman have been on the fringes before but Chessum is rewarded for his fine form for Leicester, edging out Worcester’s Kyle Hatherell and Saracens’ Nick Isiekwe, as is the versatile Northmore. Jones said: “Selecting this squad has been a difficult task, we’ve got plenty of good young players coming through and some of our more experienced [players] are rediscovering their best form. We think this 36 for the first training week reflects a good balance of that experience and up-and-coming talent. “In Brighton we’ll focus on getting the fundamentals of our game in play right and developing the cohesion of the team. The Six Nations is going to be the most competitive we’ve ever seen. All the countries performed well in the autumn, so we need to be at our best and improve with every game.”",Sport/Sport,Farrell captain and uncapped Barbeary named in England’s Six Nations squad,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/18/farrell-captain-and-uncapped-barbeary-named-in-englands-six-nations-squad
1/18/2022,"Four years ago, Debra Lekanoff was busy traveling across the nation in her role as governmental affairs director for the Swinomish Tribe when her daughter came to her, worried. The 14-year-old had just learned some of the troubling details of the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous women and was concerned that her mother, who is Alaska Native and tended to travel alone, might one day not make it home.  Lekanoff said she remembers her daughter asking her: “Isn’t there a way where we could let everybody know when we get stolen?” Today, as a Washington state Democratic representative and the only Native American member of the state legislature, Lekanoff is working to do just that. Earlier this month she helped introduce legislation that would implement an alert system specifically for missing Indigenous people. If passed, the system would be a first in the US. It is expected not only to help locate the individual and improve communication between law enforcement agencies and local jurisdictions, but also to increase awareness about the crisis of missing Indigenous people, particularly women and girls. American Indian and Alaska Native women in Washington go missing at a rate more than four times higher than the state’s white residents, according to a 2019 report by the Urban Indian Health Institute, a division of the Seattle Indian Health Board. In a 2018 report, the institute found that of the 29 states surveyed, Washington had the second highest number of cases of missing and murdered American Indian and Alaska Native women and girls. Lekanoff, who is Tlingit and Aleut, said the system will convey to Washingtonians “that this isn’t just an Indian issue, this is really a crisis that all Washingtonians need to take responsibility for. We want to hear her screams when she’s being torn away from her family. And this alert system is her scream.” The proposed alert system would function similarly to “silver alerts”, which are used in Washington and dozens of other states across the nation to help locate missing vulnerable people. The idea is that when an Indigenous person is reported missing, law enforcement could activate the alert, resulting in details about the person being broadcast via highway advisory radio messages, signs and press releases for the media. “The more this is in the dark corners of our state and that we’re not talking about [it] and we’re not sharing information, the more this crisis is going to continue,” said Washington attorney general Bob Ferguson, who worked with Lekanoff on the legislation. “I think an important step, one of many, but an important step to address the crisis, is to daylight it.” Some tribal leaders across the state have also voiced their support for the legislation. But given the many years this crisis has gone on, there have also been questions about why such a system wasn’t implemented long ago. “This is something that could have been enacted very quickly early on when we became of knowledge of how severe this issue was,” said Puyallup Tribal Councilwoman Anna Bean. “It’s something that we could have put in place, like a long time ago.” But, she added: “It’s being brought to the table now, and something’s being done. And I’m just very thankful for that.” Bean, who is also a member of the Washington State Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and People Task Force, described the Puyallup Tribe, whose reservation lies along the US Interstate 5 corridor, as practically a “stomping ground” for trafficking and other types of crimes that results in disappearances. She said this type of alert system could make a big difference in these cases, when timely, accurate dissemination of information on a disappearance is vital. Just a few years ago, Andy Joseph Jr, who chairs the Colville Business Council, the governing body of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, said his own family found themselves in the middle of one of these devastating situations when the boyfriend of his daughter’s sister-in-law took their young children. The man was caught in part thanks to the community’s posts on Facebook. But Joseph said he believes the man could have been found even quicker if an alert system like the one proposed had been in place. “I think it would make our people feel a lot safer and also I think the perpetrators might think a little bit more before they would attempt to do anything like this, because they probably know that they’d been pinned or tagged,” he said. Some tribal officials have recommended that the alert include elements such as a photograph of the missing individual, and that the system be automated, rather than law enforcement activating the alerts, so that no one gets missed. Officials have also suggested improving data gathering on the wider crisis, so that more is understood about the issue and the impact of such an alert system. Lekanoff said the finer details of the system would be worked out in consultation with the 29 federally recognized tribes in Washington. She said that the proposal has received bipartisan support from lawmakers and with the legislative session kicking off last week she’s hopeful it will pass.Lekanoff talked about the red handprint over the mouth, which has become a symbol of the missing and murdered Indigenous movement. She said: “The alert system is removing that hand. It is unleashing the screams of those women who are being stolen or murdered from their families, from their children, from their communities.”",News/World news,‘This alert is her scream’: new system would help locate missing Indigenous women,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/washington-state-system-locating-missing-indigenous-women
1/18/2022,"ExxonMobil is attempting to use an unusual Texas law to target and intimidate its critics, claiming that lawsuits against the company over its long history of downplaying and denying the climate crisis violate the US constitution’s guarantees of free speech. The US’s largest oil firm is asking the Texas supreme court to allow it to use the law, known as rule 202, to pursue legal action against more than a dozen California municipal officials. Exxon claims that in filing lawsuits against the company over its role in the climate crisis, the officials are orchestrating a conspiracy against the firm’s first amendment rights.  The oil giant also makes the curious claim that legal action in the California courts is an infringement of the sovereignty of Texas, where the company is headquartered. Eight California cities and counties have accused Exxon and other oil firms of breaking state laws by misrepresenting and burying evidence, including from its own scientists, of the threat posed by rising temperatures. The municipalities are seeking billions of dollars in compensation for damage caused by wildfires, flooding and other extreme weather events, and to meet the cost of building new infrastructure to prepare for the consequences of rising global temperatures. Rule 202 in effect allows corporations to go on a fishing expedition for incriminating evidence. They are able to question individuals under oath and demand access to documents even before any legal action is filed against them. Exxon wants to use the provision to force the California officials to travel to Texas to be questioned by the firm’s lawyers about what the company describes as “lawfare” – the misuse of the legal system for political ends. Exxon claims in a petition to the Texas supreme court that it is entitled to question the officials in order to collect evidence of “potential violations of ExxonMobil’s rights in Texas to exercise its first amendment privileges” to say what it likes about climate science. “The potential defendants’ lawfare is aimed at chilling the speech of not just ExxonMobil, but of other prominent members of the Texas energy sector on issues of public debate, in this case, climate change,” the company claims in its petition. The oil giant’s critics say Exxon’s attempt to use claims of free speech to curtail the first amendment rights of others follows a pattern of harassment toward those who challenge the company’s claims about the climate crisis. Patrick Parenteau, a law professor and former director of the Environmental Law Center at Vermont law school, has described the company’s move as “intimidation” intended to make “it cost a lot and be painful to take on Exxon” whether or not the company wins its case. In a highly unusual move, Texas’s governor, Greg Abbott, has written to the all-Republican court – half of whose members he appointed – in support of Exxon. He accused the California litigants of attempting “to suppress the speech of eighteen Texas-based energy companies on the subject of climate and energy policies”. “When out-of-state officials try to project their power across our border, as respondents have done by broadly targeting the speech of an industry crucial to Texas, they cannot use personal jurisdiction to scamper out of our courts and retreat across state lines,” Abbott wrote. In backing its claim, Exxon’s petition to the Texas supreme court gives the example of the Oakland city attorney, Barbara Parker, who in 2017 “issued a press release seeking to stifle the speech of the Texas energy sector or, as she likes to refer to it, ‘BIG OIL’”. The press release said: “It is past time to debate or question the reality of global warming … Just like BIG TOBACCO, BIG OIL knew the truth long ago and peddled misinformation to con their customers and the American public.” The company also names the then San Francisco city attorney, Dennis Herrera, because he accused fossil fuel companies of launching a “disinformation campaign to deny and discredit” the reality of global heating, and pledged to hold the companies responsible “to account”. Exxon has, in addition, targeted an environmental lawyer in Boston, Matthew Pawa, who represents some of the California municipalities. The firm describes him as “an outspoken advocate of misusing government power to limit free speech” and alleges that Pawa “recruited” the California cities and counties to sue Exxon. “Those lawsuits are an affront to the first amendment,” the company claims. Naomi Oreskes, a Harvard professor and co-author of Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming, said Exxon had a long history of attempting to bully its critics into silence. “Now that the arguments have moved into the legal sphere, this feels to me like an extension of the sort of harassment, bullying and intimidation that we’ve seen in the scientific sphere for the last two decades,” she said. Oreskes said that the legal strategy is also part of a broader public relations campaign to paint the company as a victim of radical environmentalists and opportunistic politicians when Exxon argues that it should be heralded for its efforts to combat the climate crisis. “Exxon Mobil has for a long time now tried to make themselves out to be the victim, as if somehow they’re the innocent innocent party here,” she said. The Texas supreme court is considering the case after a lower court backed Exxon’s attempts to use rule 202 against the California officials. The ruling was later overturned on appeal. The appeal court sympathised with Exxon by acknowledging “an impulse to safeguard an industry that is vital to Texas’s economic well-being” and saying that “lawfare is an ugly tool by which to seek the environmental policy changes” pursued by California municipalities. But the appeal court said the defendants did not have sufficient direct connection to Texas for the case to be heard in the state. Exxon has tried to head off climate litigation before with lawsuits claiming that the attorney generals of Massachusetts and New York were violating the company’s rights by investigating it. Those moves were blocked by the Massachusetts supreme court and by a federal court. If the Texas supreme court allows its rule 202 bid to proceed, Exxon might expect a more sympathetic hearing for its claims in a state court system that has shown deference to big oil. Exxon is facing a barrage of other lawsuits across the US. A number accuse the company and other fossil fuel firms of breaching consumer protection laws by propagating misinformation about climate science. Oreskes said Exxon went further than most other oil companies in seeking to hide the evidence of its own scientists collected about global heating and in running a disinformation campaign. “They’re pushing their freedom of speech as an issue because more than any other company, it’s been proven by people like me and others that they have a track record of promoting half truths, misrepresentations and in some cases outright lies in the public sphere,” she said. “This is so well documented that unless they can come up with some strategy to defend it, they’re in potentially pretty serious trouble.” This story is published as part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of news outlets strengthening coverage of the climate story",News/Environment,How Exxon is leveraging Texas courts to silence its climate critics,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/18/exxon-texas-courts-critics-climate-crimes
1/18/2022,"A Chinese human rights activist and writer who was detained following repeated pleas to be allowed to visit his terminally ill wife has been formally arrested days after she died for allegedly “inciting subversion of state power”. Yang Maodong, who goes by the pen-name Guo Feixiong, was formally arrested on Monday last week by the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, two days after the death of his wife, Zhang Qing.  An arrest document stated he was arrested “on suspicion of inciting subversion of state power”, and was being held at the Guangzhou No 1 detention centre. Yang’s arrest was first reported by the online Rights Protection Network group. Yang is a prominent human rights activist and legal consultant known for working with Taishi villagers protesting against corruption in 2005, after which he was jailed. He has been harassed, reportedly beaten, and in and out of detention for years, including a total of 11 years in prison, where Human Rights Watch said he was subjected to torture, including electric shocks. In 2009, Zhang and their children fled to the US, where she advocated for Yang’s release. After Zhang was diagnosed with a terminal illness in January 2021, Yang made repeated requests to Chinese authorities to let him go to his wife and children, but was refused on unspecified national security grounds. “You public servants are also husbands, [blessed with] marital love, must also have empathy of ordinary people,” he wrote to China’s premier, Li Keqiang, and the minister of public security, Zhao Kezhi, at the time. Dozens of academics, foreign politicians and human rights groups expressed concern about the case. Yang was detained again in December. From the US, Zhang pleaded with Chinese authorities to let Yang join his family. “I’m in a critical condition. Things are particularly hard in these cold winter days – we, my family, need him,” she told the South China Morning Post. “Never could I imagine the Chinese authorities were capable of such inhumane cruelty – to keep him locked up when my life is coming to an end, it’s very shocking to me.” The couple had not seen each other in 15 years. Yang could face more than five years in prison, according to Sui Muqing, a Chinese human rights lawyer, who also said it was unlikely Yang would go to trial before six months to a year. “There won’t be any credible evidence, all charges and evidence are arbitrarily fabricated, and the purpose of arresting him is to block his voice,” he said.",News/World news,Chinese activist told he could not visit dying wife is re-arrested,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/chinese-activist-yang-maodong-told-he-could-not-visit-dying-wife-is-re-arrested
1/18/2022,"The British man who took hostages at a Texas synagogue had been under investigation by MI5 as a possible Islamist terrorist threat as recently as 2020, Whitehall sources acknowledged on Tuesday morning. British intelligence closed the investigation, however, after officers had concluded Malik Faisal Akram from Blackburn posed no threat, and as a result he was able to freely travel to the US and purchase a gun.  It is understood the investigation was “mid-level” and took place “in the second half of 2020” – but once it had ended Akram was left as a closed subject of interest on MI5’s records, and no information of concern appears to have been passed to the US authorities before the synagogue attack. The acknowledgement is a particular embarrassment to the agency, which prides itself on a close working relationship with its US counterparts. Akram, a 44-year-old from Blackburn, was killed after an 11-hour hostage standoff at the Congregation Beth Israel synagogue in the Dallas suburb of Colleyville on Saturday evening. All four hostages survived the siege and were unharmed.

1/18/2022,"Shares in THG have fallen sharply after the online shopping group warned profit margins for 2021 would come in below expectations and the early part of 2022 would be more challenging compared with the same period last year when global lockdowns fuelled sales. The company, founded and run by Matthew Moulding, announced on Tuesday that margins for 2021 would be 7.4% to 7.7%, against estimates of 7.9%, but should recover this year. Its shares fell 9% after the update, to 169p, well below the float price of 500p in September 2020.  Manchester-based THG (formerly known as The Hut Group), which runs beauty and nutrition websites including Lookfantastic, Cult Beauty and Myprotein, made record annual sales of £2.2bn in its first full year as a public company, up 37.9% on 2020 and helped by acquisitions. Sales grew 27% in the fourth quarter to £711.7m. Moulding has pinned his hopes on the growth of Ingenuity, a division building direct-to-consumer websites for other companies. It increased sales by 42.7% to £57.4m, making it the fastest-growing division between October and December. THG warned that the early part of 2022 would be more challenging because of the tough annual comparison and record commodity prices within the nutrition division. It expects revenue growth of 22% to 25% this year, including £108m to £112m sales from Ingenuity. Russ Mould, an investment director at AJ Bell, said: “The only way THG is going to win back the market’s favour is if it delivers better than expected figures consistently for at least two or three quarters. Unfortunately, its latest update doesn’t pass the test as it flags margins are slightly below expectations. “Under normal circumstances, a business delivering the level of growth seen in THG’s latest update would be applauded by the market. Sadly, THG has shot itself in the foot thanks to the way it has behaved as a listed company since joining the stock market. And that means only something spectacular will lift the share price.” THG has been through a torrid 12 months on the stock market after its £4.5bn flotation turned out to be the biggest London stock market debut since 2013. Its shares, which had soared after the group floated, slumped more than 70% in 2021. The drop cost its investors, among which Moulding is the biggest shareholder, about £6.9bn in paper losses. Moulding has alleged the company’s shares have been unfairly targeted. THG handed over a dossier of data to the Financial Conduct Authority, the UK’s financial watchdog, last week after observing irregular trading of its shares. Moulding has claimed hedge funds colluded in a “pretty aggressive short attack” on THG’s shares last year. The shares were affected in November after it emerged that BlackRock, the retailer’s largest institutional shareholder, was halving its stake. Moulding and the business have attracted criticism for his role as both executive chair and chief executive, which is against best corporate governance practice. The board also signed off a pre-flotation deal that saw Moulding acquire THG’s offices, warehouses and leisure facilities, before immediately becoming the company’s landlord by leasing those buildings back to the company for an annual rent of £19m. “Failure to deliver the level of detail about the business desired by investors, questionable corporate governance standards, and comments by chief executive Matt Moulding that he wished he’d never floated THG all amount to bad practice as far as investors are concerned, and they’ve voted with their feet which has left the share price languishing well below its IPO price,” Mould added. Moulding said on Tuesday the firm’s achievements in 2021 included the opening of its 1m sq ft UK technology campus. It hired 3,000 people last year, mostly in the UK. “Despite challenging conditions, we have scaled revenue and expanded our business model, particularly THG Ingenuity, well ahead of expectations given at our initial public offering 16 months ago,” he said. “The new year has started well, and we remain confident in delivering our strategic growth plans during 2022 and beyond.”",News/Business,THG shares slide as it misses profit margin forecasts,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/18/thg-shares-profit-sales

Regrettably, it is not Kermit the Frog. The thing that appears in all of these works has no easily recognisable familiar name, although it is perhaps one of the most recognisable three-beat musical phrases in history. It starts with a dun; it continues with a dun; it ends with a duuun! On screen, a dramatic “dun, dun duuun” has appeared in everything from Disney’s Fantasia to The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air to The IT Crowd. In 2007, a YouTuber scored a video of a melodramatic prairie dog with the three beats, earning over 43m views and a solid place in internet history. Yet though many of us are familiar with the sound, no one seems to know exactly where it came from. Try to Google it and … dun, dun, duuun! Its origins are a mystery.  Taken together, these three duns are what’s known as a sting – a brief bit of music that media producers can use to break up the action or punctuate a theatrical moment. While today’s dun dun duuuns are often employed jokingly to parody the dramas of days gone by, the suspenseful sound was once legitimately used to frighten and thrill. “One of the challenges of radio – and it’s the same now as it was 100 years ago – is how do you hook the listener?” says Richard Hand, a media professor at the University of East Anglia and author of Terror on the Air! Horror Radio in America, 1931-1952. Alongside orchestral stings, sound effects such as clock chimes, claps of thunder, and whistling wind were used to grab the audience’s attention in the early days of radio, as the medium has always invited multitasking.“Those dramatic organ stings could have a powerful effect.” Before the development of sound libraries, many of these stings were performed live. “They became cliched and we laugh at them, but actually what soundscapes can do can be extraordinary.” Suspense, an American horror show broadcast on CBS Radio between 1942 and 1962, was filled to the brim with sound effects and dramatic stings. Just over three minutes into its first episode (after bells, the sound of a train, and plenty of piano), a three-beat sting lingers on its last note when a man discovers his wife is potentially an undead poisoner. But it’s difficult to pinpoint the very first on-air dun dun duuun, and it’s likely the musical phrase predates the radio. Hand says the medium tended to adopt already popular tropes to entice listeners. “They imported that musical structure and musical language,” he says, pointing to Victorian stage melodramas. In fact, Patrick Feaster – an expert in the preservation of early sound media, and co-founder of the First Sounds Initiative – argues that dun dun duuun could have been a cliche long before the advent of radio drama. Though he doesn’t know when or where the three duns arose, he points out that stings “that work in much the same way” appeared in the 1912 melodrama parody Desperate Desmond by comedian Fred Duprez. In a recording of the sketch which can be heard on the US Library of Congress website, Duprez mocks melodramas by telling a story and rebutting the incongruous sounds that play between the action (when a villain enters with a dramatic sting and a clip-clop, he exasperatedly says, “Not on a horse! Just on his feet!”). Though the stings heard in this sketch are single duns (sans the follow -up dun and duuun), Feaster says: “It seems stinger chords must have been entrenched enough in melodrama by 1912 to invite parody.” He guesses that the three-beat version may have then come to be preferred for satire, “because it’s more conspicuous than a single all-at-once chord would be.” Producers continued to enjoy parodying dramatic stings on radio shows throughout the 20th century – The Goon Show in the 1950s regularly ridiculed audio tropes in mock detective stories such as The Dreaded Piano Clubber. Occasionally, three duns were still used for dramatic effect in film: In 1940’s Fantasia, Disney’s recording of Stravinsky’s 1913 Rite of Spring emphasised two duns and a lingering duuun at the end of a dinosaur battle (though the composer’s original features a similar three beats, they’re not as pronounced or as recognisable as the sound we know today). From Tom and Jerry to Ren and Stimpy, dun dun duuuns also cropped up in cartoons, ensuring the sound became a television mainstay. Young Frankenstein’s version debuted in the 1970s, and it was this recording that was used for the dramatic prairie dog viral vid. But since 1984, if you’ve heard a dun dun duuun vibrating from your television set, it’s likely it came from one specific source. “It’s like having a Penguin Classic,” says 74-year-old composer Dick Walter, who has arranged music for programmes such as The Two Ronnies and The Morecambe & Wise Show. In 1983, recordings library KPM Music asked Walter to produce four vinyl albums of musical phrases known as The Editor’s Companion. With an orchestral lineup of around 35 to 40 people, Walter recorded hundreds of tracks over the course of 18 months, including chase music, sleighbells, and a four-second, three-beat sting called Shock Horror (A) that comprises the notes D#, C and F#. “It’s musical shorthand which says a lot very quickly,” Walter says of the first of five melodramatic exclamations that run all the way down to Shock Horror (E). But where did he find the inspiration? Walter’s mother, an amateur pianist, used to play Edwardian and Victorian melodrama in the house, while he was a lover of jazz as a teen. He explains that for centuries, composers have used a particular musical interval to denote tension. Its name? Diabolus in musica – or “the devil’s interval” to you and me. The devil’s interval is a dissonant combination of tones that unsettles the listener because it is unresolved. You’ve likely heard the devil’s interval as the opening two notes to The Simpson’s theme tune, as well as the beginning of Maria from West Side Story (Walter helpfully sings both). Yet in both cases, the tension is immediately resolved with the next note, producing a pleasant effect. “But if you don’t resolve it, you’re left feeling unsatisfied,” Walter explains, “That’s what it boils down to.” When Walter was charged with creating horror stings for The Editor’s Companion, “the obvious thing to do” for Shock Horror (A) was use the interval – his is “just an extremely abbreviated version, about as short as you can get”. A few years ago, he was happy to hear his sting played on BBC radio show I’m Sorry I Haven’t a Clue, realising “it’s obviously become a bit of a go-to thing”. This is an understatement – The recording has since been used in SpongeBob SquarePants, Roseanne, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and Beavis and Butt-Head, as well as adverts for cereal, snacks and a home improvement store. While some producers may prefer to create their own version, Walter’s sting has become an easy staple – the bread and butter of dun, dun, duuuns. There is – dramatic pause! – no way of knowing where it will end up next. “I think the thing that makes Shock Horror eminently usable is that it’s orchestral, so it’s quite big,” Walter says of the track’s appeal. “So in one sense, it doesn’t date. It’s sort of timeless.”",Arts/Music,"Dun, Dun Duuun! Where did pop culture’s most dramatic sound come from?

1/18/2022,"Graham Thorpe, England’s assistant coach, could be under pressure for his job after a video he shot of Tasmanian police shutting down an early hours drinking session involving players from both Ashes teams became public. Joe Root, the England captain, Jimmy Anderson and Thorpe, as well as Australian players Nathan Lyon, Alex Carey and Travis Head, were the subject of a noise complaint at the team hotel in Hobart at 6am on Monday morning which saw four police officers in attendance.  The incident was filmed by Thorpe and the video first appeared on the website of the Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday. In it an officer is heard telling the group: “Too loud. You have obviously been asked to pack up, so we’ve been asked to come. Time for bed. Thank you. They just want to pack up.” All five players agreed to the request and left the outdoor terrace for their rooms. The events came after Australia wrapped up a 4-0 series win at 10pm the previous evening, with the usual end of series drinks between the teams in the dressing rooms then moving back to their shared lodgings in Hobart city centre at around 2.30am. Linda Collis, the general manager of the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Hobart, told the Sydney Morning Herald that nothing untoward took place and the complaint – said to be about the volume of the music being played – came from outside of the hotel. The England management appear to be reasonably sanguine about the drinking given the late finish to the day-night fifth Test at the end of a long series and have issued a public apology for the disturbance that saw the group asked to move on. Cricket Australia have declined to comment on the incident. But the Guardian understands the England hierarchy are now looking into why Thorpe decided to film the events – naming four of the five players while doing so and saying it was “for the lawyers” – before then seemingly sharing this externally.An England spokesperson said: “During the early hours of Monday morning, members of the England and Australia men’s teams shared a drink in the team areas of the hotel in Hobart.“The hotel management received a noise complaint, and as is commonplace in Australia, the local police attended the scene. When asked to leave by hotel management and the Tasmanian police, the players and management in question left and returned to their respective hotel rooms. The England party have apologised for any inconvenience caused.“The ECB will investigate further. Until such times, we will make no further comment.” Coming after a heavy series defeat, and with Root, the captain, Chris Silverwood, the head coach, and Ashley Giles, the director of cricket, already under pressure for their jobs following a campaign riddled with strategic errors, the video’s emergence could scarcely be timed worse for England in terms of perception. Thorpe, the former England batter, has recently been interviewed for the vacant head coach role at Middlesex and so appears to be looking to leave. But after five Tests in which the players failed with the bat, this latest development could now expedite his departure from the international setup. A statement from Tasmania police read: “Tasmania Police attended the Crowne Plaza Hobart on Monday morning after reports were made of intoxicated people in a function area. The guests were spoken to by police, just after 6am, and left the area when asked. No further action will be taken by police.” The early finish to the Test match has seen the majority of England’s touring party forced to remain in Hobart while waiting for their scheduled flights home on Wednesday. Australia’s players continued their celebrations at various pubs in Hobart on Monday before returning to their respective states the following day.",Sport/Sport,Thorpe’s England job under threat over video of police shutting down post-Ashes party,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/18/graham-thorpe-england-job-under-threat-over-video-of-police-shutting-down-post-ashes-party
