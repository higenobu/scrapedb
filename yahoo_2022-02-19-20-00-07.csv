2/19/2022,"The unsung star of Jurassic Park was a mosquito frozen in amber. While you can’t really extract blood from specimens like that, you could be transported back in time if you looked at a specimen of fossilized tree sap and found a 110 million-year-old lizard staring back at you. Creatures get trapped in amber all the time, but most prehistoric finds are insects. Amber is a great material for preserving arthropods because of their already tough shells that will hold on even if the insides disintegrate. But what about a lizard? Rhetinosaurus hkamentiensis is a new extinct species of lizard that was unexpectedly found trapped in Burmese amber. No one expected an entire reptile to be preserved so well, from its scaly skin down to its skeleton. What are now the empty eyes of Rhetinosaurus may have once seen dinosaurs or giant ferns or dragonflies the size of your head. It was determined to be a juvenile that ran into a sticky situation when it ran into a glob of tree amber that it couldn’t escape. It was so well preserved that paleontologist Andrej Čerňanský of Comenius University and his team, who recently published a study in Nature, approached the prehistoric lizard almost as if it were alive. “Its vertebrae are mostly cartilaginous, so we were able to study not only a skeleton, but even the external appearance (scalation) of the lizard,” Čerňanský told SYFY WIRE. ""In fact, we can study the animal in the same way that herpetologists study modern species.” Photo: Joseph Bevitt/Edward Stanley/Andrej Čerňanský et al Rhetinosaurus may be no dinosaur (“saurus” actually means “lizard”). CT scanning can be problematic sometimes, but the unreal preservation of the lizard — so much as the double eyelids of the left eye are still there — helped the researchers turn scans into eerily lifelike renderings of a creature that has not walked the Earth since the mid-Cretaceous. Its organs may have not made it, but the trachea and bronchi were preserved. By taking a closer look at the skeleton and patterns of the scales, they were able to make out that it was not yet mature. This tiny lizard could have huge implications for how its successors ended up where they are now. Morphological comparisons were used to find its closest surviving relatives, as well as phylogenetic analysis, which finds out evolutionary connections through genetic sequencing. What the researchers found from physical studies of the specimen and its fragmented DNA were that it is a scincoid (meaning it resembles a skink) that echoes the features of some xantusiids, which are endemic to North America. So how did the fossil end up in Myanmar? It is possible that Rhetinosaurus spawned somewhere else when its territory moved elsewhere. “This is complicated, because other hypotheses about the origin and paleoposition of the Burma Terrane microplate exist,” Čerňanský said. “It is still rather controversial and leaves room for further interpretations regarding the origin of the animal lineages occurring there during the Cretaceous.” Photo: Joseph Bevitt/Edward Stanley/Andrej Čerňanský et al  Xantusiids, or night lizards, are thought to have diverged from cordyloformes, heavily armored lizards which first emerged in Africa, sometime during the Jurassic. If Rhetinosaurus is really is an ancestor of American xantusiids, or night lizards, that could mean they were crawling around more areas of what was once the supercontinent of Gondwana. There were parts of Myanmar still holding on to Gondwana then. Rhetinosaurus and related species could have survived for some 50 million years before the Burma Terrane plate drifted to Southeast Asia. Others which were left behind on Gondwana could have then crept over to North America. There is something else Rhetinosaurus could be telling us if it really is a proto-xantusiid. The left eye, which was better preserved, has eyelids but is missing the brille, a transparent layer that shields the eyes. Some reptiles with a brille have no eyelids at all. Čerňanský thinks it might imply that the brille in lizards — and possibly other reptiles — evolved after the protective bony plates and small scales around their eyes. “Rhetinosaurus shows evolution of these lineages in deep time,” he said. “Elsewhere in the world, a majority of terrestrial lizard fossils of similar age are represented by disarticulated and isolated elements. Burmese amber provides a unique window into the mid-Cretaceous world.”     ",Science/SYFY,An entire lizard trapped in amber is gazing back at us from 110 million years ago,https://news.yahoo.com/entire-lizard-trapped-amber-gazing-183601443.html
2/19/2022,"BRISBANE, Australia (AP) — The Australian Defense Department said that a Chinese navy ship fired a laser at one of its surveillance aircraft, putting the lives of the crew in danger. The incident happened on Thursday when the P-8A Poseidon plane detected a laser illuminating the aircraft while in flight over Australia's northern approaches, the department said. Such episodes are not uncommon as the U.S. and its allies accuse China of asserting its military might, and have taken steps to challenge Beijing's growing clout in the western Pacific and elsewhere. The department said in a statement Saturday that the laser came from a People’s Liberation Army Navy vessel. It was accompanying another Chinese ship that transited through the Torres Strait. Both ships were now in the Coral Sea, east of Australia, it said. “Illumination of the aircraft by the Chinese vessel is a serious safety incident,” the Defense Department said. “We strongly condemn unprofessional and unsafe military conduct. These actions could have endangered the safety and lives of the ADF personnel.” Lasers present a serious problem because when aimed at aircraft they can injure pilots or temporarily blind them -- which can present safety risks particularly as they are taking off and landing. Two years ago, the U.S. also accused the Chinese navy of firing a laser at one if its Poseidon planes over the Pacific. China denied it, saying the plane had circled at low altitude over its warship despite repeated warnings. In 2019, Australian navy helicopter pilots reported being were hit by lasers while exercising in the South China Sea, forcing them to land as a precaution. In 2018, the U.S. issued a formal complaint to the Chinese government over the use of high-grade lasers near the military base in Djibouti that were directed at aircraft and resulted in minor injuries to two American pilots. Tensions have ratcheted up particularly in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost in its entirety, while the U.S. and its allies insist on freedom of navigation and overflight in international waters.",World/Associated Press,Australia says China warship fired laser at its patrol plane,https://news.yahoo.com/australia-says-china-warship-fired-093254252.html
