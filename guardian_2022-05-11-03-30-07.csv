5/11/2022,"Electronic Arts has announced that it will cease making Fifa-branded football games next year. From 2023, the series will continue under a new brand, EA Sports FC. In a press release on the decision, EA stated that licensing deals remain in place with 19,000 players, 700 teams, and more than 30 leagues from around the world, as well as with UEFA, which means the Champions League will still be a part of the game, although the World Cup will not. The Fifa titles have been an annual fixture in game charts since the release of 1993’s Fifa International Soccer on the Sega Mega Drive. Since then the titles have sold more than 325m copies around the world, dominating the football simulation market and seeing off competitors such as Actua Soccer and Pro Evolution Soccer. The possibility of a split between Electronic Arts and Fifa was first reported by the New York Times last October when it was claimed that Fifa was looking to double its licensing fee to $1bn. Speaking to the BBC, David Jackson, vice president of EA Sports said that the publisher has plans to extend the game beyond interactive matches, but that the licensing restrictions imposed by Fifa were prohibitive. “At the moment, we engage in play as a primary form of interactive experience. Soon, watching and creating content are going to be equally as important for fans,” said Jackson. “Under the licensing conventions that we had agreed with Fifa 10 years ago, there were some restrictions that weren’t going to allow us to be able to build those experiences for players.” It’s likely that Electronic Arts will look to capitalise on the massive success of ‘live service’ games such as Fortnite and its own Apex Legends, where annual release schedules have been replaced by an evolving experience with seasonal subscription fees, live events and greater player customisation options. Watching live matches and esports competitions could also be part of the new series. Electronic Arts has attracted criticism for the ‘loot box’-style monetisation of its popular Ultimate Team mode, in which fans pay for randomised digital packets of players with which to build their own superstar sides. In 2018, Belgian effectively banned loot box mechanics in games when they were classified as unregulated gambling. Governments around the world have since looked into tightening regulations. EA has not yet shared details on its plan for monetising future football games, but industry watchers will be interested to see if it rolls back on its profitable Ultimate Team model. Fans will also await more solid information on EA’s promises to introduce fresh modes and innovate in new areas such as the women’s game and grassroots football.",Arts/Games,Electronic Arts ditches Fifa for future football games,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/may/10/electronic-arts-ditches-fifa-ea-sports-fc
5/11/2022,"A Republican US senator called local police to investigate a pro-abortion rights – but otherwise harmless – message written in chalk in front of her home, according to authorities. The Maine senator Susan Collins called officers last Saturday evening to complain about an anonymous message written in chalk on a sidewalk just outside her residence in Bangor that asked her to support abortion rights legislation, according to a police report that was obtained by the Guardian. The chalk art, described in the police report as “intricately drawn” and non-threatening, read: “Susie, please, Mainers want WHPA —–> vote yes, clean up your mess.” WHPA refers to the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would codify abortion rights. In the report, police wrote that they did not notice anything suspicious around Collins’s residence. They also said that the chalk message did not constitute a crime. A Bangor public works department employee later went to Collins’s home to wash off the chalk message. The senator provided a statement to the Bangor Daily News, which first reported on the chalk message, saying, “We are grateful to the Bangor police officers and the city public works employee who responded to the defacement of public property in front of our home.” With last week’s leak of a draft opinion showing that the US supreme court is poised to overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 landmark decision which legalized abortion, Collins has faced criticism from voters for helping block the advancement of the WHPA to the Senate floor for debate in February. The Senate plans to again vote on potentially advancing the WHPA this Wednesday. Collins has signaled she plans to again oppose the WHPA, which would need 60 votes to advance, a threshold that most doubt the bill will clear. She, along with Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a fellow Republican, has introduced a different bill that would codify abortion rights while still allowing individual states to roll back protections. Collins has also been criticized for backing the confirmation of the supreme court justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who form part of the court’s conservative majority that supports overturning Roe v Wade, according to the leaked draft opinion. After the leak, Collins sought to distance herself from Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, issuing a statement decrying the two justices as being “completely inconsistent” with what they said during their confirmation hearings or in conversations with her. Collins suggested both had indicated they would not support overturning Roe v Wade. “If this leaked draft opinion is the final decision … it would be completely inconsistent with what Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office,” Collins’ statement said.",News/US news,Susan Collins calls the cops over polite abortion message chalked outside home,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/10/susan-collins-chalk-message-abortion-police
5/11/2022,"Elon Musk has said he will reverse Twitter’s ban on the former US president Donald Trump if the Tesla boss completes a takeover of the social media platform. Twitter permanently banned Trump in January 2021, citing repeated violations of company rules and its judgment that his tweets were “highly likely to encourage and inspire people to replicate the criminal acts that took place at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021”, referring to the attack on the building by his supporters. Musk, the world’s richest man because of his stake in the electric car company Tesla, revealed his initial stake in New York-listed Twitter on 4 April, and agreed a $44bn (£36bn) deal on 25 April after several weeks of rapid negotiations. “I would reverse the permanent ban,” Musk said on Tuesday, speaking via video link at a car industry conference organised by the Financial Times. “I do think it was not correct to ban Donald Trump,” he said. “I think that was a mistake. It alienated the country and did not result in Donald Trump not having a voice. “I think it was a morally bad decision and foolish in the extreme.” Trump has stated publicly that he would not return to Twitter even if he were allowed to, preferring instead the Truth Social network founded under his name. However, many of Trump’s political opponents believe he would be unlikely to pass up the opportunity to broadcast to Twitter’s much larger audience. A return would potentially give Trump a larger platform to influence the next US presidential election in 2024, either as a candidate or as a kingmaker among Republican candidates. Musk also reiterated criticisms that Twitter’s staff are too leftwing, saying they were influenced by being headquartered in San Francisco, regarded as one of the most liberal cities in the US and known for electing Democrat and progressive candidates. Twitter is “coming out of an environment that is very far left”, he said. “Twitter needs to be much more even-handed,” he said. “It’s currently left-biased.” He also said the Twitter takeover would be completed in a “best-case scenario” only within the next two or three months. “It is for me not a done deal,” he said.",News/Technology,Elon Musk pledges to overturn Twitter’s ban on Donald Trump,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/10/elon-musk-pledges-overturn-twitter-ban-donald-trump
5/11/2022,"Anytime a sporting event bills itself as “the Super Bowl of” its kind, the pressure to pay that off will be immense. But in terms of spectacle Formula 1’s inaugural Miami Grand Prix more than lived up to the outsized billing. The fake marina, the poolside mermaids and other kitschy touches were a hit. People from all races and cultures turned up in droves, dressed to kill. Female fans trooped out in force. The sun was out, the vibe was Instagram ready and there was nary a confederate flag in sight. Nascar, eat your heart out. By the time Gabrielle Union, David Beckham, Kathryn Hahn and Mila Kunis rolled through the Miami Gardens paddock last Sunday for what some were calling MotorCoachella, the crowd had swelled to around 85,000; a staggering number of them were adorned in the latest fashions from Ferrari, Aston Martin and Williams. In the end they got their considerable money’s worth. It hardly mattered that the race itself was big, fat dud. Face it: besides the championship games involving Tom Brady – who was on hand for Sunday’s GP, too – most modern day Super Bowls have been yawn-inducing one-sided affairs. Sunday’s title fight between pole sitter Charles Leclerc and defending champion Max Verstappen was no different. Naturally, it appeared early on as if this main event would make for a much closer clash in styles, with Ferrari’s cornering prowess pitted against Red Bull’s straight-ahead speed. But once they got rolling Verstappen quickly leapfrogged Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz and reeled in Leclerc on the way to opening up a massive lead. If not for a lap 41 caution, Verstappen might’ve authored the worst Miami Super Bowl drubbing since the 49ers ran roughshod over the Chargers in 1995. Verstappen, who arrived at the podium under police escort, taking a Dolphins football helmet from Dan Marino was a nice touch. But after that beating? His rivals probably needed the protection more. The blowout wasn’t a turnoff at home, either. ABC’s coverage of the race drew 2.6 million viewers in the US, the most ever for a live F1 telecast – a slightly smaller audience than the one that tuned in for Sunday’s Nascar race. And that was with NBA analyst Jeff Van Gundy enthusiastically and somewhat randomly going on a long tangent about the race during ABC’s preceding coverage of the Grizzlies-Warriors playoff series. Even more impressive than Verstappen’s blistering result is that he achieved it on a makeshift, hybrid circuit that would come under withering criticism over the weekend for its crumbling hairpin, cramped chicane and overall lack of grip made worse by a near triple-digit heat wave. Twice, the track was resurfaced ahead of Sunday’s race. Fernando Alonso effectively called the surface atop this gussied-up parking lot – an alloy of Georgia granite, local limestone and 24,000 tons of asphalt – substandard. Red Bull’s Sergio Perez called it “a joke.” Lando Norris, who crashed out of the race after a late scrap with Pierre Gasly through a dodgy patch of asphalt in turn 7, accused Miami’s circuit designers of “winging it.” “There’s been only one line that has the grip,” said Valtteri Bottas, who smashed up his Alfa Romeo entering turn 7 during Friday practice. “That makes it a bit more tricky for overtaking.” Verstappen, who nearly crashed out of practice while barreling through the chicane and slipped up again while qualifying third, said the grip off the racing line “almost feels like gravel.” Even more jarring was Alpine’s Esteban Ocon totalling his car while spinning out of the chicane entry and into a fully concrete barrier. (Later, Ocon slammed the lack of protection on that barrier as “unacceptable.”) Also during Friday practice Sainz wiped out into another unprotected concrete wall outside of turn 14 that had Ferrari scrambling to pick up the pieces in time for the next day’s qualifying session. It wouldn’t be a Super Bowl if there wasn’t a little bit of controversy in the aftermath. (What’s more, it’s a somewhat refreshing change of tone from all the previous weeks’ chatter about porpoising.) But not every driver was down on the Miami experience. Lewis Hamilton had likened the Miami circuit to the big-box store car parks where he used to race karts with his father but refused to condemn the track on Sunday after the race. (Although Hamilton did take slight exception to the circuit’s bumps early on…) And of course Daniel Ricciardo is always upbeat. Even though the Australian wasn’t especially thrilled about finishing 13th, Ricciardo could still take stock of how far and fast F1 has come. Seven years ago, in the run-up to a dismal US Grand Prix in Austin that was just about washed out by torrential rains, Ricciardo was asked what F1 needed to do to hook more American fans and his answer – be “more lads-y” – couldn’t have been more ironic. And when I caught up with him late on Sunday in the paddock as he dodged a mob of celebrities and selfie seekers – most of them here because of what petrolheads might describe as a frothy soap opera – well, I wondered if he could see the irony now. “I remember saying that, yeah,” he said. “I never really thought it would get to this point in such little time. The sport’s really getting into pop culture. “I feel like everyone here today, or at least the people that I met were here because they love the sport. It’s not for them to get their picture on social media or to be on TV. There’s a lot of popular people who are really showing an interest. We had Josh Allen here, quarterback of the Bills, and he’s obsessed with the sport at the moment. The Watt boys were here. It makes me happy that the sport’s gone the way it’s gone.” The Miami circuit may have been a letdown, sure, but organisers will have nine more cracks to sort it out. What’s important is that this much-hyped Shula steak matched the sizzle. As a Super Bowl-level event the Miami Grand Prix more than made the grade. It left no doubt that F1’s American expansion strategy is definitely on the right track.

5/11/2022,"Tesco chairman John Allan, aside from calling for a windfall tax on North Sea oil and producers, also said this on Tuesday: “I think they [the companies’ boards] are expecting it and I doubt they would actually be much fazed by it.” Since Allan is a well-connected FTSE 100 boardroom heavyweight, it’s safe to assume he’s correct on the first point. And one strongly suspects he’s right on the second, too: most versions of a windfall tax do not involve sums that should scare directors or shareholders. The Labour party’s formula imagines a temporary increase in the rate of tax on North Sea profits from 40% to 50% to capture the “windfall” element generated by the spike in wholesale gas and oil prices. As noted here last week, BP says it already anticipates paying up to £1bn in tax on its North Sea profits this year, so a windfall surcharge on top would only raise a further £250m in its case. A sum that size – levied as a genuine one-off – would not cause a meltdown at a company with a stock market value of £79bn that expects to distribute £8bn to shareholders this year via dividends and share buy-backs. The BP chief executive, Bernard Looney, has already conceded that £18bn-worth of planned investment in the UK over the next decade would not be imperilled. Allan’s “not much fazed” conclusion sounds fair. The flip-side of a modest revenue-raising proposal is, of course, the modesty of its impact in relieving the cost of energy for consumers, even if directed exclusively at low-income households. Labour mentioned as little as £1.2bn overall when pitching its windfall idea in January. The further surge in wholesale prices might inflate the figure to £3bn-ish under the same formula, but that has to be seen in the context of additional energy costs for UK consumers this year, which will be north of £20bn in total on plausible estimates. Allan’s intervention, on a day British Gas-owner Centrica unveiled a profits upgrade thanks to strong returns from its North Sea gas fields and nuclear assets, may help to inject a note of realism into this debate. Boards are pragmatic: if windfall taxes are seen to apply only in exceptional circumstances, they are not going to rip up long-term investment plans. Equally, a windfall tax does not offer salvation. From the point of view of the Treasury and consumers, it’s a case of every little helps, as a chairman of Tesco could have put it. But, yes, as Allan did say, the argument in favour is starting to look “overwhelming”. The Arga saga still smoulders Here is the first recommendation of Sir John Kingman’s review of the Financial Reporting Council, the audit watchdog, published in December 2018: “The FRC should be replaced as soon as possible with a new independent regulator with clear statutory powers and objectives.” Note the “as soon as possible” imperative. Kingman’s report was prompted by the chaotic failure of construction giant Carillion that year, a shocking example of a large and important company collapsing like a house of cards despite receiving a clean bill of financial health. Reform was deemed urgent because stakeholders in many guises – shareholders, employees, government, suppliers – needed greater confidence in the quality of corporate reporting in the UK. Kingman’s report was widely hailed as setting the right direction. The FRC was too toothless for the modern world. A new body with extra powers to police audit standards and competition, to be called the Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority (Arga), was needed. Two further inquires agreed, a white paper followed and the FRC got busy preparing itself for reinvention as Arga. It is still waiting. Tuesday’s Queen’s Speech relegated audit reform to the status of draft bill, as opposed to a definitely-will-happen-in-this-parliament bill. More foot-dragging is indefensible. It is true that the FRC has acquired more teeth in the last couple of years, but only an act of parliament can deliver many of the necessary reforms, such as statutory funding for the new body and powers to put large private companies (think BHS) under the audit microscope. One can’t blame Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, who seems to be keen to get the show rolling. But one can note that he is the fourth holder of his post since Kingman’s report landed, which illustrates how long the Arga saga has been running. The excuse this time, it is said, is that audit reform doesn’t excite voters in the way that, say, the creation of a football regulator does. That excuse is feeble.",News/Business,A North Sea oil windfall tax won’t raise much but every little bit helps,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/may/10/a-north-sea-oil-windfall-tax-wont-raise-much-but-every-little-bit-helps
5/11/2022,"A controversial law that could force publishers to pay the costs of the people who sue them, even if they win, is to be repealed, the government has announced. Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013, which was drawn up following the Leveson inquiry, poses “a threat to the freedom and sustainability of the press”, the government said on Monday. The provision, which was supported by celebrities such as Gary Lineker and Hugh Grant and the campaign group Hacked Off, had never been brought into force. The Guardian previously joined all other national newspaper groups in objecting to section 40, arguing that it was “not fit for purpose” and would hurt the sort of investigative journalism which produced its own reporting on the Panama Papers, as well that which uncovered the phone-hacking scandal which prompted the Leveson inquiry. In 2017, the Guardian said: “This is of no benefit to the public, as it will discourage newspapers from conducting difficult investigations and holding powerful people to account.” It added: “In complex and controversial cases such as terrorism, national security, or where deep source protection sits at the heart of a story, this chilling is likely to be particularly profound.” The Financial Times had argued that by keeping the law on the statute book but not in force it appeared to give ministers “unacceptable leverage with regard to the newspaper industry” and was “a legislative sword of Damocles”. Section 40 could require publishers to pay the costs of the people who sue them, even if they win, unless they are signed up to a state-backed regulator. No major publisher supports such a regulator. Some national newspapers are members of the Independent Press Standards Organisation, which is not state-sanctioned, while the Guardian is self-regulated. The only state-recognised press regulator is Impress, although most of its members are small or hyperlocal publications. Nathan Sparkes, chief executive of Hacked Off, said: “Section 40 was designed to shield regulated newspapers from costly lawsuits brought by the rich and the powerful, it is the only way to guarantee the freedom and accountability of the press, and it would put an end to wealthy oligarchs seeking to silence critical reporting with meritless legal claims.”",News/Media,Section 40: government to repeal controversial media law ,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/10/section-40-government-to-repeal-controversial-media-law
5/11/2022,"Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching Better Call Saul season six, which airs on Netflix in the UK. Do not read on unless you have watched episodes one to five. So, Lalo has turned up! The waiting was becoming too much. In each of the opening scenes, the audience and the characters expected him to appear from around a corner at any minute. Kim unable to sleep at night and propping chairs behind the door; Gus having panic attacks (or premonitions?) while serving signature spice curls. But Lalo is not in New Mexico. He is in Germany, looking a little tousled and with murder not even uppermost on his mind. He wants evidence of what Werner Ziegler and “his boys” were up to underneath the Lavandería Brillante. The best way to do that, he has decided, is through Werner’s widow. Lalo as a winsome shoulder to cry on is a new one, and it doesn’t require a Fring mindset to imagine the possibility that, at any minute, he might suddenly stop the urbane conversation and kill the poor woman. But he doesn’t, walking the widow home and bidding her adieu, having made a mental note to come back the next day and rob her house while she is at work. Of course, he very nearly does kill Margarethe during his burglary, being forced to screw on his silencer when she forgets her phone. But as she begins to suspect something and starts creeping towards an inevitable fate, Lalo finds a way out of his predicament, seizing a preserved ruler and getting away through a narrow window. So our big bad guy is back and as determined as ever, but some delaying of gratification is still part of the Lalo storyline. It’s a great endorsement of the man, and the dedication he has to revenge on Gus, that he is willing to put off extracting his satisfaction in order to build a watertight case. I’m imagining he has never travelled to Germany before, so the change of scenery must have been nice. In another scene that I expected to include Lalo attacking with a submachine gun, Saul Goodman makes a late-night in-person consultation visit to a client that “sounds like money”. But instead of the cartel, it is Jimmy’s rival and recent fall guy who awaits him. Howard had sussed out the scheme to defame him, and in quite short order too, booking a boxing gym to get his revenge – a thoroughly consensual bout of pugilism with headguards and a referee. After jiggling his leg up and down during a Sandpiper presentation (one he ends up saving with some Wolf of Wall Street wizardry), Howard is confronted by Clifford Main, who has not one, not two, but three clues that suggest the HHM man is off the rails. Howard denies all charges strongly, and points out how conspicuously timed all these information dumps have been. He asks who Clifford had been meeting during the Jaguar scene, and when the answer comes – “Kim Wexler” – he has Jimmy’s name in his mouth immediately. And so, to a fight, which Jimmy unexpectedly agrees to take part in. They have both fought before it turns out; they know their way around the ring and each land some meaty body shots. Jimmy quickly tires however and soon enough Howard has him knocked him to the floor with an uppercut. “I’d like to think that this ends it,” says Howard, “Probably not.” And to prove a point he leaves the gym and sics a detective on Jimmy’s tail. Why did Lalo take the ruler? After another head-scratcher of a start, the object we see being made in the opening scene turns out to be a thank-you gift to Werner from his crewmates. I don’t remember seeing the ruler before, but it definitely looks like something Werner might have had on him, and kept from the beginning of his career. I’m also not quite sure what Lalo is going to do with it next. My guess is that the label on the bottom of the preserved ruler shows the lab that manufactured it and Lalo will go there to find the addresses of the people who asked for it to be made. From there, he’ll find Kai or Casper and extract a confession. Lalo has been on the scent of the superlab ever since he started tracking Gus and has found out enough titbits about it to likely convince him it’s real. Evidence of a rival lab would prove the rumours of someone undercutting the cartel to be true and would guarantee Gus’s death. It’s perhaps the power of that fact as much as anything that has the Chicken Man so worried, and is the reason he stashes his ankle gun in the wheel of a JCB at the bottom of the superlab dig. Gus knows Lalo is alive and he knows he knows about the lab, too. He’s had another premonition and made a bet that the denouement of their rivalry will happen in the place that was made possible by Werner’s passion for measurement. Kudos for the smooth way Mike rolls out of the boot he was hiding in to get access to Gus’s second house. It was like a choreographed move in a music video. Everyone’s lives are complicated, but Kim has the right to linger thoughtfully over her coffee as she is confronted with the reality of her work with society’s forgotten members and being an inspiration to a career-minded former colleague , while she is trying – and succeeding – at squeezing said former colleague into coughing up details of the judge overseeing Sandpiper. Jimmy rehires Francesca Liddy, a relationship that will go on to last for six years, innumerable cases and a final shredding of documents. She also appears to be responsible for some of the decor, perhaps the constitution mural on the wall …",Arts/Television & radio,"Better Call Saul recap: season six, episode five – Jimmy’s fists do the talking",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/10/better-call-saul-recap-season-six-episode-five-jimmys-fists-do-the-talking
5/11/2022,"Two decades ago, photographs of blue burqas became perhaps the totemic image of life under the Taliban, as Afghan women’s rights were invoked and exploited to justify the country’s invasion. On Saturday, the Taliban once more ordered women to cover their faces in public. While Afghan women have courageously protested against the injunction, the reaction internationally has this time been muted. That it follows other punitive restrictions creating what some have called “gender apartheid” – preventing teenage girls from studying and women from working outside healthcare or education, or travelling outside their home town without a male guardian – makes it all the more appalling. Ukraine is absorbing the world’s attention. But the muffled response surely also reflects the wish of the US, the UK and others to put the failure of the last 20 years behind them, and the fact that behind the rhetoric, women’s rights remain a low priority. Though the Taliban justify the burqa as a matter of tradition, this has only been the case in the most conservative rural areas. For many Afghan women, this is a wholly alien and unwelcome imposition. Yet, equally, their greatest concern may not be the edict to cover their faces per se, but the fact that this is the latest blow removing their ability to work, earn, or be present in the public sphere, and handing control of their bodies to the men in their families. Authorities also suggested that women should not leave their homes if possible, emboldening enforcers on the ground. Women cannot even decide independently what risks they are willing to take, since if their faces are seen in public their male “guardians” face fines, jail time and losing their jobs. (Women who work for the government will also be fired.) The growing repression demolishes Taliban claims to have changed since they last ruled Afghanistan. Even when they swept to power last August, some outsiders entertained the idea that this was a more moderate “Taliban 2.0”, given the promises to protect the rights of women and not seek retribution. The last-minute reversal of a promise to allow secondary education to resume for girls across the country highlighted internal divisions. Some clerics sympathetic to the militants have called for older girls to be allowed back to school, and in some areas they are already studying. But all the evidence is that the power of hardliners is becoming entrenched. At stake is not only women’s freedom, but also the survival of families amid economic collapse. While the Taliban increase their repression, they show little interest in or ability to tackle the immense humanitarian catastrophe. People are starving. In March, the World Bank halted $600m-worth of development projects, saying women’s rights were not being respected. UN Women says that restrictions on female employment have cost up to $1bn, or 5% of output. Other countries have limited scope for action, but must clearly and consistently reiterate their support for women’s rights as a necessity and priority for Afghan women themselves. They should not send all-male delegations to meet the leadership. And they should consider how funding can offer leverage: paying for education where teenage girls can attend school, for example, may help to generate pressure in neighbouring communities. Afghan women will not be “saved”, in the narrative once propagated by western leaders. But nor must they be abandoned. They must be heard, and given every element of support that can be mustered.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Afghan women: the Taliban turn the screws | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/10/the-guardian-view-on-afghan-women-the-taliban-turn-the-screws
5/11/2022,"The podcaster Deborah James has said she “cannot thank people enough” after a fundraiser for cancer research raised over £1.5m since she announced she had been moved to hospice at home care. In a post on Monday, James, who has terminal bowel cancer, told followers on social media that she did not know “how long I’ve got left”. The presenter of the BBC podcast You, Me and the Big C said the last six months had been “heartbreaking” to go through, but that she had been surrounded by “so much love” and had “no regrets”. The former deputy headteacher said she was setting up the Bowelbabe Fund, and shared links to charities including Cancer Research UK, Bowel Cancer UK and the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity. The JustGiving page had raised more than £1,550,000 by 6.30pm on Tuesday evening. She told BBC Breakfast, in an interview due to be broadcast on Wednesday, that she feels “utterly loved” by the generosity. She said: “I had a figure in my mind of about a quarter of a million, because I thought that would be enough to fund a good couple of projects across the charities that I wanted to fund. “But in 24 hours to do a million, I’m like absolutely mind blown and I just cannot thank people enough for their generosity. It just means so much to me. It makes me feel utterly loved.” James was diagnosed with the condition in 2016 and since then has kept her nearly 300,000 Instagram followers up to date with her treatments, progress and diagnosis. On 14 December 2021, she marked five years since her diagnosis, writing on Instagram: “I’m fully aware I shouldn’t be alive to write this today.” But in her latest post, she said: “The message I never wanted to write. We have tried everything, but my body simply isn’t playing ball. “My active care has stopped and I am now moved to hospice at home care, with my incredible family all around me and the focus is on making sure I’m not in pain and spending time with them.” The post continued: “Nobody knows how long I’ve got left but I’m not able to walk, I’m sleeping most of the days, and most things I took for granted are pipe dreams.” James added that she had left “no stone unturned” in search of treatment, but that even a “magic new breakthrough” would not make a difference. She wrote: “All I ask, if you ever read a column, followed my Instagram, listened to the podcast or saw me dressed as a poo for no reason, please buy me a drink to see me out this world, by donating the cost to @bowelbabefund which will enable us to raise funds for further lifesaving research into cancer. To give more Deborahs more time!” She added: “Right now for me it’s all about taking it a day at a time, step by step and being grateful for another sunrise.

5/11/2022,"The bitter feud would almost be comical were it not being waged in the devastated Ukrainian town of Borodyanka, north of Kyiv, among hollowed out buildings, burned armoured vehicles and freshly dug graves. A near two-decade grudge between two priests, fuelled by fierce interchurch tensions and the pursuit of local dominance, has escalated into tit-for-tat claims of attempted murder, treachery, collaboration in forced deportations and vigilante vandalism. An uncomfortable introduction as younger men 18 years ago, and a few awkward moments at local community events, have spiralled, local people say, into each threatening God’s judgment on the other. The chief accuser of the two is Father Dmytro Koshka, rector at the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin, of the Orthodox church of Ukraine. It is not to be confused with the Moscow-affiliated Ukrainian Orthodox church, for which the accused, Father Viktor Talko, is an archpriest. Koshka, 42, sitting in the shade of his church’s porch as a line of local people waited to be handed spare clothes, food and water by volunteers, said he believed Talko, 67, at the Church of Archangel Michael, a short drive down Lesi Ukrainky boulevard, had directed Russian soldiers to hunt him down at the height of their occupation on 2 March. “I received a call from the territorial defence fighters because I am also a member of the Borodyanka territorial defence,” Koshka said. “They said they were asking me to leave my house because the Moscow father had received Russian soldiers and cooperated with them.” Koshka said he left the next day for the sake of his wife, Mariya, 41, and daughter, Angelina, 18, for Piskivka, a village 15 miles north-west of Borodyanka. “The territorial defence told me that when Russian soldiers came to the church to look for me, they showed everyone all my personal data, even my passport data. They had all the information about me,” he said. “I used to be a deputy of the city council. And this is access to public information about me. But Russian soldiers, they would never have found it themselves, they were helped by the Russian priest. He gave them all this information … I know him very well.” Koshka, who did not offer any evidence for his claims, went on: “He gave [the Russian soldiers] shelter in his church. He then stationed their military equipment on his farm. His own son helped to do it. After that, he prepared food for them, fed them, they spent the night there. In short, he met them as his close friends. Everyone knows about it and everyone has seen it.” The gravest crime, Koshka said, however, was that Talko allowed his church to be part of a “trick” on people desperate to escape the shelling in the town. Local people received a text message from an anonymous number inviting them to meet at Talko’s church to be evacuated – but they had not been told that their destination was Russia-allied Belarus, it is claimed. “The SBU [Ukrainian secret services] is dealing with him because he helped to smuggle people to Belarus, more than 100 people,” Koshka said. “They had tried to escape. He, his son, his family got into a minibus and started running. But one bridge was blown up, another bridge was blown up and in third place was the Ukrainian army. And they were trapped, they had nowhere to run.” Talko was, he added, not a priest but a “wolf in sheep’s clothing”. A five minute drive away, Talko, sitting among the cherry trees and blackberry bushes in the pretty grounds of his own church, angrily denied most of the claims and all of Koshka’s interpretation of the events during the Russian occupation, calling his fellow priest “spiritually ill” and saying he was seeking to stir up enmity. Talko said he was being unfairly accused of being an agent of the Russian army owing to the historical links between his denomination and Moscow, shaking his head as he spoke. He denied running away, saying he was picked up by the Ukrainian secret services on 2 April, the day after Russian forces left, and interrogated for six days in a gymnasium in Kyiv. Talko said he had only ever tried to help local people by asking for flour from the Russians and denied giving the invaders information about Koshka. “I have no problems with the Ukrainian government,” said Talko, who has led his church in Borodyanka for 30 years. “They accuse me of allegedly collaborating with the Russian occupation forces. Everything I did as a priest, as a clergyman. I turned to Russian soldiers only for help for Ukrainian civilians. “I did not feed Russian soldiers either. We fed ordinary civilians. We asked for flour from Russian soldiers to bake bread for people in our church. And the Ukrainian authorities cannot understand how this is so – the enemy helped the Ukrainian priest. Ukrainian authorities now portray Russian soldiers as terrible. But in reality, the Russian soldiers here were different.” Grasping what he said was a letter of thanks from a Borodyanka family who had since moved and were uncontactable, Talko said people had been grateful for his help in getting them to Belarus. “Please see what letter people wrote to me whom I helped to evacuate to Belarus,” he said. “They are grateful to me for that. We helped evacuate our Ukrainian people through the Belarusian Red Cross. We asked for the Belarusian Red Cross and they evacuated people to Belarus. “Our church helped evacuate 80 people to Belarus. And we also helped evacuate people to western Ukraine. We helped evacuate 1,500 people to western Ukraine.” Koshka’s church had been formed merely to challenge his own, Talko said, adding that he believed Koshka had encouraged people to throw molotov cocktails into an outhouse by the gates to his church’s estate. “Here you see a burnt building near the church?”, he asked. “It was all organised by this priest. He is now a ‘star and a patriot’. God bless him.” Hd added: “The first time we met, he approached me with such a strange expression on his face. I told him – never get in my way again. If I was not a priest I would be talking to him differently now. I used to wrestle and do sports. Let God judge him.”",News/World news,Ukrainian priests pursue unholy row in burned-out Borodyanka,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/ukrainian-priests-pursue-unholy-row-in-burned-out-borodyanka
5/11/2022,"Natalie Bassingthwaighte’s latest TV project is, by her own description, a “heartwarming experiment”. The new ABC series Space 22, which screens Tuesdays at 8pm from 17 May, follows seven strangers who take part in an experiment to see if increased creativity can help their mental health. “People come in and they’re very vulnerable,” host Bassingthwaighte says. “It’s really impactful and powerful and to be honest, it’s one of the best things I’ve ever done.” And Bassingthwaighte has done a lot. Over the past two decades she has fronted the band Rogue Traders, launched a solo music career, and played the role of Izzy Hoyland on Neighbours. Despite her years on stage, Bassingthwaighte didn’t grow up in a musical household – or so she thought. It wasn’t until she unearthed an old keyboard from her parent’s home that she learned her dad had once played music. Here, she tells us why she’d rush to save that “crusty” old instrument in a fire, as well as the story of two other important personal belongings. After I left high school I went back home and cleared out some things from underneath the house. I found this old keyboard – it was super retro. It’s called a Mustang. It was my dad’s, but I didn’t know until then that he used to play. He’d never once mentioned that he’d ever played piano or that he was musical. Dad turned 70 this year and he got it for his 21st, so it’s exciting to have had it for this long. I’m thinking of getting it all revamped so it can actually work, because it sounds horrific at the moment. It’s pretty old and crusty but it’d be amazing to get it going again. When I did the show Who Do You Think You Are? I found out that my three times great-grandmother married a guy who was a comedian and a performer when she came out to Australia. They travelled around the country with their nine children in a band called The E Street Family. Between that and my dad, there’s been this slow process of figuring out there was an actual thread to why I do what I do. A tiny little steamer that I carry with me wherever I go. It’s called an Esteam and it’s so portable that I can just chuck it into my suitcase. I have a lot of delicate clothes, stuff that really needs to be steamed and not ironed, so it’s a game changer. But one word of warning: never steam your clothes while they’re on you. I’ve done it twice. The second time I thought, “Oh, surely I won’t burn myself again.” I burned myself again. Twelve years ago my husband and I were trying for a baby and waiting to find out whether we were pregnant. I did a couple of tests that came back negative. Then all of a sudden, it was New Year’s Eve and I was performing at Crown Casino. All my friends came down for the show; we got the penthouse to stay in overnight and it was going to be a really big party. And that morning, I woke up, did a test and found I was pregnant. Obviously I was excited. But then I was devastated because we were about to have this big party in the penthouse! So I did the show, we went up to the penthouse, they all had a party and I went to bed early. I got up the next morning, went to Versace and I bought myself the nicest, most expensive jacket that I’ve ever owned as a consolation prize for missing the fun. I still have it to this day, but I’ve lost a button from the jacket that you cannot get replaced – like, it just doesn’t exist. Those Versace buttons aren’t made anymore. It’s a good story and a good jacket, but forever missing a button.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Three things with Natalie Bassingthwaighte: ‘I thought oh, surely I won’t burn myself again’",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/11/three-things-with-natalie-bassingthwaighte-i-thought-oh-surely-i-wont-burn-myself-again
5/11/2022,"Employers have warned against “unaffordable” wage increases after Anthony Albanese backed a 5.1% minimum wage rise to keep up with inflation. Despite the warnings, the Australian Industry Group has raised its own submission to the Fair Work Commission from 2% to 2.5%, while the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has asked for low paid workers to get a 3% rise. Labour economists have countered that holding wages down now to prevent future inflation amounts to punishing workers with real pay cuts for inflation they didn’t cause. With inflation tipped to reach 6% by the end of the year, the Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary, Sally McManus, has defended its bid for a 5.5% increase as “incredibly reasonable”. Cost-of-living pressures and wage stagnation have emerged as the most important issues for voters ahead of the 21 May election, with runaway inflation already triggering a mid-campaign interest rate rise. On Monday Albanese declined to back the unions’ call but “absolutely” backed a 5.1% increase to keep up with the cost of living. The Ai Group urged the Fair Work Commission to adopt a “cautious approach in adjusting wages”, warning “an excessive minimum wage increase would fuel inflation and lead to higher interest rates on mortgages, personal loans and credit cards than would otherwise be the case”. “Higher inflation and higher interest rates would have a particularly harsh impact on the low paid,” Ai Group’s chief executive, Innes Willox, said. Employers argue the commission must take into account that superannuation is set to increase by 0.5% in July and that the low and middle income tax offset is worth 1.3% in pre-tax income to an employee on the minimum wage. Willox argued that increases of more than 5% were “unsustainable” and there was a “strong precedent” in previous decisions to consider superannuation and tax cuts. “In the current circumstances, there is a clear risk that a high increase in wages without improved workplace productivity would fuel inflation and increase the likelihood of a steeper rise in interest rates to the detriment of growth and job creation. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “An increase in the minimum wages as demanded by unions would have adverse impacts on the economy, on unemployment, on underemployment and on sentiment, and would be a setback for many low-income households.” Andrew McKellar, the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said that “imposing unaffordable wage increases on small business will cruel jobs, not create them”. “Any increase of 5% or more would inflict further pain on small business, and the millions of jobs they sustain and create. Small business cannot afford it.” Jim Stanford, the director of the Centre for Future Work, told Guardian Australia that “wages didn’t cause the current inflation”, which he blamed on “supply chains, the oil price spike, and an initial surge in post-pandemic spending”. “Telling workers they need to just swallow a permanent reduction in earnings, as a result of inflation they didn’t cause, in order to prevent future inflation, is neither fair nor economically justified,” he said. Stanford is a co-author of a report titled The Wages Crisis: Revisited that finds that since 2013, nominal wages have become locked into a trajectory of about 2% growth a year, about half the rate of before 2013. Scott Morrison has argued during the election campaign that there is no “magic pen” that can drive wages higher, and only low unemployment can do that. But the report, also co-authored by professor Andrew Stewart and associate professor Tess Hardy, finds there is no systematic relationship between wage growth and labour demand and that Australia has had among the weakest wage growth in the OECD despite stronger macro conditions. Stanford labelled the Reserve Bank’s claim that it has seen “early signs” of wage rises as “wishful thinking”. “Even the RBA sees real wages declining for another two years – not something that should happen if wages were truly reflecting a tight supply-and-demand balance,” he said. The study blames poor wages growth on factors including the minimum wage falling behind median wages, pay caps on public sector pay, erosion of collective bargaining, underfunding public services like aged care, and wage theft.",News/Australia news,Industry warns ’small business can’t afford it’ after Albanese backs 5.1% minimum wage rise,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/11/industry-warns-small-business-cant-afford-it-after-albanese-backs-51-minimum-wage-rise
5/11/2022,"The Queensland government will on Wednesday announce the terms of reference for a four-month commission of inquiry into how the Queensland police service handles domestic violence. For leading academics, women’s advocates and domestic violence victims, the inquiry has been a long time coming. “It’s great news. Finally!” said Julie*, whose address was accessed by a police officer and sent to her violent former partner. “But the details are important,” she said. “They’ve got one chance to get this right. I’ll reserve judgment until I’ve seen who is running it and if they’re going to look at the real issues.” An inquiry into “widespread cultural issues” within the police service was a key recommendation of the Queensland women’s safety and justice taskforce, chaired by former court of appeal president Margaret McMurdo. The taskforce found that women seeking protection from police enter “a raffle”. Some get excellent assistance, but others are turned away. Over the years, reports and inquests have focused on police practices – things like training and procedures that can be easily reformed. Changes have been made. Women continue to be failed. The McMurdo report’s most controversial – and some say critical – recommendation was to call for an inquiry into police culture. It acknowledged what experts have said consistently for years – that officer attitudes and masculine police culture contribute to poor responses. The police union that represents most rank and file officers has previously made claims – disputed by experts – that domestic violence accusations are used to gain advantage in family court proceedings. In response to criticism, a union official called leading women’s groups “the DV industry”. The union president, Ian Leavers, called the landmark McMurdo report “just another woke report to slam police at every opportunity.” Opposition to an inquiry from the union and the Queensland police service – which now says it will “cooperate fully” with the process – has previously put pressure on the government kill the recommendation. The decision to go ahead is politically brave. But only if the inquiry ultimately reflects McMurdo’s recommendation that it focus on “police culture”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning On Tuesday, when the state government announced it would implement all 89 of the taskforce recommendations, it said in a statement that the inquiry would look into “police practices”. The word “culture” was not mentioned. The distinction is subtle, but critical. Some advocates are worried that it might ultimately offer a watered-down version of the work that is truly needed. “The important thing is that it has to look into police culture,” said Kerry Carrington, a leading domestic violence expert and an adjunct Prof at the University of the Sunshine Coast. Queensland is now on a path to criminalising coercive control, something that has been controversial among experts, and opposed by some First Nations women who say police responses to their circumstances are particularly problematic. McMurdo also recommended the inquiry should examine the impact on the overrepresentation of First Nations peoples in the criminal justice system. “At a minimum, the commission of inquiry should have terms of reference wide enough to also consider recruitment, promotion, resource allocation, performance monitoring of officers, the handling of complaints against serving officers, and whether Queensland should establish an independent law enforcement conduct commission,” the report said. When asked about the scope of the inquiry on Tuesday, the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the terms of reference and commissioner will be announced on Wednesday. Anything short of the inquiry envisioned by the taskforce – a genuine attempt to address the underlying issues in police responses – would waste Queensland’s best chance to acknowledge and deal with them. It would also severely undermine any attempt by the state to legislate against coercive control. Women’s groups say the inquiry is “key to the success” of that effort. The evidence says police get domestic violence wrong way too often. In 2017, almost half the women murdered by an intimate partner had been previously misidentified as the perpetrator of domestic violence. Without an attempt to truly understand why so many women have been failed, creating a new criminal offence would only, surely, heighten the risk to the thousands of women who interact with police at their most vulnerable, seeking protection.",News/Society,"Inquiry into Queensland police’s handling of domestic violence is welcome, but will it examine ‘culture’?",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/11/inquiry-into-queensland-polices-handling-of-domestic-violence-is-welcome-but-will-it-examine-culture
5/11/2022,"The electoral commissioner is considering whether unauthorised political signs claiming independent candidates are affiliated with the Greens may breach laws that ban misleading voters. Tom Rogers said the Australian Electoral Commission is “actively” investigating the controversial signs, including slapping entities which may know more with “formal notices” to provide information about the “disappointing” unauthorised material. On Friday independents in Warringah, Mackellar, Hughes and Hume reported their own posters had been ripped down and replaced with near-identical copies bearing Greens branding in what they said was a “coordinated” attack. The AEC has already concluded the signs breach electoral laws which require political material to be authorised, which carry penalties of up to $26,640 for individuals or $132,200 for corporations. It has referred the matter to the electoral integrity assurance taskforce for investigation and is encouraging anyone with information to come forward. Asked if the signs could breach other laws, Rogers told Guardian Australia the AEC is “looking at other offences” including section 329 of the Electoral Act, which bans material that “is likely to mislead or deceive an elector in relation to the casting of a vote”. The provision refers to misleading voters about the process of voting, but does not guarantee truth in political advertising generally. It may apply if the signs are deemed to indicate the independents are the endorsed candidates of the Greens, and therefore indicate a vote for the named candidate is a vote for the Greens. Fines for breaching this section are lower – up to $22,200 for an individual and up to $111,000 for corporation – but it can be punishable by up to three years in prison. “That is a really complex area of law – but we are examining that as well,” Rogers said. “One of the few things that parties and candidates have to do is follow relatively simple authorisation rules … Citizens must know where information comes from. The fact it is unauthorised is concerning.” Rogers said entities the AEC thinks might have information have been issued with “a formal notice”, an apparent reference to the commissioner’s information-gathering powers for investigating unauthorised material. Asked if penalties need to increase to deter unauthorised material, Rogers replied it was “pretty fundamental to a high integrity election to know who is saying what”. “Whatever can be done to deter people from behaving poorly I would endorse.” Rogers noted the AEC had been inundated with complaints through social media about “damaged corflutes, [and] corflutes that have been pulled down”. “Of course we decry that … But it’s not a power we have under the Electoral Act,” he said, explaining they were matters for the police. Rogers said the AEC also has no responsibility for enforcing truth in political advertising, and is not seeking that power, but that was not to say another entity could not be entrusted with such a function. Advance, a conservative political action group that has campaigned against Steggall and other climate-focused independents, has denied it was behind the fake corflutes. “This is absolutely not Advance,” a spokesperson said. “All material produced by Advance is clearly authorised and strictly complies with AEC rules.” The spokesperson said Advance had not received a notice from the AEC. The Australian Electoral Commission has received 2m applications for postal votes, up from 1.5m in 2019. Rogers said this means “more votes in envelopes” making it “more likely there will be unresolved contests on election night”, as ballots can arrive up to two weeks after election day. Prepoll votes are also up, with 305,000 people voting on Monday, the first day of prepolling, up from 120,000 in 2019 – although the prepoll period is shorter in this election cycle.",News/Australia news,"Election signs falsely linking independents to Greens may breach voter deception laws, AEC says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/11/election-signs-falsely-linking-independents-to-greens-may-breach-voter-deception-laws-aec-says
5/11/2022,"Queensland’s opposition has criticised the Palaszczuk government and accused it of failing victims of crime over its review into the state-run forensic laboratory. The government announced a review into the Forensic Scientific Services six weeks ago, after delays and reported failings in the analysis of DNA evidence. On Tuesday, the government tabled the terms of reference for the review in Queensland parliament. The opposition leader, David Crisafulli, said questions remained over who will lead the inquiry and when it will take place. “I will call it as it is, this [review] does not go far enough. It falls well short,” Crisafulli told parliament on Tuesday. “There have been many [previous] reviews … but the government has not acted.” Crisafulli told parliament victims of crime would be disappointed by the review as it will not look into “previous failings” by the lab. The review’s terms of reference state that while specific cases may be examined to inform the scope of the review, it will exclude re-analysis of DNA samples, issues in specific cases and information about identifiable cases. According to the terms of reference, this was because the review “is focused on systems and processes and so as not to prejudice any ongoing or future criminal matters”. Crisafulli said there were “potentially thousands of victims being denied justice”. The health minister, Yvette D’Ath, told parliament that the terms of reference were prepared in consultation with the Queensland Police service and the Crime and Corruption Commission. D’Ath said the “highly specialised set of skills required” for the review meant “there is a limited national pool of potential reviewers.” “We are going through the process of appointing a reviewer, including undertaking normal due diligence,” she said. The Greens South Brisbane MP, Amy MacMahon, said the party would support an independent review as Queensland’s forensic labs “urgently need more resources.” “There’s a damning audit report that revealed huge delays, and not enough lab staff to do the work,” MacMahon said. The state’s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said the review will take place shortly and confirmed the final report will be publicly tabled. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The announcement of the review came after revelations uncovered in the Australian’s podcast series Shandee’s Story, which examined the alleged handling of DNA evidence in a murder case. Shandee Blackburn, 23, died after being stabbed more than 20 times when she was walking home in Mackay in 2013. Forensic biologist Dr Kirsty Wright, who was interviewed on the podcast, described the handling of the murder case as a “trainwreck”. Dr Wright alleged the state-run forensics laboratory was failing to detect DNA in samples taken in rape and sexual assault cases. “This lab and the flawed results and the inaccurate results, it’s compromising our criminal justice system and it’s compromising public safety,” Dr Wright told the podcast. The state coroner re-opened an inquiry into Blackburn’s death last year after a request by the state attorney general, Shannon Fentiman. Shandee’s mother, Vicki Blackburn, previously told the Australian the family would not be satisfied by anything less than an independent review of the state’s forensic labs. “We do not have any faith in any internal review,” Blackburn said. The Queensland Council for Civil Liberties has also raised concerns over the state’s forensic labs. QCCL’s president, Michael Cope, said the appointment of an independent expert to conduct an inquiry would “ensure that public confidence in the administration of justice in the state is maintained.” “The QCCL has been watching the developments in the case of Shandee Blackburn with increasing concern,” he said in a statement last year. “In our view, given the very small forensic science community in this country, that expert should be sourced from overseas.”",News/Australia news,"Review of forensic DNA testing ‘falls short’ for Queensland victims, critics say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/11/review-of-forensic-dna-testing-falls-short-for-queensland-victims-critics-say
5/11/2022,"Ride-share and taxi drivers say the rising cost of petrol is putting them under enormous strain and have bemoaned existing relief measures as a “joke”. Major ride-share companies including Uber introduced a temporary levy in response to record high petrol prices in March. Ola was the first to act, increasing its fares by 15%. Uber’s fuel surcharge for Australian trips, due to lapse on Saturday, added about six cents per kilometre for drivers, or about 50 cents per average trip. The ride-hailing service DiDi followed suit, with a six cent per kilometre fuel surcharge coming into effect on 21 March. Dan Jordan, a spokesperson for DiDi, said it was “no secret” the industry experienced a driver shortage during the pandemic but numbers had increased after the surcharge announcement. He said the surcharge would remain in place for at least 60 days while the company made changes to its service fees and pricing. “DiDi is moving to a flat service fee model in most cities for drivers … along with a slight price increase for riders,” he said. “This latest surcharge [is] yet another initiative that provides additional support in the face of rising fuel prices.” But ride-share drivers say the temporary economic buffer was minimal, and taxi drivers have not been given surcharge rates. One Uber driver, who wished to remain anonymous, said offering 30 cents for a 5km ride was “beyond a joke” because drivers had to travel up to 10km to collect passengers. “The fuel prices will become a big issue in September when the levy is added back on,” he said. “Uber’s greed of 27.5% commission is the issue.” Unleaded petrol prices spiked at more than $2.20 cents a litre in March before dropping to about $1.60 in April thanks to a temporary reprieve on the fuel excise in the federal budget. But prices have since started to rise again and now hover at around $1.80. According to data from MotorMouth, unleaded petrol prices have climbed in every capital city except Brisbane in May. A driver who wished to remain anonymous said Uber drivers were earning “significantly less” than prior to the pandemic, despite a spike in demand since restrictions eased. “The cost-effectiveness and convenience of Uber is at the cost of the drivers and is not reciprocated in the form of equitable earnings,” the driver said. “Everything has gone up, significantly, except fares – petrol, insurance, maintenance, taxes, food. And nothing has reduced in costs. Uber still clips drivers a whopping commission.” James Weir, a ride-share driver, said drivers were forced to be more picky with the trips they accepted, which may have led to a higher than usual cancellation rate in recent months. “The higher prices along with lower real rates have caused drivers to use more discretion when choosing which trips they will take,” he said. An Uber spokesperson told Guardian Australia the company made initial changes to recommended rates last month after feedback from drivers. “We recently made changes to these rates which we believe will help make earnings better for driver-partners while maintaining the reliable, safe and affordable experience that riders love,” they said. Michael Kaine, the national secretary of the Transport Workers’ Union, said the federal government’s refusal to provide targeted relief on fuel prices for drivers had led to many feeling a “deadly squeeze” on already tight margins. “Drivers have no access to minimum pay rights and haven’t seen an increase to their low rates for years,” he said. “The cost-of-living crisis hits owner drivers and gig economy workers twice over. Their outgoings have skyrocketed at home and work. “We need an independent body to set enforceable minimum standards so that cost recovery is never a losing battle.” Taxi drivers have also taken a hit. The Australian Taxi Drivers Association’s president Michael Jools said drivers were suffering “as always, from an un-level playing field”. As taxi fares are regulated by state governments, any fare supplement that isn’t legislated is illegal. “[Petrol prices] fall on the driver and he’s got no way of paying the extra amount because he can’t charge the customer any more,” Jools said. “Drivers are stuck in a very difficult situation.” Jools said the federal government’s temporary reprieve on the fuel excise had gone some way to easing distress, but drivers were still operating on fares set 12 years ago. “Nothing of the increase in operating costs have been passed on through a fare increase,” he said. “Our incomes are hopelessly out of date. We’ve got to work 70 hours a week to earn minimum wage. It requires legislative change.”",News/Australia news,‘Beyond a joke’: Uber and taxi drivers plead for relief as petrol prices rise again,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/11/beyond-a-joke-uber-and-taxi-drivers-plead-for-relief-as-petrol-prices-rise-again
5/11/2022,"WeChat has become a key arena for Australian politicians, media and party faithful to communicate election messaging, but among the usual campaign fare, unauthorised attack ads and wildly enthusiastic “news” articles about candidates have become commonplace. There are also signs that WeChat could again be weaponised with fake news and misleading content, as it was in 2019. There are about three million users of WeChat in Australia. Here’s what we know about how the campaign is playing out on the network so far. WeChat is some times referred to as a Swiss army knife application: a mega app combining the functionality of Facebook, WhatsApp, Uber and Paypal. It has become so ubiquitous in China that it’s hard to function without a WeChat account. It’s needed to pay for goods and to order taxis. Even street food vendors now display the QR codes that drive the system. WeChat is also a major publishing, advertising and communications tool for businesses, both inside and outside China. “Official accounts”, also known as WeChat subscriptions, are like Facebook pages where you can follow and read the latest posts published by the page owner. This is where Chinese-language media operate, along with other organisations and businesses. You need to be a Chinese citizen to apply for an official account, but foreign companies and Australian politicians have obtained accounts through agencies based in China, who offer to register the account on behalf of the organisation. WeChat also has private accounts, which are like a Facebook personal account. With the private account, you can post or participate in individual chats or group chats with friends. But because it is based in China, and subject to censorship rules of the Chinese Communist Party, WeChat is not the same as platforms like Facebook and WhatsApp – and any decision to use it by Australian political parties comes with risks. A recent Lowy Institute survey on Being Chinese in Australia found that while most Chinese-Australians rely on WeChat for Chinese-language news (86%) and contact with friends and family (66%), many are sceptical about the reliability of news shared on the platform. WeChat applies censorship algorithms to news regarded as sensitive to the Chinese government and some subjects are taboo. “WeChat may be driving the most substantial and harmful changes ever observed in Australia’s Chinese-language media sector,” researcher Alex Joske wrote in his 2020 paper The Influence Environment for the thinktank Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “On the one hand, the app is particularly important to Chinese-Australians and helps people stay connected to friends and family in China. It’s also the most popular platform used by Chinese-Australians to access news. “However, WeChat raises concerns because of its record of censorship, information control and surveillance, which align with Beijing’s objectives. “Media outlets on WeChat face tight restrictions that facilitate CCP influence by pushing the vast majority of news accounts targeting Australian audiences to register in China. Networks and information sharing within the app are opaque, contributing to the spread of disinformation.” Take for example the current issue of China’s security agreement with Solomons. Sydney Today, a Chinese-Australian publication which is owned by Media Today, published a story from 9News about the issue, which it translated into Chinese. Despite being no more than a report of public comments by the Australian foreign minister, Marise Payne, that “Australia was deeply disappointed” the Solomons had signed the agreement, it carried a disclaimer. “This article is from 9News, which only represents the original source and the original author’s point of view. It is for reference only and does not represent the attitude and position of this website.” The story did not appear at all on Sydney Today’s WeChat account. Observers said that it was unlikely the Solomons security story would find its way onto any WeChat news sites. There has also been very limited coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on WeChat, with coverage skewed toward Russian statements about the war and its progress. Some publications, like Sydney Today, have developed their own apps to deliver their news to customers on their phones as a means of being able to exercise more control. But many rely on WeChat and, in doing so, tacitly subscribe to this level of censorship. While there is potential for ads and editorial to be misleading or censored, the real risk lies with party operatives and others seeking to influence the election by spreading “fake news” in WeChat groups, which are much harder to monitor and control than public pages. In the 2019 election Labor complained to WeChat about a high volume of misleading anti-Labor material, some of which could be traced back to Liberal party members. There has been at least one report of misinformation circulating this time around but the risks of “fake news” being seeded into chat groups is likely to increase as the election draws closer. Realising that WeChat is an extremely powerful tool to reach Chinese-Australian voters, a number of Australian politicians have opened accounts – sometimes official accounts, sometimes personal accounts. Among those actively using WeChat in this campaign are Carina Garland, Labor’s candidate in Chisholm; Anthony Albanese (the account is called Labor Leader); and Clare O’Neil, the Labor MP for Hotham. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg is buying banner advertisements on WeChat news sites and his staff is using it to recruit volunteers and organise functions. But Fergus Ryan at Aspi warns WeChat is no ordinary social media platform. “Let me put it bluntly: any politician or political party that sees no problem with treating WeChat as a normal social media platform is tacitly compliant with state-sponsored interference in the upcoming election,” he says. “It’s well beyond time that both the Liberal and Labor parties set their own immediate political needs aside and mutually agree to stop using WeChat as a campaign channel and to start work on bipartisan legislation to properly regulate this influential platform.” In January, it was reported the prime minister’s WeChat account had been hacked. In fact, the story was more complicated. Morrison’s official account had been registered to an unknown man in Fujian province, Mr Li, as a way of getting round the terms and conditions of WeChat that prevent foreigners having official accounts. Li had apparently sold the account and the 75,000 subscribers to another Chinese man, who told the PM’s followers the account was being transferred and rebranded as “New Life for Chinese-Australians”. In their enthusiasm to get access to the popular social media site, politicians and businesses are regularly using agency arrangements, which often involve a Chinese social media agency in Australia and an agent in China which legally holds the account. The risks inherent in the agency arrangement are clear – not only can you lose control but you are submitting to the censorship of WeChat. The major parties did not respond to questions about their approach to WeChat in this election. WeChat is being used to build Chinese speaking volunteer networks from among Chinese student populations. For example, an advertisement in Chinese targeted at recruiting volunteers in the Sydney seat of Bennelong. “We need volunteers. Location: Eastwood Shopping Mall. Time: Monday to Saturday (from May 2 to May 21) from 9am to 6pm, you can choose half day or full day,” one advertisement appearing on WeChat reads. “We provide tea, lunch, water and transport, we will give volunteer a certificate of work experience.” Frydenberg’s campaign has been recruiting in his seat of Kooyong. Ye Xue, a researcher at Australian National University who is studying international students and their engagement with politics, said the volunteering certificate is a big drawcard because it looks good on a student’s CV. The involvement also provides an opportunity to network with business and political elites. But he said some international students may not fully appreciate the activity they are being asked to do is campaign for a political party, and that it could embroil them in heated discussions with other students.",News/Australia news,A Swiss army knife app: what is WeChat and how is it being used in Australia’s 2022 federal election?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/10/a-swiss-army-knife-app-what-is-wechat-and-how-is-it-being-used-in-australias-2022-federal-election
5/11/2022,"“I was a cancer surgeon. That was before I did this.” On my way to a conference, the taxi driver has taken an inordinate interest in my work until I am forced to reveal that I am an oncologist. I am impressed by his insightful comments, but it never crosses my mind that he might be a doctor himself. The disclosure makes me sink deeper into my seat to render myself invisible. He fled his country during war. When he turned his mind to medicine, the hurdles were onerous and the rules opaque. The thought of going back 20 years to the beginning of residency was unpalatable. There was little guidance and a perceived hostility towards skills accumulated in a “no-name” hospital, never mind that some of the most astute doctors are those who have mastered their skills in resource-strained settings. He jokes that his new job is a lot like medicine – you get to meet lots of interesting people, but I can’t help thinking of the sheer waste of talent when a surgeon becomes a taxi driver. An overseas-trained surgeon was once appointed as my intern. He had long forgotten how to interpret ECGs or adjust the insulin dose, but put him in front of a complex MRI or a terrified pre-op patient and he shone. Sadly, day after day I watched his niche skills atrophy while he figured out mundane tasks. I tried to “tutor” him, but turning an accomplished surgeon into a medical intern felt demeaning. Eventually, he gave up on his dream of reprising his former role, thus proving a loss to his country of birth and his adopted one. The pandemic-fuelled exhaustion of doctors and nurses has forced many rich countries to improvise. Australia relies very heavily on foreign-trained doctors and nurses to sustain its healthcare system. Around half of the healthcare workforce was born overseas and a quarter trained overseas, typically in India, China, the Philippines and the UK. Recently, the Victorian government proposed a plan to lure foreign professionals by paying them $2,000 to relocate. When there were few takers, the amount was multiplied fivefold but there was still no stampede. The idea of paying experts to leave their own country to fulfil a local need creates an ethical dilemma. Last month when I was in India, I did not meet a single person unaffected by the pandemic. While the official figure was almost 500,000 dead, the World Health Organization estimates the true number to be closer to 4 million, including droves of frontline healthcare workers. But amid the rickety infrastructure, I saw clear evidence of progress and ambitious goals to achieve better population health. My childhood friend is a doctor serving the slum-dwellers of Mumbai. Her team screens people for preventable diseases, including cancer and diabetes, and treats common illnesses before they become a problem. Each community worker has a footprint we could scarcely comprehend in the rich world. If we lured just one of these professionals to Australia for the negligible cost of $10,000, who would bear the largest cost of all? The patients without a voice and the country that spent money training them. In 2013, researchers estimated that Australia saved US$1.7bn in medical education costs through the arrival of foreign-born medical practitioners over just the previous five years. Still, one might argue that in a free world, workers should be free to take their skills wherever they want. So, it’s the second issue about importing workers that should give us pause for thought. The workforce shortage in rural and remote regions is so dire that without international workers, there would often be no one to see the patients. Nearly all doctors are sent to rural and remote areas to provide years of service, with conditional registration and limited rights of practice that local graduates often refuse. Many struggle with social adjustment and cultural dissonance. There may also be an unemployed spouse and dislocated children in tow. Add to this the dilution of prestige and career uncertainty and the average international graduate has a lot to contend with in a new country. But what rankles most is the professional purgatory. In far-flung places, there can be a lack of mentoring and guidance because of an emphasis on patient turnover rather than supporting professional aspirations. Zoom meetings, sold as the solution to isolation, are no match for the incidental corridor consult, a chat on the way home, or the hand of a caring colleague on the shoulder. To add insult to injury, certain overseas trained doctors tend to attract a higher rate of complaints. Indeed, some patients unabashedly tell me that their “foreign” doctor or nurse is “no good”. I bristle at this broad accusation because the situation might be different if they received a proper orientation, a cultural education, and ongoing professional and pastoral care. In the absence of these things, career progression can become an afterthought. I once worked with an overseas doctor who held aloft the emergency department. Every day, he plastered fractures, removed splinters, drained wounds, reversed overdoses and resuscitated hearts. His range of skills was unparalleled and the community admired him. But year after year, he remained the workhorse while others became his boss. He was never considered good enough to lead a department or even head a small team. Most galling was the presumption that coming to Australia marked the peak of his ambitions. He left as soon as he could. Qualified medical specialists can have a particularly difficult time satisfying standards of equivalence. While scrutiny is essential for patient safety, there is concern that doctors from non-western countries often face a higher bar for acceptance by specialist colleges, eliciting calls for fairness, transparency and respect in assessing qualifications. There has been recent progress in this sphere, but much more is needed to inform prospective arrivals of the hurdles they will encounter. Smoothing their way and respecting their needs is not the same as giving them a “free pass”. There have always been calls for local graduates to serve the local population – this will take time, and frankly, a lot of convincing. In the meantime, if overseas trained professionals are attracted to the excellent Australian healthcare system, we should be proud. But it behoves us to realise that those who come here make many sacrifices and are doing us a favour by supporting the healthcare system to be the best that it can be. It is our duty to judge them fairly and treat them well.",Opinion/Opinion,Australia relies on overseas-trained medical experts yet consigns them to professional purgatory | Ranjana Srivastava,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/10/australia-relies-on-overseas-trained-medical-experts-yet-consigns-them-to-professional-purgatory
5/11/2022,"Most prominent independent candidates say they would negotiate with either Labor or the Liberals in the event of a hung parliament, with many indicating they would support whichever party met their policy demands on climate and integrity. Guardian Australia asked more than a dozen high-profile lower house independent candidates and sitting crossbench MPs how they would approach negotiations with major parties in the event of a hung parliament. Almost all of them identified major commitments on climate change and a federal integrity commission as their key demands in any negotiations. The two issues were repeatedly cited as the most commonly raised in their respective electorates. The majority said they would talk with either of the major parties. They include the Indi independent Helen Haines, Curtin candidate Kate Chaney, the Casey candidate Claire Ferres Miles, the Wentworth candidate Allegra Spender and Kylea Tink, Zoe Daniel and Monique Ryan, who are standing in North Sydney, Goldstein, and Kooyong respectively. In a policy-centric sentiment common among the independents, Daniel said: “The major parties know exactly where I stand on climate, integrity and gender equality. If my community elects me based on those pillars, it would be for the leaders of the major parties to engage based on those priorities.” Only Adam Bandt, the Greens leader and sitting MP for Melbourne, expressly ruled out support for the Liberal government in the event of a hung parliament, saying the party’s “key climate demand will be for the next Labor government to stop opening new coal and gas mines”. Sitting independent Zali Steggall said she would negotiate with either side, but added: “At the end of the day Scott Morrison has had three years as prime minister, and he has failed to deliver action on climate change, he has failed to deliver the federal integrity commission he promised at the last election, and he has overseen way too many rorts when it comes to spending of public money.” Fellow sitting independent Andrew Wilkie said he would not make any deals in the event of a hung parliament and would not guarantee supply, saying he would “decide every issue on its merits, including questions of confidence and supply to any particular party”. “What constitutes merit is the sum of many considerations including the views of the community and my conscience,” Wilkie said. Wilkie’s refusal to enter into an agreement with either of the major parties follows his experience with Julia Gillard’s minority government when the then Labor prime minister broke a deal with the Tasmanian MP on gambling reforms. None of the candidates said they would be influenced by promises of money being pumped into their electorates. Ferres Miles and Chaney said such funding decisions needed to be made “transparently” and according to evidence-based needs. Haines said: “I would never sell my ability to vote on every piece of legislation as it comes before the House in return for local spending promises.” Three of the candidates – Haines, Chaney and Spender – indicated that their approach to the negotiations would be influenced by the composition of parliament after the election. “Those negotiations will depend on a couple of things,” Spender said. “First, it will depend on the overall composition of parliament – that is, how many seats each party has won. Second, it will depend on what each party says about the issues my community cares the most about.” Haines, Ferres Miles and Chaney each named a policy commitment that is non-negotiable for them in any negotiations. For Ferres Miles, that was the “need to increase their targets for 2030 to a minimum of 50% emissions reduction or higher, aligned with the Business Council of Australia”. Haines and Chaney identified a federal corruption commission as a non-negotiable commitment. “A commitment to legislate the Australian federal integrity commission as soon as possible would be a commitment I would require in return for my support, but it would not be my only consideration,” Haines said.",News/Australia news,High-profile independents say they will negotiate with either major party in event of hung parliament,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/11/high-profile-independents-will-negotiate-with-either-major-party-hung-parliament-teal-australia-federal-election-2022
5/11/2022,"A subterranean campaign on the Chinese language social media platform WeChat has ramped up in the final weeks of the 2022 federal election campaign, with material being shared in private groups that alleges Labor and the Greens will fund school programs to turn students gay, impose new taxes and destroy Chinese wealth. The “posters” – well-produced posts designed for WeChat – carry no party authorisation, but for the most part support the Liberal party. Several have been obtained by the Guardian. They were seeded into Liberal MP Gladys Liu’s volunteer group and elsewhere just before and after the second debate. At this stage there is no information about their origins or how widely they have been shared. But they appear to be circulating in both Sydney and Melbourne. Contacted by the Guardian, Liu the member for Chisholm, said: “I have never seen this material before and have had no involvement with its production or distribution.” The posts pick up many of the themes that were run within the Chinese community in the 2019 campaign and appear designed to damage Labor among socially conservative Chinese-speaking voters. It is impossible to determine their origins and whether they are the work of an individual, a group, a party or a state actor. A poster with a pink background includes an extract from a Daily Telegraph article which claims: “Labor’s national policy platform removed ‘mother’, ‘breastfeeding’, ‘pregnant women’ and other words. The poster refers to the article with comments including: “Some have questioned whether Albo has the ability to stop the woke “erasing” women if he won the election. Labor has ‘betrayed’ women.”, the poster says. There is no suggestion the author of the article is aware of or authorised its use. A poster with a green background focuses on the supposed economic risk of Labor, warning it would “cancel negative gearing, raise the tax rates, the mortgage rate will rise, the unemployment rate will rise, the cost of living will rise, income will drop and family wealth will drop.” The poster has been shared within a group of 81 people, called the Australia-China Literary Garden. “In the past 50 years, Labor created the highest RBA interest rate (18%) in history in 1990 during its government; in 1992, it created the highest rate of unemployment in history (11.2%)“ the poster says. “Liberal has created the lowest RBA rates (0.1%) during its government in 2021. In 2022 it creates the lowest unemployment rate in history (4%).” Posters have also appeared in a video group, EnjLifeWide. The site is linked to Jen Li, a volunteer who works on Gladys Liu’s campaign. Contacted by the Guardian, Li said she had only taken photographs of the posters to bring them to the attention of Liu’s campaign, and that she had nothing to do with creating them. “ I do not have those skills,’ she said. Another post reads: “If you vote for Labor, you are voting for the following disasters:1. increase tax;2. cancel negative gearing, heavily discourage Chinese people’s property investment, house price plummets;3. interest rate rises, property houses plummet, your wealth decreases;4. cost of living increases rapidly, money becomes worthless;5. The Australian economy enters depression and slows down;6. You will lose your jobs and houses;7. Refugees flood in, taking your wealth away.8. The country has to borrow loans to survive.” Separately, immediately after the second debate this week a user called Jaylin Mao posted an article from April 2019 about the Safe Schools program. Jaylin Mao is the name of a businesswoman who has been previously identified as a Liberal member and is a former president of the Australia-Sichuan Chamber of Commerce. Mao could not be contacted for comment at her listed place of work and did not reply to requests via Facebook and The Guardian has been unable to confirm that she is the person who made the posts or that she is aware of their content. It was shared into a group on WeChat called “ATC” which is a group for Chinese speakers interested in horse-racing with 274 members. The article says: “Labor and Greens make people not to love God. They encourage same-sex marriage, promiscuity, abortion, unreasonably distribute high welfare, encourage lazy people to not take responsibilities, leading to the split of families and incomplete homes for children who suffer from mental harm and will become problematic young people, eventually breaking social harmony.” “(They) promote the so-called ‘Safe School Program’ to educate little kids about homosexuality in primary schools, about switching their gender. (They) spend your money educating your children (to become) homosexual, letting you have no descendants and making population plummet.” “On the other hand, they use humanity as an excuse, they get a large group of ethnicities who only give birth to get welfare and have no Christian faith to enter Australia. This will shake Australia’s foundation of faith, this is an exchange for political benefits by sacrificing national interest.” Keeping track of this kind of misinformation/unauthorised information campaigns is notoriously difficult. There is nothing illegal about sharing articles and images for personal purposes, however, if the material originated with a political party or another group intending to influence voting then it should carry an authorisation from the original publisher. Australia has no laws requiring truth in political advertising, which means that there is nothing to stop misleading material. The Australian electoral commission said it responds to complaints but is not specifically monitoring political activity on WeChat.

5/11/2022,"Coral bleaching affected more than 90% of reefs surveyed along the Great Barrier Reef this year, according to a report by government scientists that confirms the natural landmark has suffered its sixth mass bleaching event on record. The Reef snapshot: summer 2021-22, quietly published by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority on Tuesday night after weeks of delay, said above-average water temperatures in late summer had caused coral bleaching throughout the 2,300km reef system, but particularly in the central region between Cape Tribulation and the Whitsundays. “The surveys confirm a mass bleaching event, with coral bleaching observed at multiple reefs in all regions,” a statement accompanying the report said. “This is the fourth mass bleaching event since 2016 and the sixth to occur on the Great Barrier Reef since 1998.” It was the first mass bleaching event recorded during a cooler La Niña year. Scientists from the marine park authority and the Australian Institute of Marine Science surveyed 719 shallow water reefs between the Torres Strait and the Capricorn Bunker Group at the southern end of the reef system, mostly using helicopters. They found 654 reefs showed some bleaching. A map published with the report shows the most severe and extreme bleaching occurred in the region that covers the areas most visited by tourists. The report said inshore and offshore reefs were badly affected. Scientists from the marine park authority were not available to comment on the report on Tuesday night. The authority’s chief scientist, Dr David Wachenfeld, told the Guardian in March that bleaching was not expected in a La Niña. “But having said that, the climate is changing and the planet and the reef is about 1.5 degrees centigrade warmer than it was 150 years ago,” he said. “Because of that, the weather is changing. Unexpected events are now to be expected. Nothing surprises me any more.” Lissa Schindler, a campaign manager with the Australian Marine Conservation Society, said the report was “devastating news for anyone who loves the reef” and “yet more evidence” cutting fossil fuel emissions should be top priority for the next Australian government. “This was a La Nina year, normally characterised by more cloud cover and rain,” she said. “It should have been a welcome reprieve for our reef to help it recover and yet the snapshot shows more than 90% of the reefs surveyed exhibited some bleaching. “Although bleaching is becoming more and more frequent, this is not normal and we should not accept that this is the way things are. We need to break the norms that are breaking our reef.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Schindler said while Labor had a commitment to make bigger emissions cuts by 2030 than the Coalition, neither party had targets in line with what would be needed globally to save the reef. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change found limiting global heating to 1.5C rather than 2C would probably be the difference between the survival of some tropical reef corals and their complete decline. A report by Climate Analytics found the Coalition’s 2030 emissions reduction target was consistent with more than 3C of heating and Labor’s target about 2C. The director of research at the Climate Council, Dr Simon Bradshaw, said: “This is an issue that cannot be solved with big shiny funding announcements. The science is very clear: in order to save the world’s reefs from total destruction, we must dramatically reduce emissions in the 2020s.” Scientists started raising the alarm for this year’s bleaching event in December, when ocean temperatures over the reef hit a record high for that month. Bleaching occurs when the coral becomes stressed from above-average water temperatures. The coral animal expels the photosynthetic algae that lives inside it and provides the coral with food and its colour. Corals can survive bleaching events. Scientists plan to carry out in-water checks to see how many corals survived and regained their algae and colour between now and the end of the year. Studies have shown that heat stress can have several “sublethal” effects on corals, including making them more susceptible to disease, slowing their growth and limiting their ability to spawn. The release of the report and maps follows leading coral scientist Prof Terry Hughes last week calling on the marine authority to make them public, saying they had been delayed for no reason. Conservationists have said the state of the environment report, a five-yearly national assessment that has been sitting with the environment minister, Sussan Ley, since December, is also yet to be published.",News/Environment,‘Devastating’: 90% of reefs surveyed on Great Barrier Reef affected by coral bleaching in 2022,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/10/devastating-90-of-reefs-surveyed-on-great-barrier-reef-affected-by-coral-bleaching-in-2022
5/11/2022,"Less than two weeks out from election day, the prospect of a hung parliament remains very real. Such an eventuality would thrust successful independent and crossbench MPs into the spotlight as kingmakers, much as it did in 2010. But how would crossbench and independent lower house MPs approach negotiations with the major parties? What policy commitments would they seek, what would be non-negotiable, and how would they approach the negotiation process itself? Guardian Australia surveyed 13 prominent independent candidates and sitting crossbench MPs about how they would approach such negotiations if elected. Each was asked the following questions: What would the starting point be for your negotiations? Would you prioritise early talks with the party that won the most seats? Would any decision on who you support be influenced by who is leading the Liberal or National parties? What would be the most important policy issues for you in negotiations? Are there any non-negotiable policy commitments you would demand from the major parties before giving them your support? Would promises by the major parties to spend on projects in your electorate influence your decision on who to support? Would you seek any commitments made by the major parties to be codified or formalised through something more than a verbal agreement? Would the voting history of your electorate influence your decision on which party to support? Are there any other considerations that would be important to you in this process? Here are their responses in full. What would the starting point be for your negotiations? Would you prioritise early talks with the party that won the most seats? I would prioritise early talks with the party that won the most seats. Would any decision on who you support be influenced by who is leading the Liberal or National parties? It is up to each party to decide which leader best represents their values. I would be willing to work with whoever is leading the parties. What would be the most important policy issues for you in negotiations? Integrity and climate. Are there any non-negotiable policy commitments you would demand from the major parties before giving them your support? We need an anti-corruption commission with teeth. Climate is a bit more complex – I would like to see a target in line with the science, a governance structure that de-politicises decarbonisation, a phasing out of fossil fuel subsidies and a clear path to meeting appropriate targets. There would be a range of approaches available to address these issues. Would promises by the major parties to spend on projects in your electorate influence your decision on who to support? No. Our federal government needs to be allocating funding according to need and objective criteria, not for political purposes. As a previously safe seat, there has been an under-investment of federal money in Curtin and I would advocate for worthy projects in my electorate. But most importantly, I would advocate for a fair and transparent system, where projects are assessed against objective and disclosed criteria across the country. I think Curtin residents (and all Australians) are appalled at the amount of taxpayers’ money that is spent on pork-barrelling. Would you seek any commitments made by the major parties to be codified or formalised through something more than a verbal agreement? Possibly. This would be part of the negotiations. Would the voting history of your electorate influence your decision on which party to support? It would certainly be a factor that I would take into consideration, but the decision would also be driven by the priorities on which I’d been elected. Are there any other considerations that would be important to you in this process? As an independent, it’s quite simple. My duty is to the voters of Curtin and ensuring that they are represented in our parliament. I won’t have a duty to secret donors, party factions, Coalition partners or unions. It’s about the Curtin community – and the people of Curtin are telling me they want to see the major parties held to account. What would the starting point be for your negotiations? Would you prioritise early talks with the party that won the most seats? In a balance of power situation (a hung parliament) my actions will be driven by my values together with my assessment of each major parties’ alignment to and commitment to deliver, without delay, the four priority issues the people of Casey have told me matter to you: Immediate, meaningful, and effective action on climate change. A federal Icac to deliver a better standard of politics, restoring transparency, accountability, and integrity. Equity, diversity, and inclusion across society based on shared values and behaviours A national resilience plan so we are prepared, ready to response and recover from more frequent extreme weather events. Would any decision on who you support be influenced by who is leading the Liberal or National parties? No. As an independent I am not aligned to any political party. I am party agnostic. I have never been a member of a political party. I will work with any member of parliament irrespective of their party who want to deliver the same priorities as the people of Casey. What would be the most important policy issues for you in negotiations? As answered above – action on climate change, delivery without delay [of] a federal Icac, equity and inclusion and a national resilience plan, the four priority policies that I have heard matter to the people of Casey. Are there any non-negotiable policy commitments you would demand from the major parties before giving them your support? None of the major parties have a sufficiently ambitious policy on climate change action, with a need to increase their targets for 2030 to a minimum of 50% emissions reduction or higher, aligned with the Business Council of Australia. Would promises by the major parties to spend on projects in your electorate influence your decision on who to support? No. All public funding decisions need to be based on agreed transparent publicly reported funding criteria, with evidence-based decisions of the highest probity and independent peer review to determine highest public value. Stewardship of public money require the highest integrity and rigour, agnostic of electoral boundaries and alignment or not to select political parties. Would you seek any commitments made by the major parties to be codified or formalised through something more than a verbal agreement? All commitments made must be formally written down, signed and transparently reported to the public. Would the voting history of your electorate influence your decision on which party to support? No. As an independent I am not aligned to any political party. I am party agnostic. I have never been a member of a political party. I will work with any member of parliament, irrespective of their party, who want to deliver the same priorities as the people of Casey. Are there any other considerations that would be important to you in this process? I work for the people of Casey, not the parties. I have no political allegiances and I am not aligned to any interest groups – only the people of Casey. I have never been a member of a political party. I am standing to get things done, to deliver for Casey. As an independent I am not aligned with nor controlled by any political party. As an independent MP I will listen to the voices of the people of Casey, to represent the interests of Casey each and every day. I will always vote for the people of Casey. My vote in Canberra will not be dictated to by a party. By choosing to vote for an independent, the electorate of Casey is wanting someone to bring an independent mind to each issue, and not follow a party ideology. The issues that my electorate have identified as being most important at this election are meaningful climate action, including setting a minimum 50% 2030 emissions reduction target and legislating Australia’s 2050 net zero target. My community have also told me that a federal anti-corruption commission with teeth, support for small business and Australians dealing with rising cost of living pressures, and improved public health and mental health services are also important issues that need to be tackled by the next parliament. The major parties have not released all their policies. More importantly, Australians in Mackellar and across the country have yet to vote. Those are the first and most important steps to determine who forms our next government. If required, I will enter into any negotiation in good faith, aiming to secure an outcome that reflects the values of Mackellar voters and the best interests of the country. On each piece of legislation, I’ll consult with the community, not a party room, before voting. In Australia, federal government has always been best when it has operated from the centre. I will negotiate for a sensible, responsible, centrist government. Those negotiations will depend on a couple of things. First, it will depend on the overall composition of parliament – that is, how many seats each party has won. Second, it will depend on what each party says about the issues my community cares the most about. In those negotiations, I will get the best deal for the people of Wentworth. The community has been clear to me about what that looks like: strong climate action, a federal integrity commission, and a future-focused economy. This is about the policies, not the people. I am happy to work with anyone to get the best deal for the people of Wentworth. I have worked collaboratively with both the government and opposition over the last three years and will continue to do so, no matter who forms government. The actual outcome of the election is an important factor, and I will vote on each bill on its merits, including supply bills. When it comes to the numbers, I acknowledge that the outcome of the election will be important – that is, how many seats each party obtains in both the House of Representatives and the Senate and the ability of each party to pass legislation in both chambers. I would of course be talking to both sides about all issues but in particular the key policy areas that I have taken to the people of Warringah. If my community re-elects me, then clearly they trust me to represent them and prioritise key policies of climate and environment, integrity and fiscal discipline. If we end up with a hung parliament, that’s an indictment on the major parties failing to put forward adequate policies on these issues. I want to see good policy, and for good long-term policy you actually need a bi-partisan collaborative approach, but at the federal level all we see is gamesmanship and attempts to wedge the other side, and I think I represent a lot of people in the community who are really tired of old party politics and are turning to independents. At the end of the day Scott Morrison has had three years as prime minister, and he has failed to deliver action on climate change, he has failed to deliver the federal integrity commission he promised at the last election, and he has overseen way too many rorts when it comes to spending of public money. Deciding how to approach a potential balance of power situation involves weighing up a series of hypothetical questions, assumptions and variables, all of which I am considering carefully as we approach the election. Every election, every electorate chooses a representative to go to parliament to make decisions on behalf of their community based on their values and their policies, and in that sense I am no different. If I am re-elected as the independent federal member for Indi, and neither of the major parties won enough seats to form majority government, I would start by sitting down with the leaders of both the major parties to discuss the issues that matter to the people of Indi. I believe I would first sit down with the party that has won the most seats at the election. The issues that are important to the people of Indi are clear: a robust federal integrity commission that stamps out corruption in politics, real action on climate change that brings opportunity and investment into the regions, and proper investment in regional health and mental healthcare. A commitment to legislate the Australian Federal Integrity Commission as soon as possible would be a commitment I would require in return for my support, but it would not be my only consideration. A robust federal integrity commission is a priority for more than eight out of 10 Australians. I would never sell my ability to vote on every piece of legislation as it comes before the House in return for local spending promises. I would never give up my right to vote in the interests of Indi every time. At this election, where more communities are seeking to make their voices heard through seeking Independent representation, it is vital that politicians and the media listen to the message these communities are sending. No electorate “belongs” to any party or any MP, it is for the people to give, and for candidates to earn their trust and their votes and to represent the electorate. In balance of power, the Greens will kick the Liberals out and push the next government to act on the climate crisis and the inequality crisis. We don’t want to see the Liberals return with a new leader, we want them gone. Our key climate demand will be for the next Labor government to stop opening new coal and gas mines. You can’t put the fire out while pouring petrol on it, but Labor and Liberal both back 114 new coal and gas projects across the country, which is criminal. We will also push the next government to get dental and mental health into Medicare, build 1m affordable homes people can rent for 25% of their income or buy for $300,000, lift income support, wipe student debt and make childcare free. Revenue can be raised by making billionaires and big corporations pay their fair share of tax. As to the form of any understanding, we will enter any discussions with open minds and strong principles, but we expect Labor’s desire to open new coal and gas mines in a climate emergency to be the area we’ll have to push the hardest. If I’m elected, I would be open to working with both parties to see who would provide the best deal on the issues most important to the North Sydney community, such as urgent action on climate, the economy, integrity and equality for all. I’m an independent MP and don’t favour any political party. In the event that neither major party win a majority of seats at the election, I will not do any formal deals and instead decide every issue on its merits, including questions of confidence and supply to any particular party. What constitutes merit is the sum of many considerations including the views of the community and my conscience. Any decisions I need to make immediately after the election will be done so as soon as possible. As I have repeatedly stated, I would stand ready to enter discussions with either of the men who would be in a position to become prime minister. I will not nominate who I would support before the voters have even delivered their verdict. Negotiation means exactly that: negotiation. The major parties know exactly where I stand on climate, integrity and gender equality. If my community elects me based on those pillars, it would be for the leaders of the major parties to engage based on those priorities. Scott Morrison changed his mind on an integrity commission after the last election. Who knows? He might change his mind again after the election if the prime ministership is at stake. In the event of a hung parliament, I will work with all parties to secure an outcome that aligns with the values of the Kooyong community on which I was elected. My vote will always be independent, informed by expert evidence and the views and values of my Kooyong community. My commitment is to the people of Kooyong, not any party, donor or lobbyist.

5/11/2022,"ABC veterans Kerry O’Brien and Philip Williams have thrown their weight behind a campaign to encourage people to vote for political candidates who support a well-funded ABC. “At no point in my lifetime, has the ABC been more important than it is today,” O’Brien says in a video published by ABC Alumni whose members are ex-ABC staff. Williams, the ABC’s former chief correspondent who retired last year, says former prime minister Tony Abbott abolished the ABC’s international arm, the Australia Network, nine years ago while Labor was promising to boost the ABC’s role in the Pacific. Williams said the ABC had closed several of its foreign bureaux in recent years and any further reduction in funding could lead to more cuts. “I’m really worried the ABC won’t be able to keep covering the world as it has done if its funding is squeezed even more,” Williams says in the video. Before the election was called, the Morrison government promised to restore ABC funding to 2018 levels, when Malcolm Turnbull imposed an $84m indexation pause. The ALP has pledged to focus on regional broadcasting with an $8m a year increase to the ABC’s international program. O’Brien said the ABC was “hopelessly behind” financially since the Abbott government was elected in 2013. “A strong ABC is absolutely crucial in a landscape where democracy seems to be losing its way and the media has been weakened,” he said. “The ABC cannot function the way it should be able to because financially it has been bleeding for the past nine years.” The ABC has lost $783m in funding since the Coalition came to power in 2014, according to a 2020 report on the accumulated impact of government cuts to the public broadcaster. Williams and O’Brien are two of several former ABC staff, including ex-Media Watch host Jonathan Holmes, to front election videos. “The time has come for those who say they love the ABC, who say they rely on the ABC, to stand up and be counted,” O’Brien says in his video. “Our vote is one of the most precious things we have. So is the ABC, so please, make your vote count – back the candidates who support a stronger, better-funded ABC.” Pete Lewis is a bit of a legend in rural Australia. Pete’s election campaign message for ABC Alumni echoes the words of former MD Mark Scott: “The further you get from Ultimo, the closer you get to the beating heart of the ABC.” #Vote1ABC pic.twitter.com/kaarjkqcCl The former Four Corners, 7.30 and Lateline host said 70% of Australians trust the ABC but it was “constantly under attack” from the likes of right-wing lobby group the Institute for Public Affairs which produced a five-part podcast last year called Their ABC: What’s wrong with the ABC and how to fix it. “The IPA believes that ABC is dangerous for democracy, and it is incompatible with a free society,” O’Brien says. “More than a dozen federal Coalition politicians contributed to that podcast.” They included Bridget McKenzie, Nicolle Flint, Matt Canavan, James Paterson and Andrew Bragg. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning O’Brien warned that in the US, which spends less per capita on public broadcasting than Australia, misinformation was “endangering America’s democracy”. “Only 29% of Americans trust the mainstream news media,” O’Brien says in the video. “Australians don’t trust their media much either. But 70% do trust the ABC more than any other news source. Yet it is constantly under attack.” In 2018, the government was forced to deny it wanted to privatise the ABC after the Liberal party federal council voted overwhelmingly to privatise the ABC. Then prime minister Turnbull was not in the room when delegates voted to support the Young Liberals’ motion to sell all parts of the ABC that did not service rural regions. Labor has pledged to extend the ABC’s triennial funding cycle to five years, an idea supported by former competition tsar Rod Sims. Sims has called for “strong and clear” ABC governance and stable funding for the public broadcaster and said privatising the ABC would “represent extremely poor economic and public policy.”",News/Australia news,ABC veterans call on voters to back election candidates who support the public broadcaster,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/11/abc-veterans-call-on-voters-to-back-election-candidates-who-support-the-public-broadcaster
5/11/2022,"Plans for a blanket amnesty for Troubles-related offences have been scrapped and the UK government will instead offer immunity only to those who cooperate with truth recovery investigations. The original proposal had caused outrage in Northern Ireland where it was viewed as an attempt to shield security forces veterans from prosecution, leaving victims’ families without hope of truth or justice. Downing Street on Tuesday retreated from the original plan, which had been popular with army veterans and rightwing Tory MPs, and revealed a tweaked version that will make immunity conditional on cooperation with a new Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery. “The new commission provides the best route to give victims and their families the answers they have sought for years as well as giving our veterans the certainty they deserve,” said an official note accompanying the Queen’s speech, which flagged the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill. Most of the 3,500 killings during the Troubles are unsolved, leaving a backlog of “legacy” cases that have bedevilled politics and policing in Northern Ireland. A handful of recent prosecutions involving former soldiers collapsed. Veterans groups said there was a “witch-hunt” against old soldiers. The government’s original proposal offered a de facto amnesty for troops that would almost certainly also have applied to members of the IRA and other paramilitary groups, a prospect that prompted condemnation from victims groups, unionists, nationalists and the Irish government. The new version outlined in the Queen’s speech, which was delivered by Prince Charles, sought to mollify critics by incentivising alleged perpetrators to divulge information in return for amnesty. Alleged perpetrators who do not cooperate with the commission or who fail to fully share information will remain open to prosecution. In addition to uncovering information about Troubles-related deaths and serious injuries, the new body will be tasked with producing a historical record of what is known in relation to every death that occurred during the Troubles. It is understood that existing inquests and civil rights cases can proceed as normal and that future Troubles-related cases will be folded into the reconciliation and information recovery process. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the Democratic Unionist party leader, gave a guarded response, telling the BBC he needed to see more details. “We will judge what the government proposes against whether the opportunity for justice remains,” he added. Colum Eastwood, the Social Democratic and Labour party leader and MP, said Boris Johnson’s administration lacked credibility on the issue. “There is no one who has faith in this government to do the right thing by victims and survivors.” The Irish government made no immediate response. It has previously urged the UK government to implement a stalled 2014 agreement that laid out a strategy for legacy cases. Padraig Yeates, a historian and member of the legacy campaign group Truth Recovery Process welcomed the apparent abandonment of a blanket amnesty but said it was too early to judge the new proposal. “It must be based on a mediation and reconciliation model such as we are advocating, centred on addressing the needs of victims and survivors and providing for their redress, as well as protecting the rights of former combatants.” The Queen’s speech also announced a plan to legislate for the Irish language, which has been another contentious issue since the DUP blocked Sinn Féin’s efforts to pass an Irish language act. Last year Downing Street promised Sinn Féin it would bypass the Stormont assembly and pass the legislation at Westminster.",News/UK news,Troubles-era investigations will give amnesty only to those who cooperate,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/10/troubles-era-investigations-will-give-amnesty-only-to-those-who-cooperate
5/11/2022,"Labour MPs have expressed private frustration that Keir Starmer’s pledge to resign if he is fined by Durham constabulary for the Beergate investigation will lead to leadership jostling among ambitious shadow ministers. Both Starmer and his deputy, Angela Rayner, were at the event at Durham Miners Hall where a takeaway curry for the MPs and their aides is now subject to an investigation into whether it was a social event banned under Covid-19 rules in place in April last year. Starmer has said no rules were broken and that staff ate while working on an election campaign. Sources said Starmer told aides he wanted to announce he was prepared to resign three days before they agreed with his judgment, after days of anguish in his top team led the frustrated Labour leader to seek outside counsel from former advisers. The majority of shadow ministers said they were grimly resigned to Starmer’s pledge – but said there were likely to be internal consequences. “I think once you start talking up the prospect of your own resignation you are on dangerous ground,” one said. Another veteran MP, a Starmer loyalist, said they suspected ulterior motives from some shadow cabinet members. “If you fancy Keir’s job, this is win-win,” they said. Rule changes pushed through at last year’s Labour conference mean a fifth of MPs must nominate any candidate for the party leadership in order for them to be put to a members’ postal vote – a higher threshold than under Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership and a move that was seen by those on the left as intending to disadvantage their candidates. One MP said a snap leadership contest would put ascendant shadow cabinet ministers such as Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, in an advantageous position. “[Starmer’s] disappearance now would obviously benefit the Blairite right – [the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy] Burnham couldn’t stand, Sadiq Khan [the London mayor] couldn’t stand, Angela would be out of the picture for the same reason as Keir because if he goes on this she has said she will go too.” If both Starmer and Rayner are forced to resign, there is no obvious interim leader. The most senior members of Starmer’s shadow cabinet – Rachel Reeves, the shadow chancellor; Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary; David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary; Streeting; and Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary – are all potential candidates in a contest. The party’s national executive committee would have to vote to designate an alternative member of the shadow cabinet. A source close to Starmer said he was relaxed about the ambitions of his shadow cabinet. “I don’t think anyone is actively trying to undermine him. It says a lot about our party that there are so many potential candidates – look at the contrast again with the Tories. If people are ambitious, let them be.” An ally of Streeting said: “Wes was on the media batting for Keir three times over the weekend and into Monday. He’s one of Keir’s most loyal and vocal supporters. After a great set of a local election results there is everything to play for at the next general election thanks to Keir’s leadership. This is no time for introspection.” Senior figures in the Labour leader’s team are understood to have felt reluctant to advise Starmer he should raise the prospect of his own resignation. On Friday, after finding out on Twitter that Durham constabulary intended to relaunch their investigation, Starmer told his core team of advisers he wanted to make the pledge to resign if fined and asked for their advice. Two of his closest advisers told him to sleep on it, and were not prepared to give him a strong fixed view, according to party sources. “It is fair to say Keir has not been getting the best advice he could and his own instincts were better,” one senior Labour source said. Starmer said he would not make an announcement on Saturday in order not to detract from the Scottish election results but was frustrated his team had been unable to form a clear view by Sunday afternoon when he returned from watching Arsenal. He began to ring friends – his former longtime aides Ben Nunn and Chris Ward, who left his team last year, as well as his inner circle of MPs, including Reeves. All of the shadow cabinet ministers and ex-advisers warned of the risk of fatal paralysis if he did not make the commitment. For now, his frontbenchers believe the heat is temporarily off. “It is frankly a statement of the obvious, which looks ballsy only because the PM has not been prepared to do the basic honourable thing,” one MP said. “Keir dug himself a big hole, and this was clearly the only way to get out of it,” another said. “Nevertheless it will make lots of people who don’t generally take much notice see him as a leader who is prepared to be decisive.”",News/Politics,Beergate: Labour MPs wary of internal manoeuvring after Starmer pledge,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/10/beergate-labour-mps-wary-internal-manoeuvring-starmer-pledge
5/11/2022,"The gambling regulator will ask a court to force through its award of the next national lottery contract to the Czech-owned newcomer Allwyn, in a move critics say risks depriving good causes of up to £800m. The Gambling Commission awarded the fourth national lottery licence to Allwyn earlier this year, triggering an immediate legal challenge from the incumbent Camelot and the media tycoon Richard Desmond, who also lost out in the competition for the lucrative licence. The losing bidders are taking their case to the high court in October, with the Gambling Commission barred from moving forward with preparations to transfer the licence to Allwyn in the meantime. On Wednesday, lawyers for the regulator will ask a high court judge to remove the temporary block that prevents it from signing an “enabling agreement” with Allwyn, which they will say risks delaying the transition and endangering payments to good causes. But a source familiar with the legal battle said it was the regulator’s haste to push through Allwyn’s licence that risked diminishing payments to charities and sporting institutions. They said the commission’s request to lift the block would, if successful, make it all but impossible to reverse the award to Allwyn, ultimately owned by the Czech billionaire Karel Komárek. Camelot, its technology supplier IGT and Desmond would still go ahead with legal challenges but would effectively be suing for damages, rather than for the decision to be overturned. The combined damages claim could cost the regulator up to £800m, they said, including costs incurred during the lengthy bid process. Camelot would also seek compensation for income it would have made from running the lottery between 2024 and 2034. “The Gambling Commission is essentially gambling with money meant for good causes,” said the source, adding that it would be more prudent for the commission to extend Camelot’s existing licence for a further six months, to allow the trial to go ahead. Should Camelot succeed in its challenge, it would then continue to operate the lottery and no damages would be paid. If it loses, the award to Allwyn would stand. The commission has granted Camelot a temporary extension before, when Sir Richard Branson launched an ultimately unsuccessful bid in 2000 to overturn a decision to give the Canadian-owned company the second national lottery licence. A spokesperson for Camelot declined to comment. A Gambling Commission spokesperson said: “We are confident that we have run a fair and robust competition. “The lottery is a national treasure and since launching in 1994 players have collectively raised more than £45bn for 660,000 good causes across the UK, transforming lives and contributing to the arts, sport, heritage and communities. “A delay to the implementation of the fourth licence poses a significant risk which could diminish funds going to these causes. The former Camelot chief executive Dame Dianne Thompson wrote to the commission last weekend warning it to abandon its attempt to move forward with Allwyn’s licence, to “avoid any unseemly and unnecessary haste in legal proceedings and remove the risk to good causes”.",News/UK news,National lottery: regulator will ask court to enforce Allwyn licence award,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/10/national-lottery-regulator-ask-court-enforce-allwyn-licence-award
5/11/2022,"Asked by the New York attorney general to turn over personal cellphones to aid her investigation of alleged fraud at his company, Donald Trump said he had lost them. In an affidavit filed as part of an attempt to stop the accrual of fines for non-compliance with subpoenas, a $10,000 daily penalty which has reached $150,000, the former president said: “I am not currently in possession of any Trump Organization-issued phones, computers or similar devices. “I believe the last phone or device I was issued by the Trump Organization was a cellphone in 2015. I no longer have the cellphone in my possession and I am not aware of its current location. “Since January 1, 2010, I previously owned two flip phones and a Samsung mobile phone. I do not have the two flips [sic] phones in my possession and I do not know their current whereabouts.” Trump said he took the Samsung with him to the White House when he was sworn in as president in 2017, but “it was taken from me at some point while I was president. I do not have the Samsung in my possession and I do not know its current whereabouts.” Trump also said he now owns “two personal mobile phones … an iPhone which I have owned for several years and is for my personal use [and] a new phone which I was recently given by Truth Social just last week”. Truth Social is Trump’s own social media platform, set up to counter what he claims to be censorship by Twitter and Facebook, which banned him after his supporters attacked the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. Trump has not been a prodigious poster of Truth Social, which has struggled. Nonetheless, in his affidavit, Trump said he used his new phone “exclusively for posting on Truth Social and no other purpose. I have never placed or received a call, sent or received a text message, or used this phone in any other manner.” Trump also said he submitted his iPhone to the New York investigation in late March, to be “searched and imaged”, then did so again in early May, “in an abundance of caution”. He added: “Since at least January 1, 2010, it has been my customary practice to not communicate via email, text message, or other digital methods of communication. I also do not use a computer for work-related purposes.” The civil investigation of Trump’s financial affairs in New York is only one form of legal jeopardy faced by the former president. In one high-profile case, a grand jury has been picked in Fulton county, Georgia, where a prosecutor is examining Trump’s attempts to overturn his defeat by Joe Biden in the southern state. Trump has said investigations of his financial and political affairs are politically motivated witch-hunts. Nonetheless, Trump’s affidavit and others filed by his lawyers in the New York case described extensive searches for devices and documents at the Trump Organization in New York, at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home in Florida and at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump’s claim to have lost his phones prompted widespread skepticism online. Preet Bharara, a former US attorney for the southern district of New York who famously refused to take a call from Trump before Trump fired him, wrote: “Let he who has never lost four cellphones cast the first stone.”",News/US news,Trump tells court he lost phones linked to alleged fraud by his company,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/10/trump-cellphones-investigation-alleged-fraud-company
5/11/2022,"Two years after a joint investigation by the Guardian and El País revealed the apparent use of Pegasus spyware to target senior pro-independence Catalan politicians, the Spanish government finds itself beset by internal and external cyber-espionage scandals that have led to the sacking of the country’s intelligence chief. Pegasus is spyware, manufactured by the Israeli NSO Group, which allows its operator to access everything on a target’s mobile phone, including emails, text messages and photographs. It can also activate the phone’s recorder and camera, turning it into a listening device. According to NSO Group, Pegasus is only sold to governments to track criminals and terrorists. Spain’s Socialist-led coalition government announced on Tuesday that it had fired Paz Esteban, the head of the national intelligence centre (CNI). The move came three weeks after Citizen Lab cybersecurity experts published a report alleging at least 63 people connected with the Catalan independence movement – including the current regional president, Pere Aragonès – were targeted or infected with Pegasus. The report said lawyers, journalists and civil society activists were also targeted. It has also emerged over the past week that the phones of three of Spain’s most senior politicians – the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, the defence minister, Margarita Robles, and the interior minister, Fernando Grande-Marlaska – were subjected to “illicit” and “external” targeting using Pegasus last year. The Spanish government described Esteban’s dismissal as a “substitution”, but has admitted there were shortcomings and failings at the CNI on her watch – not least the fact that the centre appears to have taken a year to discover the hacking of cabinet phones. Those are two big – and separate – questions. In June 2020, the Guardian and El País reported that at least three senior pro-independence Catalan politicians had been told their phones had been targeted using Pegasus. The attacks, thought to have been carried out in April and May 2019, came less than two years after the failed, illegal and unilateral bid for Catalan independence that plunged Spain into its worst political and territorial crisis for decades. One of those targeted at the time, the then speaker of the Catalan parliament, Roger Torrent, said he believed the “Spanish state” was responsible. The Spanish government vehemently denied the accusation, saying: “This government doesn’t spy on its political opponents.” The CNI gave a more guarded answer, saying its work was overseen by Spain’s supreme court and that it always acted “in full accordance with the legal system, and with absolute respect for the applicable laws”. The CNI’s involvement in spying on the Catalan independence movement was confirmed last week when Esteban appeared before the congressional official secrets committee and reportedly testified that 18 members of the regional independence movement – including Aragonès – were spied on with judicial approval. It is not clear from reports of Esteban’s testimony whether Aragonès was spied on before or after coming to his current position, nor whether the technology used in the 18 cases was Pegasus. According to its mission statement, the CNI’s job is to “prevent and avoid any danger, threat or attack against the independence or territorial integrity of Spain, its national interests, or the stability of the rule of law and its institutions”. Both the CNI and the government have repeatedly insisted that the law has always been adhered to and the appropriate judicial authorisation sought. According to the Spanish government, the phones of Sánchez, Robles and Marlaska were all targeted with Pegasus in May and June last year – a particularly turbulent time in Spanish politics. Not only was the Sánchez administration preparing its deeply divisive pardons of nine Catalan independence leaders jailed for their parts in the failed secession attempt in 2017, Spain was also engaged in a tense diplomatic row with Morocco. The government has refused to speculate on who may have been behind the attacks, saying only that they were “illicit” and “external” – meaning they were carried out by another country. The data leak at the heart of the Pegasus investigation revealed more than 200 Spanish mobile numbers were selected as possible targets for surveillance in 2019 by an NSO Group client believed to be Morocco, but Morocco has denied spying on any foreign leaders using Pegasus, and has said reporters were “incapable of proving [the country had] any relationship” with NSO. “While we have not seen any information related to this alleged misuse and we are not familiar with the details of this specific case, NSO’s firm stance on these issues is that the use of cyber tools in order to monitor politicians, dissidents, activists and journalists is a severe misuse of any technology and goes against the desired use of such critical tools.” “NSO continues to be targeted by a number of politically motivated advocacy organisations like Citizen Labs and Amnesty to produce inaccurate and unsubstantiated reports based on vague and incomplete information. We have repeatedly cooperated with governmental investigations, where credible allegations merit. However, information raised regarding these allegations are, yet again, false and could not be related to NSO products for technological and contractual reasons.” Sánchez’s minority government, which relies on Aragonès’s Catalan Republican Left (ERC) party for parliamentary support, has taken a far more conciliatory approach to the “Catalan question” than its conservative predecessor. While it has ruled out a referendum on regional independence, it has shown a willingness to discuss the matter and to negotiate. The latest spying revelations have severely dented the ERC’s trust in the Spanish government, but the party is pragmatic and may take Esteban’s dismissal as a welcome gesture by Sánchez. It also knows it has more political clout with the current left-leaning minority government in power than it would under a rightwing administration. On Tuesday, the leader of Spain’s conservative People’s party accused the prime minister of handing Esteban’s head to the independence movement to save his own political skin.",News/News,What we know about Spain’s cyber-espionage spyware scandals,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/may/10/what-we-know-about-spains-cyber-espionage-spyware-scandals
