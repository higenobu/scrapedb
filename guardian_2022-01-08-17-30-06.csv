1/8/2022,"The Hype House, a collective of some of TikTok’s most famous stars in the hills north-west of Los Angeles, appears to be a very lonely place even with somewhere around 10 residents between the ages of 17 and 23. Bird’s-eye shots of the house in its eponymous Netflix reality series – to date, arguably the most prominent attempt to translate TikTok fame to the formulas of major streaming platforms – capture a property of isolation and excess: a grandiose villa with a cluster of palm trees atop a barren, brown hill, an empty driveway save for a brightly painted school bus. Inside, a collection of social media influencers and creators – Instagram, YouTube and, most predominantly, TikTok – traipse about impersonally deluxe rooms trailed by a constant cloud of content. They’re either making some (planning, rehearsing, filming, being filmed), lamenting the pressure to do so, or avoiding the churn entirely in an anxious, bored malaise.  In confessionals which open the series and recur throughout the five episodes made available for review, the Hype House stars attempt to explain their fame, their jobs and the experience of being known by millions of people and having your worth — and income — quantified by followers. Like sisters Charli and Dixie D’Amelio, the TikTok stars and former Hype House collective members in Hulu’s Kardashian-esque The D’Amelio Show, and Gen Z music superstars Billie Eilish and Juice WRLD (who both blew up on Soundcloud) in their respective 2021 documentaries, the kids find the experience of social media fame basically inarticulable. “A million people who know who you are – it’s just … weird,” says 20-year-old Mia Hayward (3.7 million followers, the show notes; it’s unclear on what platform). “I don’t even know how this is my life. I don’t even know how this many people follow me, or even just care about me,” says Larri “Larray” Merritt (24.3 million followers). “It feels like a dream. I just posted a video on an app, now I’m living in a mansion,” said Jack Wright (8.1 million followers). “So you just woke up one day and became an internet celebrity?” an unseen producer asks Kouvr Annon, 20 (13.5 million followers). “Honestly? Kinda,” she responds. Hype House is the latest TikTok-adjacent content, to use the overused, air-quotable term, that tries to capture the “behind the scenes” dynamic of a life that is constantly on camera anyway. Like The D’Amelio Show, it’s a project whose aim seems unclear beyond the mandate of fame maintenance – is the point to turn the participants into mainstream stars? To reveal a more “authentic” experience of celebrity? To convince people to take the profession seriously? To be a fly on the wall? – whose interpersonal drama is at best half-hearted and whose stakes exist on an off-camera app. Both end up being intriguing not for the charisma of its stars, whose professional futures remain a constantly stressful question mark, but because they are human beings undergoing an ineffable, relentless experience of extremes, happening too fast and at too large a scale for anyone to process and which few people seem to actually enjoy. Hype House isn’t as deliberate with mental health messages as The D’Amelio Show, which is bookended by content warnings and resource lists and witnesses both girls have panic attacks. But it’s an effectively depressing portrait of one’s life as a voracious business. No one appears to be having a good time. The kids are constantly stressed out by the prospect of getting canceled (ie a scandal which prompts a flood of hate messages and sponsorship cancellations) and the lashings of toxic fans (such as when possessive female fans of heartthrob Vinnie Hacker, 18, post death threats for a girl whom he kissed as part of a prank video.) It is perhaps best described as a work-from-home reality show whose drama basically boils down to threatened income. The main plotline of the first few episodes is a rift between Hype House co-founder Thomas Petrou, the 22-year-old leader of the house, and Chase “Lil Huddy” Hudson, 18, a TikTok e-boy archetype perhaps most famous to outsiders for dating Charli D’Amelio, and who moved out before filming. Throughout the season, Petrou laments a lack of interest from the Hype House residents to post content, which keeps the business afloat. But the lethargy reads less like laziness than exhaustion and anxiety; the residents (mostly indistinguishable teenage boys) are hesitant to produce more cringey sponsorship videos, gin up plot for clicks, or mine themselves for more attention. Hudson, just barely out of high school, is openly done with TikTok, preferring to parlay his notoriety into a music career as a Green Day-esque alternative rocker. Hype House takes time to delineate the different lanes of internet fame each member has capitalized on and now finds themselves trapped by. Hudson is the charismatic tortured soul, sly and withdrawn. Alex Warren, 20 the YouTuber with expensive Jackass-lite style pranks perpetually stressed about finances (“your money depends on the numbers,” he says during a week of less-than-ideal viewers); with Annon, his girlfriend of over two years, he also produces aspirational “relationship content”. Nikita Nguyen, AKA Nikita Dragun, is a 25-year-old trans beauty Youtuber turned makeup mogul always in glam mode. Merritt, a YouTuber turned TikTok star from Compton, is the collective’s lone black member, dealing with fans’ charges of selling out or whitewashing. Hacker, the house’s star du jour at time of filming, is trying to convert his “thirst traps” (being hot and shirtless) into a following for livestreaming video games on Twitch. But this fame mostly lurks outside of the frame and in the psyche – there are barely any fans seen in this show in person; most of the real beef, such as an infamous Twitter feud between Nikita and fellow controversial YouTuber Trisha Paytas, or the Hype House’s notorious partying during the 2020 pandemic lockdowns in Los Angeles, is alluded to but not explored in depth. Stars might apologize briefly, but much more time is spent on their perception of the panopticon: feeling a need to apologize so constant and unreliable as to prompt numbness; trying to handle scandal by separating friends’ personal sides and “reputation sides”. Worrying about how to get fans to tune back in, how to tune out, how to stay positive. The Hype House, with its requirements of XYZ videos a month, comes off like a Faustian bargain: free living in exchange for control of your public persona. Despite everything, the status still elicits pride. “I worked my ass off to get here,” Michael Sanzone says to Hacker when the latter expresses lack of interest in the required collaborative videos. Hype House does effectively argue for how serious everyone takes the job. But it also implicitly asks the question: at what cost?

1/8/2022,"The myth: shaving your legs causes the hair to grow back thicker and darkerNope, says trichologist Anabel Kingsley. “Your hair is not like a lawn that is stimulated by cutting. If you cut your hair short, shave your head, legs or anywhere else, hair will not grow back thicker.” It’s the stubby length and squared-off (rather than naturally tapered) hair tips that give the illusion of greater thickness in regrowth – which is why regular trims make the hair on your head appear (falsely) denser and thicker. However, waxing legs (where hairs are pulled from the root, sometimes disrupting hair production) can in some cases cause hairs to grow back more sparsely. The myth: plucking grey hairs causes more to grow in their place  People are commonly warned that yanking out grey hairs will only cause multiples to appear at their funeral. If only, says Anabel Kingsley, who treats clients with hair thinning and alopecia: “It would be a great way to get thicker hair. Sadly, it isn’t. And pulling out hairs repeatedly can damage the follicle, creating areas of hair loss.” Kingsley says this oft-repeated myth is most likely perpetuated by the fact that the discovery of one grey hair usually results in a careful search for more. The myth: darker skins don’t need sunscreenIt isn’t just a myth that olive, brown and black skin needs no sunscreen – it’s a serious public health issue. While it’s true that rates of melanoma and other skin cancers are lower in Black and Asian populations, those that do occur tend to be diagnosed much later, lowering the survival rate. Dija Ayodele, skincare expert and author of Black Skin: the Definitive Skincare Guide, says people of colour must be diligent in their sun protection: “Because Black and darker skin tones are less likely to develop sun-induced skin cancer, the suncare market doesn’t engage with this demographic. Skin of colour should be included, with the explanation that, yes, melanin (more present in darker skin) gives protection, but it doesn’t mean you should be complacent and forgo sun protection completely.” Ayodele adds that the trend for modern chemical skin peels and the residual popularity of bleaching products, as well as a propensity towards hyper-pigmentation and discolouration in darker skins, is all the more reason to slather on the SPF. The myth: parabens are dangerous Nothing infuriates a beauty expert more than the belief, widely popularised by the “clean beauty” movement, that these common preservatives are a danger to health. Cosmetic scientist Sam Farmer is no exception: “Parabens are ingested by most people every day in fruit and vegetables. They are safe, found in nature, skin-friendly and a fantastic preservative. Saying all parabens are bad is a bit like saying all mushrooms are bad.” Farmer says that rather than protecting us from harm, the replacement of parabens may actually be putting consumers at risk: “The move away from parabens has led to all sorts of problems with their replacements. Recent product failures, particularly in the US, have led to people reporting mould growth in their cosmetics and led to product recalls.” The myth: washing hair too often is bad for itNot according to celebrity and fashion hairstylist Neil Moodie, who has worked with Kate Moss, Gemma Chan, Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer. “Haircare is all about your hair type,” he says. “Straight and fine hair needs to be washed more frequently, as the natural sebum from the scalp travels down the shaft more easily, giving the hair a flatter, oilier look and feel. Thicker, curlier, coiled or wavy hair can be left longer, allowing the oil more time to travel down to the tips and stop them drying out.” If you’re using gentle products, you can wash oilier hair as often as you like; drier hair will benefit from less frequent washing, to allow the natural oils time to travel down the shaft. Moodie says the regular users of styling products should also ramp up the shampooing, so they can’t build up and irritate the scalp or damage hair. For frequent washers, he recommends using an SLS/detergent-free shampoo to massage the scalp and root area, then a conditioner only on mid-lengths to ends. The myth: sunscreen makes us deficient in vitamin DMany have argued in recent years that our increased awareness around sun protection has led to widespread vitamin D deficiency. But many people living in Britain are already vitamin D-deficient, sunscreen or no sunscreen. Consultant dermatologist Sam Bunting says for most of us it’s a non-issue: “For the vast majority, there should be no concern with vitamin D levels [and sunscreen] because of ‘real-world application’ (what a regular person would slather on). But those who practise rigorous protection by wearing photo-protective clothing, hats, staying in the shade and applying sunscreen at the correct dose (2mg per sq cm), do have a higher risk, so oral supplementation is advised.” For others, sitting outside for a few minutes with unprotected forearms should top up vitamin D levels nicely, though dark-skinned people tend to require more exposure to generate the same amount of vitamin D. The myth: false lashes and extensions damage natural lashes Teresa Smith, the founder of I Love Lash salon in central London,encounters this belief constantly, and lays the blame at shoddy practitioners. “A skilled lash artist works meticulously, adding hand-crafted extensions to one natural lash at a time,” she says. “I’m always mindful of the length and thickness of the lashes applied, to ensure they’re not too heavy/long and that they’re properly isolated, to allow the natural lashes to continue growing healthily without any irritation.” Extensions or none, she believes lash maintenance begins at home: “Scrubbing off mascara every day is damaging to the natural lashes.” Instead, gently stroke lashes with cleanser or remover. “I often see clients’ natural lash health improve with extensions, because they encourage wearers to be gentler.” The myth: you can’t use active skincare ingredients when you’re pregnantInformation on skincare during pregnancy, particularly those with active ingredients such as vitamin C, Bs and ingredient du jour niacinamide (found in meat, poultry, fish, nuts and vegetables), is among the most conflicting and confusing online. Doctor and aesthetician Ahmed El Muntasar provides clarity: “You can absolutely use actives when you’re pregnant, and actually a lot of my clients who get botox and filler with me pre-pregnancy move on to some form of active when pregnant to retain skin glow and vibrancy.” There are a couple of exceptions, he says: “With retinol and salicylic acid, there is a theoretical risk of developing issues with the pregnancy around haemorrhages and development of the placenta and the foetus. These products have not been tested in pregnancy, because that isn’t possible, but in lab studies and in theory the risk is there, so we err on the side of caution.” The myth: never pluck your own eyebrows This isn’t entirely true, but expert Shavata Singh, CEO and founder of Shavata Brows, does believe DIY brows should be a case of knowing one’s limitations. “The best thing anyone can do is to begin by getting a professional to create the ideal brow shape for you, then follow their design at home, by tweezing away stragglers,” she says. You will naturally lose your shape over time as fine hairs grow in, but this method will mean less-frequent appointments. If you must shape at home, Singh suggests drawing in your design with a brow pencil, not straying too far from the natural shape (anything below the arch is fair game), before picking up the tweezers. Avoid plucking from above, and take care not to overdo it. The myth: your skin gets used to skincare and it stops workingThis can be debunked by looking at ingredients with substantial and expansive long-term clinical findings (known as “long-term follow-up studies”). Consultant dermatologist Dr Jason Thomson from the Skin+Me service, says: “Tretinoin, the most active form of retinoid, is a prescription-only medicine and the best studied of all the retinoids. Studies have been done where people have used tretinoin regularly for one to four years, and these have shown that clinical improvements (as well as improvements seen under a microscope from biopsies) are seen over long periods and the benefits actually increase over time.” So it seems the theory of “overfamiliarity” carries little weight. Thomson says: “Studies give us evidence that the opposite is true and they form the basis for dermatologists’ advice that consistency is key with skincare. Sticking to ingredients that have proven benefits is the best approach, not chopping and changing your products and routine.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Shaving your legs won’t make your hair thicker: 10 beauty myths busted,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/08/10-beauty-myths-busted-shaving-legs-hair-thicker-false-lashes-sali-hughes
1/8/2022,"Olly Alexander bounds down the stairs of his flat to greet me with a hug. It’s a big flat, stretched over two floors, huge windows overlooking a pretty London park. There are books everywhere, in scattered, haphazard piles; he is just about to start Two Serious Ladies by Jane Bowles, a gift from a friend. There’s a Joni Mitchell songbook propped up on his piano, and there are massive houseplants all over the place. He left his old flat, not too far from here, after several lockdowns, because it didn’t have any outdoor space. This one, which has a huge balcony, is rented, so he didn’t buy the furniture, but the plants are his. “I’m a plant gay,” he quips, drily. Alexander has a puppyish energy. He is lively and charming and clearly very sensitive. On his sofa, he curls his legs underneath him, his trademark red hair (he once told Rihanna she inspired it) tucked under a baseball cap on which is printed Business of Pleasure. He is fun and chatty and acutely self-aware: he was in the audience for the Adele ITV live special recently, among an extraordinary buffet of celebrities, and he serves up good gossip about a couple of them, doing a brief, uncanny impression of Mel B. Boy George was sitting near him, which leads us on to The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, a reality show that Boy George appears in and that Alexander became obsessed with during lockdown. “I won’t go on and on about The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, even though I could … ” he says – and then he does.  Fame fascinates Alexander, and it also seems to repel him. Throughout our conversation, he treats it like a puzzle he is trying to solve. Now 31, he has had a fair taste of it, both as a singer and an actor. From the age of 18, he was an actor on the up, appearing in, among other things, Skins, and Peter and Alice in the West End, alongside Dame Judi Dench and Ben Whishaw. When he was 20, he joined the band Years & Years and became a pop star. Years & Years – of which he is now the only member, more on which shortly – sell out arena tours, win awards, and have topped the album and singles charts. He has done Celebrity Gogglebox with his mum, Vicki. In 2021, he performed with Elton John at the Brits. The weekend after we meet, he performs his new single live on Strictly Come Dancing. But at the end of 2019, he returned to acting, playing lead character Ritchie in the phenomenal drama It’s a Sin, which came out in early 2021. Ritchie is a young man who moves to London and hits the gay scene just as Aids arrives in the UK. We watch as tragedy after tragedy unfolds over the course of a decade. The show captured joy as well as pain, though, and Alexander’s impish spirit fed into Ritchie’s outlandishness and vulnerability. He has just been nominated for a US Critics’ Choice TV award for best actor in a limited series, for which he will compete with Paul Bettany and Michael Keaton. It has been quite the acting comeback. But he hasn’t acted since It’s a Sin, and now he’s here with a third Years & Years album, written during lockdown and recorded solo. He found lockdown hard, he explains, though he is careful to point out that, relatively speaking, he had an easy time of it. But he was living alone; he suddenly stopped working for the first time in years, and felt the weight of what he describes as “the world imploding”. Normally, he loves his own company. “I actually crave alone time. But then having all of it in one go was just … it was quite overwhelming,” he says. Alexander has been frank about his mental health in the past. In 2017, he made a moving, raw documentary for BBC Three called Growing Up Gay, in which he talked about mental health in the LGBTQ+ community, and shared his own experiences of being bullied and feeling ashamed of who he is. He talked about bulimia and self-harm, some of which was news to his mother, who heard about it for the first time on camera. He is something of an open book, I note. “I know! It’s all out there. I just think, ‘God, there’s nothing else I can say.’ It’s a compulsion, I think, more than anything else. Not to pathologise it or anything.” Alexander made a decision to be honest about who he was from the very beginning, when people first started to pay attention to Years & Years. “If people are going to ask about sexuality or mental health, then what am I going to say? If you’re honest, you don’t have anything to hide. Everyone deals with it differently, but I thought, ‘OK, I’ll try that.’” Just before Years & Years released their debut album in 2015, Alexander, then a rarity as an out male pop star clearly singing about men, expressed his sadness that there weren’t more like him. While there hasn’t exactly been an avalanche of male-on-male love songs, Lil Nas X, the singer and rapper who is gay and who gave the devil a lapdance in his video for Montero, has ascended to the pop throne and is now one of the biggest pop stars in the world. Does Alexander think there has been a shift? “When Lil Nas X went to No 1, I literally felt like running down the street naked, screaming in celebration, because it was such a huge moment for me,” he says. “I had begun to think, ‘God, will it ever happen? Will we ever get someone that is this huge crossover star, who’s gay?’ I just think it’s incredible, what he’s done. I’m in awe.” After 10 years together, Years & Years have gone from being a three-piece, comprised of Alexander, Mikey Goldsworthy and Emre Türkmen, to a solo act. But rather than start releasing music under his own name, Alexander has kept the Years & Years moniker. “I just didn’t want to let Years & Years go. I put so much into it. It was a tricky decision in some ways, because I think, possibly, it might have been a bit simpler for everyone if I had just been like, ‘Oh, I’m a solo artist now.’ But I just didn’t want to.” The official line is that the split was amicable. “The new album has been an Olly endeavour and we’ve decided that Years & Years will continue as an Olly solo project,” read a statement put out by the band last March, adding: “The three of us are still good friends.” Goldsworthy will be playing live with Alexander when the band goes on tour. But band break-ups are rarely so clean. “Bands are like marriages,” Alexander says. “Any separation is difficult, and I think it went as well as it could, with us.” He first joined Years & Years in 2010, and there is a strong sense that he was calling the shots from the beginning. “They didn’t really have a singer. And I came in, and I was like, ‘No, I’m the singer, I’ll be writing songs.’ So you can see, over that trajectory, perhaps this was sort of inevitable.” By the time of their second album, Palo Santo, in 2018, Alexander’s red hair had arrived. He was starting to become more pop star than indie-pop star, and it became clear that the band had different ideas about what their music would sound like. “Early on, we were more or less on the same ship, trying to steer in the same direction, and then just clearly we weren’t any more.” He sighs. “It was definitely the best thing for us, to go our separate ways, rather than try to make it work.” Which different directions had you all started to go in? “Well, I love pop music. I wanted us to play our song on The X Factor, for instance. Not that that ever happened – we didn’t get booked. But that was a huge issue within the group, because that felt like it would be too pop, and that being on TV like that was kind of lame.” There were the familiar “musical differences”, too. “When you think of a band, you imagine them all together in a house making music and coming up with ideas like that. But that was never how we did it. It was always quite separate, and then you figure out a way where you all feel good about it. After the first album, we never felt good about anything as a band. That’s when it all started, really.” He says he was proud of Palo Santo. “But it was not loved by everyone in the band, and that was hard for me.” The three of them still got on well enough to go on tour and have a good time, he says. “And obviously, I don’t want to speak for them, because I can’t.” But it sounds as if the split wasn’t a huge surprise. “It was coming for a long time.” Around the time that Years & Years were coming apart, he was making It’s a Sin in Manchester. It was an experience he loved, but one that was, he says, incredibly intense. For one thing, during a short break in filming, over Christmas 2019, his grandmother Rosemarie died. She had been a singer in her youth: she was a chorus girl who went to New York to perform and had a few leading roles on stage. She was his mother’s mother, and they were extremely close. “I was with her when she died, and then went back to work, and then came off that, and then the pandemic felt like it happened straight away. I hadn’t processed my gran’s death, really. And then I was thinking, ‘Oh my God, I’m trying to make this pop album. What’s the point? What is actually the point? Does anyone need another pop album? Not really.’” He giggles nervously. “I was having all those thoughts.” Then he turned 30, in July 2020, just as the first set of lockdown restrictions began to ease. “Maybe it sounds a bit silly, but it really felt like quite an achievement, to be 30. When you’re younger, you don’t ever imagine you’ll get to 30.” It felt, to him, like the first “big age”. Once he’d passed 25, he started to realise that he liked himself a bit more. “I was feeling like, ‘OK, maybe something is working here. I may finally be able to be a bit more at peace with myself and have a more solid foundation.’ And in terms of feeling like I’m too old, I felt too old when I was 27, 28, and coming back with the second Years & Years album. I found the transition from being ‘the young one’ really hard. I was looking at other pop stars who were in their early 20s, and I was thinking, ‘Oh my God, I’m ageing out of this. Like, I’m too old!’” I can’t help but laugh; he is still the picture of youth. “I know! It’s crazy. But that’s how it felt. Like, ‘Oh no, I’m past it!’” That feeling has quietened down. He celebrated his 30th with a trip to the treetop rope-bridge experience Go Ape, of all places (“the perfect thing for me: activity, outdoors, slightly scary”) and a nice meal, and he is much more comfortable with himself. “I feel so much more at peace with myself than I ever did,” he nods. “I’m just holding on to that feeling.” Why is that? “Time helps, you know.” He pauses, then adds, with a cackle, “And I’ve had a lot of therapy.” Eventually, Alexander decided that even if the world didn’t need another pop album, he was going to make one. Night Call sounds as if it burst out of lockdown. There are no slowies, no ballads, only bangers. “All I wanted to make was uptempo music you could dance to in a club,” he says. It’s a tribute to nightlife and freedom, and the sex that can go with it. On one song, he sings about “All that muscle, getting me into trouble … ” Another, 20 Minutes, celebrates the joy of a fleeting sexual encounter. “A lot of the songs are about sex and hookups because it was something that was absent from my life,” he says, laughing. “I was trying to manifest some physical contact and thinking about the past few years before lockdown. It’s not like I was having tons of sex, but I was having some sex.” He found that he was inspired by the different ways in which people express desire, including himself. “I thought, I can write songs about this.” He pauses on the edge of saying something, trying to work out whether he should or not, then decides to jump off. “But I have to say, um, that I’m lucky that I do have someone that I like – love, actually – a lot. Who loves me back.” He claps his hands, joyfully. “So that’s nice!” Is it a new thing? “It’s not actually a new thing. I’ve known him for six, seven years, I think. Over that time, we’ve called our relationship different things, if that makes any sense. And now we don’t have a name for it. But he really supports me. Over the past year, I’ve really leaned on him a lot. I’m going to be super private about him, but that’s part of my story, so I have to say it.” Is he your boyfriend? “I’m just not … ” Defining it? “I’m not defining it.” To me, or in general? “I mean, we talk about this kind of thing a lot, but it’s like the word is too much, or something, so I’m not going to put it out there.” So the hookups you’re singing about on the album are a past life? “No. I mean, I still hope to hook up again, some day,” he grins. “We’re not in that situation.” We both start to laugh. “It’s complicated, isn’t it, all that stuff?” Night Call is about dancing and shagging and hedonism. You can practically feel the sticky floor underfoot when you listen to it. “What I love so much about dance music and disco is that idea of liberation on the dancefloor. It’s communal, you come together and feel free, to the beat,” he says. In some ways, I suggest, it feels like a companion piece to It’s a Sin. “Definitely. It became super-present in my head,” he says. Russell T Davies, who wrote and created It’s a Sin, says he only auditioned one actor for the part of Ritchie, and that was Alexander. Davies is about to return to Doctor Who as its showrunner, but before that was announced, Alexander found himself on the front page of the Sun, being announced as the new Doctor. How did that happen? “It genuinely was news to me, I promise you,” he says. We gossip for a bit, off the record, but he insists he isn’t doing it. “I definitely am not Doctor Who, and I’m not going to be Doctor Who,” he says. I fix him with a stare. “Promise!” Really? “It’s not happening! I can tell you I’m definitely not doing it.” In It’s a Sin, Ritchie moves to London from the Isle of Wight to become an actor, and arrives with gusto on the city’s gay scene, partying and sleeping his way around town. When Aids begins to tear through his social circle, he is in denial, at one point giving a petulant speech accusing the government of fear-mongering and trying to stop gay men having sex. He values his freedom as a gay man; he votes for Thatcher. He is afraid and he is defiant. He is a complicated character, which makes his story all the more affecting. It feels authentic. Given that Alexander moved to London (from Gloucestershire) at 18 to become an actor, there are parallels, aren’t there? “For sure. Except he’s a fucking Tory,” he jokes. “I’m so angry at Russell! Making me play a Tory on TV.” What does he think Davies saw in him? “I don’t know. But it’s not often you see a character that’s so connected to your life that’s gay, that had these big ambitions, that was hiding something from the people around him. I felt all of those things. So I thought, ‘Oh yeah, I could do this. I can get into his head.’” He put acting on the back burner for Years & Years, and hadn’t acted for six years when It’s A Sin came along. He was intimidated. “I just thought, ‘What have I got myself in for, thinking I could do this?’ I was doing well as an actor, but I had never read something like It’s a Sin. You could wait your whole career and not get something as good as that, so I was like, ‘I have to do it, and do a good job.’” The reaction made it clear that he pulled it off. The programme won over critics and audiences in the UK and in the US. Unsurprisingly, for a drama about the Aids crisis in Britain, one that so tenderly and furiously memorialised the lives that were lost, it was devastating. Alexander often cried while reading the script and when learning his lines. “I know a lot of us on set felt the same. So I suppose it isn’t surprising that some people were similarly affected by watching it, or had an intense response. I hadn’t realised how much of a shadow it had been for lots of people, and the need they had to cast some light on it and say, ‘I was there, I remember it.’” He was born in 1990; it wasn’t his world. By playing Ritchie, he was just bearing witness to it. “But what to do next with that? I don’t really know.” Alexander says that at times he found the public reaction to It’s a Sin “overwhelming”. “My favourite word,” he smiles, a little sadly. “I felt like maybe some of what people experienced watching the show, I went through it in my own way, just by learning more about the history, because there were huge gaps in my knowledge of what happened in the UK in the 80s. That was a really deep, profound experience for me, as a human, but also as a gay man. It felt like it contextualised a lot of my experiences growing up.” Even now, Alexander still gets messages from people who have seen Growing Up Gay and identified with the struggles he went through as a young, closeted teenager who was bullied at school. It is a powerful film that distills complicated ideas about shame and internalised homophobia, for example, into a deceptively breezy format. “I’m glad you say that because obviously these things are so complicated and so different for everyone,” he says. “It’s so weird to be in a position of spokesperson or representative in any way of my community, as a gay man. You bump up against so many issues, like representation politics. But I think if you can give people some of the foundations of an idea or concept or a way to discuss something, even if it’s just an opening, then people can do the rest themselves. That’s a good thing, I think.” I wonder if the documentary is similar to It’s a Sin, in terms of it opening him up to hear about other people’s pain? “Mmm,” he says. “It’s hard, sometimes. I’m just trying to figure out a way of answering you and not crying myself, right now.” But he starts to cry, anyway. “This is what I mean, when it’s overwhelming, because you see how much people are in pain,” he says, his voice wobbling. “It’s sad to see that. And obviously I am someone that feels that stuff, too. And it just comes out like this.” I give him a hug. “Sorry,” he smiles. “It happens a lot. Like, in every interview, to be honest.” It’s not just me? “Don’t think you’re special!” He composes himself, carries on. “You know, I do these quite big, exposing things. Like, even It’s a Sin, obviously I’m playing a character, but then I have to really step back from it.” How does he do that? “I think of it happening slightly separately to me. It’s all part of something that is connected to me, but it’s all part of something else as well. And I still can’t quite figure that out. But that feels so much larger than me, Olly, and what I can contain in my brain, day to day.” Pop star duties are calling Alexander. He has Years & Years CDs on his kitchen table that he needs to sign, some social media posts to do to promote his latest single. I ask if he’ll return to acting soon. He hesitates. “I think I will, yeah,” he says. “When it’s something I want to do.” But he doesn’t exactly sound desperate to do it. “I know! Haha. I’m not, really. It’s such a bizarre job. And I feel like I left it behind for a reason, to make music and do Years & Years. It’s a Sin reminded me of how incredible that circus can be, so it would be fun to do again. But I’m just going to wait until it’s the right thing. Or make my own thing, at some point.” What would you make? “Like a queer horror thing? I love horror. Something in the vein of Twin Peaks, or Mulholland Drive.” Alexander once said that he had planned out his life until he was 25. Is there a new plan in place now? “No plan any more,” he says easily, but then he changes his mind. “Actually, have you seen Grace and Frankie?” He’s talking about the Netflix show starring Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin. “I just love their setup. They’re two women who are best friends living in this gorgeous place by the sea, in their 80s, still having sex, getting stoned and getting up to all sorts of trouble.” He grins. “My vague plan is to end up with something like that.”  Night Call will be released on 21 January.",Arts/Culture,"Olly Alexander on hope, hedonism and hook-ups: ‘If you’re honest, you don’t have anything to hide’ ",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/08/olly-alexander-on-hope-hedonism-and-hook-ups-if-youre-honest-you-dont-have-anything-to-hide
1/8/2022,"Scotland’s mountain rescue teams have begun using sophisticated drones to search for injured and missing climbers lost in often dangerous and isolated terrain across the Highlands. The drones, weighing just under a kilo, can be fitted with torches, heat-detecting cameras, loudspeakers and even radio handsets, enabling rescuers to search inaccessible gullies and remote areas more quickly and safely than before.  The technology has been quickly taken up by Scotland’s 28 volunteer rescue teams over the last year, helping in recent searches for casualties and missing people on Ben Nevis, the southern uplands, in Fife and the Trossachs. Drone experts believe the devices could soon act as emergency mobile phone masts, providing coverage deep in the mountains, over moors and remote coasts, allowing rescue teams to detect signals from missing walkers or link up rescuers in mobile dead zones. “The drones are definitely an asset, there’s no doubt about it,” said John Stevenson, a team leader for Lochaber mountain rescue team in Fort William, which covers Ben Nevis and now operates four drones. “We’re putting drones into places where years ago we might have thought twice about putting people in.” Tom Nash, the founder of the Search and Rescue Aerial Association Scotland (Saraa), a charity that trains drone pilots, said the technology had the potential to transform rescues and search operations. In 2020 the 24 teams that were members of Scottish Mountain Rescue had 671 callouts. “Risk reduction is a key use of a drone. Previously where someone has needed to do a rope rescue or a stretcher lift, you would have some poor person dangling over the edge of a cliff, roped back, peering over saying ‘I think we should put the rope down here’,” Nash said. “Well now, just put the drone 20 yards out the other side of the cliff and look back, you can see where the casualty is. And our rope experts can say ‘our safest rope line is here down to here’. You can floodlight that at night. We can put a speaker on and if we know it’s going to be a while, we can speak to the casualty and say help is on the way, ‘give us a thumbs up if you’re OK but can’t move’. That’s a really critical use.” A former RAF Tornado navigator who became a commercial drone operator, Nash has helped train 15 volunteers with eight rescue teams across Scotland to become qualified drone pilots. Saraa has six operational drones of its own and in 2020 had four callout requests for drone support; in 2021 that jumped to 15. Separately, rescue teams such as Glen Coe and Lochaber have their own equipment. Nash and Stevenson said there were limitations: drones cannot be used in rain, snow or fog. There are legal height restrictions and they are limited currently to line of sight, meaning a pilot has to be able to see the craft. Rescue teams also, at present, keep their drones on the ground if a search and rescue helicopter is involved. But Lochaber has learned they can be programmed to carry out systematic searches across a hillside far faster than a search team on foot, allowing rescue coordinators to study the footage back at base. “They’re terrific. You can get a bird’s eye view of where you are,” said Stevenson. His team had seen them used by French rescue teams operating on Alpine ski slopes. Nash said their roles could expand as pilots’ skills and the technology improve. Nash said they could copy the communications firm OpenReach, which uses drones fitted with 4G phone equipment to “drape” mobile coverage over a large area when phone masts are out of action. In time, drones could be able to deliver supplies and equipment to casualties or rescue teams in difficult terrain. “It’s so exciting because it can and will revolutionise things,” he said.",News/UK news,Flying to the rescue: Scottish mountain teams are turning to drones,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/08/flying-to-the-rescue-scottish-mountain-teams-are-turning-to-drones
1/8/2022,"My boyfriend and I are standing on a pile of manure-smelling, clay-thick earth, tentatively licking a plant root. “Is that peppery?” I run my tongue over my teeth. “I think it might be peppery?”  “I can’t taste anything,” my boyfriend says, treading on a courgette seedling. “Let’s take it home, anyway,” I reply, wiping muddy hands down my thighs. “We could always just boil it.” It’s easy to be good at things: the praise, the sense of instant satisfaction, the positive reinforcement. It’s harder, and altogether more rewarding, to be bad at things. I am really quite bad at having an allotment. We took on our 10 poles’ worth (I am told that this is a standard allotment size, dating back to Anglo-Saxon times) last winter. We weren’t the only ones. Unsurprisingly, interest in allotments soared during the first lockdown. According to the National Allotment Society, 40% of English councils reported a “significant uplift” in applications, while it experienced a 45% increase in requests for information through its website. But growing vegetables – if you haven’t done it much before – isn’t always terribly easy. My boyfriend and I planted a couple of tomato seedlings during a hot spell in April. They were effectively burned to death in less than three days. I hadn’t thought to water them each evening, being somewhat preoccupied by watering my three-year-old son. We planted a gooseberry bush atop a red ants’ nest: tending it was both spicy on the knees and pretty pointless: the ants soon infested the root system. I cut back a grapevine left by the previous owner as the sap was rising, possibly killing off large sections. Our pièce de résistance has been the free shed a saintly member of the allotment committee members provided us. At the time of writing, the shed lists, its roof wrapped in tarpaulin and its door nailed shut in order to stop it swinging open. There’s a guy who owns a plot two down, who got his allotment at the same time as ours. He’s already ploughed it over, producing mountains of sweetcorn, tomatoes, chard and potatoes. He built a series of metal structures, like an electricity substation, to grow beans and peas along, and scored out verges so straight you could tear paper on them. We, by contrast, have put up a large plastic children’s slide, found a rats’ nest under a pile of wood, and at one point were watering the whole thing with a child’s beach bucket. During late summer, when we were made temporarily homeless by the madness of the British housing system and delays in a chain, we managed to grow eight pumpkins. It’s a strange thing to have no fixed abode – to be sleeping on your dad’s kitchen floor – while simultaneously owning a patch of huge orange pumpkins. We started to leave them behind as thank-you presents for people who let us house-sit. My aunt took one back to London sitting on the passenger seat of her car like a cultivated squash co-pilot. But the thing is, I love it. I love it precisely because we’re bad at it. Everything is new; everything is an experiment; everything is hard physical work, and therefore rewarding. As I sit on an upturned bucket, drinking coffee from a vacuum flask, looking out across the tangle of weeds, I feel utterly content. Even when I’m failing. I love the pitying looks other allotment owners give us as they slowly walk past, on their way to their unbelievably fecund sites. I love that our allotment neighbours – an elderly couple who shout at each other in Urdu from either end of their plot – give us pity bunches of coriander. I love that my son can entertain himself for a few hours doing nothing more productive than cutting grass with a pair of scissors. I love it because it’s good to be bad at things sometimes. In order to learn how to do something new, you have to be rubbish at it first. You make mistakes, lose heart, forget your plans and see what works. And then, plough on.

1/8/2022,"Black women are notoriously underserved by the US healthcare system. The New York City-based founders of the digital platform Health in Her Hue aim to bridge that gap. Since its launch in 2018, the platform has empowered Black women with the community and resources to find supportive, culturally sensitive care.  Last summer, co-founders Ashlee Wisdom (chief executive) and Eddwina Bright (chief operating officer) secured $1m in pre-seed funding, marking a turning point in their startup’s success story. “Fundraising is never a walk in the park, especially as Black women,” says Wisdom. “No matter how credentialed you are, it’s hard for everyone. But then you add on the layer of the fact that there aren’t many Black women who are building venture-backed companies or get funding. We’ve experienced some challenges throughout that journey.” Now, the co-founders are in “build mode”. With their funding, the pair are working to develop a new web platform and membership experience, which will offer care support and resources tailored to each woman’s specific healthcare needs. “Ultimately, our vision for Health in Her Hue is to be the first touchpoint for women of color managing their healthcare,” Wisdom says. Take us back to the beginning. What led you to launch Health in Her Hue, back in 2018? Ashlee Wisdom: At that time, two things were happening: I was working in a toxic work environment, and I was breaking out in chronic hives. So I was going to see an allergist, who happened to be a white woman. She was a great doctor, but because we didn’t have that shared identity, it never occurred to me to tell her that I was dealing with racism and discrimination at work. So long story short, she was running all these tests on me and I wasn’t allergic to anything. We couldn’t figure out what was triggering the hives. After I left the job, I realized that they were related to that stressful, toxic work environment. That got my wheels turning, and made me realize that I shared much more with my Black gynecologist. If I was more transparent and felt more comfortable sharing the full picture of what was going on in my life, that allergist would’ve been able to get to the root cause of what was triggering my hives. At the same time, I was getting my master’s in public health, and got really tired of reading research papers about the disparate healthcare outcomes for Black women. And so I decided I wanted to do something to support Black women and women of color to better manage their health and also better navigate the US healthcare system. Eddwina Bright: I think our first foray into working with together was when Ashlee was doing a video series on maternal health and asked me to share my birthing story – at that point, we knew each other socially. My experience giving birth to my oldest was not great. I felt very much coaxed into a C-section; doctors were not answering my questions, not telling my husband anything. It was just not a great experience. And so from that, I was able to take a step back and find a provider that was more culturally aligned with me. So when it came time to have my second child, I felt seen, I felt heard, I felt taken seriously, and was able to really advocate for myself and have a much better birthing experience. So that’s the passion that I bring to the work that we do. I’d like us to help the women that we serve to advocate for themselves without having to go through really traumatic healthcare experiences. And the company happens to align with my professional experience in finance and nonprofit entrepreneurship. So we definitely have a great balance of health and business expertise. At what point did you realize that this business was making a real impact, and achieving what you hoped it would? Wisdom: From 2018 up until 2020, like right before the pandemic hit, we were building the community and seeing great feedback from women. But the resounding thing we kept hearing was that it’s difficult to find a Black doctor, or a doctor of color, on existing platforms. So that was the impetus to build out a curated directory of Black physicians across the country. When we launched that directory in June 2020 – given the pandemic and the racial reckoning – people were ready. 34,000 people logged in within the first week or two. Bright: Separately, we also had articles and videos that people could engage with on our website, as well as a community forum where women could talk to each other. So we brought all of those components together to continue the momentum, and realized we had tens of thousands of women in our community. We only had six doctors at first, and now we have more than 1,000. What do you envision for the future of Health in Her Hue? Wisdom: We really want to continue to grow and expand the community so that Health in Her Hue is the go-to, safe space for women of color for all things health care-related. That’s my overarching big vision for what we’re building. Bright: I completely 100% agree. I’d love for us to also become a resource for Bipoc women to better navigate not only their individual health, but the health of their families: their kids, their spouse, their parents. Because we know that community health is very important for the collective. I would also like us to help support the talent pipeline of culturally sensitive health care providers. Maybe that means helping with scholarships and internships, putting students into doctor’s offices and teaching them the business of medicine. That’s a major gap in the market, which I’d love to see us fill.",News/Business,"‘I felt seen, I felt heard’: platform links Black women to supportive healthcare ",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/08/health-in-her-hue-platform-healthcare-business
1/8/2022,"“It’s not very straightforward – it’s not something that you’ll find every day,” Mario Marinica says. But the Romania-born British citizen, who is set to manage Malawi at the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon – his team kick off against Naby Keïta’s Guinea on Monday – wants to explain why a turn of events that feels bizarre is actually all perfectly normal. It was on 6 December that the Football Association of Malawi announced it had reorganised and placed Marinica in interim charge of the team for the 33rd edition of Africa’s showpiece tournament. The organisation had hired the 57-year-old on 10 November as technical director and so the move represented a radical change in his remit.  And yet the twist was that the previous manager, Meck Mwase, would remain as the first assistant coach – an effective demotion – before resuming his old role after the finals. That will be when Marinica goes back to being the technical director. It begs a host of questions, beginning with how Mwase feels about it. “To be honest, he’s a very nice guy and he kind of embraced it,” Marinica says. “I had a good chat with him and said: ‘Please come and help us.’ It might be like a temporary demotion but he still has a contract and the terms are that he will get back to being the head coach again so it’s just for this tournament that I’m helping out. In a way, he was content with this arrangement.” The next question is broader but similarly simple. Why? It is because, shortly after Marinica’s appointment, Mwase’s team had lost to Cameroon and Mozambique to round off a failed World Cup qualifying campaign, featuring one win and five defeats. The Malawian FA called the performance “dismal” and, by the time that its executive committee met in early December to finalise Afcon plans, it had listened to sustained calls for Mwase’s dismissal. Marinica was there to report on his first month in the job, his findings and concerns, having spent a lot of time with Mwase travelling the country, watching the main clubs and analysing the players. To the executives, the most novel of solutions was starring them in the face. “They were saying it was too short a time [before the tournament] to bring in another coach and it was: ‘Well, Mario is already here and he knows the teams and the players …’” Marinica says. Marinica’s original brief was to reboot football in Malawi from top to bottom, prioritising the technical side of the game, the development of a clear footballing identity. He has a three-year contract because everybody knows it will not happen overnight. And yet, as the FA president, Walter Nyamilandu, has said, Malawi are “not just going there [to Afcon] to add numbers”. On their third appearance at the finals, after the group stage exits of 1984 and 2010, he wants to see a better-organised team, with Marinica introducing a new style, quicker and more cohesive, which Mwase can then take on. And he wants results. Marinica had a 10-day training camp in Saudi Arabia, which was affected by positive Covid tests. Some players could not travel, others joined late and more were infected after it began, forcing them to isolate. A friendly with Mali had to be cancelled, although they did fit one in against Comoros on New Year’s Eve, winning 2-1. In a word, how would Marinica describe the preparations? “Fantastic,” he insists. “All your life, you work to have something like this and suddenly, when it comes unexpectedly, you have to embrace it with both hands. To have this opportunity, to be with all this razzmatazz, it’s a dream come true. These are the big stages that any coach wants to be on.” Marinica moved to England in 1992. Aged 27, he had a degree and a good job in Romania as the head of a large transport and distribution company. “I was really well settled,” he says. But his dream was to become a football coach and he saw England as the place to realise it. Marinica’s break came after he took his first coaching badge. The tutor was John Sitton, best known for his spells as a player and manager at Leyton Orient. “Only two of us passed and John said to me: ‘Well, if you want, you’ve got a job at Orient.’ I worked for them on and off for something like seven years. It was football in the community courses, all sorts of jobs, helping with coaches. It put me on to my coaching path.” It has been itinerant, to put it mildly. In England, Marinica has coached at the academies of Arsenal and Crystal Palace – primarily at under-15 level – although his work as a coach educator for the London FA took him, by his own estimation, into “every single one” of the clubs in the capital. He had two stints as the manager of non-league Haringey Borough while he accumulated his coaching badges, finishing with the Uefa Pro Licence. In Romania, there have been technical roles at numerous clubs and he has worked across Africa – in Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Seychelles, Tunisia, Tanzania. He has coached in Hungary and Iraq and he provided analysis for Paraguay on their opponents at the 2006 World Cup. Before Malawi, he was the technical director of the Kerala Blasters in India. “Oh my God, there have been so many different jobs – I’ll probably have to write you a list,” Marinica says, and the feeling is that the aforementioned does not cover it. “Life has taken me from working with Paraguay for the 2006 World Cup to going to Brazil to lecture on coaching courses before the 2014 World Cup. In England, to mention some odd jobs … a little something with Watford, Fulham, Charlton, Wimbledon, Stockport, Notts County.” Now for the pinnacle. After Guinea, Malawi face Zimbabwe and the bookmakers’ favourites for the tournament, Senegal, and they begin as major underdogs. Marinica intends to have his day.",Sport/Football,‘It is a dream’: Mario Marinica’s bizarre route to leading Malawi at Afcon,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/08/mario-marinica-malawi-afcon-bizarre-route-manager-romania-briton
1/8/2022,"Rarely has a film been as divisive as Adam McKay’s climate satire Don’t Look Up. Although it has been watched by millions, and is already Netflix’s third most watched film ever, the response from critics was largely negative. Many found its story of scientists who discover an asteroid heading for Earth a clumsy allegory for the climate crisis, while others just found it boring. But many in the climate movement have praised the film, and audience reviews have been generally positive. We asked four climate experts to give their views on the film. Warning: spoilers ahead.  The starkest thing about Don’t Look Up is the sheer depth of the emotional significance it has for the folks who’ve been in the trenches of the climate fight for a long time. They’ve encountered decades of madness, as their warnings were twisted, ignored, denied and downplayed by politicians, media and devious industry players. Those people feel intense catharsis when they watch this film. It is not a great film, but to release that painful pressure valve, it doesn’t need to be. Regardless, we have to engage with the deeper flaws of this film. It’s a massive hit, widely viewed across the world. It matters then that in attempting to hold a mirror up to humanity’s response to the climate crisis, it has strange priorities. Weirdly absent from the film is a clear analogue of the fossil fuel industry (Rylance’s techy disaster capitalist wants to exploit the mineral wealth of the comet, but he isn’t piloting the asteroid for profit). Considering the film is touted as holding up a “devastating mirror”, the absence of the main character of the climate crisis is unforgivable. Similarly, the toxicity of the fossil industry’s impact across both sides of politics would have been a richer, funnier and more accurately reflective approach. The Trump satire falls flat. The void left by the fossil industry is filled with strange choices. Media misreporting is mostly put down to air-headed morning show fluff, but in reality, journalism’s most deadly failures on climate come down to false balance (which features only briefly), or energised disinformation (there’s no News Corp analogue here, extra weird considering McKay’s EP role on the very funny, Murdoch-inspired Succession). The film wastes hours hand-wringing about celebrity culture, algorithms, memes and data privacy. But the real villains of the climate crisis aren’t citizens distracted by Ariana Grande and Twitter. They’re the decision-makers in the fossil fuel industry, their lobbyists, their marketing firms and their broadly spread political defence squad. I hope the next time this opportunity comes up, Hollywood aims for the people piloting the asteroid, and I hope they put effort into ensuring they hit those targets. Writing about the end of the world is often a thankless task, so the prospect of Don’t Look Up immediately appealed. Billed as a satirical comedy, what satire could even come close to the experience of the world’s biggest climate conference, Cop26 in Glasgow, where the main achievement of nearly 200 governments and 30,000 delegates after two weeks of wrenching talks and stark scientific warnings was a resolve to return next year and try a bit harder? After 17 years of reporting on the climate crisis, I doubted at first that the film had much to tell me about the frustrations of communicating a hypothetical catastrophe. As the film’s scientists first struggled to clothe their data in sober, measured terms, then broke into swearing, arm-waving shrieks about provable imminent apocalypse, I nodded along. Yes, that’s what it feels like, and no, no one listens, not until it is too late. Yet it was illuminating in unexpected ways – something I’ve always struggled with is how rational people can fail to grasp the scale of climate breakdown, how we could leave it so late. As the film shows, it’s partly because vested interests keep it that way, but it’s also just because we’re human. Believing in disaster before it strikes is fundamentally not how we work. The role of the techno-loon, played by Mark Rylance, struck another chord. Cop26 was not a failure, though on the surface that was the obvious conclusion – it was more nuanced than that. Soon after the Cop26 circus left Glasgow, the danger of painting the outcome in such black-and-white terms became apparent, as well-meaning experts concluded – in all seriousness – as talking didn’t work, our best hope would be for billionaires to bypass the UN and geoengineer the climate from space. Because obviously the answer to a vast uncontrolled experiment on the atmosphere is to conduct a vast uncontrolled experiment on the atmosphere. Don’t Look Up is hardly subtle, which may be why climate scientists have enjoyed it more than some film critics. But in a world where the president of the most powerful democracy appeared close to inciting insurrection, where businesses argue over whether saving the planet makes economic sense, where oil apologists ally with Covid deniers, where a teenager shows more maturity than 200 heads of government – well, subtlety sailed off across the horizon a long time ago. There was a lot I liked about Don’t Look Up – it’s a broadly smart satire with some zinger one-liners and in my view the film pretty successfully used the impending doom of a scientifically indisputable planet-killing comet to draw parallels to the impending doom of the climate emergency, which we’re watching play out in real time. In the film, the world has six months and 14 days to save the planet from destruction but fails to do so because short-term political gain, corporate greed, misinformation, and utter stupidity divides America. In real life the clock is also ticking but the inaction and political failures go back decades. How Kate Dibiasky, the postgraduate student played by Jennifer Lawrence who discovered the comet, is portrayed as an unhinged hysterical woman, will resonate with many female climate scientists and activists whose crucial knowledge has been sidelined. The scene where her parents declare that they’re in favour of the jobs the comet will provide will resonate with millions of people, including me, trying to deal with relatives who have bought into political lies. I appreciated the young Indian guy who pointed out that the US didn’t invite any other countries to participate in its space mission to save the planet singlehandedly, which also helped make sense of the casual and not so casual racism by American leaders scattered throughout. But I didn’t get the fleeting shots of Black and Brown people watching the disaster unfold passively, and the scene where an Indigenous man plays a sacred drum (used in many Indigenous cultures to connect with the spiritual world) as the forest burns around him felt uncomfortable. But my main beef is the “we’re all in this together” message, as if the climate crisis will impact everyone equally like a killer comet. It won’t, and those who’ve contributed least to global heating are already bearing the brunt of rising sea levels and deadly weather events such as fires, floods, extreme heat and droughts. Climate justice starts with recognising these inequities, otherwise the impending doom will arrive much sooner for some. I loved Don’t Look Up, both as an entertainment and as a climate crisis parable. But the movie has been panned by many critics, with the main charge being that it is heavy-handed, blunt and too obvious. But that is exactly the point. Scientists have been issuing blunt warnings about obvious dangers of global heating for years and have been ignored – carbon emissions are still rising. The film perfectly skewers the key ways in which they have been ignored: for short-term political expediency and short-term corporate profit. In particular, the movie beautifully portrays the incredulity of scientists that their carefully constructed evidence can be dismissed with bluster such as “we’ll sit tight and assess” by leaders more concerned about today’s political weather and a media more interested in the minutiae of celebrities’ lives. The film is a satire, but is it still too heavy-handed to reflect a deeper truth? Perhaps for critics assessing the movie solely on artistic merit, but not for scientific communicators such as Neil deGrasse Tyson, who told his 14 million Twitter followers: “Everything I know about news-cycles, talk shows, social media, and politics tells me the film was instead a documentary.” The public seems to be siding with the movie makers. In its first 11 days, Don’t Look Up became Netflix’s third most-viewed film ever, and 250,000 people on IMDb gave the film a strong average rating of 7.3, compared with a Metacritic review of just 50%. But global heating is a slow-motion disaster, not a comet set to destroy the Earth within months that needs to be nudged off course. The solutions to the climate crisis are much more complex and another criticism is that the film presents none of these. I’d argue it doesn’t need to – the solutions exist and are well known. The point of the film is savagely highlighting the absurdity of staring disaster in the face, then looking away rather than acting. In that respect, it is a triumph.",Arts/Film,Don’t Look Up: four climate experts on the polarising disaster film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/08/dont-look-up-four-climate-experts-on-the-polarising-disaster-film
1/8/2022,"Last year may not be a year on which many of us care to look back, but from a beauty point of view, it was unexpectedly fruitful. During lockdown I discovered what I can safely call my favourite cleansing balm of all time. I have now bought three large tubs of Farmacy’s Green Clean (£24), and I doubt I’ll ever be without it. It’s not thick and gloopy, but fine and elegant in formulation, liquefying instantly with fingertip warmth before removing every last scrap of makeup (including caked-on mascara, which swirls off muddily in seconds). A dash of warm water sends it milky; a swish of a flannel removes it completely without stripping any residual moisture. It’s perfect. Despite being mostly home-based and with more time on my hands, I have further streamlined my skincare routine in the past 12 months. Murad’s Vita-C Glycolic Brightening Serum (£72) does the work of an exfoliant and an antioxidant serum in one pump, applied straight after cleansing. This timesaving innovation is suitable for all skins and ages, adds instant plumpness, visible glow and lasting hydration, and is impeccably behaved beneath makeup. I eagerly await a bargain dupe I can share with you: rest assured, I shall report back when one inevitably lands.  It’s probably not fair to include a whole skincare brand in my picks but, truly, Versed seems incapable of making a dud. Fairly priced and as consistent as it is prolific, Versed makes great moisturisers, serums, masks and more. Last year, its winning streak continued with Weekend Glow Brightening Solution (£16.50), a liquid exfoliant for those who don’t want the 2-in-1 concept of the Murad serum. This tonic is swept over face and neck after cleansing, to keep both flake-free, bright and smooth. It’s comparable in performance to others at three times the price. Last year was also a vintage year for sunscreens, and three superstars spring immediately to mind. La Roche Posay SPF30 Hyalu B5 Aquagel (£34.50) is a dream for dehydrated types who find most sunscreens greasy. Garnier Ambre Solaire Over Makeup Super UV SPF50 (£6.50) is arguably the most useful, bargainous product of the decade, and solves the age-old problem of needing to top up your sun protection without removing your makeup.

1/8/2022,"Two strange things happen in a Northern Irish village in the summer holidays of 1993. First, Hannah’s classmates start dying. Then, one by one, they return to haunt her. There’s a pattern to the deaths. Strange lumps cluster on the victim’s skin, they become feverish, then their organs fail. Within hours of their passing – and even before the village’s well-oiled gossip machine has begun spreading the news – they come to Hannah. Each appears just once, flicking through magazines in the doctor’s surgery, or scrunched up in the darkness of the bathroom as Hannah gropes her way in for a wee. They are subtly changed: older, with a coat of nail polish here, a drop of extra confidence there. After a few words, they vanish. Two questions propel Carson’s compassionate and meticulously observed third novel. Why has this plague hit Ballylack? And why, of all her class, is Hannah the one blessed with apparent health, and cursed with strange visions?  Carson was born in Ballymena, the Antrim village whose famously pious council banned Electric Light Orchestra and Brokeback Mountain. Now living in Belfast, she has spoken of her desire to give a voice to the Protestant experience in the province. Her previous novel, The Fire Starters, which won the European Union prize for literature, set a magical siren among sectarian violence in a carefully drawn Belfast. The Raptures brings a similar mix of granular detail and uncanny happenings to Ballylack, a village whose name and religious conservatism carry more than an echo of her birthplace. Here, homes bear “wonky paintings of the Queen, Princess Di and King Billy”, local pastors boom at the pulpit and schoolboy drummers soundtrack Orange marches. One mum is banned from demonstrating yoga at the school fair; Hannah’s evangelical household don’t let her study dinosaurs or sing Beatles songs. The orthodoxy can be crushing, but Ballylack is no monolith. Some residents come from the Philippines or China, and not everyone is a church regular. There’s a “fairy tree” on the edge of town and a folk healer in the neighbouring village, while the era of alcopops, 2 Unlimited and bomber jackets is dawning for Hannah’s pre-teen class. Ballylack’s miniature pandemic tears holes in this community. Bereaved parents turn on each other, or reach out towards vigilante justice. Those with faith wonder if it is strong enough. News reporters swarm around the houses of ailing children. Seán, a crisis management officer brought in to investigate, scrabbles to find the outbreak’s cause, until one of Hannah’s ghostly visitors drops a clue. Shy but resolute Hannah is Carson’s main focus, but The Raptures slips through Ballylack like a sympathetic spirit, checking in on parents and children and spending time with fixer Seán, taciturn farmer Alan and his wife, Maganda. The narrative voice takes on the tics, rhythms and thoughts of the characters, occasionally stumbling but never falling. Instead it rolls out in a great, chatty cascade, drawing the reader into the community’s fraying confidence and driving the story onward. The result is an intriguingly mixed-up book. The Raptures is a study of village life that brings the easy familiarity of a sitcom to its cast, but it’s also an Agatha Christie-esque whodunnit, a dark supernatural mystery and an account of mass trauma. Carson forges these parts into a tragicomedy in which fantastic elements slot almost seamlessly alongside kitchen-sink realism. Given Hannah is the novel’s centrepiece, this makes a fair bit of sense: why wouldn’t a child who’s spent many Sundays “drinking in the Apocalypse like a wee sponge” view ghostly classmates as just another of life’s mysteries? Hannah takes a singular path through the grim plague and Ballylack’s religious groupthink, and Carson ends The Raptures on a note of measured optimism. The village may be battered and grieving, but there’s patience and kindness here too, and green shoots that stubbornly poke through the scorched earth.
