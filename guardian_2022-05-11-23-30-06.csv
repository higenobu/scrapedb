5/11/2022,"In my childhood, my family lived in a commune of 20 identical yellow houses on the outskirts of Copenhagen. There was dinner six days a week at the “common house”. The neighbours also shared maintenance duties, prepared after-school snacks, kept a shop without a shopkeeper, and celebrated most holidays together. We were the only non-Danes at the commune, and our arrival was at once exciting and disconcerting for the group. We were too loud, our house was too bright, we had family and friends visiting from Turkey for months on end. But we were also the most popular cooks at the commune, spending out of pocket, beyond the dinner budgets, to make roast lamb and feta pastries. The commune was an experiment in living together, as equals, though to me, it was also an education in all the ways that we were different. I’m fascinated by lives that unravel in close proximity. What draws me to contemplate life as a model for fiction is the crossover of intimacy and distance, the ways in which lives interact, get entangled, or pass each other by. Neighbours offer a unique vantage point in fiction, because they witness much of life on the surface but may be blind to the depths. The friendship of neighbours is also interesting to me: neighbours must maintain a delicate balance of courtesy for all the living together that lies ahead. In my novel White on White, the painter Agnes begins to tell pieces of her life story to the art history student renting the flat below her studio. At first, the student is fascinated by Agnes and eager for her friendship, but as Agnes becomes unhinged, the student chooses the anonymity of being a neighbour, choosing to avoid emotional responsibility. The following books investigate lives at close proximity, at once familiar and distant. 1. The Magic Mountain by Thomas Mann, translated by John E WoodsHans Castorp arrives at a sanatorium to visit his cousin and ends up staying for a very long time. This is a book about time, and about death, but it is told through the interactions with the sanatorium’s patients over dinners and lunches of small talk. Everyone is sick, and like well-mannered neighbours, everyone avoids the subject. But the residents’ shared fate creates an unspoken bond and a powerful backdrop for the novel. 2. A House in Norway by Vigdis Hjorth, translated by Charlotte BarslundAlma, a tapestry artist, rents out the annexe of her house to a Polish family, whose lives she witnesses from her own window over the course of six years. The novel’s premise puts the artist’s liberal views into uneasy practice. Alma has always taken pride on her progressive values, but discovers, as soon as the Polish family moves in, that she is not as tolerant as she thought. This is a brilliant book about immigration, what it means to live together, and the fragile ideals of the European project. 3. Scorpionfish by Natalie BakopoulosThis atmospheric novel epitomises the intimate distance of being a neighbour. Mira returns to Athens after her parents’ deaths and on her first night meets a sea captain who lives in the apartment across from hers. Both of them are grieving in different ways, and they form an unusual friendship, exchanging night-time stories across their balconies. Mira’s walks around the city, her dinners and drinks with friends and her afternoons of swimming are punctuated by the nightly return home, to the balcony, to confide in a near-stranger. 4. My Heart Hemmed In by Marie NDiaye, translated by Jordan StumpNadia and Ange are schoolteachers who have built respectable, middle-class lives for themselves. One day, a strange wound appears on Ange’s stomach. While the whole community slowly shuns the teachers, a neighbour, Nogent, whom they had always disdained, comes to help them in their vulnerable state and moves in to care for them. Marie NDiaye is a master of creating menacing, off-kilter worlds that speak to the truth of human experience. 5. Friends and Dark Shapes by Kavita BedfordThis book, about a group of housemates in Sydney, beautifully maps the spaces of loneliness and intimacy in the midst of gentrification, temporary work, personal grief and collective joy. One of the pleasures of Bedford’s novel is following the housemates on their daily routines, going to gallery openings for free drinks, hanging out aimlessly in the garden, discussing best ways of stocking up on toilet paper, and going to ocean pools. 6. Monkey Grip by Helen Garner“In the old brown house on the corner, a mile from the middle of the city, we ate bacon for breakfast every morning of our lives. There were never enough chairs for us all to sit up at the meal table.” So begins Monkey Grip, another novel about communal living, this time in 1970s Melbourne. Nora is a single mother and in love with the smack-addicted Javo. She changes houses and partners, in new reconfigurations exploring what it means to live together. The novel’s loose, diaristic style perfectly captures the fluidity of friendships, love, sex and cohabitation. 7. By the Sea by Abdulrazak GurnahOne afternoon, Saleh Omar arrives at Gatwick airport from Zanzibar, seeking asylum. He is taken to a B&B where other men, from Kosovo and the Czech Republic, are lodging. Though they share the same strange accommodation, they know little about the histories that have brought them here. The only person in England who knows Omar is the son of the man whose name Omar has taken, once a neighbour in Zanzibar. When the two meet, a story of the past is revealed, at once intimate and mysterious, the fates of the men entangled profoundly. 8. The Borrowers by Mary NortonHow could I not include this enchanting book, which I read and re-read in the years that my family lived in the Danish commune. It must, in part, be responsible for my fascination with neighbours and their secret lives. The borrowers are tiny people who live in the walls and under the floorboards of an English house and “borrow” from the big humans. Though the house’s tenants are unaware of their miniature neighbours, one boy starts a friendship with the young borrower, Arrietty Clock. 9. A Luminous Republic by Andrés Barba, translated by Lisa DillmanThirty-two children appear in the town of San Cristóbal bordering the jungle, speaking a strange language of their own. No one knows where they have come from nor where they disappear to each night. The novel taps into our fears of the other, the ways we draw rigid boundaries, and our desire to tame the wild. A profound work about sharing physical and psychological universes. 10. Free Love by Tessa HadleyHadley’s latest novel, set in 60s London, is about 44-year-old Phyllis who lives in the suburbs with her husband and children. One night, at the edge of a pond, she kisses a young family friend: her life is changed. Two sets of neighbours brilliantly portray Phyllis’s split existence. There are the Holmeses across the street, at whose party Phyllis feels suffocated. And there is Barbara, the nurse from Granada, who is the neighbour of Phyllis’s young lover in Ladbroke Grove. These neighbours embody not only the starkly different social worlds that Phyllis inhabits, but also what it means for a woman reeling out of her assigned roles to be looked at by society.

5/11/2022,"“You are all the same”. In the time I have been an MP the stench of sleaze has soaked into the reputation of us all, as scandal after scandal chips away at what little trust is left in public life. As parliament contends with yet more allegations of misogyny and bad behaviour, it’s time to send in the mums. The evidence shows that getting more women elected at all requires a high volume to stand in the first place. At the last general election, more than 3,300 people stood for election. Just 7% of those who were successful were women. Thanks to all-women shortlists (AWS), Labour can be proud compared to its opponents of its record – in 2019, 53% of our candidates were female. Yet even with AWS, the women standing are older than their male counterparts – or currently don’t have kids. We know when it comes to parents, fathers are not deterred from standing for public office, but mothers often are. The barriers to mums being MPs start even before anyone has set foot in Westminster. Political party selections are often long-winded and expensive, as candidates trek to marginal seats to campaign for months on end. Labour recently introduced a shorter process and spending cap to try to address these concerns. Even so, if you have costly caring commitments, it’s not hard to see why many brilliant candidates wait for their children to be older before standing or sit it out altogether. Those who have taken time out to care for family members are often labelled as “lacking campaign experience”. Many report members grilling them on who will look after their children if they are selected – or if they want kids at all – in contrast to their male counterparts. Whether you can see your family should be based not on the patronage of whips, but actual policies that ensure it’s possible to be both a good parliamentarian and a good parent at the same time for all. As a new mum, I fought, and have failed so far, to win the argument for parliament and Labour to provide maternity cover and family friendly working for MPs. If we want our democracy to reflect our demographics, we must stop expecting mums alone to overcome these obstacles or tell them they are “victims” for asking for change. As Labour begins selecting candidates for the next election without the backstop of AWS to ensure women are chosen at all, it’s time to act. Three months ago, we set up MotheRED. It’s a time limited project, learning from both the success of Emily’s list in the 1990s and Vote Mama in the US in getting mums into office. Funded through a mixture of private donations and a crowdfunder, we are giving grants of up to £2,000 to mums who want to stand as Labour candidates at the next election. The message we want to send is twofold. First, it is financial – money helps to pay for childcare to stop this being a barrier. Second, we want to spotlight the brilliant talent out there we are missing out on, making selecting a mum not a problem, but a positive choice constituencies make. It’s clear how much of a difference searching out mums brings to Labour’s talent pool for the next election. Of those who have applied to date, 35% are mums from Black and ethnic minority backgrounds. This compares to just over 10% of current MPs. Among the applicants, 8% are LGBT, 29% are single parents, 20% are disabled and 22% have children with special educational needs. And 15% of them are on incomes lower than the universal credit threshold. They’re nothing like the existing parliament. The difficult decisions about who gets funded rests with a group of 30 ambassadors from every corner of the Labour movement, including Zarah Sultana, Bell Ribeirio-Addy, Shami Chakrabarti, Emma Hardy, Sharon Waldron, Jan Royall, Jacqui Smith and Cherie Blair. From a prime minister who lies repeatedly to an MP watching porn in the parliamentary chamber, or the allegation that nearly 10% of MPs are being investigated by the independent complaints process, Westminster is struggling. Forty-one per cent of people in England think democracy isn’t working at all – in this space extremism flourishes, feeding on the perception that it is perpetually out of touch. All progressives should be asking how they can help make change happen. One answer is to put your money where your mouth is. The more funds we raise through MotheRED, the more mothers we can send to sort out the mother of all parliaments.

5/11/2022,"This hipster hypefest is an adventure in alternative existences and multiverse realities from writer-directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert – the “Daniels” – who in 2016 gave us the Jonzeian comedy Swiss Army Man. Everything Everywhere All at Once has been critically swooned over in the US and pretty much everywhere else, so it’s disconcerting to find it frantically hyperactive and self-admiring and yet strangely laborious, dull and overdetermined, never letting up for a single second to let us care about, or indeed believe in, any of its characters. Michelle Yeoh plays Evelyn, a Chinese-American woman who co-owns a scuzzy laundromat with her husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan); Evelyn is discontented with her life and has a tense relationship with her daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu), using Joy’s frail and old-fashioned grandfather Gong Gong (James Hong) – who lives with them – as an excuse not to accept Joy’s gay identity. Evelyn reaches a crisis when confronted by an angry tax officer, Deirdre Beaubeirdra (Jamie Lee Curtis), who is auditing their business, and furious about Evelyn’s attempts to claim deductions for a karaoke machine for the laundromat’s community party nights, at which Evelyn also offers food. In her heart, poor Evelyn figures she could have been a singer, or a chef, or a movie star in another life and this tax-deduction issue triggers a crazy journey into any number of different universes for more than two hours. There are some nice gags and sprightly Kubrickian touches, and one genuinely shocking scene when Evelyn fat-shames her daughter – an authentically upsetting moment of family dysfunction that seems to come from another film, one in a parallel universe. But this mad succession of consequence-free events, trains of activity which get cancelled by a switch to another parallel world, means that nothing is actually at stake, and the film becomes a formless splurge of Nothing Nowhere Over a Long Period of Time. Again, this film is much admired and arrives adorned with saucer-eyed critical notices … I wish I liked it more.  Everything Everywhere All at Once is released in cinemas on 13 May.",Arts/Film,Everything Everywhere All at Once review – nothing nowhere over a long period of time,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/11/everything-everywhere-all-at-once-review-nothing-nowhere-over-a-long-period-of-time
5/11/2022,"Lolly Adefope, 31, started her career in standup comedy. She has appeared in series including Miracle Workers, Shrill, This Time With Alan Partridge and Ghosts, and is currently working on her first podcast, Fanmail, with Steve Coogan’s production company, Baby Cow. What was the best thing you did on screen last year?The best – or maybe the worst – thing I did was in the final season of the Hulu series Shrill. Me and ER Fightmaster, who plays Em, had a scene where our characters made a sex tape, and we just took the piss out of it. It was very fun, but some of the noises I made were kind of unacceptable. Which role were you most jealous of in 2021?I wish I’d been in The White Lotus. It had masterful acting, writing, directing – everything about it was perfect and it was a character comedy, which is what I do. It almost seemed like theatre, and the tension building up to the finale was very addictive. I didn’t see the ending coming at all. Who would play you in the TV show of your life?Wunmi Mosaku, because people always get us confused. It’s one of those things where you can’t even say, “We’re just two Black women, we don’t look alike,” because we actually really do. I think we should play sisters. What makes you happy?Good wine. Good friends. Good food … Good sense of humour [laughs]. Your TV guilty pleasureThe Real Housewives. I’ve almost finished New York and I’ve moved on to New Jersey. And soon I’ll be moving on to another one. I could watch it all day, every day. It’ll change your life. When was the last time the TV made you cry?The moment in Vigil where Suranne Jones says to the villain: “I’m arresting you for murder,” but Paterson Joseph’s character doesn’t know that the person has been murdered, and you see him realising what’s happened. I burst into tears and I cried for 10 minutes. My boyfriend was like: “Stop!” If your life were a TV show, what would the title be?Lollywood, or maybe Lollypalooza. What makes you reach for the remote (to turn the TV off)?Post-match football commentary. I don’t mind it at half-time, but once it’s done, it’s done. Who is the most famous person in your phone contacts?Probably Daniel Radcliffe and Steve Buscemi from Miracle Workers. I don’t know which of them is more famous. Are you Succession’s Team Shiv or Team Tom?I’m 100% Team Tom, but really Kendall is my favourite – Jeremy Strong is the best actor in the world. Tom is probably the best thing about the show, though. He’s just unreal.  Ghosts is available on BBC iPlayer.

5/11/2022,"Russian and Ukrainian forces appear to be settling into a gruelling and deadly stalemate in Ukraine’s east, with warnings from a senior US military official that neither side can win in the present circumstances. Lt Gen Scott Berrier, the director of the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency, who gave evidence on Tuesday to the Senate armed forces committee, said: “The Russians aren’t winning and the Ukrainians aren’t winning, and we’re at a bit of a stalemate here.” The Russian military has claimed its forces have advanced as far as the border between the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, potentially edging towards securing control of the Donbas region. Russia and Ukraine have made inflated claims regarding their successes, with assessments emerging from western defence and intelligence officials in recent weeks often painting a more subdued picture. Heavy fighting is still raging at the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, as Russian forces attempt to complete the capture of the strategically vital port. Hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers are holed up in the steel mill’s underground bunkers, many of them wounded. It was thought that all remaining civilians were evacuated on Saturday, but on Tuesday an aide to the mayor said at least 100 were still to leave. Under Russian control Russian invasion route Russian airstrike or shelling Russian attack or movement Ukrainian attack or movement  The world becomes increasingly concerned about more than 100,000 Russian troops that have accumulated on the Ukrainian border. Western intelligence agencies sound the alarm, though Vladimir Putin insists Russia has no plans to invade. On 22 February, Putin declared that Russia would recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states, after Russia-backed separatists partially seized the regions. Ukraine and the west's worst fears are realised as airstrikes hit targets across the country, as far west as Lviv. By clicking on the dots on the map, you'll reveal more information about individual strikes and events. Russian forces invade Ukraine from multiple entry points: Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south. Russian forces move on several points on the first day of the invasion. Several key locations, including the Chernobyl exclusion zone, are captured by the Russian army. Russian troops enter parts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they face strong resistance. After fierce fighting prevents them from seizing the Hostomel airbase on the first day of the invasion, progress is limited to the north-west of the capital. They are still, however, able to claim some land on the outskirts of the city. Elsewhere, fighting continues even as Russian progress slows. Russian forces move to encircle the southern city of Mariupol, although they enjoy less success in the north, where they abandon an attempt to take Chernihiv after heavy fighting. Russian forces advance on key cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, Kyiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. A large convoy of military vehicles approaches the capital, although progress is limited and logistical problems are reported. As the war enters its second week, Russia steps up shelling of civilian areas. Operations to envelop Kyiv remain the focus of Russia’s efforts, but the ISW reports three other aims: seizing Kharkiv, taking Mariupol and securing a “land bridge” in the south, and securing Kherson in order to set conditions for a drive west towards Mykolaiv and Odesa. Little progress is made over the first two weeks of March. Amid reports of lost momentum and low morale, Russian forces are consolidating positions with reinforcements and probing defences around Kyiv. Dozens of civilians are reportedly killed as Russian forces hit cities with artillery and airstrikes, seen as a new tactic in the face of limited advances on the ground. Russia is widely seen as making its best advances in the south, where Kherson becomes the first major city to fall under Russian control. On the other southern front, several buildings in Mariupol are flattened and people are left without water or power. Russia breaks ceasefires put in place to allow for evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha. As the conflict concludes its third week, Russia sends in reinforcements to tighten its grip around the key cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, which remain under Ukrainian control. Russian advances in the south contrast with difficulties its forces have faced in the north and north-east. Nowhere is this resistance stronger than in the increasingly fortified capital, Kyiv. Russia steps up its artillery and airstrikes on the city in an apparent attempt to degrade defending forces' capacity and morale. It is a strategy that has so far failed in other cities such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. In the months before its invasion Russia deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long considered the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and Belarus before the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had 169,000-190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land, and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine would never join Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
5/11/2022,"The traditional French madeleine – made famous by the writer Marcel Proust as a metaphor for childhood memories – is at the centre of a murder trial this week after a man was accused of using one of the miniature sponge cakes to kill an elderly widow. The 92-year-old woman, Yvette B, was found dead in her bed in the Alzheimer’s unit of a care home in Tours in May 2019 with madeleine crumbs in her mouth. Less than an hour before she was found by a nurse she had a visitor, an acquaintance named as Alain J, who had brought a packet of supermarket madeleines for her. Staff said they found it suspicious that he locked the door to Yvette’s room. The case has been nicknamed “the madeleine trial”. The court will consider whether a cake was used to suffocate the woman. Yvette B, who had been a resident of the care home for five years, was described as a warm, kind person by a family member. She needed help to eat, with her food usually cut into small pieces. The court will hear allegations of a possible financial motive. Alain J had acquired a house belonging to the woman, and paid a life annuity sum to her each month, a contract that meant he could not sell the property until she died. Alain J, 63, a former firefighter, has denied the accusations. He told the court: “I hope my innocence will be recognised.” In a letter written from prison to the local newspaper, La Nouvelle République, while he was awaiting trial, he said: “I don’t fear going to trial but I fear dying before I can prove my innocence.” His lawyer, Abed Bendjador, said his client was living a “nightmare”. When the case was ordered to trial, Bendjador said investigators had not managed to prove the man’s guilt or defined the “conditions or the modus operandi by which he could have suffocated this lady with a madeleine”.",News/World news,French man accused of suffocating woman with madeleine cake,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/french-man-accused-of-suffocating-woman-with-madeleine-cake
5/11/2022,"Three Russian prisoners of war accused of targeting or murdering civilians, and a soldier who allegedly killed a man before raping his wife, are set to be in the dock in the first war crimes trials of the Ukraine conflict, the Ukrainian prosecutor general has revealed. More than 10,700 crimes have been registered since the war began by the office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general, led by Iryna Venediktova, and a handful of cases have now been filed or are ready to be submitted in what marks a watershed moment two months into the war. Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old commander of the Kantemirovskaya Tank Division, who is currently in Ukrainian custody, is expected to be the first to face trial over his alleged murder of a 68-year-old man. It is alleged Shysimarin, a sergeant, had been fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine when he killed a civilian on 18 February in the village of Chupakhivka. He is accused of driving a stolen car with four other soldiers as he sought to flee Ukrainian fighters and then shooting dead the unarmed man on a bicycle as he was talking on his phone. He was ordered “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. The crime is said to have happened close to the victim’s house and was committed using an AK-74. The case has this week been filed at a criminal court. “He is here [in Ukraine], we have him,” said Venediktova, speaking from her heavily fortified headquarters in Kyiv. A spokesperson added: “Prosecutors and investigators of the SBU [Ukrainian secret services] have collected enough evidence of his involvement in violation of the laws and customs of war combined with premeditated murder. For these actions, he faces 10 to 15 years in prison or life in prison.” Separately, on 24 February, the day Vladimir Putin’s “special military operation”was launched, it is alleged two Russian soldiers using a Soviet truck-mounted 122mm multiple rocket launcher carried out artillery shelling of homes and civilian buildings in the village of Kozacha Lopan in Kharkiv district. They also allegedly hit an “educational institution” in the city of Dergachiv, from Belgorod in Russia. The soldiers later crossed over the border of Ukraine and continued shelling targets in the Kharkiv region, it is claimed, but they were taken prisoner by Ukrainian forces and now await trial. Their case file, laying out charges of breaking the laws and customs of war, has also been filed at a criminal procedural court in Ukraine, but names and photographs are yet to be issued. In a final case that is probably heading to a trial in absentia, a soldier named as Mikhail Romanov, who has a large tattoo of a bear on his chest, is accused of breaking into a house in March in a village in the Brovarsky region, murdering a man and then repeatedly raping his wife while “threatening her and her underage child with violence and weapons”. A second soldier also raped the 33-year-old woman, who has a four-year-old son. The case is yet to be filed at court but the prosecutor’s office was able to provide a photograph from social media that has been used by the victim to identify the man who allegedly attacked her. Romanov’s apparent partner was contacted for comment by this newspaper but she did not respond to questions. Of Romanov, Venediktova said: “Now we don’t know where he is – maybe he is fighting still, maybe he is on rotation in the Russian federation, maybe he is dead. We don’t know but we want to prosecute him in absentia.” She added: “We want to demonstrate to these criminals that we will find them. And we will prevent the deaths of other people in other territories.” Venediktova, who on Monday travelled to Poland to meet the UK attorney general, Suella Braverman, who has provided her with a former international criminal court judge as an adviser, said 36 identified war crimes suspects were currently being prosecuted, with various levels of progress. Venediktova, whose office desk has a dozen hotlines, including one to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said she feared many more crimes would emerge from the territories in the east and south of Ukraine currently occupied by Russia, including the devastated port city of Mariupol. Venediktova, who keeps a Russian cluster bomb casing that was found in Kherson, a city in south Ukraine, on her desk, said countless atrocities were being committed. She said: “I have a theory that the Russian federation decided that when they come to Ukraine everyone will be happy to see them but when they understood that the whole population was fighting against them, against a common enemy, they decided to do everything to scare the population.” At the end of March videos emerged of alleged war crimes committed by Ukrainian soldiers against Russian prisoners of war, including a film that appeared to show three soldiers being shot in the legs. Venediktova said her office was continuing to investigate those claims and others. She said: “We shall not act as barbarians but as people who understand the rule of law. We are still investigating but as I understand some of the facts could be fake. [But] there is not only one case where we started investigations, we have several.”",News/World news,Ukraine prosecutors ready to launch first war crimes trials of Russia conflict,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/ukraine-prosecutors-ready-launch-first-war-crimes-russia-conflict
5/11/2022,"Filled with lustful murderers, dishevelled streetwalkers and hollow-eyed wartime amputees, George Grosz’s jagged sketches of Berlin street life during the Weimar Republic never sought to capture the German metropolis at its most beautiful. Only fitting, then, that Berlin’s first museum dedicated solely to its master chronicler should not be in the gilded neoclassical halls of the German capital’s Museum Island but a seedier part of the city in which the satirist and Dada artist was born and died. The Little Grosz Museum opens on Friday inside a former petrol station on the dusty Bülowstraße thoroughfare, overlooked by a noisy elevated metro track, and a stone’s throw from the German capital’s red-light strip around Nollendorfplatz. It began as a privately funded initiative started seven years ago by Ralph Jentsch, the managing director of Grosz’s estate. It does not have its own collection but will present works loaned from other galleries over two compact gallery floors. “George Grosz is an artist of worldwide renown, yet there is no museum on this globe that permanently shows more than two of his paintings,” Jentsch told the Guardian. This is in part because his work was spread far and wide in the tumult of 1920s and 30s Germany, and in some cases destroyed. Subject to several court cases during the Weimar years – over defamation of the German army, blasphemy and “attacks on public morals” – about 300 of Grosz’s works were seized, then sold or burned as degenerate art by the Nazis after he emigrated to the US in 1933. “Plans for a Grosz museum were long hampered by that dispersal,” said Jentsch. The small museum, which cannot hold more than 60 people at a time, serves up a reminder of the relevance of an uncompromising artist politicised by the horrors of war – while also correcting some of the myths about its hero along the way. In spite of his pacifist inclinations, Grosz volunteered to join the army in November 1914, in the hope of preempting conscription and avoiding being sent to the front. One commonly told story, fed in part by the artist’s own vague descriptions of his wartime activity, is that the violence he witnessed in the first world war fired up the violent imagination of his later works and alienated him so radically from Germany that he decided to anglicise his name from Gross to Grosz to make a political statement. The curators of “Please write Grosz instead of Gross”, the museum’s first exhibition, say that tells only half the story. After tracking down Grosz’s military medical records, they say it is likely the dadaist never experienced any frontline action first-hand. While his regiment fought trench warfare in Flanders in February 1915, Grosz was recovering at Berlin’s Charité hospital, having fallen ill with sinusitis on the way to the front. How closely to the front the artist was when he collected impressions that would result in a series of four sketches with titles such as Battlefield, is unclear. When being redrafted into the reserve army two years later, Grosz had a mental breakdown, with officers finding him naked from the waist down on his first night. After the then 23-year-old tried to attack a medical officer with a knife, he was sent to a specialist hospital for patients with nervous system disorders where he spent the rest of the war. “Grosz saw the flipside of wartime heroism, but mainly from within hospitals, in the company of those spat out by the front,” said Pay Karstens, the exhibition’s curator. Digging through Grosz’s archive of early works, Karstens discovered that the artist’s change of surname took place years before the war, making a purely political motive unlikely. Born Georg Ehrenfried Gross, he signed his first work “Grosz” in 1906, aged 13, when an anti-nationalist sentiment was unlikely to have been held as a principled belief. “Grosz wanted to become a successful illustrator for satirical magazines at the time, and he needed a brand name,” said Karstens. “Gross was too much of an everyday name for that.” The anglicisation of his first name, by contrast, was a deliberately provocative act, at a time when other artists and poets celebrated their hatred of the wartime enemy, England. “After witnessing this year of war, I am no longer such a strong friend of my fatherland,” he wrote to a friend in June 1916. Pictures such as 1917’s German Men, piled with grotesquely fat men in uniforms, show an artist thoroughly disgusted with his country of birth. From 1917, the letters he sent from his hospital bed were signed “George Grosz”. Unlike his Dada jester-in-arms Helmut Herzfelde, who anglicised his name to John Heartfield around the same time, Grosz never sought to change his name officially by deed poll after the end of the war. Instead he voted with his feet and left for New York, and later Huntington, shortly before the Nazi party emerged as the biggest political force in the 1932 elections. One of the planned exhibitions at the Little Grosz Museum will focus on the works he produced in the US, a country in which he felt enough at home to opt for naturalisation, but where his new work was often ignored in favour of his sketches of Weimar Berlin. Other shows will focus on Grosz’s pioneering photo collages and his 1922 trip to the Soviet Union, which included an audience with Lenin. With a total of 10 six-month temporary exhibitions planned, the museum’s lifespan is likely to be limited to five years. “If Berlin still wants to have a Grosz museum after that, it needs to cough up,” said Juerg Judin, the Swiss art collector who turned the converted Shell petrol station into his home 10 years ago and has temporarily offered it to the curators.",News/World news,George Grosz: museum dedicated to city’s master chronicler opens in Berlin,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/george-grosz-museum-dedicated-master-chronicler-opens-berlin
5/11/2022,"It’s probably time that we face facts and declare James Cromwell to be our greatest living actor. When James Cromwell turns up in something, ropey Jurassic Park sequels notwithstanding, the audience automatically knows to breathe a sigh of relief. The moment he first appeared on Succession, for instance, was the moment that viewers could relax in the knowledge that the show would contain more than just surface-level nastiness. And while he was handed perhaps the silliest arc of anyone who appeared on 24 – he played Jack Bauer’s dad, and ended up getting blown to smithereens on an oil platform – we at least knew that the role was in the safest possible hands. But that isn’t the reason why James Cromwell is our greatest living actor. No, that’s because the man can walk it like he talks it. When other actors try to effect genuine change, they’ll do it in the most toe-curling ways. They will hop in a private jet in order to attend a climate crisis summit. They will make boneheaded, insincere awards ceremony speeches. They will, in the worst possible scenario, attempt to sing their way to raised awareness. Not James Cromwell, though. Cromwell is a man who, upon learning that Starbucks charges slightly more for oat milk than cow milk, will walk into a local branch and literally glue himself to the counter in protest. That is what happened this week. Cromwell, accompanied by some Peta activists, strolled into a New York Starbucks branch, calmly glued his hand to a counter and proceeded to read out a statement about the unfairness of the chain’s vegan policies, noting that he was following up on an unacknowledged petition that had been signed by 13,000 people. When he finished, the police showed up. Just as calmly, Cromwell unstuck his hand with a knife, then walked off. And while you could argue that Cromwell had picked the wrong target for his protest – maybe gluing himself to the Starbucks head office would have been a little more fair on the baristas, many of whom are young and badly paid and just trying to get through their shift without much hassle – you can’t help but commend the man’s guts. This is by no means his first rodeo, either. He protested against the Vietnam war in the 1960s, and defended the Black Panthers. A vegetarian since the mid-70s, he turned vegan after playing a farmer in the film Babe. In 2013 he was arrested for protesting over alleged animal mistreatment at the University of Wisconsin. In 2015 he was arrested for protesting against the construction of a natural gas power station in Wawayanda, New York. The following year he was arrested again, for protesting about underground gas storage near Seneca Lake. In 2017 he was arrested for protesting about SeaWorld’s treatment of its orcas. Then in 2019, he was arrested for protesting about the mistreatment of dogs at Texas A&M University. And now this. With everything else going on in the world, it would be easy to write off a coffee chain charging from 50 cents to a dollar for plant milk as a minor inconvenience. But this is the level at which Cromwell operates. He would rather fuse his skin to the interior of a building than let it slip. And it was worth it, too. This news story has gone international, and has caused such an unnecessary PR headache for Starbucks that you can expect the surcharge to be quietly dropped in the coming weeks. And perhaps he will change even more than that. Perhaps, when other celebrities see how efficiently James Cromwell managed to effect change – and, more importantly, how much press it got him – we will start to see them getting involved in more incidents of direct action. Today, James Cromwell glues himself to a Starbucks. Tomorrow, who knows, we might get to see Leonardo DiCaprio staple his bum to an abattoir.",Arts/Film,Soy Cromwell!

5/11/2022,"Democrat Joe Biden is “the best person” to lead the US, the Republican senator and fervent Donald Trump supporter Lindsey Graham said in tapes released on Monday by the authors of a bestselling political book. The South Carolina senator was speaking on and shortly after 6 January 2021 to Jonathan Martin and Alex Burns, now authors of This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden and the Battle for America’s Future. On 6 January 2021, shortly before the US Capitol was attacked, Trump told supporters to “fight like hell” in service of his lie that his defeat by Biden in the 2020 election was caused by voter fraud. A bipartisan Senate committee has linked seven deaths to the riot that followed, an unsuccessful attempt to stop certification of electoral college results. “Moments like this reset,” Graham said that day, in a tape played on CNN on Tuesday. “People will calm down. People will say, ‘I don’t want to be associated with that.’ This is a group within a group. What this does, there will be a rallying effect for a while, [then] the country says ‘We’re better than this.’” Asked if Biden could help the country come together again, Graham said: “Totally.” “He’ll maybe be the best person to have. I mean, how mad can you get at Joe Biden?” In the year and a half since the Capitol riot, much of the country, and most Republicans, have stayed mad at Biden. The president’s approval numbers continue to plumb depths similar to those charted by Trump while he was in office. Biden is reportedly mad at Graham, a longtime associate in the Senate who despite saying he was “out” of Trump’s camp immediately after the January 6 riot, soon returned to the fold. In other taped remarks played by Martin and Burns, Graham said Trump “misjudged the passion” of his supporters. “He plays the TV game and he went too far here,” the senator was heard to say. “That rally didn’t help, talking about primarying” the Wyoming representative Liz Cheney, a member of the House January 6 committee. “He created a sense of revenge.” Trump remains the dominant force in the Republican party, endorsing candidates in primaries and seemingly readying another run for the presidency in 2024. A spokesperson for Graham told CNN: “The Joe Biden we see as president is not the one we saw in the Senate. He’s pursued a far-left agenda as president.”",News/US news,"Lindsey Graham said Joe Biden is ‘best person’ to lead US, tapes reveal",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/11/lindsey-graham-joe-biden-donald-trump
