5/3/2022,"A British woman who is hosting her brother and his Ukrainian family under the government’s family scheme says the arrangement has left her struggling to make ends meet because of inbuilt discrimination in the rules. It is one of many problems identified in both of the government’s Ukraine hosting schemes – the family scheme and the sponsorship scheme. The woman, Julie Crowther, and her brother, Mark Burgess, are British citizens. Burgess is married to Victoriia, who is Ukrainian, and the couple have two daughters, Emma and Lily, aged seven and three. The family fled their home in Kyiv after the war started. Crowther offered to accommodate them in their three-bedroom home in Stockport. She has a range of health problems including fibromyalgia and a damaged nerve at the base of her spine and is unable to work. Her husband is a bus driver and does not earn a large wage. Crowther says household bills have more than doubled since the family arrived but that unlike hosts on the homes for Ukraine scheme who can access £350 per month, family scheme hosts cannot access support payments from government. “We are a low-income family and our bills have gone through the roof,” said Crowther. “My husband is doing more overtime just to put food on the table. He has to have an operation soon and won’t be able to work for a while. I don’t know what will happen to us then. The family scheme is discriminatory because we cannot get payments from government to cover the costs of hosting family members.” Crowther is in touch with lawyers and is exploring the possibility of a legal challenge about the discrimination she says those hosting under the Ukraine family scheme are experiencing. Other problems on the two government hosting schemes relate to a lack of oversight and checks conducted before Ukrainian refugees move in with hosts. One female host in her 60s discovered that the newly arrived 21-year-old woman she was hosting was involved in sex work and was being exploited and controlled by a pimp in Ukraine. Police were alerted and the young woman moved out. In another case a young Ukrainian woman who moved in with a female host was found to have serious mental health problems, which were not identified before the placement started. NHS mental health services became involved and clinicians said the young woman was not suitable for the scheme because of her health problems. The host said the experience had been very distressing and that checks should have been carried out before her guest moved in. “It hasn’t put me off helping Ukrainian refugees but more oversight of hosting is needed,” she said. The Guardian previously revealed the case of a Ukrainian woman who was left homeless just days after a host in Brighton demanded money from her to pay utility bills. Tim Naor Hilton, the chief executive of Refugee Action, said: “Ministers must act urgently to regulate matching and make sure councils are properly funded to carry out checks on properties where refugees are staying.” A spokesperson for the UN’s refugee agency said: “Some local authorities already report being overwhelmed in terms of being able to carry out checks on a timely basis, in offering financial support to hosts, and in finding emergency accommodation for those whose relationship breaks down or are in unsuitable accommodation. “Close support and prompt communication between the relevant ministries, councils and vetting processes are essential to ensure that accommodation is suitable prior to the arrival of refugees.” A government spokesperson said: “Taken together, our generous homes for Ukraine and Ukraine family schemes are one of the fastest and biggest visa programmes in UK history. The government is easing the financial burden on households who are hosting their Ukrainians relatives, giving people in the UK on either of our Ukraine schemes full access to work, study and benefits, including universal credit payments, from day one.”",News/World news,Woman hosting brother’s Ukrainian family left struggling to pay bills,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/woman-hosting-brothers-ukrainian-family-left-struggling-to-pay-bills
5/3/2022,"Top Gun: Maverick has been beset by so many delays that, by this point, any fool can anticipate the whole movie beat for beat. There’ll be tons and tons of cutting edge aerial photography, complete with shots of actors getting their faces squished into mush by G-force. There’ll be plenty of knowingly nostalgic nods to the original, too, with old characters making long overdue returns. But now for something few saw coming: the film will also include a Lady Gaga power ballad. Lady Gaga just shared a new song called Hold My Hand. It is definitely from Top Gun: Maverick because, in the official video, not only are the words “Lady Gaga” written in the official Top Gun font, but there’s also a black and white photograph of Gaga being brought to the point of orgasm by the flank of an aeroplane. The song itself is pretty good. It’s bombastic and emotional, and includes everything you could possibly want from a Lady Gaga power ballad, in that it sounds like Lady Gaga is shouting it at someone who just toppled over the railings of a cruise ship. “When I wrote this song for Top Gun: Maverick, I didn’t even realise the multiple layers it spanned across the film’s heart, my own psyche, and the nature of the world we’ve been living in,” Gaga wrote on Twitter. Which is fine. But what we don’t know about Hold My Hand is how it will feature in the movie. And, without exaggeration, this could be integral to the movie’s success. The easy thing to do would be to just chuck it on at the end. So Tom Cruise completes his mission, salutes his superiors who now look upon him with newfound gratitude, pauses by a fighter jet to stroke it as one would a horse, clambers in, takes off and, as the jet speeds off to destinations unknown, the credits roll and Hold My Hand comes on. However, this would be a profoundly un-Top Gunny thing to do. Because although Top Gun became a phenomenon in 1986 for a variety of reasons – including Tom Cruise’s innate star power and all the zippy shots of fighter jets in action – the main reason was its soundtrack. The Top Gun soundtrack, at the time, was perfect. It was a flawless mix of overdriven 1980s pop, composed and performed by figures who would come to embody the decade as a whole, and nostalgic oldies for anyone who might find all the synthy vamping a bit too much. So you have Kenny Loggins performing Giorgio Moroder and Tom Whitlock’s Danger Zone. You have Berlin belting out Take My Breath Away. You have Harold Faltermeyer’s deathless Top Gun Anthem. But you also have (Sittin’ On) The Dock of the Bay and You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feelin’. The soundtrack was such a sensation that it went nine times platinum in the US alone and Take My Breath Away won an Oscar. Key to this was the way that each song was baked into crucial scenes. The entire cast sang You’ve Lost That Lovin’ Feelin’ at Kelly McGillis. Take My Breath Away is the sex scene. Then there’s Playing with the Boys, which effectively gets its own instantly iconic music video spliced inside the film. It is impossible to separate Top Gun from its soundtrack. It seems unlikely that the same will be said for the sequel. Trailers for Top Gun: Maverick have so far been soundtracked by Top Gun Anthem, and apparently Danger Zone will also make an appearance. Other than that, it seems as if there will be a straight score composed by Faltermeyer and Hans Zimmer. It’s bound to be good and evocative and everything, but unless a huge amount of current bangers have been hiding in plain sight, it won’t be the same. That is unless Lady Gaga’s song is used to the best of its ability. If it is woven into the fabric of the film itself, ideally in a scene where Tom Cruise is begging a young recruit to hold his hand to save him from mortal danger, then all might just be saved.",Arts/Film,Will Lady Gaga help Top Gun: Maverick take everyone’s breath away?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/03/lady-gaga-top-gun-maverick-soundtrack-hold-my-hand
5/3/2022,"It was the busy Monday night that everyone could have done without – a creaking Eintracht Frankfurt, Borussia Mönchengladbach’s fans and, ultimately, RB Leipzig. While one Europa League semi-finalist, not quite fresh from a famous win over West Ham in London, struggled to a defeat in Leverkusen with a scratch team the other, far more surprisingly, stumbled an hour to the north-west. If it wasn’t the start to the week Germany’s terrace stalwarts would have ideally wanted, it was far from what Domenico Tedesco would have been hoping for as well. It’s the price of success, and you don’t make an omelette without cracking a few eggs. Yet the intrinsic fragility of late-season hopes and dreams could not have been clearer on this early summer night in Mönchengladbach. Leipzig still have the best Bundesliga record of any team in 2022, a testament to the fine work of Tedesco, but they have now been pulled back towards the pack by successive Bundesliga defeats, at the worst possible time. Freiburg had the chance to put pressure on their Champions League rivals by winning on Saturday and took advantage of the scheduling. With all their resources, and a squad looking like being perfectly calibrated for this sort of juggling act, Leipzig were unable to respond. Tedesco made five changes from the semi-final first leg win against Rangers, but his team produced a lethargic first half. “You can take the tactics board and throw it in the bin,” said the visibly frustrated coach afterwards. Seeing a side that normally play with such zest stripped of their usual vim is jarring, and it’s what we saw here. It wasn’t just the rigour of Gladbach, keen to impress after a disappointing campaign, which pressed Leipzig. This unforeseen, at least at the start of the season, return of Monday evening football (don’t call it a comeback) presented the perfect confluence of punchbags for ultras. Having seen off the detested matches on the first day of the working week as part of the new television rights deal, supporters were stuck with it again. With the police and security authorities too busy on May Day to deal with Sunday matches this week, the games of the Europa League participants were put back to Monday – and absence hasn’t exactly made the heart grow fonder for German supporters. There were plenty of empty seats (and a mere smattering of fans from Leipzig in the away section) in Borussia-Park and a banner in the Nordkurve, where Gladbach’s ultras gather, pledging Keine Akzeptanz für RB, Montagspiele & Polizeiwillkür - no acceptance for Red Bull, Monday games and police authoritarianism. And yes, Leipzig remain a target of ire too, for while they cut a stylish swathe around Europe on the field, German supporter culture has not forgotten who they are or where they come from. There was a sea of shrill whistles from the Nordkurve (as in actual whistles with a pea inside, in their thousands) every time the visitors took possession, which deafened in the game’s early stages. When the stadium announcer heralded Gladbach’s goals – a confidently struck Breel Embolo opener and a typically classy brace from Jonas Hofmann – in traditional call-and-response style with the home fans, they replied ‘null’ for Leipzig, even after Christopher Nkunku’s well-taken first-half equaliser. The fans’ message was clear: what they do just does not count. 📽️ A very impressive win from the 10 men of @Borussia_EN saw the Foals bring @RBLeipzig_EN's away winning streak to an end. 🚫➕3⃣ pic.twitter.com/GrRrIoIwLJ It is inescapable. Freiburg, Leipzig’s opponents in the DfB Pokal final as well as their competition for a Champions League place, have declined to lend their support to the traditional half-and-half scarf for the showpiece, and one will not be produced. Before then, Tedesco must find a way to bring some much-needed clarity back to his side before Thursday’s trip to Ibrox, in which clear heads are a must. “We were too frantic in trying to get the ball into the box,” complained Willi Orbán of his side failing to take advantage of Nico Elvedi’s second-half red card, for chopping down Nkunku when clean through. Leipzig are prolific on the road but Gladbach frustrated them well with 10 men, with Hofmann’s second clinching the win despite the numerical disadvantage. There is much Tedesco can’t change about Leipzig. The image of him on the touchline here, pushing both palms downwards to appeal for calm, tells us he knows what he can do, and needs to do. Union Berlin 1-1 Greuther Furth, Hoffenheim 3-4 Freiburg, Arminia Bielefeld 1-1 Hertha Berlin, Augsburg 1-4 Cologne, Dortmund 3-4 VfL Bochum, Mainz 3-1 Bayern, Stuttgart 1-1 Wolfsburg, Bayer Leverkusen 2-0 Eintracht Frankfurt, Borussia Mönchengladbach 3-1 RB Leipzig  Freiburg had put the squeeze on their top four rivals by winning at Hoffenheim (and all but finishing the hosts’ European hopes) in a seven-goal thriller on Saturday. “It’s an amazing feeling,” said Lukas Höler, who nodded in the third from on the goalline, “and the highlight of my career so far.” He might yet have greater highlights to come. SCF have plenty of opportunity to shape their own destiny, with the final two games against their direct rivals Union Berlin and Leverkusen, with the Pokal final to come too. Christian Streich’s men can’t lose, really – whatever they manage will be a resounding overachievement.  Whether Champions League or Europa League is the final prize, it appears Freiburg are ready to step up a level with their recruitment, with Bild among those reporting that the World Cup winner Matthias Ginter will return to the club when his Borussia Mönchengladbach contract expires in the summer. He will replace Nico Schlotterbeck, whose signing for Borussia Dortmund as the latest part of their rebuild was confirmed on Monday.  Meanwhile, for the first time in just shy of four years, Bayern Munich and Dortmund both lost on a Saturday. One suspected it might be one of those rare afternoons for the champions when Julian Nagelsmann posed for selfies with fans before taking his seat on the bench prior to kick-off. Mainz certainly attacked the game with greater intensity and Robert Lewandowski breaking the record for away goals in a Bundesliga season was really the only issue of note from a Bavarian standpoint. On the same theme Hasan Salihamidžić had some defensive work to do post-match, insisting that the club still cared for sporting integrity despite the squad’s trip to Ibiza ahead of Sunday’s reception of Stuttgart – with Hertha’s Felix Magath already voicing his concerns of how engaged Bayern would be against his club’s relegation rivals.  Dortmund managed to lose their penultimate home game despite an Erling Haaland hat-trick, which put them in a winning position against Bochum having gone 2-0 down in double quick time early on. Two strikes in the last 10 minutes by Jürgen Locadia and Milos Pantović, though (the winner was a third penalty awarded from handball in the game), gave Thomas Reis’s team a famous win and confirmed they will be in the Bundesliga again next term. The players celebrated into the night with fans on Kortumstrasse. “It was pure emotion,” beamed Reis. “We did a great job this season.”  Hertha were a whisker from certain safety after Lucas Tousart’s header gave them the lead at Arminia Bielefeld – but a stoppage-time equaliser by the home side’s Joakim Nilsson, allied with Chris Führich’s explosive late leveller for Stuttgart at home to Wolfsburg, kept the gap between the Berliners and the Swabians at four points, with Stuttgart still the favourites to end up in the playoff spot, which Arminia continue to strive for.",Sport/Football,RB Leipzig on verge of glory but still a long way from national acceptance | Andy Brassell,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/03/rb-leipzig-on-verge-of-glory-but-still-a-long-way-from-national-acceptance
5/3/2022,"The Kid Laroi was the big winner at the Australian Performing Rights Association (Apras) awards on Tuesday night, taking home three awards – including the top gong in the song of the year category for his collaboration with Justin Bieber, Stay. The track, a lovelorn plea to a partner that was described by the New York Times as a “hyper-slick new wave/pop-punk hybridisation”, beat others by Amyl and the Sniffers, Hiatus Kaiyote, Genesis Owusu, and 2021 winners Midnight Oil. It became a mega-hit when it was released last July, spending 14 consecutive weeks atop the Aria charts and reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100. It has been a meteoric year for the Kamilaroi rapper, whose real name is Charlton Howard. Raised in Sydney’s Waterloo and now based in Los Angeles, the 18-year-old was nominated for best new artist at the Grammys and VMAs, performed on Saturday Night Live with Miley Cyrus, and signed – then split – with Bieber and Ariana Grande’s music manager Scooter Braun. He’s now managed overseas by Adam Leber, who also has Lil Nas X and Labrinth in his roster. At home in Australia, he was named artist of the year at the National Indigenous Music awards in November. That same month, he won two Arias for best artist and best pop release. “I’m stoked to be on my way back,” said The Kid Laroi, who is performing at Tasmanian arts festival Dark Mofo in June, amid a national tour. “I miss you all and I’ll see you soon.” Song of the year is the only peer-voted category at the Apras in a field which is otherwise mostly determined by airplay and royalty earnings. At the awards, which were held at Melbourne town hall, The Kid Laroi also won most performed hip-hop/rap work for Without You, as well as songwriter for the year – a prize given out at the discretion of the Apra board. He is the second Indigenous Australian artist – and second hip-hop act – to scoop the songwriting prize, after AB Original in 2018. Breakthrough songwriter of the year, which The Kid Laroi won in 2021, went to Genesis Owusu, whose euphoric blend of hip-hop, funk and soul has proved a winning formula in the industry. The Ghanaian-Australian musician (real name Kofi Owusu-Ansah) won last year’s lucrative Vanda & Young global songwriting competition – also run by Apra – as well as four awards at the Arias, including album of the year for his independent release, Smiling With No Teeth. The Ted Albert award for outstanding services to Australian music went to The Wiggles, for whom the past year has been particularly – and perhaps unexpectedly – fruitful. In January, they topped Triple J’s Hottest 100 with a cover of Tame Impala’s 2012 track Elephant, which included a mashup with their own chorus from Fruit Salad. They followed the victory with ReWiggled in March, an album where Australian bands – among them The Chats, Spacey Jane, and Polish Club – perform covers from The Wiggles’ discography. Currently in the midst of an 18+ Australian tour featuring their original quartet, they have courted recent attention from hitmakers like Lil Nas X, who joked about headlining with the children’s group. Tones and I won two awards for the second year running: Fly Away was most performed pop work, and her ubiquitous earworm Dance Monkey was most performed Australian work overseas. John Courtidis received two awards for the dance track Head & Heart, which he co-wrote alongside English artists Joel Corry and MNEK; Budjerah, who was named breakthrough artist at the Arias, won in the most performed R&B / soul category for his track Higher, with Matt Corby; Ziggy Alberts won in blues and roots for Letting Go; Amy Shark won in country for Love Songs Ain’t For Us; and Angus Young won in rock for Shot in the Dark, with his late brother, Malcolm Young.",Arts/Music,"The Kid Laroi, Genesis Owusu and the Wiggles dominate Australian music awards",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/03/the-kid-laroi-genesis-owusu-and-the-wiggles-dominate-australian-music-awards
5/3/2022,"Fiji’s high court has ruled that the US government can seize a superyacht believed to be owned by a Russian oligarch who faces sanctions from the US and the EU, which is docked in the Fijian port of Lautoka. Judge Deepthi Amaratunga granted the request from Fijian authorities to register and enforce US warrants to seize the Amadea, which has been docked in Lautoka since 13 April and which is believed to belong to Suleiman Kerimov, who is considered a close ally of Vladimir Putin. The vessel with a crew of at least 25 was fined by Fijian authorities for breaching immigration regulations when it entered Fiji in early April after an 18-day voyage from Mexico. The defence claimed the yacht is owned by Eduard Khudainatov, who is not facing sanctions. The defence lawyer Faizal Hanif, acting for the Amadea’s registered owners Millemaria Investment Ltd, asked the court for a stay on the ruling, expressing fears that US authorities would sail the vessel out of Fiji. The judge indicated he would grant a stay order and insist the vessel remain in Fiji during the 30-day appeal period.

5/3/2022,"It seems like every few months brings news of another defeat for the UK government in the courts. And there may well be more to come – the latest policy in the sights of lawyers and activists is the plan to process certain asylum seekers who’ve arrived on Britain’s shores in Rwanda in east Africa. The policy was met with justified outrage from progressives and the left. Specialists also predicted that it would run afoul of international law and human rights legislation. But what if this was part of the plan all along? The Times columnist Clare Foges, writing under the headline “Rwanda won’t work: but it will for Boris Johnson”, wondered if the real purpose of the plan was not to actually reduce perilous journeys across the Channel, as the government claimed, but to draw progressives into extended court battles and lawsuits. This would force them to act as an explicit blockade on post-Brexit migration policies, frustrating the “people’s will” ratified by the 2019 election, and thereby galvanising Tory activists and potential voters.This poses an uncomfortable question for the left: what if its increasing embrace of the justice system is not just a sign of political weakness, but rather a gift to the right? Johnson is hardly alone with this tactic. In Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro’s term as president has been marked by a recognisable pattern of improbable initiatives followed by protracted leftwing resistance in courts. In Belgium, Flemish nationalists such as Theo Francken, the former secretary of state for asylum, have repeatedly attacked judges who have thwarted plans to deport asylum seekers. By forcing opponents to lawyer up instead of building movements and pursuing state power, the right can pose as the defenders of an assailed, disfranchised majority. This leftwing embracing of the courts makes sense on one level. In the face of rightwing attempts to restrict basic human rights, the justice system has some of the more powerful tools. Immigration policy is not unique in this regard. Over the past decade, green activists have begun pressing claims against a variety of state actors to hold them accountable for climate inaction. Given the issue’s urgency, it is understandable that ecologists would examine a wide repertoire of tactics. Context matters, however. Historically, courts were usually the left’s last resort. They offered a pivot when all other routes had been exhausted or political circumstances were simply too hostile. The left relied on a densely organised civil society of unions, parties and councils which could fight opponents on their own terrain. These parties and unions could run in elections, strike or rewrite constitutions. Yet they were always sceptical of the idea that progress could be achieved through the courts alone, or that judges were the most reliable guardians of popular power. In the past 40 years, as these bastions of worker power have atrophied or died out, the left has become isolated and weak, populated by a small caste of professionals – many of them lawyers and academics – who only have a tenuous connection to an organised constituency. In this sense, the embrace of judicial power is itself the expression of political weakness. In the 1990s, the “third democratic wave” elevated the ideal of independent courts, together with market economics, to a sacred criterion for membership in the global democratic community. In the 2010s, however, disillusionment with courts became endemic across young and old democracies, from the Polish government’s decision to handpick judges to the controversies around the German constitutional court and its queasiness about looser EU budgetary rules. The US provides a helpful example of the drawbacks with trying to secure progressive gains through the courts. The country is somewhat unique in that its abortion rights were achieved through supreme court action rather than directly elected majorities. In several European countries, parties that supported abortion rights had to run in elections across the 1970s and 1980s, thereby facing a direct, democratic test from voters. Once these parties won office, it was easier to get anti-abortion activists to acquiesce to the new regime. There had been a fair contest, and the losers had to accept the result. In the US, by contrast, conservatives repeatedly felt as if abortion rights were imposed by judicial coup. This encouraged political backlash, and allowed anti-abortion activists to claim a fresh democratic mandate. This does not imply that conservatives are strangers to the opportunistic usage of courts. Many of the authoritarian threats of the 2010s came from ideologically driven judges. The right in Latin American is especially keen on “lawfare”. A variety of trends may well decrease the vote share of rightwing parties in the near and distant future. In Britain, persistently low wages and a cost of living crisis do not make for great electoral prospects. Faced with these demographic and economic trends, the Conservative party (and other rightwing outfits) could increasingly prefer its opponents to fight them on the terrain of courts and judges. This is an easy option: it allows rightwing parties to pose as the representatives of a frustrated majority, while camouflaging their own anti-democratic plans – to gerrymander voting districts, for instance, or even to introduce tests at the voting booth. Scepticism about judicial power should not make progressives cynical about what can be achieved through the law. There are important battles that should be fought in courts. Yet if progressives are serious about offering a real political alternative, they will be better off focusing on the (re)building of durable institutions, rather than appealing to the moral conscience of high judges. Courts will not always be their best friend – sometimes, they might even be an enemy.

5/3/2022,"The NFL has announced that it found “no evidence” the Cleveland Browns purposely lost games or offered bonuses to do so after their former head coach, Hue Jackson, alleged in February the team tried to lose during the 2016 and 2017 seasons. The league said on Monday that a 60-day independent review determined “none of the allegations could be substantiated.” Former US Attorney Mary Jo White led the investigative team. Jackson went 3-36-1 in two-plus seasons for Cleveland before he was fired eight games into the 2018 season. Jackson had claimed Browns owners Dee and Jimmy Haslam incentivized people in the organization to lose over a four-year period. Jackson later softened those comments. The investigation concluded there wasn’t evidence supporting Jackson’s claims the team “tanked” during those seasons, and the club’s ownership or football personnel “made no decisions deliberately to weaken the team to secure a more favorable draft position.” The Browns went 1-15 in 2016 and lost all 16 games the following season under Jackson. The poor run allowed the team to secure the No 1 overall pick in the 2017 and 2018 drafts, which they used to select star players Myles Garrett and Baker Mayfield. White and other lawyers interviewed Jimmy Haslam along with current and former members of the organization. The league said Jackson initially agreed to meet with investigators before deciding against it. The investigators had access to Jackson’s public statements and filings and testimony in a prior arbitration proceeding. The league said the Browns also provided documents, including emails, texts, internal memos and presentation decks to assist the inquiry. The Browns have consistently denied Jackson’s assertions, and said they are pleased with the investigators’ findings. “We appreciate the independent investigation led by Mary Jo White and the Debevoise team which brings closure to these allegations that Hue Jackson publicly recanted shortly after they were made and that we’ve known all along are categorically false,” said team spokesman Peter Jean-Baptiste. “As we’ve previously stated, we welcomed this investigation because the integrity of our game is something that should not be taken lightly and an independent review was crucial in bringing a conclusion to this matter.” Tanking is a tacitly acknowledged practice in the league: NFL teams in a rebuilding phase often trade away their best players, something that usually leads to poor results and better draft selections with which to build for the future. However, deliberately losing is a different matter and would be hard to achieve as, aside from their competitive pride, players and coaches know their future employment in the NFL depends on producing results. Deliberately losing in order to fix bets is a federal crime and Jackson at no point suggested gambling was a motivating factor when he went public with his allegations. Jackson’s allegations came after former Miami Dolphins head coach Brian Flores said he was offered $100,000 bonuses to lose by the team’s owner, Stephen Ross. The Dolphins have denied those claims. Flores’ allegations were part of a lawsuit that alleges the NFL and its teams discriminate against Black head coaches and the league is run like “a plantation”. Jackson is currently coaching in college football at Grambling.",Sport/Sport,NFL investigation finds no evidence Browns deliberately lost games,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/03/nfl-investigation-cleveland-browns-hue-jackson-tanking-allegations

5/3/2022,"A cruise ship touring Australia’s Top End has become the site of a Covid outbreak, offloading more than a dozen positive passengers in Darwin. The 93-metre Coral Geographer anchored in Darwin Harbour early on Tuesday with 74 guests and 38 crew on board after a trip through the Kimberley region. Northern Territory Health confirmed 17 guests and crew had contracted the virus, since the ship embarked from Broome 10 days earlier. Cruise operator Coral Expeditions said the infected passengers isolated onboard during the voyage as required under NT and Western Australian law. “NT Health was advised of the detection and management of cases on board throughout the voyage,” a spokesperson said. “Affected guests and crew were provided care by onboard medical specialists.” The infected passengers and crew were transported to an undisclosed location, reported to be hotels, in Darwin to complete their isolation periods. All guests and crew returning negative Covid-19 tests disembarked as normal. Coral Expeditions said all were fully vaccinated. Coral Expeditions said it had safely operated more than 100 cruises through the pandemic without incident. The latest cruise ship outbreak, however, comes less than two weeks after another of Coral Expeditions’ ships was also the site of a Covid-19 outbreak when docked in Broome last month. Western Australian authorities were required to contain an outbreak affecting an undisclosed number of the ship’s 72 passengers and unknown number of crew on the Coral Discoverer. Coral Expeditions Commercial director Jeff Gillies told the NT News on Tuesday that the company had complied with directions from NT and WA Health. “In the NT, maritime vessels are permitted to allow positive cases and close contacts to safely disembark and move to suitable accommodation to complete their isolation requirements,” Gillies said. “This was managed in Darwin by Coral Expeditions who arranged transport and lodgings in a safe manner and in full collaboration with health authorities.
