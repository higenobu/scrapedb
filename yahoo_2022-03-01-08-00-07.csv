3/1/2022,"Russian billionaires Mikhail Fridman and Oleg Deripaska are protesting the invasion of Ukraine. They're the first Russian business leaders to do so, as sanctions target the country's elite. The US and NATO are attempting to cut off Russia's finance, energy, metal, and diamond industries. Billionaires Mikhail Fridman and Oleg Deripaska are speaking out against the war with Ukraine — making them some of the first Russian business leaders to push back against Putin's military invasion. The rare protest from Russian elites comes as the US, Canada, and European nations impose ""severe"" sanctions on the country's economy and finance systems. On top of targeting the Russian economy and financial systems, the sanctions are also taking aim at prominent Russian oligarchs and their Western assets. One day after the invasion of Ukraine, Russia's 22 richest individuals lost a combined $39 billion. Now, the Russian economy is facing a financial meltdown. Video: People worldwide are protesting Russia's invasion of Ukraine Fridman, who founded Russia's largest private bank and currently runs LetterOne, a private equity firm, said ""war can never be the answer"" in a letter to employees first reported by the Financial Times on Sunday. ""I do not make political statements, I am a businessman with responsibilities to my many thousands of employees in Russia and Ukraine,"" the Ukrainian-born investor wrote, per the FT. ""This crisis will cost lives and damage two nations who have been brothers for hundreds of years."" Fridman is one of Russia's richest men, and is the 183rd richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. While he currently is not personally targeted by US sanctions, Bloomberg reported that Fridman may be one of those named in upcoming sanctions from the EU. Deripaska, who made his billions from Russian aluminum company Rusal, said ""peace is very important"" in a Telegram post on Sunday, adding that peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia should begin ""as fast as possible."" The Russian oligarch has been personally named on the US sanctions list since 2018, when the US Treasury designated him as having connections to the Russian government and state energy sector. He sued to have the sanctions repealed, after they ""devastated"" his wealth and business reputation, The Wall Street Journal reported. Ten oligarchs in Putin's inner circle were sanctioned on Thursday, including prominent CEOs of Russia's state-backed oil and diamond mining companies.

3/1/2022,"(Reuters) - About 800 people were arrested as Belarus voted to ditch its non-nuclear status in a referendum that raises the stakes at a time when the country has become a staging ground for the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the government said on Monday. The vote sparked the biggest protests in months as thousands took to the streets in Belarus, where President Alexander Lukashenko has imposed a sweeping crackdown on dissent after a contested election challenged his grip on power in 2020. The vote to change the constitution, passed by 65% according to official data, could see nuclear weapons on Belarusian soil for the first time since the country gave them up after the fall of the Soviet Union. It comes at a time when Lukashenko has fallen in line behind Russian President Vladimir Putin's military assault on Ukraine after earlier playing an intermediary role between the two neighbours. ""Despite the numerous calls from destructive Telegram channels to destabilize the situation, which were spread by citizens outside the country, mass protests did not happen. Police officers were focused on prompt response and suppression of provocations,"" the interior ministry said. The new constitution also gives powers to an assembly created by Lukashenko and populated by party loyalists, officials and pro-government activists, and gives lifetime immunity from prosecution to the president if he leaves office. On Sunday, speaking at a polling station, Lukashenko said that he could ask Russia to return nuclear weapons to Belarus. ""If you (the West) transfer nuclear weapons to Poland or Lithuania, to our borders, then I will turn to Putin to return the nuclear weapons that I gave away without any conditions,"" Lukashenko said. Lukashenko's rival in the 2020 vote, exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, had called on Belarusians to use the referendum vote to protest against the war against Ukraine, which Russia calls a ""special operation"" to disarm Kyiv. In videos and photos posted on social media, dozens of people gathered at polling stations in Minsk and other cities in Belarus on Sunday. Several videos showed the crowd chanting ""No to war"". ""There is little we can do now, with all this terror and horror in which we live. But I wouldn't forgive myself if I didn't try to do something. We are already considered accomplices,” said Elena, 45, who came to one of the polling stations along with a couple of dozen people. She declined to provide further information about herself for security reasons. The West has already said it will not recognise the results of the referendum.

3/1/2022,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday he will release prisoners who have “real combat experience” to help fight the war against Russia. Zelensky said in a video address that everyone who is able to “join the struggle against the invaders must do so,” including prisoners who will be freed to help with the “struggle for our state.” “Under martial law, Ukrainians with real combat experience will be released from custody and will be able to compensate for their guilt in the hottest spots of the conflict,” Zelensky said, according to the Daily Mail. “We have taken a decision which is not easy from the moral point of view, but which is useful from the point of view of our defenses,” he said, adding that the “key is now defense.” The Ukrainian president also again asked the European Union to immediately allow Ukraine to join the bloc. “We appeal to the European Union for the immediate accession of Ukraine via a new special procedure,” he said in the video address. “Our goal is to be together with all Europeans and, most importantly, to be on an equal footing,” Zelensky added. “I’m sure it’s fair. I’m sure it’s possible.” The address came as Russian and Ukrainian officials prepared to meet on the Ukraine-Belarus border on Monday morning for peace negotiations. The talks ended without a clear resolution as the Russian invasion raged on. Ahead of the talks, Zelensky confirmed his country’s objective for the negotiations was an “immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of Russian troops.” Zelensky did not participate in the talks, though the country sent its defense minister and several high-ranking officials to meet with a Russian delegation. While the parties did not agree on a ceasefire, a top adviser to Zelensky said the two sides would meet for a second round of peace talks after each delegation returns to its respective capital to discuss the other side’s demands. Russian negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said Russia wants to reach an agreement that serves both parties. The Russian invasion, which began Thursday, had killed at least 352 Ukrainian civilians as of Sunday, according to Ukraine’s Ministry of Interior.
