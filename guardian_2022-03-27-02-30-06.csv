3/27/2022,"This utterly enthralling match can be bluntly characterised as a contest between Bath’s free-flowing, offloading ambition and Sale’s Springboks-style crushing power. It is a touch more complicated than that, of course, but in searching for their third straight win, Bath spent much of the afternoon trying to prove that brawn can be bypassed by skill and pace. In the end, when Faf de Klerk’s last-ditch penalty faded inches wide, there was nothing to choose between them. Perhaps that was right. Arguably, neither team deserved to lose such a scintillating game. Sale’s hopes of the playoffs took a dent as De Klerk’s kick sailed wide, while Bath remain stuck at the bottom of the table despite Sam Underhill’s two tries on his return from Six Nations duty with England. The early signs had been ominous for Neal Hatley’s side: although Rob du Preez missed an early penalty, it wasn’t long before the influential Bath No 8, Nathan Hughes, was shown a yellow card for a high tackle on Arron Reed. De Klerk had been getting his hands on the ball regularly early on and Sale, as a result, took control. The Springboks No 9 injected pace around the fringes and kept the Bath defence honest with some searching box-kicking. After a powerful drive in the corner, Sam James fed Luke James and he stepped inside to crash over under the posts. But Sale would not have it all their own way. A sublime one-handed offload by the young Bath lock, Ewan Richards, to Underhill rather summed up the host’s approach and they grew in stature when Hughes returned from the sin bin. Hughes was denied a try for a knock-on at the previous ruck but happily from a Bath perspective, Underhill was soon bludgeoning his way over the try-line, and Danny Cipriani converted to level at 7-7. Bath were bubbling and Underhill soon dived over for his second. Cipriani clipped the conversion through the posts and Bath had impressively battled back in front. After the referee, Hamish Smales, sent Sale’s Ben Curry to the sin bin after some persistent infringing by the visitors, Ben Spencer’s opportunistic 50-22 kick gave Bath position for a third five-pointer. Spencer spun the ball to Jonathan Joseph, who fed Cipriani. The former England fly-half nearly made it to the line himself but instead teed up de Glanville and it was 21-7 at half-time. If Sale were hoping to make their power count after the interval, it did not take them long. After Will Butt was tackled in the in-goal area, a couple of meaty carries saw Jean-Luc du Preez rumble over. Rob du Preez missed the resulting conversion and Sale were back in it: even more so when Rohan Janse van Rensburg crashed over the line to bring Sale within four points at 21-17. Kicking duties this time were for de Klerk, and he also missed, but Bath continued to be pinned back in their own 22, and as the clock ticked into the final 15 minutes, Ewan Ashman was the latest Sale forward to power over. De Klerk converted – and Sale edged ahead, 24-21. Sale, again, shoved themselves into the Bath 22 but a momentum-shifting penalty allowed Bath to stream down into the away 22 and when Tom Roebuck was penalised for offside at a ruck, Cipriani, who had produced a stunning back-of-the-hand pass to keep the previous move flowing, cracked over a simple conversion. It was 24-24 – and Sale’s understudy kicker, de Klerk, could not steal maximum points with his late, late effort at goal.",Sport/Sport,Late Danny Cipriani penalty secures Bath a draw in thriller against Sale,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/26/bath-sale-premiership-rugby-union-match-report
3/27/2022,"Owen Farrell capped his first appearance since November with 12 points as Saracens squeezed past Bristol in an entertaining clash to cement their hold on second place in the table. The Bears thought they had won the match with a dramatic try in the final minute, but the last pass from the captain Joe Joyce to Jack Bates was adjudged to be forward and Saracens could breathe again. It was the right decision by the referee Christophe Ridley but, ultimately, heart-breaking for Bristol, who stuck in the fight against a Saracens side who struggled to find top gear. They had their moments but will be pleased to get away with the victory and to have welcomed Farrell back for 70 minutes at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. When he made way, Saracens had a four-point lead thanks to two tries from Max Malins, energised again after he was axed by Eddie Jones for England’s final Six Nations match against France. Farrell had survived a scare when a high tackle on Piers O’Conor was reviewed and his afternoon was cut short by a head injury assessment. His director of rugby, Mark McCall, will just be happy to see Farrell back on the field, however. Not to mention Jones. Farrell’s left leg was heavily strapped and, though he took the kick-off, he took a little while to establish himself in the match. He was hesitant when receiving a high kick from Bristol and, before he had time to get rid of the cobwebs, Bristol were a try to the good. It was no less than Pat Lam’s side deserved, Antoine Frisch powering past Nick Tompkins a little too easily for McCall’s liking and dotting down under the posts. Farrell was instrumental in Saracens’ swift response, however. He swivelled on a wayward pass expertly before shipping on to Ben Earl, who released Malins down the right. It was not an easy finish but Malins made it look simple, raising the question as to why England were not able to put him in similar situations before he was axed during the Six Nations. Farrell added an excellent conversion from the right-hand touchline. All told, it had been a scrappy start. Saracens could not impose themselves and an overthrown lineout from Jamie George was gratefully received by his opposite number Harry Thacker in a promising position. A few seconds later Frisch released O’Conor on the left for Bristol’s second try. Two Farrell penalties and one for Bristol’s Tiff Eden kept the visitors ahead, before the latter was on hand to finish off their third try after some lovely footwork from Frisch which left Elliot Daly bamboozled. He soon had his revenge, however, finishing off after a crisp Farrell pass had put Alex Lozowski in space. Farrell converted for 20-20 at half-time in a contest that was coming to the boil nicely. Saracens moved ahead when Malins took a flat pass from Alex Goode for his second try of the match after the break, prompting Bristol to turn to their bench and introduce both Charles Piutau and Semi Radradra. The Bears found themselves pounding away at the Saracens line shortly after, but robust defence from the hosts kept them out. Bristol did bring themselves back to within four points with a penalty from the replacement fly-half Calum Sheedy after Farrell was penalised for a high tackle on O’Conor – Ridley took a closer look on the big screen but ultimately decided no further punishment was warranted. With 10 minutes to go Farrell was withdrawn for a head injury assessment, having stayed down after taking the ball into contact. He appeared to be clutching his left ankle but a HIA was announced as the reason for his early departure. Saracens seemed to be cruising to the full-time whistle, regardless, until Joyce found himself galloping in behind the hosts’ defence in the final minute. He did the right thing in looking to find Bates on his right, but his pass was forward and Bristol’s euphoria was short lived.",Sport/Sport,Max Malins double sees Saracens edge Bristol in six-try thriller,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/26/saracens-bristol-premiership-rugby-union-match-report
3/27/2022,"Rishi Sunak has put in place one of the essential building blocks of a Tory victory at the next general election – a cut in income tax. During his Commons speech last week, the chancellor was cheered by backbench Conservatives, who believe the promise of a 1p cut in the basic rate to 19p before the likely date in 2024 would improve their chances of re-election. But Sunak, always keen to portray himself as a tax cutter at heart, came in for ridicule once independent figures showed that the average household would pay more tax in two years’ time, even with the 1p reduction in place. That will be ensured by next month’s rise in national insurance contributions and a four-year freeze on personal tax thresholds, which means more earned income is subject to tax. Never mind, say Sunak supporters, 1p is just the opening bid. Once the recovery from the pandemic is in full flow, and the inflationary spiral triggered by the Ukraine war has abated, a clampdown on public spending over a couple of years will allow for a 2p or even 3p cut. In an increasingly uncertain world, it is understandable when hard-pressed families are tempted to vote against tax rises. When the government says there is little it can do to protect them and the businesses they work for, and uses its full might to denounce those who propose exploiting low interest rates to fund extra support by borrowing more, demands for lower taxes are expected to grow. Only a few months ago, Sunak would have been forgiven for believing he would be leading the Conservatives into that election. The party’s tolerance of Boris Johnson’s persistent lying was growing thin and it seemed likely he would be ditched before the year was out. Boris may still get the boot, but the chancellor cannot bank on it, and for the time being must sell his idea of jam tomorrow to a sceptical crew in No 10, keen to spend big now. He must also sell it to a sceptical public, one that cannot consider giving his party their vote in two years’ time while turning down the central heating today. Sunak was given a helping hand last week by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the forecasting unit set up by one of his predecessors, George Osborne, to take the politics out of estimating the effect of government policy on the public finances and the economy more widely. The OBR has faced criticism in the past for underestimating the impact of cuts to public services, public sector wages and welfare on the economy and on business confidence. Between 2010 and 2016 it consistently overestimated business investment growth, then was forced to review its calculations and admit that UK business investment – and productivity growth – had been hit for six by the 2008 crash. In their most recent judgment, published with the chancellor’s spring statement last week, OBR officials were again chomping on the happy pills, arguing that worker productivity – measured as output per hour – was likely to grow by 1.3% on average. This may not sound high, but compared with the 0.7% average growth rate in the decade after 2010, it is extremely optimistic. And when business investment has stayed at or close to zero for so long, it is difficult to see where the funding for such productivity growth will come from. This year could be different. The OBR expects a major tax break on business investment to spark a 10% revival this year. But it is a one-off – as with so many of his government’s initiatives – and its effect will soon fade. The OBR also expects consumers to override the uncertainty surrounding the end of the pandemic and the Ukraine war and start spending their savings. There could be as much as £150bn of the estimated £250bn built up during the pandemic left to spend. Samuel Tombs of consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics says: “The recent sharp fall in consumers’ confidence makes it hard to justify such a large downward revision to the saving rate.” Without the forecast increase in business investment and productivity, and a consumer spending splurge, Sunak’s economic recovery will be much diminished. Tombs says the OBR will be forced to revisit its forecasts and expects downgrades to be on the menu. That will spell disaster for a chancellor who has chosen to accept criticism for his parsimony today as a reasonable price for plaudits before the next election. His tax cuts would be unaffordable, or revived only using the borrowed money. The gamble would be a flop, and his party would probably pay a high price.",News/Business,Sunak’s ‘jam tomorrow’ offer won’t taste sweet in 2024 | Phillip Inman,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/26/sunak-jam-tomorrow-offer-wont-taste-sweet-2024
3/27/2022,"Two weeks into the Russian invasion, as millions of Ukrainians fled their homes and headed west, artist George Butler began his own journey in the opposite direction. Travelling light, his dip pens, watercolours, Indian ink and drawing board stashed in his customary shoulder bag, he took a flight from London to the city of Iasi in Romania, then jumped on a bus to Chișinău, the Moldovan capital. Another long and very crowded bus journey took him to Odesa in southern Ukraine, where he stayed for a few days before continuing on an overnight train to Kyiv, at the heart of the conflict. ‘This scene was outside a Kyiv supermarket a few hours before the 36-hour curfew earlier this month. It’s a long queue because everybody was trying to get in as much food as possible before the lockdown. It’s a very typical scene at the moment. You also see long queues at cashpoints that limit people to 200 Ukrainian hryvnia [about £5].’ Talking to him via Signal while he is under curfew in the apartment that has been lent to him by a Kyiv resident, my first question is: why? What made him undertake such a perilous journey into a living nightmare that others are desperate to escape? ‘The Opera and Ballet theatre is easily the most beautiful building in Odesa, now surrounded by sandbags and these big black tank hedgehogs that are made by volunteers in factories around the city. They’re cut out of old railway line and put all over the streets and it is impossible for tanks to move through them. Painted or welded on to all of them is the phrase: ‘Russian warship, go fuck yourself.’ That’s become a real slogan. You see it everywhere.’ “I guess doing my job is a compulsion,” he says. “I think it’s the same for photojournalists and journalists who cover conflicts. We want to tell stories that otherwise we assume would not be told. That’s always been my intention in Syria, in Afghanistan, in Yemen and all the other places I’ve worked in before.” Butler has been illustrating what happens in war zones, refugee camps and conflict situations in beautiful, delicate ink and watercolour paintings since he embedded with the British army in Afghanistan at the age of 21. His work has been published in newspapers and magazines all over the world and shown at the Imperial War Museum and the V&A. He dislikes the term ‘“war artist” and prefers to describe himself as a reportage illustrator. “The reality is that I draw what is going on around the margins of war,” he says. “I think there is always space around the edges of these vulnerable, sensitive places to tell longer, slower, quietly observed stories, a visual account of what is going on there. It is not all about tanks and helicopters being blown up – it is about what happens at the fringes of atrocity.” As Butler waited in Odesa station last week to catch the overnight train to Kyiv, a scene of the kind he is drawn to played out. “The 8pm curfew had begun and it felt eerie in the darkness. Then a man called Volodymyr took out his acoustic guitar and started playing some Ukrainian songs and people began singing along. The guard came along and told him to be quiet but everyone said no, let him play. So he played and his friend handed out flowers, pink tulips, to every woman in the crowd. It was this extraordinary moment.” ‘Watching and listening to this guitarist in Odesa station, I was struck by the contrast between what was happening in front of me and the fast-moving stuff we’ve seen on our front pages and on TV screens this past few weeks. This was the human element of war, the stuff that happens away from the frontline.’ While Butler has the utmost respect for photographers, he believes that an illustration of the effects of war drawn over a couple of hours offers a different perspective. “It’s not the snap of a shutter and then walking away. You can’t ‘steal’ a drawing. Everything has to be done with the permission of the people in the image. It’s gentle and open. It’s unthreatening.” ‘This is the cafe in Odesa food market. It is totally set up for now for hundreds of young volunteers that are coming through and donating their time. A lot of them work in the morning and then come in in the afternoon to help. All those sort of orange hi-vis are all volunteers. They are packing up donations from civilians and from shops and putting them into boxes and sending them to military units, territory defence, across the country.’ Yesterday, in Kyiv, where you can hear thuds of artillery in the background all day, Butler went out with two volunteers, one a human rights lawyer and the other a mother, who were delivering aid to anyone who couldn’t leave their homes. “We visited a woman called Madame Olga. She was 99 and she was terrified of anybody coming into her house because she thought they would be coming to take her away. She wanted to stay in her home, whatever the situation. As I drew her, she told me she was too frail to move down into the bomb shelter when there was an air raid so she and her daughter just stayed in the flat and hoped that any bombs would miss. That is the civilian cost of what is going on. Madame Olga is not at war, but war is very much part of her life. ‘This is Madame Olga, 99. She is almost completely blind and deaf, She doesn’t want to leave her flat so she stays there through the air raids with her daughter, 79, hoping the missiles will not find them.’ “She’s 100 in August and she invited us to her birthday. She lived through the Great Famine – the Holodomor – and the second world war and now she is going through this. She told me she is so worried that she forgets the words to describe how she feels. The anxiety is so great she can’t explain it. It was very moving and I think that is an example of a drawing being a gentle way into sitting with someone and listening to what they’re saying. That’s not to say it can’t be done with a camera, but I hope that drawings offer a different dimension.” George Butler’s work in Ukraine is part-funded by the Pulitzer Centre for Crisis Reporting Drawn Across Borders: True Stories of Migration by George Butler is published by Walker Studio (£15).

3/27/2022,"Who Is Aldrich Kemp? BBC SoundsI Must Have Loved You BBC Radio 4Some Kind of Black BBC Radio 4Kiss Breakfast with Jordan & Perri Kiss FMHits Radio Breakfast with Fleur East Hits FM In search of a bit of fun last week, I listened to Julian Simpson’s five-part drama Who Is Aldrich Kemp?. I’m a fan of Simpson’s The Lovecraft Investigations – three series of incredibly engaging, madly spooky mysteries, based on the stories of HP Lovecraft – but Aldrich Kemp doesn’t form part of those. At least, not entirely. What Simpson has done is create a spy/crime caper that overlaps ever so slightly with his Lovecraft world. You know how the Marvel universe has different superhero gangs operating in different films and occasionally there’s an intersection? It’s like that. When it happens in Aldrich Kemp, if you’re familiar with the Lovecraft cast, it’s a delight. You hear a new voice, you think: “Is that…?” and then the character introduces themselves and they are exactly who you’d hoped. I found myself shouting “Yes!” Even if you have no idea about the overlap (it happens at the end of episode 2), the series appeals on its own merits. Which are many: it’s gripping, funny, with charismatic characters and lickety-split pace. It’s also ludicrously far-fetched, in a 1970s James Bond/The Avengers manner. We meet dashing cads who greet adversity with quips as well as bullets, baddies who want to reshape the world for no particular reason and well-spoken old ladies who are more violent than they might appear. Tea and cake are offered before shoot-outs. It’s a hoot from start to finish. The plot – and yes, it’s ridiculous – is this: secret service researcher and excellent fencer Clara Page is sent to find Aldrich Kemp, who’s the leader of an underground criminal gang. Kemp, it turns out, lives in a house (hice) in the country (cantreh) where everyone, from butler to shopkeeper, turns out to be part of his gang. Page keeps being given drinks that knock her out and coming to in sillier and sillier situations. There are dead bodies, comatose bodies, bodies who appear to be one person and turn out to be another. Simpson, who directs as well as writes, is very good at sound: there are entire shoot-outs constructed simply through click-click noises and “come on, old chap” quips. Plus, as this is radio drama, he can go full tonto; people drop from a helicopter on skis, a mountain lair is blown up, a baddie decides to kill his enemies by flooding a room with water. The film costs would be millions upon millions. Aldridge Kemp, in contrast, was recorded on location in Brighton, for, one imagines, a budget that would struggle to get into four figures. But the mind pictures were fabulous and I enjoyed myself throughout. Bolstered by such fun, I thought I might try out some regular Radio 4 drama and went for the full Saturday afternoon 90 minutes with I Must Have Loved You. No Aldrich Kemp effect, sadly: no wit, no pace, no purpose, no charm. The big pull was Sting (he co-created the show with writer Michael Chaplin), playing Vince, a (dead) blues musician: he was fine in his role and his repurposed songs were nicely recorded. But a weak story and dreary writing let every thing down. Perhaps just tune in for the music. Last week’s Saturday afternoon drama was distinctly better. Some Kind of Black, a two-parter, has been adapted byDiran Adebayo from his own wonderful 1996 novel and tells the story of Dele and his sister, Dapo. It suffered a little in its translation into a radio play. Dele moves between very different social worlds in London and Oxford; sadly, those worlds weren’t very differentiated, audio-wise (a bit of chatter and chinking glasses does not a party make). And Kenneth Omole, playing Dele, occasionally struggled for the necessary depth of emotion. But this is a great tale, nicely adapted, plus, for any 90s music fans, there are some excellent tunes. For more light relief, here are a couple of breakfast shows that keep things upbeat. Jordan and Perri on Kiss FM have long been a bright and breezy tonic in the mornings. And over on Hits, a station I’ve only recently started listening to, Fleur East is brilliant (listen out for her “rap roulettes”). Both stations bring in every listener through banging music selection and an inclusive attitude. Lovely stuff.",Arts/Television & radio,The week in audio: Who Is Aldrich Kemp?; I Must Have Loved You; Some Kind of Black,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/26/the-week-in-audio-who-is-aldrich-kemp-i-must-have-loved-you-some-kind-of-black-kiss-breakfast-jordan-perri-hits-radio-fleur-east
