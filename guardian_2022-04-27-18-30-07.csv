4/27/2022,"Game developers say they were not consulted before the Coalition announced plans to change the classification of video games with loot boxes. Labor criticised the timing of the pre-election announcement, with the opposition and industry advocates saying the government sat on a review of Australia’s outdated classification system for close to two years. The communications minister, Paul Fletcher, said on Wednesday a re-elected Coalition government would update Australia’s classification code which, apart from allowing R-ratings for video games in 2013, has not been updated since the VHS era. The changes would “address a range of issues” including the use of loot boxes in video games – where people can pay money for in-game mystery boxes with items that can be collected and used in the game. The proposed changes would include a minimum classification rating for games that simulate gambling. The changes would also address content that sexualises children or depicts suicide or violence against women. “The government’s priority is keeping Australians safe online, so having clearer advice alerting parents and other consumers to the presence of in-game purchases, such as loot boxes, will help them manage their and their children’s engagement with this content,” Fletcher said. “This isn’t about banning or censoring content: it’s about ensuring families can make more informed choices.” The federal government undertook a broad-ranging review of the classification system in December 2019, with submissions open until February 2020. Since then, the government has not responded to the submissions, despite bringing in the Online Safety Act in the interim two years. The act relies on the system to determine what content can be viewed online and what social media platforms must remove. Ron Curry, the CEO of the Interactive Games and Entertainment Association, said the organisation had worked closely with the Coalition government on the 2019 review and was still waiting to see the results. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He said the association was not consulted prior to Wednesday’s announcement, but welcomed the opportunity for another public consultation. “We would like to note though, that this is a cooperative scheme and any government would need agreement from each of the states and territories before changes can be made,” he said. “It is not a unilateral decision of the federal government.” Fletcher said the changes would be informed by “consultation with families and communities, experts in fields relating to child wellbeing, industry and other key stakeholders, and state and territory ministers, as required under the National Classification Scheme.” Labor’s shadow minister for communications, Michelle Rowland, said the announcement showed the government wasn’t serious about protecting consumers, or it would not have sat on the classification review for two years or “waited until the eve of an election” to make the announcement. “The review of the classification scheme … has not been released or responded to by the Morrison government, some two years later,” she said. “Australians and their families rely on classification ratings to inform choices about they and those in their care watch, read and play. “Under Scott Morrison, work to ensure the scheme reflects modern content and delivery platforms has fallen hopelessly behind and simply has not been completed.” Rowland said the government had been given many opportunities to act on loot boxes alone since 2019, including after a Senate inquiry and a House of Representatives inquiry into age verification. Sex workers and others who post adult content online had previously warned that the current classification system, when enforced under the Online Safety Act, will lead to their content being censored or removed online. Samantha Floreani, the program lead at Digital Rights Watch, said the classification system is “outdated and not fit for purpose” and the changes should have been made before the Online Safety Act was passed into law. “This is yet another example of the Morrison government’s kneejerk approach to tech policy. We need comprehensive tech policy development with safety mechanisms like privacy, security, and community empowerment at the centre,” Floreani said. “Instead, we are getting a reactive and piecemeal approach to online safety that results in complex schemes with multiple moving parts.”",News/Australia news,Coalition to change classification code for video games with loot boxes two years after review,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/27/coalition-to-change-classification-code-for-video-games-with-loot-boxes-two-years-after-review
4/27/2022,"The Business Council of Australia insists the so-called safeguard mechanism is “the right incentive” to put Australia successfully on the path to net zero emissions, after Scott Morrison sought to weaponise climate action by branding his own policy a “sneaky carbon tax”. The group representing Australia’s top corporates weighed in after Coalition figures were publicly at loggerheads about whether or not the Morrison government had made a firm commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050, with the Nationals senator Matt Canavan declaring the policy “all over bar the shouting”. Renewed climate brawling came as the government braced for an interest rate hike during the closing weeks of the election contest after the Australian Bureau of Statistics confirmed on Wednesday that inflation is running at the highest level since the introduction of the goods and services tax over 20 years ago. Labor rounded on the government after the new inflation number was released, accusing Morrison of presiding over a damaging trifecta of rising prices, rising interest rates and stagnant wages. The last time interest rates were hiked during a federal election was in 2007 and John Howard went on to lose the contest. Morrison has sought to turn the election conversation back to economic management, but Wednesday’s developments complicate the government’s core message. The Coalition is also battling sustained controversy after Solomon Islands signed a new security pact with China and the fresh internal eruption over climate policy. With opinion polls suggesting both parties are bogged down at the mid-point, Morrison has moved in recent days to reignite the climate wars. The prime minister has claimed Labor’s climate policy, which would require heavy emitters currently covered by the Coalition’s safeguards mechanism to either reduce their emissions or offset them more quickly, is a “sneaky carbon tax” that would penalise large polluters. But the BCA countered on Wednesday: “The safeguard mechanism is already in place alongside a suite of other measures to reduce emissions, with careful consultation with industry we believe it is the right incentive to drive investment, deliver more jobs and meet our net zero commitments.” The BCA’s intervention was backed by another major business association, the Ai Group. A spokesperson pointed Guardian Australia to previous public advocacy, including a call for the safeguard mechanism, first introduced by Tony Abbott, to be “built on as a driver of long-term abatement within industry and the wider economy”. Morrison’s intention to train the political focus on Labor’s tweaks to the safeguard mechanism has also been disrupted by Nationals publicly querying the government’s bona fides on net zero. The prime minister and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, who faces a challenge in his metropolitan electorate from a “teal” independent, have been forced to slap down suggestions from Nationals that the Coalition’s commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 isn’t serious. Campaigning in Rockhampton in Queensland, in the safe Coalition-held seat of Capricornia, Morrison dismissed Canavan’s intervention saying “everybody knows” that he was not supportive of the government’s position on net zero. “There’s no news there, and as many have said today, as the treasurer has said today, that’s not the party’s position, that’s not the Coalition’s position and it’s not the government’s position,” he said. “That debate has been done in the Coalition, and it is resolved and our policy was set out very clearly, and it has the strong support of the government.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Canavan was also rebuked by the former Nationals leader Michael McCormack who told the ABC the Nationals had signed up to the net zero target – and agreements needed to be honoured. The MP for Capricornia, Michelle Landry, whose seat is one of the country’s biggest coalmining electorates, said she supported the government’s net zero commitment and told Canavan: “Pull your head in, Matt.” But back in Canberra, the Nationals Senate leader, Bridget McKenzie, reopened an old internal battle, telling the National Press Club she could support government funding for new coal-fired power stations if teamed with carbon capture and storage. City-based Liberal MPs are strongly opposed to taxpayers subsidising new coal plants. Asked about a new coal power station in the Hunter – a seat the Nationals are attempting to wrest from Labor – McKenzie said: “If it is going to be a coal-fired power station that is much lower in emissions because we’re actually employing carbon capture and storage technology, then why wouldn’t we support that?” But she added: “I’m not suggesting that we’re setting up coal-fired power stations on every street corner that don’t result in lower emissions.” McKenzie also told the press club while the Coalition was locked in behind a net zero commitment it would be “a mistake” to believe the progression would be linear because it may be an “up and down process” depending on the emergence of new technologies. Previous election contests suggest the weaponisation of climate policy benefits the Coalition’s political standing in Queensland and in regional and outer suburban political contests. Facing potential losses in the Liberal party’s progressive metropolitan heartland because of the government’s suboptimal climate policy and failure to deliver a national integrity commission, Morrison is clearly targeting Labor-held seats in the regions and suburbs. In a speech to the Rockhampton chamber of commerce on Wednesday, Morrison targeted the “green left”, reminding voters of the Adani convoy that toured central Queensland at the last election, stoking fears about Labor’s commitment to coal jobs in the region. Morrison declared that if Labor won the election he had a “fear for the way of life” of people in the regions. The United Australia party leader, Craig Kelly, accused the Coalition of being in “complete disarray” on the net zero target. “The Liberals are the senior Coalition partner and the prime minister made this change but they’re having a bet each way and continue to say something different to regional constituents,” he told Guardian Australia. “Perhaps because they’re bleeding votes to UAP – they’re running to this con job that there is wriggle room.”",News/Australia news,Business backs government climate policy that Morrison says is a ‘carbon tax’ when attacking Labor,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/27/business-backs-government-climate-policy-that-morrison-says-is-a-carbon-tax-when-attacking-labor
4/27/2022,"Well, it’s happening then: Elon Musk, one of history’s least inspiring Saturday Night Live hosts, has agreed to buy Twitter for approximately $44bn. I cannot in any realm understand why he has decided to buy the website I go to every day to embarrass myself on, but this is less about the deal and more about Musk himself: not uncool, exactly (although it is impossible to be cool and be a billionaire, and yes this does include Rihanna), but a man who creaks and vibrates with a desperate-to-be-liked-by-the-cool-kids energy that most of us shook off towards the end of secondary school. I should not be able to so palpably see that a billionaire wants me to like him. I should just be living in a constant terror that he is going to explode the moon, like every good billionaire should always be threatening to do. Anyway, now is as good a time as any to assess the state of Twitter: it is not dead but definitely dying, and not because Musk has bought it (though the fact that Twitter was willing to effectively sell Twitter is frankly a red flag). The thing with social media platforms is that every one of them eventually dwindles down to something removed from the original bright kernel of the idea that made them – it is such a shame that David Fincher made such a cool film about the founding of Facebook, which is now just essentially a car boot sale that Candy Crush mums and dads “who remember proper bin men” get radicalised on – and Twitter is no different: the bizarre way the timeline never loads in sequential order; that doomed experiment with “fleets”; the fact that every viral tweet eventually sours – the user who tweeted it choosing like clockwork to sell galaxy projectors in a sponsored follow-up post. But also, fundamentally, Musk is buying Twitter at a time when the written word is going away: Twitter started to lose out years ago to Instagram, which did “interacting with people” and “showing off about your life” a lot better than Twitter ever did; Instagram itself has since been elbowed out of the spotlight by TikTok, with its all-seeing algorithm and the fact that advertisers haven’t quite figured out how to ruin it yet. If you have something to say on the internet now, it’s better to say it to camera with closed captions and an elastic facial expression than typing it out in an affected lower-case font. Elon Musk may as well have just bought a Gutenberg press. So what can Musk do to Make Twitter Great Again? So far he has made some vague statements about “freedom of speech”, which most people are reading as “reactivating Donald Trump’s Twitter account” (to be fair, he is a world-class poster), and suggested he’s interested in an edit button, which functionally would be a disaster. Hearing Musk talk about Twitter’s “tremendous potential” in 2022 is very reminiscent of every NFT bro’s pitch deck for a doomed crypto island: a lot of buzzwords, a lot of baseless trust in the future of tech, and the strange feeling that you are somehow being scammed. In five years’ time the only things Musk will have done are change the character limit to 420, permanently banned me for writing this, and turned his blue tick purple. But here’s the most powerful (and coolest, by the way) thing Musk can do with the website: delete it, or at least get whichever Tesla engineer was responsible for those cars catching fire to build new servers so it deletes itself. Twitter is nearing its endgame because it has changed the way discourse works on its platform so it is now eating itself: people are in a daily race to have the most unhinged or worst possible faith interpretation of any major event (“Elon Musk is Will Smith and Twitter is Chris Rock. We are all Jada” – some moron who is about to get 250,000 likes, probably), the way many of us process politics is irreparably changed, and frankly every single user on there, myself included, needs to go outside and touch grass. If Musk deleted Twitter, the masses wouldn’t flock to whatever not-quite-as-good written platform that forms to fill the void: they’ll go outside, finally unclench, stop trying to view every event through the cursed prism of hot takes and content (and maybe get into TikTok). Elon Musk thinks he’s just bought the planet’s town square, the news empire to end all other news empires, but he’s lost sight of the fact that he’s also bought a website where I can just post the word “shart” and get about 30 to 40 likes. Twitter has the potential to be a free speech haven by making every stupid thought anyone can possibly articulate equally important as any other thought, sure. But I think it would be better to absolutely not have that, in any way at all.

4/27/2022,"When Laura Fulcher went to A&E in 2014, doubled over in agony, she was desperate for answers. She had been suffering from stomach pains and bowel changes for more than a year, with no medical support or investigations. “I overheard a nurse saying there were no ‘real patients’ in A&E that night,” she remembers. “I was sent home feeling guilty for wasting their time.” A few months later, a colonoscopy was finally arranged, which revealed an advanced tumour in her bowel. It required invasive surgery and aggressive chemotherapy, leaving her with adhesions: painful scar-like tissue in her abdomen. Before she became unwell, Fulcher had been forging a successful career as a secondary school English teacher. When the first niggles of pain began in 2012, when she was 29, her GP was quick to diagnose irritable bowel syndrome. As her condition deteriorated, with terrible pain, bleeding and exhaustion, she visited her Warwickshire GP surgery a total of nine times over the course of a year. “They said it wasn’t serious and, because I felt like I was being difficult, I was apologetic, diminishing my experience.” By the summer of 2013, Fulcher was so unwell she was forced to leave her job. In October, she travelled to South America, hoping the break would heal her. “One day, I started haemorrhaging. I went to a pharmacist and listed my symptoms. She was horrified. She told me to go back to the UK and get help straight away.” But back home, the sense of urgency wasn’t shared by the GP she saw. “I was referred for further testing but it took a long time. The doctor told me there were 70-year-olds waiting for tests who could have cancer, and they had to come first.” In March 2014, five months after she was referred for investigations, an ultrasound showed abnormalities and she was offered a colonoscopy. “I saw this grotesque, bleeding mass on the screen and, through a haze of pain, my first thought was relief. Finally, I had proof it wasn’t all in my head. Then the consultant told me it was likely to be cancer.” Fulcher quickly realised she would have to become her own advocate. Despite the side-effects of treatment, which left her with extreme fatigue, she found the path to diagnosis and the aftermath of cancer significantly more traumatic. “I felt cared for during my treatment. It was a case of having a focus – you go into survival mode. When the treatment finished, I was in remission and I expected to feel ecstatic. Instead, I felt alone. I was left to recover [by myself] physically and psychologically – and this is when things fell apart. I’ve since discovered that most people find the end of treatment just as difficult as the time of diagnosis.” Fulcher went looking for support via the NHS and cancer charities, but found nothing suitable available. “With cancer often presented as a ‘battle’, there’s no place for the stories of what happens afterwards and the long, hard slog of recovery.” In 2016, she took matters into her own hands and set up Mission Remission, a grassroots charity supporting people to move forward after cancer treatment. Its online hub shares hundreds of practical strategies and inspirational testimonies on everything from dealing with fatigue and nausea, to going back to work and coping with anxiety. The charity also offers advocacy support, hosts a vibrant online community, runs support groups as well as an online book club, and has a campaigning team. “This year, we’re focusing on fitness motivation, working with a cancer rehab personal trainer to run fitness drop-ins,” she says. Another huge challenge for cancer survivors is the anxiety around possible recurrence. “You’re expected to feel grateful, but how can you when you live in constant fear that cancer will return?” Fulcher’s fears were realised in 2018 when she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. It was treatable, but it left her feeling even more scared for the future. “I now have a one-year-old little girl. When I think about the cancer coming back, my worry is all for her. I know others feel the same.” In addition to offering support for those feeling anxious, positive stories can offer hope to others, and help them find meaning again. “For me, getting a camper van and travelling around the country, as well as setting up the charity, were part of my recovery. For others it might be family or fishing. It’s important to know there can be life after cancer.” The charity is run mostly by volunteers, and supported with small grants from funders such as the national lottery. More than 22,000 people have been helped by Mission Remission to date, and it has an active membership of 15,000. In 2020, Fulcher also launched Something’s Not Right, a campaign that aims to speed up cancer diagnosis by ensuring that “people worried about symptoms know how to best champion themselves and doctors know to take the words ‘something’s not right’ seriously”. “My aim is for no other person to wait 15 months for diagnosis,” says Fulcher. “People often think that improving cancer diagnosis is an impossible task and that nothing can change until more innovative tests are rolled out, but that’s just not true. There were so many missed opportunities to help me, and our campaign focuses on the missed opportunities that so many of our community have faced.” According to Cancer Research UK, more than a third of cancers are diagnosed late due to delays in referrals or late presentation of symptoms, while figures from the British Medical Journal show that every month a diagnosis is delayed raises the risk of death by 10%. GPs can refer patients to hospitals through different routes. One of them is the speedy “cancer pathway”, which usually means you get to see a specialist within two weeks – but Public Health England found that, even before the pandemic, more than 50% of cancer patients were not referred along this pathway or flagged by GPs as “urgent”. Over the past two years, Mission Remission has been commissioned to help the NHS to improve early diagnosis in several regions. “In our recent survey, 65% of people told us they were not clearly instructed that they needed to return to their GP if symptoms didn’t clear up. This is one of our calls for change – every GP appointment needs to end with ‘next step’ discussions: when to return if symptoms don’t clear up,” says Fulcher. An NHS spokesperson confirmed staff had met with Fulcher and Mission Remission as part of efforts to ensure every patient gets a follow-up plan that suits their needs and can access clinical support if they are worried about symptoms. The spokesperson said: “Earlier diagnosis is a key priority and the NHS is seeing more people than ever for urgent cancer checks.” The NHS long-term plan for cancer states that “after treatment, the person will move to a follow-up pathway that suits their needs, and ensures they can get rapid access to clinical support where they are worried that their cancer may have recurred”. In September 2020, the NHS launched a nationwide cancer quality of life survey, speaking to people 18 months after diagnosis. It aims to improve early diagnosis rates via new testing methods, and encouraging people to come forward for routine tests. Last year, Mission Remission worked with the NHS in Hackney to determine what changes people wanted to see in cancer services. The charity is now helping to enact 16 recommendations, including counselling referrals during every health appointment, and offering treatments for chemotherapy side-effects. Despite the challenges Fulcher faces as a result of her own late diagnosis, her determination and strength seem to vibrate through her small charity and those she works with. “It’s easy to think: ‘Oh, we’ve just been through a pandemic – improving services is impossible. But that’s nonsense. The NHS was founded just a few years after the second world war. It is first about believing change can happen, then finding the power to act.”",News/Society,‘As a cancer survivor you’re expected to feel grateful’: Laura Fulcher’s campaign for better care,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/27/cancer-survivor-laura-fulcher-campaign-better-care
4/27/2022,"Apale winter sun shines through my office window. I sigh deeply. Even though I am one of the most successful men of my generation with one of the most demanding jobs imaginable, deep inside I have never felt quite so alone. How I long for someone who understands the real Matt. I quickly get a grip. There is no point feeling sorry for myself. The NHS isn’t going to run itself. I fall to the floor to do eight press-ups, before returning to my desk. On the TV screen, a reporter runs a brief story about a new flu in China. I yawn. That could never happen here. Not while I am in charge of the country’s health. The so-called coronavirus has spread to the UK. Just as I predicted. The prime minister rings to ask if I have any contingency plans for a pandemic and if hospitals and GPs’ surgeries have enough personal protective equipment. I reply that I have everything well in hand. I have arranged for all elderly patients in hospital to be discharged into care homes and have personally checked that there are enough masks for every doctor to have two. One to wear, one to wash. That should do it. My breathing is laboured. Much like my prose. And I also have a temperature. I think I have Covid. But I don’t want to make a fuss. So I just sit at home and continue to work in the brief, fleeting moments that I am awake. The phone rings. It’s Grant Shapps. I tell him I’m feeling a little better. He says that he doesn’t care about me. What he wants to know is whether the PM is OK. Boris sends me a WhatsApp message telling me I’m completely fucking hopeless, only to quickly send another one saying he is still a bit delirious and to forget that. I smile and reflect on how the pandemic is bringing the whole country together. I have returned to work feeling invigorated and even more determined to control Covid. I am now committed to wasting more than £40bn on a useless track-and-trace programme and to creating an app that tells everyone the NHS is near breaking point and that morale among doctors and nurses has never been lower. We have now reached 50,000 deaths and the UK is top of the mortality leaderboard! By an extraordinary coincidence, it turns out that Gina Coladangelo, an old friend from university, has started working with me to help me improve my emotional intelligence. She thinks that the public will respond to my press conferences better if they can see my vulnerability rather than being distracted by my rugged good looks. I casually pick up an office chair and do some biceps curls. I think she’s impressed. I’ve begun writing poetry. “My darling, beloved, sweet Gina / I’ll never forget the time I first seen her …” The death toll has now reached 60,000 and I have agreed with the prime minister that Dominic Cummings was right to drive for an hour to test his eyesight, but all I can think of is Gina. I feel there is an electrical connection between us. That she gets me in a way no other woman ever has. If only I wasn’t so shy about making the first move. I feel vaguely guilty about my wife but fortunately can’t remember what her name is, so the moment passes. It’s a casual day in the office and I put on my smartest pressed Levi’s and a black turtleneck sweater. I start singing: “He’s a smooth operator.” OMG. I can’t believe it. Dreams do come true. I never dared to hope my feelings might be reciprocated but Gina loves me as much as I love her! It went like this. We just happened to be sharing a sandwich alone together at lunch when my hand accidentally brushed her knee. “I thought you’d never make a move, my gorgeous, hunky Milk Tray Man,” she whispered. Within seconds our bodies were entwined, our tongues darting ravenously as we devoured one another. “You complete me, Gina,” I said afterwards, using my last reserves of emotional intelligence. “You are my rock, Door Matt,” she replied. “I’m always hard for you,” I said, tensing my six-pack. “But right now I should probably congratulate the cricketer Daniel Rashford. And perhaps I should put you on the departmental payroll.” “You can’t put a price on our love.” “I think you can. How about £15k?” Much of the rest of the year passes in a blur, though I do manage to nearly cry on TV when the first vaccines are administered. It is so humbling to think it was all down to me that the UK was the first country to start a vaccination programme. Inevitably there are the naysayers, with Cummings saying I should have been fired for 15 to 20 different things. But with Gina by my side, I can rise above it. How we try not to make love in my office every night! We know it is so wrong, that we are breaking lockdown rules, but somehow it feels so right. Our love cannot be denied. It is almost a relief when the CCTV footage of our passion is released. Who cares if the death toll is over 150,000? Now our love will be the love that can be named. “I’m standing right by you,” says the prime minister. “I’d never sack anyone for having an affair. Especially not myself.” “Thank you, thank you,” I sob, before correcting him. Ours is not a tawdry affair. It is a beautiful romance. “Actually,” says Boris, “I’ve been told to sack you after all. No hard feelings and that.” “Thank you, thank you. Do what you will with me. I’ll always stand by you because I’m spectacularly needy. If ever you need me back, I’m all yours.” And so it is that the pandemic comes to an end a year later. Even though 600 people still insist on dying of Covid each day and the NHS is still on its knees. “You must be so proud of the difference you’ve made,” Gina says, as we feast on each other’s bodies. “I’m now thinking of taking in some Ukrainian refugees,” I reply. “Don’t you think they’ve suffered enough?”",News/Politics,"‘The UK is top of the mortality leaderboard!’: Matt Hancock’s Covid memoir, as seen by John Crace",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/27/matt-hancock-covid-memoir-as-seen-by-john-crace
4/27/2022,"Dominic Raab has come under pressure over the UK government’s failure to come up with policies to tackle the cost of living, while not ruling out higher defence spending. The deputy prime minister was on Wednesday questioned on the government’s lack of big ideas to deal with the cost of living crisis and high inflation, after a cabinet brainstorming session came up with a string of minor policy tweaks. Pressed on why he could not name any new policies, Raab told Times Radio: “What I would say is, in fairness, it’s quite right that cabinet discusses, thrashes through, these ideas and the subcommittees of cabinet do. “I think … people expect us to test our policies very carefully, to thrash them through, and keep coming up with new ways to ease the pressure.” Later in his broadcast round, Raab did not dismiss a call from Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, for Nato countries to look at higher defence spending in light of the war in Ukraine, after she suggested 2% of national income on defence should be a “a floor, not a ceiling”. In Tuesday’s brainstorming cabinet, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, had suggested making MOTs on vehicles once every two years, saving about £40, while Boris Johnson backed proposals to let nursery staff look after more toddlers each to help bring down childcare costs. Other suggestions included cutting green levies on energy bills in spite of the UK’s net zero target, while Kit Malthouse, the policing minister, pushed for more tax cuts, backed by Jacob Rees-Mogg. The government’s suggestions were criticised by Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, who said it had “lost the plot” if it thought its ideas would make a substantial difference to people’s lives. “Our problem is a big cost rise for almost everyone that is harder for low/middle income households to bear. So the answer is either reducing that cost rise for, or raising the income of, those households. The benefits system is by far the easiest way to do that. Obviously,” he said. Raab insisted the government already had a £22bn package to deal with the cost of living and dismissed Labour’s planned windfall tax on oil and gas companies to help bring down energy bills as “disastrous” and damaging to investment. He pointed to the taper rate of universal credit and the rise in the national living wage. However, the government is under intense pressure over the issue weeks after Rishi Sunak’s spring statement failed to offer substantial help for households at a time when inflation is running at about 7%. Despite the chancellor’s insistence that the crisis must be solved without any more cash, Truss will give a speech on Wednesday pushing for higher defence spending in light of Russia’s war in Ukraine. She is due to say the west must prepare for the “long haul” to ensure Russia’s defeat in Ukraine, calling for allies to increase defence spending and supply tanks and warplanes to Kyiv. Truss also argued that there had been a “generation of under-investment” in the west and the 2% target should be “a floor, not a ceiling”.",News/Business,Raab under pressure over lack of action on cost of living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/27/dominic-raab-under-pressure-lack-action-cost-living-crisis
4/27/2022,"The historic £400m debt the UK paid to Iran at the time of the release of British-Iranian dual nationals Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori has still not reached Tehran, according to Iranian government sources. A senior Iranian government source said the money was blocked in Oman and the problem was not with the UK government. One report said only £1m had been transferred to Tehran. The UK made it a condition that the money would be used only for humanitarian purposes, but this condition was not repeated in a statement at the time by the Iranian government. Oman acted as a mediator in the talks that led to the transfer of the longstanding debt at the time of the release of the two UK detainees on 17 March. Both sides maintained that the payment of the 40-year-old debt and the release were not linked, but many said this was a diplomatic fiction. The UK refused to comment directly on Iranian media reports but pointed to previous UK and Iranian government statements that the debt had been paid with accrued interest. Questioned by the Iranian newspaper Entekhab, Mahmoud Abbaszadeh Meshkini, the spokesperson for the Iranian parliament’s national security and foreign policy commission, said the money was blocked. “We are working with the countries of the region in some way, and some neighbouring countries are consulting and mediating in receiving our demands,” he said. He said it was important that the blocked money was released. The extent of the hold-up is not clear and it is unknown whether it is due to a banking problem in Oman or another issue, such as the limits set on the use of the money by the British. The Foreign Office has stressed that the payment “was made in full compliance with UK and international sanctions and all legal obligations”. The Iranian government also said at the time that it “had full authority and freedom on how to spend its financial resources”. There had been speculation that the UK may be withholding full release of the funds because it believes Iran has not kept its side of the negotiated bargain that should have allowed a third British-Iranian, Morad Tabhaz, indefinite leave to be on furlough at his family home in Tehran, rather than requiring him to stay in prison. But the UK has always said there is no link between the debt and the release of the detainees, so it would be difficult for London to explicitly make such a link now. Tabhaz went on a nine-day hunger strike after his return to jail, but his future seems tied up with stalled wider talks about the revival of the Iran nuclear deal in Vienna. Tabhaz also has US citizenship and the Iranians appeared unwilling to release him as part of the deal that led to the release of Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Ashoori. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, thought that as a compromise she had reached an understanding that Tabhaz, an environmentalist arrested in January 2018 and jailed for 10 years, would be allowed out of jail on furlough. However, he was returned to jail after only two days on release. The Iranians said there may have been a misunderstanding within his family. The UK foreign affairs select committee is due to hold an inquiry into how the UK handled the detainees’ case, but it is not yet clear how much it will examine the issue of state hostage-taking in general or the specific handling of past consular cases by ministers and officials.

4/27/2022,"When the job of a young east coast-based analyst – we’ll call him James – went remote with the pandemic, he didn’t envisage any problems. The company, a large US retailer for which he has been a salaried employee for more than half a decade, provided him with a laptop, and his home became his new office. Part of a team dealing with supply chain issues, the job was a busy one, but never had he been reprimanded for not working hard enough. So it was a shock when his team was hauled in one day late last year to an online meeting to be told there was gaps in its work: specifically periods when people – including James himself, he was later informed – weren’t inputting information into the company’s database. As far as team members knew, no one had been watching them on the job. But as it became clear what had happened, James grew furious. Can a company really use computer monitoring tools – known as “bossware” to critics – to tell if you’re productive at work? Or if you’re about to run away to a competitor with proprietary knowledge? Or even, simply, if you’re happy? Many companies in the US and Europe now appear – controversially – to want to try, spurred on by the enormous shifts in working habits during the pandemic, in which many office jobs moved home and seem set to either stay there or become hybrid. This is colliding with another trend among employers towards the quantification of work – whether physical or digital – in the hope of driving efficiency. “The rise of monitoring software is one of the untold stories of the Covid pandemic,” says Andrew Pakes, deputy general secretary of Prospect, a UK labor union. “This is coming for almost every type of worker,” says Wilneida Negrón, director of research and policy at Coworker, a US based non-profit to help workers organize. Knowledge-centric jobs that went remote during the pandemic are a particular area of growth. A survey last September by review site Digital.com of 1,250 US employers found 60% with remote employees are using work monitoring software of some type, most commonly to track web browsing and application use. And almost nine out of 10 of the companies said they had terminated workers after implementing monitoring software. The number and array of tools now on offer to continuously monitor employees’ digital activity and provide feedback to managers is remarkable. Tracking technology can also log keystrokes, take screenshots, record mouse movements, activate webcams and microphones, or periodically snap pictures without employees knowing. And a growing subset incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) and complex algorithms to make sense of the data being collected. One AI monitoring technology, Veriato, gives workers a daily “risk score” which indicates the likelihood they pose a security threat to their employer. This could be because they may accidentally leak something, or because they intend to steal data or intellectual property. The score is made up from many components, but it includes what an AI sees when it examines the text of a worker’s emails and chats to purportedly determine their sentiment, or changes in it, that can point towards disgruntlement. The company can then subject those people to closer examination. “This is really about protecting consumers and investors as well as employees from making accidental mistakes,” says Elizabeth Harz, CEO. Another company making use of AI, RemoteDesk, has a product meant for remote workers whose job requires a secure environment, because for example they are dealing with credit card details or health information. It monitors workers through their webcams with real-time facial recognition and object detection technology to ensure that no one else looks at their screen and that no recording device, like a phone, comes into view. It can even trigger alerts if a worker eats or drinks on the job, if a company prohibits it. RemoteDesk’s own description of its technology for “work-from-home obedience” caused consternation on Twitter last year. (That language didn’t capture the company’s intention and has been changed, its CEO, Rajinish Kumar, told the Guardian.) But tools that claim to assess a worker’s productivity seem poised to become the most ubiquitous. In late 2020, Microsoft rolled out a new product it called Productivity Score which rated employee activity across its suite of apps, including how often they attended video meetings and sent emails. A widespread backlash ensued, and Microsoft apologised and revamped the product so workers couldn’t be identified. But some smaller younger companies are happily pushing the envelope. Prodoscore, founded in 2016, is one. Its software is being used to monitor about 5000 workers at various companies. Each employee gets a daily “productivity score” out of 100 which is sent to a team’s manager and the worker, who will also see their ranking among their peers. The score is calculated by a proprietary algorithm that weighs and aggregates the volume of a worker’s input across all the company’s business applications – email, phones, messaging apps, databases. Only about half of Prodoscore’s customers tell their employees they’re being monitored using the software (the same is true for Veriato). The tool is “employee friendly”, maintains CEO Sam Naficy, as it gives employees a clear way of demonstrating they are actually working at home. “[Just] keep your Prodoscore north of 70,” says Naficy. And because it is only scoring a worker based on their activity, it doesn’t come with the same gender, racial or other biases that human managers might, the company argues. Prodoscore doesn’t suggest that businesses make consequential decisions for workers – for example about bonuses, promotions or firing – based on its scores. Though “at the end of the day, it’s their discretion”, says Naficy. Rather it is intended as a “complementary measurement” to a worker’s actual outputs, which can help businesses see how people are spending their time or rein in overworking. Naficy lists legal and tech firms as its customers, but those approached by the Guardian declined to speak about what they do with the product. One, the major US newspaper publisher Gannett, responded that it is only used by a small sales division of about 20 people. A video surveillance company named DTiQ is quoted on Prodoscore’s website as saying that declining scores accurately predicted which employees would leave. Prodoscore shortly plans to launch a separate “happiness/wellbeing index” which will mine a team’s chats and other communications in an attempt to discover how workers are feeling. It would, for example, be able to forewarn of an unhappy employee who may need a break, Naficy claims. But what do workers themselves think about being surveilled like this? James and the rest of his team at the US retailer learned that, unbeknownst to them, the company had been monitoring their keystrokes into the database. In the moment when he was being rebuked, James realized some of the gaps would actually be breaks – employees needed to eat. Later, he reflected hard on what had happened. While having his keystrokes tracked surreptitiously was certainly disquieting, it wasn’t what really smarted. Rather what was “infuriating”, “soul crushing” and a “kick in the teeth” was that the higher-ups had failed to grasp that inputting data was only a small part of his job, and was therefore a bad measure of his performance. Communicating with vendors and couriers actually consumed most of his time. “It was the lack of human oversight,” he says. “It was ‘your numbers are not matching what we want, despite the fact that you have proven your performance is good’… They looked at the individual analysts almost as if we were robots.” To critics, this is indeed a dismaying landscape. “A lot of these technologies are largely untested,” says Lisa Kresge, a research and policy associate at the University of California, Berkeley Labor Centre and co-author of the recent report Data and Algorithms at Work. Productivity scores give the impression that they are objective and impartial and can be trusted because they are technologically derived – but are they? Many use activity as a proxy for productivity, but more emails or phone calls don’t necessarily translate to being more productive or performing better. And how the proprietary systems arrive at their scores is often as unclear to managers as it is to workers, says Kresge. Moreover systems that automatically classify a worker’s time into “idle” and “productive” are making value judgments about what is and isn’t productive, notes Merve Hickok, research director at the Center for AI and Digital Policy and founder of AIethicist.org. A worker who takes time to train or coach a college might be classified as unproductive because there is less traffic originating from their computer, she says. And productivity scores that force workers to compete can lead to them trying to game the system rather than actually do productive work. AI models, often trained on databases of previous subjects’ behaviour, can also be inaccurate and bake in bias. Problems with gender and racial bias have been well documented in facial recognition technology. And there are privacy issues. Remote monitoring products that involve a webcam can be particularly problematic: there could be a clue a worker is pregnant (a crib in the background), of a certain sexual orientation or living with an extended family. “It gives employers a different level of information than they would have otherwise,” says Hickok. There is also a psychological toll. Being monitored lowers your sense of perceived autonomy, explains Nathanael Fast, an associate professor of management at the University of Southern California who co-directs its Psychology of Technology Institute. And that can increase stress and anxiety. Research on workers in the call centre industry – which has been a pioneer of electronic monitoring – highlights the direct relationship between extensive monitoring and stress. Computer programmer and remote work advocate David Heinemeier Hansson has been waging a one-company campaign against the vendors of the technology. Early in the pandemic he announced that the company he co-founded, Basecamp, which provides project management software for remote working, would ban vendors of the technology from integrating with it. The companies tried to push back, says Hansson – “very few of them see themselves as purveyors of surveillance technology” – but Basecamp couldn’t be complicit in supporting technology that resulted in workers being subjected to such “inhuman treatment”, he says. Hansson isn’t naive enough to think his stance is going to change things. Even if other companies followed Basecamp’s lead, it wouldn’t be enough to quench the market. What is really needed, argue Hansson and other critics, is better laws regulating how employers can use algorithms and protect workers’ mental health. In the US, except in a few states that have introduced legislation, employers aren’t even required to specifically disclose monitoring to workers. (The situation is better in the UK and Europe, where general rights around data protection and privacy exist, but the system suffers from lack of enforcement.) Hansson also urges managers to reflect on their desire to monitor workers. Tracking may catch that “one goofer out of 100” he says. “But what about the other 99 whose environment you have rendered completely insufferable?” As for James, he is looking for another job where “toxic” monitoring habits aren’t a feature of work life.",News/Technology,‘Bossware is coming for almost every worker’: the software you might not realize is watching you,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/27/remote-work-software-home-surveillance-computer-monitoring-pandemic
4/27/2022,"The NFL draft sells hope. In fans’ imagination draft prospects are anything they want them to be. When the draft starts in Las Vegas on Thursday, fans can dream that their team is one pick, one draft class away from becoming a Super Bowl contender. That is the kindest reading, the one that views the draft as a way to ensure competitive balance, of the league legislating parity. Another reading: it’s an exercise in wage suppression, giving as much money as possible to veterans at the expense of the young pups coming into the league. Some may say that it also serves as a way for the league and its franchises to exert control over new employees from the outset: they don’t get to choose where they’ll work or live; they’re sent to whatever outpost is dictated to them, their income decided by the rookie wage scale. That imbalance has shifted somewhat over the last 18 months. College football is in a state of flux. The advent of Name Image and Likeness (NIL) and the option to transfer schools penalty-free have given student-athletes a degree of agency. Soon, college athletes could unionize. And if they do, the relationship between collegiate athletics and professional sports will change. But the power still lies with the NFL and the colleges. At present, college football acts, in essence, as the NFL’s minor league system, but without any of the associated costs. That structure works for the schools and the NFL: The league gets to bring in ready-made stars, ones churned out by the college football machine; that machine has power because players have to stay in college for at least three years before turning professional. The NFL’s idea of overhauling the process is having players taken to the draft night podium on boats rather than walking. But there are plenty of structural changes the NFL could make to ensure a fair deal for their new entrants while maintaining its guise of parity. How about switching from a draft order to an allocation pool? Rather than handing teams draft picks in sequential order, they’re handed a budget to spend how they wish. It is then up to the team to decide how to allocate that budget, and up to the draftees to determine which is the best landing spot for them, weighing up the cash, scheme fit, culture, and all the traditional trappings that go into a free-agent’s decision. The league could look at two options. A weighted system that gives the team with the worst record in the league the largest pool of money to spend in the draft, with a sliding scale down to the Super Bowl champion, or a flat-rate system that hands every franchise the same amount of money. The former is the most appealing as a spectacle: Would a high-caliber quarterback turn down the Lions, for instance, in favor of taking less money to head to New Orleans? What new market inefficiencies would pop up? Is spending big on three-to-four high-profile players better than adding 13 rookies in one go. There are obvious counterarguments. The league may lose the razzamatazz of its primetime special where the picks flow in order. But that could be replaced with a new kind of experience. Who wouldn’t love the spectacle of the Star Quarterback of Tomorrow throwing a Jets hat to the floor to don a Falcons cap after a last-second sales pitch from Arthur Blank? Try as the Dolphins and Browns might, it is hard to ‘tank’ – intentionally losing games to get a better draft position – in the NFL. And even if a team wants to tank and does tank – perhaps incentivizing their coach to do so – there are no guarantees. In basketball, where tanking first rose to prominence, the highest concentration of Hall of Fame talent comes from the top picks in the NBA draft. Given that there are only 10 players on court at any given time, star players in the NBA exert more control on the outcome of a game than in any other major team sport. It’s why tanking is considered a viable strategy, and why the NBA felt the need to institute (and then amend) a draft lottery, offering percentage chances at the top slot based on a team’s record the previous year. No longer can a team tank to guarantee the top pick. In the NFL, the only player with a similar sphere of influence is the quarterback. Tanking for a high-level quarterback is smart, in theory. But it requires teams to be sure who the high-level quarterbacks are. All indications suggest teams are guessing just as much as fans when it comes to which prospects turn out to be stars. And even when teams land the sure thing, it’s only one step in the team-building process. Even the best quarterback can only impact the outcome so much compared to basketball stars, who play on both sides of the ball. Still: In light of the Brian Flores-Hue Jackson allegations leveled at Miami and Cleveland, it would be sensible for the league to cut off any further sense of teams tanking by introducing a lottery system. Plus, in the league’s quest to hit $25bn of revenue by 2027, adding a draft lottery would offer another multimillion-dollar TV vehicle. On the surface, the NFL’s age limit makes sense. It requires players to be three years removed from high school before they are eligible for the draft. Unlike baseball and basketball, football is a dangerous, collision-based sport, and the league does not want teenagers being bashed about by grown men. Yet the restriction is the main reason why the league can use colleges as free minor league clubs – high-schoolers have no choice but to enter the college ecosystem if they want to eventually turn professional. There is no reason why the league could not institute a rule that held players back from playing in the league for three years but made them eligible to be drafted whenever. Already, teams are lining their pockets with future draft picks in the hopes of landing at the front of next year’s quarterback sweepstakes. The top two quarterback prospects in the country are Alabama’s Bryce Young and Ohio State’s CJ Stroud. Both are ineligible to enter this year’s class but are already on teams’ radars for the 2023 draft. Young and Stroud could enter the draft this year, sign a contract, work within the practice facility and learn from the team’s veterans but not suit up on Sundays or during contact practices. Whether a team chooses to make that investment – and the trade-off of passing on someone who could make an instant impact – should be up to the teams and the prospects. As much as the NFL’s salary cap is about controlling costs, it’s also about the league’s owners protecting themselves from each other. The one time in the modern era the salary cap was removed, during the 2011 lockout, the owners came to an agreement on a pseudo-cap, shaking hands on a figure as they worked through the new Collective Bargaining Agreement. Jerry Jones and Daniel Snyder ignored it. They just couldn’t help themselves. The rookie wage scale serves a similar purpose. It is built to ensure owners don’t hand out the kind of contracts that could weight down a franchise for years to come. That’s all well and good … but where’s the fun in that? Why can’t Jones fork over a $100m deal for college football’s premier pass-rusher if he wants, so long as it fits under the league’s cap? You can make a simple argument for abolishing the draft altogether and shifting to an unfettered free-agent system, where rookies are able to extract their market value in the same way that any other free agent can.",Sport/Sport,Lottery picks and changing age limits: how to improve the NFL draft,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/27/lottery-picks-and-changing-age-limits-how-to-improve-the-nfl-draft
4/27/2022,"Some terrorists in prison enjoy status and celebrity among their fellow inmates amid a culture of fear and violence in jails in England and Wales that is being exacerbated by staffing cuts, an official review has concluded. Jonathan Hall QC, the government’s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, found that a pecking order of terror offenders can develop, based on the notoriety or charm of an extremist prisoner that means they may be held in high esteem by fellow inmates. “For some prisoners terrorism offences amount to a glamorous blow against the authorities, untainted by grubby personal motives and serving a wider purpose, giving them a distinctly heroic profile,” Hall said. Other prisoners may be drawn to some terror inmates by their “personal charm” or they may attracted to Islamist extremism but doubt the sincerity of the prison imam and are seeking what they feel is “a more authoritative version of the faith”. Some terror offenders may be seen as lending “credibility” to pre-existing groups in the prison. The review adds: “The fact that [terrorism] offenders are welcomed, rather than ostracised like paedophiles, is striking in itself, and illustrates the scale of the task in seeking to rehabilitate [terrorism] offenders and persuade them against further terrorist activity, when they are simultaneously enjoying a high status because of their previous offences.” Hall, who carried out a review of terrorist activity in jails in England and Wales, said this was happening in a “fearful” prison environment where violence was increasing and staff numbers had dramatically diminished over time. The review said the number of frontline operational prison staff was cut by 26% between 2010 and 2017. Officials say staff went from being “confident and in charge” to “fire-fighting”. Relationships between staff and prisoners deteriorated and everything became a “fight”. Among the examples of “Islamist gang-type activity” Hall identified was the case of Usman Khan, who stabbed two people to death during the 2019 London Bridge attack while out on licence following an earlier terror conviction. Hall said he tried to make connections with the notorious hate preacher Abu Hamza when they were both in prison. The review said Khan had “admitted that whilst he was in prison he tried to ‘gain sort of points’ with the terrorist Abu Hamza” by the language he used to refer to non-Muslims to “prove his extremist credentials”. It also said that “Sudesh Amman, who went on to commit the Streatham attack, considered that he had celebrity status at HMP Belmarsh on account of his terrorist conviction”. He was automatically released from Belmarsh jail, halfway through his 40-month sentence for obtaining and distributing material used for terrorist purposes. Amman was shot dead by armed undercover officers after he stole a knife from a hardware shop and began randomly stabbing members of the public on Streatham High Road, south London, on 2 February 2020. The review added: “It is impossible to avoid the issue of whether increased attention to Islamist groups will lead to Muslim prisoners feeling unfairly singled out when they association with other Muslims. That is clearly a possibility, and an outcome that officials will have to work hard to avoid. Officials should be curious, open-minded, prepared to challenge, listen and explain.”",News/Society,"Terrorism offenders ‘enjoy high status’ in prison, QC’s official report says",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/27/terrorism-offenders-enjoy-high-status-in-prison-qcs-official-report-says
4/27/2022,"Six countries are represented on this year’s Women’s prize for fiction shortlist, with Meg Mason and Elif Shafak among those in the running for the £30,000 prize. The New Zealander and the Turkish-British author are up against two Americans, one American-Canadian and a Trinidadian debut novelist. The annual prize aims to honour “outstanding, ambitious, original fiction written in English by women from anywhere in the world”, and this year’s chair of judges, Mary Ann Sieghart, was pleased by how “wonderfully diverse” the shortlist has turned out to be. But there were no tick-box exercises in the judging meetings, she stressed: “They were the books we most loved. It really is as simple as that.” The Bread the Devil Knead by Lisa Allen-Agostini (Myriad) The Sentence by Louise Erdrich (Corsair) Sorrow and Bliss by Meg Mason (Weidenfeld) The Book of Form and Emptiness by Ruth Ozeki (Canongate) The Island of Missing Trees by Elif Shafak (Viking) Great Circle by Maggie Shipstead (Doubleday) The six novels offer an “escape” from the various global crises we’ve been experiencing recently, Sieghart said – only one shortlisted title, The Sentence by Louise Erdrich, mentions the coronavirus pandemic. That’s not to say the books don’t deal with serious topics: the bestselling Sorrow and Bliss is about the impact of mental illness. But at the same time, Mason’s novel is “hilariously funny”, said Sieghart. Reading it was “a great release, given what’s happening in the rest of the world”. Settings range from Cyprus to Antarctica, while the six shortlisted novels are diverse in narrative style, too. Shafak’s The Island of Missing Trees includes sections narrated by a tree, while in The Book of Form and Emptiness, by the writer and Zen Buddhist priest Ruth Ozeki, every object speaks. Great Circle by Maggie Shipstead, which weaves together the stories of a fictional female aviator who vanishes in 1950 and the Hollywood actor who plays her in a film more than half a century later, was also shortlisted for the Booker prize last year. But each author is new to the Women’s prize shortlist – and only Shafak has been longlisted before. Alongside prolific novelists such as Erdrich, whose bookshop mystery The Sentence is her 23rd novel for adults, Trinidadian standup comedian and writer Lisa Allen-Agostini has made the list with her debut novel. The Bread the Devil Knead, written in Trinidadian patois, is about a woman who is being abused by her partner. “You might think [the dialect] would be a little bit offputting,” said Sieghart. “And yet, by about page five, you’re so absorbed in it that you almost stop noticing.” Sieghart went on to praise Allen-Agostini’s “funny” and “very humane book”, noting how reading internationally “really broadens our horizons”. “I wouldn’t have known what it was like to live with an abusive partner while running a toy shop in Trinidad if I hadn’t read [The Bread the Devil Knead]. And The Sentence is written from the point of view of a Native American woman; ditto,” she added. “I’ve just learned so much from reading these books.” The six-strong lineup was whittled down from a longlist of 16 by Sieghart and her fellow judges, the journalist Lorraine Candy, novelist and podcaster Dorothy Koomson, memoirist and critic Anita Sethi and writer and broadcaster Pandora Sykes. Sieghart admitted it was difficult for the judges to choose their favourites from an “extremely good” longlist, but said the decisions were made “very amicably”, and she highly recommends all the books on the shortlist. “I’d particularly encourage men to read them,” she said, alluding to the fact that that men are far less likely to read books by female authors than women are to read books by male authors. The award was launched in 1996, after many objected to the 1991 Booker prize shortlist not including any books by women. The winner will be announced on 15 June, joining former recipients including Susanna Clarke, Eimear McBride, Kamila Shamsie and Zadie Smith.",Arts/Books,Six ‘wonderfully diverse’ novels make the Women’s prize shortlist,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/27/six-wonderfully-diverse-novels-make-the-womens-prize-shortlist

4/27/2022,"My son Charlie will be 18 soon. Like all Scottish males before him, he will be dropped on a Hebridean island with nothing but a rusty knife and his own anger. If he can’t make it back to the mainland, he will live the rest of his life among feral, abandoned Scottish sons, and he will only survive if he likes sport, because that’s how any group of men get through enforced time together. He tried sport as a kid, but as he is on the autism spectrum, he was obsessed with rules to the point where if he felt another kid broke them, he would pick the ball up and stop the game. He was basically human VAR. It never ended well. So I’ve decided I’m going to use my favourite 90s video games as a Trojan horse. And there is only one place to start. “Why is it called Sensible World of Soccer?” he asks, over the intro screen for the Xbox reboot. “Because it was the first sensible football game, in terms of controls and … er … stuff,” I fabricate convincingly. “Doesn’t look very sensible to me,” he says as tiny men run on to the pitch. “Dude, this is soooo retro!” I beat him. Twice. Not by a lot, because it is hard to score. The Xbox controller can’t match the loose-limbed brilliance of the old Cheetah Bug joystick, or maybe I’m just rubbish now. Charlie declares it “a fun, goofy little game.” Like it was something found in a Christmas cracker, rather than the Sistine Chapel ceiling of 90s sports games. “Does it make you love real football?,” I ask. “Not in the slightest.” We move on to NHL 94 Rewind. This plays like the original, but players are from recent times, so I don’t get to use Brendan Lemieux, Jaromír Jágr, Jeremy Roenick, or those others whose names we mispronounced back in the Sega Mega Drive days. I destroy Charlie over two games, because that’s what Scottish dads do to build character. “What did you think, son?” I ask while dabbing. “Not as exciting as Pint Sized Soccer or whatever it was called,” he says. “Does it make you want to play ice hockey?” I say. “No Dad,” he sighs, “I don’t want early-onset dementia through repetitive blunt force head trauma. I like being able to read without moving my lips.” I can’t really disagree with that. “Also, the Scottish genes have cursed me with bad teeth, but they are better than no teeth at all.” Are they though? At times I have felt I would have been better off replacing mine with wood. We need something lighthearted, so I move on to Baseball Stars 2, a PlayStation 4 port of the 1992 Neo Geo classic. The graphics and tune give me the headiest whiff of nostalgia so far, transporting me back to my Notting Hill basement flat. I can almost smell the unwashed Sunday league socks and Drakkar Noir. Again, it’s not the same. Again, it’s the controllers at fault. The Neo Geo arcade joystick was huge and solid, like playing with a piece of the Berlin Wall. Today’s PS4 controller seems tiny, soft, and shrivelled in my hands. Charlie gets annoyed because I resort to the classic tactic of slow pitch then fast pitch, curve out, curve in. Steam pours from his ears. We stop midway through the second game when I am 10-2 ahead. Charlie’s verdict? “It just reinforces baseball as the dullest sport in the world, which Americans try to legitimise with pointless statistics.” We’re running out of games and time, so I play one of my ace cards: NBA Playgrounds, a modern take on NBA Jam. I know he’ll like it because it has somersaults, flames and people with enormous heads, and he loved circuses. It’s a win. We laugh throughout. Charlie actually beats me in the first game, so I make him play again. And again. And again. Until he forgets his solitary triumph and begs to move on. “Does that make you want to play basketball?” “Do I get to do somersaults with flames coming out of my butt?” “No.” “Forget it, then.” One more throw of the dice. As my editor wrote recently, golf is the one sporting video game that everyone loves to play, even if they don’t play golf in real life. The oldest PGA golf game I can find is 2015’s Rory McIlroy PGA Tour. I have played this before, so to give Charlie a chance he plays as 92-rated Rickie Fowler while I use the 80-rated Miguel Ángel Jiménez. I explain the intricacies of aiming, hooks, fades, wind, and green speeds, but Charlie interrupts by screaming “LeeroyJenkins!” and whacks the thing. Perfectly straight. Right down the fairway. I don’t know whether it’s a fluke or a miracle but this is his tactic. All game. And it works. It helps that his golfer is a young stud with immeasurable strength, while my guy has to get up three times a night to pee. Fowler can fart the ball further than Jiménez can drive it. Charlie destroys me with his putting and wins by seven strokes, but says the clothes and walking put him off the real thing. “But son, if you don’t like sport, you won’t survive among other adult men.” “Don’t worry Dad,” he says with a hand on my shoulder and a patronising grin, “I’ve learned everything I need to survive from Fortnite.”",Arts/Games,"I’m trying to educate my son in sports video games, but he is not having any of it | Dominik Diamond",https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/apr/27/im-trying-to-educate-my-son-in-sport-using-video-games-hes-having-none-of-it
4/27/2022,"Ben Foster has been out on a boat with scallopers. The actor is studying fishermen as immersive preparation for his next film. He speaks to the Guardian via Zoom from a dock in Massachusetts. But the feed is audio only. The thing about Zoom’s black screen is that the imagination tends to compensate and run riot. Is Foster sitting there drenched, clad in a sou’wester and wreathed in seaweed, king mackerel dangling from a hook? We will never know. Born in Boston, he took up acting as teenager and made his mark, often brooding and mercurial, in films such as Alpha Dog, 3:10 To Yuma, The Messenger, Leave No Trace and Hell or High Water. Now 41, he has gained a reputation for diving deep into every role – all the way to the ocean floor. In 2014 he took on Stanley Kowalski, famously played by method actor Marlon Brando on screen, opposite Gillian Anderson in A Streetcar Named Desire at London’s Young Vic. When the production crossed the Atlantic, the New York Times told how he had found inspiration for the character in apes. “He examined pictures of Francis Bacon’s baboons,” the paper reported. “He screened YouTube videos of silverbacks encountering mirrors in the jungle. ‘Watching how they live in their bodies was very important to me,’ he said.” When Foster portrayed a navy seal in the 2013 film Lone Survivor, leading cast members were put through a boot camp for a month. The Guardian reported that Foster was seen “scoffing handfuls of dirt”, prompting the headline: “Ben Foster: why I ate dirt for Lone Survivor.” That is not quite how he remembers it now. “It wasn’t handfuls and so lore goes and myth goes and people like to over talk it,” he said. “The truth of the story is that I looked at my fellow actors who had just fallen down a mountain and they were laughing in between a take and I became starkly aware of their Hollywood teeth. “I immediately became self-conscious. If you’ve just fallen down a mountain your teeth probably don’t look like that, so I just grabbed some dirt and put it in my mouth and the director caught me. It felt like you probably catch some in your mouth on the way down a mountain. It wasn’t that thoughtful, nor was it that impressive; it was actually unimpressive. “It was just, my God, these people are filthy and covered in blood and this is a real story and we’re surrounded by navy seals who are helping guide us, but they’ve got sparkling American fucking teeth and that felt somehow apprehensible. My instinct was just to grab some dirt and put it in my mouth. It’s not like I’m hosing down dirt just to prove a point!” With that he bursts out laughing. Foster is evidently reluctant to embrace the term method actor, whatever that means. “Well, it’s a funny word and it’s a term that’s often misinterpreted and I probably don’t have a great interpretation or definition of it.” He puts it another way. “Maybe this is a shitty thing to say and a cop out, but if you were to spend six months thinking about about making chairs – oh my God, I love wood, I love making chairs, the way the seat works – and you’re spending time with people who love chairs too and you just want to honour chairs, you’re going to think about chairs. “Then when the film ends and you’re no longer making chairs, you’re going to dream about chairs. That’s what it is. It’s not fancy. It’s like, well, this is what we’re talking about and they were there, I wasn’t, so let’s think about it a little bit more rather than, ‘Oh, let’s go have a yoghurt together. Anyone want a smoothie?’” Foster used this approach for the title role in The Survivor, directed by Oscar winner Barry Levinson, who cast him in his first film when he was 17. It is based on the true story of Harry Haft, a Polish Jew who, after being sent to Auschwitz, stayed alive by taking part in bare-knuckle boxing matches with fellow prisoners for the amusement of the Nazis. Haft later settled in America and had a brief career as a light heavyweight, even taking on the mighty Rocky Marciano. Lyrically shot, the movie snaps back and forth between concentration camp and boxing ring. When it premiered at the Toronto film festival last year, Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw described it as “almost a case of Schindler’s List meets Raging Bull”. It is also a love story – Haft is driven by the hope of reuniting with the woman he lost – and exploration of survivor’s guilt. After the war, Haft is seen facing recriminations from Jewish people for having done the Nazis’ bidding to save his own skin; he died in 2007. Did Foster, too, come to judge him? “I suppose my job in my trade as an actor is to defend my character and it’s not to make excuses and it’s not necessarily to unravel the knot of ethical ambiguity. James Cagney has a fine quote about the work we do, which is plant your feet and tell the truth, and the truth is not all that simple or convenient. “Which is rare, particularly as I’m sure you’ve experienced as an appreciator of cinema, as it seems to be in the last 15 years, people are less interested in the exploration of the human experience. They want to see the mighty action and the heroic failure and to my experience, at least in its limited view, it’s not clean, it’s not easily violable.” “What Harry went through, there’s no easy answer here. He survived and he did it for love, and he wanted to see his loved one, the girl he loved. It’s interesting, I listened to hours of Holocaust testimonies, and there was a through line. “Much of that through line was the hope of seeing someone that might be gone and the imagined hope that they might be reunited. I just want to see my son. I just want to see my wife. I hope that they’re there still, and the hope that they might was the thing that said, ‘I’m not going to lay down.’” As part of his preparation this time, Foster visited the camps at Auschwitz-Birkenau. Asked what effect that experience had on him, he pauses. “I’m trying to find the words, I can recall, rather than an understanding, a sensorial experience. “I needed to put my hands on the rails and listen. It sounded like the birds have still not returned. You see those piles of baby shoes, you see the piles of people’s belongings: their toothbrushes become these objects that defy thought.” Haft suffered terrible weight loss in the camps; Foster shed 62lb in a remarkable physical transformation for the role. What dietary changes did he make to achieve it? He replies laconically: “Less food.” Then he laughs. “When a human body is denied sustenance, where does will come from? It’s that candle, that little bit of light that we keep inside, whatever that is, in the hope of seeing a loved one or let me get to the next holiday or I’m doing it for my friend or my friend died so I have to live for them. “And then the consequences of surviving must come into play. It’s not clean. That’s what I appreciate so much about Barry. He not interested in the easy answers. He’s more interested in the behaviour and the curious idiosyncratic animal that the human animal is and celebrating it in all of its wounds.” Foster took a similarly all-in approach to the hard-hitting boxing scenes and did not use a stunt double. He had not played a fighter before but both his grandfather and father boxed so he was able to learn from the latter. “The sweet science, as it’s called. There are only four moves in boxing so it’s a chess match. “In the time that we’re representing the art form, Harry is not what you would call the most refined boxer, more of a survival brawler, and I took much joy. Even last night, I was going into a spiral, I returned to these 40s boxers. I haven’t been able to shake Harry.” Actors such as Jared Leto and Forest Whitaker have been known to remain in character even after the cameras stop rolling. Foster, however, does not kiss his two young children goodnight while pretending to someone else. “I’m not coming home and speaking to them as Harry. That would be lunacy. However, when at work, some people find it easy to turn off and turn on and I appreciate the strict distance and craft of those that can turn off and turn on and joke around. Nothing makes me happier than a laugh, but this particular film I’d be lying to say that it felt like I would be doing a disservice to the story I was telling if I wasn’t shoulders back and heads bowed.” The notion of chameleon-like actors being able to transform themselves into any character has recently been tested by debates over “authentic” representation. The recent casting of Helen Mirren, who is not Jewish, as the former Israeli prime minister Golda Meir provoked criticism. Did Foster – whose grandmother fled pogroms in Romania – feel it important that Haft be played by a Jewish actor? “This is very dangerous territory and I sense you’re poking,” he says. “What I’ll say is I feel so grateful that I was invited to explore this because it allowed me an opportunity to re-evaluate, investigate, ask questions and sense my own Romanian-Ukrainian roots on my father’s side. “But let us not be so boxed in. I’m also Irish and let’s look at the struggles and the troubles of the Irish and let’s not be so contained there. Let’s look at Afghanistan and say this is about being a human being. It’s not a boxing film; it’s not a Jewish film, it’s about people. It’s about being a human being who is dealing with trauma. “I suppose indirectly, not to duck your question but to duck your question, I’m glad for the job because it allowed a time in my life that’s been meaningful.and hopefully that time translates. But past that, I can’t speak to why people are cast for what they’re cast. Acting is representation and I’ll leave it at that.” Indeed, there is no monopoly on suffering. Foster has just finished working on Apple TV+’s Emancipation, a film about the horrors of slavery in America’s deep south. He explains: “It’s about escaping the camps that America created with the African American slave trade. The stark similarities that I learned, particularly after visiting Auschwitz. are staggering. We are students and, as students. it’s not uncommon to feel a burden of new information and it takes a moment to digest.” The cast of Emancipation is led by Will Smith who, if nominated for another best actor Academy Award, will not be able to attend the ceremony. Smith was banned from the Oscars for 10 years after slapping comedian Chris Rock at this year’s event. Asked for his reaction to the slap, Foster again chooses his words carefully after a long pause. “Do you that John Lennon song, ‘I’m just watching the wheels go round and round?’” he asks with a laugh. “That’s what I’m doing in Massachusetts outside a fishing port. It’s not that I don’t give a shit or have an opinion. “I’m tired. I’m tired. My comment doesn’t mean fuck all. I’m an actor and that’s not to say that actors don’t have a place in society; plumbers do too. The boiler in my family’s house wasn’t working for a week. We didn’t have hot water and my wife and I were talking about, whoa, what do we do? “Well, we heat up water, we have some fire, make a bath for the babies. That’s real stuff and whatever they dealt with, I wasn’t there. I can comment but I’m not going to add anything important to this dialogue, so I’d rather just say, ‘Hey, we’re still here. Ain’t that something?’” Perhaps inhabiting a character deeply means that leaving them behind feels like a little death. Earlier, Foster mentioned that he hadn’t been able to shake Harry Haft. Is he lingering longer than most? “It’s so awkward to talk about,” he admits. “Again to the chairs, right? Sometimes I find myself sitting in Harry and realise it’s time to stand back up and look at other things. But appreciate that I got to sit for a minute.” The Survivor premieres on HBO on 27 April with a UK date to be announced",Arts/Film,Ben Foster: ‘This is very dangerous territory and I sense you’re poking’,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/27/ben-foster-the-survivor-interview
