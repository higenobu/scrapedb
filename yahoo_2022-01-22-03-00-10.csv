1/22/2022,"A US man has been found dead at his home surrounded by dozens of snakes - many of them venomous. Neighbours alerted police after going to the house in the US state of Maryland and discovering him lying on the floor, apparently unconscious. When officers arrived, they found 124 venomous and non-venomous snakes including pythons, cobras and rattlesnakes. The largest was said to be a 14-foot Burmese python. Although they were in tanks, animal control experts were called in. The unnamed 49-year-old man was pronounced dead at the scene. The cause of death has not yet been determined, but police say there is no evidence of ""foul play"". A post-mortem examination will be held. The nearby Charles County Animal Control centre is coordinating rescue efforts to move and rehome the reptiles with help from experts from North Carolina and Virginia. A spokeswoman for the centre told the BBC: ""All of the snakes were placed with out-of-state organisations with the proper authority, permits and/or licenses."" She added that some of the animals would possibly be adopted privately by approved handlers.

1/22/2022,"A Black woman received a $2.9 million settlement after a botched Chicago police raid in 2019. Anjanette Young told CBS she would've been happier if the cops were fired and she ""didn't receive a dime."" Police targeting the wrong house handcuffed Young while she was naked. A Black woman who received a $2.9 million settlement over a botched Chicago police raid said she would've been happier if the cops involved were fired and she ""didn't receive a dime."" ""There's no amount of money that will right this wrong,"" Anjanette Young told CBS Mornings in an interview that aired on Friday. ""The money is not justice."" ""I would have been more satisfied if all 12 officers had got fired and I didn't receive a dime,"" she added, saying she told her attorney she originally wanted the officers fired. Body-cam footage of the February 2019 incident showed a dozen Chicago police officers storming into Young's home while she was changing after a work event. ""You got the wrong house,"" Young screamed at the officers as they handcuffed her while she was still naked. Cops later draped a blanket over Young, but didn't let her put clothes on for 10 minutes, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. While police said they had a valid search warrant for the home, the information they used was faulty and the man they were searching for didn't live there, the Sun-Times reported. The city of Chicago agreed to the $2.9 million settlement in December 2021. Last week, Chicago's Office of Inspector General released a report detailing the aftermath of the raid and the city's response, CBS Chicago reported. The review outlined how individuals across the Chicago Police Department, the Civilian Office of Police Accountability, and the mayor's office failed to address the wrongdoings in the raid, the report said. ""I lost a lot of my life that night,"" Young told CBS Mornings. ""I actually thought that if I had done anything different than what I was doing, I would have died that night.""

1/22/2022,"Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc/Getty Sen. Mitch McConnell          Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is explaining a remark made Wednesday in which he briefly compared ""African-American voters"" to ""Americans"" — and drew immediate criticism from congressional Democrats who argued he was separating out Black people from the rest of the country.  His office says he was referring to turnout rates among the electorate. But that didn't quell the outrage in some circles. ""This is 2022 and being American is not synonymous with looking or thinking like you,"" Virginia Rep. Donald McEachin said in a statement to McConnell on Thursday, part of a larger wave of backlash from Democratic lawmakers and social media users. ""Please take 19 seconds to watch this video to understand why we have to fight for voting rights for ALL Americans,"" California Rep. Judy Chu wrote on Twitter, sharing a viral clip of McConnell's comment.  The Kentucky lawmaker, 79, had been answering a question at a press conference about voting access and possible concerns from non-white voters.  Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger is suddenly the most prominent name in election integrity. .And his office announced they were cracking down on so-called ""line warming"" at polling places.He thinks voters shouldn't be offered food and drink while waiting to cast their ballot.In an Official Elections Bulletin, Raffensperger reminded officials to enforce the ""buffer zone outside of polling locations."".The bulletin applies to all giveaways, but Raffensperger's office specifically mentioned handing out food and drinks.As contentious as this election has been, it'll probably be up to the courts to see whether keeping voters fed is okay or not ""Well, the concern is misplaced, because if you look at the statistics, African-American voters are voting in just as high a percentage as Americans. [In] a recent survey, 94 percent of Americans thought it was easy to vote. This is not a problem,"" he said. ""Turnout is up. Biggest turnout since 1900. It's simply— they're being sold a bill of goods to support a Democratic effort to federalize elections. … This goes back 20 years, the excuses change from time to time."" McConnell also contended that Democratic states like New York have more election restrictions in place on voting than Republican states do.  RELATED: As Mnuchin and Pompeo Considered Booting Trump, McConnell Wanted to Block Him from Biden Inauguration The issue has been at the forefront of the Democratic majority's agenda in Washington, D.C., with many in the party and outside advocates arguing federal legislation is needed to ensure conservatives cannot impose undue restrictions at the ballot box — obstacles like who can use mail-in votes, what forms of identification are required and when polling places are open. Republicans, in turn, say such legislation would amount to federal intrusion on a local process and that the voting changes they have passed into law across the country are about ensuring election security — despite the lack of any evidence of widespread fraud. What's more, some GOP lawmakers claim, the laws they enact don't really affect turnout. The matter is temporarily moot: Senate Democrats failed to revise the filibuster rule this week in order to pass a voting reform bill with their bare majority after President Joe Biden publicly urged them to do so. ""Here's one thing every senator and every American should remember: History has never been kind to those who have sided with voter suppression over voters' rights. And it will be even less kind for those who side with election subversion,"" Biden said in a speech last week in Atlanta. Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg via Getty  Sen. Mitch McConnell          After McConnell's statement Wednesday — and the ensuing controversy — he provided a subsequent quote via a spokesman: ""I have consistently pointed to the record-high turnout for all voters in the 2020 election, including African-Americans,"" he said. His spokesman referred reporters to McConnell's history of discussing turnout and voting access legislation as well as Census Bureau data about Black voter turnout. For example, in four recent federal elections Black voters cast ballots at roughly the same rate as the overall American electorate, though a few percentage points less. Overall election enthusiasm was also record-breaking in 2020, though voters were aided by changes like widespread mail balloting amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, however, Republican legislatures have sought to undue this, saying it was an exception in a public health crisis.  Still, they insist, it will be easy to vote even after they ""pare back"" some of these methods that made it easier for people to vote. RELATED: Mitch McConnell Now Says He'd 'Absolutely' Support Trump in 2024 After Savaging Him for Capitol Attack ""There's very little tangible evidence of this whole voter-suppression nonsense that the Democrats are promoting,"" McConnell said in 2020. ""My prediction is African-American voters will turn out in as large a percentage as whites, if not more so, all across the country."" As The New York Times noted, however, Black turnout tracks less than white turnout: 4.8 points behind in 2016 and 7 points behind in 2020.  This kind of disparity, voting access advocates say, shows the cost of new restrictions that purportedly address fraud and security problems.  Last year, per the Times, 19 states passed restrictive legislation. ""It can't be that we are satisfied with disenfranchising 10 percent of the population because 60 percent of the population showed up,"" one advocate told the Times.",Politics/People,Mitch McConnell Addresses His Comment Comparing 'African-American Voters' to 'Americans',https://news.yahoo.com/mitch-mcconnell-addresses-comparing-african-152614669.html
