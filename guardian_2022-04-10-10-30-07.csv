4/10/2022,"The federal election has been called for 21 May, and the campaign has officially started. Here is everything you need to know about the voting process. The Australian Electoral Commission, the independent body that runs elections, says there are 17 million people enrolled to vote in the 2022 federal election – 96.3% of the eligible voting population. It estimates there are more than 650,000 eligible Australians who have not yet enrolled. Eligible Australians have one week after the election has been announced to enrol. You can do so on this page of the AEC website. If you were previously enrolled but have changed any personal details, such as your name or your address, you can update them here. If you are not sure of the status of your enrolment, you can check here. You can also call the AEC on 13 23 26. You can find your electorate by entering your address on this page on the AEC website. The results of the 2019 election in each electorate are on the commission’s Tally Room site, but bear in mind that boundaries of some seats in Victoria and Western Australia have changed since then. You can read about what those changes mean on the election blog of the ABC’s Antony Green. If you are unable to cast a ballot in person at a polling station on election day, there are several other ways to vote. At this election extra provision has been made to ensure those affected by the recent floods in Queensland and NSW, and people affected by Covid, are not disenfranchised. If you can’t make it on the day, you can vote in advance at a pre-polling station. A list of these will be published on the AEC website. Mobile polling facilities are also set up in some hospitals, nursing homes, prisons and remote areas in advance of polling day, although at this election that service will be limited by Covid considerations (see below). Once the election is called, you can apply via the AEC website to have your ballot papers sent to you in the mail. These must be completed by close of polling on election day and returned to the AEC, which allows 13 days after that for the ballots to arrive. In some countries you may be able to access an overseas voting centre – a list will be posted on the AEC website. Otherwise you should apply for a postal vote immediately, allowing enough time for the papers to be mailed to you. The AEC has expanded the provision of voting by phone (traditionally used for blind or low-vision Australians) to accommodate people who may be required to isolate because they have Covid or they are a close contact of someone who does. However, it has warned the process may not be entirely flawless. People who expect to be in isolation on polling day may apply for a postal vote. Those who test positive or who are close contacts of someone who tests positive between Wednesday and Saturday should contact the AEC to arrange a vote by phone. Close contacts who return a negative rapid test should check with their state or territory whether they are entitled to leave isolation to vote in person. At the ballot box, you will be handed two pieces of paper. The smaller is for the House of Representatives, which is elected using preferential voting. You must number every box in order of your preference for your vote to be valid. The larger is for the Senate, which consists of 76 members, 12 for each state, and two for each territory. On the Senate ballot paper, you can vote in one of two ways. First, you can number at least six boxes above the line, indicating the parties or groups you prefer in the order of your choice. Or you can vote below the line, meaning you are voting individually for the candidates nominated by each party or group. In this case you must number at least 12 boxes to cast a valid vote. There are 151 members of the House of Representatives, so one party needs to win at least 76 seats to form a majority government. Going into the election, the Liberal-National Coalition holds 76 seats, Labor holds 69 and the six others are held by minor parties and independents. To reach 76, Labor would need to retain their current number of seats and gain another seven. However, picking up an extra four seats from Liberal or Nationals would be enough for them to overtake the Coalition.

According to analysis by Green: “Labor needs a uniform swing of 3.1% to gain four seats and 3.3% to gain seven. Yet Labor is defending 13 seats on a margin of up to 3%.” If the Coalition loses even one seat, but Labor fails to gain seven, Australia would have a hung parliament. In that case one or other of the major parties would have to secure the support of enough minor party or independent MPs to form government. A new wave of independents is running in Coalition-held seats at this election, which may increase the chances of a hung parliament.",News/Australia news,Australian election 2022 voters’ guide: everything you need to know ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/10/australian-election-2022-voters-guide-everything-you-need-to-know
4/10/2022,"Australia’s federal election will be held on Saturday 21 May after Scott Morrison flew from Sydney to Canberra to visit the governor general, David Hurley, on Sunday. Before formally kickstarting the campaign, the prime minister released a video to social media, saying Australia was facing “a world that has never been more unstable since the time of the second world war”. “You always have setbacks. You always have imperfect information. I mean things are tough, and they’ve been really tough.” “There’s drought. There’s floods. There’s fire. There’s pandemic. There is now war.” He said 40,000 Australians were alive and 700,000 people still had jobs as a result of the government’s handling of the pandemic, saying “countless” businesses had also been saved. “This is why as we go into this next election – what’s firing me up? We’re actually in a really strong position,” he said. He recounted a recent visit to a trade school in Brisbane where half the class indicated they wanted to start their own business. “How good’s that? That’s why I love Australia.” Shortly after, Labor released its response to the video, including criticism of the government’s “decade of climate inaction”, and footage of Morrison repeatedly saying “that’s not my job”. “No more mistakes. No more excuses. No more Morrison,” it says. The Labor leader Anthony Albanese also released a new campaign video saying, “Australians deserve a prime minister who shows up, who takes responsibility and who works with people. “I’ll work with business to invest in manufacturing. Making more things here will create more secure jobs here,” he says. “I’ll help families get ahead by making childcare cheaper, reducing power bills and investing in fee-free Tafe, and I’ll make it easier to see the doctor.” “It’s my plan for a better future.” In an opinion piece published on Sunday, Morrison said the election provided “a clear choice, with real consequences for Australia.” “Our government is not perfect. But we have been upfront. You know what we stand for, you can see our record of delivery, and you can see our plan for the future,” he wrote. “Our economy has a lot of moving parts and a lot of risks. But also, many opportunities. “Anthony Albanese and Labor have no economic plan. They would weaken our economy and put our recovery at risk.” Since handing down the federal budget a fortnight ago, the prime minister has been attempting to campaign on the Coalition’s economic credentials, accusing Labor leader Anthony Albanese of trying to “slide” into office without scrutiny. However, the post-budget bounce Morrison had been relying on ahead of the May poll was derailed after the NSW Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells launched an extraordinary spray in the Senate about the prime minister’s character. He was also forced to fend off criticism from NSW Liberal Catherine Cusack, and the man he knocked off for preselection, Michael Towke, who accused Morrison of using race against him in a controversial preselection ballot in 2007. A High Court challenge against preselections in the NSW branch of the party was dismissed on Friday. Morrison has spent the past week campaigning in a swathe of marginal NSW seats, including Banks, McMahon, Parramatta, Shortland, Dobell and Robertson. He has also visited marginal seats in Tasmania and Victoria. Albanese meanwhile has visited marginal seats across NSW, Queensland, WA and South Australia. Labor holds a notional 69 seats in the 151 seat House of Representatives, so needs a net gain of four seats from the Coalition to hold more seats in the House, and a net seven seats to form majority government. The Coalition holds 75 seats, so also needs to win seats to have a majority. There are seven independent and minor party MPs, with most expected to retain their seats. Labor has been talking up its commitments to aged care unveiled in last week’s budget in reply speech, and has been campaigning on Morrison’s character. Speaking in Adelaide in the marginal seat of Boothby on Thursday, Albanese said the government was behaving like an opposition. “They’re running a negative campaign. They’re going to have a really difficult month over the next month, because Scott Morrison is running like an opposition leader. He’s stopped governing.” But Albanese, who has been running a small target strategy, rejected suggestions voters did not know who he was. “People know who I am. When I’ve travelled around, I was in WA for the last three days, I was in Queensland before then. People know who I am. People know that Labor has put forward a constructive alternative and will continue to do so.” Morrison has been framing the campaign as an “opportunity for scrutiny” of Albanese, saying he has gone untested by voters so far. “Anthony Albanese has been skating away there without a lot of scrutiny or a lot of attention, sort of pretty happy to try and get elected as quickly as he can and try and avoid the scrutiny of an election campaign,” Morrison said on Monday. “I stand before you all the time, and people will get certainly thrown plenty at me, but here I am standing strong, standing tall.” He said the election was not about how unpopular he was. “Elections are serious things as the Australian people know. They know it’s not a reality show, it’s not based on who they like or don’t like, they know it’s about the economy they will live in as a result of the decisions that are taken by their government.”A Guardian Australia analysis of seat visits by the two leaders shows that since Parliament rose in December last year, Morrison and Albanese have spent most of their time campaigning in NSW and Queensland. The Labor leader has spent most of his time on the road since December in Queensland after also taking a holiday there over the Christmas break. Albanese has said that Labor “need to do better in Queensland”, and that he believes voters in the state are ready for a change in government. “The feedback I have from Queenslanders is that they’re up for a change,” Albanese said in Brisbane on Monday. Morrison’s most frequently visited seats since Parliament rose in December last year include Reid and Macquarie in NSW, Lyons in Tasmania and Chisholm in Victoria. Albanese has most frequently visited the electorates of Reid and Dobell in NSW, Bass in Tasmania and Lilley in Brisbane. The latest Guardian Essential poll shows the Coalition is starting the campaign from behind, with Labor on 50%, the Coalition on 45%, and 5% of respondents undecided on the latest two-party preferred “plus” measure.",News/Australia news,Australian election 2022: Scott Morrison to call 21 May federal election,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/10/australian-election-2022-called-australian-prime-minister-scott-morrison-may-21
