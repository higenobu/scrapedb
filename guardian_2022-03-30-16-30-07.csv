3/30/2022,"In October 2019, six weeks after Bury were expelled from the Football League, a group of supporters met in the back room of a local pub. With Gigg Lane padlocked and the club spiralling towards liquidation, discussions began over forming a team to keep football in Bury alive. “The priority was getting players on the pitch playing again,” says Phil Young, one of the fans in attendance. Two and a half years on, Bury AFC have earned promotion in their first full season and Young is the chair of Shakers Community, the trust that underpins the new club’s fan-owned model. It has been an impressive start to a journey beset by twists and turns. “There have been a lot of different obstacles in our way,” Young says. “We’ve had to deal with a pandemic, which hasn’t helped.” Plans for Bury AFC’s inaugural season were disrupted by the Covid-19 outbreak of early 2020, and the virus’s resurgence the following winter saw the campaign abandoned with the team second in the North West Counties League, Division One North. As Bury AFC began again last summer, optimism was in short supply despite the big crowds drawn to Stainton Park, the club’s current home in Radcliffe. “There were players who really struggled with their mental health when we returned,” says the manager, Andy Welsh. “They had lost a bit of belief – I suppose the thing in the back of their minds is: ‘What if the season gets curtailed again?’ “We’ve all worked hard to get around the lads, pick them up when they need it, and leave no stone unturned in terms of support for them – on and off the field,” adds Welsh, whose playing career took in stints at Sunderland, Stockport and Yeovil. “That makes me proud more than anything – to see us all come together and win the league after a pre-season where some players were in a bad place.” Promotion to the NWCL’s top division was secured with a 4-0 win over St Helens Town on Sunday but Welsh does not expect much to change next term. “We will be the team to be shot at again,” he says of a side attracting four-figure crowds in the 10th tier. “Being a Mancunian myself, I know what the hard-working locals want to see on a Saturday. They want to go and watch their team work hard, and win.” This mindset helped Welsh stand out among 750 applicants for the Bury AFC manager’s job. “We wanted to build around Andy,” Young says. “He had a good track record, but he also represented the values we wanted to instil in the club. Our players have been loyal because they want to play for him, and for our fans.” It is this sense of community spirit that Bury AFC’s founders have fought to keep at the club’s core. “I don’t feel that we’re just trying to recover what we lost,” Young says. “This has been an opportunity to start with a blank sheet of paper, and try to decide what a football club should be. Our role is to be a true community club. The colours and crest show where we came from, but we’re not just trying to recreate Bury FC – clearly the old club had its problems.” In Bury, some supporters have disagreed over the right path to take – while many have followed the phoenix club, others kept their focus on reclaiming Gigg Lane. The story took another twist in February when a separate supporters’ group, Est. 1885, bought the ground from administrators – expressing a desire to “find a consensual path with Bury AFC” for football to return to Bury FC’s spiritual home. Young agrees that “one team for the town [is] the course we’re on” but explains the situation is not straightforward, with February’s developments coming “out of the blue”. Discussions are ongoing but any agreement must be voted on by the new club’s members. Young admits that tensions in 2019 may have created “a lack of trust between parties” but believes reports of a divided fanbase are an exaggeration. “This is nothing compared to other football clubs!” Welsh says: “I know a lot of our fans are Bury fans and they want to be back at Gigg Lane. That’s not something I, or anyone at Bury AFC, am in control of.” Young is adamant that although a return is preferred, it is not the only option. “We don’t want to just kick a ball there. We have to be sustainable as a football club – not just get back to Gigg Lane as quickly as possible.” The board and manager at Bury AFC have big ambitions. “There does need to be a sense of momentum,” Young says. “Success will keep everyone happy.” Welsh cites the example of AFC Wimbledon, another fan-led enterprise. “Look where they are now – for us, that’s a fantasy story. If everyone can come together, we can create fantastic memories here.” Sunday’s crowd of 1,885 – echoing the year Bury FC were founded – already have new memories to cherish, with the first trophy of a new era secured. “What we’ve achieved this year has been absolutely massive,” says Welsh. “My players are not on thousands of pounds a week. I’ve demanded a lot out of them, but they have really bought into it.” Young says: “The players and fans were all in the bar together afterwards, cheering and singing songs for hours,” before returning once more to the bigger picture. “We’re not just trying to resurrect Bury FC. The lessons we’ve learned can benefit the whole of football – not to let what happened to Bury to have been in vain.”",Sport/Football,‘So proud’: Bury AFC’s promotion marks first big step on a different path,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/30/so-proud-bury-afcs-promotion-marks-first-big-step-on-a-different-path
3/30/2022,"To the Syrians who have suffered its attacks, the Kremlin’s lies about Ukraine must sound horribly familiar. Insisting that the victims of bombings are “crisis actors”, spreading falsehoods about chemical weapons, justifying the mass murder of civilians by claiming that anyone who resists is a “Nazi” (in Ukraine) or a “head-chopper” (in Syria): its disinformation tactics have been tested and honed. This organised lying has more or less destroyed the US left, and severely damaged the European left. As the activist Terry Burke documented in 2019, effective leftwing opposition to Donald Trump collapsed amid furious internal disputes about Syria and Russian interference in US politics, triggered by prominent figures reciting Kremlin falsehoods. Some of them turned out to be paid by the Russian government. Such lies are also familiar to Ukrainians. During the Holodomor (the famine in the 1930s exacerbated by Joseph Stalin’s policies), in which between 3 and 5 million people are believed to have died, the Kremlin line was that the peasants had plenty of food but were hiding it. In some cases, they were deliberately starving themselves to death. I guess you could call it method crisis acting. The current Russian disinformation machine has been widely blamed for what we now see as an “epistemic crisis” – the collapse of a shared acceptance of the means by which truth is discerned. We should contest and expose the Kremlin’s lying. But to suggest that the public assault on truth is new, or peculiarly Russian, is also disinformation. For generations, in countries such as the UK there was no epistemic crisis – but this was not because we shared a commitment to truth. It was because we shared a commitment to outrageous lies. As I’ve mentioned the Holodomor, let’s take a look at another exacerbated famine: in Bengal in 1943-1944. About 3 million people died. As in Ukraine, natural and political events made people vulnerable to hunger. But here too, government policy transformed the crisis into a catastrophe. Research by the Indian economist Utsa Patnaik suggests the inflation that pushed food out of reach of the poor was deliberately engineered under a policy conceived by that hero of British liberalism, John Maynard Keynes. The colonial authorities used inflation, as Keynes remarked, to “reduce the consumption of the poor” in order to extract wealth to support the war effort. Until Patnaik’s research was published in 2018, we were unaware of the extent to which Bengal’s famine was constructed. Britain’s cover-up was more effective than Stalin’s. The famines engineered by the viceroy of India, Lord Lytton, in the 1870s are even less well-known, though, according to Mike Davis’s book Late Victorian Holocausts, they killed between 12 and 29 million people. Only when Caroline Elkins’s book, Britain’s Gulag, was published in 2005 did we discover that the UK had run a system of concentration camps and “enclosed villages” in Kenya in the 1950s into which almost the entire Kikuyu population was driven. Many thousands were tortured and murdered or died of hunger and disease. Almost all the documents recording these great crimes were systematically burned or dumped at sea in weighted crates by the British government, and replaced with fake files. The record of British colonial atrocities in Malaya, Yemen, Aden, Cyprus and the Chagos Islands was similarly purged. Just as the Kremlin requires a campaign of disinformation to justify its imperial aggression in Ukraine, the British empire also needed a system of comprehensive lies. Not only were our imperial crimes deleted from the record, but an entire ideology – racism – was constructed to justify the killing, looting and enslavement of other people. At the end of his excellent BBC podcast series about QAnon, The Coming Storm, Gabriel Gatehouse lamented the loss of a “common frame of reference” and a “shared sense of reality”. I agree with him about the danger of conspiracy theories, but we should remember that when we last possessed a common frame of reference and a shared sense of reality, they were built on lies. Almost everyone in Britain believed that the empire was a force for good, and that we had a holy duty – the “white man’s burden” – to either crush or “civilise” those races we labelled “inferior” and “savage”. Almost everyone believed the lies of national heroism, the lies of the crown, the lies of the church and the lies of the social order. But most of us have emerged from that era, haven’t we? We’re more sceptical, less trusting now. Most of us recognise nonsense when we see it. Really? So how do we account for the fact that almost everyone in public life subscribes to the same set of preposterous beliefs? Let’s set aside the wild conspiracy theories of the far right, even though they’re now starting to infect the mainstream right. Let’s focus on the “acceptable” range of political opinion. Nearly everyone who appears in the media, across almost the entire political spectrum, seems to accept that economic growth can and should continue indefinitely on a finite planet. Almost all believe that we should take action to protect life on Earth only when it is cost-effective. Even then, we should avoid compromising the profits of legacy industries. They appear to believe that something they call “the economy” takes priority over our life support systems. They further believe that the unhindered acquisition of enormous wealth by a few people is somehow acceptable. They believe that taxes sufficient to break the cycle of accumulation and redistribute extreme wealth are unthinkable. They believe that permitting a handful of offshore billionaires to own the media, set the political agenda and tell us where our best interests lie is fine. They believe that we should pledge unquestioning allegiance to a system we call capitalism even though they are unable to define it, let alone predict where it might be heading. No terror or torture is required to persuade people to fall into line with these crazy beliefs. Somehow our system of organised lying has created an entire class of politicians, officials, media commentators, cultural leaders, academics and intellectuals who nod along with them. Reading accounts of 20th-century terror, it sometimes seems to me that there was more dissent among intellectuals confronting totalitarian regimes than there is in our age of freedom and choice. We have a truth crisis all right. But it is much deeper and wider than we care to admit. Perhaps the biggest lie of all is that the crisis is confined to the Kremlin’s falsehoods and the far right’s conspiracy theories. On the contrary, it is systemic and almost universal.

3/30/2022,"If Grant Shapps hoped P&O Ferries would fold before his ultimatum this week and reinstate 800 sacked workers, a letter by return quickly disabused him. Such a move, P&O Ferries’ chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite said, would lead to the company collapsing, adding the transport secretary was “ignoring the situation’s fundamental and factual realities”. It would not be the first time a minister had done so, when it comes to the sea. While Shapps has now promised measures to tackle the actions of P&O Ferries, which dismissed all crew around the UK employed on its “British”, (but Jersey-issued) contracts, and enforce minimum wages, the government has long turned a blind eye to pay abuses. Back in 2014, the late Bob Crow, then RMT union leader, decried the “super-exploitation of foreign nationals in the British shipping industry… a massive scandal that the political elite want to keep quiet”. The union launched protests over Condor Ferries, which sails from Portsmouth and Poole to the Channel Islands crewed from agencies abroad, which it says pay as little £2.40 an hour. (Condor did not respond to requests for comment.) In 2017, inspections of multiple vessels from different operators working out of UK ports by the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF) confirmed that paying below minimum wage was widespread. In early 2021, when Irish Ferries announced plans to bring its low-cost crewing model to the Dover-Calais corridor, unions warned of a race to the bottom. Irish Ferries had been the forefathers of P&O axe-wielding, in 2005 sacking – albeit with consultation – hundreds of crew to replace them with foreign agency workers. Instead of acting, the RMT complained, the government “rolled out the red carpet”. (Irish Ferries did not respond to requests for comment.) Hebblethwaite was asked by Darren Jones, the chair of the Commons business committee, if he was a “shameless criminal”, but he has candidly answered many of the questions that ministers never really wanted to ask. The average pay of a seafarer on the Jersey contract was £36,000 a year, he told last week’s hearings; ripping that up for cheap agency crew, average hourly pay will now be about £5.50 an hour. Tackling minimum pay, the one unequivocal, clear promise of action by Shapps, has actually been welcomed by P&O Ferries to “level the playing field”. The RMT backs enforcement, but points out it is irrelevant to the immediate crisis: “We don’t want the P&O staff who were on far more than minimum wage to come back with a 60% pay cut,” a spokesperson says. Moreover, it is a curious hill for Shapps to now plant a flag: minimum wage legislation was extended in October 2020 to most seafarers working in UK waters, regardless of where a ship was registered. But ferries were not included. Tim Tyndall, employment partner at Keystone Law, says: “The framework of the law is already in place. But while this has been referred to as a ‘loophole’ in the legislation, it is not a loophole at all,” Tyndall says. “The exclusion of employees on ferry services was quite deliberate.” More critical to P&O’s cost savings than hourly pay are rest days. Until the 17 March cull, crew were paid full-time on a pattern seven days of consecutive 12-hour shifts, sleeping on board, followed by seven days off. Now, agency staff will be engaged for a fortnight at a time at far lower pay, with no income in between. As Hebblethwaite spelled out in a letter to Shapps: “Under this model, crews are paid for the actual time they work (plus holidays) rather than the previous model in which crews were granted full pay for working 24 weeks a year.” Ship operators argue that they are simply utilising the global labour market; few holidaymakers, enjoying how far their pound or dollar goes in eastern Europe or Asia, might be concerned about local wages. But ships bring that differential straight into UK ports. According to Department for Transport statistics, fewer than 15% of seafarers working for UK-based operators are British; outside the officer class, more than three-quarters are drawn from outside the UK or European economic area. While P&O Cruises’ latest advertising campaign attempts to distance itself from P&O Ferries, the Carnival-owned firm has paid hourly rates that even a Hebblethwaite could not dream of. In 2012, a Guardian investigation revealed that ships sailing out of Southampton were paying staff as little as 75p an hour basic wage. Asked whether those rates had been improved, a P&O Cruises spokesperson said: “The cruise industry at large employs seafarers of over 50 different nationalities. Our rates of pay are competitive, fair and equitable and are based on market conditions in the seafarers’ home country.” The minimum wage for skilled workers in Marahstrata state in India, home to the Mumbai agency offices that supplies many Carnival crew, is currently 470 rupees (£4.73) a day. How Shapps will step into these murky waters will be watched with interest. Around the UK meanwhile, P&O Ferries has set out its stall to become the latest gig economy employer. According to a muster list seen for the Pride of Kent, one of the four Dover-based vessels where a total of just under 600 jobs were axed, the crew is now almost entirely from eastern Europe, flown in for a fortnight’s cheap work and then sent back. A spokesperson for the Nautilus International union said: “What happens to all these people who have trained as seafarers in the UK? And what does it say about us as a country that we allow this to happen?”",News/Business, P&O Ferries is not the first in UK waters to hire low-cost workers,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/30/p-and-o-ferries-not-first-uk-waters-hire-low-cost-workers
3/30/2022,"Dyson has announced its first wearable product that builds the firm’s air purification expertise into a set of Bluetooth noise cancelling headphones aimed at city dwellers wanting to avoid polluted air. Quite unlike anything the company has made before, the Dyson Zone is sure to draw quizzical looks. It is a set of large, plush headphones with a plastic mask-type contraption that connects from ear-to-ear across the wearer’s mouth and looks like something out of a sci-fi movie. It delivers purified air to the mouth and nose while simultaneously tackling noise pollution through its active noise cancelling technology. Chief engineer Jake Dyson said: “Air pollution is a global problem – it affects us everywhere we go. In our homes, at school, at work and as we travel, whether on foot, on a bike or by public or private transport. The Dyson Zone purifies the air you breathe on the move. And unlike face masks, it delivers a plume of fresh air without touching your face.” The eyebrow-raising design has a motor, compressor fan and air purifying dual-layer filter in each ear cup. The air is drawn through the filters cleaning it of 99% of particles as small as 0.1 microns, including pollen, bacteria and dust, as well as gas pollutants such as sulphur or nitrogen dioxide. The filtered air is then pushed along the inside of a visor, which sits just in front of the mouth and nose without making contact with the skin, creating a pocket of clean air for the wearer to breathe. The headphones have sensors that detect how fast the wearer is moving, automatically adjusting the airflow between three intensity levels to ensure they deliver up to 5 litres of clean air a second, the equivalent breathing rate of a jog. An air quality sensor in the left ear cup monitors real-time pollution levels sending the data to an app on your phone and telling you when to replace the filters, which should last for about 12 months of use in Europe or less in more polluted environments. The visor has size-adjustable arms and is attached to the headphones via magnets that can be unclipped or unhinged so that it drops down to the wearer’s chin pausing the fans to allow them to speak to others. Dyson also has an additional mask attachment that sits between the visor and face, including a FFP2 filter, developed in response to the masking requirements of the Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile active noise cancellation technology, similar to that found in Bose, Sony and other headphones popular with commuters, uses microphones to monitor the sound of the outside world and the spinning compressors either side of the wearer’s head to remove it via anti-sound waves played into the ear cups. The headphones can be used without purification by detaching the visor too. The battery lasts up to 4.5 hours at the Zone’s lowest purification rate or 90 minutes at maximum, intended to only be used for short periods. They last up to 40 hours when used just as headphones, fast charge via USB-C to 60% in 20 minutes and can be used when charging if required. The Dyson Zone is due to go on sale in the Autumn for an as-yet unannounced premium price expected to be in the £500 to £1,000 range.",News/Technology,Dyson launches Zone air purifying Bluetooth headphones with visor,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/30/dyson-launches-zone-air-purifying-bluetooth-headphones-with-visor
3/30/2022,"A giant dead leatherback turtle has washed ashore on the NSW central coast, with authorities saying it could have been killed by pollution linked to the state’s heavy rain and severe flooding. The turtle washed up on Avoca beach on Wednesday morning, and is estimated to be a 30-year-old adult, measuring more than 1.8 metres long. Officials at Australian Seabird and Turtle Rescue believe the turtle was probably affected by the pollution produced by the flooding and intense rainfall across the east coast. Leatherback turtles, which are the largest of the marine turtles, usually mature at around 20 years old and can live to at least 40 to 50 years. The leatherback is considered an endangered species in NSW, with the species under high risk of extinction if threats to their survival aren’t addressed. The species can sometimes be spotted feeding and foraging in the coastal waters of NSW, which are considered part of its migratory corridor, although sightings are rare. Only 58 leatherback turtles have ever been seen in NSW. A spokesperson from the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service said there was as yet no confirmed reason for its death. “There are no obvious signs pointing to how the turtle may have died, but experts from the Australian Registry for Wildlife Health are taking samples for analysis,” they said. “The Australian Museum will also collect the skull to help better understand the leatherback population in Australia.” The body of the turtle was removed from the beach, and will be buried by authorities. The body of another leatherback washed ashore a little farther north at Birdie beach earlier in the week. Mark Hamann, an associate professor in marine biology at James Cook University, said the turtles face many challenges in the Pacific Ocean. “We’ve got a multitude of impacts in the whole ocean basin affecting the species, from pollution, to loss of eggs, loss of habitat, and fisheries bycatch.” “It’s pretty rare to see them. Across the entire east coast of Australia, you would only get a small number of leatherback turtles washing ashore each year,” he said. Hamann said the turtle was probably affected by the pollution dredged up by the flooding in northern NSW, due to their particular diet of jellyfish. “We know that one of the big problems that leatherback turtles have is the consumption of plastics. “So plastic bags that can smell a lot like jellyfish can get eaten by the leatherback. There’s a lot of plastic already in the environment, so these floods are really just adding to the issue.” Hamann said the turtle could have also potentially been killed in bycatch by fisheries. “We know that a small number of leatherback turtles are killed every year, accidentally in various bycatch by various fisheries in Australia and internationally.” ",News/Environment,Giant turtle found on NSW beach may have been killed by pollution linked to heavy rain,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/30/giant-turtle-found-on-nsw-beach-may-have-been-killed-by-pollution-linked-to-heavy-rain

3/30/2022,"Ali Smith revels in etymology. She loves wordplay and puns and homonyms and what Samuel Johnson – another great lexical player – disapprovingly called a “quibble”. I’m sure she knows that “current” means “running” (from the Latin currere). So the proclaimed purpose of her four previous books was always going to be problematic. Four novels, named for the seasons of the year, were written fast and published even faster in an attempt to close the gap between experience and a writer’s response to it. But the trouble with writing about current events is that they keep running on ahead of you. And running away from you. And running in directions you might not have foreseen. (Remember when Covid seemed like the world’s worst worry?) Besides, almost as soon as the series began, it became evident that Smith’s genius is too wayward to be contained within a programme, even a self-imposed one. Smith’s writing is discursive and protean. She writes stories that turn into spells and exchanges that morph from Platonic dialogues into music-hall patter. In the seasonal novels she writes about Rilke and Katherine Mansfield, about Pericles and joinery and the potency of cheap music. She approaches the topic of immigration by way of an excursion to a second world war internment camp on the Isle of Man, and a plot strand relating to a modern boy’s obsession with Albert Einstein, who once lived as a refugee in a hut on a heath in East Anglia. She cracks jokes, lots of them, some of rococo subtlety, some with the raucous rudeness of playground taunts. Her idiosyncratic, staccato fictions touch on modern preoccupations such as the climate crisis and migration and the pandemic, but they do so obliquely, through rainbow-creating prisms provided by history or by the author’s unusually acute sensitivity to craftsmanship and the beauty of material things – be that the curve of a curlew’s beak or the intricacy of the carving on a tombstone. So here comes the scheme-busting fifth part to the quartet. Told (mostly) in the first person by a single narrator, Companion Piece is structurally tighter and more contained than its predecessors. In Spring one of Smith’s lead characters was a film-maker who wanted to shape his film as a series of postcards. Snapshots, glimpses and fragments of time were to be juxtaposed, setting up a jangle of echoes and dissonances and suggestive harmonies. Smith’s whole book sequence has been, similarly, a collage of bits and pieces, of loose ends plaited together. In Summer the word “meander” comes up. Smith, characteristically, goes off on one (a linguistic meander, that is). The character speaking points out that “me-ander” could be an Anglo-German bastard word meaning me/other. In a piece of fiction that is full of parables of foreignness, the wordplay is ideologically resonant. It chimes with the moment when another character sees his file stamped “enemy alien”, as though the two words were synonymous. It is also a gift to anyone trying to grasp Smith’s narrative method. A meander is an apparently purposeless loop whereby a river turns around on itself. Beautiful, baffling but also efficient, it allows water to search out its best way, indirectly but ineluctably, towards the sea. Companion Piece flows straighter. There are only two narrative strands, and they do intersect, albeit supernaturally. The narrator of the dominant one is Sandy, AKA Sand, or Shifting Sand or Sands of Time (in Smithworld the quibbling never stops). Sand’s father is ill. She moves into his house and spends time with his dog. One night she receives a phone call from a woman she was at school with, Martina, who wants to tell her a story. The two women have never much liked each other. Their conversations are grouchy, but the stories they exchange are transformative. Soon Martina’s teenage twins have burst into Sand’s life as well, jabbering in acronymic text-speak, presumptuous and annoying and very funny. This is a lockdown story. People, Sand among them, sit outside the hospital gazing up at the windows of the ward where the people they love are probably dying. When Martina’s family invade her home, Sandy is outraged – not only because she treasures her solitude but because, as Covid-denying anti-maskers, they may be carrying disease. As always, though, Smith feels the deep undertow of history beneath the superficial eddies of the current. Sand walks the dog in a park beneath which lies a medieval plague pit. The supplementary storyline brings in another intruder, a time-travelling female blacksmith with a fairytale aura, who made beautiful things centuries ago. Those things include a famous lock, all wreathed around with wrought-iron ivy leaves, that is at the centre of the story Martina told. Sand is quite like Ali Smith. She has a way with words. She is gay. She is creative and cussed and seldom says what you expect her to say. But there’s not a shred in this book of the fashionable solipsism of autofiction: Smith is too receptive to the world’s variety for that. Lyrical visions alternate with end-of-pier farce and then with exasperated commentary from the narrator about the incongruity between the two. Shakespearean echoes sound through the book. Fables enrich it; fables about fathers and daughters, about interchangeable siblings, about magic beasts and sexual indeterminacy. There is a whole chapter on the origins and varying significances of the word “hello”, a banal little greeting that seems to say that aliens don’t have to be enemies. Companion Piece is shapely, but not conclusive. It doesn’t feel like a coda to the Four Seasons tetralogy, rather an addition to a book sequence for all seasons, with no end in sight. Smith could carry on adding to the writerly collage she is creating through many more volumes. I hope she does.  Companion Piece by Ali Smith is published by Penguin (£16.99).
