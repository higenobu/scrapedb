1/19/2022,"Things fall apart. It had been intended as the comeback day. The day when Big Dog finally stopped barricading himself in his Downing Street kennel and came out to prove there was life in the confidence trickster yet. That, by sheer force of personality and the odd gag, Boris Johnson could make the Tory party – and possibly even the country – fall back in love with him. And yet right from the start of his TV interview with Sky’s Beth Rigby at Finchley Memorial hospital in London, it was clear the prime minister was running on empty. All passion spent.  Things fall apart. This was Johnson as we’ve rarely seen him. Not contrite, exactly: he still doesn’t really seem to believe he’s the cause of his own fall from grace. But certainly Hang Dog rather than Big Dog. Someone who can tell the game is up. Someone who has run out of last chances and has no more lies to tell. None that will be believed, anyway. A beaten man no longer in control of his own destiny who is waiting on a miracle to save him. Things fall apart. Rigby went straight to the heart of the matter. Dominic Cummings says you are lying and that you were explicitly warned the party should not go ahead. This account has been confirmed by a second source. So, have you lied? she asked the prime minister. For once Johnson was wearing a mask inside a hospital, but even so there was no sign of the usual telltale smirk. His eyes were the giveaway, as they invariably are. Puffy, almost closed, the pupils bloodshot pinpricks. Eyes that had stared into his soul and been surprised and alarmed to find that he had one. Albeit a primordial work in progress. Things fall apart. “I’m sorry for my misjudgments,” he said, before hastily correcting himself to speak in the passive tense. He was sorry for the misjudgments that had been made. That was better. His safe place, where he was not responsible for his own actions. Nobody had told him he was doing anything against the rules. When he had gone out to join the party – not that it was a party – he had thought he was attending a work event. Things fall apart. This was either gaslighting of the highest order – after all, he had made the rules and told the country to obey them at frequent press conferences, so you would have thought he knew what they were – or we were witnessing the partial implosion of the Johnson psyche. Someone so detached from a painful reality he could no longer take any responsibility for himself and could only relate to himself in the third person. A separate entity. Things fall apart. What followed was a police interrogation as, slowly and forensically, Rigby destroyed every alibi. Was Johnson saying that Dom was a liar? Boris didn’t dare do that. All he could do was repeat his assertion that no one had told him that the social event had been against the rules. Presumably because no one really thought they needed to spell it out that plainly, as they imagined the reasons for not having a party were blindingly obvious. Things fall apart. Was Dominic Lawson a liar? He, too, had said he knew someone who had warned Johnson not to go ahead with the party. “Um, er,” said Big Dog. “All I can do is humbly apologise for what happened.” And repeat that no one told him it was a bad idea. Then no one had bothered to tell him to put on his shoes or wipe his bum that morning. Every time he said it, pulling nervously on his toddler haircut, he sounded a bit more feeble. A bit more pathetic. You could almost sense his grip on power growing looser by the minute. Things fall apart. Rigby picked up the pace. Should Sue Gray interview Cummings? Should Cummings give testimony under oath? Would he resign if he was found to have misled parliament? How ashamed was he at having to apologise to the Queen? What did he think of the ministerial code? Presumably not very much, given he hadn’t sacked Priti Patel when she was found to have broken it. Big Dog sighed sadly. How was it that everyone found it ludicrous that he could go into the garden, see trestle tables laden with food and booze and 40 people getting a bit pissed and imagine he was at a work seminar? Who hadn’t done that? Things fall apart. “Will you still be prime minister beyond the end of this year?” asked Rigby. Johnson stared into eternity. He thought of how Dominic Raab had admitted the party had actually been a party to Sky’s Kay Burley earlier that morning. And had then gone out of his way to distance himself from it by saying he definitely hadn’t been invited and wouldn’t have gone anyway. Thanks for nothing, Dom. Things fall apart. Big Dog thought of how junior defence minister James Heappey had been laughed out of the Commons by all parties during an urgent question on bringing in the navy to control migrants in the Channel. The halfwit had been stupid enough to confess he hadn’t a clue what the plan was. Operation Red Meat was dead on arrival. He thought of how that snake Rishi Sunak had yet again refused to offer him any support. Next year? He’d be lucky to make it through to the end of the week at this rate.

1/19/2022,"Most places you look in parliament, people are putting on a brave face. Devout-looking ministers and friends of Boris Johnson beam with confidence as they proclaim the prime minister is still safe, and his popularity will quickly rise when Covid restrictions are lifted and the Downing Street party scandal dies down.  Those Conservatives who are pushing for his removal say with equal certainty and a knowing grin that it’s “the end” and the number of no confidence letters is climbing speedily, with 54 required to trigger a vote. As one sped off down a corridor this week, they winked and proclaimed: “Karma’s a bitch, isn’t it?” After what was expected to be a difficult weekend for Tory MPs facing the wrath of their associations and constituents, some returned to Westminster reporting the mood music was “absolutely toxic” while others were surprisingly upbeat. The lack of another “killer blow” in the form of fresh party allegations or further evidence Johnson personally broke the law inspired some to hope the temperature was “settling”, a minister reflected. But the mood around parliament remains fraught amid rising tensions between backbenchers and the government. Tory MPs grapple with nervous colleagues asking whether they want to back or sack Johnson. Many are holding off on deciding whether to commit regicide until the parties report by civil servant Sue Gray surfaces. “It’s like waiting for Godot,” one complained. Some backbenchers admitted to having written their no confidence letter – but said they were waiting until Gray’s report is published before dispatching it. “If he misled parliament, it’s sudden death. That’s a red line,” said a former minister said, who backed Johnson in 2019, and in 2017 before his aborted first leadership bid. After Johnson on Tuesday delivered his first TV interview in days, where he stressed that no one warned him a “bring your own booze” event on 20 May 2020 with 30-40 staff was against the rules, MPs’ incredulity grew further. One, Pauline Latham, said: “We all knew what the rules were. And we all wanted to break them. There were people around this country that desperately wanted to break them because they want to see their loved ones. I just feel that we’ve got to get the truth here.” Even the alleged plan hatched by senior government figures dubbed “Operation Red Meat” has fallen flat. Tackling the promise to crack down on small boats arriving from across the English channel by putting the military in charge – to which navy sources responded by saying they would not pursue Priti Patel’s pushback policy – Tory MPs complained ministers were “yet again, giving it all talk and no action”. One said: “Wwe’re just drawing attention to an issue we are patently unable to solve – it’s daft politics and it’s desperate.” While many MPs still believe Johnson can rescue the situation, the group No 10 will be watching with most nervousness is the 2019 intake of Tories. Many feel they owe their seats directly to Johnson and have previously been loyal to him. So a gathering of two dozen of their number on Tuesday, in a colleague’s office in parliament, to discuss the partygate “shitshow” and no confidence letters will send jitters through the heart of Downing Street. “The wheels are in motion,” smiled one of those trying to engineer Johnson’s removal. In a sign of the distrust between backbenchers and ministers, there was “genuine concern” from one MP present that Tory whips had stationed someone outside the office where the 2019ers’ meeting took place, to count attenders in and out. The MP also feared a covert audio recording had been made of the meeting, which was quickly dubbed the “pork pie plot”. A government source pointed out the meeting was held in a place where MPs often walk through, though denied anyone was specifically posted outside to spy, and strongly denied knowledge of any recording. Given the “toxicity” of the situation – one of the most common words used by Tory MPs – muttered gossip between MPs is increasingly focused not on whether a vote of no confidence will be triggered but whether Johnson would survive it – and the potential leadership hopefuls who would replace him. Some of those who have not yet put in a letter privately said they would vote against Johnson in such a scenario. And even if he won the ballot, MPs supportive of Johnson suggested it would not make him immune from removal for 12 more months. “Just look at what happened to Theresa May,” a senior Tory quipped, referencing when the former prime minister won the 1922 Committee-triggered ballot on her premiership in December 2018 before announcing she would quit No 10 five months later. Tory MPs will have to keep their brave faces on as they prepare to endure another prime minister’s questions on Wednesday where Johnson has to field questions about No 10 parties. “I’ve never been more glad to need to wear a mask in the chamber,” one frontbencher sighed.",News/Politics,Westminster mood increasingly toxic as Tories mull next steps ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/18/westminster-mood-increasingly-toxic-as-tories-mull-next-steps
1/19/2022,"The mood of Conservative MPs was hardening against Boris Johnson on Tuesday night, with open talk of how to oust the prime minister and who should succeed him as he gave a disastrous interview claiming not to have lied over Downing Street parties. A string of Tory MPs from various ranks and wings of the party said they believed there would be enough letters to trigger a leadership contest after the publication of the Sue Gray report into allegations of lockdown breaches.  With MPs plotting his demise, Johnson emerged from isolation in No 10 to defend himself against claims from his former aide, Dominic Cummings, that he lied to parliament about believing a garden party in the first lockdown was a work event. The prime minister insisted “no one warned” him that that the 20 May 2020 “bring your own booze” party he attended alongside 30-40 staff was against the rules, and confirmed he had given his account of events to Gray. “I can’t believe we would have gone ahead with an event that people said was against the rules … nobody warned me it was against the rules, I am categorical about that – I would have remembered that,” he told Sky News. But Cummings claimed two officials warned the prime minister against holding a party. It is understood the former aide will also be interviewed by the Gray inquiry, which is expected to report in the coming week. In his interview, Johnson refused several times to rule out resigning and some Tory MPs believe he could agree to step down rather than go through a confidence ballot of the parliamentary party, if 54 MPs submit letters against him. Tory MPs said colleagues increasingly believed Johnson was more likely than not to face a confidence ballot, probably after the Gray report is published. A frontbencher said: “The mood has turned dramatically. He’s in real trouble. And it’s not just the 2019ers panicking about their seats. It’s quieter older colleagues. Unless the report says something staggeringly good, we will have a challenge.” Another Tory MP said: “It’s terminal. It’s turned from red hot anger to [a] cold, calculating sense of ‘How do we do this? And who are we supporting?’ … It’s a question of when, not whether. “Letters are coming from the left and from the right, from Brexiters and remainers, because what is slowly dawning on people is that there’s not about a policy issue, this is a mindset, a modus operandi and culture that needs changing.” Christian Wakeford, a 2019 intake MP, became the seventh Tory to reveal he had submitted a no confidence letter on Tuesday. While Tory MPs said other letters were being prepared and saved as draft emails, some rebels urged colleagues not to submit them to the 1922 Committee before Gray’s report because Johnson could win a vote held too early. One Tory MP insisted Johnson “will not win a vote of no confidence as there is no incentive to support him”. “With Theresa [May], she had those who were frightened of what could come next. He does not have that,” they said, adding: “It’s a disaster if it’s triggered before the report comes out, it will be held immediately and then people will not want to be judge before the evidence is finalised.” As a febrile mood gripped Westminster, a group of 2019ers gathered in the office of Alicia Kearns, a Tory MP, to discuss the prime minister’s future, although they denied it amounted to a plot. It was dubbed by Johnson’s allies as the “pork pie putsch”, as Kearns is MP for Melton and Rutland. Tories said parliament was full of talk about potential leadership campaigns, including by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who is believed to have the sharpest operation, and Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, who is currently in Australia. Other names being discussed included Sajid Javid, Nadhim Zahawi and Penny Mordaunt, while there are also possible candidates from the lockdown-sceptic right, such as Mark Harper, Steve Baker and Esther McVey. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary and former rival to Johnson for the leadership, gave an interview to PoliticsHome saying his “ambition hasn’t completely vanished” although claiming “it would take a lot to persuade me to put my hat into the ring”. Sunak gave only qualified support for the prime minister, saying he believed his explanation of events. But asked if the prime minister should resign if he lied to parliament, Sunak said: “I am not going to get into hypotheticals, the ministerial code is clear on these matters.” He then walked out of the interview as he was being asked whether Johnson had his unequivocal support. The backlash against Johnson has been driven partly by the public anger that Tory MPs heard in their constituencies at the weekend. One said activists were refusing to deliver leaflets for the forthcoming local elections because they are so demotivated. Many MPs also hinted in letters to their constituents that the prime minister may not be able to survive his in job. Sir Charles Walker, former vice-chair of the 1922 Committee, wrote to a constituent saying: “The prime minister and the party are severely damaged in the eyes of the electorate. It remains to be seen if this situation is recoverable.” He told the Guardian: “You have 20 months of lockdown, which has left a traumatised, anxious and grief-stricken country. All of three of those things are now focused on No 10 and it was inevitable: the consequences of lockdown.” MPs said they still do not believe Johnson has enough awareness of how much danger he is in. One said allies of the prime minister including Conor Burns and James Duddridge asked the Johnson at the weekend if they could help with a whipping operation on his behalf, to try to shore up support with MPs. “He didn’t take it seriously until that moment,” one MP said. “There has been no charm offensive on his behalf. The whips have done nothing.”",News/Politics,Tory MPs openly discuss Johnson challenge as mood ‘turns dramatically’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/18/boris-johnson-challenge-leadership-tory-mps
1/19/2022,"Good morning. The Australian Open is in full swing with the focus finally on the court following Novak Djokovic’s deportation. The Omicron outbreak continues to add pressure to struggling sectors as Australians fight to access tests and booster shots. Paramedics across Sydney who are already “drunk on fatigue” are being asked to drive ambulances home and to be on call as demand soars due to the Omicron outbreak. Chris Kastelan, the New South Wales president of the Australian Paramedics Association, suggested it was unprecedented for paramedics to be on call in Sydney and warned that the conditions were becoming unsafe. “I would suggest that the fact that that’s happening shows that the rostering or the staffing levels for both metropolitan Sydney and regional NSW is just not enough for the workload at this point in time,” he said. Last week, NSW Ambulance averaged 4,500 triple zero callouts per day. Prior to the Omicron outbreak, there had never been more than 4,000 calls on a single day. Tuesday was Australia’s deadliest day of the pandemic so far, with 77 deaths across the country.  Tonga is facing an “unprecedented disaster” from the massive volcanic eruption that covered the nation in ash and 15-metre tsunami waves that destroyed almost all the homes on two small islands, the government has said. Leaked images from the New Zealand defence force show some areas have had “catastrophic” devastation while others were relatively unscathed. Three people have been confirmed dead, but authorities fear the death toll could rise as the government has still not managed to make contact with several inhabited islands. Nobody was quite sure how Nick Kyrgios would perform at the Australian Open after missing all the warm-up events due to asthma problems and a bout of Covid. But he bested British qualifier Liam Broady 6-4, 6-4, 6-3 in one hour and 54 minutes. The game featured many of the theatrics that Kyrgios is known for, but, after the match, his actual words were of surprise. “The first couple of days [with Covid] I was bedridden, I didn’t know if I’d be able to play,” he said. “I’m just super happy to be here again.” In other games, Andy Murray beat No 21 seed Nikoloz Basilashvili 6-1, 3-6, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-4 and Emma Raducanu defeated Sloane Stephens 6-0, 2-6, 6-1. Facebook ads were used to push unapproved rapid Covid test kits to Australians and users are attempting to sell large volumes of rapid tests on Facebook marketplace, charging up to $300 for 20-packs, contrary to the site’s rules. A NSW GP who allowed an elderly patient to pay for his child’s school fees, buy him expensive medical equipment and build a granny flat on his property for her care has had his registration cancelled. A disabled man has been told he will have to wait “another month or two” to get Covid booster after an Australian vaccine contractor that provides home services prioritised aged care clients. A “clash of two crises” is looming when students return to NSW schools, as the Omicron wave adds pressure to a system that already faced severe and prolonged staffing shortages. A woman who may have seen Prince Andrew with Virginia Giuffre at a London nightclub 20 years ago is “willing” to provide testimony in Giuffre’s civil lawsuit against the royal, the witness’s lawyer said. The Israeli police allegedly conducted warrantless phone intercepts of Israeli citizens using the NSO group’s controversial Pegasus spyware, according to an investigation local media. Norwegian far-right mass murderer Anders Breivik has appeared in court asking to be released on parole after serving 10 years in prison for killing 77 people in 2011. Comedian Nazeem Hussain shares his love of massage guns, and a sad childhood story of loss in this week’s interview about beloved objects. “I’d save my massage gun [from a house fire]. I bought it on a whim in 2020 from an ad on either Facebook or Instagram. There’s usually a huge endorphin rush with purchasing things online and it’s all downhill from there – when it arrives, it’s meant to underwhelm you. But this was the opposite – the massage gun has made every night happier. I know that sounds wrong – I don’t mean it that way! Please don’t make this sound sexual!” Rebecca Sharrock is one of a handful of people worldwide with highly superior autobiographical memory. But remembering minute details of your own life has its downsides. “I need to have distractions such as noise and light around me to get to sleep,” Sharrock says. “If everything’s quiet, memories just flash into my mind and that keeps me awake … It’s awful to be a medical exception because very few people understand what you’re going through and there just aren’t many treatments designed for it.” Covid positive? More than a million people are currently infected with Covid across Australia.

1/19/2022,"A French skier who killed a five-year-old British girl after slamming into her at a resort in the Alps has been charged with manslaughter.Prosecutors in the nearby town of Bonneville said the accident had been caused by the experienced skier’s excessive speed, and charged a 40-year-old local man with manslaughter late on Monday after an inquiry was launched that morning.The incident took place as the girl was learning to ski late on Saturday morning in Flaine, northwest of Chamonix.The public prosecutor told local newspaper Le Dauphiné: “This is a man totally unknown to judicial authorities, who is clearly also devastated by the accident.”An autopsy also took place on Monday morning establish the exact cause of death. Local TV network France 3 Regions said initial reports suggested “a very violent shock”, and that the results would be passed on to the judge. The skier risks up to three years in imprisonment and a €45,000 fine, France 3 Regions said. The badly wounded girl died onboard a helicopter that was rushing her to hospital despite attempt at resuscitation after she was plunged into immediate cardiopulmonary arrest. She had been taking part in a lesson organised by the French Ski School (ESF) with four other children.The public prosecutor for Bonneville told France Bleu that the child was in single file behind the group and was about to make a right turn when she was “very violently” hit by a skier arriving at high speed who tried unsuccessfully to avoid her.  The accident was said to have taken place at the edge of the piste during clear weather.The girl had been on a skiing holiday with her parents who live in Geneva and own a holiday home in nearby Carroz, Le Dauphiné reported. The man, a volunteer firefighter, tried to give first aid to the girl immediately after the accident with the assistance of a local doctor, the paper said. The ski instructor, who was questioned as a witness, was not found to be at fault in any way, Le Dauphiné said.Jean-Paul Constant, the mayor of local municipality Arâches, said: “Everyone was very shocked.” He said staff at the resort and in the ski school would be provided with counselling and he was also looking for a psychologist who speaks English to assist the girl’s family, who have returned to Geneva.",News/UK news,French skier charged with manslaughter of five-year-old British girl in collision,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/18/french-skier-charged-with-manslaughter-of-five-year-old-british-girl-in-collision
