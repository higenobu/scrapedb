1/27/2022,"An Instacart driver is sparking all kinds of outrage online after sharing an alleged scam tactic he experienced. The story, which a TikToker named Nick (@niicky_diicky) shared in a now-viral video, has turned into a sort of PSA on ways scammers can take advantage of delivery workers.  It’s just the latest wide-reaching clip to show viewers some of the biggest pain points related to driving for a delivery app. In one recent video, an Uber Eats worker showed how customers can use “tip baiting” to trick their drivers into working faster. In another, a DoorDash driver explained the secret issue with delivering to apartment buildings. Nick’s storytime video details an incredibly frustrating experience that left his Instacart account frozen and stalled his ability to work and earn money.  As Nick explains in the clip, it all started when he got a simple delivery request for just two items. After he reached the store, the customer messaged him to say they might need to cancel their order due to an emergency.  Nick messaged them back, but they never confirmed that they needed to cancel the order. So, he went on with his delivery — purchasing the items and heading back to his car. Once there, the customer told him they needed to cancel the order but said that if Nick sent them his phone number, they’d Venmo him a tip for his wasted time.  “I didn’t think anything about that was weird,” Nick added.

A few minutes later, a person claiming to work for Instacart called him and said his customer was disputing the canceled order. According to the voice on the phone, Nick’s customer claimed that they never canceled their order and accused him of stealing their food. Confused, Nick explained what had actually happened. The voice on the phone then told him to provide his phone number and a one-time passcode to log into his account so they could resolve the issue. Hoping to get back to deliveries ASAP, Nick gave the info.   But as it turned out, the alleged Instacart worker on the phone and the “customer” who’d canceled their order were the same person. As Nick explained, it was all an elaborate scam to gain access to his Instacart login.  Immediately, the scammer tried cashing out Nick’s Instacart account, where he’d kept countless deliveries worth of pay. Thankfully, they didn’t manage to get the money — although the incident caused Nick’s account to be frozen, preventing him from making deliveries. The harrowing story infuriated many TikTok users, some of whom said they’d heard of the scam before. “Apparently, this is the new scam; this is the second time I’ve heard this happening,” one user wrote. “People will literally do anything for money,” another added. “These scams are getting out of hand. That’s such an elaborate scheme,” another agreed.  Watch this Brooklyn bedroom go from drab to fabulous in one day More from In The Know: Can you really deep-fry a fast-food burger? 7 flirty tops perfect for a first date Heading back to the office?

1/27/2022,"President Biden treated himself to a bit of retail therapy on Tuesday afternoon and stopped by Washington, D.C. small business HoneyMade, ""a store located in Barracks Row that sells handcrafted or locally made goods,"" reports DCist. Of course, what the president purchased is of just as much, if not more, intrigue than the visit itself. Per DCist, Biden purchased a hoodie for his grandson, a card for his wife Jill, and a Vice President Kamala Harris-themed mug that's reportedly already sold out online. Shopowner Viboonrattana Honey's daughter is also apparently a fan of the president's, so Biden wrote her a note and gave Honey a coin with the presidential seal to deliver as a gift. ""For him to come here, it means a lot for the small business owners because it's hard for us,"" Honey said of the visit, per DCist. Well, if all it takes is the president buying a mug designed after his right-hand woman, we're sure it's the least he could do. Senate candidate J.D.

1/27/2022,"A high school basketballer’s mom has demanded action after a student in the stands was recorded hurling racist comments at her son during a recent game. Sabrina Little-Brown shared the video on Instagram on Tuesday, describing how her son, Makai, was taken aback after he heard the comments while rewatching footage from a Friday night game “as he always does,” on Saturday morning before practice. In the video, a person can be heard saying, “Where is his slave owner?,” “Who let him out of his chains?,” “Chain him up,” and “He’s a monkey” as her son shoots free-throws. “He came into my room STUNNED,” Little-Brown wrote of her son who plays for Portola High School. “What he heard directed 100% to him is contained in this video, but these disgusting, racist insults continued throughout the entire game footage. Needless to say, our family is up in arms.” When reached by The Daily Beast on Wednesday, Laguna Hills High School athletic director Scott Wilford said administrators “have been investigating it all weekend and are still working on it.” Saddleback Valley Unified School District Superintendent Dr. Crystal Turner confirmed in a statement to parents, obtained by The Daily Beast, that the incident occurred at Laguna Hills High School during the Friday night game against Portola High, which is part of another local school district. According to Turner, school officials determined that the “inappropriate and inflammatory racist comments” came from a Laguna Hills student after reviewing game footage and interviewing spectators. “The language and connotations expressed by the words used do not represent the culture, attitudes, or feelings of the students and staff of LHHS, nor those of Saddleback Valley Unified School District,” she wrote, adding that the school is “taking action.” “The student has been counseled, and immediate, appropriate consequences and discipline have taken place,” she wrote. “Although apologies are necessary, they do not suffice. The words used by this student will never be acceptable.” Turner said that administrators also attended practice to talk about the seriousness of what happened with players and coaches. “Appropriate personnel actions, while required to remain confidential, have taken place,” she added. Little-Brown didn’t immediately respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment on Wednesday but in her post she alluded to broader challenges, saying she believed Laguna Hills Boys Basketball “fosters a culture of aggression, unsportsmanlike conduct and RACISM!” She also claimed Laguna Hills head coach David Yates had subjected her son to “verbal abuse” and “aggressive behavior,” and that her husband confronted him about it. “As a result of this verbal abuse my normally calm and level headed husband yelled at the coach to tell him not to address our son,” she wrote. According to Little-Brown, an assistant coach responded, telling her husband to “meet him outside in the parking lot after the game.” Her husband was escorted out of the game after responding to the assistant coach’s comments, she said. Yates joined Laguna Hills High School as head boys varsity coach after the 2017 season, according to a biography for coaching staff posted on the Laguna Hills website. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Daily Beast but he told the Orange County Register that Little-Brown’s retelling of the encounter was inaccurate. “There is much more regarding the entire incident that I am not permitted to share,” he said. Wilford declined to comment on details from the incident that involved Yates, noting that he wasn’t at the game. Parents Fume Over Handling of Vile ‘White Power’ Video With School Board Prez’s Kid Meanwhile, Makai’s dad Terrell Brown told KABC that what happened to his son seemed to reflect more broadly on Laguna Hills High School. “It’s deeper than just what that child was saying,” he told the outlet. “Their culture just seems to be broken to where it’s just not an environment that feels safe, at least safe for us.” His wife and other Portola High School parents addressed their concerns to city leaders during an Irvine City Council meeting on Tuesday night, KABC reported. “This isn’t the end. This is just the beginning of the work that’s ahead of us and for Laguna Hills High School, of the city of Laguna Hills, Saddleback Unified, fix yourself,” Irvine Mayor Farrah N. Kahn reportedly said at the meeting. Addressing the racist comments directed at Little-Brown’s son, Yates told the Register: “Of course they’re disgusting. They don’t represent the school, the district or our basketball program.” Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox. Sign up now.
