12/31/2021,"If you’re still bullish on the U.S. stock market, you may not want to hear what Bank of America has to say. The second-largest bank in the U.S. has a forecast of 4,600 for the S&P 500 by the end of 2022. With the benchmark currently hovering around 4,790, that means the bank is pointing to negative returns for the coming year. “The probability of a 10% correction in the near term or over the next 12 months is elevated,” the bank’s U.S. stock and quantitative strategy chief Savita Subramanian told Bloomberg earlier this month. At the same time, the Wall Street firm also highlighted three sectors that could outperform in the new year. And if those don’t appeal, the bank’s investment chief has pointed to one unorthodox asset that could outperform over the next decade. Let’s start with energy stocks, which have already done well in 2021. That shouldn’t come as a surprise, with inflation soaring and oil prices making a strong comeback. “Energy and financials offer inflation-protected yield,” Bank of America writes in a note to investors. Looking at the big names, we see Chevron shares are up 38% year to date, Exxon Mobil returned 48%, while ConocoPhillips enjoyed a stellar 81% rally. To put things in perspective, the S&P 500 returned just under 28% during the same period. In Q3, all three companies delivered substantial year-over-year growth in both revenue and earnings. These supermajors also provide oversized dividends compared to the rest of the market: ConocoPhillips pays 2.6%, Chevron offers 4.6%, while Exxon Mobil is yielding a juicy 5.8% at the current share price. Of course, it’s risky to go deep on a sector as volatile as energy. If you prefer a more stable approach, you can always build a diversified fixed-income portfolio just by using your spare change. While many market participants fear rising interest rates, plenty of financial stocks — especially banks — look forward to them. Banks lend money out at higher rates than they borrow at, pocketing the difference. As interest rates increase, the spread earned by banks widens. The sector is enjoying strong earnings growth this year. Quite a few banks also raised their dividends in 2021, which is great for investors who want to earn a passive income. For instance, Goldman Sachs boosted its quarterly payout by 60% to $2 per share. Morgan Stanley doubled its quarterly dividend to 70 cents per share. Meanwhile, Bank of America itself has increased its quarterly rate by 17% to 21 cents per share. Those three banks are all up at least 40% year to date — and that means they are not cheap. For instance, Goldman Sachs currently trades at $385 per share. That said, you can always get a smaller piece of the bank using a popular app that allows you to buy fractions of shares with as much money as you are willing to spend. You don’t need to look very far to find names worth considering in the sector — Bank of America has “buy” ratings on several health care companies. “Healthcare offers growth/yield at a reasonable price,” the bank writes. Earlier this month, the bank raised its price target on health insurer Centene from $85 to $93. Considering that the stock trades at $85.28 today, the new price target suggests a potential upside of 9.4%. Days later, Bank of America raised its price target on pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly to $300. That’s 9.2% above where the stock is at right now. Eli Lilly announced a 15% increase to its quarterly dividend to 98 cents per share earlier this month, giving the stock a forward annual yield of 1.4%. If you don’t want to pick individual winners and losers, there are also ETFs — such as the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund — that provide investors easy access to the sector. Remember, even stocks in different sectors can move in lockstep with each other in times of volatility. During a market-wide downturn, everything can get sold off. If you want to invest in something with big potential that also has little correlation with the ups and downs of the stock market, you might want to consider an overlooked asset: fine art. Contemporary artwork has outperformed the S&P 500 by a commanding 174% over the past 25 years, according to the Citi Global Art Market chart. And it’s becoming a popular way to diversify because it’s a real physical asset with little correlation to the stock market. On a scale of -1 to +1, with 0 representing no link at all, Citi found the correlation between contemporary art and the S&P 500 was just 0.12. Earlier this year, Bank of America investment chief Michael Hartnett singled out artwork as a sharp way to outperform over the next decade — largely due to the asset’s track record as an inflation hedge. Investing in art by the likes of Banksy and Andy Warhol used to be an option only for the ultrarich. But with a new investing platform, you can invest in iconic artworks, too, just like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates do. This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

12/31/2021,"Cathie Wood, superstar stock picker and CEO of investment firm ARK Invest, believes the stock market is in a bull run that will continue putting smiles on the faces of investors — so long as the U.S. can avoid a recession. Despite the sky-will-fall predictions of investors like Michael Burry, Wood recently told Barron’s that the market is “probably going to be fine,” explaining that value stocks, cyclical stocks and defensive stocks all continue to climb despite what COVID-19 and a disrupted economy have been able to throw at it. Inflation, she said, will “unwind pretty quickly.” Despite recent turbulence, Wood’s most well-known ETF, ARK Innovation, is up roughly 118% over the last three years. Let’s look at three companies the fund holds significant positions in that should benefit nicely from a continued bull run. You might even be able to get a piece of them with some of your extra cash. Wood believes Canadian e-commerce giant Shopify is in a position to challenge the space’s biggest player, Amazon, in the coming years. Thanks to its differentiated service and first-mover advantage, Shopify’s upside remains attractive according to Wood. “We're trying to figure out how Amazon is going to deal with this notion of individuals seeing something on Instagram or elsewhere on Facebook or on Twitter, or on Snap and just buying there,"" Wood recently told BNN Bloomberg. ""That's a Shopify-enabled commerce opportunity and we think it's going to be big."" Shopify is already pretty big. In Q3, the company raked in over $1.1 billion in revenue and currently boasts a market cap greater than $180 billion. The company’s stock is up about 22% this year, which is good news for ARKK investors. The fund holds more than 425,000 shares in Shopify. If there’s one thing Cathie Wood’s a fan of, it’s disruption. And Block (formerly known as Square) is positioned to be one of the fintech industry’s biggest disruptors. Block started out as a digital payment platform, and is still among the space’s leaders, but its expanded slate of products — the ever-evolving Cash App, recent offerings for making crypto investing easier, the recently acquired Afterpay — should allow the company to occupy a growing role in an increasingly cashless global economy. Block’s Q3 gross profits came in at $1.13 billion, a year over year increase of 43%. But the company’s share price has been all over the place this year. It’s currently down about 25% year to date. Block still takes up a fair amount of space in ARKK — about 3.3 million shares’ worth, which accounts for 3.3% of the portfolio. If you’re willing to bet on the stock market, it makes a certain kind of sense to target a company that has gambling at the heart of its business. Sports betting is booming — particularly online. The industry generated about $131 billion in revenue in 2020, according to Zion Market Research, and is projected to grow to almost $180 billion by 2028. As one of the leading fantasy sports and online bookies in the space, DraftKings stands to be at the forefront of that growth. In Q3, it expanded its operations into three additional states and brought in revenue of $213 million, a 60% increase compared to the same period last year. Wood continues to like what she sees. In addition to ARKK holding more than 12.1 million DraftKings shares, she recently added another 55,400 shares in the company to the Ark Fintech Innovation ETF. To be sure, growth stocks can be extremely volatile. And not everyone feels comfortable holding assets that make wild swings every week. If you want to invest in something that has little correlation with the ups and downs of the stock market and the crypto market, you might want to consider an overlooked asset: fine art. Contemporary artwork has already outperformed the S&P 500 by a commanding 174% over the past 25 years, according to the Citi Global Art Market chart.

12/31/2021,"Let’s talk about losses. Specifically, let’s talk about individual stock losses during a time of generally rising markets. While these situations can define stocks that are fundamentally unsound, they can also highlight stocks that are primed for rapid gains. To start with, we’re still in a long-term bullish trend. It got started back in March of 2020, when the economy hit bottom during the initial stage of the pandemic crisis. Since then, that first bounce back up has turned into a strong and sustained market rally. The S&P 500 has gained 28% in 2021, and the NASDAQ, despite a more volatile December, is up 23% for the year. Some stocks, however, haven’t joined in the general rally. This doesn’t mean that investors should avoid them; there are plenty of reasons an otherwise sound equity can fall in price. We can rely on Wall Street’s stock analysts to help sort the wheat from the chaff here, finding the stocks that have hit some bad luck but still hold potential for gains. Using TipRanks' data, we’ve found three stocks whose share price is bouncing around the bottom – but which also hold Strong Buy consensus ratings and show triple-digit upside for the coming year, according to the analyst community. Here are the details. CareCloud (MTBC) We’ll start in the healthcare industry. The current environment, with COVID still burning around the world, has focused attention on this sector, and investors can find numerous options here, from research-oriented biopharmas to administration providers. CareCloud is one of the latter, a tech provider for medical and healthcare companies. It was called MTBC until March of 2021, and while it changed its name, it did not change its core business; the company offers cloud-based solutions and tech support for back office needs including medical billing, practice management, and transcription. Over the past year, CareCloud has delivered for investors on both the top and bottom line. Revenues posted strong year-over-year gains in each of the first three quarters of the year, with the Q3 result showing 21% growth to reach $38.3 million. The company runs an EPS loss, but that loss has been moderating; the 15 cent loss recorded in Q3 was the lowest since 4Q19, and compares favorably to the 46-cent loss recorded in 3Q20. The company has delivered this performance while also launching new products. In mid-December, the company announced the launch of CareCloud Connector, a data integration tool to improve management and deployment speed. CareCloud Connector is the first product released in the CareCloud Conductor suite. Despite these positive signs for the company, MTBC shares are down 45% this year. In coverage for Cantor, 5-star analyst Steven Halper explains why he sees this drop as an opportunity for investors. ""Management [has] emphasized the company's focus on expanding its total addressable market (TAM), both organically and inorganically. In 3Q21, MTBC announced the rollout of CareCloud Conductor, which expands the company's reach into multiple new healthcare IT markets. We remind investors that MTBC acquired medSR in June 2021, which deepened the company's footprint in the health system market. Despite a relatively slow M&A quarter, MTBC continues to execute on its long term growth strategy,” Halper opined. Acknowledging the strength of the company’s forward plans, Halper rates MTBC shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and his $15 price target suggests an upside of 199% for the year ahead. (To watch Halper’s track record, click here) Looking at the Street’s consensus rating here, we can tell that Halper’s bullish view is mainstream. CareCloud has 6 reviews, and they all agree that it’s a stock to buy, for a unanimous Strong Buy rating. The shares are priced at $5.52 with an average price target of $17.50, somewhat higher than Halper allows, and suggesting a one-year upside of 217%. (See MTBC stock analysis on TipRanks) GreenPower Motor (GP) Next up is GreenPower Motor, one of the many companies that is springing up to take advantage of new openings in the electric vehicle (EV) market. GreenPower focuses on all-electric commercial vehicles, particular transit busses for the urban markets. This is the passenger version of the ‘last mile delivery’ niche that commercial EV makers are developing; by designing vehicles specifically for short-range use in urban markets close to the home charging points, they can minimize the drawbacks of limited battery range. In recent weeks, GreenPower has made several announcements highlighting the successful development and marketing of its vehicle lines. Back in early November, the company unveiled a partnership with Perrone Robotics, a maker of autonomous vehicle tech, to develop an autonomous delivery truck based on GreenPower’s AV Star line of electric vans. The companies plan demonstrations and test rides at an event in early January. In early December, GreenPower unveiled its BEAST, a Type D battery electric school bus. This is a 40-foot, heavy duty bus fit for 90 passengers and designed to meet the requirements of school district transportation departments. Finally, in mid-November, the company released its financial results for fiscal 2Q22. GreenPower showed total revenues of $4.36 million, on the delivery of 44 vehicles in the quarter. This was up from 15 vehicles delivered and $2.8 million in revenue in fiscal Q1. The company reported working capital of $31 million at the end of the quarter. On a negative note, the company’s net loss remains steep, and at $1.37 million was deeper than the Q1 loss of $1.12 million. GreenPower’s shares have been falling steadily all year. The stock is down 74% from its $32 peak, reached in January. Christopher Souther covers GreenPower for B. Riley Financial, and is impressed with the company’s ability to execute on production. He writes, “The company exited the quarter with 70 vehicles in finished good inventory and 260 vehicles in various stages of production. Management expects to deliver substantially all of the 70 finished vehicles and a portion of the 260, once completed, over the next 2 quarters..."" ""In our view,"" the analyst added, ""deliveries are likely taking longer than we previously expected due to customers waiting for clarity on the policy front. The company's pipeline continues to grow despite near-term visibility somewhat clouded, which we believe will clear once infrastructure bill/other government funding becomes more evident. We continue to like GP's positioning in the growing medium- and heavy-duty vehicle market with its unique, validated product.” Souther’s comments back up his Buy rating, and his $24 price target implies a robust upside of ~190% for the next 12 months. (To watch Souther’s track record, click here) While GreenPower’s Strong Buy consensus rating is not unanimous, it is based on a 3 to 1 split in favor of Buy over Hold reviews. The stock is currently selling for $8.20 and the average price target of $23.86 implies an upside of ~191% from that level. (See GP stock analysis on TipRanks) Codiack BioSciences (CDAK) Last but not least is Codiak BioSciences, a company taking a unique approach to the development of therapeutic agents. Codiak is working with exosomes, the degradation mechanism RNA, to create a new class of medicines capable of transferring genetic material for therapeutic effect. Codiak has created a propriety exosome engineering platform (engEX) to develop drugs for the treatment of a wide range of disease conditions, all with high unmet medical needs. Codiak’s exosome development has created proteins that carry drug molecules through cell walls by mimicking viral pathways – but without the disease effects of a virus. The development program has potential to create medicinal agents that will target particular cells, and carry precise drug molecules directly to the target area. The company’s pipeline currently has 10 separate research tracks, eight in discovery and preclinical phases, and two in Phase 1 human clinical trials. The two active clinical trials involve exoIL-12, a treatment for several cancers, including CTCL, melanoma, TNBC, MCC, Kaposi & GBM. The trial has been ongoing for over one year. The trial has 12 healthy volunteer and patients with early stage cutaneous T cell lymphoma. The company plans to add other cancers to the trial pending early data. The second clinical trial underway involves exoSTING, a potential treatment for solid tumor cancers. The current clinical trial is at Phase 1/2, and is testing the drug’s efficacy against several solid tumors, including metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Finally, at the end of November, the company announced that it had received clearance from the FDA, in response to the IND submission, to begin the trial of exoASO-STAT6, a treatment for myeloid-rich cancers. Patient dosing in the Phase 1 clinical trial is set to begin in 1H22. In another important development, Codiak announced in December new pre-clinical data from its exoVACC vaccine research platform. The data release showed that the exosome-based vaccine platform can cause a comprehensive immune response to SARS-CoV-2, and shows potential against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants. These are all solid developments for the company, and show an active research program with a high potential – but even so, the stock is down 68% this year. According to Wedbush’s 5-star analyst David Nierengarten, however, investors can use this as an opportunity. Nierengarten says of Codiak’s pipeline: “While CDAK’s exoVACC technology is still in early stages, we think the data presented demonstrate the advantages and potential applications of an exosome-based platform in vaccines, particularly for rapidly mutating viruses. In the nearer term, we continue to look to the updated Ph 1/2 exoSTING data, and the initial safety and early efficacy data for exoIL-12 expected in 1H22, as the main catalysts for CDAK shares.” To this end, Nierengarten rates CDAK shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), while his $34 price target indicates room for 226% share growth going forward next year. (To watch Nierengarten’s track record, click here) Overall, this stock has a unanimous Strong Buy consensus from the Street, based on 3 positive reviews. The average price target of $39.50 is even more bullish than Nierengarten’s and implies a one-year upside potential of 280% from the current trading price of $10.45.

12/31/2021,"A cosmetics and skin care products company founded by married Taiwanese actors Zhang Ting and Lin Ruiyang has had assets worth 600 million yuan (US$94 million) frozen due to an investigation by China's market regulator over an alleged pyramid scheme. The market regulator in Shijiazhuang, the capital of northern China's Hebei province, said it had received several reports about a suspected pyramid scheme involving Shanghai Dowell Trading, according to a letter widely circulated on Chinese social media platforms on Tuesday. ""Because of its use of financial institutions to transfer or conceal funds involved in pyramid schemes, the administration has applied to the People's Court to take preservation measures under the law, and the case is currently under further investigation,"" said the letter dated last week. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Shanghai Dowell Trading responded on Wednesday, and said that it ""is a legally operating company that has always complied with the government guidance, adhered to the legal operation, and paid taxes according to the law"". ""We are very grateful to the Administration for Market Regulation of Shijiazhuang Yuhua District for guiding our company to check the risk; at present, the company is operating normally. Our company will actively cooperate with relevant departments,"" said the statement on the company's Twitter-like Weibo account. Shanghai Dowell Trading, which was founded in 1996, is the main operator of cosmetics and skin care products brand TST Tin'Secret, which lists Taiwanese model-actress Lin Chi-ling as a spokeswoman. Chinese actor Xu Zheng is also a former shareholder, while several famous Chinese stars have posted photos on social media using the brand's face masks. The Taiwan Affairs Office within China's State Council said at a regular press conference on Wednesday that the business incident had nothing to do with cross-strait relations. Taiwanese model-actress Lin Chi-ling is listed as a spokeswoman for TST Tin'Secret. Photo: Handout alt=Taiwanese model-actress Lin Chi-ling is listed as a spokeswoman for TST Tin'Secret. Photo: Handout> ""I want to emphasise that anyone running or starting a business in the mainland must first and foremost follow the law and regulations,"" said Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Ma Xiaoguang. Lin made a name for himself starring in the Chinese TV series Fantasies Behind The Pearly Curtains in the 1970s, while Zhang featured in the Legendary Chien Lung TV series in 1991. Pyramid schemes, which are illegal in China like many other countries, are businesses that recruit people whose job is to enrol others into the scheme rather than selling a specific product or service. The business model means only a few people at the top of the pyramid earn money, while the large number at the bottom will make little to zero return on their investment. Taiwanese actors Zhang Ting and Lin Ruiyang founded Shanghai Dowell Trading in 1996. Photo: Weibo alt=Taiwanese actors Zhang Ting and Lin Ruiyang founded Shanghai Dowell Trading in 1996. Photo: Weibo> They are similar to multilevel marketing in terms of structure, but do not involve a specific product. As early as 2016, the Beijing Youth Daily newspaper reported several skin irritation and acne cases caused by the face masks. The ""China Consumer Reports"" journal also featured cases of skin damage caused by the products as one of its annual cases as part of International Consumer Rights Day in 2017. Li Xu, the founder of the Chinese civil society organisation ""Li Xu anti-multi-level marketing team,"" said Shanghai Dowell Trading uses three typical features of a pyramid scheme, namely the need to pay a joining fee, the number of people involved and the method of payment. The correlation between agents' salaries and the size of their teams means the more members people bring in, the more commission they receive, he added. Li said traditional pyramid schemes are based on pure money flow and are more likely to gather funds in the name of investment, which differs from the current pyramid micronet businesses that own legitimate companies and products. ""They have legitimate companies as a cover and will even have celebrity endorsements, but it's still a pyramid scheme in nature,"" said Li. Shanghai Dowell Trading was recognised for making the highest annual tax payment in Shanghai's Qingpu District in both 2017 and 2018, with the company claiming to have paid 2.1 billion yuan (US$330 million) in tax in 2018 alone.
