1/5/2022,"Hello, happy brunch-time and a big welcome back to everyone except La Niña, who I resent even when she’s watering my garden. This is Five Great Reads, a weekday summertime wrap of interest, service and sweet, sweet juice picked out by me, Alyx Gorman, lifestyle editor of Guardian Australia. You may notice today’s reads are arriving a little later in the morning. That’s because my esteemed colleagues over at the Morning Mail are back on tools and summarising the news first thing, just for you. And if you’d like to read through the day’s events as they unfold, you can do so at our live blog.  Finally, a paragraph later than expected, comes a reminder that if you’re reading this as an article, you can also receive it as an email by putting your address in the box below. To the people who are already receiving this as an email, I am sorry I keep saying this, and even more sorry you can’t see the box. It’s a very nice box. Now we’re done with the box chat, onto the reads. Five people who survived terrifying wild animal attacks share their stories and the way these incidents shaped their lives. Which terrifying animals? A mountain lion, a shark, a bear, a hippo and an otter. An otter? An otter. Otters aren’t terrifying. “The otter kept torpedoing underwater to bite my legs,” says Leah Hiller. “It would come up, track where I was, and attack again. I knew I couldn’t outswim it, so I just had to brace for the bites and try to protect my neck because, if it hit me there, I would have drowned.” “These sharp, searing bites were coming from every angle,” she continues. “It bit me 25 times. Some of them were two inches deep and one pierced my ankle bone.” How long will it take me to read? Like many of the animals mentioned, this is a big one. It’ll take about nine minutes to read. But if you can’t be tempted into reading 4,000 words of personal experience on animal attacks (with a gently eco bent) then honestly, you just can’t be pleased. Bonus read: Okay, one last attempt to please you with a very good boy instead: a dog that saved a hiker’s life in the Croatian mountains. As millions around the world grapple with long-Covid, “we need to respect the process of healing” writes GP Gavin Francis. Notable quote: “Convalescence is anything but a passive process,” Francis writes. This realisation came to him while he worked on a brain injury rehabilitation ward as a junior doctor. “Though its rhythms and its tempo are often slow and gentle, it’s an act, and actions need us to be present, to engage, to give of ourselves.” How long will it take me to read? Eight minutes. But it’s a must for anyone who has ever fallen and taken a while to get up. Film critic Guy Loge on the best performances this award season has overlooked. What’s in it for me? You’ll end up with a long list of movies to watch, from Norwegian dramadies to spiky road trip flicks to a horror movie so scary-sounding I can’t watch the trailer. How many movies? 16 Stephen Marche certainly seems to think so. In an extract from his new book the Next Civil War, he makes his case. Notable quote: “The right has recognised what the left has not: that the system is in collapse,” Marche writes. “The right has a plan: it involves violence and solidarity. They have not abjured even the Oath Keepers. The left, meanwhile, has chosen infighting as their sport.”How long will it take to read? About four minutes. Bonus read: After finishing Marche’s piece, you might just forgive the Americans for trying to be rid of the phrase “no worries”. They do seem to have worries. Finally, here’s Celina Ribeiro on how a couple of dry nights a week have helped change her relationship with alcohol.",News/Australia news,"Five great reads: animal attacks, the art of recovery, overlooked actors and an easy way to drink less",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/05/five-great-reads-animal-attacks-the-art-of-recovery-overlooked-actors-and-an-easy-way-to-drink-less
1/5/2022,"PEN15 (Sky Comedy) started out as a show that leaned on the grotesqueness of the teenage experience, and was constructed on the foundations of a largely visual joke – that the 13-year-old versions of the two protagonists, Maya and Anna, were played by actors in their 30s, while the other 13-year-olds around them were played by actors of that age. Yet its early fondness for a gross-out gag has evolved and it has matured into a remarkably sensitive and beautiful series about life, friendship and growing up. This run of final episodes, which conclude a second season delayed by the pandemic, mark the end of the show. It is bowing out at the peak of its powers. It returns with Bat Mitzvah, in which Becca, one of the Mean Girls-esque characters who is far more popular than Maya or Anna, has her batmitzvah, having been reminded to chase her classmates’ RSVPs during a lesson about the Holocaust. Becca’s disdain for Maya, a running theme of the series, turns a party into a finely tuned study of peer pressure and economic status, as Maya starts to realise that her family cannot buy Swarovski jewellery with the same ease as some of her classmates. When Maya hands Becca the gift she has forced her father to buy, it is a terrible, awkward snapshot of teen power dynamics and porcelain-thin self-esteem.  Often awkward and usually excruciating, PEN15 conjures all the most painful parts of growing up and forces its characters to act them out, slowly, as if tiptoeing over a cliff edge. While Maya is learning about her social class, Anna is having an existential crisis, brought on by the discovery that there is evil in the world. Her parents’ divorce is exacerbating her anxiety, and the pressure of the newfound suspicion that life is pointless leads to alcohol, a kiss and a potential new boyfriend. All the great levelling drama of being a teen is here, from trying to be popular to wondering how God could allow great suffering to happen. It all exists in the same heightened emotional state. By this stage of PEN15, it is largely easy to forget that Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle, who created the show as well as starring in it, are not 13, which is a credit to its keen eye for detail. It takes place in an American middle school, but you don’t need to be familiar with American schools to relate. It is set in 2000, but its retro appeal is also confined to the background now, and mostly to quick jokes about Discmans, waiting for a phone call that might never come, or endless conversations on the landline. (You know, the thing you couldn’t use when the dial-up was on.) Instead, it has blossomed into an intelligent and creative comedy. It has style and flair, tipping into the surreal when it feels appropriate, never afraid to be inventive. One episode unfolds from the perspective of Maya’s mother, Yuki (played by Erkine’s real mother). There is a scene involving amphetamines at a funeral, a clever use of glow sticks and light to convey a panic attack, and, in one especially tense moment, a use of perspective that is wordlessly devastating. If some of its early, cruder humour has been lost, that seems like a fair exchange. What remains is still funny and sometimes hilarious, though it is all tempered with fragility, and the sense that the characters are not quite grown-up enough to deal with what the world is throwing at them, until they do deal with it, usually together. This is sweet without being sickly, and that is a rare and hard-won balancing act. Its tone is perfectly judged. The show is so pitifully accurate about how cringeworthy teenage life can be that, at times, it is tough to watch. I put my hands over my eyes more frequently while viewing this than I would during a horror film. Towards its end, with the arrival of a sinister stoner named Derek, the series takes on a darker hue. Death intrudes on Anna’s life, and sex begins to nudge its way into Anna and Maya’s immediate world. I found the very last episode surprisingly upsetting, and wondered if this was really how it would end. And then it pulled out its PEN15 superpower, turned its lights up, and became something touching and brilliant again.",Arts/Television & radio,PEN15 review – the most captivating cringe-comedy on TV bows out on a high,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/04/pen15-review-the-most-captivating-cringe-comedy-on-tv-bows-out-on-a-high
1/5/2022,"So many young people in Australia are testing positive to Covid that videos about their experiences are going viral on TikTok. One popular trend involves users posting videos of their positive rapid antigen test, or some other situation showing they have Covid, with the voiceover: “Yep that’s me, you’re probably wondering how I ended up in this situation.” That is then cut with a video of them doing legal but high-risk activities – such as dancing at a music festival – to the sound of Boney M’s Rasputin.

Other videos show users struggling to get their hand on a rapid antigen test or waiting in long queues at Covid testing centres. “Gorgeous gorgeous girls Afterpay their rapid antigen test,” writes TikTok user @eilishgilligan, in a statement that attempts to capture the mood of young people living in Australia’s major cities.

According to New South Wales department of health statistics, 38,407 people between the ages of 20 and 29 tested positive for Covid-19 in the past seven days – 28% of the total cases. In Victoria, there were 18,467 active cases in the same cohort – 38% of the total. Victoria’s Covid logistics chief, Jeroen Weimar, admitted on Tuesday the state’s actual figures were likely higher but he said about 30-40% of cases being picked up were in people aged 20 to 40. As rapid antigen tests become increasingly hard to come by and PCR testing queues report hours-long waiting times, the Monash University infectious disease modeller Dr Michael Lydeamore said it was unlikely government statistics were capturing the magnitude of the outbreak. “We are just not getting an accurate picture of what’s happening,” he said. Lydeamore said part of the problem was that there was no way to capture the results of rapid antigen tests. “In the UK, for example, there is a barcode on every test, and a QR code,” he said. “You can scan that with your phone and put in your information and record your test result and then the health agency can access that for reporting. “We don’t have that system here and so there are all these people testing positive with RATs, doing the right thing and staying home, but we have no way to know about them.” Although countless TikTok users claim they picked up the virus while celebrating New Year’s Eve, Lydeamore said several factors contributed to the high positive rates among people in their 20s. That cohort were traditionally key transmitters during outbreaks of infectious disease, he said. Not only because of their social contacts but because they also tended to work in high-risk settings such as retail, hospitality and busy offices. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Lydeamore said the timeline of the vaccine rollout also contributed to the high case numbers. “A lot of people in that age category are pretty far from their primary dose and not yet eligible for a booster. And that’s going to put them more at risk potentially of acquiring the virus.” Some young people on social media have said – most likely in jest – they were lucky to have tested positive before the recent outbreak so they could move on with their lives. “Smashing out c0v1d early so I can have an uninterrupted hot v@x summer,” says one user, 28-year-old Georgia Milhe (@brokebutmakeitboujee), who tested positive for Covid in November.

She said joking about the situation was a cathartic release and, despite her comment, she remained concerned she would be impacted by the current Omicron outbreak. She was doing her best to avoid exposure, reporting a similar attitude among her circle of friends. “You have to laugh or you’ll cry,” Milhe said. “I don’t think people are taking it lightly, I just think they’re trying to cope. This situation – to think that it’s going to still be going on and getting worse than it was after all the lockdowns – it’s pretty crap.” Other users have joked about trying to get the virus now so they can isolate with their housemates and partners. But Lydeamore warned against this strategy. “Even though younger people have a much lower chance of getting a severe disease, it’s certainly not zero,” he said. “There’s plenty of people under 30 in hospital and in intensive care. And every time you get Covid, that is something that could happen to you.” He also pointed to reports from South Africa of people suffering “distinct infections as little as a month apart”.

You just have to try and protect yourself as best as you can, the closer quarters [make it] harder, but you just have to do your best.”",News/Australia news,‘Gorgeous girls Afterpay their rapid antigen test’: TikTokers say it is cathartic to make light of Omicron,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/05/gorgeous-girls-afterpay-their-rapid-antigen-test-tiktokers-say-it-is-cathartic-to-make-light-of-omicron
