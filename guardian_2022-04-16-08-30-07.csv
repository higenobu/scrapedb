4/16/2022,"Teachers have raised concerns about the influence of “incel” subculture on teenage boys, as a survey revealed that seven in 10 female teachers have been victims of misogyny in school. The poll by the NASUWT teachers’ union confirmed a significant culture of sexual harassment and misogyny in classrooms, with almost 60% of those who participated saying they had experienced misogyny from pupils. The union, which has 300,000 UK members, says it is “deeply concerned” about the level of misogyny that is faced by women, trans and non-binary members, and students, on a regular basis. It is also worried about a lack of government initiatives to tackle the subculture of “involuntary celibates” (“incels”), warning that teenage boys are finding themselves drawn into their views because of a lack of support from other, more appropriate, sources. The term incel is used for men who define themselves as unable to get a romantic or sexual partner and express online hostility and resentment towards those who are sexually active, particularly women. Discussions in such internet forums are often hate-filled and deeply misogynistic. According to recent reports, Jake Davison, who gunned down seven people, killing five, in a rampage in Plymouth in 2021 has been lionised by the online incel community, and data has shown the number of visits to forums has increased by almost sixfold in nine months. Delegates taking part in the NASUWT annual conference in Birmingham over the Easter weekend will debate the issue, after a survey of more than 1,500 female members showed 72% had been a victim of misogyny in their school and more than half (53%) said their school was not doing enough to tackle the problem. The motion up for debate calls on the national executive to lobby government for misogyny to be recognised as a hate crime. It also says the incel community should be considered an extremist group, based on its links to “alt-right” viewpoints and hatred of women, and calls for further research into the effect incel communities have on young boys within schools and colleges, which will report back to conference next year. The motion also calls on the union to lobby for fully funded mental health and wellbeing programmes aimed at boys, stressing the need for early intervention from mental health services. Kathryn Downs, a secondary school teacher from Leeds who proposed the motion, said: “A study in October 2021 suggested that there was a 6.3% chance of being suggested an incel-related video by YouTube within five ‘hops’ of a non-incel related video. Given the amount of time our young people spend on social media, this is 6.3% too much. Clearly this shows the dangers of failing to support and improve the mental wellbeing of boys within schools.” According to the NASUWT poll, misogyny emanated from across the school community – 58% experienced misogyny from pupils, 45% from the senior leadership team, 42% from other teachers, 30% from their headteacher and 27% from parents. The majority of respondents complained of intimidatory, undermining or unprofessional behaviour (76%), comments about ability (51%), intellect (33%), body (32%), teaching style (30%) and clothing (29%), while 3% of cases cited sexual and physical violence. One in 20 said the misogyny had been posted on social media including Facebook, WhatsApp and TikTok. Of those respondents who reported misogyny to their school, 45% said no action was taken and one in five teachers said they were not believed or their claims were dismissed. Two in five said misogyny had affected promotional opportunities and more than a quarter (27%) said it affected pay. Participants in the survey provided a long list of examples of the kind of misogyny they faced. One said: “Children regularly make sexist comments about women’s roles in the home and in the workplace. Children making comments about feminism being a terrible thing and explaining it as man hating, or even the wish to kill men.” Another teacher wrote: “Students exposed themselves during a lesson, sexual gestures, sex noises made during the lesson to intimidate.” Another contribution said: “Year 9 boys asking in class if I’d had breast implants. I have had my backside grabbed in corridor by pupils.” Another said: “My mentor when I was teacher training said he was going to ‘tie me up and rape me’.” On misogyny from colleagues, one said: “WhatsApp group which included only male members of staff. A member of SLT commented that I was hot and several teachers agreed.” Another reported: “Senior leaders being dismissive and undermining of female teachers in front of male pupils. Male pupils ignoring instructions from female teachers.” Dr Patrick Roach, the NASUWT general secretary, said: “It is outrageous that so many women teachers continue to suffer this kind of appalling abuse in their workplaces. Our schools and colleges must be safe places for all staff and no woman should ever feel harassed, scared or intimidated just by going to work.” A government spokesperson said: “In no circumstances should teachers be subjected to abuse simply for doing their jobs. Any report of sexual violence or sexual harassment to school leadership teams should be taken seriously. “Staff working in education should also receive regular safeguarding training to support them to spot and handle instances of abuse and harassment among pupils or staff.”",News/Education,"70% of female teachers have faced misogyny in UK schools, poll shows",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/16/female-teachers-misogyny-schools-culture-sexual-harassment-classrooms-incel

4/16/2022,"Five years on from the Grenfell fire, the focus needs to shift back to the young people directly affected by the tragedy, according to those behind a new charity single that features cameos from Top Boy’s Ashley Walters and AJ Tracey. West Side Story, which will be released on 6 May, has been produced by Toddla T and features rappers and singers from the areas surrounding the tower, who discuss their feelings of loss, grief and hope as the fifth anniversary approaches. Much of the focus has shifted to the government response and to the eye-watering bills homeowners are facing to solve the problem of unsafe cladding, but the song homes in on the human cost of the fire. G2 Slime – real name Adjei Isaac – raps about his friend Jessica Urbano Ramirez, who was one of the 72 people who died. He said the tragedy had “changed him as a person”, making him aware of the fragility of life and the need to make the most of opportunities. Other local acts including Double C also take part, with one half of the duo Ajani rapping: “Had thoughts in my head / That I can’t control / I gotta rise / Nobody knows what I go through.” Walters and AJ Tracey, who is from Ladbroke Grove, appear in the video, which also features dancing by a Grenfell survivor, Luana Gomes. Michael Defoe, the chief executive of the Harrow Club, a youth centre in the heart of the Grenfell area, said there was a “feeling of helplessness” for some people after the fire and the lack of prosecutions, but young people had proven to be incredibly resilient. “I think from the young people’s perspective, they’re still affected by the loss of their friends, but at the same time, lots of things have changed for them in terms of their own personal development and they’re trying to move on,” he said. Proceeds from the single will go to the charity One Vibe, established in the immediate aftermath of the fire. Set up by Mel Rudder, a music executive, and Palmira Morais, who works in the BBC’s comedy department, the charity has hosted events and provided support for young people in the Ladbroke Grove area. Morais said being confronted by the tower was like “walking past a cemetery” for some people and she wanted to create something positive to mark the anniversary. She knows Toddla T, who has supported One Vibe previously and donated proceeds from his single Carnival Love to the charity, and they began to plan the West Side Story single. Morais said West Side Story and One Vibe were both born out a desire to help young people and improve their wellbeing. She said: “They were under so much stress and suffered post-traumatic stress and the true cost is still unknown. We won’t even know the numbers for years to come.” Toddla T said he hoped the single was a way to respectfully remember the people who lost their lives in the fire and would also send out a hopeful message for the survivors and others directly affected. “It’s about hope, as well as what’s happened, which should be remembered, talked about and respected, but it’s also about looking forward,” he said.",News/UK news,Charity single recalls human cost of Grenfell tragedy five years on,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/16/charity-single-recalls-human-cost-of-grenfell-tragedy-five-years-on
4/16/2022,"Donald Trump has picked a side in the contentious Republican primary for US Senate in Ohio, backing JD Vance, the bestselling author of the memoir Hillbilly Elegy. In doing so on Friday, the former president chose to forgive Vance’s previous opposition to him and caustic comments about Trump. Predicting a midterm “landslide for Republicans that will serve as a devastating rebuke of the failures of Joe Biden and the Radical Left Democrats”, Trump said: “In the great state of Ohio, the candidate most qualified and ready to win in November is JD Vance. “We cannot play games. It is all about winning!” Vance is not in a winning position in polls of the Ohio field. According to the RealClearPolitics.com average on Friday, Josh Mandel held a 1.7-point lead over Mike Gibbons, with Vance in third. Polling day is 3 May. This week, as reports of an imminent endorsement circulated, Ohio Republicans were reported to have called on Trump not to back any candidate. Citing a draft of a letter to Trump, the Associated Press said the GOP figures pointed to Vance’s past statements. “We know there are many qualified candidates in this race who have stood up for the ‘America First’ agenda over the years and have carried the Trump mantle over the years, again with the notable exception of JD Vance,” the letter said. “While we were working hard in Ohio to support you and Make America Great Again, JD Vance was actively working against your candidacy.” The letter pointed to Vance saying he might support Hillary Clinton in 2016 and comparing Trump to “another opioid”. Hillbilly Elegy, which was made into a film released in 2020, deals with growing up in a part of America hit hard by the opioid epidemic. Writing for the Guardian in 2016, Sarah Smarsh said: “A successful attorney who had a precariously middle-class upbringing in an Ohio steel town, Vance wrote of the chaos that can haunt a family with generational memory of deep poverty. “A conservative who says he won’t vote for Trump, Vance speculates about why working-class whites will: cultural anxiety that arises when opioid overdose kills your friends and the political establishment has proven it will throw you under the bus.” Vance, also a former US Marine and a venture capitalist, has said he regrets his comments about Trump. “Like a lot of people, I criticized Trump back in 2016,” he told Fox News last year. “And I ask folks not to judge me based on what I said in 2016, because I’ve been very open that I did say those critical things and I regret them, and I regret being wrong about the guy.” In his endorsement, Trump said: “Like some others, JD Vance may have said some not so great things about me in the past, but he gets it now, and I have seen that in spades. “He is our best chance for victory in what could be a very tough race. The Democrats will be spending many millions of dollars but the good news is that they have a defective candidate who ran for president and garnered exactly zero percent in the polls. The bottom line is, we must have a Republican victory in Ohio.” Vance said he was “incredibly honored to have President Trump’s support”, adding: “He was an incredible fighter for hard working Americans in the White House, he will be again, and I’ll fight for the America First agenda in the Senate.” The Democrat Trump referred to is Tim Ryan, a congressman who mounted a short-lived run for the presidential nomination in 2020. On Friday, Ryan said: “It’s official. Donald Trump just called me ‘dangerous’ to Republicans in a ‘tough race’ and threw his support behind JD Vance. Vance is a Silicon Valley elitist and a phony, and we’ll beat him come November.” Seeking donations, Ryan added: “We’re beating JD Vance in the polls by one point. But we’re expecting this endorsement to bring a new wave of outside money and attacks.” Trump’s endorsements are under scrutiny, as observers seek to determine the strength of his hold on the Republican party ahead of a likely third White House run. Last week Trump endorsed in the Republican Senate primary in Pennsylvania, choosing Mehmet Oz, a doctor made famous on daytime TV, over David McCormick, a candidate favored by many Republican insiders. The Republican primary in Ohio has become increasingly heated. In a debate earlier this month, Mandel and Gibbons physically threatened each other on stage. Vance remarked: “It was embarrassing, especially for those involved. I think it was embarrassing for the whole party.”",News/US news,Trump endorses Hillbilly Elegy author JD Vance in Ohio Republican primaries,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/15/donald-trump-endorses-jd-vance-ohio-senate-primaries
