4/15/2022,"Rebecca Lloyd, One Nation’s candidate for the Queensland federal seat of Brisbane, has been disendorsed by the party just days after it was revealed the Australian Electoral Commission was investigating a Facebook page linked to her. On Friday, Lloyd’s candidate page on the One Nation website, and her associated One Nation Facebook page were removed by the party. She posted an “urgent SOS” video on the Fair Business Australia Facebook page, claiming her profiles had been removed by One Nation after a dispute over her response to news reports on the AEC probe. “I produced a video where I demanded a retraction from the statements and a retraction from the stories. I was asked to pull that video down and I refused to pull that video down,” she said. “I was then asked again urgently to pull that video down and I did not pull that video down. And now if you go to search for me through any of the One Nation channels, you will not find me there.” A One Nation spokesperson confirmed Lloyd had been disendorsed by the party on Friday. “Her unwillingness to work with and follow direction from One Nation’s executive as part of this team has led to the regrettable, but unanimous, decision to disendorse Ms Lloyd as the party’s candidate for Brisbane.” On Tuesday, Guardian Australia reported the AEC was examining a Facebook page called “Join the Conversation”, which describes itself as a community page connecting people with minor candidates. The page did not carry an authorisation statement required for political content from parties or candidates. A domain search for its associated website shows it is registered to Lloyd, and a company called Fair Business Australia. In the video, Lloyd claimed she was “being attacked by the Greens party and MSM” and she had recorded a call she made with the AEC claiming they had not heard of her, and she claimed she was not being investigated by the AEC. An AEC spokesperson told Guardian Australia on Tuesday the page would be examined. “There are potential civil penalties [for not including an authorisation statement] but our first port of call is always to get it corrected. If it’s needed, we’d get in contact with them and ask them to apply one.” Lloyd has cited Join the Conversation and Fair Business Australia – previously known as “No Vax Id” – on her Facebook and LinkedIn pages. Lloyd’s profile of the site says the former singer turned small business consultant stands for “ending all mandates and ensuring unelected bureaucrats never interfere with our freedoms again”. One Nation has very little time to find a replacement, with candidate nominations closing on 21 April. The party had said it was running candidates in all 151 electorates.",News/Australia news,One Nation dumps Brisbane candidate Rebecca Lloyd days after AEC investigation revealed,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/15/one-nation-dumps-brisbane-candidate-rebecca-lloyd-days-after-aec-investigation-revealed
4/15/2022,"The anthology series Roar (Apple TV+), from the makers of GLOW, promises eight standalone stories about “what it means to be a woman today”. Considering that these stories involve sex with a duck, teeth emerging from bloody wounds and teenage “incels” in basements, what it means to be a woman today is certainly unsettling. This is an adaptation of a collection of short stories by Cecelia Ahern, and its weird streak is enjoyable. It helps that it comes with ample star power: Nicole Kidman, Issa Rae and Cynthia Erivo star, among many others. The title of each episode is also the sum of its plot, and sometimes this is exposing. The Woman Who Ate Photographs has Kidman attempting to care for her mother – who has dementia – and beginning to eat photographs, causing a powerful visual and physical nostalgia, as if she were back in the moment she has just consumed. The Woman Who Found Bite Marks on her Skin has Erivo playing an executive and mother who develops bloody wounds when the pull of family life starts to intrude upon her work – or perhaps it’s the other way around. In The Woman Who Disappeared, Rae is a memoirist being courted by Hollywood after her book is a smash hit, but who begins literally to disappear when trying to stand her ground in a meeting led by three identikit corporate white men. The Woman Who Was Fed by a Duck, meanwhile, has Merritt Wever as a woman in her 30s who is tired of being single and is seduced by a suitor who doesn’t seem to be “defective”, unlike many of the men she meets. Not only is the suitor a duck, he’s a duck who pretends to be a feminist, but who also has a nasty streak. There are some scenes in this episode that are indelible in the mind. Each instalment is about women who either feel – or are – unheard, unseen, or sometimes both. The four standouts take this notion and strap it to a more solid storyline. Betty Gilpin stars in The Woman Who Was Kept on a Shelf as a former model who becomes a literal trophy wife, until she tires of being passively adored and dances her way back out into the world. It’s The Artist Is Present as performed by Betty Friedan. Roar is indulgent enough to allow itself an extended and lovely musical interlude, and it is at its best when that more experimental and confident side has the space to shine. GLOW alum Alison Brie is The Woman Who Solved her Own Murder, playing the ghost of a murder victim who must hear all the assumptions the boorish detectives make about her life as they investigate the crime. In what is probably the best of the bunch, Meera Syal is The Woman Who Returned her Husband. It takes place in an Edward Scissorhands-style, brightly lit suburbia, and turns into a touching and surprisingly frank exploration of marriage, routine and the conflict between endurance and happiness. And The Girl Who Loved Horses is a mini-western/buddy movie that looks fantastic and makes excellent use of Alfred Molina as a baddie. When this series is at its weakest, the concepts struggle to become more than just that. These episodes are based on clever ideas, neat “what if?”s, but some of them don’t quite stretch to 30 minutes’ worth of storytelling. That’s not to say they aren’t entertaining, or thought-provoking, in their own ways, though they do have a tendency to leave little room for the audience to interpret, as the point is explained with a heavy hand. As is often the case with anthologies, then, it is a mixed bag, at times more of a curiosity than it is a fully realised vision. But when it works, it really works, and even when it doesn’t quite come together, it is different enough to demand your attention. That is, after all, what these women are trying to do.",Arts/Television & radio,Roar review – female star power … and sex with a duck,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/15/roar-review-female-star-power-and-sex-with-a-duck
4/15/2022,"“Violet, Violin, Violence, Violator,” San reads in an English-to-Korean dictionary in Kyung-sook Shin’s newly translated 2001 novel, Violets. Within a few lines the dictionary goes from the beautiful flowers to “one who breaks rules, invades, insults, rapes”. Violets is a novel built on the proximity of beauty and violence. Shin became known in the west with her 2011 novel Please Look After Mother, which sold 2m copies and won the Man Asian literary prize. In that book a grandmother disappears after a lifetime of serving others, and Shin said she wanted to explore the values that had gone missing “as we turned to modernity”. There were multiple viewpoints, of people in their 40s and older. In Violets, Shin homes in on the single perspective of San in adolescence and her early 20s. The novel is set in 1970s South Korea, an era in which violence and repression were endemic. We don’t see any large-scale social unrest; instead Shin finds indirect and nuanced ways to conjure the atmosphere of a place where flourishing is thwarted at every turn. The book opens in a rural village on the edge of industrialisation, where San’s family are outsiders – her father works in a factory rather than farming, and rides a motorcycle – and San is ostracised. Her father leaves and her mother periodically disappears as well, lured away by new lovers. Redemption comes for a while through a best friend, Namae, but, on a sticky May day, the friendship ends abruptly. Playing, they end up swimming fully clothed in a river. Afterwards, drying naked alongside each other, stretched out side by side “like a pair of chopsticks”, they embrace and kiss. San thinks: “I will love you more than myself.” Namae runs off, full of shame, and refuses to see her friend again. For San this begins a lifetime of loneliness, transmuting sexual desire into a masochistic urge towards violence. There is a brief efflorescence of happiness when she moves to Seoul in her early 20s, gets a job in a flower shop and becomes close friends and roommates with her co-worker, Su-ae. The flowers themselves, in their vulnerability, beauty and need for care, are lovingly described. “Satiny white gardenia flowers unfurl between luscious green leaves, and the queen-of-the-night cactus bursts into spectacular fuchsia blossoms.” San’s identification with the flowers is explicit: “whenever she wipes the window or sprinkles the plants exposed out on the street, it’s her own fragile inner self that she’s watering”. This cannot last, and neither can her easy daily intimacy with Su-ae. There is the sense that this friendship can only be half-hearted, because San’s fear of abandonment and impulse towards violence are both so strong. Her downfall begins when she becomes attracted to a womanising photographer who comes to the flower shop. A passing moment of flirtation spins into obsession – so much so that she feels that he enters her as a kind of inner demon, accompanying her through life even as the real man remains a stranger. From this point, her masochism gets more dangerous, and the bond with Su-ae no longer claims her. Shin writes that the desires of San’s childhood, which she has tried to sublimate, reawaken as “a fresh green sadness”: “San’s attraction did not originate this summer, but rather, it has lain in wait for millennia before bursting forth all at once.” The narrator goes on to say that this cry “for centuries was never given an ear”, turning San’s experience into the experience of centuries of other women. This is one of several moments when the narrative voice takes over, appearing to have more power and agency than the characters. Another time, we are told that San’s loneliness and melancholy is not hers alone. “A young woman on an escalator, a young man silently walking from building to building with a résumé in hand … the same expression appears and disappears from their faces.” There is something overdetermined about this, and Shin was probably wise to move to a subtler narrative voice in Please Look After Mother. The all-knowing narrator can feel a little arch, but at its best, there’s a timeless, fable-like quality to the narration that makes the story strange and gripping. Because the narrator is so powerful, San herself seems to have terrifyingly little control over her destiny from moment to moment – itself a feeling presented as universal at this time in Seoul. Shin has an intense feeling for place, and an ability to bring it alive not as mere setting but as intensely felt imaginative terrain. It feels at times that San’s self-destructive loneliness could be the self-destructive loneliness of many of the young women surrounding her, because the city itself is characterised as so lonely a place. It’s not surprising that there turn out to be as many violators as violets. What remains unclear is whether the beauty and delicacy of the violets can provide any larger redemption.

4/15/2022,"Bob Vylan’s second album doubles down on their no-holds-barred social commentary, taking aim at not-so-Great Britain and plotting the gulf between wealth-hoarding leaders and skint citizens doing what they can to get by. Amid energy crises and fat-cat tax dissent, their message couldn’t be timelier. Wicked & Bad chimes with similar horns to Stormzy’s Big Michael but quickly transforms into an irresistible mosh pit-starter, thick with sledgehammer sloganeering. The provocations of Take That are even more exciting: hauling Churchill statues into the sea, wiping backsides with St George’s flags, bemoaning a government that is “killing off kids with £2 chicken and chips”. The latter line is cleverly reheated on Health Is Wealth, an informative reggae-rap that would probably get Jamie Oliver’s approval. Compared to the rest of the album, it’s borderline cheerful, a much-needed pause for breath. For all their lyrical fury, the production sometimes begs to be richer, to really make your speakers shake as much as their words threaten to breach the peace. The drill of Must Be More strikes a little too bluntly, while Turn Off the Radio shrouds killer lines about racial stereotypes and musical cliches in an ironically dull nu-metal chorus. These criticisms won’t fuss them: as Pretty Songs makes clear, their punk is designed to ruffle feathers, not appease the masses. If you’re willing to meet Bob Vylan on their rough-and-ready terms, The Price of Life offers a decent return on investment.

4/15/2022,"This bizarre 2018 film is another staging post in the cult renaissance of Nicolas Cage – one that will probably reach its apogee this Friday with the release of The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, a comedy in which he stars as himself. Here, director Panos Cosmatos plunges Cage into a phantasmagorical revenge horror – part giallo, part S&M nightmare. He plays lumberjack Red, living in rural bliss with artist partner Mandy (Andrea Riseborough), until a messianic cult turns up and its leader, Linus Roache’s Jeremiah, takes a shine to her. An exercise in extreme gothic style, it’s gory and gobsmacking, with a near-silent Cage at the top of his psychotic game.Saturday 16 April, 12.45am, Film4 Gillian Wallace Horvat’s gleeful mockumentary is part satire on cinematic authenticity and part Lady Vengeance-tinged horror. After being told she’d make a good murderer, struggling but overly self-confident Los Angeles indie film-maker Gillian (Wallace Horvat) documents herself putting the theory into practice, step by ever more bloody step. You can see all this as a metaphor for the cut-throat nature of the movie business, but it’s also a glorious black comedy about finding your calling and really going for it.Saturday 16 April, 11pm, Film4 It’s the Easter holidays, so how do you entertain the kids? Hakuna matata, folks – there’s always a Disney animation to watch, and this 1994 movie is one of their best. The story of young lion Simba and his quest to avenge his father’s murder has the ring of Greek tragedy about it (and even a touch of Hamlet), but it’s a much more light-hearted family affair. Plus, there are songs by Elton John and Tim Rice and vivid supporting animals – special mention must go to Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella as meerkat/warthog double act Timon and Pumbaa.Sunday 17 April, 5.45pm, BBC One Nicole Kidman is the headmistress of a girls’ school in civil war-hit Virginia who decides to nurse Colin Farrell’s injured Union soldier back to health after he is found nearby. Soon, he begins to work his charms on her charges – in particular on Kirsten Dunst’s naive teacher. Clint Eastwood’s 1971 dark melodrama is a film ripe for a less macho remake, and Sofia Coppola’s 2017 take makes her female characters more three-dimensional while retaining the original’s hazy atmosphere of sexual attraction and jealousy.Sunday 17 April, 11.25pm, BBC One Candyman director Nia DaCosta’s debut feature is a compellingly acted, messily human drama about the hard choices poor people – and often poor women – have to make to survive. Tessa Thompson stars as the resourceful Ollie, nearing the end of her probation for smuggling prescription drugs from Canada to the US but facing eviction from the family home. Her sister Deb (Lily James) is flakier, a single mother living in a trailer whose unexpected pregnancy drags Ollie into an illegal, and increasingly dangerous, race against time to find the cash to save the house.Sunday 17 April, 11.05pm, AMC Astoundingly mercenary it may be, but Christopher Miller and Phil Lord’s product placement-heavy animated comedy is undeniably enjoyable. Chris Pratt adds an air of friendly befuddlement to a caper that riffs shamelessly off the Matrix and uses the limitations of the titular toy bricks for much of its humour. In a highly regulated Lego world, Pratt’s nondescript builder, Emmet, is chosen as “the Special”, a leader who it is prophesied will free everyone from the evil Lord Business (Will Ferrell). In this task he is aided by Elizabeth Banks’s Wildstyle and Will Arnett’s scene-stealing Batman.Monday 18 April, 6pm, Sky Showcase A band of plucky, if mismatched, Brits join forces to break an unbreakable Nazi code and turn the tide of the second world war. So far, so generic, but Morten Tyldum’s gripping thriller is also the tragic true story of Alan Turing, the brilliant, gay mathematician who invented the computer that cracked the Enigma machine but whose conviction for “gross indecency” led to his suicide in 1954. Benedict Cumberbatch is affecting as Turing, while Keira Knightley brings her usual intelligence and pep to Joan Clarke, who defied the misogyny of the age to play her part.Friday 22 Aril, 10.40pm, BBC One ",Arts/Television & radio,Mandy to I Blame Society: the seven best films to watch on TV this week,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/15/mandy-to-i-blame-society-the-seven-best-films-to-watch-on-tv-this-week
4/15/2022,"Joe Root has resigned as the England men’s Test captain after a five-year tenure in the role. Pressure had built on the 31-year-old after a dire run of Test results, culminating in a 4-0 Ashes thrashing and subsequent 1-0 series defeat in West Indies. Root holds the record for the highest number of wins as England men’s Test captain, his 27 putting him one ahead of Michael Vaughan and three ahead of Sir Alastair Cook and Sir Andrew Strauss. But the past 12 months have been dismal. After winning their opening three Tests of 2021, England have won just one since, losing 11 and drawing five of their last 17. “After returning from the Caribbean tour and having time to reflect, I have decided to step down,” said Root. “It has been the most challenging decision I have had to make in my career but having discussed this with my family and those closest to me; I know the timing is right. “I am immensely proud to have captained my country and will look back on the past five years with enormous pride. It has been an honour to have done the job and to have been a custodian of what is the pinnacle of English cricket. I have loved leading my country, but recently it’s hit home how much of a toll it has taken on me and the impact it has had on me away from the game. “I want to take this opportunity to thank my family, who have lived it all with me and been incredible pillars of love and support throughout. All of the players, coaches and support staff that have helped me during my tenure. It has been a great privilege to have been with them on this journey. I would also like to thank all the England supporters for their unwavering support. We are lucky to have the best fans in the world, and wherever we play, that positivity is something we always cherish and admire, which is a huge drive for all of us out there. “I am excited to continue representing the [team] and producing performances that will enable the team to succeed. I look forward to helping the next captain, my teammates and coaches in whatever way I can.” The ECB chief executive Tom Harrison said: “Joe has been an exceptional role model during his tenure, balancing the demands of Test captaincy whilst continuing to shine brilliantly through his own personal performances. He has led by example, and that has resulted in more Test wins than any other England captain, alongside a number of famous series home and away victories. “Joe’s leadership qualities were exemplified by how he led the team through some of the most difficult and uncertain times we have known, playing during the pandemic all over the world, which speaks volumes for him as a leader and as a person.” More details to follow …",Sport/Sport,Joe Root resigns as England Test cricket captain after torrid run,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/15/joe-root-resigns-as-england-test-cricket-captain-after-torrid-run
4/15/2022,"Over the past decade, the prolific and versatile British saxophonist/composer Trish Clowes has written for ensembles as substantial as the London Sinfonietta and the BBC Concert Orchestra. But since 2016, probably her favourite setting has been her eloquent and reflexive small jazz band, the My Iris quartet. Guitarist Chris Montague, keyboardist Ross Stanley and drummer James Maddren join Clowes on her seventh album, A View with a Room: a rich mix of cinematic landscape evocation, funky guitar grooves, dreamy reveries spun off minimalist patterns and fluently uncliched improv. Clowes wrote all but one of these eight instrumentals for her live-streamed lockdown shows, and the isolation, loss, and sporadic creative consolations of that period inevitably influence their themes. The clock-like snare smack under the title track suggest lockdown’s monotony, while the asymmetrical suppleness of Clowes’s full-toned tenor solo, and fluent breaks from Stanley and Montague, celebrate a free creativity within it. The Ness, a heartfelt tribute to film-maker Rose Hendry’s impressions of the Fife coastline, also evocatively juxtaposes moods, in the stuttery minimalism of Montague’s five-note guitar pattern under Clowes’s smoky murmurs on tenor, and her dreamy, misty-landscape sounds on soprano. Montague’s chords get a hauntingly Bill Frisellian country chime on the seductively waltzing Time, while Clowes’s expressive power at low volumes drives twisting tenor variations on the same track. A View with a Room vividly confirms that Clowes’s ever-adroit balancing of structure and eclectic postbop improv with My Iris seems to be improving with every album. Norwegian piano star Tord Gustavsen’s long-honed recipe of low-key folk songs, gospel, classical music and jazz gets a graceful makeover on Opening (ECM) – with new bassist Steinar Raknes, a player of uncannily responsive precision alongside regular percussionist Jarle Vespestad, while subtle electronics sometimes create ghostly horn-player effects. That inimitable vocalist, composer, MC and sound-painter Cleveland Watkiss puts his unique stamp on Jamaican musical history with The Great Jamaican Songbook Vol 1 (Cdubya Music) – gracefully buoyant on Gregory Isaacs’ If I Don’t Have You; coolly cruising in a pumping jazz band including trumpeter Byron Wallen and vibraphonist Orphy Robinson on Burning Spear’s Red, Gold and Green. And innovative New York composer/saxist Tim Berne, as you may never have heard him before, plays his own compositions in flintily lyrical and welcomingly warm duo partnership with young rising-star guitar original Gregg Belisle-Chi (Mars, Intakt Records).",Arts/Music,Trish Clowes: A View With a Room review – a dreamy mix of structure and eclectic improv,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/15/trish-clowes-a-view-with-a-room-review
