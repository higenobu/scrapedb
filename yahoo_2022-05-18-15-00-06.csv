5/18/2022,"Former Trump advisor Fiona Hill recalled her encounter with Vladimir Putin over dinner. She observed that Putin smelled ""like he had stepped out of some special preparatory bath."" She claimed that Putin never ate or drank at dinner, and used cards with huge words on them. Fiona Hill, an advisor on Russia under former President Donald Trump, has described what it was like sitting next to Russian President Vladimir Putin at dinner, including the odd smell he exuded. Hill made the remarks while speaking on BBC Sounds' ""Desert Island Discs"" program, during which she recounted her experience being seated within touching distance of the Russian leader. ""I took in the suits, one of the finely tailored suits, the way that the little vein pulses on the left-hand side of his face,"" Hill said on the episode, which aired on May 8. Besides noticing Putin's ""very expensive watch,"" Hill also observed that the Russian leader ""really could have done with glasses"" because he used cards with huge words on them. ""I could read them all, cards telling him who was who and what he should say and things like this,"" she recalled. Hill also observed that Putin ""didn't eat or drink anything"" during the meal. Above all, however, Hill also said she took note of the Russian leader's smell. ""Now, this sounds really bizarre, but I could smell that he was freshly laundered. He wasn't wearing cologne, but it was almost like he had stepped out of some special preparatory bath or something, into the moment,"" Hill said. She added that Putin appeared to be ""all in command"" of the image he projected in front of others. ""I thought: 'Wow, look at this,'"" Hill said. ""All of this is staged. Every little element of this is staged. This is a performance."" She said Putin was also ""not much of a conversationalist"" and that he ""barely gave her a glance"" throughout the meal. Hill is best known for having served in the Trump administration as an advisor on Russia. In recent months, she has weighed in on multiple occasions about the former president's interactions with Putin. In November, Hill said that she thought Trump envied Putin because he wanted to rule the US ""as he pleases."" In January and February, Hill also voiced her views on Russia's then-brewing invasion of Ukraine, saying that Trump likely emboldened Putin during his term, and made the US look weak to Russia. In April, Hill claimed that Trump began to resemble Putin during his time as president, in terms of ""political practice and predilection.""

5/18/2022,"Twitter said on Tuesday it plans to complete its $44 billion merger agreement with Elon Musk. This is despite Musk's apparent hesitation in recent days to go ahead with negotiations. Both parties had agreed to rules that ensure the deal closes, including a clause that forces a completion. Twitter said it plans to complete its $44 billion merger agreement with Elon Musk, even as the Tesla CEO appears to dither on the deal. ""Twitter is committed to completing the transaction on the agreed price and terms as promptly as practicable,"" it said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing published Tuesday night, referring to Musk's offer to take the company private. ""We intend to close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement,"" the board also told Bloomberg in a statement. A Twitter spokesperson declined to comment when approached by Insider. On Tuesday, Musk put the brakes on negotiations, saying the buyout can't proceed unless Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal proved that the platform has fewer than 5% fake accounts. Earlier that day Agrawal had said that ""we aren't perfect at catching spam."" Musk also suggested a day earlier that he could renegotiate the deal at a lower price, Bloomberg reported. In response, Twitter on Tuesday evening published its account of how the deal was negotiated over several weeks with Musk. Twitter suggested that Musk did not make obvious efforts in finding out more about Twitter's business, including the number of spam accounts on its platform, before offering to take Twitter private on April 25. Twitter and Musk set out terms and conditions last month to ensure that both parties stick to closing the buyout deal, which is expected to end in October. Each side agreed to pay the other party a $1 billion penalty if they don't honor the agreement. Should negotiations look shaky, Twitter could also enact a ""specific performance"" clause to force Musk — through a lawsuit — to close the deal if there's already financing in place and all conditions are met. The company's Tuesday filing raised the prospect that it could sue Musk and obtain a settlement from him, Reuters reported. Twitter's falling share price suggested that investors were convinced that Musk's current buyout offer might fall through. It closed at $38.32 on Tuesday, almost 30% lower than Musk's offer at $54.20 per share.

Contact a qualified medical professional before engaging in any physical activity, or making any changes to your diet, medication or lifestyle. Lupus is a serious and debilitating disease that's not only hard to diagnose and difficult to live with, but a challenge to treat. Many of the debilitating and troublesome symptoms can't be seen — such as fatigue and joint pain — leaving those living with lupus feeling isolated and misunderstood. The Lupus Foundation of America estimates that at least five million people worldwide are living with a form of lupus. Many celebrities, such as Paula Abdul, Lady Gaga and Selena Gomez, have been diagnosed with the condition and use their platform to educate fans about the disease. ""As many of you know, around a year ago I revealed that I have lupus, an illness that can affect people in different ways,"" Gomez told People in 2019. ""I’ve discovered that anxiety, panic attacks and depression can be side effects of lupus, which can present their own challenges. It's an everyday struggle."" May is Lupus Awareness Month, which aims to generate awareness of the chronic disease amongst the general public and medical community. Like many other life-threatening conditions, it's important to know the early warning signs so that patients may begin battling it early on. Lupus is an autoimmune disease that occurs when your body's immune system attacks your own tissues and organs. ""Inflammation caused by lupus can affect many different body systems, including your joints, blood cells, lungs, heart, skin and kidneys,"" Sandra Evans, a retired rheumatologist specializing in lupus, tells Yahoo Canada. ""It can be difficult to diagnose because its symptoms often mimic other conditions."" Although the cause of lupus remains unknown, Evans explains that genetics, epigenetics, infections, viruses, certain medications and environmental factors play a role. ""Further study will strengthen our understanding of the causes of lupus, which should lead to improved diagnosis, treatment and prevention,"" says Evans. While anyone can get lupus, the condition mostly affects women between the ages of 15 and 44. ""Approximately nine out of 10 adults with the disease are women,"" Evans explains. ""It’s also more common in women of Hispanic, Native American, Asian and African American descent than in Caucasian women."" Recent research suggests that people who have a family member with lupus or another autoimmune disease may be more at risk, but it's likely that a combination of factors trigger the condition. No two cases of lupus are exactly alike, which makes the disease difficult to diagnose. Symptoms may develop slowly or come on suddenly, and may be or mild or severe. ""Most people living with lupus also have 'flares,' where symptoms get worse for a period of time, then improve or even disappear entirely,"" says Evans. The most distinctive sign of lupus — a facial rash that resembles butterfly wings across both cheeks — occurs in many but not all cases. Other symptoms include join pain and stiffness, fever, fatigue, anxiety, shortness of breath, dry eyes, headaches, chest pain and skin lesions. ""No single test can diagnose lupus, and it could take months or even years to really be sure. But usually, blood and urine tests, a physical exam and skin biopsies are used to make a diagnosis,"" adds Evans. If you or a loved one has symptoms of lupus, it's important to make an appointment to see a doctor. Treatment can depend on the severity of your symptoms. Once you're diagnosed, your physician will refer you to a rheumatologist who treats symptoms like joint pain and fatigue. ""Your rheumatologist will develop a personalized treatment plan that will help you prevent or treat flares, balance hormones, strengthen the immune system and reduce pain,"" says Evans. ""You may also get referred to a dermatologist to treat skin issues or a nephrologist if your kidneys are affected."" If you have lupus, you'll likely have a range of feelings about your condition, from worry and fear to extreme frustration. The challenges of living with the disease can increase your risk of mental health problems such as stress, anxiety and low self-esteem. To help cope, Evans suggests to connect with others who have lupus, gather support among friends and family, and make time for self-care. There is no single way to prevent lupus, but knowing what causes the disease can help you prevent certain symptoms. ""I would recommend limiting your time in direct sunlight, avoid overusing medications if possible, get enough sleep and develop stress management techniques,"" suggests Evans. ""As with everyone, it's important to exercise regularly, drink lots of water, and eat a healthy diet to prevent viruses or infections that can lead to the development of lupus.""

Carrie Ann Inaba is a regular on-screen personality known best for her role as a judge on Dancing With The Stars and her stint as a co-host on The Talk. But while she's a pro when it comes to putting a big smile on for the camera, she's opening up about the pain that she's suffered behind the cameras.
The 54-year-old host and dancer tells Yahoo Life that she's long ""defined myself through physical wellness,"" as a result of her lifelong dance practice. ""I was an athlete, I could move, I was fit. I was all of these things."" When she began to feel physical and chronic pain while judging her fourth season of DWTS, however, she felt in conflict with her identity.
Today, Inaba is outspoken about living with numerous autoimmune diseases including lupus, fibromyalgia and Sjogren's syndrome — the source of her painful symptoms — and accepts them as a part of her wellness journey. Just years ago, she was suffering in silence.
""I started experiencing all these symptoms. Symptoms that people couldn't see and wouldn't believe because I would show up on camera with full hair and makeup and look presentable. And that became very, very difficult to live that way,"" she says. ""I felt a lot of shame, you know, when you're presenting one thing but there's another reality. And I had to surrender up the idea that I was a fit dancer, and that was my identity.""",Health/Yahoo Canada Style,Selena Gomez calls lupus an 'everyday struggle': What are the signs and symptoms?,https://news.yahoo.com/selena-gomez-lupus-awareness-month-125648535.html

He even started the hashtag #WhenSnoopBuysTwitter to chronicle his list of ideas.
