Andrew Pugh, 52, a father-of-three from Worcester, Worcestershire, admitted he thought he was “being the hero” for avoiding a COVID-19 vaccine. But he later became so ill his family were told by hospital staff he had a 50/50 chance of survival.

Speaking from his hospital bed at Worcestershire Royal Hospital, where he spent three weeks in the ICU, Mr Pugh said: “I didn't get the vaccine, I thought I was being the hero. ""If it wasn't for the nurses and the fact I'm a non-smoker I wouldn't be alive - they saved my life. ""I want to say thank you to the staff in the ICU for giving me my second chance, it has been hard and it still is. ""Please people get your vaccinations, you don't want to end up like me. ""When you're dead and all your family are heartbroken you can't turn around and say 'I wish I had the vaccine'. ""This is very real and people need to get their jabs."" Mr Pugh has been moved from intensive care on to a ward but remains on oxygen. He was admitted to hospital on 5 December and was only allowed one visitor to spend an hour with him on Christmas Day. His niece, Sophie Pugh, organised a collection for the staff on the intensive care unit as a thank you for their work. She said: ""We managed 16 bags, three boxes, bottles of water and juice plus a few vouchers.

""To say they were shocked was an understatement, thank you to every single person that helped make this happen."" According to the government’s latest figures, more than 51.8 million people in the UK have had a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and more than 47.4 million have had two doses. More than 34.2 million people have had a booster or a third dose. Watch: Do coronavirus vaccines affect fertility? Social media is awash with unsubstantiated claims the coronavirus vaccines being rolled out across the UK may affect an individual's hopes of becoming a parent down the line.The jabs cause the body to think it has been infected with the coronavirus’ spike protein, which the pathogen uses to enter cells. The body then launches an immune response against the spike protein, helping to ward off severe disease if the coronavirus were to be encountered.Some mistakenly believe the spike protein is similar to syncytin-1, a protein involved in the placenta’s development. The unsubstantiated rumours then say launching an immune response against the spike protein will affect syncytin-1, impacting the placenta and ultimately a woman’s fertility.In reality, these proteins are not similar, with there being no evidence or even biological plausibility to support the coronavirus vaccines impacting any aspect of fertility – whether it be the egg, sperm, fertilisation or implantation of an embryo into the uterus.Professor Jonathan Van Tam, England’s deputy chief medical officer, has even called these infertility theories “nonsense”.",News/Yahoo News UK,"Anti-vaxxer, 52, begs people to 'get their jabs' after fighting for life over Christmas",https://news.yahoo.com/anti-vaxxer-52-begs-people-to-get-their-jabs-after-almost-dying-over-christmas-135824327.html
1/5/2022,"The public feud between Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Dan Crenshaw is getting ugly. The Trump-loving Republican lawmakers were at each others throats on Monday, with Crenshaw suggesting Greene is either “a Democrat — or just an idiot,” and Greene firing back that Crenshaw is “harassing” her. The two members’ recent disagreement stemmed from remarks Crenshaw made during a Fox News appearance in which he advocated for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to step in and operate Covid-19 testing sites, which it did during the Trump administration. The U.S. has recently reported record numbers of people infected with the virus, leading to rapidly increasing hospitalizations and overwhelmed emergency rooms. More from Rolling Stone Peter Navarro: Trump Distributed Bogus Election Fraud Research to 'Every' Congressional Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene Says She's Now Been Suspended From Facebook for 24 Hours The Walls Are Closing in Around Trump's Family in Fraud Investigation Greene, who has frequently shared vaccine disinformation and incurred multiple fines for refusing to wear a mask on the House floor, said that FEMA-run testing is unnecessary “to check for Omicron sneezes, coughs and runny noses,” downplaying the threat the virus poses — especially to the unvaccinated — with its increased transmissibility. Twitter banned Greene on Sunday, citing “repeated violations” of its “COVID-19 misinformation policy” after she tweeted a claim, without evidence, that an “extremely high amount of covid vaccine deaths are ignored and government forced vaccine mandates are increased.” A day later, Greene claimed that Facebook temporarily suspended her account for 24 hours. Before her Twitter account was shut down, Greene tweeted that Crenshaw “needs to stop calling himself conservative, he’s hurting our brand.” She also posted to her Instagram on Monday, accusing Crenshaw of skipping a vote on a Democratic-supported bill requiring public companies to disclose their commitments to environmental, social (human rights), and good governance standards. The bill passed by a one-vote margin. Responding to Greene, Crenshaw wrote on his Instagram story, “Hey Marjorie, if suggesting we should follow Trump policy instead of Biden mandates makes you mad, then you might be a Democrat — or just an idiot.” Later, he posted an image to his Instagram of Greene that he claimed was taken while Congress was voting on the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). “Isn’t this you?” Crenshaw wrote on the Instagram story, tagging Greene in the photo, which showed her seated at a table with others. “This was the moment you went for a few drinks instead of voting on the NDAA. Before bringing up missed votes, you might want to check your own record.” In a response posted to Instagram, Greene called the photo a “creepy stalking” picture and accused Crenshaw of “harassing” her to “co-sponsor his Big Tech bill.” She then claimed that instead of stopping social media censorship, the bill “actually gives more protection to online Porn companies.” “No thanks, Dan!” she added. “We need to get rid of Porn.” Greene is referring to a draft Republican bill Crenshaw supports that would reform Section 230, which grants tech companies legal immunity for content posted by third parties. Section 230 has been called “one of the most valuable tools for protecting freedom of expression and innovation on the Internet” by The Electronic Frontier Foundation. The bill Crenshaw supports would get rid of that immunity for platforms that discriminate based on “racial, sexual, political affiliation, or ethnic grounds,” a reaction to platforms’ decisions to ban accounts like Greene’s that spread misinformation. But Section 230 also protects platforms that host pornography, which is likely what Greene is alluding to here. Opponents of Section 230 have argued the law is overly broad in its protections of platforms and allows content like revenge porn and child pornography to proliferate online. Trump didn’t weigh in on the feud but later on Monday he did voice his support for Greene in a statement blasting Twitter as “a disgrace to democracy.” “Everybody should drop off of Twitter and Facebook. They’re boring, have only a Radical Left point of view, and are hated by everyone,” Trump said. “They are a disgrace to our Nation. Keep fighting, Marjorie!” This recent incident is far from the first confrontation between Greene and Crenshaw, who have been exchanging barbs since Greene entered the national spotlight. Shortly after her election in 2020, Greene accused Crenshaw of having a “loser mindset” when he said that the Republican Party should “accept the final results” of the election while adding the caveat that it “should not be partisan to suggest” an investigation into election irregularities. Crenshaw responded to Greene’s “loser” comment by telling her to “start acting like” a member of Congress, accusing her of “purposely lying” in order to “talk tough.” In December, he criticized the party’s Freedom Caucus, which claims Greene as a member. Although he did not mention specific names, he said the caucus is made of “grifters” and “performance artists.” “Performance artists are the ones who get all of the attention, the ones you think are more conservative because they know how to say slogans real well,” Crenshaw said at an event hosted by Texas Liberty Alliance PAC. “They know how to recite the lines that they know our voters want to hear.” Later that same month, Crenshaw told Politico that Greene is “not a serious person.” Best of Rolling Stone The Useful Idiots New Guide to the Most Stoned Moments of the 2020 Presidential Campaign Anatomy of a Fake News Scandal The Radical Crusade of Mike Pence",Politics/Rolling Stone,"Trouble in MAGA Land: Marjorie Taylor Greene and Dan Crenshaw Are Feuding Over Trump, Covid, and Porn",https://news.yahoo.com/trouble-maga-land-marjorie-taylor-171236144.html

1/5/2022,"The dizzying speed of omicron's spread has left Americans questioning much of what they know about Covid-19, especially on the cusp of holiday travel. ""This is hitting us at a very inopportune time,"" said Dr. Katherine Poehling, an infectious disease specialist and vaccinologist at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist in North Carolina. For full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic Though much remains unknown about omicron, experts are beginning to understand more about the variant and how it affects people who are vaccinated, unvaccinated or who have had a previous Covid infection. For example, people who are exposed to omicron appear to get sick faster and may have symptoms that are different than those of other variants. Early evidence suggests that for most people, at least for those who are up to date on their Covid vaccines, omicron appears to result in mild illness that can resemble the common cold, another form of the coronavirus. Poehling, who is also a member of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which helps guide the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s decisions on vaccines, said there appear to be prominent symptoms from omicron: Cough Fatigue or tiredness Congestion and runny nose Unlike in previous variants, the loss of taste and smell seems to be uncommon, she said. But Poehling and other experts say those symptoms are based on early reports of omicron cases, not scientific studies. ""Anecdotal reports represent just one person,"" said Dr. Bruce Y. Lee, a professor of health policy and management at the City University of New York School of Public Health. ""We have to take them with a grain of salt."" What's more, they may only reflect certain segments of the population: young and otherwise healthy, as well as those who are fully vaccinated. ""It is clear that if you're vaccinated, particularly if you’ve had a booster, omicron tends to produce milder infections,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. ""What we haven't seen yet is a substantial body of information about what omicron will do in unvaccinated people,"" he added. Indeed, at least one person who was not vaccinated is reported to have died of omicron. Officials in Houston announced Monday that the unvaccinated man in his 50s succumbed to the virus. For people who have been vaccinated, but have not had a booster, typical symptoms include more coughing, more fever and more fatigue than those who have received an extra dose, said Dr. Craig Spencer, director of global health in emergency medicine at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. There is also emerging evidence that omicron tends not to burrow deep into the lungs as much as previous variants. A study, which was posted online by the University of Hong Kong and not yet peer-reviewed, found that while omicron is less severe in the lungs, it can replicate faster higher up in the respiratory tract. In this way, omicron may act more like bronchitis than pneumonia, said Dr. Hugh Cassiere, director of critical care services for Sandra Atlas Bass Heart Hospital at the North Shore University Hospital, on Long Island, New York. ""Usually patients with acute bronchitis tend not to be short of breath. They tend to cough and produce sputum,"" he said. ""Patients with pneumonia tend to be short of breath and feel more fatigued than bronchitis in general."" A small study from the CDC found that people who had Covid and are later reinfected with omicron may experience fewer symptoms than they did during their initial bout with the virus. Still, it's virtually impossible for people to rely on symptoms to self-diagnose an illness. In addition to omicron, the delta variant continues to circulate, along with increasing cases of the flu. For these reasons, doctors urge people who have any cold symptoms or flulike symptoms to get tested. According to early data, the time it takes for an infected person to develop symptoms after an exposure may be shorter for omicron than for previous variants — from a full week down to as little as three days or fewer. While much more research is needed, it makes scientific sense that a highly contagious virus like the omicron variant would have a shorter incubation period. Its goal, after all, is to infect as many people as possible, as quickly as possible. ""That's why the spread is occurring at a much faster pace,"" said Dr. Anita Gupta, an anesthesiologist and critical care physician at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. She added that it's possible the incubation period could be shorter or longer depending on a number of variables, including age, underlying health problems and vaccination status. ""There is no hard and fast rule here."" Given the potential for a shorter incubation period, Vanderbilt's Schaffner advised that anyone who has been in contact with an infected individual get tested about 72 hours following the exposure. ""If you've been exposed and now you're asking yourself, 'When should I get tested?' I think you would best wait at least three days to see if you've turned positive,"" he said. For the millions of people without any known Covid exposure, but who are getting together with friends and family over the Christmas holiday, Schaffner said, it would be prudent to get a rapid test the day of the gathering. Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to President Joe Biden, agreed. ""By all means, go the extra step, go the extra mile to get tested"" to alleviate any concerns about gatherings, he said on NBC's ""TODAY"" show Tuesday. ""But if you don't have the availability of the test and you are fully vaccinated and boosted, you should feel comfortable having a holiday meal or gathering with family members who are also vaccinated and boosted,"" Fauci said. Though much remains unknown about omicron, experts say the variant could lead to long Covid, even with a mild case. Patients with long-term symptoms can experience crushing fatigue, irregular heart rhythms and other issues months after their initial Covid infection. This occurred during the first wave of the pandemic, and has continued to lead to long Covid issues through the delta wave. ""We should assume that this variant can do the same thing that previous variants have until proven otherwise,"" Lee, of CUNY, said. Previous research, however, suggests that vaccination can greatly reduce the risk for long Covid. Cases of omicron are doubling about every two days. In the past week, the percentage of omicron cases in the United States rose from 13 percent to 73 percent. ""The major question for everyone right now isn't whether omicron is going to hit their area. It will,"" said Dr. Michael Saag, an infectious disease expert and associate dean for global health at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. ""The question,"" he said, ""is how much disease will it cause?"" Experts continue to urge people to get vaccinated and get a booster shot to reduce the risk for severe illness. As of Tuesday, about 61 percent of the population had been fully vaccinated. Just under 30 percent had the booster shot. ""This is going to hit us hard,"" Poehling, of Wake Forest Baptist, said. But she added that the sheer speed of omicron's spread could mean that the variant will run its course quickly. ""If you look at South Africa, they seem to be doing much better now. I don't anticipate this as long lasting.""

1/5/2022,"NEW YORK (AP) — A judge was mostly dismissive Tuesday of oral arguments by a lawyer for Prince Andrew who wants to win a fast dismissal of a lawsuit alleging that the prince sexually assaulted an American woman when she was 17. U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan did not immediately rule at the end of a video conference, but he made it clear that he was not leaning Andrew’s way as he rejected much of the reasoning offered by the prince's attorney, Andrew Brettler, who said the case “should absolutely be dismissed.” “I appreciate the arguments and the passion. You’ll have the decision pretty soon,” Kaplan told lawyers. The judge directed that the exchange of potential evidence in the case was to proceed as scheduled. The oral arguments followed written submissions made weeks ago in the case brought by Virginia Giuffre, a woman who alleged in her August lawsuit that the prince sexually assaulted her multiple times in 2001 after she was introduced to him by financier Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Attorney David Boies, representing Giuffre, argued against dismissal of the lawsuit. Epstein, 66, killed himself in a Manhattan federal jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting a sex trafficking trial, while Maxwell, 60, was convicted last week of sex trafficking and conspiracy charges in federal court in New York. The prince has strenuously denied the allegations in Giuffre's lawsuit. During much of a hearing that lasted over an hour, Brettler argued that the wording of a 2009 settlement agreement between Epstein and Giuffre that resulted in a $500,000 payment to Giuffre protects the prince from being sued by her. The agreement was unsealed and became publicly available on Monday. The judge repeatedly disagreed with Brettler's argument that wording in the agreement about “potential defendants” being protected from being sued by Giuffre would prevent her from suing the prince. Kaplan noted that there could be many interpretations of what constituted a potential defendant, and that the only parties who would know exactly what was intended were Giuffre and Epstein. “This is an example where the word ‘potential’ is the use of a word to which you or I cannot find any meaning at all,” the judge said. He also noted that the sealing of the terms of the settlement deal for a dozen years meant that anyone the parties might have intended to be protected against future lawsuits by Giuffre would never have known, since they couldn't see it. The judge also appeared dismissive of other claims by Brettler, including that it was unconstitutional for New York's governor to permit the temporary changing of a New York state law to allow lawsuits pertaining to sex abuse from decades ago to be filed. And he also rejected arguments that the claims Giuffre made were too vague. He read a portion of the lawsuit in which Giuffre alleged “involuntary sexual intercourse.” “There isn't any doubt what that means,” the judge said.",U.S./Associated Press,Prince Andrew effort to toss sex assault suit hits roadblock,https://news.yahoo.com/prince-andrew-effort-toss-sex-165822776.html
1/5/2022,"Halfway along on my bike ride I spied a banner high up a flagpole: six-inch-high letters spelling out, “Let’s go, Brandon,” red and white on a blue background. I was sure that it was new, since I frequently pass this particular house with the circular driveway and there was no flag before. The sentence – or imprecation, as most people know by now – is code for “(Expletive) Joe Biden,” which is what a crowd was chanting during a NASCAR race, but what an NBC Sports reporter misheard as cheers for the race winner, Brandon Brown. The morning of the following day, when I was passing the same house, a man was exiting a car in the curving driveway. Why not, I thought. “Hey, bud,” I said. He turned, smiled and said, “How ya doing?” He appeared to be in his 50s, heavyset with a short, military-style haircut. Possibly a former offensive lineman in college or high school. “I wanted to ask about your flag,” I said. “Sure,” he said as he looked up at the flag and chuckled. I asked him if he really meant to display it at Christmas, the season of peace and goodwill. “I don’t know,” he said, smiling. “Yeah, I guess.” Although the obscenity was directed at the president, I asked the man, wasn't it also an attack against, at least, half the population? The man's smile was now gone. “Well,” he said, “we’re coming back anyway,” By which, I assumed, he meant that former President Donald Trump was coming back. I rode home and I told my wife, Marianne, about my conversation. She said that I had wasted my time. “I wanted to give him something to think about,” I told her. But the following morning – when the flag was still flying – Marianne’s contention that such people are immutable appeared to be right. Which got me thinking: Maybe I needed to change my behavior. Maybe for New Year’s, I needed a resolution for dealing with politically and profanely recalcitrant people. Previously I deemed it a responsibility to confront anti-vaxxers, climate change deniers, immigration opponents, Jan. 6th insurrectionists and voter suppression advocates – to compel them to see the illogical or nonfactual basis of their views. And so I have tried, both in newspaper columns and in person. But Marianne’s claim that it’s a waste of ink and/or breath on closed minds has been borne out. Several friends and relatives, with whom I used to have normal conversations, now eschew and ignore fact checking. One person even said that in matters such as the coronavirus, they would rather listen to Trump than to Dr. Anthony Fauci. Therefore, I resolve in 2022 to fight fire with judo. I resolve to parry with the American “obstinocracy” by reversing the momentum of their thrusts back in their direction. I resolve to call them out on their manhood at every turn – since faux strength and machismo, not reason, seems to be the impetus for their views. For example, those who falsely claim that elections have been crooked say that we must have tougher voting restrictions. But their real reason is their fear of sharing democratic power with African Americans, Hispanics and Asian Americans. There are also those who fallaciously claim that critical race theory offends and harms their children – and who want parents to storm schools, threaten board members and control the curriculum. But their gut motivation is the fear that history will confirm the truth about racial injustice, giving power to the aforementioned minorities. Therefore, in 2022, when someone tells me that global warming is a natural occurrence and that we are wimps to heed alarmist scientists – all 97% of them – I will suggest that they ""man up"" and fight the calamity head on instead of fearfully burying their head in the sand. I also resolve to similarly challenge others, whether it’s homophobes with a hysterical fear of Americans in the LGBT community, white supremacists with an infantile fear of being replaced or the political office holders who betray the public good out of fear of Trump. So when I next return to the corner with the house with the circular driveway – and suggest to my neighbor that he is clearly too brave a man to hide behind a euphemism – I will let you know how it goes.
