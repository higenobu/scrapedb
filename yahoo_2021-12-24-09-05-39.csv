As for the first force — the lust for profits — this is when individual investors dump losers to create tax losses to offset gains.

12/24/2021,"Some say cash is king. But according to Ray Dalio, founder of the world’s largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, it may not be wise to keep too much of your investment money in cash these days. “Cash is not a safe investment, is not a safe place because it will be taxed by inflation,” Dalio told CNBC last month. Dalio’s concern came after U.S. inflation hit a 31-year high in October. And prices continued to climb. In November, the consumer price index rose 6.8% on a year-over-year basis, marking its fastest increase since June 1982. Simply put, consumers are taking a big hit in their purchasing power. So let’s take a look at three ways to hedge against inflation — one could be worth pouncing on with some of your extra cash. Gold is often considered the go-to safe haven asset. It can’t be printed out of thin air like fiat money, and its value is largely unaffected by economic events around the world. The yellow metal has helped investors preserve wealth for centuries. Some believe this could be another one of its shiny moments. You can buy gold coins and bars at your local bullion shop. You can also look at large gold mining companies. If gold prices go up, these miners will earn higher revenue and profits, which tend to translate into higher share prices. For instance, companies like Barrick Gold, Newmont and Freeport-McMoRan typically do well during tough times for other sectors. There’s no need to start big. These days, you can build your own diversified portfolio just by using your leftover digital nickels and dimes. Once considered a niche asset, Bitcoin has entered the main stage. One reason people are increasingly adopting cryptocurrency is because they believe in its potential as an inflation hedge. Central banks can print money all they want, but the number of bitcoins is capped at 21 million by mathematical algorithms. Dalio recently said that Bitcoin is “almost a younger generation’s alternative to gold.” The price of Bitcoin has pulled back substantially in recent weeks, but is still up 60% year to date. If you want to buy Bitcoin directly, be aware many exchanges charge up to 4% in commission fees just to buy and sell crypto. A few investing apps charge 0%. Investors can also gain exposure through companies that have tied themselves to the crypto market. For instance, software technologist MicroStrategy has built a stash of 122,478 bitcoins. Electric vehicle giant Tesla holds around 43,200 bitcoins. Then there are pick-and-shovel plays like Coinbase Global, which runs the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S. It’s true that these companies are all quite pricey, trading at between $238 and $899 per share. But you could get a smaller piece of Tesla or Coinbase by using an app that allows you to buy fractions of shares with as much money as you are willing to spend. Stocks are volatile, cryptos make big swings to either side, and even gold is not immune to the market’s ups and downs. That’s why if you are looking for the ultimate hedge, it could be worthwhile to check out a real, but overlooked asset: fine art. Contemporary artwork has outperformed the S&P 500 by a commanding 174% over the past 25 years, according to the Citi Global Art Market chart. And it’s becoming a popular way to diversify because it’s a real physical asset with little correlation to the stock market. On a scale of -1 to +1, with 0 representing no link at all, Citi found the correlation between contemporary art and the S&P 500 was just 0.12 during the past 25 years. Earlier this year, Bank of America investment chief Michael Harnett singled out artwork as a sharp way to outperform over the next decade — due largely to the asset’s track record as an inflation hedge. Investing in art by the likes of Banksy and Andy Warhol used to be an option only for the ultrarich, like Dalio. But with a new investing platform, you can invest in iconic artworks just like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates do. This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

12/24/2021,"When stocks fall in price, it’s frequently a signal for renewed investor interest. After all, low share prices offer a chance to live up to the old market advice, ‘buy low and sell high.’ What investors need is some way to tell the underlying reasons for a drop in share price, whether it bodes well or ill for the stock. One of the best stock signals comes from corporate insiders, the company officers who hold positions of high responsibility – to their Boards, and to their peers, and to their shareholders and customers – for bringing in the maximum returns. Their main focus is on keeping the company healthy, and their positions give them access to knowledge that the general public just hasn’t got. And that knowledge will inform their trading decisions when they trade their company’s stock. Investors should keep on the lookout for informative trades by the insiders, both buys and sells, especially when the stock looks beaten down. Just because a company’s shares have slipped in price doesn’t necessarily mean that the stock is unsound, or should be avoided as an investment – and the insiders are in the best place to know that for certain. So, when retail investors see insiders buying large in a stock that’s trading at a low point, that’s a signal to heed. We’ll heed that signal. Using the TipRanks Insiders’ Hot Stocks tool, we’ve looked up two stocks that show the combination of a beaten down price, a Strong Buy consensus rating from the analyst community, plenty of upside potential, and recent informative buys from the insiders. Here are the details. Remitly Global (RELY) We’ll look first at Remitly Global, a financial services company specializing in facilitating international transfer payments. Remitly ensures security for both sender and receiver, allowing for safe and accurate transactions. It’s an essential niche in a global economy where international remittance payments from immigrants and migrant workers are big business. Remitly bases its operations on a mobile app, allowing users to conduct transactions via smartphone for lower fees than banks offer. Remitly went public in late September, with an IPO that saw 12 million shares hit the market at $43 each, slightly above the expected initial pricing range of $38 to $42. The company raised almost $523 million in gross capital, and seemed poised to jump – but the stock has since fallen about 60%. The fall in share price has come even as the company reported solid results in its first public quarterly financial report. Revenue grew 69% yoy, to reach $121.2 million, growth that was driven by increases in the customer base and the average revenue per customer. On the first, Remitly saw its active customers grow 51% yoy to 2.6 million, and on the second, customers are spending more through the app. Remitly reported that average revenue per customer was up 12% from the year-ago quarter. The volume of funds sent through the system grew 61%, to $5.2 billion for the quarter. On the negative side, Remitly is the upstart in the remittance industry, and while its mobile application is novel, it faces an uphill battle against established players like Western Union and MoneyGram. These companies have known reputations and commanding advantages in market share; their weakness is a dependence on in-person services, a drawback in the ‘corona era’ which Remitly’s mobile app bypasses. On the insider trading, sentiment is positive, pushed by two officers who have made large, recent purchases. The first, William Kazuo Bryant, serves on the Board of Directors and in two purchases this month he picked up 12,800 shares, spending over $245,000 on the stock. The second purchaser was Matthew Oppenheimer, the President and CEO of Remitly. He spent $244,470 on 13,750 shares of company stock. This stock has caught the attention of JPMorgan's 5-star analyst Tien-tsin Huang, who says of RELY, “We believe shares are oversold and misunderstood. We see RELY as a sustainable 30+% revenue grower in providing digital remittances to immigrants, taking share from legacy providers from a position of strength in terms of pricing and customer trust with upside potential from new products and partners (including crypto).” Huang’s comments back his Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating, and he sets a $57 price target which implies an impressive upside of 189% for the next 12 months. (To watch Huang’s track record, click here) It’s clear that Wall Street hasn’t panicked on RELY shares, and is in agreement with the JPMorgan view – the stock has 8 recent reviews, and they are all positive, giving a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target of $47 suggests a one-year upside of 139% from the current trading price of $19.66. (See RELY stock analysis on TipRanks) HealthEquity (HQY) Next up is HealthEquity, a leader in the field of health savings account administration. This company has an IRS designation as a non-bank health savings trustee, making it eligible to manage health savings accounts regardless of the institution in which the funds are deposited. Healthcare is a growing sector of the economy, and health savings accounts are an increasingly popular way of sequestering funds to cover costs, giving HealthEquity a strong niche for the business. The company works with employers, health plans, and benefit advisors to create savings programs for end users. HealthEquity shares have dropped sharply after the Dec 6 release of the fiscal 3Q22 results. The stock is now down 52% from the peak it reached in late January. At first glance, this may prompt some questions, as the company met expectations on earnings. At 35 cents, EPS was in-line with the forecast, although it was down 14% year-over-year. The real hits came from the revenue and the forward guidance. At the top line, the company reported $180 million; this was essentially flat from the year-ago quarter. Worse, the revenue missed expectations by over $5 million. On the forward guidance, management trimmed both revenue and earnings estimates. At the top line, the company is predicting full-year fiscal 2022 revenues between $750 million and $755 million, a reduction of $7.5 million at the midpoint. On earnings, the company cut the forecast from the $1.45 to $1.50 range to a range of $1.30 to $1.35, a midpoint cut of 15 cents per share. These cuts spooked investors, prompting a selloff that saw the stock lose 24% in one day. The company officers, however, are willing to stick with HQY. Over the past 13 days, no fewer than three directors and the company President/CEO have made large, informative buys of HQY shares. Start with the Directors. Stuart Parker bought 25,000 shares, paying $1.07 million and increasing his holding to $1.23 million. Adrian Dillon spent more then $500,000 on 12,375 shares, to boost his holding to $1.78 million. And Evelyn Dilsaver made a 5,018 share purchase for just over $199,000. Her stake in the company now exceeds $990,000. The largest purchase, however, came from Jon Kessler, President and CEO. He bought up 100,000 shares for $1.4 million, and now holds a total of $14.3 million worth of company stock. Together, these purchases swung the insider sentiment on HQY strongly positive. RBC analyst Sean Dodge keeps an even strain, saying: “The downward guidance revision likely caught most people by surprise; however, the strength in the core HSA business appears to be continuing into year-end… all of the pressures impacting the guide came from the CDB side of the business, and thus should be transient... Longer-term, we remain bullish and believe the company's unmatched breadth/scale will position it to capture more share in a market with substantial growth runway ahead."" Dodge sees HQY recovering in the coming months, and rates the stock an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $70 price target. Investors stand to take home about 60% gain, should the target be met over the next 12 months. (To watch Dodge’s track record, click here) Overall, this stock gets a firm seal of approval from Wall Street, with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 8 Buys vs. 2 Holds. The stock is selling for $43.87, and the average price target of $63.67 indicates room for ~45% upside in the year ahead.

12/24/2021,"This article provides information for educational purposes. NerdWallet does not offer advisory or brokerage services, nor does it recommend specific investments, including stocks, securities or cryptocurrencies. If you leave a job or retire, you’re often encouraged to roll over your 401(k) or other workplace retirement account into an individual retirement account. That might not be the right move. Workplace plans have rules that can protect you from subpar investments and advisors who put their own interests ahead of yours. IRA investments can be more expensive, which can result in less money to spend in retirement. Workplace plans also may offer easier access to your money. IRAs typically offer many more investment options, a fact heavily emphasized by the financial services companies that want your money. Rollovers are big business — the Investment Company Institute, a trade group, reports that households transferred $463 billion from employer-sponsored plans to IRAs in 2017, the latest year for which statistics are available. But just having more investment choices isn’t necessarily better. “With a 401(k), your options are typically going to be more limited, but your options are also going to be squarely within your best interest,” says Dylan Bruce, financial services counsel for the Consumer Federation of America, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. You usually have choices about what to do with your retirement funds when you leave a job, and an IRA rollover is only one way to preserve the money’s tax-deferred status. Other ways include leaving the account where it is (your former employer must allow this if your balance is over $5,000) or rolling the money into a new employer’s retirement plan, if that plan accepts such transfers. Most workplace retirement plans are covered under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which imposes a fiduciary duty on the people and companies overseeing the plans. Fiduciaries are required to operate solely in the interests of the participants and avoid conflicts of interest. In the past, advisors weren't held to the same standard when recommending IRA rollovers, although that's changing. The U.S. Department of Labor is extending fiduciary coverage to IRA rollovers, recognizing that financial services providers often have a strong economic incentive to recommend them even when they’re not in an investor’s best interest. Bruce calls that “a very good development,” but it won’t happen overnight. Enforcement of the new rules will be rolled out in stages starting next year, Bruce says. IRAs are sometimes touted as being cheaper than 401(k)s on average, but often that’s not the case. Since 2000, the cost of equity funds inside 401(k)s has dropped substantially, according to the Investment Company Institute. The average expense ratio for stock mutual funds in the U.S. in 2020 was 1.16%, while 401(k) investors paid about one third that amount, or 0.39%, on average. Expense ratios are the annual fees charged for operating and administering the funds. Fees make a big difference in how much your nest egg can grow. Let’s say you invest $20,000 in a fund with a 1.16% expense ratio that grows an average of 8% each year. After 40 years, you’d have about $282,000. With a 0.39% fee, your balance would be nearly $376,000, or one-third more. Accessing your money can be harder with an IRA, as well. You can’t borrow money from an IRA for longer than 60 days, or it’s considered a taxable distribution. Any money you withdraw before age 59 1/2 is typically penalized as well as taxed, although the penalty is waived for certain withdrawals, such as for higher education or a first-home purchase. With 401(k)s, by contrast, you can begin withdrawing money at age 55 without penalties if you no longer work for the company offering the plan. If you transfer an old 401(k) account to a new employer’s plan, you typically can borrow up to half of your total vested balance or $50,000, whichever is less, and pay the money back over five years. Furthermore, your 401(k) is also generally protected from creditors. Protection for IRAs varies based on state law. Many people don’t want to leave money behind at their previous employer, and a rollover is a much better option than cashing out. A rollover also could be prudent if you don’t have access to a low-cost 401(k), you want to consolidate multiple retirement accounts, your investment options are too limited or the advisor recommending the rollover is a fiduciary (and willing to put that in writing). It’s essential to investigate all your options, though, before deciding an IRA rollover is the right one. This is, after all, money you hope will sustain you for many years in retirement so it’s important to choose wisely. “It's probably going to be for most folks one of the most important financial decisions of their lives,” Bruce says.
