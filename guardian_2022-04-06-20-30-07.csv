4/6/2022,"Medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has suspended its work in Cameroon’s south-west region and demanded the release of four staff members who have been detained for months, accused of helping secessionists. Two MSF staff were detained at a checkpoint in December when they were transferring a patient with gunshot wounds. Another two were held by Cameroonian gendarmerie in January. The suspension, announced on Tuesday, means MSF is no longer active in Cameroon’s anglophone regions in the west of the country, where separatists have been in conflict with the state. Its work in the north-west region was suspended in 2020. “We find ourselves in an untenable position: on the one hand our activities are required, and on the other hand those who provide the medical services run the risk of being persecuted for doing their work,” said Sylvain Groulx, operations manager for MSF in central Africa. MSF said its staff had followed all procedures when transferring the wounded patient in December but have been held in pre-trial detention and are being investigated for aiding secessionists. More than 500,000 people have been internally displaced in Cameroon’s anglophone regions during the fighting, which in recent months has included attacks on schools and health providers. Humanitarian groups have also had their work impeded by the theft of aid and restrictions imposed by armed groups. The south-west region is also experiencing a cholera outbreak, with 100 new cases recorded in the past week, the health minister announced on Wednesday. MSF, which had been helping in the response to the cholera epidemic, said it has been in talks with the authorities about its work and procedures to secure the release of the staff members but there has been no progress. “To guarantee access to medical care and essential humanitarian aid while ensuring maximum security for our teams and patients, in Cameroon as elsewhere in the world, our teams are in contact with all armed actors involved, both state and non state,” Groulx said. “This can by no means be considered as a lack of impartiality or an act of collusion with any parties to the ongoing violence in the anglophone regions.”",News/Global development,Médecins Sans Frontières suspends operations in parts of Cameroon over detained staff,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/06/medecins-sans-frontieres-suspends-operations-in-parts-of-cameroon-over-detained-staff
4/6/2022,"From the first signs of tooth decay to at-home whitening advice, we asked TePe’s dental hygiene expert Elaine Tilling to answer our most pressing dental dos and don’ts. And by gum, she delivered. Here’s everything you ever wanted to know about oral hygiene, but were too scared of the dentist to ask … Q. What’s the best thing I can do for my teeth?A. Simple: brush your teeth regularly using a fluoride toothpaste, clean between your teeth daily with floss or an interdental brush to clean those tiny spaces, and eat a balanced diet. That doesn’t mean you have to be healthier than thou – chocolate and sweets are only really bad if you graze between meals, but eating them with your meal is OK. Drinks-wise, the safest beverage is water. Q. Is coffee really that bad for my teeth?A. No. Staining is caused by deposits of hardened plaque, known as calculus, becoming stained, rather than the tooth itself. Marks left by red wine or coffee can be easily removed during a scale and polish. If you’re concerned, book a hygienist appointment. Q. What causes bad breath?A. Around 85% of bad breath comes from the head and neck, rather than the gut. It’s often caused by plaque, formed when saliva mixes with food and bacteria. Fortunately, plaque can be removed by thorough brushing and interdental brushes. Gum disease, infected sinuses and bacteria on the tongue can cause bad breath, too. Q. How can I stop grinding my teeth?A. Bruxism, AKA tooth grinding, tends to be subconscious and done in our sleep. So you can’t necessarily train yourself to stop doing it. Ask your dentist to assess the damage to your teeth and, if necessary, offer treatment or fit you with a mouth guard that will help prevent you grinding your enamel away. Q. Is it possible to repair enamel?A. Yes. Enamel is a calcified substance and tooth decay causes calcium to leach out because of the presence of acid. In the early stages, calcium in our saliva and fluoride in toothpaste can remineralise it and the body repairs itself. Chewing sugar-free gum stimulates saliva, and can help the remineralisation, too. Q. Is at-home whitening safe?A. Effective teeth whitening contains 0.2% hydrogen peroxide, which only licenced dental professionals can use. Over-the-counter whitening kits won’t be as effective, and buying online can be dangerous. Q. I’ve never cleaned between my teeth before. Is it too late?A. Never! Gum disease is preventable. And it’s all about simple, regular plaque removal. We recommend using interdental brushes or floss once a day to clean between your teeth, especially if you have veneers, implants, fillings or crowns, because there’s more to clean. Q. Is interdental brushing the same as flossing?A. Both tools do a similar job, but interdental brushes make it easier to clean those tricky spaces between our teeth – just push it through the gap and turn like a key. Generally, flossing works for patients with relatively healthy gum tissue and small spaces between the teeth. Interdental brushes are best if you have gum recession or bigger spaces. Q. Why do I get a dry mouth?A. Some medications have the side effect of reducing saliva flow, which may be worth talking to your GP about. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy can also damage saliva glands and cause a dry mouth. Q. What are the signs of tooth decay?A. Sensitivity to sweet, hot or cold foods and drinks, or tooth pain. When patients have early lesions – white spots on the teeth – this early decay is reversible. But when lesions go into the dentine, the hard bony tissue beneath the enamel, and starts to mushroom, it causes permanent damage. Q. I wear a fixed brace. How can I clean it?A. There’s no such thing as the perfect toothbrush – one size doesn’t fit all and there are always areas plaque and debris stick to – so it’s important to use interdental brushes, too. The yellow and green TePe interdental brushes are designed to fit around brackets and under wires. Use them after meals to make sure both your brace and your teeth are seriously clean. Q. Is it really worth getting an appointment with the hygienist?A. Yes. We all have areas we miss when brushing – I can look into your mouth and know if you’re left-handed or right-handed, for example. A hygienist can help you reduce the cost of future dentistry and prevent dental disease. Some patients need to be seen every three months, but people with a lower level of risk can go every two years.

4/6/2022,"Described by the Malay Mail as the country’s “undisputed national dish”, nasi lemak (which literally translates as “rich rice”) is so beloved in its homeland that one in two people questioned in a recent survey chose it as their all-time favourite breakfast, and it has inspired spin-offs from ice-cream to McDonald’s burgers. Like many such comfort foods, its charm lies in its versatility; at its simplest, nasi lemak is just a pile of fluffy, aromatic rice with a spicy sambal and crunchy garnish, all served in a banana leaf, though these days it’s often accompanied by more substantial dishes, such as rendang or fried chicken, and eaten at lunch and dinner, too. Many online column inches have been devoted to finding the best nasi lemak in Kuala Lumpur or Penang, but if you’re not fortunate enough to have a Malaysian restaurant or a hawker centre around the corner, have a go at this recipe to see why it is, in the words of Kuantan-born fan and MasterChef contestant Zaleha Kadir Olpin, Malaysia’s “most iconic dish”. This is the backbone of nasi lemak, and the recipes I try are divided between recommending basmati or jasmine for the purpose, both of them being long grains prized for their aromatic qualities. Sharon Wee, author of Growing Up in a Nonya Kitchen, prefers not to use jasmine, because “the fragrance of the rice somewhat undermines the full essence that stems from the pandan leaves and the coconut milk” that go into it. Instead, she calls for simple long-grain, which has the bonus of being cheaper, too. However, if you do have basmati or jasmine to hand already, either will work fine; I slightly prefer the fluffier texture of the former. Rather than just water, the rice is usually cooked in a mixture of coconut milk and water or, in Kadir Olpin’s case, just coconut milk; Wee explains that the more coconut you use, the more “lemak” the finished dish, so though I’ve suggested the same half-and-half ratio as her, with a spoonful of coconut cream stirred in at the end, if desired, feel free to adjust this to your taste. Wee and Kadir Olpin recommend using a rice cooker – a very common kitchen appliance in Malaysia, but less so in cultures where rice isn’t the staple carb – though they also give instructions for the absorption method, which leaves the grains pleasingly fluffy, particularly once the cooked rice has been steamed in a basket for an additional 10 minutes, as Wee suggests, to give it an especially rich flavour and texture. Norman Musa, chef, restaurateur and author of Amazing Malaysian, boils soaked rice for eight minutes, then leaves it to cook in its own steam for 15, while Ping Coombes – who, like Kadir Olpin, served her beloved nasi lemak to the MasterChef judges – brings it to a simmer and then leaves it covered for half an hour. Much as I like Wee’s rice, in particular, Musa’s method is easiest for the home cook, because there’s only one pan to wash up at the end, so I’m going with that. If you’re lucky enough to have a rice cooker, however, do of course use that instead. Bee Yinn Low, author of the popular Rasa Malaysia blog, tells readers that “pandan leaves or screwpine leaves [are] the secret ingredient” here: “highly fragrant with floral smell … a nasi lemak will not be authentic without the leaves.” Fresh and slightly soapy, pandan is one of my favourite aromatics, but sadly it’s not something commonly sold in British supermarkets. I found it in the freezer of a South-East Asian grocer, but if you have no luck, try looking for kewra water in Indian specialists and add a dash of that at the end instead. Musa and Kadir Olpin add cinnamon and, like Coombes, fresh ginger, and Musa also pops in some star anise and lemongrass. The more spices you add, the more perfumed your rice will be; I love pandan so much, however, that I’m going to leave it at that, but feel free to be bolder, if you like. The other must-have here is a sambal, which Low describes as “the soul of the dish; it brings together all the various toppings and complete the iconic dish”. Kadir Olpin explains in her book, My Rendang isn’t Crispy (a nod to her experience on MasterChef), that “in South-East Asia, sambal is the standard name for any spicy dish where blended chillies are the main ingredient”. Her version, she says, is a basic vegetarian one, missing the belacan (fermented shrimp paste) or dried anchovies found in other recipes, but otherwise fairly similar – a spice paste of chillies, shallots, onion, garlic and lemongrass, all fried in plenty of oil and flavoured with brown sugar and tangy tamarind to give a deep, mellow, sweet-and-sour accompaniment with a satisfying, but not overpowering warmth. Musa notes that such a sambal traditionally takes “hours to make. The longer you simmer, the milder it becomes. The heat will fade away, and all you can taste is the aftertaste.” Mindful of the constraints faced by the average home cook, he gives a version that takes just seven minutes – rather than the 90 for which I hang anxiously over Kadir Olpin’s – and it yields a delicious, but markedly less complex compromise. The other recipes fall somewhere in between, but all are very clear that one should fry the sambal until the oil separates out, which is something that cannot be rushed. The chillies, of course, are the most important element of any sambal: everyone uses dried, usually soaked or boiled first (I find boiling a more efficient way to soften them before blitzing them to a paste), and Kadir Olpin and Coombes both use fresh chillies, too, which, though not essential, do bring a fruitier flavour, as well as some extra colour. Alliums are also vital; shallots are more common, though you can use a red or even yellow onion, at a pinch (shallots are sweeter and milder than onions, so I’d recommend going with red, if needs must). Garlic is also common, but not mandatory. Aromatics such as ginger and lemongrass fall into the same category, though the warmth of the ginger pairs so well with the peppers that I can’t leave it out. The sweetness generally comes from sugar, often brown, sometimes coconut, and the tanginess from tamarind. Some recipes call for making your own tamarind water by soaking the pulp and squeezing it out, while others go for tamarind paste. Though the latter cuts down on work for the cook, my one piece of advice is to taste yours before use; it can be almost as brown and thin as the homemade stuff, or as thick and black as treacle, so start off small and adjust to taste. The savoury element generally comes from the aforementioned belacan, which is sold in blocks for grating – you could substitute fish sauce or a vegan equivalent, if you like, but the blocks keep for ages, so are well worth the investment. (Vegetarians might be interested to know that Coombes also adds a dash of soy sauce to hers.) Low, Coombes and Wee add tiny dried anchovies to their sambals, which gives them more body, as well as flavour, but I’d prefer to serve them separately. Note that the sambal can be made several days in advance to cut down on prep time – it keeps very well in the fridge. (You may also be interested to know that you can buy excellent sambal in jars: Lucullus and Makan Malaysia are the most widely recommended brands in a quick online poll.) The other traditional accompaniments to nasi lemak are all sorts of nice, crunchy things such as peanuts, cucumber and, most worthwhile of all in my opinion, the tiny dried anchovies sold by the bagful. Unprepossessing as they might appear, once fried to a crisp, they’re as moreish as bacon, and distinctly Malaysian. A peeled and halved boiled egg typically rounds off the dish, though fried eggs are increasingly popular. If you’d like to turn this from breakfast to feast, Coombes includes recipes for turmeric fried chicken coated in salted crisps, and a mild, creamy tiger prawn sambal, while Wee goes for a mild, fruity shrimp sambal, otak-otak (a spicy, grilled fish paste) and a chilli and shallot omelette; Low opts for squid sambal, Kadir Olpin suggests one of her rendangs, while Musa’s mother used to sell nasi lemak with anchovy sambal and long beans in a curry sauce. If it’s your first time, however, I’d recommend sticking with the below. It’s hard to beat.

Remove and discard the stalks from the dried chillies, then roughly break them up and put in a small pan of boiling water. Simmer for 15 minutes, then drain, reserving a little of the cooking water (a teaspoon or so). Meanwhile, trim and deseed the fresh chillies and peel and roughly chop the shallots, garlic and ginger. Whizz or pound the soaked dried chillies with their reserved soaking liquid to make a paste, then add the fresh chillies, shallots, garlic and ginger, break down into a puree, then crumble in the belacan. Heat the oil in a wok or small pan over a medium heat, add the paste and fry, stirring often so it doesn’t burn, until the oil separates out; add a little water if it begins to stick. Stir in a teaspoon of tamarind, a teaspoon of sugar and a good pinch of salt, adjust to taste, then turn down the heat and fry, still stirring regularly, until the oil separates again. Rinse the rice, then soak it in cold water for 20 minutes. Drain and put in a medium saucepan with the coconut milk – if there’s a big lump of cream on top, save this for later. Add salt and enough water to come up to the first joint of a finger poked in to the top of the rice. Tie the pandan leaves in a knot, so they fit the pot better, then nestle into the rice. Stir well, bring to a simmer, then cover, turn down the heat slightly and leave to cook for 10 minutes. Quickly add the coconut cream, put a clean tea towel on top, cover again and leave for 15 minutes. Fry the peanuts in a dry pan until you can smell them toasting, then set aside. Heat the oil in the same pan, fry the anchovies until crisp and golden, then tip them on to a piece of kitchen paper to drain. Boil the eggs for seven to nine minutes, depending on how hard-boiled you like them, then cool under running water, peel and halve. Cut the cucumber into thick slices. To serve, put a mound of rice on each plate, add a spoonful of sambal to the side, then add the peanuts, anchovies, eggs and cucumber alongside. Serve the rest of the sambal on the table for people to help themselves.

4/6/2022,"When Harold Pinter was preparing to play the patriarch and ex-butcher Max in a 2007 radio production of his 1965 masterpiece The Homecoming, he was asked how he would know if he’d nailed the part. “If you get it right, it’s a good pong,” he replied, “and if you don’t get it right, it’s a bad pong.” By that measure, Jamie Glover’s expert revival produces a most outstanding stink. Keith Allen is Max, holding court from his armchair in the bleak north London house he shares with his younger sons – the shark-like pimp Lenny (Mathew Horne) and the dopey boxer Joey (Geoffrey Lumb) – and his ineffectual brother Sam (Ian Bartholomew). Into this corrosive existence strolls Max’s eldest child, the philosophy professor Teddy (Sam Alexander), back from the US to introduce his wife, Ruth (Shanaya Rafaat), to the family. “They’re not ogres,” he smiles. Yet there is a warped fairytale element to Liz Ascroft’s spectacular set, its back wall decked out in morbid grey-green flock wallpaper that reaches into the heavens, making the house seem as tall and inescapable as Rapunzel’s tower. On to that vast space are thrown spidery Nosferatu-like shadows as characters climb or descend the staircase. Within this imposing setting, Glover keeps the wickedly funny production finely calibrated on the level of gesture – a slight tilt or turn of the head is enough to transmit shockwaves, the eerie tableaux between scenes signalling how abruptly moods and allegiances can change. Allen deftly negotiates Max’s handbrake turns from splenetic to sentimental, while Horne and Alexander spar elegantly as the rivals whose words flash like switchblades beneath their urbane facades. Bartholomew’s low-key tenacity as Sam makes the sustained macho tensions seem more equally matched than usual. Most surprisingly, Lumb brings a surly comic pathos to Joey, a role that can sometimes get lost in the shuffle. As Ruth, who represents to the men not just the mystery of female autonomy but their horror of change, Rafaat projects an air of amused relish as she takes the family apart one by one. Joey may spend his days in demolition but for Ruth it’s a round-the-clock job.

4/6/2022,"‘Married in haste, we may repent at leisure.” This piece of cynicism from William Congreve’s play The Old Bachelor (1693) has since become proverbial. Not least, because it’s true. Just think of one marriage you actively envy. Go on. I dare you. Got one? Thought not. Reading about unhappy marriages is just so much more … not fun, exactly. Bracing? Comforting? Real? There’s the inevitable, ghastly thrill of schadenfreude. But also the creaturely pang of recognition. The Chosen, my novel about Thomas Hardy’s fraught marriage to his first wife, Emma, features a writing career that’s gone well, and a marriage that’s gone badly. It’s 1912. For 20 years Em and Tom, now in their 70s, have been living in virtual isolation from each other at Max Gate, the large house on the outskirts of Dorchester which he built for her. They occupy separate rooms and barely speak to each other. Once Em was intensely involved in his writing, acting as his copyist and daily support. But their marriage has long been soured by his success and self-absorption. And then quite unexpectedly, one November morning, Emma dies. In the days that follow, Hardy, still stunned by this sudden loss, discovers a cache of diaries that she had secretly kept about their life together, ominously titled What I Think of My Husband. In particular, she accuses him of having been her jailer, and of having deliberately deprived her of the chance to have children. He’s thrown into utter confusion and must start re-evaluating his entire marriage – and himself. In my novel (as in life) the Hardys have a particularly trying marital setup, but they aren’t unique in this. Here, in all their awfulness, are my favourite depictions of coupledom gone wrong: 1 Macbeth by William ShakespeareYou’re a brave Scottish general, doing your bit for king and country, when you run into a trio of witches who predict that you will one day become king of Scotland yourself. No sooner have you gone home to your castle and shared this surprising news with your lady wife than she’s twisting your arm to commit regicide. The result: civil war, hellish regret, and madness all round. Codependent marriages don’t get much worse than this. 2 Ethan Frome by Edith WhartonUnless of course you’re Ethan Frome, henpecked Massachusetts smallholder. Your wife, Zeena, notices everything, especially your new habit of shaving daily and the shy glances you’ve been exchanging with the help, her gentle cousin Mattie. What hope do you and Mattie have of living together? None. Pretty soon you’ve decided to die together. But your plans – a sled, a tree, a crash – go wrong. You end up lame, and Mattie is paralysed for life. Zeena is now in full control. Nightmare. 3 A Handful of Dust by Evelyn WaughLanded country gentleman Tony Last thinks he’s happily married to Brenda, the mother of his eight-year-old son. But Brenda is bored and starts an affair with a total scrounger. Her attempts to fix Tony up with a mistress are all unsuccessful: he’s too uxorious. Their boy is killed in a riding accident, Brenda demands a divorce, and Tony tries to escape the wreck of his life by taking a trip to the Amazon. He loses everything – including, perhaps, his sanity: when we last see him, he’s being held captive in the jungle by a monomaniacal Dickens enthusiast. What’s worse than being married to Brenda? Being forced to read the complete works of Charles Dickens aloud for the rest of your life. 4 Wide Sargasso Sea by Jean RhysThis is the backstory to the ultimate dysfunctional landed country marriage, the Rochester-Mason union in Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre. You’ll remember that while wooing Jane, Edward Rochester was, inconveniently, already married to a Creole heiress called Bertha Mason. And that she was mad. And locked up in the attic of his grand pile, Thornfield Hall. Rochester insisted that Bertha’s insanity was hereditary, but Rhys devastatingly suggests the ways in which his emotional abuse of his vulnerable young wife contributes to her deteriorating mental state. 5 The Pumpkin Eater by Penelope MortimerMrs Armitage is an imprisoned wife of a different kind. She has an “army” of children from three marriages and is now on her fourth, to philandering scriptwriter Jake. Her capacity for love has made her weak. When she falls pregnant by Jake, he asks her to have a termination and sterilisation and she agrees, before discovering that he’s expecting a child with his actress girlfriend. In their marital war Jake is clearly going to be the winner. 6 Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? by Edward AlbeeGeorge, a middle-aged academic at a New England college, staggers home with his wife, Martha, after a boozy faculty evening. Martha mentions that she’s invited over another couple, Nick and Honey, to continue the party. Cue spectacular drunkenness, ferocious mind games, and queasy revelations. By the end of this Walpurgisnacht, Martha has bedded Nick, Nick has disclosed Honey’s “hysterical” pregnancy, and George and Martha are left to confront the reality of their own childlessness and contempt for each other. 7 Revolutionary Road by Richard YatesFrank and April Wheeler are a pair of thirtysomething suburbanites in the 1950s US with failed bohemian dreams. Frank once had vague hopes of being a writer in Paris which were foiled by marriage and parenthood. Now he’s really going to do it! At the crucial moment April tells him that she’s pregnant again. Frank (who’s been screwing a co-worker and doesn’t in fact want to leave his mundane job) is secretly relieved – only for this story of ordinary disappointment to balloon into tragedy when April dies during a mismanaged abortion. 8 Far from the Madding Crowd by Thomas HardyBathsheba Everdene has it all: good looks, wit and her own farm. What she doesn’t have is reliable taste in men. She rejects a proposal from steady shepherd Gabriel Oak to marry the sexy, flashy Sergeant Troy. In a short time, she’s reeling from the news that Troy had a fiancee who died giving birth to his child. Troy vanishes, only to reappear and claim Bathsheba just as she’s about to make another disastrous match. Luckily Gabriel is around to pick up the pieces. 9 Heartburn by Nora EphronDelectably acid, this is the quintessential marital revenge novel: a roman à clef, based on the collapse of the marriage of Ephron (then a food writer) to the political journalist Carl Bernstein. Rachel Samstat and her husband Mark Feldman have moved to Washington, DC, for his career. Then Mark has an affair with Thelma Rice (AKA Margaret Jay) who resembles a giraffe “with big feet”. Small-footed Rachel not only dumps him but writes this bestseller, too. Bonus: the book is studded with delicious recipes. 10 Olive Kitteridge by Elizabeth StroutFor the last 25 years Olive has been married to Henry, a self-effacing small-town pharmacist. She’s a terrible spouse. She’s irascible, blunt and never, ever apologises. Another local couple are at a concert when they see Olive come in with Henry. “I don’t know how he can stand her,” says the husband. “He loves her,” says the wife. “That’s how he can stand her.” Strout’s canny novel celebrates traditional marital values, even while acknowledging that these are rooted in fantasy.

4/6/2022,"The UK government is set to order more drilling for oil and gas in the North Sea in defiance of its own net zero targets, while neglecting alternative measures that experts say would provide much quicker relief from high energy bills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions instead of raising them. The energy security strategy to be unveiled on Thursday will acknowledge the need to move away from fossil fuels, the Guardian understands, but still allow for licences to explore new oil and gas fields to be expedited and more production from existing North Sea fields. Ministers are expected to say the UK needs more oil and gas in the short term, including new sources of fossil fuel imports, to replace the small proportion of UK oil and gas that comes from Russia, and ease pressure on prices. The government will present North Sea oil and gas as lower carbon than imported gas, according to a Whitehall source, to meet the UK’s needs while ramping up renewables and nuclear power. Yet the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change presented a “now or never” warning on Monday, showing that new fossil fuel exploration will put the Paris agreement target of limiting global heating to 1.5C beyond reach. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, who will present the energy strategy, is strongly in favour of ramping up renewable energy over oil and gas, but under pressure from Tory rightwingers the government is set to offer a heavy emphasis on gas, with few measures on insulation or switching to heat pumps. The strategy will also set out: A review of the scientific advice on the safety of fracking. The Guardian understands that Kwarteng thinks fracking in the UK is unrealistic and uneconomic, but under pressure from the right will keep the option open. Doubling the target on the use of hydrogen, from 5GW to 10GW, of which half will come from “blue” hydrogen created from fossil fuels, despite evidence that it emits more carbon than coal. Ministers are expected to present blue hydrogen as a necessary bridge to future “green” hydrogen from renewable energy, but campaigners say it will lock in high emissions. A boost to offshore wind, with the expansion of existing coastal offshore windfarms and potential new floating platforms in deeper waters, but solar energy risks being missed. Investment in new nuclear reactors being made easier. Few new measures on ramping up heat pumps and no comprehensive national programme to insulate housing on the scale experts say is feasible and would make a real difference to the cost of living. Hopes for a major loosening of planning regulations in England that would allow more onshore wind will be dashed, owing to cabinet opposition. This is despite multiple opinion polls showing a large majority of people in favour of windfarms, including most Conservative voters and people in areas near actual and proposed turbines. Green campaigners said new North Sea fields licensed today would produce no gas for years or decades but result in continued higher emissions long into the future. Meanwhile, the bigger opportunity – of cutting energy waste – risks being missed. The government’s independent climate adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, has expressed its strong disapproval of plans for more extraction in the North Sea, but said last month it was powerless to prevent it. Philip Evans, oil and gas campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: “Rushing to sign off new fossil fuel licences that’ll take decades to get going would be no help in standing up to Vladimir Putin, and would actively make the climate crisis worse. The quickest and smartest solution to the energy challenge and the cost of living crisis is a huge push to tackle energy waste. If your bathtub is leaking, you should fix the leak – not just turn up the taps.” Fixing the leaks seems to be low down on the government’s priority list, however. Successive attempts to insulate Britain have failed, for various reasons: poor administration, in last year’s disastrous green homes grant; complex rules and low incentives for its predecessor “green deal” scheme that was abandoned in 2015; and overall a half-hearted, short-term and piecemeal approach from the government. Experts say what is needed is a concerted nationwide push to roll out insulation, double glazing and heat pumps, concentrating first on households in or at risk of energy poverty. Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of the trade body Energy UK, said: “The benefits of making our homes energy efficient are so overwhelming that nobody seriously disagrees with its importance, but as a country our efforts so far have got nowhere near the scale required. Now is surely the time to press ahead with something that is proven to [reduce bills] by hundreds of pounds a year permanently.” There is little sense that the government is prepared to put in the large-scale effort required. Ed Matthew, campaigns director at E3G, warned: “There is technical potential to halve gas consumption in UK homes. But to realise that extraordinary potential means unleashing a new wave of public investment to help every household to make their home super energy efficient. This requires a wartime effort to build up an army of installers to insulate our homes and fit heat pumps and to ensure it is affordable for everyone.” If the UK wants to stop importing gas by next winter, that would be theoretically possible if every home were made energy efficient, according to calculations by Jan Rosenow, director of the Regulatory Assistance Project. He said: “We import about 150 terawatt-hours of gas for home heating every year. None of this would be needed if we insulated our homes and switched to heat pumps. “We could save more gas than we import for heating with existing technologies. What is needed is the government to step up its policies now to roll out insulation and deploy heat pumps as quickly as possible.” Behaviour change is also out of favour. Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, has urged people to turn down their thermostats by just 1C, from about 22C on average to 21C – which is still at the upper end of comfortable. But the government is reluctant to call on people to do anything that could be regarded as a sacrifice. Another area of concern is solar power. Offshore wind – Boris Johnson’s favourite form of renewable energy – will get a big boost in the strategy, but solar could lose out despite being the cheapest form of power in the UK and the fastest to get up and running, according to Chris Hewett, chief executive of the industry body Solar Energy UK. He said the UK could reach 54GW capacity for solar power by 2030 – about 17% of the UK’s electricity needs – with the right backing. Plans for some large solar farms have run into opposition, and solar panels are still expensive for most households, despite the removal of VAT on panels. Hewett said: “To unlock the full potential, we need to see the government setting an ambitious target and speeding up investment in the modernisation of our power networks. Supportive planning guidance and a formal recognition that land within a solar farm is frequently used for agriculture or to enhance biodiversity would also enable solar to play an important role in rural economies.” The Guardian understands there are no plans for the government to seek “wriggle room” on missing or delaying the UK’s carbon budgets or legally binding net zero target.",News/Environment,UK to defy net zero targets with more oil and gas drilling,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/06/uk-more-oil-gas-drilling-north-sea-energy-security-strategy-kwasi-kwarteng-net-zero-targets
4/6/2022,"President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s address to the UN security council came at a crucial moment for the United Nations as well as Ukraine. Russia’s illegal war of aggression, and the collective failure of the other 192 member states to stop it, represents the biggest crisis for the UN since Iraq in 2003. This visceral threat to the organisation’s authority – practical, legal and moral – is one from which it may not recover. The principles enshrined in the 1945 UN founding charter, primarily aimed at upholding peace between sovereign states, have been torn up by the Kremlin. Repeated pleas by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, for an immediate end to hostilities are ignored. And the humanitarian laws of war are being brutally disregarded, as the multiple crimes committed in Bucha, Mariupol and across Ukraine show. The UN did not happen by accident. Nor should its aspirations and responsibilities now be considered optional or somehow secondary. Following the collapse of the League of Nations, it emerged from the smoking ruins of the second global conflict of the 20th century. The shared, urgent motivation was simple: “never again”. Seventy-seven years later, governments and nations badly need reminding of its central message. Amid febrile talk that the invasion of Ukraine could spark a third world war, the UN charter has renewed relevance. Its preamble states: “We the peoples of the United Nations, determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind, and to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights [undertake]... to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another as good neighbours, and to unite our strength to maintain international peace and security”. Unsurprisingly, Vladimir Putin’s regime has trashed the obligations entered into by its Soviet predecessors. Dismayingly, China – like Russia, one of five veto-wielding permanent security council members (the others are the US, the UK and France) – is also failing to abide by the charter, while other leading states, such as India, unhelpfully twiddle their thumbs. The UN has not been silent on Ukraine. At the beginning of March, 141 countries in the 193-member general assembly adopted a resolution demanding that Russia immediately end all military operations – more than the required two-thirds majority. Only North Korea, Eritrea, Syria and Belarus (and Russia) voted against. So what happened? Nothing. Were penalties issued or enforcement action taken? No. Three weeks later, the assembly overwhelmingly passed another resolution, insisting on aid agency access and civilian protection and criticising Russia for creating a “dire” humanitarian situation. This must have been about the time that, as we now know, civilians in Bucha were being executed, raped and tortured by Russian troops. Once again, the UN vote was largely ignored by Moscow. The 15-member UN security council, the one body that really could make a difference, had already proven its impotence. In the days following the invasion, a resolution condemning the assault failed after Russia used its veto. China, India and the UAE abstained. Ukraine’s furious ambassador memorably told the council: “ Your words have less value than a hole in a New York pretzel”. Not giving up, Zelenskiy called on Tuesday for council members to stop what he says is a genocide and expel Russia from the security council, which he said was paralysed and ineffective. Kyiv, he said, wants a transparent, international investigation. In fact, the UN human rights council has already begun an inquiry. And later this week the US and Britain, which currently holds the security council presidency, will attempt to expel Russia from the UNHRC. “We cannot let a member state that is subverting every principle we hold dear to continue to participate,” said Linda Thomas-Greenfield, US ambassador to the UN. “Russia’s participation in the human rights council is a farce.” Most objective observers would certainly agree. In truth, her words may be said to apply to Russia’s presence in the UN as a whole. How can the rank behaviour of a violently aggressive, out-of-control rogue regime possibly be tolerated indefinitely? And how can the UN be made more effective? These fundamental questions now hang over the UN’s future. They apply, too, to other serially abusive states. But Russia is key, given its privileged post-1945 position. If the UN is to retain its authority as guardian of the international rules-based order, if it is to be able to act decisively when those rules are broken, and indeed, if it is to survive at all as anything more than a talking shop and stage for gesture politics, it desperately needs reform. This is not a new idea. Numerous proposals have been floated and sunk over the years, mostly involving the enlargement of the UNSC’s permanent membership to include states such as Japan, Brazil, India, South Africa and Germany. Some suggest abolishing the UNSC veto. All such ideas have predictably foundered on national rivalries and the jealous preservation of existing rights, with Britain and France prominent among the guilty parties. This situation plainly cannot continue while Ukraine burns. A sensible, doable first step would be to change the rules, via an exceptional one-off vote, to allow majority voting in the security council on specifically Ukraine-related issues. Russia’s inevitable veto could be overridden, and the rule change ratified, by the anti-Russia two-thirds majority that already exists in the general assembly. If Putin didn’t like it, he could lump it. And if he didn’t comply with subsequent resolutions – for example, on withdrawing Russian forces – all UN members would be expected to support UN-agreed punitive measures, as in the case of North Korea. Majority voting in the UNSC could be introduced more generally over time. But, in any event, Guterres should now ask all member states to support the convening of a new foundational conference akin to that in San Francisco in 1945, to relaunch the UN, institutionally and organisationally, in ways that reflect the global power balances and priorities of the 21st century. This is a critical moment. Ukraine needs urgent help. The UN desperately needs a fresh start. And so, too, does the disintegrating international order. If the UN fails over Putin and Ukraine as the League of Nations did over Mussolini and Ethiopia, then the global consequences, as in the 1930s, may be catastrophic for all.

4/6/2022,"Actor Sean Penn has said Ukraine “will win” its war with Russia, in a series of TV appearances designed to boost support in the US for Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and the country’s effort to repel the invading forces. Penn appeared on The Last Word With Lawrence O’Donnell on MSNBC, where he affirmed his belief that Ukraine is “going to win this thing … it’s a certainty.” He stressed the unity of the population, adding: “It’s an exciting moment in history … They look at each other and they say we’re together.” Penn said that he found Zelenskiy and Ukrainian unity to be an inspiration for the American people, offering the US a way to overcome the divisiveness that has plagued it for decades, saying: “This is freedom of thought and true leadership that is just so moving. It’s the kind of moving that we need to be able to get [to the US], which is borderline a kind of populist lapdance of a nation at this point. We’ve got to get back on track together and realise that Ukraine, with all its diversity, has a unity we’ve never seen in modern times.” Penn also appeared on Fox News’ show Hannity, where he discussed the war with host Sean Hannity. Penn praised Zelenskiy saying: “In him, I saw something I’d never seen before,” and repeated his assertion of Ukraine’s eventual victory over Russia. “It is clear to me that the Ukrainians will win this. The question is at what cost.” Penn was revealed to have been in Ukraine making a documentary as the Russian invasion began, and was present at a press briefing in Kyiv in February, having previously visited the country to shoot footage in November. At the time Zelenskiy released a statement saying: “Sean Penn is among those who support Ukraine in Ukraine today. Our country is grateful to him for such a show of courage and honesty … The more people like that – true friends of Ukraine, who support the fight for freedom – the quicker we can stop this heinous invasion by Russia.” Penn has continued to vocally support the Ukrainian cause, calling for private money to buy fighter planes for the Ukrainian air force and demanding that Zelenskiy be allowed to speak at the Oscars ceremony, saying he would “smelt [his Oscars] in public” if it didn’t happen. In the event, Zelenskiy did not address the Oscars but did make an appeal to the audience at the music industry equivalent, the Grammy awards.",Arts/Film,Sean Penn says Ukraine ‘is going to win this thing’,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/06/sean-penn-says-ukraine-is-going-to-win-this-thing
4/6/2022,"“If you can’t beat them, join them” is loser talk. If you can’t beat them, buy 10% of them, and then they’re the ones who have to beat you. That, at least, seems to have been Elon Musk’s conclusion, after he ended a month of whining about the social network, on the social network, with a $2.9bn purchase of 9.2% of the social network. From the Guardian: Elon Musk has built up a 9.2% stake in Twitter, according to filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday. Twitter shares jumped 26% in pre-market trading on the back of the news that the world’s richest person holds shares worth almost $3bn in the micro-blogging platform. Musk, the maverick boss of Tesla and SpaceX who has an estimated $273bn (£208bn) fortune, owned 73,486,938 Twitter shares on 14 March according to the filing. Those shares were worth just under $2.9bn based on Friday’s closing price, but will now be worth about $3.6bn. There’s scant further information about the purchase for the time being. The SEC filing, a form called Schedule 13G, is mandatory for anyone who takes control of more than 5% of a given company (which means that, theoretically, Musk could have owned 4.9% of Twitter before now without needing to disclose it). And, crucially, it requires you to commit to being a passive investor. Which is why it was somewhat odd that Twitter’s chief executive Parag Agrawal announced on Tuesday that Musk would be taking up a board seat: I’m excited to share that we’re appointing @elonmusk to our board! Through conversations with Elon in recent weeks, it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our Board. Musk is a committed user of Twitter. A very committed user. Let’s have a brief overview of the Tesla chief executive’s history on the site: Twitter is surely close to his heart, as the place he met his (ex?) girlfriend and mother of his (two?) children (look, it’s complicated), Grimes. The tale of their courtship is oft-told: Musk tweeted out an odd pun involving a theoretical AI hellscape before discovering that Grimes was the only other person who had made the same weird joke. He slid into her DMs and that was that. In his professional life, though, Twitter is almost certainly better remembered as the reason why Musk now legally has to have a lawyer sign off on all his tweets. In August 2018 he tweeted that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private at $420 a share (the amount apparently picked as an odd weed-culture joke). Since Musk did not, in fact, have funding secured – he had, maybe, had preliminary discussions with a few investors – the US Securities and Exchange Commission made the not-unreasonable argument that he’d illegally communicated false information to investors, slapped him with a fine and forced Tesla to appoint said lawyer. Summer 2018 was a fertile time for Musk. Just one month before the “funding secured” post, he sent a tweet which, for a normal person, would have resulted in the most legal trouble they’d ever been in for a tweet. The billionaire, who had offered his services to help rescue a boys’ football team that had become trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand, apparently became outraged when a British diver mocked his suggestion of a mini-submarine to help, and responded by calling him “pedo guy”. Despite doubling down on the claim, tweeting “Bet ya a signed dollar it’s true” to one follower, and hiring a private investigator to find out whether the diver really was a paedophile, Musk managed to convince a US court that the claim was a meaningless insult and avoided libel damages. Running through all the controversial tweets that haven’t resulted in either two children or a lawsuit would take up most of this newsletter, but Musk has also compared Twitter’s new chief executive to Stalin, said that the first two letters of “SEC” stood for “Suck” and “Elon’s”, called the coronavirus “panic” “dumb” in March 2020, obliquely called for an end to restrictions in April that year, and said we should “Nuke Mars”. If there’s one through line we can take from a tour of his tweeting past, it’s that Musk is one of the few people on the planet who has a more self-destructive compulsion to tweet than I do. But if there’s a second through line, it’s that the man has a massive issue with authority, and a particular issue with the authority of the SEC. Which takes us back to that Schedule 13G filing. The document’s a shorter version of a much longer, and much more detailed, form called Schedule 13D, which is to be used only if you’ve relinquished direct or indirect control. Doing so lets you avoid disclosing certain things, like how much you paid for the stake, or the source of your funds. But at the last minute, it looks like Musk blinked. Just hours before this newsletter was published, he filed an updated version of his disclosure, recategorised under 13D, and revealing that he has committed, as part of the agreement that gives him a board seat, not to acquire more than 14.9% of Twitter while sitting on its board, or within 90 days of leaving. It still leaves open the question of why he tried to hide his activist status in the first place, but should be enough to keep the SEC off his back – over this issue, at least.

4/6/2022,"The European Union has given €35bn (£29.1bn) to Vladimir Putin for energy supplies since the start of his war and €1bn to fund Ukraine’s defence, the union’s top diplomat said. Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, made the comparison in a characteristically blunt speech to the European parliament, as he urged Europe to send more arms to Ukraine to help end the war. “We have to continue arming Ukraine. We need less rounds of applause and more assistance,” he said. The EU has pledged €1bn in military aid for Ukraine, he said, which “might seem a lot” but “€1bn is what we pay Putin every day for the energy he provides us. Since the beginning of the war we have given him €35bn. Compare that to the €1bn we have given to Ukraine in arms and weapons.” He made the comments as the EU debates a fifth round of sanctions against Russia, with a ban on coal imports worth €4bn from the country expected to be announced soon. EU work on sanctions intensified as officials reacted to appalling reports from Bucha and other Ukrainian towns, where civilians have been murdered, tortured, raped and abused. Poland and the Baltic states argue that the energy ban should also target Russia’s far more lucrative oil and gas exports, but have faced resistance to immediate action from Germany, Austria and Hungary. The EU imports 41% of its gas and 27% of its oil from Russia, but these figures are much higher in some member states. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, who is expected to travel to Kyiv with Borrell in the coming days, promised the latest sanctions would not be the last. “Now we have to look into oil and we will have to look into the revenues that Russia gets from fossil fuels.” EU officials, she told MEPs, would study an Estonian idea in which payments for Russian gas would be put in an escrow account, ie in the hands of a third party, with the aim of limiting revenues to the Russian state that could fund the war effort. Europe’s energy autonomy hinged on renewable energy, Borrell said, as he lamented the fact the EU had become dependent on fossil fuels from repressive regimes around its borders.",News/World news,"$1bn for Ukraine, $35bn for Russian energy: EU chief calls out funding gap",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/06/1bn-for-ukraine-35bn-for-russian-energy-eu-chief-calls-out-funding-gap
4/6/2022,"Activists who aim to choke off the supply of petrol to south-east England have occupied the region’s busiest oil terminal. Supporters of the Just Stop Oil campaign used telescopic ladders to climb over the fence at Navigator oil terminal in Thurrock, Essex, at 3am on Wednesday morning after trekking along the banks of the Thames to reach the rear of the site. After using sleeping mats to avoid being impaled on the spiked fenceposts, they sprinted through the site to its loading bay, where fuel tankers are filled for deliveries to petrol stations across the south-east. Once there, they used lock-on devices and superglue to obstruct activities. Activists from @JustStop_Oil have trespassed on to Navigator oil terminal in Thurrock to stop deliveries of petrol pic.twitter.com/kEqpkHS5vb A source with the campaign said they believed the Navigator terminal to be the most important fuel distribution centre in the the south-east, with up to 50% of the region’s vehicle fuels distributed from the site. “Navigator is by far the busiest terminal in the south-east,” the activist told the Guardian. “Navigator, when it’s running, has about 60 tankers an hour going out.” Police were removing some protesters by 7am. But six or seven had been able to clamber up into the pipework in the ceiling of the loading area, making their removal more difficult, Just Stop Oil’s activist said. Activists from @JustStop_Oil run through the Navigator oil terminal on their way to disrupt its operations pic.twitter.com/0dK5iTe4Cg Just Stop Oil began taking action against oil terminals across the south and in the Midlands on Friday, at one stage blocking 10 in various locations. They are calling on the government to agree to a moratorium on new licences for fossil fuel projects and have vowed to disrupt fuel distribution until their demand is met. Speaking from her lock-on position inside the terminal, one activist, named as Hannah from Brighton, said: “I’m 23 and the only way people will listen to me is if I lock on to the pipework of a fuelling station. Boris Johnson is signing a death sentence for my future by subsidising £25m a day of taxpayers money into new oil and gas. “They can take away my liberty, they can take away my freedom and they can choose to ignore the alarm we are sounding on the climate crisis. But they can’t take away my courage to put my body on the line for every young person that is suffering from extreme heat in the global south or freezing to death in fuel poverty in the UK and having to choose between heating and eating. “We are not going to die quietly. Please don’t be a bystander. Say no to new oil.” @JustStop_Oil activists have filmed and circulated this footage from inside the Navigator oil terminal in Thurrock pic.twitter.com/onxerU1fgY Elsewhere, seven activists blocked one nearby roundabout that the campaign said was on a key route used by tankers accessing Navigator and other nearby oil terminals, while another 11 attempted to do the same elsewhere but were intercepted by police. Just Stop Oil’s activists have targeted the Navigator site repeatedly since beginning their campaign on Friday, blockading the entrance to the facility and even digging a tunnel beneath its access road in an effort to stop vehicles leaving. But an aggressive response by Essex police had forced the activists to change tactics. In recent days, van loads of protesters had been arrested on the way to the site, while a pair who had occupied the tunnels at the site had come out after police instructed firefighters to dig them out. At the beginning of the campaign, Just Stop Oil’s activists had managed to blockade sites in London, Essex, Hampshire, Hertfordshire and the Midlands, in the hope they could choke the supply of fuel to the capital. Explaining the strategy, a campaign supporter said: “In the first 24 hours, we closed almost 100% of the south-east’s fuel supply. Petrol stations have three days fuel, so that means in 24 hours one-third will close, in 48 hours, two-thirds, and in 72 hours all of them will shut. “That’s why in the first two days it was maximum intensity, to push it over the edge. We nearly pushed it over the edge and some started to close. Birmingham was targeted as that was viewed as the next place that would have the capacity to supply London.” On Wednesday morning, after the activists invaded the Navigator site, the first police vehicle to arrive at the scene, inside the fenced off area, was a Welsh police van, suggesting that Essex police had called in mutual aid from other forces to tackle the threat posed by Just Stop Oil.

4/6/2022,"Prince Charles repeatedly sought the advice of Jimmy Savile, who was later revealed to have spent decades sexually abusing women and children, even going so far as to take his suggestions to the Queen, a documentary has claimed. Notes from the the Prince of Wales to Savile uncovered by the producers show that, over the course of about 20 years, Savile became an unofficial adviser to Charles. And they shed light on the extent to which the disgraced former television presenter was able to influence the highest offices of the British state before his death in 2011. The makers of the Netflix documentary Jimmy Savile: A British Horror Story have revealed that Savile produced a PR handbook for royals and their staff. Some of that advice was then incorporated in a note prepared for the Queen, the Times reported. The producers believe that followed an incident in which Prince Andrew made insensitive comments about the Lockerbie bombing during a visit to the disaster site in 1988. The director Rowan Deacon told the Times that the event “reignited a discussion about how the royal family should respond to disasters”. She said: “Jimmy Savile wrote this dossier, quite an in-depth document of advice, on how the Queen should behave and how members of the royal family should not be in competition with each other.” In a handwritten note to Savile, Charles later wrote: “I attach a copy of my memo on disasters, which incorporates your points and which I showed to my father. He showed it to [the Queen].” Speaking to the Times, Deacon claimed Buckingham Palace’s response was “quite lukewarm, and Charles [was] frustrated by that. We know that from the exchange”. In a letter soliciting suggestions on how to “get to parts of the country that others don’t get to reach”, Charles referred to Savile as the “bloke who knows what’s going on”. And, in another note in 1989, he wrote: “I wonder if you would ever be prepared to meet my sister-in-law — the Duchess of York? Can’t help feeling that it would be extremely useful to her if you could. I feel she could do with some of your straightforward common sense!” In a letter written the following year, Charles told Savile he was “so good at understanding what makes people operate and you’re wonderfully sceptical and practical”. There is no suggestion Prince Charles knew anything about Savile’s crimes, which came to the public’s attention decades later.

4/6/2022,"You probably had to be there to fully understand the energy of being in a record-breaking, history-making crowd for women’s football. As I texted Sophie Downey – my newsletter co-writer – when the game ended: “How do you top that?” The truth is that the night of 30 March 2022 is going to be known as a turning point for the women’s game. There were 91,553 loud people at the Camp Nou as Barcelona beat Real Madrid 5-2. And I am not only talking about that game. Paris St-Germain also broke their attendance record at Parc des Princes with more than 27,000 fans. Thousands of supporters also attended the other six legs of the Champions League quarter-finals. And while that was happening, tickets for the Euro final in July sold out. The Champions League broadcaster Dazn said there was “unprecedented growth” for the quarter-finals. That includes more than 2.6 million live views worldwide for the broadcaster (including their YouTube channel, where it is free to watch) only for the clásico. The week before, they had already broken audience records as 1.3 million people watched the first leg live. Overall, on YouTube, there were more than 11 million views for the quarter-finals. During the group stage, the figure was 14 million in total. This wasn’t just something that “happened” to women’s sports: it is a result of decades of fighting. But why was it Barcelona of all clubs that took it to the next level? We asked Lucy Mills, who is the programme manager at the FC Barcelona Foundation. She lists four main reasons: 1) I believe that Barça fans and Barcelona citizens are incredibly proud of the women’s team; people love the players’ style of play as much as they do the personalities. They’re down-to-earth, likeable and personable characters. Perhaps during the rockier spells of the men’s team the women’s team provided another outlet of pride for Socios/Socias and fans. 2) The match was advertised EVERYWHERE. Billboards, TV, news, etc. It was hard to not know that the game was happening. 3) Match tickets were priced at between €9 and €15, a price point that was accessible for a broad range of people. Experiencing Camp Nou is a once in a lifetime experience and this was an affordable opportunity to do so, especially for those otherwise priced out of usual match ticket prices. 4) The changing tide towards equality in football and greater support of women’s football chimes well with Barcelona citizens. It’s a progressive and open-minded city. The government is active in its support for refugees, for LGBTQI+ rights, for women’s rights and for sustainability. It’s no surprise that its citizens come out in their thousands to get behind the women’s team. On Tuesday the tickets for their home semi-final against Wolfsburg sold out too. That is fantastic but it is important to remember that women’s football is growing everywhere. I am from Brazil and although we won’t easily fill every stadium with a national championship that is only 10 years old, we are working and evolving. Seeing these numbers is extremely helpful to know that we can dream of having that historic day too. We can have a 30/03/2022 of our own, and so can other countries. An international flavourFriendlies and World Cup qualifiers take centre stage over the next week. We’ll have 2023 World Cup hosts Australia and New Zealand facing each other twice. Brazil play Spain and then Hungary. Argentina and Chile also play twice. Meanwhile, the European qualifiers group phase has Sweden, Netherlands, England, Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, Germany and France currently leading their groups and trying to clinch a spot for the 2023 World Cup. A friendly that raised my eyebrows? USA v Uzbekistan. Time for changeHaving qualified for the World Cup for the first time, the Philippines national team said they do not want people to use the nickname “the Malditas” anymore. The nickname, as a Portuguese native speaker, was always dubious for me, as it can mean something like “cursed”. They do not want this double meaning – it can be interpreted as “feisty” or the B-word (bratty, as you probably imagined). Some fans were upset by the decision to be called “Filipinas” instead of a catchy nickname but, playing on the world stage, they decided to be known for who they are. Inside informationThis week Sweden launched their kit for the 2022 Women’s Euros – and it was an eye-catching one. On their kit there are instructions for the other teams of how to beat them, written by Anders Eriksson, their lead match analyst. There is also a full guide online. “I’m almost speechless, honestly. This has been utterly magical. When the match finished, the fans simply didn’t want to go home […] There was such a connection between them and us while we celebrated. To hear them singing that they want to go to Turin was superb” – Alexia Putellas after Barcelona v Real Madrid. Real Madrid played their part in the game at the Camp Nou and Claudia Zornoza’s goal was a long-range beauty. Away from that game, Alex Morgan did the business in the NWSL with a sweet volley. Leah Williamson has said it is “the biggest honour” to be named England captain for this summer’s Euros. There were wins again for Chelsea and Arsenal in the Women’s Super League, meaning that the title race continues at a breathtaking speed. Here are this week’s WSL talking points.

4/6/2022,"When you’ve waited nearly 30 years to make a record, what’s a two-year delay in touring it? Such is the fate of the Psychedelic Furs, who in 2020 released Made of Rain, their first album since 1991, only to find the gigs to promote it stymied by the first Covid lockdown. “Sorry about all the cancellations we’ve had! It’s good to see you all,” drawls Richard Butler, although it’s a surprise he can see anything at all through his inevitable rock’n’roll shades. The vocalist remains an elegant stick insect, a tremendously compelling old-school frontman possessed of a winningly imperious swagger. The Psychedelic Furs formed in the post-punk rush of 1977 yet their provenance was far more classicist. Art-rockers to their preening core, they took their name from the Velvet Underground’s song Venus in Furs and their musical cues from the doomed-glamour leftfield pop of Roxy Music and, overwhelmingly, David Bowie. The six-piece started out all attitude and angularity but broke into the mainstream, on both sides of the Atlantic, in the 80s when they embraced pop smarts, radio-friendly melodies and killer tunes. Typical was the honeyed The Ghost in You, dedicated tonight to recently deceased punk icon Jordan and a fantastic slice of suave, sinister pop noir. Butler’s nicotine rasp of a vocal remains a thing of wonder on Pretty in Pink, a misreading of which famously inspired John Hughes’s 1986 high-school romcom movie. Tonight’s set has lulls: new tracks Don’t Believe and Ash Wednesday are broodingly atmospheric but lack the barbed-velvet alchemy that the band summon at their peak. Yet the 65-year-old Butler is still a fantastic showman, all bows, feints and cross-legged crouches on the mannered croon of 1984 single Heaven. The Psychedelic Furs encore with the opening two tracks of their self-titled 1980 debut album: the immaculate angst of Sister Europe and the adrenaline flail of India, which could be John Lydon’s Public Image Ltd in a fearful bate.

But here they are, with Shady Murphy’s matriarch in tow as the lone woman, pummelling their way through Jamie McGough’s true-life family drama about boxing. The first-time playwright is a relative of Sean, Martin, Jarlath and Jimmy McGough, four boxing brothers from an Irish Catholic family brought up in Coventry. In 1979, Jarlath was in line to successfully defend his title as Irish light-heavyweight champion, but as the play tells it, faced resistance from officials who had a grudge against English-born competitors. A decision by the referee to disqualify him in the crucial bout sparked a riot and a court case – with Jarlath and Martin in the dock. So far so Rocky, but McGough adds a political edge by framing the story in its historical context. Christian James plays Sean as a young firebrand more obsessed with the campaign for Irish unification than he is with boxing, despite his own skill in the sport. The treatment of the brothers – too Irish to be English, too English to be Irish – stands as a metaphor for the historical sidelining of Catholics in Northern Ireland. This was not just a sporting defeat, McGough argues, but a symbol of how the underdog is victimised over and over again. In this way, the play swings from ringside tournament to courtroom drama, intercut with nationalist speechifying as McGough keeps us up to speed with the intersection of sectarianism and sport. It’s a lot for the playwright to tackle and it isn’t certain that this family anecdote, however fascinating, can carry as much weight as he wants it to. The story remains more particular than universal. What is not ambiguous is the brute force of Corey Campbell’s excellent production. Performed in the round on Patrick Connellan’s ringside set, in the style of Claire Luckham’s wrestling play Trafford Tanzi and Nick Ahad’s Glory, it has an exhilarating physicality. The good-looking cast stomp, punch and sing their way through a rigorously choreographed show, precisely lit by Joe Hornsby, with Louis Ellis’s Jarlath and Daniel Krikler’s Martin as convincing in their boxing moves as they are touching in their dedication to sporting honour.

4/6/2022,"When Xeo Chu was four, he had a figurative period. “Ears are very difficult to do,” the 14-year-old Vietnamese art prodigy tells me at his first solo exhibition in London, as we examine his first painting, a portrait of his mother. Nguyen Thi Thu Suong is a fitting first subject for the artist. She owns two galleries in Ho Chi Minh City and encouraged Xeo and his two brothers to take drawing lessons not long after they could walk. “Without mum, of course, I would be, like, nothing. I certainly wouldn’t be here talking to you.” He bows sweetly and takes my hands. “Not that that’s a bad thing.” The story his mum tells me is that Xeo Chu would beg to be allowed to attend art classes with his older brothers. So she gave him a pencil and an eraser and let him attend lessons after school. His brothers gave up the lessons, but Xeo Chu had found his passion. “I love painting. Even if I am sometimes lonely when I paint it fills me with joy. I disappear for hours while I am painting.” If, to my eyes, there is nothing outstanding about that first portrait – the charmingly oversized ears and even the maternal smile the little boy fondly gave his subject would be unexceptional, if delightful, if you saw them gracing a nursery school wall – Xeo Chu’s artistic development in the decade since is extraordinary, at least judged in terms of sales and column inches. He sold his first picture to a visitor to his mum’s gallery. “I was really happy. That was when I was like six.” Since then his work has been collected all over the world from the US to Japan and beyond. Today critics regularly compare him with Jackson Pollock, his pictures come with $150,000 price tags and, with this new exhibition in London’s Mayfair following others in Vietnam, Singapore and New York, he has had solo shows on three continents. Not bad work for anyone, but especially remarkable for someone born in 2007. Xeo Chu is even more of a rebuke to slacker teens than this suggests. He combines the precocity of Diego Rivera (who began drawing at the age of three) with the great-heartedness of Marcus Rashford. When he was 10, Chu had his first painting exhibition in Singapore and used the $20,000 proceeds to support heart surgery funds, the elderly living alone and street children in his city. Last summer, Xeo Chu sold eight of his works as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in an online auction on his Facebook pages, donating the total proceeds of the auction – VND2.9 billion (£96,000) – to a hospital to buy medical equipment to combat Covid-19. His mother says: “He may only be a little boy but I am learning from him. He is teaching me what it is to be generous.” And last summer, too, he proved himself to be at the cutting-edge of art during a show in Ho Chi Minh City that could be visited virtually by art lovers around the world, thanks to a wheeled telepresence robot that enabled spectators to look closely at 30 different paintings created during the pandemic. It also allowed them to interact with Xeo Chu as he painted live. Now is the moment that you might want to break off from this article to text your underachieving offspring a cross-face emoji. I ask Xeo Chu if his brothers and school mates get resentful of his success? “I really don’t like talking about my painting to them for just that reason. I kind of keep it hidden from my friends.” We climb a staircase to the main exhibition of his work, passing on the way walls hung with his earliest paintings. These are the works that caught the eye of his art teacher, Nguyen Hai Anh, who told Chu’s mother: “This is the first time I saw a four-year-old child draw like that. Palm lines fly, firm like a true artist.” One of them is a landscape he painted aged five as he sat on a terrace overlooking the city’s District 4 canal. There are other paintings of dogs, a trellis of bitter melon, sunshine slanting through the doorway – and lots of flowers. “I love flowers,” says Thu Suong, “and it makes me very happy when he paints them.” One day, she received a bouquet of peonies. She tells me that she loved them so much she stayed home for three days to look at them. Xeo Chu noticed her hugging the vase. “I drew three colour pictures to prevent my mother from wilting any more,” the boy told one interviewer. As he developed, Xeo Chu (which means “little pig” – his real name is Pho Van An) took photographs of what he saw on trips to the countryside and made paintings of them at home. “I love nature. That is what I find beautiful. I want to draw and paint what I see.” This, I suggest, makes the comparison with Jackson Pollock seem misplaced. The abstract expressionist, after all, didn’t paint what he saw – at least not in the way that you do. “Oh Jackson Pollock!” laughs Xeo Chu, feigning exasperation. “Everybody says I’m like him, but I’m not so sure.” We’re standing before one of the colourful abstract paintings from his more mature, non-figurative period that induced New York gallerist George Bergès, who put on Chu’s first American show, to compare his work to Pollock’s: “Xeo Chu is creating similar works from the very beginning of his career.” Bergès argues that Chu’s 300-plus painting oeuvre taps into the collective unconscious in a way older artists struggle to manage. “To me it was very interesting to work with an artist who’s before puberty, because it challenged my notions about art and how life experience has to go into it. If there is depth and complexity in a piece of work from someone who has very limited life experience, it gives you a glimpse of the universal unconscious that we all have and can tap into.” Perhaps: or maybe the perspective of one of his collectors, Karlene Davis, New Zealand consul general in Vietnam is nearer the mark. “I love the way Chu shows light and colour. He sees more than the naked eye and shows the spirit of the picture. They are so delicate.” Show me, I ask Chu, your favourite painting. He takes me to a work hanging over a fireplace, a sunburst of a sunset. “I had been indoors for so long because of the pandemic and then finally we went to the country so this showed how I was feeling to be back in nature again.” His best paintings, I think, are landscapes, such as his series depicting northern Vietnam’s Mu Cang Chai terraced rice fields (“The wave of yellow [in the rice fields] when the harvest season comes is incredible,” he says of his 2019 canvas October, Autumn in Canada). His biggest piece so far, Ha Long Bay in Cave, which measures 200cm x 480cm, took three months to paint. Has your work evolved? “It definitely has. When I started I saw mainly flowers so I painted them. Then I started to travel so I painted some of the really unique landscapes of Vietnam. We go to Canada sometimes.” Will you paint what you see in London? “I hope to have time.” Chu is hardly the first artistic child prodigy. In 2013, Kieron Williamson a 10-year-old from Norfolk dubbed the “Mini Monet”, saw his lifetime earnings soar to £1.5m after 23 of his works sold for £250,000 in under 20 minutes. When Romanian-American artist Alexandra Nechita, dubbed “Petite Picasso” for her cubist works, was 11 in 1996 her works sold in the $100,000 range. But when collectors put pieces by these artists on the secondary market, they do not necessarily fare well, according to art appraiser Barden Prisant. Writing in Forbes magazine, Prisant found that the top recent auction he could find for a Nechita was only $20,000. “Revealingly, and disquietingly, that very same piece had sold in 1998 for $92,000.” Prisant found that two of Williamson’s works auctioned recently did not sell. Perhaps Xeo Chu’s celebrity and bankability will be similarly brief. None of this matters to Xeo Chu. “I don’t really know what prodigy means. And I don’t really care. That’s not why I paint.” His teacher rightly points out that his pupil is not bound by any school or rule, and so his work has a youthful freshness. “He always let me be free to choose what I want to draw and paint,” laughs Xeo Chu. “Sometimes he will say ‘that would look better done like this’ but they’re only suggestions.” The worry is that the youthful freshness will dissipate as Xeo Chu grows up and gets seized, as surely all adult artists are, by the anxiety of influence. Bergès says his client needs to be protected from too much press, which I suspect is right: too much exposure that could make Xeo Chu reflect on things that are irrelevant to making art. The exhibition in London is a retrospective of his first 10 years as an artist. Can you imagine what another exhibition in 10 years would look like? “Who knows if I will still be painting,” he replies. Xeo Chu tells me he doesn’t know much art, but he wants to learn. When I tell him that in the gallery next door to his exhibition is a show of work by the late Swedish mystical artist Hilma af Klint, Xeo Chu looks fascinated to learn that someone was instructed by spirits to paint her canvases. His mum tells me that they are spending time in London with a view to her son studying art here. You could become the next Tracey Emin or Damien Hirst, I tell him. “Well maybe,” he says, uncertain. “But I’m not really sure what I want to be when I grow up. I’m just a kid.” Xeo Chu: Big World Seen from Little Eyes is at D Contemporary, London until Friday.",Arts/Art and design,14-year-old art sensation Xeo Chu: ‘I kind of keep it hidden from friends’,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/06/14-year-old-art-sensation-xeo-chu-i-kind-of-keep-it-hidden-from-friends
4/6/2022,"As Deborah Meaden gears up for her 17th series of Dragons’ Den, which she joined in 2006, she meets me at the Guardian’s offices. She is maybe 90 seconds late and does this lightning three-act apology – that she is sorry; why it happened (taxi driver didn’t know the way); how we could move on (he was actually a very nice guy) – which transmitted, in a tiny but meaningful way, what she always puts across on screen. Here is a woman who will sort things, who will take responsibility, who means what she says, who will not overreact, who doesn’t make the same mistake twice. Since she joined Twitter in 2011, and ever more so since Brexit, Meaden has added common sense and trenchancy to traits visible in her public persona. She always came across, in the Den, as having a rich bass note of kindness and generosity. All the guys are so hard-charging and alpha, full of phrases like “I don’t see what’s in it for me”, offering half the investment asked for, for five times the stake. Meaden has always stood out – I mean, she’s not running a charity, as the business people like to say, but she doesn’t go in bristling with ego, looking for the win at every turn, and this seems to play well for her decision process since all but a handful of her businesses are still active (If you ever have a slow moment, you can go through the episodes to see which investor has the best hit rate. It’s quite fun, like the end-of-the-year roundup of the racing tips from Radio 4’s Today programme.) In short, if Carlsberg did business people, they would probably be Meaden, hard-boiled but humane, single-minded but rounded, confident but modest – well, not modest exactly, simply not that interested in her own qualities, since that’s not what she’s selling. She was born in Taunton in Somerset in 1959, to a formidable mother – “she never looked for sympathy. She never looked for help” – with whom she shares that toughness but, she says, very little else. “She must look at me sometimes and think, ‘how did I spawn this child?’ I’ve never seen her without her makeup. She’s 84; they have a social life which exhausts me to even hear about.” “They” is her mother and mother’s third husband, who Meaden considers her father: “He’s the person who was there’; I don’t think anybody else has the right to call themselves that”. She did meet her “real” father (she always puts the “real” in airquotes) at 15, but says: “I didn’t, honestly, at that point, feel anything for him. He was a stranger to me. He could have been anybody in the street.” Meaden is always in a hurry, but never more than when she’s racing to tell you why everything was fine, actually. She’ll acknowledge a difficult situation – her mother was divorced twice by the time Meaden was two, and had two small girls to look after in a really unhelpful decade – but only to explain why it’s best to just get on with it. She went to a number of boarding schools, hating them all, but insists: “You know what? My life is my responsibility. There were people who loved boarding school, so it can’t have been the schools. It was me, in the schools. It was not right for me.” She really prizes self-sufficiency, but the accent is all on the sufficiency rather than the self – she tells me a sweet story about being in an airport where the announcements had stopped working, and arranging the queues so professionally that people started to complain to her, thinking she worked for the airline. “My husband died a thousand deaths.” Her robustness, the total absence of anxiety or self-pity, she puts down to the fact that “nothing awful has ever happened”, which I guess she would. It’s hard to place her class, because her upbringing was fluid – she’d be at boarding school in the term, and then spend the holidays at Butlin’s, where her mother had a concession. “I was lucky. You meet this amazing range of people, and you learn how to work in different environments. I never needed people to like me, to prove I fitted in. I was happy being me. And there was no point me trying to pretend to be terribly posh. Or not posh.” Her early years were precarious, but in her early 20s she joined her family’s thriving holiday park business, which she later bought from her parents for undisclosed millions. She loathes snobbery above all things. “I can’t stand it because it’s always founded on the wrong thing. It’s founded on money, or education. It’s never founded on, ‘that’s a good person’, or ‘they’re in a difficult situation’.” And whether or not she cares about money – realistically, she must a bit, she has an estimated net worth of £40m – she did not go a bundle on education, taking a vocational course at Brighton technical college (as was) instead of A-levels. She didn’t do any work. She really loved funk. She loves to dance – everyone who’s ever been on Strictly Come Dancing, as she was in 2013, eventually makes that claim, but in her case it seems to be true. She’s only ever had one non-entrepreneurial ambition, which was to be a showjumper, “but I was absolutely rubbish. I’m not an idiot. I could see I was rubbish.” Her life story, if she were allowed to tell it uninterrupted, would leap from one business venture to another, from her first import business as a teenager, bringing in glass and ceramics from Italy and cutting deals with department stores. And even that she won’t admit was in any way unusual, that she might have been particularly intrepid or had a good eye. “Driving backwards and forwards to Italy, what’s the worst that could happen?” And as for the ceramics, “I like creativity. I like different. I like that in a person, too. But it’s my eye, isn’t it? I can’t say that’s good taste or bad taste. It’s just my taste.” Meaden had a brief period in textiles before joining the family business in the early 80s. She did their bingo calling, and there’s still a slight theatricality to her gestures. She sometimes reminds me of Liza Minnelli in the Cabaret years. And that must have come from the bingo, because on the Den, she’s extremely, well, businesslike. “I am rubbish at what makes good entertainment. I just turn up, sit in a seat, I do what I do and they turn it into a bit of magic. I’m not an actor. I can’t do stuff I don’t want to do. I can’t pretend I’m interested if I’m bored. I’m not seeking fame. I do it because it’s the thing that I do anyway.” While calling the numbers, in either 1984 or 85, she met her husband, Paul, who’s “the most competent man in the world. He’s a fantastic cook. He grows all our own vegetables. He’s in touch with the earth. He’s not interested in doing what I do, but he still wants me to do what I do, and I want Paul to do what he does. We’re just two people who found each other, and filled in the gaps.” Perhaps I’d expected more flowery language than “competent” of a nearly 40-year relationship, but she talks about marriage like your classic, 70s bloke. If someone were to play her in a movie, it would be Michael Caine. “It just works. Listen, everybody goes through ups and downs. But there was never a point at which … no, that’s not true. We split up before we got married. He wanted to get married and I absolutely didn’t. We used to have those circular arguments, him saying, ‘but why won’t you get married?’ And me saying, ‘what’s the point, we’re gonna stay together for the rest of our lives?’– ‘if that’s right then Deborah, why don’t we just get married?’ You know, we’d go round and round in circles. I still say to this day, he made me, he forced me. I was literally standing there outside the church, saying, ‘I’m doing this for Paul’. He knows this! But I also say, and he knows this, too, that it’s the best thing I ever did.” Dragons’ Den came calling in its third season, and she initially refused, “because I was very concerned that I would lose control of the nice life that I’d built. Once you step out into the limelight, you can get knocked off course.” In fact, none of the things you’d worry about, being in the public eye, ever transpired (much) – when people approach her in the street, “they’re talking about my subject. They’ve often got an idea. It might be rubbish, but honestly, people who complain about getting approached on the street, get off television.” It has a lot more upsides than down. “It opens doors that I used to have to work so hard for. I find myself saying ‘no’ to things and thinking, blimey, if you’d told me in my bingo calling days I would have been too busy for that. If I call somebody, pretty much anyone will pick up the phone.” In recent years, let’s say the past five, Meaden has been known as the businesswoman who will say the things that no one else in business would – that Brexit was an act of self-sabotage, that politicians should tell the truth, that children shouldn’t be going hungry in the holidays or, indeed, ever. The echoing silence coming from industry over political decisions that will, sooner or later, have a massive industrial impact has been really peculiar, I think. It’s a long time since Boris Johnson said “fuck business”; how come business people never say “fuck Boris”? “Oh they do. Maybe not to the papers. I think the media has got a part to play in that. They wouldn’t have to look very hard to find somebody who was prepared to say it. But Boris is a weird one. He says stuff, and people say “Oh that’s just Boris.” No, that is not just Boris. He is our prime minister. What he says counts. You can’t just shrug your shoulders.” She came out very strongly against Brexit, but has a great deal of sympathy for business peers who didn’t. “I’m an investor, and I can say what I like. A lot of businesses have shareholders, and half of them will probably be pro Brexit, half of them would have been against Brexit. I’m not actually defending it. Because it was such an important thing. I think we had a responsibility to point out what was actually going on. But I do understand why I was in a much stronger position.” Determinedly politically un-affiliated, she has voted every which way in her life, she says. Labour, the Lib Dems … she’d vote Tory if they got their act together. “I’m a true floating voter. I have to agree with most of what a party is promising, and I have to believe that they’re going to deliver it. I never used to have to think about, do I believe you?” She seems to me to be a shoo-in for Labour’s celebrity-bench, but I’d chosen the wrong dragon to canvass, and I’d also reckoned without her environmental commitment. She’s more likely to vote Green. The one piece of work she did do at Brighton technical college was a dissertation on climate change (this was unbelievably prescient, in the 70s), and she won her first environmental award in business 30 years ago. “When I was first in Dragons’ Den, they used to call me Swampy.” Her new radio show is called The Big Green Money Show and well, the clue’s in the name: she is dedicated to interrogating businesses, nascent, established, small and large, about exactly what their intentions are towards the planet. “I have a very sensitive nose to greenwash. But at least businesses understand now that it matters to the consumer, and if it matters to the consumer, it matters to the business. The consumer has all the power. If we want things to change, buy differently. Put your pension somewhere else, don’t put it in fossil fuels.” If you’re a bit sceptical that consumers really are the answer, well, she’d have time for that point of view but wouldn’t, I don’t think, lose sleep over it. Since her first business venture, selling flowers aged seven, she’s been finding the thing she could do, and doing it. The Big Green Money show is on BBC Radio 5 live at 5am on Fridays and is available as a podcast on BBC Sounds and Apple",Arts/Television & radio,"‘I never needed people to like me’: Dragons’ Den star Deborah Meaden on snobbery, fame and her 40-year marriage",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/06/i-never-needed-people-to-like-me-dragons-den-star-deborah-meaden-on-snobbery-fame-and-her-40-year-marriage
