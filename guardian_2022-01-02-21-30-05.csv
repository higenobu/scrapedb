1/2/2022,"Last-minute moves to tackle the spread of the Omicron variant of Covid in schools, colleges and universities in England will not be enough to avoid disruption or stop large-scale absences among staff and students, unions and school leaders have warned. The Department for Education announced that masks should be worn indoors in education setting in England, including in classrooms, libraries and corridors, from the start of the new term until the end of January.  It also said it had ordered 7,000 air purification units for nurseries, schools and colleges, “for areas where quick fixes to improve ventilation are not possible, such as being able to open a window”. But the units will not be delivered until next month. School staff unions, which have repeatedly called for additional measures, criticised the government for failing to take action earlier as Covid infections rose rapidly among students and staff. “An increase in the use of face coverings and better ventilation are welcome but should have been in place before Christmas to have slowed the infection in schools,” said Jon Richard, Unison’s assistant general secretary. Data from the Office for National Statistics show that school-age children have been among the most likely to be infected, with more than one in 20 primary-age children and one in 35 secondary-age children testing positive for Covid in December. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the biggest challenge facing schools remained staff shortages: “While schools and colleges will do their very best to minimise the impact on pupils, as they always do, there is a possibility that this will mean that some classes and year groups have to be sent home for short periods of time to learn remotely.” Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the order of 7,000 purifiers would be “completely inadequate” for providing clean air. “The fact that the government have provided the extra purifiers shows that it recognises the problem but with over 300,000 classrooms in England they have failed to provide an effective solution,” Bousted said. Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, said the government needed to go further to minimise disruption throughout the academic year, including more on-site testing in schools to quickly tackle outbreaks. “We still need to see a credible and funded plan from the government that will deliver immediate support and flexibility for those schools experiencing teacher shortages,” Roach said. Ofsted, the schools inspectorate for England, will not inspect secondary schools or colleges on the first week of term. Current school leaders who also act as Ofsted inspectors will not be asked to carry out inspections, while schools affected by Covid staff absences should request deferrals of inspection visits. The DfE said the mask advice for students in year 7 and above would remain until 26 January, when it will be reviewed alongside other mitigation measures. The advice also applies to further and higher education providers such as colleges and universities. The advice is for masks to be worn in classrooms, corridors and other communal areas indoors but that they did not need to be worn outdoors or during “exercise or strenuous activity” such as PE classes. In primary schools the DfE’s current advice is that masks should only be worn by staff in corridors and communal areas.",News/Education,"Moves to tackle Omicron in English schools not enough, unions warn",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/02/moves-to-tackle-omicron-in-english-schools-not-enough-unions-warn
1/2/2022,"Ihad an uncle who, intermittently and not necessarily simultaneously, wore a kilt and played the violin. Each to me was exotic – twin roads to freedom from the dullness of a prosaic, southern English childhood. For a short time I took up highland dancing, with real swords and modest skill. I was seven when I begged to be allowed to join the new string class at school. Above all, I wanted the “equipment”: an eighth-sized violin and silk scarf to wrap it in, bow, spare strings, heavy wooden case with green felt lining (just as I’d wanted the kilt, jacket, sporran, jabot and special laced shoes for dancing). The other children soon dropped out, bored by playing long, slow notes on open strings. It was deadly indeed and sounded awful. There’s no quick path to becoming even a modestly accomplished violinist. Left on my own, things progressed. The nice teacher complimented me on my “good ear” as I sawed through Will Ye No Come Back Again. I won a place at the junior department of a London conservatoire, going by myself, aged 11 until I left school, every Saturday morning: negotiating public transport, having breakfast in cafes and spending the afternoon wandering up and down Charing Cross Road, wondering at the mysterious rubber “health” objects (health meaning sex) hidden at the back of seedier secondhand bookshops. It was an education. It was, too, a wonder I escaped unscathed. A few creepy flashers aside, I was left alone.  The only abuse I got, looking back, was from the bullying violin teacher I was assigned. The experience of being confined in a tiny practice room with an emotionally and psychologically threatening adult is, alas, not rare for children learning musical instruments. The necessary intimacy of one-to-one lessons can be a joy or a peril, the risks only very recently brought into the open, and monitored. The same could not happen now. In my case, the problem was not sexual. This teacher, I’ll call her Mme Lorgnette – you must picture her, squeezed into the unlikely attire of gold lamé smoking jacket and matching skirt, and muddied brogues – arrived late every week, puffing and blaspheming, pulled by her charmless dog. While I struggled to play dull technical exercises, madame blew smoke rings from her cigarillos and read her newspaper, occasionally screaming “Shut up!” at the dog (or it may have been at me) as it yowled in open contest. Both dog and owner were acridly malodorous, the windowless room a fug. Every minute was torment. At the end of each session, I had to take the dog outside (“make sure it does its business”), making me late for my next lesson elsewhere in the large building. But I had a scholarship. I was lucky to be there. My parents were proud. How did one complain, by oneself, at that age? No one ever asked how I was getting on, or inspected a lesson, or wondered why my progress was so pitifully slow and lacklustre. Fortunately, I had no intention of becoming a professional violinist, for reasons of aptitude, application and self-consciousness at performing. I can’t entirely blame that teacher, but the experience closed off options. I learned less than I might have done. Yet those Saturdays were part of my identity and, in a combative way, the passport to wider horizons I so wanted. Though my playing had stalled, I loved the other lessons: the theory and orchestra and music history. Without realising, I was equipping myself for the job I would eventually have: writing about music. After I’d stopped lessons and the drudge of exams, everything changed – too late, yet just in time. I went on exciting music courses and spent every spare moment playing in student ensembles. No one shouted at me. There was, even, laughter. Music came alive, it became life. I began to play in string quartets (that is, usually, two violins, viola and cello) with friends and sometimes strangers. There’s an unrivalled pleasure in playing chamber music: a joint venture in which merely getting through can be harder, and more rewarding, than you’d ever think. New worlds opened. To forge the link between myself and the violin – by now in my first job as a journalist – I commissioned a new instrument, not a common procedure, for amateurs or professionals. I was introduced to a violin-maker, Juliet Barker, who was just establishing an important English violin-making school in Cambridge. I saved my meagre earnings each month to pay for it, and watched as, over two or more years, seasoned white wood turned to varnished gold and became an instrument. No one else has ever played that violin. It’s far superior to any I could otherwise have afforded, old Italian instruments being preeminent. It remains my prized possession. The brakes went on when children arrived. I was a violinist but one who was resting. The children grew up. I started playing again, as far as a busy schedule would allow, and reunited with the same friends. They’d gone on playing in the intervening years and opened the circle to let me back in. Then, not long ago, I smashed my left arm, the one that creates the notes. Surgery and metal worked miracles but left it stiff. A Schubert string quartet can last 40 minutes. Straightening the arm afterwards takes a bit of teeth gritting. For a professional player, that everyday accident would have ended their career. As so often in life – read Marcel Proust, read Anthony Powell – the music of time has danced its onward dance. New lodgers, models of the species, moved in, one a master luthier, or maker of stringed instruments. The quiet plucking of lute or oud sometimes wafts up through the floorboards (a rare boast in Peckham, south-east London). Could he put a little love back into my violin, neglected in lockdown? He took it off to his workshop, discovered its maker – now a revered pioneer and veteran in her 90s – and admired her craft. He renewed the glue and adjusted parts that had cracked or shifted, restoring the instrument’s tone and vitality. I can’t call playing the violin a hobby. It’s part of me, silent or not. Like everyone, I’ll make various improbable resolutions for the new year. If I can get together with friends in one room to play quartets or trios or duos, I’ll be OK. Just don’t expect me to go it alone. The rise of online lessons means that an army of tutors awaits the chance to discover your dormant virtuoso. Websites such as Music Teachers or Private Music Lessons are good places to look. Arts Council England-supported music hubs can also help you access lessons or groups in England. Many centres of musical excellence – such as Sage Gateshead and the Royal Academy of Music – offer lessons and community programmes for beginners and enthusiasts. The British Council has a list of national initiatives which might inspire you. If you’re a lapsed musician and want to find other people to play with, look at Making Music or Contemporary Music for All. Both sites let you search for groups in your area from choral societies to samba bands.

1/2/2022,"For more than a decade, Paddy Jones has been wowing audiences across the world with her salsa dancing. She came to fame on the Spanish talent show Tú Sí Que Vales (You’re Worth It) in 2009 and has since found success in the UK, through Britain’s Got Talent; in Germany, on Das Supertalent; in Argentina, on the dancing show Bailando; and in Italy, where she performed at the Sanremo music festival in 2018 alongside the band Lo Stato Sociale. Jones also happens to be in her mid-80s, making her the world’s oldest acrobatic salsa dancer, according to Guinness World Records. Growing up in the UK, Jones had been a keen dancer and had performed professionally before she married her husband, David, at 22 and had four children. It was only in retirement that she began dancing again – to widespread acclaim. “I don’t plead my age because I don’t feel 80 or act it,” Jones told an interviewer in 2014.  According to a wealth of research that now spans five decades, we would all do well to embrace the same attitude – since it can act as a potent elixir of life. People who see the ageing process as a potential for personal growth tend to enjoy much better health into their 70s, 80s and 90s than people who associate ageing with helplessness and decline, differences that are reflected in their cells’ biological ageing and their overall life span. Of all the claims I have investigated for my new book on the mind-body connection, the idea that our thoughts could shape our ageing and longevity was by far the most surprising. The science, however, turns out to be incredibly robust. “There’s just such a solid base of literature now,” says Prof Allyson Brothers at Colorado State University. “There are different labs in different countries using different measurements and different statistical approaches and yet the answer is always the same.” The first hints that our thoughts and expectations could either accelerate or decelerate the ageing process came from a remarkable experiment by the psychologist Ellen Langer at Harvard University. In 1979, she asked a group of 70- and 80-year-olds to complete various cognitive and physical tests, before taking them to a week-long retreat at a nearby monastery that had been redecorated in the style of the late 1950s. Everything at the location, from the magazines in the living room to the music playing on the radio and the films available to watch, was carefully chosen for historical accuracy. The researchers asked the participants to live as if it were 1959. They had to write a biography of themselves for that era in the present tense and they were told to act as independently as possible. (They were discouraged from asking for help to carry their belongings to their room, for example.) The researchers also organised twice-daily discussions in which the participants had to talk about the political and sporting events of 1959 as if they were currently in progress – without talking about events since that point. The aim was to evoke their younger selves through all these associations. To create a comparison, the researchers ran a second retreat a week later with a new set of participants. While factors such as the decor, diet and social contact remained the same, these participants were asked to reminisce about the past, without overtly acting as if they were reliving that period. Most of the participants showed some improvements from the baseline tests to the after-retreat ones, but it was those in the first group, who had more fully immersed themselves in the world of 1959, who saw the greatest benefits. Sixty-three per cent made a significant gain on the cognitive tests, for example, compared to just 44% in the control condition. Their vision became sharper, their joints more flexible and their hands more dextrous, as some of the inflammation from their arthritis receded.  Scientists have developed various measures to assess people’s perceptions of ageing – which may be evident in many different beliefs. Here are a few examples: 1 Do things get better, worse or stay the same as you get older? 2 In each pair of the following words, which one do you associate with retirement and beyond: uninvolved or involved; unable or able; dependent or independent; idle or busy? 3 When does middle age end and old age begin? If you answered “better” or “the same” on (1) and “involved”, “able”, “independent” and “busy” on (2), you are more likely to experience better health as you age. On question (3), people who believe old age starts at a later point – over 70 years – live longer than people who believe that old age starts at 60 or younger. As enticing as these findings might seem, Langer’s was based on a very small sample size. Extraordinary claims need extraordinary evidence and the idea that our mindset could somehow influence our physical ageing is about as extraordinary as scientific theories come. Becca Levy, at the Yale School of Public Health, has been leading the way to provide that proof. In one of her earliest – and most eye-catching – papers, she examined data from the Ohio Longitudinal Study of Aging and Retirement that examined more than 1,000 participants since 1975.The participants’ average age at the start of the survey was 63 years old and soon after joining they were asked to give their views on ageing. For example, they were asked to rate their agreement with the statement: “As you get older, you are less useful”. Quite astonishingly, Levy found the average person with a more positive attitude lived on for 22.6 years after the study commenced, while the average person with poorer interpretations of ageing survived for just 15 years. That link remained even after Levy had controlled for their actual health status at the start of the survey, as well as other known risk factors, such as socioeconomic status or feelings of loneliness, which could influence longevity. The implications of the finding are as remarkable today as they were in 2002, when the study was first published. “If a previously unidentified virus was found to diminish life expectancy by over seven years, considerable effort would probably be devoted to identifying the cause and implementing a remedy,” Levy and her colleagues wrote. “In the present case, one of the likely causes is known: societally sanctioned denigration of the aged.” Later studies have since reinforced the link between people’s expectations and their physical ageing, while dismissing some of the more obvious – and less interesting – explanations. You might expect that people’s attitudes would reflect their decline rather than contribute to the degeneration, for example. Yet many people will endorse certain ageist beliefs, such as the idea that “old people are helpless”, long before they should have started experiencing age-related disability themselves. And Levy has found that those kinds of views, expressed in people’s mid-30s, can predict their subsequent risk of cardiovascular disease up to 38 years later. The most recent findings suggest that age beliefs may play a key role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease. Tracking 4,765 participants over four years, the researchers found that positive expectations of ageing halved the risk of developing the disease, compared to those who saw old age as an inevitable period of decline. Astonishingly, this was even true of people who carried a harmful variant of the APOE gene, which is known to render people more susceptible to the disease. The positive mindset can counteract an inherited misfortune, protecting against the build-up of the toxic plaques and neuronal loss that characterise the disease. Behaviour is undoubtedly important. If you associate age with frailty and disability, you may be less likely to exercise as you get older and that lack of activity is certainly going to increase your predisposition to many illnesses, including heart disease and Alzheimer’s. Importantly, however, our age beliefs can also have a direct effect on our physiology. Elderly people who have been primed with negative age stereotypes tend to have higher systolic blood pressure in response to challenges, while those who have seen positive stereotypes demonstrate a more muted reaction. This makes sense: if you believe that you are frail and helpless, small difficulties will start to feel more threatening. Over the long term, this heightened stress response increases levels of the hormone cortisol and bodily inflammation, which could both raise the risk of ill health. The consequences can even be seen within the nuclei of the individual cells, where our genetic blueprint is stored. Our genes are wrapped tightly in each cell’s chromosomes, which have tiny protective caps, called telomeres, which keep the DNA stable and stop it from becoming frayed and damaged. Telomeres tend to shorten as we age and this reduces their protective abilities and can cause the cell to malfunction. In people with negative age beliefs, that process seems to be accelerated - their cells look biologically older. In those with the positive attitudes, it is much slower - their cells look younger. For many scientists, the link between age beliefs and long-term health and longevity is practically beyond doubt. “It’s now very well established,” says Dr David Weiss, who studies the psychology of ageing at Martin-Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg in Germany. And it has critical implications for people of all generations. Our culture is saturated with messages that reinforce the damaging age beliefs. Just consider greetings cards, which commonly play on of images depicting confused and forgetful older people. “The other day, I went to buy a happy 70th birthday card for a friend and I couldn’t find a single one that wasn’t a joke,” says Martha Boudreau, the chief communications officer of AARP, a special interest group (formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons) that focuses on the issues of over-50s. She would like to see greater awareness – and intolerance – of age stereotypes, in much the same way that people now show greater sensitivity to sexism and racism. “Celebrities, thought leaders and influencers need to step forward,” says Boudreau. In the meantime, we can try to rethink our perceptions of our own ageing. Various studies show that our mindsets are malleable. By learning to reject fatalistic beliefs and appreciate some of the positive changes that come with age, we may avoid the amplified stress responses that arise from exposure to negative stereotypes and we may be more motivated to exercise our bodies and minds and to embrace new challenges. We could all, in other words, learn to live like Paddy Jones. When I interviewed Jones, she was careful to emphasise the potential role of luck in her good health. But she agrees that many people have needlessly pessimistic views of their capabilities, over what could be their golden years, and encourages them to question the supposed limits. “If you feel there’s something you want to do, and it inspires you, try it!” she told me. “And if you find you can’t do it, then look for something else you can achieve.” Whatever our current age, that’s surely a winning attitude that will set us up for greater health and happiness for decades to come.

1/2/2022,"Amid rocketing Covid infection rates, rising hospitalisation numbers and test shortages, the opening weeks of 2022 are going to be defined by the UK’s vaccine gap. According to the latest official figures, 91% of people aged over 18 in the UK have had at least one Covid jab, 88% have received two and 64% have had their third. But the 9% who have yet to be vaccinated at all accounts for about five million people, whose preponderance among those now being hospitalised is clearly a huge problem.  Precise figures are a matter of debate: some senior NHS staff put the share of unvaccinated people on their wards at up to 90%, although the most recent estimates show the share of people needing critical care who are unvaccinated running at just over 60%. What cannot be doubted is that if more people were vaccinated, the latest phase of the Covid crisis would be much more manageable, and the people in charge might not be faced with such a difficult set of options. If the NHS is soon overwhelmed, tightening across-the-board restrictions might become inevitable, but it would highlight the unfairness of disrupting the lives of the vaccinated majority to protect those who are still unjabbed. Coercing people into getting vaccinated using stringent Covid passports – let alone introducing compulsory inoculation – would infuriate the Tory backbenches, make Boris Johnson’s future all but impossible, and even to many of us outside Conservative circles mark a worrying extension to the state’s reach, not least under a government as illiberal as this one. There are, in fact, no clear and easy choices, beyond retaining a vague hope that the sudden urgency of the pandemic’s latest phase might convince more people to pitch up at a vaccination centre, and keeping faith in the grassroots organisations currently doing their best to change minds. To some people, though, the issues are completely straightforward. Ten days before he was made a Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, Tony Blair issued a characteristically sweeping verdict: “If you’re not vaccinated and you’re eligible … you’re not just irresponsible, you’re an idiot”. He later expressed regret about his choice of words, but by then it was rather too late: he had already triggered a wave of judgment on social media, suggesting that most unvaccinated people were either reckless fools, or the unhinged disciples of those online cults that put the past two years of human history down to a quest to tighten the grip of the secret world government. Inevitably, the facts of the vaccine gap are immeasurably more complicated, as no end of statistics prove. According to the latest numbers published by the UK Health Security Agency, 30% of eligible people in Liverpool are yet to receive their first jab. In Birmingham, the figure is 33%; in the London boroughs of Newham and Tower Hamlets, about 38% and 34% respectively. Conspiracy theory and misinformation are sizable and worrying features of the Covid era, and our politicians still say surprisingly little about them. But particularly in cities, beyond high levels of mobility and transience, figures showing large numbers of unvaccinated people reflect much deeper questions of age, class, ethnicity, faith and language – and what poverty, insecurity and institutionalised prejudice do to people’s relationship with the state. In that sense, the limits of the vaccination drive remind us of one of the most simple truths of power and politics: that if governments continually ignore fundamental issues of trust and basic empathy, any big social rupture will instantly reveal the consequences. Earlier this week, I spoke to Manisha Kumar, an inner-city GP in Manchester and the medical director of the city’s health and care commissioning partnership, which is steering a grassroots vaccination drive that involves an array of local organisations centred on the city council. The main figures she and her colleagues work with are based on people registered with a medical practice. Some come with caveats, but they show the proportion of eligible Mancunian adults who have not received even a single vaccine dose currently standing at about 30%. In more affluent areas of the city, less than 20% of eligible people have not been jabbed, but in some poorer neighbourhoods, the figures tend to hover at about 50%. In aggregate, white people who identify as English, Scottish, Welsh or British register vaccine uptake levels of more than 80%, whereas the current number for people from a Caribbean background is 52%; among those classified as Gypsy or Irish traveller, the figure is 28%. Such numbers, she said, only tell you so much: what is important is to get to the complex combinations of factors that make people either hesitant about vaccination, or downright hostile. “People come to this with their beliefs, their experiences of Covid, their perception of risk – there isn’t just one sort of person who hasn’t come forward,” she said. In some parts of the country, she went on, “you can just open your doors, send out a text, and people will come.” Her patch, by contrast, requires much more delicate and detailed work. “The majority of the city is hugely deprived, and lives in very small communities defined by culture, identity and geography. Knowledge of those communities is really important.” What is lacking from a lot of people’s understanding of the vaccine gap, she told me, is any real sense of the sheer weight millions of people have borne over the past two years, and how precarious their lives often are. “The pace of change, the amount of information coming out – for some people it’s just been overwhelming. They’ve gone: ‘I can’t do this – it’s too much. I’ve lost my job, I’ve got issues with domestic abuse, my children are out of school.’” She also talked about huge issues around access to the internet, made worse by vaccines being introduced during lockdown. “People didn’t have phone credit or data roaming, or wifi in their houses. So when you sent out a link saying ‘Book on the national booking service’, they couldn’t do it.” By way of getting to the heart of it all, a PowerPoint presentation she sent me made mention of “historic lack of trust in public institutions including health services within some groups and communities”. In some black communities, she said, people’s relationships with authority are so poor that that some have chosen to be vaccinated well away from where they live and work, “because they’re almost embarrassed to be vaccinated, thinking their community isn’t behind them.” She paused. “There’s no easy fix. We just keep on talking.” In a lot of what she said, there were echoes of the kind of government actions that have only furthered people’s distance from the state, from the creation of a cruel and punitive benefits system, to the hostile environment doctrine that quickly led to the Windrush scandal. Cutting spending on English tuition was always going to keep people confined to the social margins; the innumerable other ways that austerity has hacked back even the most basic everyday help has made things even worse. If you are white, middle class and confident enough to play the kind of games large institutions always demand, the state might look benign and dependably helpful. But if it usually treats you with a mixture of hostility and indifference you will tend to keep your distance, even when it says it has your best interests at heart. In the UK and elsewhere, what all that means for any attempt to make all of us move in lockstep is simple enough. The vaccine gap shows us how far we are from being a society that understands itself collectively, and how easily we still break into “us” and “them”. It demands not judgment, but a level of understanding we have yet to get near. John Harris is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,"Understanding, not judgment, should shape our response to those who remain unjabbed | John Harris",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/02/understanding-not-judgement-unjabbed-uk-vaccination-gap
