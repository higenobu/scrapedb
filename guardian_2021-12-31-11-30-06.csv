12/31/2021,"In the past few weeks, Allison Rossiter, the managing director of Roche Diagnostics, one of the first companies to have an approved rapid antigen test in Australia, has witnessed a flurry of interest from state governments. South Australia, which until a week ago had banned the use of the tests, is among their new clients. So too is Western Australia, which placed an order with the company this week despite the tests still being banned in the state.  “We have massive orders in for rapid antigen tests for Western Australia,” the WA premier, Mark McGowan, said on Wednesday. “We expect to have 8 million by 5 February and we expect to get more after that.” It hasn’t always been this way. Interviews with manufacturers and suppliers of rapid antigen testing reveal a frustration at the amount of resistance to their products in Australia until very recently. “The response from government has generally been ‘yeah we’ll look at it’ or ‘maybe in the new year’, but until now there hasn’t been any critical impetus,” Dean Whiting, the chief executive of Pathology Technology Australia, a group representing rapid antigen testing suppliers, told Guardian Australia. “There has been some confused market messaging at times and I think there is a level of frustration.” Since the beginning of the pandemic, Australia has bet heavily on PCR testing as a key plank of the country’s Covid testing and tracing system. More reliable than rapid testing and cheaper for the states to operate because it is subsidised by the commonwealth, it has meant suppliers of the faster turnaround tests were de-prioritised in the Australian market, while demand in Asia, Europe and the US soared.

During the pandemic the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia, the body that represented pathologists, has issued numerous statements warning against their use. In October last year it point-blank advised “against the widespread use” of the tests, a position it reaffirmed as recently as July. While Roche has been well-placed to fill most orders, reports of market shortages in pharmacies and shopping centres, as well as accusations of price gouging, point to a wider view in the industry that the Australia market was not worth investing in until very recently. Some companies, such as Brisbane-based Ellume, have not even bothered registering their products with the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia and instead ship their kits – which they produce about 100,000 of each day – straight to the US. “Part of the challenge for manufacturers is how much Australian product do you bring in and hold when you’ve had state governments up until very, very recently being unsupportive of rapid testing and at times even dismissing it,” John Kelly, the managing director of testing company, Atomo, said. “I suspect stock in Australia at the moment is probably less than is required to do the job and in large part that’s due to a lack of engagement, planning and preparation to get ready for this. “I’m always wary of judging a pandemic with hindsight because things are unpredictable, but certainly governments here have been resistant to point-of-care testing from the very start and there has been resistance in public health because of the diagnostic advice coming from the pathology sector.” It was only in August, when the outbreak in New South Wales saw the government pivot to rapid tests to keep some industries in operation, that the college conceded “governments and public health authorities fighting localised outbreaks may need to use RATs for surveillance testing in defined circumstances”. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning It was in that period that Rossiter’s company, Roche, began circulating a white paper to state health departments in an effort to push back on the theory that the tests were not safe for use in Australia and encourage departments to think about a future that would require more wide-spread testing than PCR allowed. “It was a gamble, but I didn’t want us to be on the back foot,” Rossiter said. “Australia is obviously a million miles from anywhere and I didn’t want to be caught out if the situation did change. “As it happened, the sudden uptick in cases due to Omicron and that coinciding with the Christmas period all snowballed at once and now you do have a situation where there is a bit of a scramble from governments.” Part of the issue has been the slow pace of approvals with the TGA. In September the TGA boss, John Skerritt, admitted that had been deliberate, as the regulator waited for a “signal” from the federal government. “We’re saying to companies, submit your data, show us, but we can’t formally make an approval decision until we get a signal from the government,” Skerritt said at the time. “It’s a decision for the government. Firstly, when they feel an appropriate time is to commit such tests. But then secondly, we’ve got to have the tests that are actually ready to go and designed so they can be used by non-professional people.” That signal eventually came when federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said he wanted rapid tests to be made available from November. But other suppliers express frustration that the approvals process has continued to be slow-going, and a lack of foresight from governments about the eventual need for rapid tests as case numbers rose after the economy opened up. During the early stages of the extended lockdown caused by the Delta variant, the NSW government issued a tender for suppliers of the tests. Released at the end of July, the tender was limited only to procurement for the state’s healthcare networks, meaning wider distribution was not considered. The Guardian understands the government eventually chose four suppliers as part of the tender, but multiple companies that bid during the tender were never contacted after submitting their bids. “It was a waste of time,” the head of one company that did not bid as part of the tender said. “They obviously weren’t looking beyond the end of their noses.” NSW Health did not respond directly to questions about the tender, but said the government had “made a commitment to make rapid antigen tests available to NSW residents early next year to boost the Covid-19 health response across the state”.",News/World news,‘A scramble’: how Australian governments flipped from resisting to embracing Covid rapid antigen tests,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/31/a-scramble-how-australian-governments-flipped-from-resisting-to-embracing-covid-rapid-antigen-tests
12/31/2021,"US senator Ted Cruz has been ridiculed for posting a tweet in which he mixed up the American state of Washington with Western Australia while criticising Covid restrictions. The Republican politician – who tried to win the party’s presidential nomination in 2016 – retweeted a post by the government of Western Australia, whose handle is WA Government – that appeared to advise a woman that dancing would not permitted at a New Year’s Eve party at her home.  Cruz, who has campaigned against pandemic restrictions, took it as cue to attack the Democrat-led state of Washington, whose widely used abbreviation is also WA, saying that those in leadership were “power-drunk authoritarian kill-joys”. This was despite the fact that the original tweet did not mention Washington. Cruz tweeted: “Blue-state Dems are power-drunk authoritarian kill-joys. Washington State: NO DANCING ALLOWED!!! Any rational & free citizen: Piss off.” Cruz deleted the tweet but not before it was picked up by opponents who mocked him gleefully for his error. US air force Lt Col Adam Kinzinger retweeted Cruz’s post and said that the Texas senator should “do your research before posting misinformation”. Since @tedcruz deleted this, I’ll post as a reminder to all of us to DO YOUR RESEARCH before posting misinformation. WA means “Western Australia” not Washington state. pic.twitter.com/jnZ2On7p9k So @tedcruz deleted this angry tweet after realizing “WA Government” isn’t Washington State, it’s “Western Australia.”FYI Deaths per million•USA: 2529•AUS: 86But more outrage over a situation that doesn’t exist than the ~29X higher death rate in America. Smh terrible. pic.twitter.com/VUenSdnfwX US Democratic congressman Eric Swalwell also picked up on the error and tweeted: “Hey Ted, WA is Western Australia. But cool tweet.” Jackpot. @tedcruz deleted his faux outrage tweet. Please stay on this phony. https://t.co/dd65BLS88I After Cruz had deleted the post, Swalwell returned fire by posting: “Jackpot. @tedcruz deleted his faux outrage tweet. Please stay on this phony”. Western Australia has imposed very strict curbs on daily life and is still closed to almost all Australians in other states. Its Facebook message to the woman came after she had asked if she was allowed to hold a party for New Year’s Eve. The reply read “masks are not required at private residences. Dancing is strictly not permitted”.",News/US news,Ted Cruz confuses Washington state with Western Australia in attack on Covid ‘kill-joys’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/31/ted-cruz-confuses-washington-state-with-western-australia-in-attack-on-covid-kill-joys
12/31/2021,"Australian batter Travis Head has tested positive to Covid-19, throwing a cloud over the fourth Ashes test due to take place in Sydney. Head is asymptomatic and will remain in Melbourne and isolate with his partner for seven days, in line with Victorian health requirements.  A Cricket Australia spokesperson says players, their families and support staff are being PCR tested daily as part of routine testing procedures. No further teammates had returned a positive result. “Unfortunately, Travis returned a positive Covid-19 result earlier today,” the spokesperson said on Friday. “Thankfully, he is asymptomatic at this stage. We anticipate that he will be available to play in the fifth Vodafone men’s Ashes Test in Hobart. “We are grateful to our exceptional medical staff for all the work they have done throughout this series and we will continue to work with and support the players, their families and staff from both teams.” The rest of the Australian squad have taken PCR and rapid antigen tests on Friday morning and are awaiting results. Cricket Australia has confirmed Travis Head has tested positive to Covid-19 following a routine PCR test.Mitchell Marsh, Nic Maddinson and Josh Inglis have joined the Australian #Ashes squad as additional cover. pic.twitter.com/zyl4j1CZcZ Head was due to travel to Sydney for the Test, due to begin at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 5 January, but he has been ruled out of the match. Mitchell Marsh, Nic Maddinson and Josh Inglis have been added to the Australian squad. The fourth Test has already been marred by rapidly rising Covid cases in New South Wales, with some calling to have it cancelled out of fear of future outbreaks. Former England captain Michael Vaughan this week pushed for the Test to stay in Melbourne to keep the series alive. “Do we want to risk taking two teams over and broadcast crews and production staff?” Vaughan told Fox Sports. “Then you get to the SCG and there’s one case in the team on day 1 and the Test match is off.“Surely Cricket Australia have to be proactive ... There’s the possibility that the Covid positive could spread around the side.” Here we go...No other active competition has been able to avoid cases and postponements this summer, it was inevitable cricket would fall the same way...#BBL11 #Ashes https://t.co/BcYSm1FlPL England’s touring party has reported no new Covid cases but head coach Chris Silverwood is remaining in Melbourne because he is isolating as a close contact. The English camp has had several family members and coaches test positive during the tour. Travis Head tested positive this morning, the average incubation period is 4 days, (that goes back to Tuesday, last day of Test) and potentially ALL could be exposed. Not sure I'd have the replacements ""joining the team"" at this stage. #Ashes #AUSvENG Head has topped Australia’s batting averages through the series’ first three tests, having scored 248 runs at an average of 62, including a starring 152 in Brisbane’s first Test. The Australian’s Peter Lalor said batter Usman Khawaja “looks set to play” in Head’s absence. Khawaja has been in superb Sheffield Shield form, scoring 460 runs at an average of 65.7 for Queensland this season, including two centuries.",Sport/Sport,Travis Head ruled out of Sydney Ashes Test after testing positive for Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/31/travis-head-ruled-out-of-sydney-ashes-test-after-testing-positive-for-covid
