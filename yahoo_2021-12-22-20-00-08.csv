12/22/2021,"After Manchin announced his opposition to the Build Back Better, the White House criticized him. Manchin was asked about the statement in a Monday interview with a West Virginia radio station. ""Basically, they retaliated. I figured they would come back stronger,"" he said. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia responded on Monday to a strongly-worded White House statement that denounced him for declaring his opposition to the Democrats' Build Back Better social spending and climate bill. ""Basically, they retaliated. I figured they would come back strong,"" said Manchin on Talkline with Hoppy Kercheval. After the West Virginia Democrat announced on Fox News Sunday that he was opposed to the Democrats' $2.2 climate and social spending bill, the White House issued a lengthy missive that was critical of the senator. ""Senator Manchin promised to continue conversations in the days ahead, and to work with us to reach that common ground,"" said White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki in the statement. ""If his comments on FOX and written statement indicate an end to that effort, they represent a sudden and inexplicable reversal in his position, and a breach of his commitments to the President and the Senator's colleagues in the House and Senate."" Manchin reportedly informed the White House of his decision just 30 minutes before his Fox News spot, refusing a call from them as they sought to talk Manchin down from his position. And CNN reported that President Joe Biden, who has sought to persuade the conservative Democrat to support the bill in recent months, personally signed off on the subsequent White House statement.  ""Just as Senator Manchin reversed his position on Build Back Better this morning, we will continue to press him to see if he will reverse his position yet again, to honor his prior commitments and be true to his word,"" Psaki said in the statement. ""In the meantime, Senator Manchin will have to explain to those families paying $1,000 a month for insulin why they need to keep paying that, instead of $35 for that vital medicine."" Other Democrats reacted angrily to Manchin's statement, and the fate of a bill central to Biden's domestic agenda now hangs in the balance. With the House having passed its own version of the bill in November, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer pledged on Monday to bring the bill up for a vote in the upper chamber ""so that every Member of this body has the opportunity to make their position known on the Senate floor, not just on television,"" he said. Manchin, for his part, seemed mostly unperturbed when Kercheval asked about the White House statement and Democratic anger towards him. ""They figured, surely to God, we can move one person, surely we can badger and beat one person, that's — surely we can get enough protesters to make that person uncomfortable enough,"" said Manchin, referring to the waves of protest that he's encountered from progressive activists in recent months. ""Well, guess what? I'm from West Virginia,"" he said. ""I'm not from where they're from, and they can just beat the living crap out of people and think they'll be submissive. Period.""

12/22/2021,"There’s still a lot we don’t know about the omicron coronavirus variant, including whether it causes more severe COVID-19 or the degree to which it evades vaccines’ defenses in real-world settings. But early data collected in London reveals the answer to a question we’re all asking: Does omicron cause different symptoms than delta and other variants? Not quite, according to the ZOE COVID Study — an app some U.K. residents use to self-report information about their coronavirus vaccination and infections. A comparison of data from thousands of people who tested positive for COVID-19 in October when the delta variant was dominant in London compared to December when omicron took over reveals “no clear difference in early symptoms (3 days after test).” The top five reported symptoms in both periods, however, suggest the common cold you think you have may actually be COVID-19. Runny nose, headache, fatigue, sneezing and sore throat were the most common symptoms among London residents, with some people also reporting loss of appetite and brain fog, data shows. Typically, COVID-19’s “classic three symptoms” include fever, cough or loss of smell or taste, but only 50% of people in the early analysis infected with delta or omicron experienced them. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study on 43 COVID-19 patients sick with the omicron variant found cough, fatigue, congestion and runny nose were the most commonly reported symptoms. But experts warn against depending on symptoms to determine if you’re sick — and with what. “The trick is you’re not going to be able to tell the difference between omicron, delta, lambda, plain COVID from the beginning,” Dr. Emily Landon, chief hospital epidemiologist at University of Chicago Medicine, told NBC Chicago. “Influenza or even common rhinovirus causes most of our common colds in the winter. You’re not going to know the difference between those if you just look at your symptoms.” “For many people, those symptoms are overlapping,” Landon told the outlet. “You’re just not going to know especially at the beginning of an illness, what kind of illness you have. You have to get tested.” The omicron variant has been detected in at least 39 states and more than 75 countries, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said during a Dec. 17 White House COVID-19 briefing. Doctors caring for COVID-19 patients in South Africa — where the variant was first detected — said in November the omicron cases they treated at the time were mild, and mostly among younger people. Dr. Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, told BBC her omicron patients had scratchy not sore throats, and didn’t have a cough or loss of smell or taste. More recent data from the country shows the risk of hospital admission among adults infected with omicron is 29% lower than that of adults infected with the original coronavirus strain when the pandemic began in 2020. However, a study by the Imperial College London found no evidence that omicron causes less severe illness than delta, based on the proportion of infected people who report symptoms or seek hospital care. It remains unclear if omicron itself is less severe or if other factors, such as characteristics of the infected population, may play a role, experts say. Meanwhile, early studies show two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine may not protect you against omicron infection, but can against hospitalization and death; booster shots significantly increase immunity. Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief White House medical adviser, said the “seriousness of infection” with omicron is “still up in the air right now.” “Certainly, looking at what we see, it does not look like it is more severe, but we have to withhold judgment,” Fauci said during the Dec. 17 White House briefing. It’s clear omicron is more contagious than other variants, he added, especially if you look at New York, where omicron infections broke the state’s record for daily new reported cases for two consecutive days. Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, told NPR the U.S. could see 1 million new COVID-19 infections per day if we let our guards down. Experts say the best way to protect yourself against omicron is to get tested frequently, social distance, get vaccinated and boosted, and wear a face mask indoors.",Health/Miami Herald,What are symptoms of the omicron coronavirus variant?

12/22/2021,"MOORHEAD, Minn. (AP) — Wreaths for each of the seven people whose bodies were discovered inside a Minnesota home over the weekend were left outside the residence Monday, where friends and relatives wept in below-freezing weather and wondered what happened to their loved ones. Preliminary autopsy results showed the victims who lived together in Moorhead did not die from “any obvious trauma,” but a cause of death has not been determined, police said. Relatives said they have more questions than answers. Moorhead police identified the victims as 37-year-old Belin Hernandez, 34-year-old Marleny Pinto, 32-year-old Eldor Hernandez Castillo, 19-year-old Mariela Guzman Pinto, 16-year-old Breylin Hernandez, 7-year-old Mike Hernandez and 5-year-old Marbely Hernandez. Alan Pinto, 14, a cousin who on Monday served as translator for his Spanish-speaking relatives, most of whom immigrated from Honduras, said the family was happy to be in America and to escape the turmoil of their home country. But they said their lives will never be the same after such a tragic loss. “I'm trying,” Pinto said, when asked how he was holding up. “It's hard.” Autopsies were conducted over the weekend by the Ramsey County Medical Examiner’s Office in St. Paul. Police said blood samples from the victims have been sent to a lab for further examination. “I know there is a lot of speculation in the community but our job is to look at all the facts,” Moorhead Capt. Deric Swenson told The Associated Press. “We have ideas about what happened but we don't have that specific answer.” The victims were found just before 8 p.m. Saturday by family members conducting a welfare check at the home in south Moorhead. Neighbors said the children were last seen Friday. There were no signs of violence or forced entry, police said. Authorities were not seeking suspects.

12/22/2021,"""The good from this is we've seen low-wage appreciation without the government having to come in and raise the minimum wage through more rules and regulations."" That's Republican Rep. James Comer of Kentucky's 1st Congressional District describing how the labor shortage is benefitting his state. As long as pay doesn't spiral out of control, Comer said the shortage can accomplish what Congress hasn't agreed on for 12 years: a new minimum wage. The labor shortage has been a nationwide phenomenon in 2021, but it's been especially intense in Kentucky. A first-of-its-kind report published in October indicated the state had the country's highest quits rate and one of its highest job-openings rates. Kentucky is still at the epicenter of the labor shortage months later, and the unusual hiring trends are expected to linger through 2022. Insider spoke with more than a dozen Kentuckians to uncover what's powering the shortage and how it could be solved, and spoke to representatives from both the Democratic and Republican sides of the aisle for the heavily conservative state. We also interviewed Comer's Democratic colleague John Yarmuth, the retiring chair of the House Budget Committee, whose district includes all of Louisville. Comer said the labor shortage could represent a turning point for his district's economy. Recent wage hikes ""probably needed to happen,"" he said, particularly for low-income areas. He also has strong thoughts on how the free market should solve unemployment, but it shouldn't be allowed to run so free that those wage hikes turn into an inflation crisis. Still, he said the state has has been in a ""workforce crisis for many years"" and bemoaned abuse of Social Security disability benefits. As his district borders Tennessee, he especially highlighted how intrastate rivalry weakens the job market. Like all members of the House, Comer is up for reelection in November 2022. Here's a transcript of Insider's interview with the representative on the labor shortage, Kentucky's hiring challenges, and how the tug-of-war between employers and employees is shaping up. The interview has been lightly edited for length. Kentucky's labor-force participation rate has been falling for most of the last two decades. What drove that, and to what extent has policy played a role? Kentucky has been in a workforce crisis for many years. One of the primary reasons is that there are certain pockets in and around Kentucky where a large percentage of the population in certain counties has been declared disabled. If you go back to when Bill Clinton supposedly reformed welfare in Kentucky, there was a big transition from welfare to disability. Being declared disabled became the new welfare. In Kentucky, the rules are lax — and they always have been — to be able to draw welfare and extended unemployment. The rules benefit the people who really want to game the system. (Editor's note: As of 2019, Kentucky was the state with the third-highest percentage of residents receiving disability benefits via Social Security, Insider calculated, whereas neighboring Tennessee was ranked eighth. Various studies support Comer's claim about disability aid, which is paid through the federal Social Security program.) Those unemployment programs got a pretty big boost during the pandemic. How has that affected already low workforce participation? It made a bad situation worse. Gov. Beshear totally botched the extended unemployment programs. Employers called our office every day complaining that they had called their employees back to work after that one- or two-week government shutdown and the workers wouldn't come back because they didn't have to. They could make as much money on unemployment as coming back to work. A lot of employees drew unemployment for nearly a year when in fact they should've drawn unemployment no longer than 10 days. It's always been abused. My district is on the Tennessee border. It's much harder for people to go in and draw unemployment in Tennessee than it is in Kentucky. If you drive through eastern Kentucky, every other billboard is an advertisement from a law firm telling you to call their number to be able to get on disability. It's an industry in certain counties in the state. It's a fraud that's developed into a massive industry. (Editor's note: Beneficiaries in Tennessee must provide ""detailed contact information"" for at least three prospective employers every week; Kentucky's program requires beneficiaries to report only one job contact each week.) When you talk to businesses in your district about how they're trying to hire during reopening, what have you been hearing? How has this jobs recovery been different? It's a dire situation. People assume it's just the low-wage restaurant workers or travel-industry workers. It's everyone. It's manufacturing. It's financial services. Even the construction industry. The biggest complaint was they didn't have as bad of a labor shortage before COVID, and once COVID happened and the federal government allowed for extended unemployment … people in Kentucky drew it as long as they could. It's just been real frustrating. Now some of these workers that gamed the unemployment system are starting to go back to work, and they've realized that there's such a shortage of workers that employers are offering sign-on bonuses. That's the next big problem that has faced a lot of employers. You've got a lot of musical chairs happening. You've got employees that are working somewhere until they get that sign-on bonus and then going to another place and getting another sign-on bonus. It's a civil war among Kentucky employers trying to hire and retain workers. The latest data points to the labor shortage lasting well into 2022. What will it take for that to end? As big as the labor shortage is in America now, there shouldn't be very many unemployment claims being paid out. I think the federal government should temporarily suspend the unemployment program, temporarily suspend any type of benefit it's given to people who can't find work. The Democrats in Washington have been talking about raising the minimum wage ... Well, the market has. Many of the workers we've been speaking to see this as something good in the economy, pointing out that they have more options and that the shortage is driving wages higher. Do you agree that there is some good coming from the labor shortage? The Democrats in Washington have been talking about raising the minimum wage, and conservatives would come back and say, ""Let the market determine the wage."" Well, the market has. You've seen a huge increase in pay for the low-wage jobs, which probably needed to happen for people to be able to work. The good from this is we've seen low-wage appreciation without the government having to come in and raise the minimum wage through more rules and regulations in the private sector. Something we've heard about from some Kentucky workers is the need for childcare support. What does Kentucky need to do to solve that problem? It's always been a huge challenge finding childcare. It's a challenge at my house. One of the things that made that a bigger challenge were the states and the counties that extended virtual learning and didn't have in-person learning. If the kid has to stay home from school, somebody has to watch them when there are no childcare options or people can't afford childcare. The shutdown of in-person learning in public education had a detrimental effect on the employment situation in Kentucky because parents had no choice but to leave the workforce and keep their young children at home. You mentioned that the labor shortage is the way for the market to solve the minimum-wage problem, but you've also raised concerns around people not returning to the workforce. Where do you think the middle ground between those two trends is? Hopefully the market will work itself out. It's a win for low-wage workers, because I don't know anywhere in my district now that's offering a beginning salary anywhere around minimum wage. Everything I know is at least 30% above minimum wage. McDonald's and the lowest of the low-wage jobs are now way past the minimum wage. I've always said that the minimum wage wasn't a living wage, especially if you're an adult and have a family. So this has been a help to a lot of low-wage workers in America. The problem when wages go up this much is it leads to inflation. We're seeing inflation every day. So a lot of the gains that low-wage workers are going to have are going to be offset and then some by increased inflation. Are there other hiring barriers in Kentucky that you think are ignored in the national conversation around the labor shortage? Kentucky is a very red state, and if you call my district, one of the biggest issues is border security. There's a huge disconnect on amnesty between the average Kentuckian and the employer. The employers want workers. They see all these people coming across the border illegally, and they see an opportunity to hire workers. The average worker in Kentucky is appalled that we don't have border security. So we get calls from employers wanting amnesty and wanting more H-2A workers. We got calls when they announced they were sending some of these Afghan refugees to Kentucky. Several employers called me and said, ""Do you think you could hook me up with somebody and see if I could use any of these people as workers?"" That's how desperate the employment situation is, that the employers are bucking the conventional wisdom in Kentucky with respect to amnesty and border security. My position is to secure the border, and I'm not supportive of amnesty. I am open to more H-2A and H-2B workers, because there's always been a shortage of workers in agriculture and construction and things like that. (Editor's note: H-2A visas are issued to foreign seasonal agriculture workers when US workers aren't available; H-2B visas are similar but pertain to industries outside of farming.) Has the average Kentuckian's stance changed on border security because of the labor shortage? They're opposed to amnesty and having any type of policy that would allow anyone in this country illegally to legally work somewhere. If you poll it, it's 99% in my district. The 1% that's open to it is the employers right now. It's that bad. What do you think the media's getting wrong about the labor shortage and the situation in Kentucky specifically? When I say there are too many people on disability, people go, ""Oh my God, that's politically incorrect!"" Kentucky has an industry to get people on disability who are very able-bodied. I don't think the media understands it. When they hear me say that, they think, ""Oh, that's a hard-hearted person."" But I'm the one member of Congress that grew up and still resides in Appalachia. So I have a broad section of the state, and I can tell you that's had as big an impact on the worker participation rate as anything. You've got counties in Kentucky with populations of 15,000 people that couldn't fill 25 jobs right now if a new industry moved in. One of the biggest reasons why is the disability industry. It's frustrating for me because most of my district is on the Tennessee state line and it's just very difficult to compete against Tennessee. They don't have an income tax. They have tighter unemployment rules, which leads to less fraud and cheating. They don't have a disability industry. I'll give you another example. Thirty percent of Kentucky is on Medicaid. Thirteen percent of Tennessee is on Medicaid. How in the world can two states that have everything in common have that big a difference? If you are eligible for Medicaid in Kentucky and you go to work, you'll lose your Medicaid. And there's no better health-insurance plan than Medicaid. These things sound hard-hearted. But if you really want to dive into the problem, it's the Medicaid systems abused in Kentucky, unemployment systems abused in Kentucky, and the SSI disability system abused in Kentucky. That is the reason we have the lowest worker-participation rate. Now, Yarmuth will disagree with that. Buddy, I am right, and he is wrong. (Editor's note: Kentucky adopted the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act that widened eligibility to any individual without insurance earning less than $17,609, and Tennessee did not.)

12/22/2021,"BOULDER, Colo. (AP) — Twenty-five years after JonBenet Ramsey was killed, police say DNA hasn’t been ruled out to help solve the case. The 6-year-old was found dead in the basement of her family’s Boulder home on Dec. 26, 1996, bludgeoned and strangled, several hours after her mother called 911 to say her daughter was missing and a ransom note had been left behind. Her death was ruled a homicide, but nobody was ever charged in the case. Boulder police have been working closely with state investigators on “future DNA advancements,"" the department said in a statement Monday addressing the anniversary of JonBenet’s death. “As the Department continues to use new technology to enhance the investigation, it is actively reviewing genetic DNA testing processes to see if those can be applied to this case moving forward,” it said.  In recent years, investigators have identified suspects in unsolved cases by comparing DNA profiles from crime scenes and to DNA testing results shared online by people researching their family trees, i ncluding the Golden State Killer in California. In Oregon earlier this year, a man was accused of killing two people who disappeared 20 years apart after forensic genealogy linked him to the 1999 disappearance and presumed death of one of them. Christopher Lovrien has pleaded not guilty to murder charges.   It's unclear if this is the method investigators plan to apply to the JonBenet case. A police spokesperson, Dionne Waugh, said she could not comment further because the investigation is still “active and ongoing.” Investigators have analyzed nearly 1,000 DNA samples during the course of the Ramsey investigation, police said in the statement, along with receiving, reviewing or investigating more than 21,016 tips, letters and emails. Detectives have traveled to 19 states to interview or speak with more than 1,000 people in connection with the case, the department said.  Tests in 2008 on newly discovered DNA on JonBenet’s clothing pointed to the involvement of an “unexplained third party” in her slaying, and not her parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, or their son, Burke. That led former district attorney Mary Lacy to clear the Ramseys of any involvement, two years after Patsy Ramsey died of cancer, calling the couple “victims of this crime.” The police department was criticized for its initial handling of the investigation into the death of JonBenet, who had competed in beauty pageants.  The details of the crime and video footage of JonBenet from the pageants propelled the case into one of the highest-profile mysteries in the United States, unleashing a series of true-crime books and TV specials.",U.S./Associated Press,Police won't rule out DNA to solve 1996 JonBenet killing,https://news.yahoo.com/police-eye-genetic-dna-25-191642322.html
