The move from Tuesday follows a successful trial, with the aim of connecting a letter with the digital world.  Customers can scan the barcodes in the Royal Mail app and will eventually be able to watch videos, information about services, or birthday messages and other greetings from senders. At the moment, a video featuring Shaun the Sheep, created exclusively for Royal Mail by the animation studio Aardman, can be viewed. It is the first in a series of planned videos to be released during 2022 that will allow customers sending stamped mail to choose which one the recipient can see when they receive an item of mail. The barcoded stamps will have a “digital twin” and the two will be connected by the Royal Mail app. The barcodes match the stamp colour and sit alongside the main body of the stamp, separated by a simulated perforation line. The barcodes will be available on so-called “definitive” stamps – the regular everyday stamps featuring the profile of the Queen. Non-barcoded definitive and Christmas stamps will remain valid until January 2023. Nick Landon, the Royal Mail chief commercial officer, said: “Introducing unique barcodes on our postage stamps allows us to connect the physical letter with the digital world and opens up the possibilities for a range of new innovative services in future.”",News/Business,Royal Mail adds barcodes to stamps offering digital extras,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/01/royal-mail-adds-barcodes-to-stamps-offering-digital-extras
2/1/2022,"The Swedes have rejected it, Dr Fauci says the US may soon approve it, the Chinese have started, but the Cubans have already vaccinated almost all young children against Covid. The island is the only country vaccinating toddlers as young as two against the disease, and more than 95% of two- to 18-year-olds have now been fully vaccinated, according to the ministry of public health.  “Although Covid hits children less severely, they are an important factor in transmission,” said Dr Gerardo Guillén, the lead developer of Abdala, one of the island’s homegrown vaccines. Child vaccination, one of the world’s highest Covid vaccination rates and high herd immunity after a massive Delta peak last summer, he said, have contributed to significantly lower infection rates in Cuba than in the US and Europe throughout the Omicron wave. With confidence in the community-based health service high – and with a one-party state preventing anti-vax movements from taking root as they have elsewhere in Latin America – Cubans by and large trust their country’s vaccines. Inoculating young children is widely seen as common sense. “Children are vaccinated as soon as they are born,” said Ania Ramírez, 33, collecting her fully vaccinated son, Fabio, age five, from school. “If he’s already got all the other vaccines, why wouldn’t I put this in him?” Around the world, Covid vaccination ages are getting lower: the World Health Organization has recommended that if high levels of coverage have already been achieved in the adult population, countries should consider inoculating children as young as five with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Chile and the United Arab Emirates are now vaccinating three-year-olds. But some countries are bucking the trend: the Swedish health agency last week decided against recommending Covid vaccines to children younger than 11, arguing there were no “clear benefits”. Experts say that there are benefits to vaccinating young children, but concerns remain. Dr Jon K Andrus, former regional immunization programme director at the Pan American Health Organisation and professor of public health at George Washington University, said that while Cuban scientists “make good quality vaccines”, he was wary of seeing children vaccinated before he had more information. “None of the results have been published in peer-reviewed journals, so it’s hard to discuss,” he said. Cuba’s vaccines, he said, are based on a platform “that has been used for decades on tetanus. It’s great technology, but you need the data because there might be an unexpected side-effect for this disease.” Cuban scientists say that phase I and II trials of Soberana 2 and Soberana Plus vaccines in 350 children aged between three and 18 found no serious adverse effects. Trial data, they say, has been sent to peer-review journals and is pending publication. Health officials say that in the coming weeks, all trial data will be sent to the World Health Organization, as they request export approvals. Dr Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, said that vaccination of young children “is essential” given the record number of kids in the US hospitalised with Omicron. But he emphasised the importance of strong public health communication. “The vaccine ecosystem is fragile,” he said. “If you get it wrong, especially with someone’s child, it can have spillover effects and derail other vaccine programmes.” He pointed to the Philippines, where a botched rollout of a new dengue vaccine in 2016 led to a widespread public perception that the vaccine was harmful. The consequence of that was a loss in public confidence in other child vaccines – resulting in a measles epidemic that killed hundreds. Dr Jerome Kim, director general of the International Vaccine Institute, a non-profit based in Seoul, said it “makes sense” to vaccinate young children, primarily to protect family members around them. “If the mum and dad are working, it’s often grandma and grandpa who take care of the child after school,” he said. He also emphasised the role that child vaccination can play in reducing poverty: data indicates that globally, for every dollar spent on vaccination, 44 dollars are saved in indirect costs. “It’s not only the direct cost of hospitalization that you save, but you save costs related to parents having to stay home,” he said.",News/World news,Cuba leads the world in vaccinating children as young as two against Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/01/cuba-leads-world-vaccinating-children
2/1/2022,"When Eddie Howe became Newcastle’s manager and was tasked with navigating a safe passage towards Premier League survival he swiftly realised there were two distinct routes out of the relegation zone. Both were hazardous but one offered infinitely greater scenic appeal and, ignoring some scary looking hairpin bends, Howe took it.  Rather than configuring Newcastle with a back three well drilled in low blocks and hoping that a possession-light side would remain reasonably adept at sneaking wins on the counterattack, he decided to start creating a front-foot, ball-monopolising, sweet-passing XI. Rafael Benítez and, more recently, Steve Bruce may have escaped a series of relegation skirmishes by playing with the handbrake on but the former Bournemouth manager was determined to channel his inner Kevin Keegan and do things differently. It helped that, unlike Benítez – still adored on Tyneside – and Bruce, he was not working for a penny-wise owner in the Mike Ashley mould but extraordinarily wealthy Saudi Arabian overlords determined to make the club the successful centrepiece of a wider exercise in the application of image altering geopolitical soft power or, as some see it, sportswashing. The only problem was that Howe did not possess sufficient players suited to his blueprint, has won only two of his 11 games since succeeding Steve Bruce and now needs his near-£90m transfer market spend to pay dividends. All that matters now is whether Bruno Guimarães, Kieran Trippier, Chris Wood, Dan Burn and the loanee Matt Targett can ensure Howe succeeds where Bruce, Steve McClaren and Alan Pardew all, to varying extents, failed. Despite working with very different sets of players the common denominator between those three managers is that, whenever they tried to wean Newcastle off the counterattacking that has, for more than a decade, been the team’s default style, they ran into significant problems. Benítez, well aware he lacked the requisite midfielders to create, control and sustain a passing rhythm, did not even try, preferring to refine the team’s ability on the break. Howe finally possesses a choreographer capable of becoming a cornerstone around which to base Newcastle’s rebuild. Brazil’s Guimarães, a dynamic defensive midfielder, has signed from Lyon for an initial fee in the region of £35m and the speed of the 24-year-old’s adaptation to English football will very possibly determine if and when Newcastle will escape the bottom three. Guimarães, often described as a “complete midfielder”, honed his craft on futsal courts, rarely forfeits possession and is adapt at retaining it in the tightest of tight spots. Much has, quite rightly, been made of Newcastle’s primary weakness being in central defence but a big part of the problem has been the lack of a protective quasi-sweeper anchoring midfield. Guimarães is not dubbed the “Piano Carrier” for nothing and his enforcement abilities could yet make Jamaal Lascelles and co look an infinitely better back four than they have often appeared this season. Much, though, hinges on both how Howe’s new boys gel and how those club stalwarts Bruce privately claimed Benítez had “brainwashed” into a cagey counterattacking mindset adjust to the change in managerial vision. The volte face in recruitment philosophy has been even more radical. It is impossible to envisage Ashley spending £25m on the 30-year-old Wood, £13m on the 29-year-old Burn and a fee potentially rising to £15m for the 31-year-old Trippier. Ashley was consistently reluctant to acquire players over 25 because of their lack of resale potential but this policy frequently left the team light on experience and leadership and Newcastle were twice relegated on his watch. Should survival be secured, the Saudis will, justifiably, claim the so called “Newcastle tax” was well worth paying to Burnley, Brighton and Atlético Madrid. Although Burn has regularly been rotated at Brighton he has recently been in the form of his career and the 6ft 7in boyhood Newcastle fan may prove one of this month’s most inspired purchases, helping assuage Howe’s pain at missing out on his first-choice defensive targets, Lille’s Sven Botman and Sevilla’s Diego Carlos. Yet if Wood provides essential attacking cover for the injured Callum Wilson, Newcastle’s principal striker, while also weakening Burnley, Howe could yet have cause to pine for the two gamechanging forwards that got away, namely the exciting Reims teenager Hugo Ekitike and Manchester United’s Jesse Lingard. Trippier, a right-back still harbouring England ambitions, already looks a future Newcastle captain; which begs the question of the potential effect on the team’s ecosystem should Howe drop the holder of the armband, Lascelles, to create room for Burn. Given Lascelles can be pretty feisty, the manager may need to locate his inner diplomat. At left-back Targett should offer the sort of width and crosses Howe craves. His presence also creates competition in an over-stocked squad but the manager’s challenge now is to ensure that a decent team on paper pick up points on the pitch. If not, he will surely lose his beauty contest with Watford’s Roy Hodgson, Burnley’s Sean Dyche, Norwich’s Dean Smith, Everton’s Frank Lampard et al and Benítez’s name may once again be mentioned as the solution to Newcastle’s woes. It is no exaggeration to say the next few months could make or break Howe’s career.",Sport/Football,Eddie Howe must show the Newcastle transfer tax was worth paying,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/01/eddie-howe-must-show-the-newcastle-transfer-tax-was-worth-paying
2/1/2022,"About 7,000 homes remain without power in northern Scotland and the north-east of England, with dozens of schools closed for another day, as the effort to clear up after Storms Malik and Corrie continues. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) was at red alert status after the storms cut power to 117,000 customers in Scotland, with restorations hampered by continuing high winds.  On Monday night it had restored electricity to 100,000 households and hoped to reduce the number of customers off-supply to 7,000 overnight. Restoration efforts would continue into Tuesday, the firm said, with the possibility that “small clusters” of customers – largely in rural Aberdeenshire and the Angus border, as well as parts of Perthshire, the Highlands, Western Isles and the Moray Coast – may not have power until Wednesday. The timing would depend on the extent of damage found and the potential impact on safe working conditions in higher winds forecast for Tuesday, SSEN said, after the Met Office issued a yellow warning for wind. Many schools in the affected areas were unable to open because of lack of power and heating, including 37 in Aberdeenshire, seven in the Highlands and six in Angus. In the north-east of England, 61 homes remained cut off on Monday night, according to Northern Powergrid. After the storms, 80,000 customers in the region lost supply, the firm said. Andy Bilclough, its director of field operations, said on Monday night: “Our teams have got through a phenomenal amount of work today, which includes reconnecting around 17,000 customers that were impacted by Storm Corrie, and they are still out there now. “Almost all of the work we have left to do is a blend of repair work that we discovered when we got to site, some difficult conditions that meant we could not complete the work today, or where we would have needed access to the property during the night but have agreed with the customer to complete the restoration tomorrow.” Richard Gough, the director of distribution system operations at SSEN, said: “While our teams are making every effort to restore customers as soon as possible, the cumulative impact of Storm Malik and Storm Corrie has compounded the restoration challenge. “As a result, we are advising customers that while expected restoration of customer supplies from Storm Malik remains Tuesday evening, restoration times for some of those impacted by Storm Corrie may now extend to Wednesday.”",News/UK news,Thousands remain without power after Storms Malik and Corrie,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/01/thousands-without-power-storms-malik-corrie-scotland-england
2/1/2022,"Dacia Torchia tries to avoid her basement. Especially when the foul, familiar smell creeps under the door just off the kitchen. She knows what’s waiting for her at the bottom of the dark stairway. “I’m in a state of denial. Like if I don’t go downstairs, I don’t have to deal with it,” said Torchia, 55, a single mother who owns a century-old house at the bottom of a hill in Mount Vernon, New York. After heavy rains, her basement sometimes floods with dark, sludgy wastewater – eight inches on bad days.  Torchia isn’t alone. Like many residents in Mount Vernon, she is unclear about whether underlying weaknesses in her plumbing are her problem alone, or whether the city bears some responsibility. Over the years, she said, four private plumbers have diagnosed different causes for her sanitation woes. But their suggested fixes were all too expensive. Instead Torchia opts for cheaper, temporary measures – and then braces herself until the next flood. This majority-Black town on the outskirts of New York City has a long history of sewage problems. Until recently, Mount Vernon has said it can’t afford to fix the infrastructure failures that are polluting rivers and flooding homes. The situation was symbolic, experts said, of how many lower-income or Black communities are locked in a vicious cycle: they lack basic municipal infrastructure and are unable to pay for the problems that result. They are precisely the kind of community that the Biden administration had said would benefit from sweeping infrastructure and wastewater investments. But officials in Mount Vernon now say they’re optimistic about the city’s sewage crisis. Damani Bush, the city’s public works commissioner, said the Guardian’s reporting last year “set fire” to the case, and helped draw renewed state and federal interest in solving the city’s sanitation problems. After a series of meetings with environmental oversight agencies, the city has unlocked $10m in grant funding that would target areas where its pipes are known to be leaking sewage into the environment. Officials called it the biggest grant the city has received in recent memory. “I think the sky is starting to clear a little bit,” said Mount Vernon Mayor Shawyn Patterson-Howard. “It’s not a full sunny day yet. We have a long way to go.” The money is a start – it’s still only a fraction of the help Mount Vernon needs. What’s left to be seen is how much the grant helps, and how long before families like the Tochias can expect to see relief. Located in Westchester county, just north of New York City, Mount Vernon sits next door to some of the wealthiest enclaves in the US. The county’s median household income was more than $100,000 in 2019, versus less than $60,000 for Mount Vernon. Mount Vernon also has the most Black residents of any city in Westchester; in the mid-20th century, thousands of Black residents who had been displaced from surrounding cities through urban renewal policies settled in Mount Vernon, which today has a population of 74,000. Nearly a decade ago, the federal Environmental Protection Agency discovered that untreated human waste from Mount Vernon was spilling into the Bronx and Hutchinson Rivers, which border the city and flow south toward the Bronx. Twice, once in 2014 and then again in 2016, the agency ordered Mount Vernon to address the overflows, but the city failed to comply. In 2020, the EPA – together with the state of New York – sued Mount Vernon. City officials estimate that overhauling Mount Vernon’s crumbling sewage infrastructure could cost between $100mand $200m. City officials also are still determining the scope of the problem, and estimate that about 1,000 households are vulnerable to sewage backups. Some residents say they’ve had problems flushing their toilets for decades. Last summer, the New York state Department of Environmental Conservation began working with the city to help unlock funding for infrastructure fixes, according to Bush. In December, the agency awarded the city a $10m grant to fix two sewage outfalls along the Hutchinson River, where local environmental researchers have recorded off-the-charts levels of fecal bacteria. The city still needs more funding, manpower and equipment to completely satisfy all the orders. But officials say the grant signals a new phase of the sewage crisis, where oversight agencies work with the city instead of punishing it. “The water infrastructure challenges confronting Mount Vernon are simply enormous,” said DEC Commissioner Basil Seggos, who is listed as one of the parties suing Mount Vernon over its sewage pollution. He says state regulators plan to collaborate with Mount Vernon on solutions moving forward. As the city continues to lobby for cash assistance, ithas had to find temporary fixes to stop homes from flooding. About a year ago, it installed a bypass pump in the middle of a busy street in a densely populated neighborhood. The device, which runs 16 hours a day, looks like an oversized power generator hooked up to an open manhole, and the smell of sewage is strong. Residents hate walking near it. But if it stops working, hundreds of nearby families would immediately notice problems with their plumbing, city officials said. Last year, Mount Vernon’s six-man sewer crew responded to hundreds of emergency backups, while also performing court-ordered repairs. “We’ve completed more work in the last eight months than we have in the last 10 years,” said Bush, who has served as public works commissioner since 2020. But his crew keeps finding new weak points in the system as they try to fix old ones. “Every street has its own problem. It’s a lot,” Bush added. Cities can bounce back from catastrophic infrastructure failures – it’s happened before. The combined sewer network in Washington DC once discharged a staggering amount of untreated waste into the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers with every rain. In 2005, the city agreed to install massive tunnels deep underground that would reduce overflows by 96%. The project, one of the largest of its kind, is still under construction, 16 years later. The cost: $2.7bn and counting. Yet the effort earned DC good marks for wastewater in June, when the American Society of Civil Engineers last evaluated the city’s infrastructure. Mount Vernon’s sewage network services just 4.4 sq miles, a fraction of Washington DC’s footprint. And the historic $1.2tn bipartisan infrastructure package could bring significant relief to the city’s ailing pipes: This year, the EPA will direct $428m for water and sewage infrastructure into New York state’s drinking water and clean water state revolving funds. The EPA has promised to give priority to under-resourced cities, as part of the plan. The agency says it already has been working with Mount Vernon on its sewage crisis and will continue to seek new solutions, despite its litigation with the city. New York Senator Chuck Schumer, a proponent of the infrastructure package, has advocated on behalf of Mount Vernon in Washington and said through a spokesperson that he will help funding flow toward the city. “Senator Schumer will continue to work in lockstep with his federal, state and local partners to ensure the funding he secured gets to Mount Vernon and will continue to fight for more until the city has the sewer system they’ve long desired and deserved,” said Schumer spokesperson Allison Biasotti. Commissioner Bush said he’ll continue lobbying agencies at every level of government to make sure Mount Vernon gets “its fair share of the pie” from the infrastructure package. The city badly needs funding for roads and bridges – sewage is hardly the only problem area, Bush noted. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” he said. “If we don’t go for this now, there won’t be another shot.”",News/US news,‘Every street has its own problem’: majority Black city sees hope after years of sewage crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/01/mount-vernon-new-york-sewage-crisis-hope-progress-water
2/1/2022,"The disruption that has blighted England’s buildup must be seen in the context of the size of the player pool available to Eddie Jones, but the fact that more than half the backs in the training squad – not to mention a handful of forwards – have never played in the Six Nations demonstrates the uncertainty with which their campaign begins.  On one hand, it gives Jones the chance to assess inexperienced players in the heat of battle but on the other England finished fifth last year and a repeat in 2022 would leave the Rugby Football Union running short of excuses as to why it should continue to back him. Jones is having to strike the right balance, then, but there is optimism and excitement about his “New England” following uplifting autumn victories, notably over South Africa. Much of that comes from the anticipation that greets Marcus Smith’s every touch and the excellence of Freddie Steward but how those two, and other callow members of the side, perform when the rain is coming in sideways at Murrayfield could define England’s tournament. A trip to Rome follows and England could be sitting pretty with two wins from two and bolstered by the expected return of Manu Tuilagi and, maybe, Joe Launchbury. Defeat, however, puts England under the pump from the onset. Player to watch Alex Dombrandt. With no Sam Underhill in the squad, you’d expect Tom Curry to move to flanker, meaning an opening at No 8. Sam Simmonds is in good form but Dombrandt is the coming man. Key match The trip to France on the final weekend could be a mouth-watering decider but this weekend in Murrayfield feels so important for England’s fortunes. They start as favourites and there is undoubtedly a sense that now is the time for France to turn all of the progress they have made under Fabien Galthié into tangible success after consecutive second-place finishes. Covid problems in the Top14 have hampered preparations somewhat but, ominously for the rest of the competition, the vast majority of the players affected, including Antione Dupont, have now returned to the squad. There may be an element of rust but it helps that France start off against Italy, and provided there are not any long-lasting effects, it is easy to see why they are so well fancied. The depth of talent is frankly outrageous and Eddie Jones has made repeated reference to how Galthié is able to select 42 players at the start of every week and keep 28 with him throughout. Jones was no doubt attempting to turn the pressure up a notch but evidently France are now reaping the rewards of the improved alignment between club and country that has them on track for a home World Cup in 2023. The public are engaged again and a long-awaited victory over New Zealand in the autumn showed that les bleus can operate at a level above their Six Nations rivals. How they handle the expectation will likely determine their fate. Player to watch Melvyn Jaminet. The fullback has been a revelation since a surprise call-up for last summer’s tour of Australia. A reliable goal-kicker to boot. Key match France triumphed on their last trip to Cardiff but they do not win at the Principality stadium often. Repeat the feat in round four and they should be in the hunt going into the final round. Ticking along very nicely under Andy Farrell, whose decision to step aside from the British & Irish Lions last summer was proved a shrewd one last autumn when the manner of their victory over New Zealand – just as much as the scoreline – demanded attention. Under Joe Schmidt, Ireland were at their best when overwhelming opponents with their power and physicality and they seem to be doing so again with Farrell at the helm. The signs were there when thumping England in the last round of the championship last year and Ireland arrive at the starting line without the injury headaches afflicting some of their rivals. They are, as always, a Johnny Sexton injury away from a national crisis but they have not lost at home to Wales in the Six Nations for a decade and the form of the provinces is another cause for optimism. Trips to Paris and Twickenham suggest Ireland should struggle in even years but they won the grand slam in 2018 and while a clean sweep may not be on the cards this year – given how competitive the championship is – squeeze past France in round two and they will take some stopping. Player to watch Hugo Keenan. He looked a little out of his depth when first coming into the side in 2020 but has blossomed and is in supreme form for Leinster. Key match The last eight championship matches between France and Ireland have been decided by a score or less and their round two encounter is likely to be similarly tight. Thirty-two championship defeats and counting – a run that dates back to 2015 and is not expected to change any time soon. Progress will have to be measured in how close they can keep losing margins and while they will probably produce a 40-minute showing that gives one of their opponents a fright, there is no evidence to suggest anything but another wooden spoon. The trouble for Italy is that, whatever incremental improvements they make, it seems their rivals are getting better – as shown in the autumn when the southern hemisphere big three were all beaten by European opponents on the same weekend for the first time since 2002. It is, at least, another five matches in which to develop young players such as Paolo Garbisi, Federico Mori and the captain Michele Lamaro but the relegation question will not go away, whatever the Six Nations chief executive Ben Morel says. He has a point when he refers to more obvious progress at age-grade level but you have to wonder if an extreme option like placing selection restrictions – a limited number over the age of 23 for example – on their opponents might be better for all concerned. Still, at least the sun should be out in Rome. Player to watch Paolo Garbisi. The obvious choice but the fact he is keeping Handré Pollard out of the Montpellier side shows his class. Sergio Parisse also falls into this category if he features. Key match It’s a fool who bets against five defeats but here’s hoping they can start off with a positive performance in their opening match in Paris. There are many things to like about Scotland at the moment, from the coaching excellence of Gregor Townsend and his assistants to the genius of Finn Russell, while in Stuart Hogg they have a captain who is consistently striking the right tone. His anger at how France’s potential margin of victory was the chief talking point before the postponed finale a year ago might have backfired, instead it galvanised Scotland into a performance and a win that establishes them as genuine contenders this time around. And Hogg is not afraid to embrace that label. We can but hope that this week’s Scotland v England buildup is not dominated by both sides kicking around the favourites’ tag because now is the time for Scotland to welcome the fact they are well fancied for the tournament. Townsend has a relatively injury-free squad to pick from, Cameron Redpath has made a timely return, and a third win over England in five years would set them up well. Rivals will no doubt be studying their disappointing autumn defeat by South Africa but there are a number of unmissable matches on paper this year, and most of them involve Scotland. Player to watch Kyle Rowe. Uncapped winger showed his potential with a hat-trick for London Irish against Saracens this season. Was previously part of the sevens set-up, put on furlough and took a job in an Amazon warehouse to make ends meet. Key match The Calcutta Cup is hugely significant but equally so is how Scotland fare on their travels and it would be incredibly frustrating if they fail in Cardiff, having opened up with a win over England. All the signs suggest a difficult championship for Wales but they have won grand slams when starting off in similar circumstances and though they are badly hit by injuries, Wayne Pivac can still select a first-choice XV to slug it out with the very best. They began their autumn campaign poorly, with a sloppy performance against the All Blacks, but improved thereafter and November form has never been a bellwether for Wales’s fortunes in the Six Nations anyway. Dan Biggar is a shrewd choice as captain, provided he does not get on the wrong side of the officials, and do not underestimate the effect a full house at the Principality stadium will have. Wales may end up being a gallop or two short in the title race but given they host Scotland and France they are likely to have a big say in who is ultimately crowned champions. They may even have Alun Wyn Jones back before the end of the tournament too – the embodiment of why you write Wales off at your peril. Player to watch Adam Beard. Deemed surplus to requirements by Wayne Pivac not long ago but was a late call-up by the Lions, then made the bench in the third Test and is now Wales vice-captain. Key match They rarely triumph in Ireland but this year, perhaps more than most, you sense Wales need a winning start given how stretched resources are already.

2/1/2022,"With a crucial vote pending over filibuster rules that would have made strong voting rights legislation feasible, Democratic senator Kyrsten Sinema flew into Houston, Texas, for a fundraiser that drew dozens of fossil fuel chieftains, including Continental Resources chairman Harold Hamm and ConocoPhillips chief executive Ryan Lance. The event was held on 18 January at the upmarket River Oaks Country Club. One executive told the Guardian that Sinema spoke for about half an hour and informed a mostly Republican crowd that they could “rest assured” she would not back any changes with filibuster rules, reiterating a stance she took several days before during a Senate speech.  The Arizona senator also addressed some energy industry issues according to the executive, who added that overall he was “tremendously impressed”. The day after the Houston bash, Sinema voted against changing filibuster rules, thereby helping to thwart the voting rights bill. The Houston gusher of fossil fuel donations for Sinema from many stalwart Republican donors underscores how pivotal she has become, along with West Virginia Democratic senator Joe Manchin, in an evenly divided Senate involving high-stakes battles for Republican and fossil fuel interests. Campaign finance watchdogs say that the Houston fundraiser reveals much about Sinema’s aggressive efforts to capitalize on her Senate power on matters ranging from climate change to taxes to the filibuster rule. “Sinema isn’t up for re-election this year, but she’s fundraising full-tilt,” Sheila Krumholz, the executive director of OpenSecrets, told the Guardian. “By her comment to oil-industry attendees last week, she clearly knew her vote to protect the filibuster would please them.” The Houston fundraiser, which was expected to raise tens of thousands of dollars for the senator’s campaign coffers, offers a stark example of how Sinema has been courting major Republican donors and special interests who, in turn, seem to be increasingly eager to help her. Sinema’s drive to rope in more big Republican donors was also apparent at a September fundraiser in Dallas at the $18m home of G Brint Ryan, a prominent Republican donor and CEO of a global consulting company, who hosted another money bash last year for Manchin. Sinema’s stance against changing filibuster rules has also won her support from other top Republican donors such as Stan Hubbard, a Minnesota billionaire broadcaster who gave her $2,900 last September, which reportedly was the first donation he made to a Democrat since 2019. Hubbard told the Guardian that her opposition to the filibuster was a crucial reason he donated, adding that it would “be terrible to get rid of the filibuster”, and that he thought voting rights were “just fine”, without passing a Democrat-backed bill to protect them. Little wonder that voting rights advocates were dismayed by Sinema’s staunch opposition to any changes with the filibuster. “We are very disappointed that Senator Sinema has put formalistic rules over protecting our democracy,” said Danielle Lang, the senior director of voting rights at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. Sinema’s position on the filibuster rule has sparked anger among liberal backers such as the powerful group Emily’s List, which endorses Democratic women who support abortion rights. One week after Sinema gave a floor speech indicating that she wouldn’t support altering filibuster rules, Emily’s List publicly stated that the group would no longer endorse her. In her floor speech backing the filibuster rule, Sinema touted the need for more bipartisanship, stressing that she would not “support separate actions that worsen the underlying disease of division infecting our country”. But Sinema’s vote and speech only spurred more criticism in Arizona where the state Democratic party issued a rare censure in the wake of her continued support for the filibuster. Arizona’s Democratic party chair Raquel Teran has stated that the vote was a “result of her failure to do whatever it takes to ensure the health of our democracy”. More broadly, Democratic angst about Sinema was highlighted by a January tracking poll before her filibuster vote that showed just 8% of registered Arizona Democrats had a favorable view of the Senator. The recent poll reflects a steep drop from the 70% positive rating the Senator had in 2020. Her declining popularity also has been spurred by the senator’s voting against raising the federal minimum wage, and skipping a Senate vote to create a bipartisan commission to investigate the January 6 mob attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters. Sinema has also drawn brickbats from Democrats for her unwillingness last month to endorse the House passed Build Back Better legislation that she and Manchin were instrumental in whittling down from the measure’s original size, while accelerating their fundraising outreach to rightwing donors and lobbyists. Sinema told Democratic senators according to the New York Times that she was opposed to any tax increases in personal rates or corporate rates to pay for the bill, which included approximately $550bn for clean energy and climate change measures, a crucial part of President Joe Biden’s agenda. Leftwing Vermont senator Bernie Sanders was especially irked when both Sinema and Manchin joined all the Senate Republicans in blocking the filibuster rule change, saying that they “forced us to go through five months of discussions which have gotten absolutely nowhere”, and indicating he might support primary challengers to both senators. Veteran Arizona Republican consultant Chuck Coughlin noted that Sinema “clearly understands the electoral position she is in, and is using this opportunity to raise as much as she can in order to make challenging her a herculean task – whether she runs as a Democrat or an independent.” Coughlin’s analysis seems on target based on the very robust $4.4m that Sinema’s campaign had in the bank at the end of September. Charlie Black, a longtime Republican operative and lobbyist, added that “Sinema’s gotten a lot of support from the business community, including both Republicans and Democrats.” Still, with Democratic attacks on Sinema increasing, the odds are good that if she opts to run again in 2024 she will have a primary opponent, perhaps Congressman Ruben Gallego, who has publicly suggested he might challenge her, and knocked the senator over her filibuster vote. A group called the Primary Sinema Project that began last summer has raised at least $330,000, including $100,000 during the week after her filibuster speech. Sinema’s drive to raise big bucks early seems to be underscored by the jump last year in donations from fossil fuel interests, according to campaign finance data. Last year, Sinema hauled in $24,310 from fossil fuel donors compared with just $7,522 the year before, according to OpenSecrets. Although there’s no data yet on how much Sinema raised in Houston, a veteran fossil fuel lobbyist told the Guardian that donors at such fundraisers are often asked to pony up the maximum of $5,800 to the senator’s campaign committee, and write another check for as much as $5,000 to the senator’s leadership Pac. For Krumholz of OpenSecrets, the Houston fundraiser offers a broader message. “The timing of the fundraiser and Sinema’s filibuster-protecting vote really puts a fine point on the return on investment for her donors.” Krumholz added that the fossil fuel fundraiser “seems well timed as Congress revisits the $550bn BBB measure focused on climate change provisions, where her vote could help industry minimize new regulatory and tax burdens.”",News/Business,Kyrsten Sinema courted Republican fossil fuel donors with filibuster stance,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/01/kyrsten-sinema-courted-republican-fossil-fuel-donors-filibuster-stance
2/1/2022,"‘How many times have you broken your back?” A concerned-looking doctor is asking a jockey. It takes him a few seconds to count. “Three … I think.” The doctor, it turns out, is a vet; the jockey, who’s in his 40s, hasn’t got the cash for medical treatment so slips the racetrack vet a few dollars for an X-ray. It’s a scene typical of this macho-sentimental feature debut from Clint Bentley, which trots a well-trod narrative: the past-his-peak athlete clutching at one last chance of glory before the knacker’s yard. It’s a movie that gets by (and then some) on an intense and focused performance by character actor Clifton Collins Jr, and a truthful-feeling sense of place. Collins plays the jockey: Jackson Silva is solid and decent, a man of few words and well-respected on the circuit. Racing has taken its toll on his body: he’s numb down one side and has got the shakes in his crop holding hand. Still, Jackson is convinced he’s got a couple of years left in him. He’s worked for some time with trainer Ruth (a warm and generous performance by Molly Parker), who has just bought an exceptional young thoroughbred. Another movie would have required a romance between Jackson and Ruth; but here the pair only have eyes for their horse. (“She’s like a swan with teeth,” Jackson marvels).  Director Bentley is the son of a jockey and shot the movie at a scruffy racetrack in Phoenix, casting real-life jockeys alongside professional actors. And he really gets under the skin of this world, its way of life, rhythms and textures – though I found the subplot involving a young jockey (Moises Arias) sniffing around asking questions about Jackson a bit predictable. However, there’s a brilliant scene where jockeys sit around at the end of the day trading tales of past injuries like army veterans. It says something about Collins’ lived-in performance that his lined, creased face fits right in. He is surely entitled to put his years as a character actor behind him.  Jockey is released on 4 February in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Jockey review – a sentimental movie that trots a well-trod narrative,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/01/jockey-review-a-sentimental-movie-that-trots-a-well-trod-narrative
2/1/2022,"In the final days of Theresa May’s premiership, the UK’s net-zero target, like the landmark 2008 Climate Change Act before it, entered the statute book with hardly any resistance. Well-founded complaints were made that it did not match the pace and scale required to address climate breakdown, but, as in 2008, across parliament there appeared to be an underlying consensus that “something had to be done”. Outright climate-change denial was kept to a faint background hum.  Now, however, this consensus seems to be falling apart. Behind the scenes, a faction of Tory MPs is manoeuvring, Brexit-style, to systematically undermine the government’s stated climate efforts. With the Conservative party in meltdown, it looks like Britain’s net-zero policy is becoming just another political football to be kicked around the government backbenches. Make no mistake, the UK government’s current stance on the climate falls gravely short of what’s needed. The “something” that must be done has always been a matter of contentious debate, with activists and experts despairing at Tory inadequacy. The Johnson government is hailed as world-leading in setting targets, but accused of only paying lip service to – rather than ensuring real policy dividends for – decarbonisation efforts. But the newly formed Net Zero Scrutiny Group (NZSG) is launching an attack from the other end of the political spectrum. It reportedly has around 18 members in the Commons and is being run by dissident MPs Steve Baker and Craig Mackinlay, a Tory MP who was once the deputy leader of Ukip. This is hardly the first time that small Tory factions have organised to upend a whole political agenda. The NZSG appears to be modelled on the European Research Group – also chaired by Baker – whose membership in the years leading up to the EU referendum never exceeded 26 MPs, but who successfully changed the shape of European politics. Just as with Brexit, Baker is gunning for an “enormous political explosion” around net zero. The group rejects the characterisation that they are climate sceptics. Their focus is on blaming climate policy for the cost-of-living crisis, particularly soaring energy bills. They take climate “delayism” to extremes, not only arguing that we can act later, but that government should support the further exploitation of fossil fuels. Via the hashtag #CostofNetZero, members associated with the group have been making interventions across the media, calling to shelve the green levy on energy bills (which pays for insulation for those in fuel poverty and subsidises renewable energy). This totally mischaracterises the energy crisis – which is ultimately a cost-of-gas crisis, meaning major corporations have reaped billions in profits. When we should be doubling down on climate measures, such as insulation and renewable energy, as well as a windfall tax on fossil fuel companies, the NZSG is pulling lines straight out of the climate denial playbook: spreading easily refutable claims about the cost of renewables and future of fossil fuels. Their alternative solutions to the gas crisis? Antiquated proposals such as drilling for more North Sea oil and gas while bemoaning the phasing out of coal. Ultimately, anyone advocating for the continued use of oil and gas does not understand the threat that climate breakdown poses. This climate cost conspiracy is being manufactured by both internal Tory agitators and the usual suspects on the populist right. Although Nigel Farage has “retired” from politics, he is throwing his weight behind the latest incarnation of the Brexit party, Reform UK. In a piece for the Telegraph earlier this month, he wrote about Reform’s lines of attack. Two of the three are familiar: Brexit and the arrival of asylum seekers. But the third is new – the net-zero strategy, he says, is supposedly placing the UK at “a significant disadvantage”. We underestimate the Net Zero Scrutiny Group at our peril. These seemingly small configurations can hugely influence policy. Tiny cracks of “climate scepticism” have the ability to activate huge rifts in attempts to limit temperature rises to 2C. Things are so bad that “greener” MPs in the Tory party have been forced to speak out. In a direct challenge to his colleagues, Chris Skidmore has set up a “Net Zero Support Group” to keep climate hopes alive; Alok Sharma has cautioned against delayed action on climate change; while Nick Fletcher and Richard Graham have written in favour of net zero. But there is yet to be a proper crackdown on climate delayism inside the governing party. This is all compounded by the current fragility of Boris Johnson’s position. The prime minister’s perceived proximity to the net-zero strategy could mean MPs (such as those in the 100-strong Conservative Environment Network) are nervous to come out and make a strong case for net zero, lest it appear to be a vote of confidence in Johnson at this febrile time. And the two frontrunners to replace him – Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss – have questionable green credentials at best. Johnson’s fall from power could represent an opportunity to make sure the UK’s decarbonisation strategy falls off the priority list altogether. Only recently, the Treasury floated that it is reviewing the green levy on energy bills, a move that could be read as Sunak throwing a bone to the NZSG. The electorate care about climate breakdown, with concern at an all-time high last November during Cop26. But without rigorous myth-busting around the cause of high gas prices, and interventions that tackle the cost of living and emissions at the same time, the supposed “cost of net zero” could breed popular resentment that sets tackling the climate crisis even further back. Activists and opposition parties should beware – we could be entering an era in which we are not just pushing to transform promises into action, but battling to get climate on to the agenda at all.

2/1/2022,"Boris Johnson has been challenged by a Conservative backbencher to commit at the dispatch box to publishing the full report on Downing Street parties, as his deputy, Dominic Raab, said it was “unclear” if there was further evidence to come. Mark Harper, a former Conservative chief whip, told the Guardian that he had asked Johnson to reiterate at Wednesday’s PMQs his promise – made in private to MP colleagues – to publish the full report.  The prime minister had originally declined to do so when asked by Harper in the Commons during his statement on Gray’s update. On Tuesday, Raab, the justice secretary, appeared to row back on commitments made by Johnson to publish further evidence once the Metropolitan police investigation into 12 separate events in Downing Street has concluded. Speaking to LBC, Raab said: “It’s not clear to me that there is anything more, other than any conclusions that she will draw once that investigation is concluded, that will come forward.” In an update published on Monday, Gray said she had “extensive factual information” including speaking to at least 70 people – which could not be published until the Met had finished its investigation. She said she had declined to publish details of several other events that were not under investigation, in order not to skew the findings. “I will secure storage and safekeeping of all the information gathered until such time as it may be required further,” she wrote. The police are examining about 300 photographs as part of the investigation into alleged parties. Raab told Sky News it was a “good question” why there were so many pictures of gatherings that were claimed to be work events. He told Times Radio that he believed Johnson was safe from a Tory leadership challenge. “On the specific issues Sue Gray cited, I think he has addressed all of those questions in a fulsome way and, frankly, at the political level, my experiences in the chamber but also at the meeting of Conservative MPs – overwhelmingly MPs backing him, wanting to see us getting on with the job,” he said. Most Conservative MPs said they would continue to reserve judgment on the prime minister until the police had concluded their inquiries. But Andrew Mitchell, a former international development secretary, said it was already doing “very great damage to the party”. He added: “It is more corrosive in my judgment than the expenses scandal was and it will break the coalition that is the Conservative party. “I think the problem is that Boris is running a modern government like a medieval court. You need to rule and govern through the structures, through Whitehall, through the cabinet for national security council. “Many of us thought he would govern in the way he did when he was mayor of London, through being a chairman of a board, running a very good team – that is not what has happened here.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson under fresh pressure to publish full Gray report,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/01/boris-johnson-pressure-publish-gray-report-raab
2/1/2022,"Scott Morrison has kicked the political year off with an address to the National Press Club after which he faced a barrage of questions about the government’s handling of the pandemic and poor standing in the opinion polls. Politicians often answer the question they wish they’d been asked – not the one that was actually asked – and Morrison’s Q&A was a classic of the genre.  So where did Morrison’s answers fall short? The ABC’s Laura Tingle asked if the prime minister would like to “take this opportunity to actually say sorry for the mistakes you’ve made as prime minister”. Morrison replied: “We’re all terribly sorry for what this pandemic has done to the world and to this country.” See what he did there? He shifted the apology from its intended subject – his mistakes – and on to something arguably outside his control. Earlier, Morrison had said accepting responsibility means to challenge yourself with questions like “couldn’t this have been avoided”. In answer to Tingle, Morrison admitted being too optimistic about the summer and said he wished he’d sent in the military to fix the vaccination rollout sooner. But asked again if he would apologise, sorry seemed the hardest word. “I think I’ve explained my answer fairly fully,” he said. Guardian Australia’s Katharine Murphy asked why errors keep being made in the handling of outbreaks in aged care, resulting in more than 400 deaths since January. Morrison replied that by now 99% of aged care centres had been visited and residents offered booster shots, then filibustered by giving statistics about personal protective equipment. Nothing about the settings in place before those deaths, when many residents were still not boosted. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Seven Network’s Mark Riley asked why the Morrison government wouldn’t join a Fair Work Commission case in which unions are seeking a pay rise in the sector. Morrison responded by attacking Labor for promising to do so without saying how it would fund any increase ordered. Morrison said: “There’s a process under way, and we will let that process follow its course. And we’ll, of course, have to absorb any decision that is taken there.” So, aged care workers will get bonus payments of up to $800, but no answer as to why the government won’t be involved in the case seeking a permanent pay rise, as the royal commission, industry and unions have asked it to do. Sky’s Andrew Clennell asked about economic supports and added a gotcha question by asking for the price of bread, petrol and rapid antigen tests. Morrison replied: “I’m not going to pretend to you that I go out each day and I buy a loaf of bread and I buy a litre of milk.” Of course, Morrison was asked the price – not whether he bought it himself. On economic support, the answer wasn’t much better: “First of all, during the pandemic, you can’t pay for everything. Because it all has to be paid for.” Nine newspapers’ David Crowe asked why the federal government didn’t order more rapid antigen tests, given the risk of future variants and more cases. Morrison responded that the Therapeutic Goods Administration had approved many tests and was working with local producers, but was on less sure footing when trying to explain why more weren’t ordered. Morrison said “the medical advice to the government was not to use rapid antigen tests” because Australia had so few cases that we could use the more accurate PCR tests. Morrison said: The reason for that is that we were in Delta. And we were focused on getting the vaccinations in place because that is what would prevent the transmission … What happened with Omicron is that it flipped it completely. And it did it within a matter of weeks. And so, there had been no suggestion that rapid antigen tests from any official health advisers to the government was something as a priority over children’s vaccinations, over the booster shots. There was no answer beyond that on why there was no planning for more infectious variants. Of course, it’s an absurd idea that rapid tests and vaccinations were mutually exclusive. Two questions noted the government’s poor standing in the polls and queried why Morrison was best to lead the Coalition (Andrew Probyn from the ABC) and how he could catch up to the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese (Greg Brown from the Australian). On the first, Morrison replied that he trusted the Australian people, who would make “careful judgments” before they made “a decision that has consequences” by changing the government. But in a long answer making comparisons between himself and Labor on national security and other issues, Morrison didn’t touch the sides of the question about why he should be leading the Coalition – as opposed to, for the sake of an argument, Peter Dutton.",News/Australia news,‘We’re all terribly sorry’: five ways Scott Morrison dodged questions at the press club Q&A,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/01/were-all-terribly-sorry-five-ways-scott-morrison-dodged-questions-at-the-press-club-qa
2/1/2022,"Crows are being recruited to pick up discarded cigarette butts from the streets and squares of a Swedish city as part of a cost-cutting drive. The wild birds carry out the task as they receive a little food for every butt that they deposit in a bespoke machine designed by a startup in Södertälje, near Stockholm.  “They are wild birds taking part on a voluntary basis,” said Christian Günther-Hanssen, the founder of Corvid Cleaning, the company behind the method. The Keep Sweden Tidy Foundation says that more than 1bn cigarette butts are left on Sweden’s streets each year, representing 62% of all litter. Södertälje spends 20m Swedish kronor (£16m) on street cleaning. Günther-Hanssen estimates his method could save at least 75% of costs involved with picking up cigarette butts in the city. Södertälje is carrying out a pilot project before potentially rolling out the operation across the city. New Caledonian crows, a member of the corvid family of birds, are as good at reasoning as a human seven-year-old, research has suggested, making them the smartest birds for the job. Günther-Hanssen said: “They are easier to teach and there is also a higher chance of them learning from each other. At the same time, there’s a lower risk of them mistakenly eating any rubbish. “The estimation for the cost of picking up cigarette butts today is around 80 öre [Swedish change] or more per cigarette butt, some say two kronor. If the crows pick up cigarette butts, this would maybe be 20 öre per cigarette butt. The saving for the municipality depends on how many cigarette butts the crows pick up.” Tomas Thernström, a waste strategist at Södertälje municipality, said the potential of the pilot depended on financing. “It would be interesting to see if this could work in other environments as well. Also from the perspective that we can teach crows to pick up cigarette butts but we can’t teach people not to throw them on the ground. That’s an interesting thought,” he said.",News/Environment,Swedish firm deploys crows to pick up cigarette butts,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/01/swedish-crows-pick-up-cigarette-butts-litter
2/1/2022,"Last Friday, Jake Paul – the controversial YouTuber turned professional boxer – released a rap video targeting Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Aptly named the Dana White Diss Track, the song opens with a cameo from former UFC champion Cris Cyborg, who is pressured by an actor playing White into signing an exploitative contract that doesn’t even guarantee health care. Paul – who modestly portrays himself as a crusading hero – then launches into the track, which takes aim at White and his business partners Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta, as well as notable fighters such as Conor McGregor, Jorge Masvidal, Nate Diaz, and even retired champion Khabib Nurmagomedov.  The definitely not safe-for-work track, which has garnered more than 2m views on YouTube, is Paul’s latest attempt to call for improved pay in the UFC while escalating his personal conflict with White. “Dana, pay your fighters more. Give them healthcare, you scumbag. I haven’t met a single person who says anything good about you. I passed my drug test and you went silent. I’m keeping my foot on your neck until you tap, bitch,” proclaims Paul in the closing section of the video. “Stop raising your pay-per-view prices on the fans and not paying fighters more. Greedy, old, lonely, bald, bitch.” Paul and White have clashed repeatedly over the past few months. It began when Paul offered to retire from boxing and join the UFC roster if White agreed to raise fighter pay and provide long-term health care to his athletes. White responded by suggesting that Paul was using steroids. Unfazed by White’s attack, Paul announced last week that he had invested in Endeavor, the parent company of the UFC, with the intent of driving change from within. He then told ESPN’s Stephen A Smith that he planned to start a fighters’ union and that his conflict with White is “really about the fighters.” Paul’s verbal showdown with White has undoubtedly drawn attention to the mistreatment of fighters in the UFC. However, it also raises questions about Paul’s motivation given his (and his older brother Logan’s) history of monetizing controversy. The 25-year-old Paul launched his YouTube channel in 2014, which quickly became a platform for eye-popping antics that earned him more than 20 million subscribers. He grew to become one of YouTube’s most popular names until Logan Paul posted a December 2017 video of a dead body filmed in Japan’s infamous “suicide forest.” As a result of the backlash from the video, both brothers lost their sponsors and had their videos demonetized on YouTube. Though Jake Paul continues to be embroiled in various controversies – include throwing a party during the initial Covid -19 lockdown and allegations of sexual assault—he has since turned his attention to his flourishing boxing career, which accounts for the vast majority of his earnings. Earlier this month, Forbes estimated that Paul made a combined $40m for his three boxing wins in 2021, all of which took place against former UFC fighters. With his eyes set on several other potential UFC opponents, including Jorge Masvidal, it makes financial sense for Paul to bring attention to the organization’s oppressive contracts and its mistreatment of fighters, especially since White vehemently opposed the idea of Paul challenging those under contract with the UFC. Paul’s conflict with White also expands his popularity in the mixed martial arts community and presents him as a supposed defender of downtrodden athletes while bringing in more viewers to his fights. Given this, it comes as no surprise that Paul is creating videos attacking White while claiming that it is all for the benefit of underpaid fighters. Nevertheless, while Paul’s conflict with White is most likely self-serving, it would be foolish to ignore the fact that his fanbase and social media presence could provide an invaluable platform to spotlight the issue of fighter pay in the UFC. Unlike the vast majority of sports leagues and organizations, where athletes receive anywhere between 47-50% of the sport’s revenue, the UFC has historically paid out between 16-19%. In 2019, the promotion reported $900m in revenue, but only 16% was paid out to the UFC’s approximately 600 fighters. The UFC’s stranglehold led to a half-dozen former UFC fighters filing a $5bn antitrust lawsuit against UFC’s parent company, Zuffa LLC, in December 2014. The lawsuit charges the company with illegally acquiring and maintaining a monopoly over the MMA industry. It claims that the UFC used predatory practices and ran an illegal scheme to eliminate competition, which resulted in fighters being paid “a fraction of what they would earn in a competitive marketplace.” According to Lucas Middlebrook, a union-side labor attorney representing airline and professional sports labor groups, Paul has both the wealth and influence to play a crucial role in creating collective bargaining opportunities for fighters. “Jake Paul has the money to throw behind [unionizing fighters],” said Middlebrook. “He’s also got the ability to create media, which he can use as a tool to educate the fighters on the benefits that unionization could bring.” Middlebrook, who previously advised former UFC fighter Leslie Smith’s Project Spearhead labor association, added that if Paul wants to create real change, he should begin by funding grassroots organizing activities such as hiring former UFC athletes to educate current fighters and coordinate unionization efforts. These activities could be especially effective right now, as the National Labor Relations Board takes steps to investigate workplaces and employers that misclassify workers as independent contractors. UFC fighters are currently classified as independent contractors. “Once you’ve made the UFC bargain instead of implement, you take away their power and … see the empowerment of the labor. And once you see the empowerment of the labor, things start to change very quickly.” Paul has a unique opportunity to help countless fighters improve their livelihoods. Whether the YouTube star will follow through on his claims of support or simply stick to his brand of profiting from real-world controversy remains to be seen.",Sport/Sport,Jake Paul’s war on Dana White has escalated to diss tracks.
