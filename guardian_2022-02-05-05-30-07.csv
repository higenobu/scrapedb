2/5/2022,"The former Derby chairman Mel Morris has invited Middlesbrough and Wycombe Wanderers to take their claims to the High Court against him personally, in an attempt to remove a major obstacle in the financially stricken club’s attempt to secure a new owner. Morris has proposed to take on the liabilities facing Derby for gaining an advantage at their rivals’ expense to ease the looming threat of liquidation. The Championship club, aided by the sales of players in January, is thought to have enough cash to cover the remainder of this month.  Middlesbrough and Wycombe are seeking compensation worth millions after Derby breached financial rules. Boro missed out on the play-offs in 2018-19 and Wycombe were relegated to League One last season after finishing a point behind Derby. Morris said he has informed Quantuma, the club’s administrator, of his proposal so that they can discuss it with all parties, including English Football League and potential bidders. “I sincerely hope the EFL, Boro and Wycombe will respond urgently and constructively to my proposal to unlock the impasse,” Morris said in a lengthy statement released on Friday. On Thursday the league urged all parties involved to engage in urgent talks to resolve the impasse. Middlesbrough said the administrator had “consistently refused to engage” over their claim since Derby entered administration in September. They have been docked a total of 21 points this season. The manager, Wayne Rooney, has said rivals have “taken advantage” of their plight, with youngsters Luke Plange, Dylan Williams and Omari Kellyman departing for Crystal Palace, Chelsea and Aston Villa respectively during the transfer window. The EFL has made clear it disagrees with the administrators’ view that, under insolvency legislation, the club could avoid defending Middlesbrough and Wycombe’s claims and that they should not be treated as football-related debts. “MFC has always maintained that its claim against Derby County is a football-related debt and that it should be treated as such,” read a Middlesbrough statement in response to the league. “MFC welcomes the EFL’s confirmation that it shares this view. If the administrators believe that the EFL are not entitled to take this stance, MFC has offered to refer the matter to a judge to decide.” The EFL has, however, maintained that the compensation claims are one of a number of issues that require attention. Derby owe HM Revenue & Customs £29.3m and about £20m to MSD Holdings, an investment firm owned by Michael Dell, via loans secured against Pride Park, the stadium Morris owns. Arsenal are also owed installments for the £8m transfer of Krystian Bielik, Derby’s club-record signing. The club lease their Moor Farm training base from the Locko Estate. An EFL spokesperson said: “The EFL notes the comments published and the proposal tabled by Mr Morris this evening. It will now review in detail before considering its position and determining an appropriate response. In the meantime, as per Thursday’s statement, the offer to engage with Mr Morris and all other stakeholders remains in place as we seek to find the compromises required to protect Derby County in the long-term. The League will not be commenting any further on this specific matter at the current time.”",Sport/Football,Former Derby chairman invites clubs to make compensation claims against him,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/04/former-derby-chairman-invites-clubs-to-make-compensation-claims-against-him
2/5/2022,"Greetings card designers are being urged to stop using pugs and other flat-faced dogs and cats on Valentine’s Day cards as those sold by big retailers show how popular such images remain despite animal cruelty warnings from vets. The British Veterinary Association (BVA) has written to the Greeting Card Association and card retailers, including Moonpig, Paperchase, WH Smith, Scribbler, Clinton’s and Funky Pigeon, reigniting a call to action it first made four years ago to ban such images.  Its #HugsNotPugs campaign is aimed at curbing a worrying demand for flat-faced pets. The BVA believes using images of pugs on cards and gifts is normalising these breeds’ short noses and big eyes, which can cause pain for the animal and prove costly for the owner to treat. Despite raising the alarm in 2018 with its #BreedtoBreathe campaign, the BVA said there had still been no real change on the ground, and a look at Valentine’s Day cards in the shops this year throws up a similar array of animals bred for “cute” looks, it said. The BVA’s president, Justine Shotton, said: “Flat-faced dogs and cats like pugs, French bulldogs and Persians and ‘long and low’ breeds like dachshunds continue to remain popular on greetings cards and gifts this Valentine’s Day, even four years after vets started the #BreedToBreathe campaign. “These animals add a ‘cute’ appeal to merchandise but their looks mask a host of potential health and welfare problems. Valentine’s Day is a day for showing love, so giving a gift or card depicting an animal that can suffer because of how it has been bred is not the right message to give a loved one. That is why we are asking everyone to choose hugs not pugs to show your love this year. “Some card retailers and associations engaged with us when we wrote to them back in 2018, but, sadly, we have yet to see any real change. While stock for this year is already in the shops, we hope that card retailers will work with BVA to reduce the visibility and, hopefully, the popularity of these breeds in the future.” More than half of the brachycephalic dogs and a quarter of the brachycephalic cats that vets see need treatment for health issues related to how they look, according to the BVA’s Voice of the Veterinary Profession survey. In a letter sent to retailers, Shotton wrote: “Animals with extreme features who have been bred for looks over regard for their health have boomed in popularity over recent years, fuelled by the media, celebrities and the use of these animals in merchandising and advertising. “These are breeds that struggle with serious and often life-limiting health problems. For example, dogs and cats with short muzzles (pugs, French bulldogs and Persians, among others) can struggle to breathe and can also suffer from a range of other problems including eye ulcers, skin infections and spinal abnormalities. “We appreciate that the images on your cards are meant to be fun, however, we fear that further visibility of flat-faced dogs and cats or ‘long and low’ pets will only create higher demand for the animals.”",News/UK news,Vets call for end to use of flat-faced dogs on greeting cards,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/04/vets-call-for-end-to-use-of-flat-faced-dogs-on-greeting-cards
2/5/2022,"Boris Johnson’s attempts to rally his dilapidated top team floundered on Friday after a second cabinet minister distanced himself from the prime minister and another Conservative MP called for him to go. In a bid to shore up support, Johnson wrote to MPs promising them a “direct line to Downing Street”, but his move came as Sajid Javid followed the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in rejecting Johnson’s remarks linking Starmer with the failure to prosecute paedophile Jimmy Savile.  The health secretary said Starmer had done “a good job” as director of public prosecutions and that “he should be respected for it”. Javid said he was glad Johnson had “clarified” his remarks – though the prime minister has not apologised. Sunak said of Johnson’s comments on Thursday: “I wouldn’t have said it.” The attempt to smear Starmer led to the departure of Johnson’s longstanding policy chief, Munira Mirza, on Thursday. In another sign of Johnson’s waning authority, Newcastle-under-Lyme MP Aaron Bell became the ninth Tory backbencher to confirm publicly that he had submitted a letter of no confidence in the prime minister. “The breach of trust that the events in Downing Street represent, and the manner in which they have been handled, makes [Johnson’s] position untenable,” Bell said in a statement on Friday. The MP was widely believed to have submitted a letter after he challenged the prime minister in the House of Commons on Monday. Bell told MPs he had followed the lockdown rules meticulously, driving three hours each way to his grandmother’s funeral without hugging his family or stopping for a cup of tea, and asked pointedly: “Does the prime minister think I’m a fool?” If 54 letters are sent to the chair of the backbench 1922 Committee, Sir Graham Brady, a vote of no confidence will be called – and if Johnson loses it, his premiership will be over. Some senior Tory MPs believe the total number of letters may be close to 40, though the total is never made public until the threshold is reached. More are likely to when details emerge of whether Downing Street staff have been fined for breaching lockdown rules. The Met is investigating a dozen parties in Downing Street and Whitehall and has been handed a bundle of evidence including 300 photographs. One person who has seen some of them said, “It looked like a party to me”, adding that they would not be surprised if up to 20 No 10 staff ended up being given fixed penalty notices. Johnson sought to placate Conservative MPs on Friday with a conciliatory letter detailing plans to include them in future policymaking. He is also planning a policy blitz next week, according to government sources, with announcements expected “pretty much every day”, including on health and a potential overseas trip for discussions on the crisis in Ukraine. Johnson flew to Ukraine earlier this week, and No 10 subsequently released a publicity video about the trip with a movie-style soundtrack. This week also saw the publication of the long-awaited levelling-up white paper and Sunak’s cost of living measures, but Downing Street has struggled to wrench the headlines away from the ongoing chaos in No 10. Johnson told MPs in his letter: “I understand the deep importance of engaging with colleagues in parliament and listening to your views, and that is why I want colleagues to have a direct line into 10 Downing Street,” he wrote. “I promised change and this is what we will now deliver together.” One former cabinet minister said they believed the departures from the PM’s team on Thursday evening – which left him without a director of communications, a principal private secretary or a chief of staff – could hasten Johnson’s own exit. “The mass exodus is obviously bad for Boris and may bring forward decision day,” they said. Another former minister said: “I think there are probably a lot of people who are going to be wrestling with their consciences over the weekend.” They said the exodus from Downing Street “all looks a little bit like panic”. Elena Narozanski, a special adviser to the prime minister on women and equalities, culture, media and sport and extremism, became the fifth aide to depart on Friday morning. Johnson’s spokesman said new appointments would be made “in the coming days”. Some MPs say they are awaiting for these before judging whether Johnson has fulfilled the promise he made to overhaul his top team. One Tory insider said the situation was “very fluid” but that No 10 would want to make the appointments before the weekend was out. Among those being tipped for a communications job are Simon McGee, a former Foreign Office press head, and the current press secretary, Rosie Bate-Williams. For more strategic roles, insiders suggested David Canzini, an ally of Lynton Crosby, and Ross Kempsell, a senior political operator at Conservative campaign headquarters. Lord Frost has already made clear that he will not come back into the fold while the National Insurance rise is going ahead, and former aides Lord Lister and Will Walden are also thought to be resistant to returning. Another senior figure in communications said he had turned down the job previously and would not go to a “sinking ship”. The prime minister gathered No 10 staff in the cabinet room for a pep talk on Friday morning, quoting the Lion King to tell them “change is good”, after five members of his senior team, including Mirza, had quit in the space of less than 24 hours. Johnson’s spokesman said: “He reflected on the privilege of working in No 10 in order to deliver for the British people and reiterated his and No 10’s commitment to serving the public by keeping people safe, improving lives and spreading opportunity.”",News/Politics,Johnson struggles to rally team as pressure on him builds up,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/04/boris-johnson-struggles-to-rally-team-as-pressure-on-him-builds-up
2/5/2022,"MJ, a megawatt new jukebox musical on Michael Jackson which opened on Broadway this week, is from the outset a dubious proposition. There is, first of all, the challenge of finding new things to say about an artist who is both ubiquitous – his music and dancing elemental to modern pop – and famously inscrutable. And then there’s the permanent stain on any mention of Jackson’s legacy: the allegations of child sexual abuse, detailed at length in the disturbing, meticulous 2019 HBO documentary Leaving Neverland. (The Jackson estate, which collaborated on the development of MJ the Musical, vehemently denies all allegations; Jackson was acquitted of child molestation in 2005.) If your head is not in the sand, there’s no way to enter the Neil Simon Theatre without a load of uncomfortable baggage.  MJ the Musical, directed and choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon from a book by the Pulitzer-winning dramatist Lynn Nottage, mostly ignores that baggage via an electric and absorbing spin through Jackson’s career. It’s a rollicking parade of hits, vocal high points, and a sanitized spin through Jackson’s life that sketches demons without filling them in. It’s also a discomfiting experience, in both what’s obviously left off-stage (this is a commercial Broadway musical which ejected a Variety reporter for asking cast about the allegations at the premiere) and its portrayal of Michael Jackson as a lonely Peter Pan in turmoil. The tone is triumphant; the story is a tragedy. MJ opens in 1992, in the final rehearsals for the Dangerous tour, a decision which bypasses many of Jackson’s infamous tabloid stories – the hyperbaric chamber, Bubbles the chimp, his disappearing nose; also the molestation trial and his death from a cocktail of prescription medications in 2009. MJ (an outstanding Myles Frost), as his team calls him, is on edge, making extensive last-minute edits played for uneasy laughs. Unbeknown to him, his tour manager, Rob (Quentin Earl Darrington, who doubles as Joe Jackson), has permitted an MTV journalist, Rachel (Whitney Bashor), and a cameraman, Alejandro (Gabriel Ruiz), to film rehearsals. The tension is obvious – the dancers are overworked (yet still sinuous, enjoyable to watch), the tour is hemorrhaging funds and MJ is reliant on painkillers. As Rachel presses, MJ begins to reflect on his life, prompting several seamless, Technicolor flashback sequences that lift the pall of what we now know about Jackson. There’s Little Michael (an excellent Christian Wilson, and in other performances Walter Russell III) in the Jackson 5, coaxed into the spotlight by his older brothers, abusive and demeaning father Joe, and pliant mother Katherine (Ayana George, whose stunning voice prompted cheers from the audience multiple times). There’s Motown and Soul Train and teenage Michael (a remarkable Tavon Olds-Sample) busting at the seams with creative energy and insecurities; there’s Quincy Jones (Apollo Levine) and Thriller and the eight Grammys and Bad. This roll through the hits, like Jackson the pop star, casts an alluring spell. At the performance I attended, audience shouts of “Sing it!” and “Whew!” peppered the performance, the magic of Jackson’s art, even when embodied by others, still that potent. The spectacle is effective; a reimagining of Thriller as a haunted carnival of MJ’s psychological demons – the toll of perfectionism and the ghosts of bad ideologies with a phantasmagoric Joe Jackson presiding – brought the house down. Sound design by Gareth Owen layered a bass so thick I thought it gave me a heart arrhythmia (in a good way). Orchestration and arrangement by Jason Michael Webb and David Holcenberg, lighting by Natasha Katz, and costumes Paul Tazewell are Technicolor, whimsical and exact. If you can forget, it’s a fun ride. As for that forgetting: it’s not total. There’s no mention of “abuse” but there is a demand from a reporter in a scrum – “What do you have to say about the recent allegations?” – wedged in with questions about his tour, fame and plastic surgery. But it’s a small out – the elephant in the room cast in the dimmest light, nodded at once or twice. Though the musical – and the audience, in the show I attended, as I imagine all the others – are firmly on the side of Jackson as the hero and creative visionary, there are glimpses of different visions: Jackson the mercurial star on the wane, the addict, the unreasonable boss, the eerily childish adult, the exacting perfectionist, the pop star who spent lavishly and traveled with an unusual entourage. “Who is this family he wants to bring on tour?” a member of his beleaguered staff asks, the other moment when the script gestures to the shadow looming overhead. Frost accomplishes the impressive feat of embodying the King of Pop – moonwalk, willowy yet commanding presence, delicate voice – as both haunted human and alien, unsure what it means to love and live. His MJ is a fragile stress ball, an electric performer and a strange creature. “I want to keep this about my music,” he tells Rachel in one interview, when she presses on his feelings. MJ the Musical is bound by design and collaboration with the estate to that request, honored to at times mesmerizing, ultimately discomforting effect. Certainly many viewers will abide by the same compartmentalization and have a guiltless good time, and others, myself included, will find that impossible.",Arts/Stage,MJ the Musical review – mesmerizing parade of hits doesn’t look in the mirror,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/feb/04/mj-the-musical-review-broadway
