3/24/2022,"Britain’s latest round of sanctions against Russia has gone above and beyond simple financial punishment, airing a bit of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov’s dirty laundry in the process. In its list of the 65 new individuals and organizations targeted for “aiding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” the British Foreign Office appears to have made a point to call out Lavrov’s “secret family” in London, with its inclusion of Polina Kovalev, whom it describes as his stepdaughter. Kovalev’s inclusion on the list appears to confirm exhaustive reporting by Kremlin foe Alexei Navalny’s team that Lavrov, 71, has been living a “double life” for nearly two decades. One that includes a “secret wife,” identified by Navalny’s allies as Svetlana Polyakova, an actress and a restaurateur with sway in Russia’s Foreign Ministry. “A source in the foreign ministry told journalists that the whole ministry knows that this woman is Lavrov’s wife. And almost the most influential person in the foreign ministry. She can fire whoever she doesn’t like,” the report by Navalny’s team noted. Polina Kovaleva is reportedly Polyakova’s daughter from an earlier marriage. She is said to reside in a lavish Kensington apartment she purchased for a whopping £ 4.4 million ($5.8 million) at the age of 21. The U.K.’s list of new sanctions also target Oleg Tinkov, the founder of Tinkoff Bank; Herman Gref, the CEO of Sberbank, the largest Russian bank; and Galina Danilchenko, who was installed by Russian forces as the mayor of the Ukrainian city of Melitopol. Danilchenko has also been sanctioned “for collaboration with Russian forces currently in Ukraine,” Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said. “These oligarchs, businesses, and hired thugs are complicit in the murder of innocent civilians and it is right that they pay the price,” Truss said in a statement accompanying a list of the targeted individuals.

3/24/2022,"A serial rapist who sometimes pretended to be an Uber driver to lure in his victims has been sentenced for his crimes. Christian Burks, 26, was accused of kidnapping and raping five women between October 2017 and December 2019 in Cleveland, Ohio, as previously announced by the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s Office. On Tuesday, he was sentenced to 41-44 and a half years in prison for a multitude of charges to which he had pleaded guilty to on March 9. Burks pleaded guilty to five counts of rape, four counts of kidnapping, two counts of abduction, one count of domestic violence, and one count of theft. As part of the plea deal, charges of gross sexual imposition and misuse of a credit card were taken off the table. At the hearing, Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court Judge Joan Synenberg referred to Burks as a “cunning” and “ruthless” man who sometimes pretended to be a ride-share driver for unsuspecting women waiting to be driven home, according to Cleveland.com. “There is not one thing that the victims did where they bear responsibility for what happened to them,” said Synenberg. “I hope they can free themselves of any space you occupy in their heads.” The prosecutor’s office had previously provided an initial timeline of Burks’ crimes, beginning with the Dec. 9, 2018 rape of a 20-year-old victim who attended a party with her friends at an East 4th Street residence. After lying down in a separate room in the apartment, Burks made his way into the room and proceeded to sexually assault her, despite several attempts by her to stop him. Then, on May 24, 2020, a man and woman, both 23, entered Burks’ vehicle outside a bar on West 6th Street — a popular, short strip of bars in downtown Cleveland — believing he was their Uber driver. Burks made a stop at a gas station and, when the man went in to buy water, Burks sped away with the female passenger. Burks later dropped the woman off at her residence and stole her credit cards, “which he used to make several purchases,” according to the prosecutor’s office. Days later, Burks engaged in an altercation with a 24-year-old woman he forced into his vehicle. When she yelled for help and tried to escape while on the interstate, Burks grabbed her by the neck, dragged her back into the vehicle, and sped away. That woman left the courtroom in tears as other witnesses spoke at Tuesday's sentencing, according to Cleveland.com. “I never would have thought my life would have gotten here,” said the woman. “I was tricked into believing someone was what they weren’t.” On Nov. 15, 2020, Burks sexually assaulted a 21-year-old woman multiple times in his vehicle after she became separated from a group of friends at a bar near West 6th Street. Less than a month later, Burks sexually assaulted another woman who was waiting for an Uber outside a West 6th Street bar. After raping the woman in his vehicle, he took her to an East Cleveland hotel and fled before police arrived. “Christian Burks is a serial sexual predator,” said Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Michael O’Malley following Burks’ 2021 indictment. “He will be held accountable for his actions.” Not listed in the prosecutor’s original press release was another attack dating back to Oct. 22, 2017 for which he was also sentenced announcement. In that case, Burks raped a 21-year-old victim after pretending to be her Uber driver as she waited outside a bar. In court, Burks told the judge that he was intoxicated and barely remembered attacking the women, as reported by Cleveland.com. Some of the women addressed him in court during sentencing. “I hope you’re haunted by my limp body lying in the backseat of your car. I hope you never live another day without the soul-crushing weight of me on your mind,” said one of the victims. “I am not weak. I am not defenseless. I am not an object for you to use at your disposal. I will not be haunted by the thought of you.” Another one of the victims who mistook Burks for an Uber driver also addressed him. “But I can stand up here and tell you today that the world is a less safe and more dangerous place for all of these young women when this man is allowed freedom,"" she said. As part of his sentencing, Burks must also register as a tier three sex offender every 90 days for the rest of his life.",U.S./Oxygen,'I Hope You're Haunted By My Limp Body:' Cleveland Serial Rapist Who Pretended To Be Uber Driver Sentenced,https://news.yahoo.com/hope-youre-haunted-limp-body-194801444.html
3/24/2022,"STORY: One month since the Russian invasion began, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called for solidarity as Western powers gather in Brussels to discuss the conflict. In a video address on Thursday, Zelenskiy repeated his calls for a no-fly zone and said Western countries had not provided Ukraine with needed planes, tanks and other weapons. ""At these three summits we will see who is a friend, who is a partner, and who has sold out and betrayed [us]. Life can be protected only in unity. Freedom must be armed."" Hours before on Wednesday, U.S. President Joe Biden arrived in Brussels to attend the emergency NATO, G7 and EU summits. There the U.S. is set to announce further sanctions on Russian political figures and oligarchs, while NATO is expected to boost its forces in Eastern Europe. But Biden’s European allies, some of which are heavily reliant on Russian oil and gas, may be divided on imposing further energy sanctions. Also on Wednesday, a UN resolution drafted by Russia that called for further aid to Ukraine, but without mentioning Moscow’s role in the conflict failed at the U.N. Security Council. Britain’s ambassador to the UN Barbara Woodward slammed the draft resolution after the vote, citing Russia’s quote “war crimes... bombing maternity hospitals, schools and homes.” “If Russia cared about the humanitarian situation, it would stop bombing children and end their siege tactics. But they haven't.” Russia denies targeting civilians, and calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation” that is not designed to capture territory, but at demilitarizing its neighbor and capturing what it regards as dangerous nationalists. The West says this is a baseless pretext for an unprovoked war.",Politics/Reuters Videos,"Ukraine urges solidarity, Biden arrives in Brussels",https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-urges-solidarity-biden-arrives-070935178.html
