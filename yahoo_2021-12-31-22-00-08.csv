12/31/2021,"Visa and Mastercard will lose out to Web3-based payment projects in 2022, Chamath Palihapitiya said. Both companies are a ""completely contrived duopoly that doesn't need to exist,"" he said. He cited Amazon's decision to ban Visa credit cards in the UK due to high transaction fees as one reason for his view. Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell. Billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitya has boldly predicted that Visa and Mastercard, two of the biggest payment processors, will be overthrown by emerging blockchain and DeFi projects in 2022. ""My biggest business loser for 2022 is Visa and MasterCard and traditional payment rails and the entire ecosystem around it,"" he said in an episode of the ""All-In Podcast"" released Wednesday. To him, the long-standing payment systems used all over the world are a ""completely contrived duopoly that doesn't need to exist."" Palihapitya, a former Facebook executive who runs the venture capital fund Social Capital, shared what he thinks will be the ""most profitable spread trade"" of his lifetime in the coming year. ""Be short these companies and anybody that basically lives off of this 2 or 3% (transaction) tax, and be long well-thought-out, Web3 crypto projects that are rebuilding payments infrastructure in a completely decentralized way,"" he said. Without being specific, he predicted at the same time that ""a lot of these scammy crypto projects will go to zero."" ""If you read the whitepapers of these crypto projects, and you systematically put together a framework, I think you can be long those and you can be short Visa/MasterCard, because I think this is their peak market cap,"" he added. A spread trade is a market order in which a trader simultaneously carries out a purchase of one security and sale of a related security in a single unit. Investors execute this trade to attempt to profit from the spread, or difference, between the buying and selling prices. Palihapitya based his opinion on Amazon's decision to ban the usage of Visa credit cards in the UK, because of high transaction fees, last month. ""The canary in the coal mine here is pretty significant,"" he said. ""Amazon is not going to do something like that, in my opinion, unless it's a test of what they can do all around the world."" ""There really is no need today for all these small businesses to sit on top of Visa, MasterCard, and AmEx rails. It's unnecessary."" He also predicted the first movers for the adoption of this emergent technology will be in the developing world. ""This is why I think focusing in markets like Nigeria to me are way more exciting than talking about these fading Western European countries. This is where this stuff will happen,"" he said. ""We'll look back in 10 years and (traditional payment processors) market caps will be materially lower."" Visa and Mastercard have been underperformers in 2021, with their stock prices roughly flat year-to-date, compared with a roughly 27% gain in the S&P 500.

A Delta Air Lines passenger assaulted a police officer after he was stopped from boarding a flight to from LA to New York, according to police. The passenger, who has not been named, was stopped from boarding at LAX, TMZ first reported. He wasn't allowed to board because Delta staff felt he was ""too intoxicated to fly,"" airport official Rob Pedregon told Fox News. A Delta spokesperson told Fox that police were called to escort the passenger out of the terminal after he became verbally abusive at the departure gate. Delta did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. After officers arrived, Pedregon told the media outlet, the passenger had a ""moment of rage"" and assaulted an officer by punching him in the chest. Footage of the incident published by TMZ shows an officer tackling him to the ground. While pinned, he can be heard saying: ""You ruined my whole fucking day, bro, now I have to travel a whole other day... it fucking sucks, dude.""

12/31/2021,"The European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope—yes, that’s actually the name—has discovered a brand-new world. The planet in question is located 325 light-years away from Earth, in the Centaurus constellation. The planet itself orbits b Centauri, a two-star system that you can often see with the naked eye. Scientists say that this star system is the hottest planet-hosting system that we know of. It is now known as b Centauri (AB)b, or b Centauri b. Additionally, scientists found that the new world orbits its star over 100 times the distance between Jupiter and the Sun.

Because of how hot the two-star system is, it doesn’t make sense for planets to have formed within it. As such, scientists are perplexed at how this new world formed. Scientists say the heat from the two stars in the b Centauri system should work against the formation of new worlds or planets. Likewise, the sheer mass of the system should have a negative effect as well. The b Centauri system is home to two stars that are collectively six to 10 times heavier than our Sun. As such, that makes it the most massive system scientists have confirmed the presence of a planet in thus far. The planet itself is nothing to scoff at, either. According to the study, b Centauri b is 10 times bigger than Jupiter. That makes it one of the largest new worlds that humanity has discovered throughout the decades that we’ve studied space. Its orbit is also larger than anything we’ve previously seen. Researchers say it orbits in a wide orbit 100 times greater than that of Jupiter around the sun. While the discovery is relatively new, the researchers found that the ESO’s 3.6-m telescope captured an image of the planet almost 20 years ago. However, scientists didn’t recognize it as a planet at the time. One of the most perplexing things about this new world is the fact that the large mass and heat from the two stars should be creating enough high-energy radiation that anything around it starts to evaporate faster. However, this planetary discovery goes against everything we currently know about planet formations. The planet in b Centauri is an alien world in an environment that is completely different from what we experience here on Earth and in our Solar System,” co-author Gayathri Viswanath, a Ph.D. student at Stockholm University, explained in a press release by the ESO. “It’s a harsh environment, dominated by extreme radiation, where everything is on a gigantic scale: the stars are bigger, the planet is bigger, the distances are bigger.” Researchers will need to dig into things a bit more to discover exactly how this new world formed.

12/31/2021,"By Keith Coffman DENVER (Reuters) -A fierce, wind-driven wildfire destroyed hundreds of homes, injured at least a half dozen people and prompted the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents in and around two towns east of the Rockies near Denver, authorities said on Thursday. The swiftly spreading prairie grass fire was believed to have been ignited by sparks from power lines and transformers toppled by high winds on Colorado's drought-parched Front Range, according to Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle. Evacuation orders were first issued for all residents in the town of Superior, Colorado, with a population of about 13,000, and a short time later for the adjacent municipality of Louisville, home to more than 18,000 residents, the Boulder County emergency management office said on Twitter. Separately, the National Weather Service office in Boulder tweeted: ""All Superior under an Evacuation ORDER. LEAVE NOW!"" Within hours, the blaze had swept an estimated 1,600 acres (647.5 hectares) and destroyed more than 500 homes, Pelle told reporters at a news briefing. He said an entire subdivision of 370 homes went up in flames west of Superior, and that 210 dwellings were lost in the Old Town area of Superior, along with additional residences in the area. Property losses also included a shopping center and hotel in Superior, officials said. Governor Jared Polis said flames were consuming football fields of landscape in a matter of seconds, calling the conflagration ""a force of nature."" The sheriff said gale-force winds made it impossible to halt the fire's rapid advance, adding that fire and emergency personnel were ""essentially running ahead of this just trying to get people out of the way. That's all you can do."" Pelle said tens of thousands of area residents were under evacuation orders. Among them were about 30 patients, along with staff, from Avista Adventist Hospital in Louisville, which was shut down and fully evacuated as of late afternoon, according to the medical network Centura Health. Some patients were discharged. The rest were transferred to other Centura hospitals. The sheriff said he had no reports of people missing and no deaths reported. Six people were treated for injuries from the wildfires at the UCHealth hospital in the neighboring city of Broomfield, spokesperson Kelli Christensen said. But she declined to specify the nature of the injuries or the patients' conditions. The extent of property losses was not immediately known, but KMGH-TV, the local ABC News affiliate, aired footage of multiple homes engulfed in flames. A towering plume of smoke from the wildfire was visible in Denver, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) to the south. Wind gusts of up to 110 miles (177 km) per hour were reported in Boulder, according to the National Weather Service, which said fast-moving fires were creating a ""life-threatening situation"" in the Superior and Louisville areas. Authorities said forecasts called for diminishing winds late on Thursday or early on Friday, which would enable firefighters to get ahead of the flames and for water-dropping helicopters and airplane tankers to be deployed against the blaze. Polis declared a state of emergency allowing use of disaster funding to support emergency response efforts in Boulder County and to allow mobilization of the Colorado National Guard and other state resources as needed. The fire on the outskirts of the Denver metropolitan area, left bone dry from an extreme drought gripping eastern Colorado, follows several days of heavy snow in the Rocky Mountains to the west. However, forecasts call for snow to hit Denver and eastern Colorado starting on Friday.
