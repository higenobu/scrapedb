2/3/2022,"Good morning. Yesterday Joe Biden announced that the US will deploy more than 3,000 US troops in Germany, Poland and Romania as Russia continues to build up its forces around Ukraine. Russia’s deputy foreign minister has since responded, calling the move a “destructive step”.  Alexander Grushko said the increased troops would “increase military tension and reduce scope for political decision”, and would “delight” Ukrainian authorities. Russia had been moving 30,000 combat troops and modern weapons to Belarus over the last few days, Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said today. It is Moscow’s biggest military deployment to the country since the end of the cold war. This comes as the west continues to deploy a flurry of diplomatic efforts – yesterday Boris Johnson, the United Kingdom prime minister, warned Vladimir Putin in a phone call that he will make a “tragic miscalculation” if he invades Ukraine. France’s Emmanuel Macron was set to speak to Putin on Wednesday night as well, their third conversation in less than a week, while the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said he would meet Putin in Moscow soon. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan will fly to Moscow to offer himself as a mediator between Ukraine and Putin. A wild card of Nato diplomacy, Turkey was criticized by both Russia and Ukraine last year – Putin was unhappy when Turkey sold drones to the Ukrainian army, while Ukrainian politicians have been angered by a gas pipeline that takes gas from Russia to Turkey. To reignite the “moonshot” initiative against the deadly disease that was first announced in 2016 when he was vice-president, Joe Biden has announced a 25-year timeline for reducing the cancer death rate by 50%. “We can end cancer as we know it,” Biden said. “I committed to this fight when I was vice-president. It’s one of the reasons why, quite frankly, I ran for president. Let there be no doubt, now that I am president, this is a presidential White House priority.” Biden’s son, Beau, died of brain cancer in 2015. Actor Michael K Williams died of acute drug intoxication in September and was found by family members in his penthouse apartment. At the time, the death of the Wire and Boardwalk Empire star was ruled an accident. A federal prosecutor announced yesterday that Williams overdosed on fentanyl-laced heroin, and four men have been charged in connection with his death. “This is a public health crisis,” the prosecutor said. “And it has to stop.” In a new book, Donald Trump’s ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, recounted how the former president “knocked everyone off their chairs” in a meeting with then-president of Israel Reuven Rivlin in May 2017, when he criticized the then-prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, for being unwilling to seek peace while Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian leader, was “desperate” for a deal. “Although the meeting was private and off the record, we all envisioned a headline tomorrow that Trump had praised Abbas and criticized Netanyahu – the worst possible dynamic for the president’s popularity or for the prospects of the peace process,” Friedman wrote. “Fortunately, and incredibly, the event wasn’t leaked.” US special forces have killed 13 people in a hunt for high-ranking jihadists in north-western Syria, an operation the Pentagon described as “successful”. The International Space Station will plummet to a watery grave in 2031 after more than 30 years in service, when Nasa plans to “de-orbit” it out of commission. A Northern California county is on track to be run by a militia-aligned group after voters in the conservative outpost ousted a retired police chief from his role on the county board of supervisors. Tainted cocaine has killed at least 20 in Argentina and sent dozens more to the hospital. Authorities are investigating whether the drug had been intentionally cut with a toxic substance. Researchers conducted a landmark trial in which healthy volunteers were intentionally given a dose of Covid-19 and found that exposure to a just one nasal droplet is sufficient to become infected. The trial, conducted by scientists at Imperial College London, was the first to have monitored people during the entire course of infection. More than two years into a deadly pandemic that has irrevocably changed the course of history, individuals suffering from long Covid – the long-term, lingering effects of coronavirus, long after any initial flu-like symptoms have abated – are still fighting for recognition and find themselves often still trying to convince skeptics that their symptoms are real. Wildfires today are grabbing headlines across the world with their destructiveness, erratic behavior and size. However, fewer fires are actually burning today than ever before – but that’s not a good thing. In shunning indigenous traditions of burning excess vegetation as a method of land management, fires have become stranger and less predictable.

2/3/2022,"Northern Ireland’s Stormont executive is once again on the brink of an existential crisis with an announcement widely expected that the first minister, Paul Givan, intends to resign. What does it mean and will Stormont collapse?  Senior members of the Democratic Unionist party are to meet on Thursday with an announcement expected imminently that Givan intends to resign. The move is the culmination of months of protests by the Democratic Unionist party against the post-Brexit checks on goods crossing the Irish sea. The DUP has been threatening to quit Stormont since 9 September last year but at each self-imposed deadline has stepped back from the brink. Givan’s resignation is being seen as two-step move to finally deliver on the threat. On Wednesday night, the DUP agriculture minister, Edwin Poots, made the first move, ordering a halt from midnight to post-Brexit checks on food and farm products that were brought as part of the Northern Ireland protocol between the UK and EU. It emerged early on Thursday that the checks were continuing. Poots claimed they would be gone in a few days once the senior civil servant in charge had cleared up some unidentified financial issues. Checks on food and farm products as well as customs paperwork are mandated by the Northern Ireland protocol, a subsection of the wider Brexit withdrawal agreement brokered personally by Boris Johnson to get the Brexit deal over the line in January 2020. The DUP campaigned for Brexit in the 2016 referendum but has objected from the outset to the arrangements made in the protocol designed to avoid a border on the island of Ireland. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who has taken over Brexit negotiations in Brussels from Lord Frost, is in the middle of negotiations with Brussels, with both sides declaring they want a deal before March. The UK is pursuing an interim deal with an elimination of most of the checks on food and farm products followed by a wider solution on government after the May elections. The Irish European commissioner Mairead McGuinness has said Poots’s order is a breach of international law. And it seems that the legal risk was also an issue for the DUP leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson. Only last week the DUP gave Brussels and London until 21 February to come up with a new deal eliminating the checks on goods crossing the Irish sea. The DUP is under mounting political pressure at home. Polls show it will lose its position to Sinn Féin as Northern Ireland’s largest party in the May elections with a rival party, the Ulster Unionist party, snapping at its heels. Its electoral gamble is that walking out of Stormont will pay off at the polls. The deputy first minister, Michelle O’Neill of Sinn Féin, must also go as the special post-conflict power-sharing arrangements do not allow one party to rule. But other ministers can remain in post. No, but it means its decision-making powers would be severely weakened. The executive or cabinet could not officially meet as its chair and deputy chair would be absent. It would also mean that new policy decisions could not be taken, a new three-year budget would not be approved and other items such as the appointment of a victims’ commissioner would be put on hold. The Traditional Unionist Voice says it is “about time” the DUP carried out its threat. Sinn Féin and the Social Democratic and Labour party have called the move an election stunt. The Alliance party has said it is an “act of harm” and the Ulster Unionist party has urged the DUP not to sabotage Stormont. The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, says the decision to halt post-Brexit checks is a matter for the Stormont executive.",News/Politics,Why Paul Givan may resign – and what it would mean for Stormont,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/03/why-paul-givan-may-resign-and-what-it-would-mean-for-stormont
2/3/2022,"The Covid-19 vaccine developed by Novavax has been approved by the UK regulator for use in people over the age of 18. The vaccine will not be immediately widely available as its use as part of the UK’s vaccination programme will be considered by the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation.  Clinical trials suggest two doses of the Novavax jab have an efficacy of about 90% against symptomatic Covid, similar to the other approved UK vaccines. A recent study by Novavax suggests its protection holds up much better against Omicron than most other vaccines, raising the prospect that it may be able to provide broader protection across variants in future. June Raine, the chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), said: “Our approval of Nuvaxovid today follows a rigorous review of the safety, quality and effectiveness of this vaccine, and expert advice from the government’s independent scientific advisory body, the Commission on Human Medicines.” The decision is expected to address travel issues for Britons who took part in trials of the Novavax vaccine, initially leaving them ineligible to travel to certain countries because the vaccine had not been approved by the UK regulator. The government announced in October the thousands of UK trial participants would be offered the Pfizer/BioNTech jab; the latest decision should resolve the situation for those who did not take up the offer. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said: “It is great to see our world-renowned medicines regulator approve another Covid-19 vaccine. I want the UK to be the best place in the world to conduct clinical trials. It’s a testament to the country’s first-rate research and development capabilities for vaccines – with tens of thousands of people taking part in clinical trials here in the UK, contributing to the invaluable research that shows our vaccines are safe and effective.” Novavax’s offering is a protein-based vaccine that uses more established technology than some others, similar to the flu jab and routine childhood vaccines against whooping cough or meningococcal infection. There is early evidence that it could have reduced side-effects, with trial data appearing to show lower rates of fatigue, headaches and muscle pain. Public health experts hope that these factors could convince as yet unvaccinated people who are sceptical of new technology or worried about side-effects from other vaccines to get a shot. Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed, the chair of the independent Commission on Human Medicines, said: “Nuvaxovid is distinct from other Covid-19 vaccines currently in use in the UK as it uses recombinant protein-based technology which has been used for many years in the development of vaccines to prevent other illnesses, for example hepatitis B.”",News/Society,Novavax Covid vaccine approved for use in over-18s in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/03/novavax-covid-vaccine-approved-for-use-in-over-18s-in-uk
2/3/2022,"It shouldn’t work, and maybe it shouldn’t even have got made. But it does and it has: and Joanna Hogg has given us an amazingly luminous self-portrait of the film-maker as a young woman: metatextual, confessional and autobiographical. And in two parts, what’s more, demanding our attention and getting it (the first part came out in 2019). The Souvenir is a movie that has defied the laws of film industry gravity, and those big names in the credits don’t in themselves explain this: a film that has floated free of what might be expected commercially or in any other way and carries itself with a marvellous austere artistry and compositional flair. And the sunbursts of emotion in the musical soundtrack gave me enough vitamin D to last the rest of the year. In this second part, I found the things that were a challenge the first time around, such as its tendency to the opaque (although not unexpected for this director), have melted away, and the return of these characters is like the return of old friends and old lovers.  Honor Swinton Byrne is back as Julie, the insouciantly well-off young film student who we saw in the previous film having a tragic amour fou with a mysterious, complicated man called Anthony (Tom Burke) of destructive and predatory habits. Now Julie must creatively exorcise his devastating presence in her life and to that end, worries her film-school examiners by proposing to abandon the worthy docu-style study of working lives in Sunderland that she was supposed to be working on, going instead for a wild new personal fantasia, a non-narrative Bildungskino of the mind and heart. It sounds a bit Fellini-esque, and Hogg’s own film about it has a little of Almodóvar. But when we finally see the finished graduation film, there are moments of Powell and Pressburger, directors whom Anthony had affected to admire. Tilda Swinton is back as Julie’s amiably grand and patrician mother Rosalind (allowing us once again to savour the fact that she is Swinton Byrne’s mother in real life); she allows Julie to live rent-free in the smart little pied-à-terre the family has in Knightsbridge and keeps on getting pestered for large amounts of money so Julie can make her graduation film. Hilariously, Rosalind has been inspired by her daughter to take a creative class of her own, in pottery, and is terribly proud of a wonky little “Etruscan” pot she has made – and the awful fate of this artefact made me jump out of my seat and hide my eyes at the same time. And non-professional James Spencer Ashworth is back, wonderfully playing Julie’s lovable, sweet-natured dad William. As Julie’s life and studies progress, Swinton Byrne shows us how Julie is growing up, going into therapy to deal with her anxiety and loneliness, accepting a sexual proposition from one of the actors, and also getting tougher, arguing for the camera positions she wants from the recalcitrant DP and having to let down actor mates who had assumed she was going to cast them in her film. Ariane Labed and Harris Dickinson play the people she actually chooses to do the Julie and Anthony roles, although dizzyingly – and perhaps inevitably – it is Swinton Byrne and Burke whose faces we see on screen. And Hogg appears to be using Julie’s movie-set version of the flat as the “real” thing. Richard Ayoade is again on glorious form playing the dyspeptic and ultra-opinionated fellow film student Patrick who makes a very cruel joke about his editor’s baldness. (Did Ayoade improvise that bit?) For the first film, I found myself wondering, Ayoade’s presence aside, at the austere absence of comedy or irony that might with any other film-maker be an important part of telling Julie’s story. (I said it might have made the subject for an early novel by Muriel Spark or AN Wilson.) For this second film, the keynote is still certainly seriousness – intellectual seriousness and artistic seriousness. We are not invited to find anything precious or indulgent in Julie’s life, and in some way, of course, Anthony’s awful fate guards against that reaction. Yet perhaps it simply a function of a second film making the characters more familiar, but the bloodstream-temperature of the movie is heightened; for me, there was less detachment. I found myself more invested in everything that was happening. This second part makes its own kind of emotional sense and retrospective sense of the first film, too. As ever with movies like this, some of what you might call the reading pleasure comes in wondering what has been taken from the director’s own life, what has been changed, what has been suppressed or misremembered. (I wondered this, a little, about her first film, Unrelated from 2007.) With a film about a film about a life, the puzzlement-slash-pleasure is redoubled. This rich and mysterious film is a real achievement.

2/3/2022,"The International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach has promised to support tennis player Peng Shuai if she calls for an investigation into her sexual harassment allegations. Speaking at a press conference in Beijing, Bach also revealed that Peng would enter the closed-loop system at the Games – which requires a series of negative PCR tests – for a face-to-face meeting with him in the coming days.  “We will have the meeting,” said Bach. “I am very happy and very grateful to Peng Shuai. She will enter the closed loop to have the meeting that she also wants. Once the Covid procedures have finished we will have that meeting.” Concerns have persisted for Peng ever since the former women’s No 1 doubles player alleged that a former Chinese vice premier, Zhang Gaoli, had sexually assaulted her in the past. After that post, she was absent from public view for nearly three weeks. The IOC then set up a call with Peng to establish she was safe. Later in December she then claimed that she had never accused anyone of sexually assaulting her, adding that a social media post she had made had been misunderstood. Zhang has not commented on the matter. Bach said that a face-to-face meeting was a logical next step to establish whether what Peng was saying via a teleconference was repeated in real life. He added: “It’s not only a sign of respect but a necessity to respect her and listen to her and how she sees the situation, how she wants to live her life.” “We are step by step trying to find out if she wants to have the inquiry,” he said. “Of course we would also support her in this, but it must be her decision. It’s her life, it’s her allegations. “We have heard the allegations, we have heard the withdrawal. We will have this personal meeting and continue this conversation. And then we will know better also about her physical integrity, her mental state, when we can finally meet in person.” Many believe that Peng is being restricted by the Chinese government and is unable to speak freely. However, Bach said he didn’t believe that was the case. “We know from her explanations during the video conferences that she is living here in Beijing,” he said. “She is reporting that she can move freely, that she is spending time with her family and friends, And now we will be able to do the next step in a personal meeting to convince us in person of her well being and her state of mind.”",Sport/Sport,IOC president vows to support Peng Shuai over sexual harassment allegations,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/03/ioc-president-vows-to-support-peng-shuai-over-sexual-harassment-allegations
2/3/2022,"The wound from the failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup is still raw, elite sport is a business of marginal gains and the USMNT is often forced to play road games in heat, humidity and at altitude. But the choice of freezing St Paul for this game exuded insecurity when the US should have projected strength.  A nation that beat Mexico three times in 2021 felt it should make the worst team in the qualifying group – one that is winless with eight losses in 11 qualifiers – trek to the frozen north in the hope of demoralising them and to ensure they’d have less support in the stands than if the match was played in California, Texas or Florida. This was underdog behaviour and a gratuitous, contrived gut check given the talent gap between the sides. The spectacle of players in head and face coverings and the goalkeeper Matt Turner being told by the referee to take off his handwarming quarterback pouch was absurd. It was also an irresponsible choice as the windchill dipped to -14F (-25C) at kickoff. The Canada-adjacent location reduced the travel time for Gregg Berhalter’s side after their loss in Ontario last Sunday but at the cost of the weather raising the injury risk given the strain that low temperatures place on the body. Not to mention the threat to fans and stadium workers from conditions the National Weather Service described as “dangerously cold”, with the chance of “frost bite in as little as 20 minutes for those without sufficient clothing”. Indeed, two Honduran players had to come off, reportedly to be treated for hypothermia. The “Snow Clasico” is legendary but the frost fetish has gone too far. It’s the World Cup, not the Winter Olympics. After this, and Canada’s hosting of Mexico in frigid Edmonton last November, it’s time for Fifa to set minimum temperature rules in the interests of safety and fair play. When you’re hot, you’re hot – as they don’t say in Minnesota in February. While the USMNT’s record deep freeze dominated the American agenda, Canada are in such scorching form that they’re scoring by accident. In one of the strangest goals of this (or any) qualifying campaign, the ball arced over the goalkeeper and into the net from an acute angle after a deflection hit the 38-year-old captain, Atiba Hutchinson, in the back while he was lying on his side and facing away from the goal. If that opener for Canada in their 2-0 away win over El Salvador was a fluke, their table-topping status is not. They’ve won six successive games and are the only unbeaten team in the Octagonal. John Herdman’s men are eight points clear of fourth-placed Panama with three fixtures left. Jonathan David’s solo injury-time clincher was a goal more reflective of the team’s character: direct, fast, self-assured and gleefully seizing the moment. Even if the scoreline suggests it was an easy game, it was tough to adjust from Sunday’s win over the US in freezing conditions in Hamilton to the heat and humidity of San Salvador. “This was one of the toughest places I have ever been,” Stephen Eustaquio said after the game. “Hard grass, hard environment, the weather was very hot. ... A lot of noise everywhere. But we stood together. We had some hard moments during the game, but at the same time we knew it was normal and we wanted a nine-point window and we got it.” While Canada are all but assured of a place at Qatar 2022, the US aren’t in a bad position themselves even if this has been an uneven qualifying campaign so far. Berhalter’s team were effective on Wednesday and the bold decision to name the out-of-sorts Christian Pulisic among the substitutes paid off when he scored soon after coming off the bench. But Honduras are so bad that it would be rash to attach great significance to the performance and premature to declare an end to the squad’s persistent difficulty with scoring in first halves and from set pieces. The US have found the net 16 times in 11 qualifiers and seven of those goals came against Los Catrachos. Turner didn’t get to warm his hands by making a save. It was so easy that Berhalter snapped a selfie with fans late in the second half as the US led 3-0. Still, the result means the US can feel confident ahead of a tricky concluding trio of fixtures next month: away to Mexico, home to Panama and on the road against Costa Rica. Canada are almost out of reach but three more points will probably be enough for the US to qualify automatically as one of the top three. Panama’s 1-0 loss to Mexico left them four points adrift of the second-placed US. However, the plausible scenario of the Americans losing to Mexico next month while Panama beat Honduras would send stress levels soaring. If that scenario plays out avoiding defeat in Orlando against Panama will be imperative before a tricky trip to Costa Rica for the final qualifier. The midfield pair impressed on Wednesday with Yunus Musah on the bench and Tyler Adams injured and looked like viable back-up options. De la Torre was kinetic in his first international start while Acosta was involved in all three goals. His free kick was superbly headed in by Weston McKennie for the opener. Another Acosta set-piece was turned in by Walker Zimmerman later in the first half. An Acosta delivery led to the third goal as well, as Berhalter’s side finally figured out how to score from set pieces in this qualifying campaign. Dallas is a contender to host a semi-final in the 2026 World Cup and it’s having a big say in 2022 as well thanks to the city’s MLS club’s impressive youth development. Acosta, McKennie and 2013 first-round draft pick Zimmerman were among five FC Dallas alumni named in the US starting XI, with a current Frisco-based young player, Jesus Ferreira, making a substitute appearance. (Not forgetting the injured Chris Richards.) The pipelines in Texas aren’t only delivering oil. The freezing temperatures in Minnesota meant it was not a night for delicate touches on a lumpy, concrete-hard surface. The ball must have felt like a rock, if numbed toes could feel it at all. Yet McKennie’s jinking run and delicate pass to set up a chance for Tim Weah in the 50th minute was a highlight. With Pulisic a spectator until after the hour mark, McKennie ran the show and scored a soothing early goal. It would be no surprise if the Juventus midfielder is the US’s most indispensable player in Qatar, if they make it, this autumn/winter. Without the kind of midfield control that McKennie can provide, Pulisic’s influence on games is liable to be sporadic against strong opposition.",Sport/Football,Lessons from Concacaf qualifying: US insecurity in the cold and Canada’s surge,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/03/concacaf-world-cup-qualifying-soccer-usmnt-canada
2/3/2022,"Europe could soon enter a “long period of tranquillity” that amounts to a “ceasefire” in the pandemic thanks to the less severe Omicron variant, high levels of immunity and the arrival of warmer spring weather, the World Health Organization has said. In an upbeat assessment, Hans Kluge, the WHO’s Europe director, said the region was in a position of “higher protection” that could “bring us enduring peace”, even if a new, more virulent variant than Omicron should emerge.  Kluge said the 53-country region had recorded 12 million new coronavirus cases last week, the highest single weekly total of the pandemic, with about 22% of all tests returning a positive result. However, hospital admissions, although growing, were not rising at the same rate and the number of patients in intensive care was not increasing significantly, he said. The number of deaths across the region was also starting to plateau. Kluge said “a large capital of vaccine-derived and natural immunity, a favourable seasonality pause and a lower severity of the Omicron variant” meant governments now had “a singular opportunity to take control of transmission”. This opened up the prospect of “a long period of tranquillity and a much higher level of population defence” against any fresh resurgence in infection rates, he said. The optimistic forecast comes days after Kluge said it was “plausible” the region was “moving towards a kind of pandemic endgame”. But Kluge stressed on Thursday that authorities must use the respite constructively, by continuing vaccine and booster campaigns, protecting the most vulnerable, promoting individual responsibility and intensifying surveillance to detect new variants. “I believe it is possible to respond to new variants that will inevitably emerge without reinstalling the kind of disruptive measures we needed before,” he said. But he added it must now be a top priority to ensure all countries are equally well protected. “This demands a drastic and uncompromising increase in vaccine-sharing across borders,” Kluge said. “We cannot accept vaccine inequity for one more day – vaccines must be for everyone, in the remotest corner of our vast region and beyond.” On the eve of World Cancer Day, the WHO regional director also noted the “catastrophic impact” the pandemic had had on people with cancer as health systems struggled with screening, diagnosis and treatment during the past two years. During the early stages of the pandemic, he said, diagnosis of invasive tumours fell by 44% in Belgium, colorectal screenings decreased by 46% in Italy, and in Spain the number of cancers diagnosed in 2020 was 34% lower than expected. The situation in many countries had improved since then, he said, but “the knock-on effect of this disruption will be felt for years” and any respite from the pandemic must be used immediately to reduce backlogs for chronic care services.",News/World news,"Covid: Europe set for ‘long period of tranquillity’ in pandemic, says WHO",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/europe-set-for-long-period-of-tranquillity-in-pandemic-says-who
2/3/2022,"Fifa will request more details about the appointment of a coach accused of sexually abusing and harassing female players in Barbados after it was suggested that he was given “positive recommendations” to take over as director of football in St Kitts and Nevis by the president of the Barbados Football Association. Ahmed Mohamed, a former Somalia defender who has managed Barbados and the British Virgin Islands, was appointed by Atiba Harris – the president of the SKNFA – in September.  According to Harris, Mohamed stepped down as technical director of the BFA last year for “family reasons” and was chosen after Harris “reached out personally” to the BFA president, Randy Harris, who is the president of the Caribbean Football Union (CFU) and a vice-president of Concacaf. Mohamed left his post in Barbados in February 2021 after 27 players from the senior women’s team signed a letter at the start of that month urging the BFA to investigate claims made by one of their teammates. It understood that she alleged the coach raped her at a hotel when she was 18 and that she previously received a series of unwelcome text messages from him. The player also claimed that she was threatened by senior members of the BFA after attempting to report her clams to the police. Another player alleged that Mohamed sexually abused her over a period of three years, starting when she was 13. Last February some players also started an online petition demanding a “thorough investigation be carried out immediately”, after no immediate action was taken. “We didn’t put his name because we were afraid,” said one player who did not want to be named. “In our country, it’s hard for someone to claim that kind of thing, especially in sports.” Mohamed left his post three weeks later, although his identity was not made public by the BFA after Randy Harris said he had been “legally advised not to”. Harris, re-elected unopposed as president of the CFU last year, refused to say whether Mohamed had resigned or been sacked. “We have policies in place to make clear that we will not accept any form of misconduct or inappropriate behaviour,” he said in a statement. “We will always act in the best interests of our organisation and of football in Barbados.” Randy Harris, asked whether he would like to comment about the claim he recommended Mohamed, replied: “No sir.” Neither Atiba Harris nor Mohamed responded to questions from the Guardian. Dave Browne – the father of the St Kitts captain Phoenetia, who plays for the German second division club SC Sand – said during a phone-in show on Freedom FM last week that he was “deeply concerned” about the situation. “He has been accused of sexually abusing girls – we can’t take that lightly,” Browne said. “As a father of one of the players, I’m very concerned from all angles that the girls could be in danger. Atiba Harris needs to come and tell us why he has appointed him. He owes it to the nation.” Harris appeared as a guest on Freedom FM on Monday to defend the appointment. “We did our due diligence regarding Mr Mohamed,” he said. “I reached out personally to the president of CFU [Randy Harris], who is also the vice-president of Concacaf, and also other officials within Concacaf and Fifa. We had positive feedback, positive recommendations and we decided to move forward. Those allegations that were made by the gentleman that called in – would the immigration in St Kitts and Nevis let somebody into the country, award them a work permit in such a high position, knowing that something like that was on their back? You tell me.” Harris added: “[Mohamed] actually resigned for family reasons. Ahmed is a great guy, a great technical person who is going to do wonders for our country within football. I have every confidence in him.” A spokesperson from Concacaf said: “At no point has anyone from the St Kitts and Nevis FA contacted the Concacaf administration to seek information regarding this individual, or any other prospective employee.” A Fifa spokesperson said: “Given the seriousness of the allegations, Fifa will contact the relevant member associations to request more details about this matter. When it comes to misconduct and abuse in football, we wish to reiterate that Fifa takes any allegations reported to it very seriously.” Atiba Harris, a former defender who retired last year, said that restructuring the SKNFA had been his priority since he was elected in August. “I came back here to St Kitts after finishing my career professionally to contribute back to football and society,” he said. “We selected a team around us and you know you’re going to have some good ones and not so good ones. Yes there are going to be some changes – some people are going to take it the wrong way but changes need to be made to move forward.” In November Jeffrey “Pedro” Hazel’s contract as technical director of the SKNFA was terminated with immediate effect, along with those of three other senior officials. It is understood that Hazel, who guided two of the country’s women’s sides to the final stages of Concacaf qualifying for the first time last year and had a year left on his contract, has launched a legal action.",Sport/Football,Fifa investigates after St Kitts appoint coach accused of sexual abuse,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/03/fifa-investigates-after-st-kitts-appoint-coach-accused-of-sexual-abuse
2/3/2022,"When the leaders of China and Russia meet in Beijing this Friday shortly before the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics, observers of the bilateral relationship will be looking for insights into how this 21st century quasi-alliance is reshaping the postwar world order. It was 50 years ago this month, on 21 February 1972, that the historic handshake between Richard Nixon and Mao Zedong changed the geometry of the cold war. Historians called the visit “the week that changed the world”. It later influenced Washington’s subsequent movement towards détente with Moscow.  Yet, half a century on, with talk of another cold war – this time between the US and China – on the rise, Moscow and Beijing are, instead, inching closer. Amid the unfolding crisis in Ukraine, Beijing last week publicly seconded Moscow’s “security concerns” regarding Nato. “This will be their 38th [meeting] since 2013, [and] is uniquely significant because of the foreign policy challenges each leader is facing at the moment,” David Shullman, senior director of the Global China Hub at the Atlantic Council, said of Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping. “Putin appreciates Chinese public expressions of support for Russia’s position on Ukraine that demonstrate the Kremlin is not isolated internationally,” he said. “For China, Putin’s visit is an important demonstration of support at a time when the US, UK, and other countries are undertaking a diplomatic boycott of the Games.” This week’s meeting will be Xi’s first in-person interaction with a foreign leader in nearly two years. China’s propaganda machine is already in full gear ahead of the event. In state media, the name of the Russian president tops the official list of foreign dignitaries. Earlier this week, the state news agency Xinhua in a long article extolled the friendship between the two countries. “China-Russia leaders’ ‘Winter Olympics appointment’ opens a new chapter in the bilateral relations,” the headline declared. The article has since been republished by other major state-owned websites in the last few days. The Xi-Putin meeting will be closely watched in Washington as well as other major western capitals. Inevitably, according to analysts, the issue of Ukraine will loom large. In 2014, in a show of defiance against fierce western criticism over the annexation of Crimea, Putin turned to Xi to look for an alternative. Beijing showed its support by signing a $400bn, 30-year gas deal. As the crisis in Ukraine brews, Russia is once again facing international pressure and is seeking foreign allies in its standoff with the west. In the current situation, Russia “needs China much more than the other way around”, said Alexander Gabuev, the chair of the Russia in the Asia-Pacific Program at the Carnegie Moscow Centre, during a roundtable discussion on Wednesday. Describing the mood in Moscow, Gabuev said: “China is very pragmatic and has a lot of leverage … China’s bargaining position is strengthened day by day, so it’s better to sign a deal with China now rather than tomorrow.” Putin will enter the meeting with Xi looking to do just that. The Kremlin is embarking on the rare foreign visit with a docket of 15 contracts and agreements it wants to sign with the Chinese leadership, including a joint statement that will “reflect the common views of Russia and China on key global issues, including security issues”. It appears the Kremlin will seek formal Chinese support in its conflict with Nato countries. “Beijing supports Russia’s demands on security guarantees, China shares the stance that security of one country cannot be ensured by means of damaging another country’s security,” said the Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov, adding they were calling for the “creation of efficient mechanisms of ensuring security in Europe through negotiations”. In an article published in the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, Putin also noted joint efforts to expand payments in national currencies and create “mechanisms to offset the negative impact of unilateral sanctions”. US lawmakers have threatened to impose the “mother of all sanctions” if Russia launches a new invasion of Ukraine. Putin will be accompanied by a handful of top diplomatic and energy officials, including his foreign and energy ministers and the Rosneft chief executive, Igor Sechin. That indicates that economic and energy cooperation are likely to be a focus of the talks on Friday. Ushakov said the two sides would also discuss plans for the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline, which would allow Russia to redirect gas away from Europe via its controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline and sell it instead on the Chinese market. However, even if the two sides do strike an agreement, the pipeline would take years to build. The summit will mark Putin’s third trip abroad since the outbreak of coronavirus in late 2019. The two leaders are expected to hold talks on the morning of 4 February and then have a private lunch that “will help them have a maximally open discussion about the most important international and bilateral issues”, Ushakov said. Last month, Beijing announced that the bilateral trade between China and Russia reached nearly $147bn last year – more than twice the figure of $68bn back in 2015 after western sanctions. Last week, senior diplomats from both countries agreed to step up coordination on Asian affairs, in the latest move that signalled even closer ties amid western pressures. “Both Xi and Putin will underscore (yet again) that their relationship is the best it’s been in history and that the two countries continue to deepen strategic and economic ties, with the subtext being that no amount of US-led efforts to derail their leadership or strategic interests will succeed,” said Shullman. Prof Sharyl Cross, the director of the Kozmetsky Center at St Edward’s University in Austin, Texas, agreed. “The two leaders will emphasise their burgeoning bilateral security and economic ties and common perspectives on a range of global security issues presenting a challenge to American global influence and the liberal international order,” she said, adding that Xi and Putin were likely to also include discussion of the role of Nato in Europe. Cross said both Moscow and Beijing would stand to benefit from division among democratic nations and the transatlantic security alliance in responding to the Ukraine conflict. “The United States and its allies should be thinking about how to avoid driving these two major powers closer and ways simultaneous challenges on the part of both Russia and China in different regions (Europe and Asia) might be managed,” she said. But Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing, downplayed the significance of the forthcoming meeting. He said he did not expect anything new to come out of it. “China has said what it has said about recent events. Beijing’s statements can be seen as very much pro-Russia, but with some major reservations,” he said. “For example, China has never committed to any military involvement in case of a war. And likewise, despite Putin’s previous support for Beijing’s position on Taiwan, he had never committed to be involved militarily in case of a major conflict [between China and the US], either.” For Shi, the type of foreign dignitaries that descended in Beijing this week is, instead, more telling about the current state of affairs on the eve of the 50th anniversary of Nixon’s visit to Beijing. These leaders range from Putin to Egypt’s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, to the president of Kazakhstan, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. “From those who diplomatically boycotted the Winter Games and those who came to Beijing, we can see some indication that the world is indeed heading towards the direction of bi-polarisation.”",News/World news,Xi-Putin summit: Russia inches closer to China as ‘new cold war’ looms,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/xi-putin-summit-russia-inches-closer-china-new-cold-war-looms
2/3/2022,"The Black Cop, a short film commissioned by Guardian Documentaries and supported by the BFI Doc Society Fund (awarding National Lottery funding), has been nominated for a BAFTA Film Award. Announced today (Thursday 3 February), The Black Cop has been revealed as one of the five films nominated in the British Short Film category at the 75th British Academy Film Awards. The winners of the 2022 BAFTA Film Awards will be announced on Sunday 13 March.  This is the first time a Guardian-commissioned documentary has been nominated for a BAFTA Film Award. The nomination from BAFTA follows on from the success of several other Guardian documentaries, including Colette that won the best short documentary Oscar last year and Black Sheep, which made the Oscar shortlist in 2019. The Black Cop, which is free to watch on the Guardian website, is an intimate portrait of Gamal ‘G’ Turawa, an ex-Metropolitan police officer, who explores his memories of racially profiling and harassing Black people and homophobia in his early career. Now an openly gay man, Turawa’s story is a multi-layered one and sits in the centre of three pivotal moments in recent British history, from the Black communities’ resistance of oppressive policing, to the push for LGBTQIA equality and the aftermath of the west African ‘farming’ phenomenon, where white families took care of Black children outside the remit of local authorities. Cherish Oteka, director and producer of The Black Cop, says: “It is a huge honour to have this important and nuanced story recognised by BAFTA. My work aims to provide a platform for often-marginalised communities to tell their stories on their terms. I have made documentaries that explore identity, discrimination, and institutional bias, but never through the lens of someone who sits on all sides of the conversation. In one person and one story we present a villain, victim and hero and begin to understand the potential that we all have in being any one of these, even all three. It has been heart-warming to see The Black Cop connecting with audiences in this way.” Katharine Viner, editor-in-chief, Guardian News & Media says: “It’s wonderful to see this complex and important story resonate with audiences and for the Guardian’s documentary to be recognised by BAFTA. The nomination is a real honour and a testament to the talented team behind this powerful film.” Lindsay Poulton, head of documentaries, Guardian News & Media, says: “At the Guardian, we are always looking for surprising routes into important, contemporary stories. We are delighted to have had the opportunity to support this story of identity and acceptance, and are proud of the creative and thoughtful documentary that Cherish and the filmmakers have created. It has been a pleasure to witness this film spark insightful conversations at film festivals all over the world and receive this recognition from BAFTA. The Black Cop is a reflection of the Guardian’s documentary strand, helping to bring different perspectives and new ways of thinking to compelling and vital journalism”. Lisa Marie Russo. executive producer for the BFI Doc Society Fund, says: “The BFI Doc Society Fund champions diverse voices and creative approaches to documentary storytelling. The Fund is delighted that this dynamic and deeply original film continues to strike a chord with audiences and now, Bafta voters. Congrats to director/producer Cherish Oteka and producer Emma Cooper for the nomination in this super competitive category, which includes both documentary and fiction films.” Guardian documentaries have won critical acclaim around the world, including an Oscar in 2021 for Colette. Guardian Documentaries play at film festivals around the world and have been recognised with numerous awards, including a Grierson, as well as award wins at the Cannes film festival, Sheffield Doc/Fest and the Aesthetica Short Film Festival. The Black Cop has been screened at Raindance Film Festival, British Shorts Film Festival, Aesthetic Short Film Festival, Out On Film, Atlanta’s International LGBTQ Film Festival, The Pan African Film & Arts Festival, American Black Film Festival, and Leeds International Film Festival. The Black Cop is directed by Cherish Oteka and produced by Emma Cooper. Executive producers for the Guardian are Ekaterina Ochagavia and Jess Gormley, and for the BFI Doc Society Fund is Lisa Marie Russo. The commissioning editor is Lindsay Poulton.

2/3/2022,"After last year’s event was overshadowed by the controversy surrounding Noel Clarke, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta) are hoping that it can regain credibility with its 2022 edition, for which the nominations have been announced. Science-fiction blockbuster Dune leads the way with 11 nominations, while the Jane Campion-directed western The Power of the Dog follows with eight, and Kenneth Branagh’s autobiographical drama Belfast has six. In 2021, Clarke had been given Bafta’s outstanding contribution to British cinema award, but shortly afterwards the Guardian revealed 20 women had made allegations of harassment and bullying against him, and the award was suspended. (Clarke denies sexual misconduct.) Bafta subsequently announced that it would not hand out honorary awards until after a review had been conducted.  In a press briefing, Bafta chair Krishnendu Majumdar said the decision to review the decision-making process behind its honorary awards had been taken before the Clarke scandal, while Bafta co-chair Sara Putt added that: “We wanted to make the process more rigorous … It’s about people we should know, rather than people we do know.” The Clarke scandal also overshadowed the progress Bafta appeared to make over the diversity of its award nominees, after a series of rules changes in response to years of complaints. In 2021, four women were nominated for best director and the majority of acting nominees were non-white. This year the numbers are not quite so spectacular, but three women – Jane Campion, Julia Ducournau and Audrey Diwan – are up for best director, out of six nominees, while seven of the 18 acting nominations are people of colour, including Will Smith up for best actor for King Richard, and Tessa Thompson for best actress for Passing. Putt said Bafta was “very excited” about the diversity of its nominees, while Majumdar said: “We’re delighted to be able to shine a spotlight on such phenomenal breadth of stories and performances.” Majumdar also drew attention to the achievement of British independent film After Love, the directorial debut of film-maker Aleem Khan, which scored four nominations: for outstanding British film, best actress for Joanna Scanlan, and outstanding debut and best director for Khan. Mainstream cinema is well represented, with most nominations going to the epic Dune adaptation directed by Denis Villeneuve. It scored heavily in the behind-the-camera categories, including nominations for best special visual effects and best cinematography, as well as best film and best original screenplay for Villeneuve. The recent James Bond film No Time to Die also did well, with five nominations including outstanding British film and best special visual effects, as is Steven Spielberg’s remake of West Side Story, including best supporting actress and actor for Ariana DeBose and Mike Faist. However, the current awards-season powerhouses The Power of the Dog and Belfast, which are expected to dominate the major prizes at both the Baftas and the Oscars, feature heavily in the headline awards: both are up for best film, while several principal cast members – Benedict Cumberbatch, Kodi Smit-McPhee and Jesse Plemons for the former, and Caitríona Balfe and Ciarán Hinds for the latter – all have acting nods. One surprise omission from the line-up is the Princess Diana biopic Spencer, starring Kristen Stewart, which was expected to do well after its successful launch at the Venice film festival last year. However, it failed to secure a single nomination, including Stewart for best actress, which may have saved Bafta president Prince William from an awkward encounter. Also completely omitted is The Souvenir Part II, which like its predecessor The Souvenir from director Joanna Hogg, has been completely shut out. The Black Cop, directed by Cherish Oteka and commissioned by Guardian Documentaries, is nominated for best British short film. Following the Oscar win for the Guardian’s documentary Colette, this is the first time a Guardian film has been nominated for a Bafta. The Guardian’s editor-in-chief Katharine Viner said: “The nomination is a real honour and a testament to the talented team behind this powerful film.” Oteka said: “It has been heartwarming to see The Black Cop connecting with audiences in this way.” Bafta has already announced the line-up for its Rising Star award, voted on by the public, which includes Bond actor Lashana Lynch and Smit-McPhee. The winners will be announced at a ceremony at the Royal Albert Hall on 3 February, with Rebel Wilson acting as host. After the virtual event conducted under social distancing conditions in 2021, Bafta say they are planning an in-person ceremony, with a “full” audience while conforming to government guidelines.",Arts/Film,Dune and The Power of the Dog lead Baftas as awards move on from Noel Clarke,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/03/dune-and-the-power-of-the-dog-lead-baftas-as-awards-move-on-from-noel-clarke

Then he had an election hiatus, returning in 2005 when he voted Conservative as a protest against Tony Blair going to war in Iraq. After that, he voted Tory again, “then Ukip came along and I thought: yeah, let’s go with these”Amuse bouche Bill once ran the San Diego marathon dressed as Elvis Presley Lin We talked about trans issues. I talked about men in prison saying they were women and transferring into women’s prisons; cases where women had been abused. I explained about women’s safe spaces being eroded and how we weren’t allowed to discuss it. He didn’t know about it and wasn’t particularly interested. Bill I haven’t got a duck in the paddling race for the trans thing. Do whatever you want to do, live and let live. Lin It’s all bonkers in a way, like the push to stop people talking about mothers. Now they’re “birth-givers” or “womb-havers” or whatever. Bill We agreed about free speech – you have to debate the daylight out of it, otherwise you close everyone down. Lin We talked about immigration. I was really affected by the people drowning in the Channel – I felt angry. We are one of the richest countries in the world, and there’s no legal safe route for people to come here. They’re doing these desperate things, paying thousands of pounds to greedy bastards, and taking such risks. Bill It was terrible – how can anyone say it isn’t? What you’ve got to separate is those people unfortunately dying, and the overall situation. My stance is: no immigration across the board. What good is it to the people in the UK? We need to be more self-sufficient. The NHS needs more doctors. We should be training people who are in the UK now, rather than filching off other countries. Lin I said I wasn’t bothered about the interests of the UK – I have a more internationalist perspective. Who is the “we”? Does it include all the people who have come as immigrants in the past, their children and their children’s children? Or does it only include white men from up the road in Morpeth, where there is probably a Chinese restaurant, an Indian restaurant, and that’s it. Bill I’ve worked in Angola, and the Middle East – I’ve seen the disparity between the people who have and the people who don’t. My fear is that lower-earning people in the UK would start sliding that way as too many people come in. Social services cannot cope, the health services are struggling. There should be a referendum on immigration. Lin We agreed the House of Lords should be abolished. He’s a republican, and I’m not a monarchist. And we agreed there should not have been a war in Iraq. Bill Neither of us like Tony Blair. Lin I wouldn’t call it common ground. Lin We got on to football and I said I thought taking the knee was an important token gesture and demonstrated to fans that footballers don’t support racism. Bill I don’t care whether they take the knee, but how do you measure if it’s been effective? And is it not getting like a cult? Everyone should be treated fairly. Lin I asked him whether he would do something if he heard someone being racially abused in the restaurant. And he said no. That kind of “live and let live” approach means he doesn’t have to engage with things that make him uncomfortable. Bill I don’t believe in getting involved in arguments with people. I don’t want to get punched in the face. Bill She seemed to be extreme left in a way that didn’t solve anything. She regards herself as a citizen of the world, and I thought: we’re back in the 60s, get in the minivan and fire up the doobies. Lin The food was good, but I couldn’t wait to leave.
