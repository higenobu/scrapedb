2/3/2022,"The FBI has said a series of hoax bomb threats targeting US historically Black colleges and universities, or HBCUs, are being investigated as racially motivated hate crimes.  More than a dozen HBCUs reported bomb threats on Tuesday, the first day of Black history month. On Monday, six HBCUs received similar threats, forcing them to cancel classes for thousands of students. A number of HBCUs faced simultaneous threats from anonymous callers earlier in January. “These threats are being investigated as racially or ethnically motivated violent extremism and hate crimes,” the FBI said in a statement on Wednesday. “Although no explosive devices have been found at any of the locations, the FBI takes all threats with the utmost seriousness and we are committed to thoroughly and aggressively investigating these threats.” NBC reported that six “tech savvy” juveniles had been identified as persons of interest. The network said the group were “using sophisticated methods to try to disguise the source of the threats, which appear to have a racist motivation”. CNN reported that at least 14 HBCUs received bomb threats on Tuesday, including Coppin State University, Mississippi Valley State University, Fort Valley State University and Howard University, in Washington DC and the alma mater of the vice-president, Kamala Harris. According to school officials, threats were sent on Monday to Howard; Bethune-Cookman University in Daytona Beach, Florida; Southern University and A&M in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Albany State University in Albany, Georgia; Bowie State University in Bowie, Maryland; and Delaware State University in Dover. On Tuesday, Miguel Cardona, US secretary of education, said: “Our Historically Black Colleges and Universities have again been targets of disturbing threats. My team will continue to work with students, faculty, and alumni to make sure HBCUs continue to be a safe place for students to learn. Threats of violence will not be tolerated, period.” Earlier in January, at least eight HBCUs reported bomb threats. All reported “all-clears” the same day, the Washington Post reported. It was unclear if the threats on Monday and Tuesday were connected to the earlier threats. In a statement, Damon Hewitt, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, called the bomb threats “a fresh reminder of the ongoing threats to Black life and opportunity, and the continued presence of racist hate … designed to undermine the mission of HBCUs and to strike at the heart of the sense of pride they instill in the Black community”. Hewitt also tied the threats to political controversies over the place of race in US education, particularly the teaching of history and in college admissions, and attacks on voting rights. “These forces,” he said, “are all connected to the purpose of racism and white supremacy, to degrade, humiliate, and intimidate Black people at every possible turn, to the point where no place and no institution is safe”.

2/3/2022,"For a long time it wasn’t pretty, but with this Senegal side it rarely is. Not that they will mind. Senegal are the great underachievers of the Africa Cup of Nations and if they beat Cameroon or Egypt on Sunday to lift the trophy for the first time, nobody will much care how they did it. Aliou Cissé’s job is not to entertain but to win.  This was a game that followed the classic Cissé pattern: rugged solidity to start, gradually squeezing the opponent into mistakes before late strikes: eight of the nine goals Senegal have scored in Cameroon have come after the hour. The breakthrough here came on 70 minutes, a corner dropping in the box for the Paris Saint-Germain centre-back Abdou Diallo to hook in. The second was knocked in by Idrissa Gueye after Sadio Mané had outmuscled Bouna Sarr before cutting the ball back. Mané then got the decisive third with a deft finish on the break. In truth, they could easily have had the lead before half-time. Twice the Ethiopian referee Bamlak Tessema awarded Senegal penalties and twice overturned them after VAR reviews. First Hervé Koffi, the Burkinabé keeper, clattered into Cheikhou Kouyaté but the video showed his fist had – just – made contact with the ball before the Palace midfielder’s skull. Koffi, though, ended up being stretchered off. Given how strict the interpretation of handball in this tournament has been, the second decision was less clear-cut: Idrissa Gueye’s shot did strike the elbow of the central defender Edmond Tapsoba, but it was by his side as he turned away. Zimbabwe, who conceded a similar penalty late on against Senegal in their first game, may have looked on with surprise. But this was not just about events on the pitch. For the Burkinabé players, perhaps, their anthem had additional significance tonight. It was written by the former president Thomas Sankara, who changed the name of the country from Upper Volta in 1984 and is widely regarded as the father of the nation. He was assassinated in 1987 during a coup; last year, his former deputy Blaise Compaoré, who succeeded him as president, was put on trial in absentia for his murder. Since the military coup on 23 January, though, all judicial proceedings have halted. The players had watched the news of the coup on a television in their hotel in Garoua. A fortnight earlier, the deposed president Roch Marc Christian Kaboré had sent them a good luck message. Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, the leader of the coup, spoke to the manager, Kamou Malo, himself a former police chief. The curfew that the military had imposed in Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso, having been ignored in the celebrations after the quarter-final win over Tunisia, was lifted for tonight’s match. “The events are extra motivation for us,” Malo said, “because we know that whatever we do will be remembered by our people.” Even without that context, this is an achievement that deserves to be remembered. This was Burkina Faso’s third semi-final in nine years, a remarkable statistic for a nation that had previously only once progressed beyond the group stage – and that on home soil. This is a fine young squad, and the way it fought on to pull one back though Ibrahim Blati Touré’s kneed volley spoke of their character. There is no reason this squad could not go even further in the next few years. This Senegal squad, though, is concerned only about the here and now. Sunday their second successive final, their third in total, and they will not have many better chances finally to win their first Cup of Nations than with this group of players and this most pragmatic of managers.",Sport/Football,Sadio Mané seals Senegal’s passage to Afcon final as Burkina Faso blown away,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/02/burkina-faso-senegal-africa-cup-of-nations-semi-final-match-report

2/3/2022,"Reno, Nevada, hasn’t recorded a single drop of rain during the entire month of January, a record that goes back nearly nearly 130 years. The city, tucked on the Nevada-California border, has borne the brunt of weather extremes in recent months.  Reno experienced its wettest October on record last year, according to the National Weather Service, after an annual amount of rain fell on northern Nevada in just two days. Close to 3 in of rain was recorded at Reno-Tahoe international airport during that storm, ranking the third highest of any month since 1893. This month’s lack of precipitation, on the other extreme, beat out a record from January 1966 when less than 0.01 of an inch was measured during the month. “We’ve had whiplash from wet to dry,” Dan McEvoy, regional climatologist at the Western Regional Climate Center told the Reno Gazette-Journal. It's official... we just had the driest January in Reno ever! Hopefully we'll see some moisture in February. We need it. #News4 pic.twitter.com/pOlG6HjDkx Reno doesn’t stand alone. Across the American west, a region that’s been mired in drought, autumn rains wreaked havoc. The city of Los Angeles broke a rainfall record set in 1936 and officials had to rescue residents and vehicles out of the surging Los Angeles River. Areas of Arizona received up to 400% of average precipitation during its 2021 monsoon season. Rain poured on the parched Pacific north-west in November causing floods and flows. Creeks that been reduced to a trickle in the preceding months overran their banks in northern California while record snowfall measured 214 in in the central Sierra as December came to a close. The super-storms were enough to recharge some dwindling reservoirs, bringing huge swaths of the west out of the exceptional drought classification. The state of California finally escaped the worst drought categories (as deemed by the US Drought Monitor) at the end of January. But even with the deluge, the region is now bracing for yet another prolonged period without precipitation. Along with Reno’s record, other cities across the west broke dryness records, including Las Vegas and Sacramento. “Much of the region has experienced alternating periods of wet and dry weather since the water year began on October 1, 2021,” wrote Brad Rippey, a meteorologist with the US Department of Agriculture in the latest US Drought Monitor summary for the west last week. Variability isn’t exactly unheard of in the west, where conditions often change between the seasons – but heat has shifted the stakes. A warming trend, driven by climate change, has quickened the pace of drying between storms and exacerbated issues when rain and snow doesn’t show up during the typically wet winter months. “We really depend on that snowpack sitting up in the mountains moving into the summer months,” Simeral said, adding that spiking temperatures were causing the “snowpack to melt out prematurely – and that causes problems”. Forecasts show that February isn’t likely to offer much of a reprieve. “Extremely dry conditions – with zero rain or snow in most spots – are likely to continue across all of California and indeed much of the west into mid-February,” climate scientist Daniel Swain wrote on Twitter at the end of January. “Temperatures will also warm to above average levels, increasing mid-winter snowmelt in mountains.” Swain also noted that January 2022 was the driest on record for data going back 40 years across parts of the west. “It’s not impossible there could be a late February or March comeback – it has happened before,” he said. “But unfortunately the current trend is pretty vividly illustrating why I was so frustrated with folks claiming that the drought was functionally over after a very wet October and December 2021.” Jan 2022 was driest Jan on record in https://t.co/iysBhMM6JZ dataset, which goes back ~40 years, across most of central CA & pockets of interior NorCal--as well as most of NV, UT, & western CO. Will be interesting to see century-long NOAA records in a few days. #CAwx #NVwx #UTwx pic.twitter.com/xPpugpFmEF Also this week, officials announced that California’s crucial snowpack is melting quickly. Ending last year at roughly 160% of average, it’s plummeted to below average with weeks of dryness ahead. Across the state, the snowpack came in at 92% of average according to the California department of water resources, which released results of their snow survey on 1 February. “We are definitely still in a drought. A completely dry January shows how quickly surpluses can disappear,” said Karla Nemeth, DWR director, in a statement. “The variability of California weather proves that nothing is guaranteed and further emphasizes the need to conserve and continue preparing for a possible third dry year.” In Reno, the last notable amount of precipitation was a small snow event that occurred on 29 December, and forecasts show February isn’t likely to offer much of a reprieve. “There is essentially a zero chance we will see anything for the next 10-12 days” officials at the National Weather Service in Reno wrote on Wednesday about the forecast for rain and snow. They added that there was only a 35% chance that the greater Reno area will see any measurable precipitation through 17 February. “That’s not super hopeful for the first half of February which tends to be a solid month of precipitation. We shall look towards the second half of February and March for redemption.”",News/US news,Dry January: Reno goes a month with no rain for the first time in nearly 130 years,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/02/reno-nevada-rain-january-drought
2/3/2022,"The Savile row: your questions answered about Boris Johnson’s false claims that Keir Starmer failed to prosecute sex offender Jimmy Savile.  Speculation began circulating online in 2020 that Starmer had a role in the decision not to prosecute the TV and radio presenter before his death in 2011. Shortly after Savile’s death, hundreds of his victims said he had abused them in hospitals, schools and on the sets of BBC programmes. Police on several occasions had investigated abuse claims against Savile while he was alive, and he was interviewed under caution in 2009 by Surrey police but no arrest was made. Starmer, the current Labour party leader, was the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and head of the CPS from 2008 until 2013. This has prompted claims online, particularly among far-right activists and so-called “paedophile hunters”, that Starmer had a role in a decision not to prosecute. Amid calls for his resignation over “partygate” claims, Johnson said on Monday that Starmer “used his time prosecuting journalists and failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile”. After facing criticism for his comments from lawyers representing Savile’s victims, the Speaker of the House Lindsay Hoyle, and several senior Conservatives, Johnson on Wednesday doubled down on his claims. The prime minister refused to withdraw the comments and told MPs: “I am informed that in 2013 the right honourable gentleman apologised and took full responsibility for what had happened on his watch.” No. The CPS has confirmed that there is no reference to any involvement from Starmer in the decision-making within an official report examining the case. Surrey police consulted the CPS for advice about the allegations after interviewing Savile’s victims, according to a 2013 CPS statement made by Starmer as DPP. The official report, written by Alison Levitt QC, found that in October 2009 the CPS lawyer responsible for the cases – who was not Starmer – advised that no prosecution could be brought on the grounds that none of the complainants were “prepared to support any police action”. Levitt said in the report that Savile might have been prosecuted if the police and prosecutors had taken a different approach. After the publication of the Levitt report in 2013 Starmer apologised for the CPS’ shortcomings, not his own. Starmer said: “I would like to take the opportunity to apologise for the shortcomings in the part played by the CPS in these cases. “These were errors of judgment by experienced and committed police officers and a prosecuting lawyer acting in good faith and attempting to apply the correct principles. That makes the findings of Ms Levitt’s report more profound and calls for a more robust response.” There is no hard evidence as yet that the Tories are “dead-catting” – introducing a shocking or sensationalist topic to divert discourse away from a more damaging topic. But Lynton Crosby, the Australian political strategist nicknamed the Wizard of Oz, has been hired to advise Johnson during the current crisis, the prime minister told Tory MPs on Monday. Johnson has previously praised an unnamed Australian political strategist – widely thought to be Crosby – for suggesting the tactic when losing an argument. “The facts are overwhelmingly against you, and the more people focus on the reality the worse it is for you and your case. Your best bet in these circumstances is to perform a manoeuvre that a great campaigner describes as ‘throwing a dead cat on the table, mate’,” Johnson wrote in a Telegraph column in 2013. “That is because there is one thing that is absolutely certain about throwing a dead cat on the dining room table – and I don’t mean that people will be outraged, alarmed, disgusted. That is true, but irrelevant. “The key point, says my Australian friend, is that everyone will shout ‘Jeez, mate, there’s a dead cat on the table!’; in other words they will be talking about the dead cat, the thing you want them to talk about, and they will not be talking about the issue that has been causing you so much grief.”",News/Politics,Why is Boris Johnson making false claims about Starmer and Savile?,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/02/why-is-boris-johnson-making-false-claims-about-starmer-and-savile
2/3/2022,"Keir Starmer’s accusation at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday that Boris Johnson was “parroting” conspiracy theories of fascists is not the first time that members of the current government and its backbenchers have faced such claims about their language. The Labour leader levelled his accusation during PMQs after Johnson made false claims about the Labour leader’s blame for the failure to prosecute Jimmy Savile.  In the recent past, controversies have included:  The phrase “cultural Marxism” was used by Suella Braverman in a speech and, separately, by Tory backbenchers in a letter to the Telegraph. Braverman, who has since become the attorney general, was criticised by a leading Jewish group for using the term, a reference to a conspiracy theory often associated with the far right and antisemitism.  The home secretary, Priti Patel, was accused of fanning the flames of far-right racism and violence in a manner akin to that of the former US president Donald Trump. Four charities wrote to her, warning that her words have “harmful consequences”, after she bragged in September 2020 about removing asylum seekers and had also spoken of “do gooders” and “lefty lawyers” offering support to the same people.  Tory MPs who have retweeted Tommy Robinson include Bob Blackman and Nadine Dorries, now culture minister. She shared a tweet from the activist before using far-right tropes against the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, and the writer and journalist Yasmin Alibhai-Brown. Separately, the Tory MP Andrew Rosindell’s Facebook account was found to have joined a “Free Tommy” group.  Johnson’s own use of the word “surrender” to describe legislation passed in 2019 that aimed to block a no-deal Brexit on 31 October was heavily criticised. But he was subsequently joined by formerly moderate Conservative cabinet ministers, Matt Hancock and Nicky Morgan, in defending the language of war, despite pleas by Labour and former Tory MPs to stop suggesting those against Brexit are guilty of treachery or betrayal.  Jacob Rees-Mogg, before he became leader of the House of Commons, defended a tweet in which he quoted the leader of a German far-right party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). The MP insisted in 2019 that he did not endorse the German party’s views but the opinions expressed had “real importance” after tweeting a YouTube video of a speech by Alice Weidel, the leader of the AfD’s 91 deputies in the Bundestag, the German parliament.  Tom Hunt, Tory MP for Ipswich, was accused last year of fuelling racism after appearing to blame crime in his constituency on “certain communities”. Hunt was accused by the Ipswich and Suffolk Council for Racial Equality (ISCRE) of “an ill-judged piece of dogwhistling” in a local newspaper column. Linking crime to immigrant communities, the MP criticised those “who say we should be eternally tolerant of bad behaviour, which may be rife in other countries but is not traditionally in ours” and went on to say that integration should include “learning English, respecting women and obeying our laws”.",News/Politics,The recent history of Tories flirting with far-right rhetoric,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/02/tories-far-right-rhetoric
2/3/2022,"Donald Trump considered issuing a blanket pardon to participants in the January 6 insurrection before he left office, two former advisers have said. The news, from Politico, landed after Trump told an audience on Texas on Saturday he would issue pardons to rioters if elected president again in 2024.  “If I run and if I win,” Trump said in Conroe, Texas, “we will treat those people from January 6 fairly. We will treat them fairly. And if it requires pardons, we will give them pardons because they are being treated so unfairly.” That prompted a storm of protest also fueled by Trump urging followers to protest against prosecutors in New York and Georgia investigating his business affairs and attempted election subversion. Liz Cheney, a Republican on the House committee investigating January 6, said: “Trump uses language he knows caused the January 6 violence; suggests he’d pardon the January 6 defendants, some of whom have been charged with seditious conspiracy; threatens prosecutors; and admits he was attempting to overturn the election. “He’d do it all again if given the chance,” she warned. Supporters urged on by Trump stormed the Capitol in an attempt to stop certification of Joe Biden’s win. More than 100 police officers were injured and seven people died. More than 700 have been charged. The most serious charges, against 11 members of a far-right militia, allege seditious conspiracy. On Wednesday, Politico cited two unnamed advisers as saying Trump asked if he had the power to issue a blanket pardon before leaving office. “Do you think I should pardon them? Do you think it’s a good idea? Do you think I have the power to do it?” Trump reportedly asked one adviser. The other said Trump asked if “everybody that had a Trump sign or everybody who walked into the Capitol” could be pardoned. “He said, ‘Some people think I should pardon them.’ He thought if he could do it, these people would never have to testify or be deposed.” Politico reported that the issue went nowhere, in a period in which Trump faced cabinet resignations, a second impeachment – in which he was acquitted – and even talk of removal via the 25th amendment. One adviser told the website it was thought Pat Cipollone, Trump’s second White House counsel, would quit if Trump pushed too hard. Neither Trump nor Cipollone commented. Politico said one adviser said Trump had been brainstorming more than genuinely considering a blanket pardon. While in office, Trump was liberal with pardons to aides, including Steve Bannon, accused of fraud, and Michael Flynn, who admitted lying to the FBI. He reportedly considered issuing pre-emptive pardons to himself and family members. Trump continues to toy with announcing a run for a second term. A third anonymous adviser told Politico Trump wanted to announce a 2024 run before leaving office on 20 January 2021, but was put off by campaign finance logistics. “At the time, he wanted to not just be the leader of the party, but flat-out show the world that he’s running again and you’re not going to stop him,” the adviser was quoted as saying. One adviser told Politico Trump started saying 2020 was rigged – a lie advanced by the former president and the Republican party – simply to keep his base energised. “He wanted to carry the sense of grievance into the election cycle,” the adviser was quoted as saying. “He said, ‘I’m running again.’”",News/US news,Trump considered blanket pardon for Capitol insurrectionists – report,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/02/trump-blanket-pardon-capitol-attack-january-6
2/3/2022,"The news that the first HRT product will be made available over the counter, comes as the government is gearing up for the launch of its Women’s Health Strategy this spring. The review of women’s health has been a long time coming: it follows a string of women’s healthcare scandals over several decades, including vaginal mesh and epilepsy medication that harmed unborn babies, and the stark finding in Sir Michael Marmot’s 2020 review that women’s life expectancy in the poorest parts of the UK has declined for the first time in 100 years. Some wondered if the latest exercise would be a token gesture.  The decision is a promising indication that it will be more than that. Making vaginal oestrogen tablets – a product called Gina-10 – available over-the-counter is fairly uncontroversial and a sensible place to start. The drug is used to treat vaginal dryness, a symptom estimated to affect up to 80% of menopausal women and which can cause irritation and pain during sex. The drug can also lower the risk of urinary tract infections, which affect some women more frequently during the menopause and often need treatment with antibiotics. And because it only has a tiny dose of locally-acting hormones, it carries none of the risks of global-acting HRT, such as breast cancer and blood clots, making it safe to take indefinitely. “Nobody talks about vaginal dryness,” said Paula Briggs, a consultant in sexual and reproductive health at Liverpool Women’s Hospital, who has welcomed the prospect of the HRT product being dispensed over-the-counter. “Women accept it as part of ageing and it doesn’t have to be. This is an area where we could massively improve quality of life.” A public consultation, ahead of the launch of a Women’s Health Strategy, found that for women aged 40-59 the menopause was the most common health priority. There are suggestions that the government is poised to take action in other areas, with an announcement this week that it plans to ban virginity testing and hymen repair surgery, which is offered at some private clinics. There are other relatively straight-forward steps that could be taken, such as making the provision of abortion pills at home – an emergency measure brought in during the pandemic – a permanent arrangement. The amended rules are set to expire on 30 March. However, there are also deeper changes in health provision that will be required to more fully address the wide range of health inequalities faced by women. The 2020 Cumberlege inquiry identified a culture among medical professionals in which serious medical concerns have been dismissed as “women’s problems” as underpinning some of the failings in women’s health provision. Others have highlighted systemic issues that mean that chances to improve women’s health are routinely missed. For instance, women who suffer from pre-eclampsia during pregnancy are at a far higher risk of heart disease later in life, but are not always offered interventions aimed at improving long-term cardiovascular health. There is also fractured commissioning, that means, for instance, that a woman who needs a hormonal coil to treat menopause symptoms cannot be treated at a sexual health clinic. Some areas of women’s health, such as treatment for endometriosis, have been acutely hit by the backlogs created during the pandemic. And there are significant disparities in experiences and outcomes between women, depending on where they live, ethnicity, education and wealth. Tackling these issues is a far more ambitious task, but, experts hope, is the motivation for having an over-arching strategy rather than making a handful of one-off policy changes. Dr Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: “This isn’t about getting it right for those who know where it is, it’s about getting it right for everybody.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,UK women’s health review set to launch in spring,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/02/uk-womens-health-review-set-to-launch-in-spring
