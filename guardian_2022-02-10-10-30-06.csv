2/10/2022,"The mining company Kepco has failed in its final legal bid to challenge a decision to reject its plans for an open-cut coalmine in the New South Wales Bylong Valley. Environmentalists and members of the Bylong Valley community are now calling on the South Korean company to walk away and sell its land back to farming families rather than submitting a revised development proposal for the project.  The high court on Thursday declined to hear Kepco’s appeal that sought to challenge the NSW Independent Planning Commission’s (IPC) decision in 2019 to reject its development application. The commission refused development approval for the greenfield coalmine, citing the unacceptable impact the mine would have on agricultural land and the environment – including through greenhouse gas emissions – and the costs to future generations. Its decision was subsequently upheld by the NSW land and environment court and the court of appeal. The high court’s decision exhausts the company’s final legal avenue for the project in its current form and brings to an end a lengthy battle for Bylong Valley community members who have fought the project for years. “KEPCO needs to eat some humble pie, pack its bags, and leave,” said Phillip Kennedy, the president of the Bylong Valley Protection Alliance. “KEPCO must not submit a revised project, it must not delay, it must only sell its land back to the farming families of Australia and leave the Bylong Valley for good. “The Bylong Valley community only wants some certainty, and we’re looking forward to that with this win.” The Bylong Valley Protection Alliance had joined as a party to the original judicial review to defend the IPC’s ruling after the commission itself declined to take an active role in proceedings. The alliance’s legal representative, the Environmental Defenders Office, said the high court made its decision based on written submissions, without the need for a hearing. “We could not be more delighted for our clients, the Bylong Valley Protection Alliance, who have dedicated years of their lives to challenging this destructive and inappropriate coal mine proposal,” managing lawyer Rana Koroglu said. “The IPC’s decision to refuse this mine was sound. It was based on the evidence and the science, including evidence about the ‘problematical’ greenhouse gas emissions.” Koroglu said the project would have generated more than 200m tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. She said the commission’s decision had been tested to its limits through the courts and in every appeal had been upheld. “It means the IPC can be assured that an evidence-based decision to reject these kinds of destructive fossil fuel projects in the future is legally supported.” A spokesperson for Kepco said the company was “disappointed with the high court’s decision to dismiss the special leave application”. “KEPCO will now take some time to consider its next steps,” they said.",News/Australia news,NSW activists ‘delighted’ as high court rejects Kepco’s coalmine in Bylong Valley,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/10/nsw-activists-delighted-as-high-court-rejects-kepcos-coalmine-in-bylong-valley
2/10/2022,"The bravery and advocacy of Grace Tame and Brittany Higgins has not only changed the way society thinks about sexual assault but also renewed momentum to solve decades-old problems of economic disparity, according to the head of an expert women’s panel to advise on the New South Wales state budget. Chief Executive Women president, Sam Mostyn, said the combination of pandemic-related upheaval and the emergence of “courageous young women” such as Tame and Higgins had created a fresh appetite to deal with systemic issues holding women back.  On Monday it was announced Mostyn would lead a panel looking at ways to close the gender pay gap, make childcare more affordable and accessible, and get more women into the workforce in New South Wales. They have three months to come up with a “bold and brave” suite of ideas for the NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, to introduce in the budget and develop in future economic plans. Mostyn said the work of Higgins and Tame in raising awareness of gender power dynamics – on display again in Canberra on Wednesday – had created a widespread appetite for change. “2021 was a year where we were given acute evidence of the lack of respect for women,” Mostyn said. “We learned much from the most courageous young women who put the issues of disrespect, safety and discrimination before us as a community. “Whether it’s Brittany Higgins or Grace Tame or Chanel Contos, they made us pay attention to the things that women have known, felt and experienced for decades. “Suddenly, we were having a conversation around the country about an urgent agenda for change.” Mostyn said the pre-budget panel, which includes a range of experts and leaders including the Muslim Women Association chief executive, Maha Abdo, and Council on Early Childhood Development co-chair Leslie Loble, planned to make the most of the “momentum coming out of Covid, not to settle for a return to the systems and structures in place before”. Mostyn said Australia had seen it was possible to quickly implement wide-scale policies “when the the issue was clear and they had a mandate to act” and now the public and the government understood the same could be done to fix other issues. “For women’s economic participation, those structural barriers can be fixed by bold, fast action that involves investment, just as we saw governments do in Covid,” she said. Mostyn also wants the government to look inwards, implementing schemes that make it a best-practice employer and an exemplar to others, and to consider benchmarks for companies tendering for state contracts. Abdo said she was eager for the group to turn the “pain of women who’ve walked this path before us” into real change, and felt there was genuine support from the government and community to do so. Critical to that was lifting up and empowering women with diverse backgrounds. “My wish list would be to see more ethnically diverse women being in more senior positions, whether it’s in business or government,” she said. “Having women with a multicultural background participate without having to feel that ‘I’m so thankful because I’ve got a job’, but instead, ‘The company that is employing me is so blessed that they have me’.” Abdo vowed to keep the pressure on the government to act on the panel’s recommendations at the other end of the process. “We’re not going to sit silently and say ‘all right they tried but it didn’t work’. No, then we can challenge and actively push for it to be implemented,” Abdo said. Loble agreed the pandemic had created an opportunity for real change, with increased attention being paid to caring roles within the community that were often unstable or underpaid, and predominantly done by women. “There’s been really important conversations about women’s roles and respect and treatment,” she said. “Covid has demonstrated that even though childcare is such an essential part of many families’ lives, it is a fragile sector and needs to be seen as a core piece of economic and social infrastructure. “What makes this such a great time for tackling this is the urgency that Covid has introduced. “This panel has an important opportunity to connect those urgent and shorter-term steps with longer-term and more sustainable opportunities for women.”",News/Australia news,NSW to revisit economic gender disparity in the wake of Grace Tame and Brittany Higgins,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/10/nsw-to-revisit-economic-gender-disparity-in-the-wake-of-grace-tame-and-brittany-higgins
2/10/2022,"Australian basketball star Joe Ingles has spoken of his devastation following news the Utah Jazz has traded him to the Portland Trailblazers as part of a three-team NBA deal. Ingles, who was a key part of the Boomers’ first Olympic medal in Tokyo last year, has become a cult hero for the Jazz since arriving in 2014 after being cut by the Los Angeles Clippers.  Last season the 34-year-old was in career-best form and finished runner-up in the NBA’s Sixth Man of the Year award, but sustained a season-ending ACL injury at the end of January. He has been dealt to Portland, while the Jazz will receive Blazers guard Nickeil Alexander-Walker and San Antonio Spurs forward Juancho Hernangomez. Today hurts… I knew it was a possibility but didn’t want to believe it, we have been lucky to call this place home for 8 years!I got a lot more to say, but I’m going to have a beer & relax with some good friends..Go get a win fellas! I’ll always be watching ❤️ Because of his injury, Ingles’s value to the Blazers comes from his expiring $US13m ($AUS18m) contract. Since Ingles is a free agent after the season, the Australian native could return to Utah in the off-season. Ingles confirmed the reports on Thursday via Twitter and indicated he would at some point elaborate on his situation. “Today hurts … I knew it was a possibility but didn’t want to believe it, we have been lucky to call this place home for 8 years,” he wrote. “I got a lot more to say, but I’m going to have a beer & relax with some good friends.. Go get a win fellas! I’ll always be watching.” Appreciate the love & support- from near and far. Today is so sad. I don’t have the words to put together just yet. Incredibly grateful for the last 8years here as part of the Jazz family &Utah community. Focus is Joe’s knee & rehab. Deeply saddened, & thankful for you all xxx Ingles had acknowledged a trade was possible last week after sustaining his injury. “If I’m able to get someone back that would help them make a push for the end of the year, I understand that,” he told medai. “I’m not going to sit here and be sour and upset.” Alexander-Walker was traded for the second time in two days after being dealt by the Pelicans in the deal that will bring C.J. McCollum to New Orleans. The 17th pick in the 2019 draft, Alexander-Walker is averaging 12.8 points per game this season. The Spurs will receive Tomas Satoransky, along with one of Utah’s second-round draft picks; while in addition to Ingles, the Blazers will get forward Elijah Hughes from the Jazz and another of their second-round picks.",Sport/Sport,‘Today hurts’: Injured Boomers veteran Joe Ingles traded by NBA club Utah Jazz,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/10/today-hurts-injured-boomers-veteran-joe-ingles-traded-by-utah-jazz
2/10/2022,"One in three people across America have detectable levels of a toxic herbicide linked to cancers, birth defects and hormonal imbalances, a major nationwide survey has found. Human exposure to the herbicide 2,4-D has substantially risen amid expanding use among farmers despite a multitude of health and environmental concerns, according to the first nationally representative study evaluating the footprint of the chemical.  The herbicide was developed in the mid-1940s and quickly became the go-to weedkiller for farmers focused on increasing crop yields, while also gaining popularity among gardeners looking for a pristine lawn. Its popularity dipped in favor of Roundup (glyphosate) and genetically modified cotton and soyabeans resistant to this herbicide, but it has seen a resurgence since the spread of Roundup-resistant weeds. 2,4-D is currently riding high thanks to this Whac-a-Mole approach to pest control in industrialised farming, with about 600 US agricultural and residential products now containing the chemical which can be ingested through the skin, mouth and nose. Researchers from George Washington university examined the urine samples of 14,395 people (aged six and older) from all walks of life who take part in the annual National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. They looked for biomarkers to the pesticide, and compared the exposure levels detected with the use of 2,4-D from 2001 until 2014. As the pesticide grew in popularity among farmers and gardeners, so did evidence of human exposure, rising from a low of 17% in 2001-02 to a high of almost 40% a decade later. Exposure to high levels of 2,4-D, an ingredient of Agent Orange used against civilians during the Vietnam war, has been linked to cancers including leukemia in children, birth defects and reproductive problems among other health issues. While little is known about the impact of low-level exposure to the herbicide, it does disrupt the endocrine system – a network of glands that make hormones which control growth and development, reproduction, metabolism and our organs and moods. The study, published online in Environmental Health, found exposure was not uniform, with several subgroups including children aged six to 11 and women of childbearing age showing substantially higher levels of 2,4-D in their urine. Exposure to toxins is often more detrimental during developmental or key growth periods like pregnancy and early childhood. “Further study must determine how rising exposure to 2,4-D affects human health–especially when exposure occurs early in life,” said Melissa Perry, professor of environmental and occupational health and senior author of the paper. “Children and other vulnerable groups are also increasingly exposed to other pesticides and these chemicals may act synergistically to produce health problems.” The study also found that Black participants, who multiple previous studies have shown to have higher exposure to all sorts of environmental pollutants, showed signs of lower exposure to the weedkiller than white Americans. This may be a result of historic racist policies restricting access to homes with gardens and green spaces for Black communities, the researchers argue. Overall, the amount of 2,4-D applied in agriculture increased 67% between 2012 and 2020, but its use will almost certainly grow sharply over the next decade due to the widespread use of the controversial weedkiller Enlist Duo – a relatively newly approved combo (2,4-D and glysophates) for genetically modified crops. This will make both toxins – which are both banned in some countries – increasingly difficult to avoid. “Our study suggests human exposures to 2,4-D have gone up significantly and they are predicted to rise even more in the future,” Marlaina Freisthler, a PhD student and co-author of the study. “Given the potential for human and environmental health impacts of such widespread exposures, we believe increases in use and exposures are not the direction to be going.”",News/Environment,"One in three Americans have detectable levels of toxic weedkiller, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/09/toxic-herbicide-exposure-study-2-4-d
