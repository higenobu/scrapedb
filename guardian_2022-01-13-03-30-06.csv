1/13/2022,"Permission to build a 52-storey skyscraper with a single fire escape for more than 400 flats is expected to be granted on Thursday, in a move safety campaigners described as “scary”. Plans for one of the UK’s tallest residential buildings close to Canary Wharf will go before the London Borough of Tower Hamlets planning committee on Thursday evening with a recommendation from officials for approval.  The Cuba Street tower is set to have 655 bedrooms with the highest close to 170 metres in the air – two-and-a-half times the height of Grenfell Tower. It features only a single staircase, which is currently allowed under building regulations if the strategy in a fire is to tell residents to stay put in their homes. All new apartment blocks above 11 metres must also be fitted with sprinklers. But fire safety experts warn it is inadequate because design features meant to keep people safe in their flats might fail, triggering an evacuation while firefighters are trying to use the same stair in the opposite direction. The tower is being developed by Ballymore, and residents of another of the company’s nearby apartment complexes, New Providence Wharf, have also raised concerns about the design. Smoke clogged corridors at NPW during a serious fire in May, which injured three people. The London fire brigade discovered ventilation systems, the firefighter lift and door holders didn’t perform as expected. “It’s very scary,” said Natalie Carter, a resident at New Providence Wharf and part of the Tower Hamlets Justice for Leaseholders group. “If they do need to evacuate for any reason you are talking about doing that on the same staircase the firefighters would be using, it just seems absolutely bonkers.” Arnold Tarling, a chartered surveyor and fire safety expert, added: “It is utter madness that this is still allowed.” He recently inspected a newly built apartment tower in the same area of London and discovered serious failings that would mean residents might not be safe to stay in their flats in a fire. He said the worst-case scenario of having a single staircase was “another Bronx fire, another Grenfell, another Lakanal type fire,” references to blazes in social housing blocks last week in New York, in west London in 2017 and in south London in 2009 that together killed 89 people. Fire safety experts contacted by the Guardian pointed out that second staircases reduce the area for saleable apartments and so limit profitability. The president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, Simon Allford, said public safety must be the fundamental concern of the government’s new building safety regulator. He called on it to set a new height threshold at which at least two staircases are required to provide for access for firefighters and residents’ evacuation. The international building code, which is adopted by many countries and US states but not the UK, requires that buildings over 128 metres have at least two staircases. The latest 2019 version of UK guidance states simply that “appropriate means of escape in case of fire from the building … [must be] capable of being safely and effectively used at all material times”. “In my opinion you have to build in resilience,” said Russ Timpson, secretary of the Tall Building Fire Safety Network. “You have to have a plan A and a plan B because if stay-put doesn’t work, a simultaneous evacuation is an almost impossible challenge with a single staircase. Around the world firefighters talk about having one escape stair and one attack stair.” Asked about the single staircase, a Ballymore spokesperson said the planning application “will only move forward with the support of the London fire brigade and building control”. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said it is “reviewing the building regulations guidance, including what provision of escape routes is needed to ensure residents are safe in the event of a fire”. A spokesperson said: “We’re bringing in the biggest improvements to building safety in 40 years – with tougher regulations that will give more rights and protections for residents and make homes safer.” Building safety campaigners are also arguing Ballymore should invest first in fixing fire safety problems in existing blocks as part of the wider building safety crisis. On Monday, Michael Gove, the secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities, announced the government would legislate to force developers to pay to fix unsafe apartment blocks. The Treasury told Gove he “must prioritise safety over supply”. Ballymore said it has “committed significant investment towards covering the cost of cladding remediation, with works having been under way across our developments for some time, and are working to ensure leaseholders bear no cost”.",News/Society,Planners set to approve 52-storey London tower with only one staircase,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/12/planners-set-to-approve-52-storey-london-tower-with-only-one-staircase
1/13/2022,"Novak Djokovic’s preparations for the Australian Open continued on Wednesday as the question of his presence in the country remained unresolved. Australia’s immigration minister, Alex Hawke, continues to deliberate over whether or not he should revoke Djokovic’s visa. On Wednesday afternoon, Djokovic returned for his third practice at Melbourne Park since he was released from immigration detention. With a small contingent of media present, Djokovic trained with the Australian youngster Tristan Schoolkate and he continued to ease himself back into practice, working through a series of drills.  Djokovic had previously ensured his practises were closed to onlookers, with the doors of Rod Laver Arena locked during his sessions and the live feed from the arena turned off. At the same time the world No 1 was practising, he published a statement on Instagram addressing the pictures of him attending an award presentation for children – “I was asymptomatic and felt good, and I had not received the notification of a positive PCR test result until after that event” – and an interview with French newspaper L’Equipe after he had tested positive for Covid-19. According to The Age newspaper in Melbourne, the Department of Home Affairs is investigating the various issues Djokovic addressed in his social media post – his incorrect Australia Travel Declaration, his reported failure to comply with Covid-19 rules in Serbia and questions about the date of his Covid test – in addition to Hawke’s investigation into his medical exemption. The reception from Djokovic’s colleagues continues to be mixed. João Sousa, a Portuguese veteran and longtime top 100 player, described Djokovic’s attitude as “a little selfish” towards his fellow players, a top 100 field that is now 97% vaccinated according to the ATP. “I can put myself in his shoes and understand what he’s going through,” he said. “I understand that it’s what he believes in, but it’s a little selfish towards his colleagues in the profession because many of us – not me – didn’t want to get vaccinated and we had to do it in order to play. It was the rules. It turns out to be a rule that Djokovic managed to get around.” At a time when politicians have been roundly critical of Djokovic, a sympathetic voice has come in the form of Matt Canavan, a National party senator, who stressed the necessity of de-escalating the situation. “I don’t want to live in a world of strict bureaucracy when if we make a mistake on a form we are hauled off to jail. If there’s been an error or a lie, he needs to be questioned again and see how or why that happened,” he said, according to Bola Amarela. Meanwhile, the Women’s Tennis Association has addressed the deportation of Renata Voracova, the Czech doubles specialist who was detained by Australian Border Force and deported after Djokovic’s run-in with the authorities. “Renata Voracova followed these rules and procedures, was cleared for entry upon her arrival, competed in an event and then suddenly had her visa cancelled when she had done nothing wrong,” said the WTA. Unlike Djokovic, Voracova has placed blame on Tennis Australia and in a recent interview with AFP she said she expects compensation from the governing body.",Sport/Sport,Novak Djokovic back on court as investigations continue,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/12/novak-djokovic-back-on-court-australia-open-investigations-continue
1/13/2022,"The eight-year jail sentence handed to Frankie Smith for causing or allowing the death of her toddler daughter, Star Hobson, has been referred to the court of appeal. Suella Braverman, the attorney general, said the case was “tragic and extremely upsetting” and she believed 20-year-old Smith’s sentence was “unduly lenient”.  Smith was jailed last month after being convicted of causing or allowing the death of her 16-month-old daughter, after a jury cleared her of murder and manslaughter charges. Her partner, Savannah Brockhill, 28, was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 25 years. Braverman said she had concluded that she could not refer Brockhill’s sentence. “I can only challenge a sentence if it is not just lenient but unduly so, such that the sentencing judge made a gross error or imposed a sentence outside the range of sentences reasonably available in the circumstances of the offence. The threshold is a high one, and the test was not met in this case,” she said in a statement. The toddler died of cardiac arrest after being punched or kicked by Brockhill in September 2020 using “massive force” on a par with “a road traffic accident”, according to the judge. A postmortem revealed previous brain injuries, fractured bones and internal organ injury. Halfway through the seven-week trial, Smith pleaded guilty to eight instances of child cruelty. The court heard Smith was of extremely low intelligence and “abnormally compliant” when told to do something by an authority figure. However, the judge said she “did not accept” these factors excused Smith’s conduct, describing her as a “neglectful and callous parent” who thought only of her own interests and would have realised her partner was abusing Star. A local review of Star’s death is due to be published in January after at least five safeguarding referrals were made to Bradford council. It will feed into a national one ordered by the government after the murder of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes. The jail sentences handed to Emma Tustin and Thomas Hughes, who killed six-year-old Labinjo-Hughes, were also referred to the court of appeal for being too lenient in December. Braverman said her thoughts “are with all those who loved Star Hobson”. “This vulnerable and innocent child was subjected to continued physical abuse, and her mother, Frankie Smith, allowed it to happen. “This case will have caused upset to anyone who read about it, but my job is to decide if a sentence appears to be too low based solely on the facts of the case. I have carefully considered the details of this case, and I concluded that I can refer Frankie Smith’s sentence to the court of appeal as I believe it is unduly lenient.”",News/UK news,Star Hobson killing: mother’s sentence referred to court of appeal,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/12/star-hobson-killing-mothers-sentence-referred-to-court-of-appeal
1/13/2022,"With MPs and the leader of the opposition calling for Boris Johnson to resign, discussion of who may take over has reached new levels. Here are some potential runners and riders should the prime minister resign or be forced out.  Despite being a former remainer, the 46-year-old foreign secretary is the darling of the Conservative grassroots, regularly topping the poll of party members carried out by website Conservative Home. Fans love her rhetoric, which is heavy on liberty, free trade and patriotism, and credit her with signing a slew of post-Brexit trade deals. She has a carefully honed public image, helped by lavish use of taxpayer-funded government photographers – including recently having herself pictured Margaret Thatcher-style, atop a tank. The chancellor, 41, was for some time regarded as the frontrunner to replace Johnson but his popularity has slipped of late among the Tory members who will make the final decision. Sunak is the son of Indian immigrants from east Africa – a doctor and a pharmacist – who sent him to Winchester, the prestigious private school. He worked in the City before entering politics and takes a markedly different economic approach to Johnson, favouring lower taxes and tougher public spending restraint. Sunak was criticised recently for being in California as businesses were crying out for help when the Omicron coronavirus wave sent restaurant and pub bookings plunging. The foreign secretary, 55, lost out to Johnson in the 2019 leadership contest by a clear margin but is still regarded as a potential contender if the job falls vacant again. Returned to the backbenches by Johnson, he has been scrupulously loyal, using his experience as a former health secretary to chair the health select committee. His South West Surrey constituency is among those being targeted by the Liberal Democrats, who believe traditional Tory “blue wall” voters are turned off by Johnson’s rule-breaking. By contrast, Hunt would be regarded as a safe pair of hands, though some colleagues fear he lacks political pizzazz. The home secretary is a controversial figures to many but her right-leaning views and very obviously tough line on immigration make her appealing to many among the Tory membership, as well as to like-minded MPs. An MP since 2010, Patel, 49, has held a series of ministerial posts but faced a two-year exile from the front bench after being forced to resign as international development secretary for having unofficial meetings with Israeli officials. Brought back as home secretary by Johnson, he expended political capital keeping her in the job even after an official report concluded she had bullied officials. Paradoxically, while she in an immigration hardliner, the fact Patel has overseen a period in which there has been much coverage of unofficial Channel crossings by refugees and migrants could count against her. The chancellor-turned-health secretary came a fairly distant fourth in the race to succeed Theresa May but is likely to fancy his chances of doing better this time. The 52-year-old former investment banker and MP for Bromsgrove since 2010 officially backed remain in the Brexit referendum but is not defined by that, and has a suitably robust Tory ideology which would appeal to many elements of the party, as well as a stirring backstory, growing up above the family shop in Bristol. Javid left Johnson’s cabinet in spectacular fashion in early 2020 after No 10 tried to impose a team of advisers on him but returned as health secretary in June 2021. His current role could count against him if there is a sense Javid has been influenced by the public health “blob” over Covid rules that are unpopular among many Tory MPs and party members. The business secretary, 46, certainly has the free marketeer credentials to appeal to key elements of the Tory party and was a contributor, like Truss, to the 2012 tome Britannia Unchained, a handbook for post-Thatcherite Conservatives. The first black British Conservative to run his own government department, Kwarteng became an MP in 2010 but did not thrive in the Cameron years, waiting until 2018 for his first junior ministerial post. The east London-born Eton scholar is known as intelligent but with an occasional tendency to speak without properly thinking such as when, late last year, he suggested the parliamentary standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, should step down over the case of Owen Paterson. While his current job as education secretary is Zahawi’s first department-leading cabinet role, his prominence and popularity shot up during his year-long stint as minister for vaccines, overseeing probably the most successful project of the Johnson era. MP for Stratford-upon-Avon since 2010, Zahawi, 54, has a backstory perhaps more compelling even than Javid’s. Born in Baghdad, he and his Kurdish family fled Saddam Hussein’s rule when he was nine and Zahawi went on to have a private education in London. The co-founder of polling firm YouGov, Zahawi has also worked extensively in the oil industry, and is one of Westminster’s richest MPs, owning a significant portfolio of properties.",News/Politics,"If Boris Johnson is forced out, who might replace him?",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/12/if-boris-johnson-is-forced-out-who-might-replace-him
1/13/2022,"Joe Root has thrown his support behind Chris Silverwood, insisting the embattled head coach should keep his job as England prepare for “one last push” to end their failed Ashes campaign with a win. After missing the drawn fourth Test in Sydney with Covid-19, Silverwood has rejoined the tour for Friday’s fifth instalment in Hobart but at 3-0 down finds his position under review for a winter that has already seen the goal of winning the T20 World Cup end with a semi-final defeat by New Zealand.  Tom Harrison, the ECB’s chief executive, and Ashley Giles, the managing director of England men’s cricket, are both on tour and must now decide whether these two disappointments are mitigated by the strains of the pandemic. Root, who will discuss his own future as captain after a series finale in which Sam Billings appears likely to make his Test debut, appears to think they are. Asked if he would like Silverwood to remain in place for the tour of the Caribbean in March, Root replied: “Yes I would. It was a difficult week for the group of players with him not being around and it must have been very difficult for him. “The performances we put in during the first three games, I feel we let him and the coaches down to a degree. We’ve not played anywhere near the level we’re capable of. It’s a chance to do that this week.” On Silverwood’s qualities, Root said: “I think he’s very calm, he has the respect of the guys and he’s got a desperation to see everyone do well or up-skill the players as best he can. I think he’s had a very difficult time of it with the environments we’ve been living in, trying to manage winning matches with bubble environments away from home, and multi-format players trying to prepare for an Ashes and a World Cup. It’s very difficult. “For a long time we’ve not been able to put our best teams out because we’ve been constantly trying to make sure from a mental wellbeing point of view everyone is looked after properly, because of the schedule we’ve dealt with over two years.” The endorsement notably differs from Root’s opposite number, Pat Cummins, who despite Australia’s T20 World Cup and Ashes wins recently insisted head coach Justin Langer’s expiring contract would not be discussed until the end of the series. Trevor Bayliss, the former England head coach, is favourite to succeed him. Root looked exhausted at the end of the Sydney Test but said he will strive for “one last push” in Tasmania. Before then comes a decision whether to enter next month’s Indian Premier League’s “mega-auction”, with paperwork due to be submitted by the end of the week. The 31-year-old has spurned previous editions of the competition but appears tempted. “Time is ticking but I have a lot to weigh up,” Root said. “Will it have a negative impact on me playing Test cricket? If I don’t think so then I will put myself in the auction. But I will never do anything that will detract from playing Test cricket for England. It is so important to make sure that is the priority for me and other players as well.”",Sport/Sport,Joe Root backs embattled England coach Chris Silverwood to keep job,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/12/joe-root-backs-england-coach-chris-silverwood-to-keep-job-ashes-cricket
1/13/2022,"Hobart’s role on previous Ashes tours was often to put a chill into English cricketers during their final tour game before being plunged into the tropical heat of the Gabba in Queensland like lobsters being dropped into a pot of boiling water. This time, however, after Perth ruled itself out through a hard Covid border, the Bellerive Oval hosts the Ashes denouement that begins on Friday. A boutique ground with views of the spectacular Derwent estuary, it has staged 13 Tests since its first in 1989 but none between Australia and England. Tim Paine, the local favourite who lost the Test captaincy before the series, will be heartbroken to miss this slice of history.  An extra twist, and one that may well see a few more cable-knits worn, is that the match is also a second day-night affair of the series in order to maintain the same primetime broadcast hours in the eastern states as had Western Australia not held firm on its seclusion. And if a reminder is needed, Australia’s record in pink-ball home Tests after their victory in Adelaide now reads played nine, won nine. Whether an upset can follow England’s rearguard draw in Sydney or not, the 3-0 scoreline means their tour will struggle to look polished or rolled in glitter come the end. Chris Silverwood, the head coach, is back on site after recovering from Covid-19 and received loyal support from Joe Root on Wednesday but it remains to be seen how far this goes. The status quo held after a 4-0 defeat four years ago but Root’s captaincy was in its infancy and Trevor Bayliss, Silverwood’s predecessor, was locked into the World Cup project. Even factoring in the pandemic, change feels far likelier this time. Either way, England must harness plenty of what they did well last week even if they slightly hobble into the fifth Test with niggles, collective fatigue and one confirmed absence in the shape of Jos Buttler. His tour was ended with a broken left index finger and a bad one too, with the stomachs of teammates said to have turned when he had a pain-killing injection directly into the busted digit before bravely walking out to bat. In comes Sam Billings behind the stumps for a surprise Test debut by dint of his being in the country playing Twenty20 cricket and cap No 700. The 30-year-old brings infectious energy and an orthodox batting technique but it is worth noting he has kept in just one first-class match for Kent in the past three years, the sum total of 95.3 overs across two innings versus Leicestershire at the end of the summer. There is an expectation that, having stumped up a reported A$5m to host, Tasmania isn’t in the market for such a quick game either and so a pitch that was still green two days out is still tipped to start flat. As such, Billings may well see his endurance and concentration significantly tested, as well as the glovework that has been the subject of assiduous drills from James Foster, the designated coach on tour. Australia Usman Khawaja, David Warner, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Cameron Green, Alex Carey (wk), Pat Cummins (c), Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Scott Boland England Rory Burns, Zak Crawley, Dawid Malan, Joe Root (c), Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow, Sam Billings (wk), Chris Woakes, Ollie Robinson, Mark Wood, Stuart Broad Haseeb Hameed appeared to be struggling with a rib issue at training on Wednesday but, more acutely, his run of six successive single figure scores means he needs withdrawing from the frontline regardless. Rory Burns now has the chance to prove he was dropped too soon and, surprisingly given the musical chairs of the past few years, this looks to be the first time he has opened alongside Zak Crawley in Test cricket. Further injury clouds hung over Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow but their respective side and thumb problems were overcome so impressively in Sydney as to suggest they will likely go again. Root was still preaching caution here, however, stressing the need for players to be “fit to perform” not simply fit to take the field. Stokes will definitely be unable to bowl, however, which, going by selections during the summer, may mean Jack Leach has to make way for an extra seamer. To do so after producing his best performance on tour – four wickets and a defiant 77-minute vigil with the bat – would rather sum up the left-arm spinner’s fortunes. In terms of the seam attack, Mark Wood appears likely to play a third successive Test match, raising yet more eyebrows as to why he was rested in Adelaide after just 25.1 overs in Brisbane when the series was live. But two pairs of fresh legs may still come in and, if so, this means one of Jimmy Anderson or Stuart Broad has played their final Test match in Australia, even if both say they want to plough on to the Caribbean. Chris Woakes and Ollie Robinson are the two likeliest to be considered and in the case of the latter it comes after a breather that might not have been required so early were he simply in better physical shape. Given Mitchell Starc bowls 10mph quicker and is about to play his fifth Test in a row, Root said he hopes Robinson – and English county seamers more generally – learn “serious lessons” about what is required at this level. Australia’s headaches are, once again, good ones after Usman Khawaja surely secured his spot with those magical twin centuries at the SCG. If Travis Head returns at No 5 after his recent bout of Covid, Khawaja may replace Marcus Harris at opener.

1/13/2022,"Finally we got some kind of explanation from the prime minister for his boozy parties at Downing Street. It turns out that Boris Johnson wants us to believe that Boris Johnson thinks that Boris Johnson is catatonically stupid. And that the British public are equally half-witted enough to believe any old lies he happens to come up with. There’s just one problem with this. Boris may be dim, but he’s not that dim. And the rest of us have long since learned to see through his mendacity. This was the prime minister’s questions at which Johnson finally ran out of road. An outright denial that he had been at the party on 20 May 2020 would no longer keep him out of trouble as there was anecdotal evidence he was there. So all that was left to him was to come up with the best possible excuse and hope it would buy off a few of the more gullible Tory MPs. Only the best possible excuse turned out to be a crock of total shit.  Here’s how it was, said Johnson, as he made a short statement to the Commons. He recognised the sacrifices the country had made and he wanted to apologise for having got pissed with No 10 staff in his own back garden. The thing was that he had just not realised the party was a party. When the email was sent – which he definitely had not read – inviting everyone to enjoy the sunshine and to bring your own booze, the last thing he had imagined was that a party was about to take place. Even though 60 staffers had made that assumption, realised it was against the law and decided to stay away. So anyway, he and his then fiancee – Carrie always came along to work meetings – coincidentally turned up at the party that wasn’t a party, even though they hadn’t seen the invite, and stayed for 25 minutes just because it seemed rude not to. He discussed a few work matters before going back to his flat and remembered thinking how brilliant it was that so many people were staying late to work outdoors over a few bevvies. And he hadn’t even thought the party was a party when he saw the staff clearing up the empties from the flower bed the following morning. Indeed it was only when Dominic Cummings had mentioned last week that the party might have actually have been a party that it occurred to him the party could have been a party after all. He now bitterly regretted everything – most of all, getting caught – and all he was asking was that people gave him a bit of wriggle room before Sue Gray submitted the findings to her investigation. Hopefully she would be as gullible as he imagined everyone else to be. None of which cut any ice with Keir Starmer. This PMQs may have seemed like the most open of goals for the Labour leader but he still needed to stick the ball in the net in front of a packed Commons’ chamber. Which he did six times. Johnson was pathetic: after months of denial, was this the best he could come up with? A dog ate my homework excuse would be less insulting. The prime minister had attended the party. He had broken lockdown rules. He had misled parliament when he had said how sickened he was about other No 10 parties. The country thought he was a pathological liar. He needed to resign. Boris visibly crumpled. Unlike Prince Andrew, he knew what is was like to sweat. Back in No 10 he had managed to convince himself that his feeble explanation might be enough to get him off the hook. After all, he had a long history of getting out of tight situations by lying through his teeth. But now he could feel his optimism seeping away. He was fooling no one. Not even himself. He tugged at his toddler haircut in desperation. His eyes folded in on themselves to bloodshot pinpricks. The king of bullshitters was all out of ideas. Even he could see how abject his lies were. He willed himself not to exist. To be elsewhere. Somewhere he wouldn’t be exposed to the starkness of his own self-hatred. His voice became strangely disconnected. Like an automaton. Without effect. He could only express his regret at the way events had panned out. A narcissist can’t do empathy and can only feel sorry for himself. And this was ultimately his tragedy. His fall from grace. He had never felt so exposed. Just wait for Sue Gray. Hope that she dematerialises. Rishi Sunak had made himself scarce in Devon. “I’m right behind you, prime minister. 200 miles behind you.” The rest of the cabinet stared impassively at the floor, their expressions hidden behind their masks. They too would rather have been anywhere but the Commons. This was also their humiliation. They were the ones who had put a man transparently unfit to be prime minister into No 10. They knew what Boris was like but hadn’t cared. His incompetence and corruption was also theirs. The Tory backbenchers were also out of sorts. No one could bring themselves to actually defend their leader; but neither did they dare attack him. His immorality cast a toxic pall over proceedings. Boris was the turd that would not flush and which no one dared mention. So instead they asked him about irrelevant details of constituency business. A county motto. It was all somewhat surreal. It was left to Labour’s Chris Bryant to get the last word. How stupid did he think we all were? Did he really imagine even a 10-year-old thinking he would get away with lines like that? And would it yet again be people, like Allegra Stratton, who had worked for Boris that would end up losing their jobs? Johnson shrugged, still a semi-absentee observer of his own downfall. Needs must. If that’s what it took for him to survive. It was a fight to the death. Whose exactly would soon become clear.

1/13/2022,"A Benin bronze in the collection of a Newcastle museum is to be proactively returned to Nigeria, the latest in a number of repatriations that ratchet up pressure on the British Museum to follow suit. Bosses of the Great North Museum: Hancock announced that it had recently been established that a brass stave with a distinctive bird finial had been looted from Benin City by the British military in 1897.  It was taken during the ugly “punitive expedition”, in which a palace and much of the ancient city was destroyed. The bronzes, around 4,500 plaques, statues and other objects actually made from a brass alloy, were later auctioned off to defray the expedition costs. They are in museum collections across the world and momentum has been growing for institutions to voluntarily repatriate them. On Wednesday it was announced the Newcastle museum would do that, following the example of other institutions, including Jesus College, Cambridge and the University of Aberdeen by sending back the bronze. Vee Pollock, dean of culture and the creative arts at Newcastle university, which has stewardship of the collections, said they had “no hesitation” in making the decision. “There is no real question for us that the right thing to do was to offer its return.” The distinctive object, currently on display at the museum, was acquired in 1951 after the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum dispersed non-medical objects from its collection. The original accession cards for the objects were recently digitised, said Pollock. “We were able to trace the provenance, which categorically let us know that it was part of the punitive expedition.” Pollock said the decision was a significant one but a continuation of work it had been doing since the early 2000s, when the museum returned human remains to New Zealand and Australia. In this instance the evidence said categorically that the object was taken illegally “and in circumstances that I doubt any would condone”. Keith Merrin, the director of Tyne & Wear Archives & Museums, said returning the stave was the right thing to do. “Repatriation can be a powerful cultural, spiritual and symbolic act which, recognises the wrongs of the past and restores some sense of justice,” he said. The return is part of the museum’s wider repatriation and decolonisation policy. The kingdom of Benin, in what is now southern Nigeria and not to be confused with the modern-day country of Benin, was one of the most important and powerful pre-colonial states of west Africa. Germany has said it will this year hand back to Nigeria Benin bronzes in its public collections. The Smithsonian in Washington has also committed to repatriation. All of which adds pressure on the British Museum, home to the most famous collection of Benin bronzes, around 900, in London. It has not agreed to return the bronzes but is a member of the Benin Dialogue Group. A central objective of the group is to establish a new museum in Benin City to allow “the most comprehensive display in the world of Benin bronzes”. The Ghanaian-British architect Sir David Adjaye has designed it. A spokesperson for the British Museum said: “We believe the strength and public value of the British Museum collection resides in its breadth and depth, allowing millions of visitors every year an understanding of the cultures of the world and how they interconnect over time – whether through trade, migration, conquest, or peaceful exchange. “The museum understands and recognises the significance of the issues surrounding the return of objects and works with communities, colleagues and museums across the globe to share the collection as widely as possible.”",Arts/Culture,Newcastle museum to return Benin bronze stave,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/12/newcastle-museum-to-return-benin-bronze-stave

About two weeks ago, Proud and her colleagues began treating dogs that had been walked on beaches including Scarborough, Robin Hood’s Bay, Whitby and Marske-by-the-sea. She issued an alert on Facebook on Monday, which has attracted more than 1,000 responses, with several dog owners sharing similar stories from inland areas and further down the coast in east Yorkshire. The post “blew up”, leading Proud to fear that “thousands” could have been affected by the mystery illness. Many responses were from those who had visited the coast in early January and had now returned home. “Their dogs are then carrying that virus or that bacteria or that problem. And so it’s no longer being kept on the coast as far as I can see, and it is spreading.” Although theories abound on social media, Proud said no vet, agency or authority had been able to establish a cause or a common theme in behaviour, such as eating or chewing anything washed up on the beach, or swimming in the sea. Whatever the cause, according to Proud, “if there’s going to be something spread, dogs will spread it”. She added: “If it’s a virus or a bacteria, it’s going to be spread in their urine or faeces or in the shedding of their fur. And we all know how dogs like to meet and greet each other – nose to nose, touching bums and all sorts. “My advice would be, if you’ve been on the beach, wash your dog in case it’s carrying anything and be vigilant about your dog’s behaviour.” Aaron Yeates and his French bulldog, Ada, from Carlisle, were on holiday in Robin Hood’s Bay over new year. The day after they returned on the 4 January, Ada had severe sickness and diarrhoea. After two trips to the vet, she is only just starting to keep food down again. “She’s lost a considerable amount of weight, her harness barely fits.” Kirsty Salisbury, coastal general manager for East Riding council, said the inspections team had not noticed anything unusual on the beaches. “We have been liaising with external partners during the course of yesterday to try to establish a cause, whilse also liaising with local colleagues, and also nationally. “From reports from local veterinary surgeries, the illness they are seeing within dogs and the tests carried out have not provided any direct links with the use of beaches.” Scarborough borough council also said that while dogs walked on beaches have been affected, other dog owners are reporting the same symptoms from inland locations. “If any vets have information about possible links to a canine virus that could help these investigations, we kindly ask them to contact our dog warden service.” The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), said it was aware of the incidents and was in contact with the Animal and Plant Health Agency.“We are not aware of any link with the issue of crustaceans washed ashore in the area late last year,” Defra said.",News/UK news,Warning as hundreds of dogs fall sick after beach walks on Yorkshire coast,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/12/warning-as-hundreds-of-dogs-fall-sick-after-beach-walks-on-yorkshire-coast
1/13/2022,"Quebec’s announcement that it will impose a healthcare tax on unvaccinated residents has prompted a fierce debate, as the province looks to salvage its crumbing healthcare system amid the latest wave of the coronavirus. The Canadian province’s premier, François Legault, said on Tuesday that those who had chosen to remain unvaccinated would pay a “health contribution”, acknowledging growing friction in the province as the unvaccinated draw on a greater share of the scarce medical resources.  The Quebec news site La Presse warned the tax could target vulnerable members of society who often lack the resources or information needed to access vaccines. Minorities, including Black and Indigenous residents, also have a long history of discrimination in the province’s healthcare system. “They must not become the scapegoats of the collective fed up,” the paper wrote. But La Presse concluded the tax was necessary tool in the fight against the virus. “In this exceptional context, asking non-vaccinated people to pay a reasonable price can be explained. It’s a question of fairness. Everyone must contribute to the war effort.” The province has not released a timeline for when it could impose the tax – the first of its kind in North America – or how much it might charge. Austria, which rolled out a similar tax in November, requires residents over 14 years of age pay €3,600 (US$4,100) every three months they remain unvaccinated. Canada’s vocal anti-vaccine movement has made headlines in recent months for protests outside hospitals, and has prompted frustration across the country. But experts warned against reactionary policies that undermined access to healthcare. “Even anti-social, obnoxious, misinformed and ignorant people have rights,” wrote the Globe and Mail health columnist André Picard. “In a public-health regime, patients must be treated based on medical needs. Period. There is no room for moralistic judgment or financial penalties. You don’t abandon your principles because somebody’s actions (or inaction) irks you.” The announcement appears to already have had some impact: Quebec’s health minister, Christian Dubé, announced on Wednesday that first-dose appointments had surged over the previous 48 hours. But the Canadian Civil Liberties Association questioned whether the policy could stand constitutional challenges. “Allowing the government to levy fines on those who do not agree with the government’s recommended medical treatment is a deeply troubling proposition,” Cara Zwibel, the acting general counsel for the CCLA, said in an emailed statement. “We have universal public healthcare in Canada … Some essential services – like basic healthcare for those who are ill – transcend such individual choices.” A recent poll found that Quebecers were consistently more willing to implement strong mandates for vaccines than other regions of the country. The province also has some of the strongest lockdown measures, including an evening curfew. The decision to financially punish residents marks a sharp departure from other provinces, which in the past looked to reward the vaccine-hesitant. Last summer, more than 150,000 Albertans signed up for a program that gave those with a first dose a C$100 (US$80) gift card – a program that likely cost the provinces more than C$10m. Premier Jason Kenney said on Tuesday his government had no plans to implement a tax. As the debate over the tax plays out, health minister Dubé warned the coming week will be the most difficult for the province, with hundreds more people expected to require hospitalization, further pushing Quebec’s healthcare system to the breaking point. “We’re very close to a point of no return,” he said.",News/World news,Quebec health tax for unvaccinated residents prompts fierce Covid debate,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/12/quebec-health-tax-unvaccinated-residents-canada
1/13/2022,"Well, he’s surely sweating now. One by one, the options are running out for Prince Andrew. He has just lost his latest legal battle after Manhattan federal court judge Lewis Kaplan’s ruling today that the sexual abuse lawsuit against him should proceed to trial, despite his lawyers advancing a variety of technical arguments, including that Virginia Giuffre no longer lives in the US, that she agreed in a 2009 deal not to pursue claims against certain other people, and that the court summons had not been properly served. He now faces a long trial that is likely to cause considerable reputational damage to the royal family in a year when everyone was supposed to be celebrating the Queen’s platinum jubilee. One possibility left to him is settling with Giuffre out of court. After all, this is what happens in the vast majority of civil litigations in the US, particularly after the attrition of a drawn-out court case begins to bite. But such an option could hit the cash-strapped prince hard in the pocket, given reports that he is trying to sell his £17m Swiss chalet to raise funds just to pay for his legal bills; this is after reports from the palace that the Queen would not bail him out financially. Since Giuffre had already received $500,000 in a legal settlement with Epstein, any settlement could run into the millions of dollars (some reports have put it as high as $5m). If that happened, despite palace denials, the Queen would probably have to intercede with help, just as she did when Charles was faced with a multimillion-pound divorce bill from Diana in 1995.  Whichever way you look at it, Andrew is now a major liability for the royal family and the palace must wish he would just retire to his Royal Lodge home and lead a life of quiet anonymity. Part of the problem, as we discovered with the sudden departure of Prince Harry from the royal hearth, is that there is no clear process of “de-royalling” a royal. Despite his escape to California, Harry was allowed to keep a few of his royal connections in case he ever had a change of heart. The situation of his Uncle Andrew is obviously much more serious and more difficult to decouple. Today’s ruling represents a victory for Giuffre’s team and, from her point of view, a positive step. But even in the best-case scenario for Andrew, if the legal process went to a full trial and he successfully defended himself, the reputational damage to him and the royal family would still be done. The fact that he had numbered among his friends two people who were convicted sex criminals would tarnish his name for ever. There is no way back for Andrew. Whatever the difficulties, the palace may have to find some way to “de-royal” him – he is for all intents and purposes an ex-royal and faces a lot of sweating in the year to come.
