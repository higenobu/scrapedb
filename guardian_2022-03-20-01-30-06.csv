3/20/2022,"Bad news used to arrive in a brown envelope. Now emails and PDFs keep Devon Scott up at night as soaring energy costs and other utilities force the single father of two from Birmingham to cut back. “Everything is going up. The gas bill, phone bill, internet. You think, ‘Wow. I’m not getting enough money to keep paying for these’, so you limit yourself on the other things you’re spending on,” says the 43-year-old. A former security officer who has worked nightclub doors and building foyers across the West Midlands, Scott, who is unemployed, says it is difficult to look for work with two young boys to look after. He has just £60 left after paying for bills each month out of his universal credit benefits. He expects more bad news from his energy supplier this April in Britain’s worsening cost of living emergency. However, Scott won’t see his benefit payments increase by anywhere near as much under government plans. “It’s a kick in the teeth,” says Scott, who also has to pay £60 a month in bedroom tax for his council home in the suburb of Stirchley. “We’re not asking for handouts. There are people out there trying to get their life in order and trying to get off benefits to get a decent job. But these things make it harder.” Pressure is rising on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to use his set piece spring statement on Wednesday to announce a fresh package of emergency support to help Scott and millions of others struggling to make ends meet amid the worst squeeze on living standards for decades. UK household incomes are set for the biggest annual fall since at least the mid-1970s this year, with energy bills due to rise by 54% from the start of next month. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has pushed gas prices to record levels – leading to warnings of a further jump in October. Against a backdrop of soaring wholesale energy costs, average gas and electricity bills will rise by about £700 to almost £2,000 a year from April, and experts say the fallout from Vladimir Putin’s war could push average bills to £3,000 a year from October. Before the Russian invasion, Sunak announced a £9bn package of support to deal with the crisis, offering a £150 council tax discount in April and £200 repayable loan from October. Vulnerable households eligible for the warm homes discount on their bills can get a further £150. However, campaigners say urgent further steps are required to prevent a dramatic rise in poverty this year – saying the single most effective step the chancellor could take at the spring statement would be a bigger increase in the value of universal credit benefits. Such a move would help Scott and many others in Birmingham, which has the highest benefit claimant count rate of major cities in the UK. Official figures show more than one in 10 working-age adults receive support from the state in some areas of the city, which is one of the places likely to be hardest hit by the cost of living crisis. Liam Byrne, the former Labour cabinet minister and West Midlands mayoral candidate, represents the constituency of Hodge Hill. This area of east Birmingham has the highest share of benefit claimants in the UK, leaving its citizens most exposed. “What residents talk about is basically being able to keep the fire on in one room of the flat for a few hours a day and that’s it,” he says. “If you’re a single mum with a young kid, you’re going to make sure the kid has got enough to eat. But the consequences of that is the kid is going to grow up cold.” Under current plans the government will raise the value of pensions and working-age benefits by 3.1% from April, the rate of inflation recorded in September. However, the Bank of England expects inflation could reach more than double that rate – with forecasts for the annual rate of rising living costs to hit a 30-year high of 8%. For the 9m households across the UK on means-tested benefits due to low incomes – both in and out of work – the plan means an average real-terms cut of £500 a year, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. As many as 400,000 people could be pulled into poverty as a result. “It’s so divorced from what’s going on in the lives of poor families today. It’s just enraging,” says Byrne. “It is immoral to raise universal credit by anything less than the cost of living. If you’re not doing that, you’re basically saying families are to get poorer because inflation is getting higher.” After a decade of cuts the UK’s main benefit scheme is already at its lowest value for 30 years, while Sunak had already pushed through a £20 a week cut to the value of universal credit in October – removing a temporary uplift given in response to Covid-19 – despite warnings of a brewing cost of living emergency. “We’re going to see more children going hungry as parents struggle to make ends meet,” says Imran Hussain, director of policy and campaigns at Action for Children, which along with a group of leading charities is lobbying the chancellor to raise the value of universal credit by at least the rate of inflation. “Many families are locked in a cost-of-living crisis with soaring energy, fuel and food bills, which is likely to get worse as the Ukraine conflict looks set to push up the costs of living even more.” For Collette Brown, a mother of two from Morecambe, the surge in energy bills couldn’t come at a worse time. Reliant on universal credit due to ill-health, she has stopped turning on the central heating in her private-rented home to keep costs down. “Before all this crisis hit we’d spent a fair few years getting out of energy debt,” she says, adding that she and her partner Aaron managed to get off a prepayment gas meter and on to direct debit utility bills last year. “We were getting on top of debts and bills, and now this has just come and slam-dunked everything.” The family has turned to food banks and pantries to get by, while choosing which rooms to keep warm with electric heaters. Brown is one of thousands of parents to have reached out to Citizens Advice for help in recent months. The charity’s frontline staff have helped nearly 16,000 people with energy debt in the first two months of the year alone, a rise of 33% compared with last year. Clare Moriarty, the charity’s chief executive, said the number of families in distress would only rise in April when energy bills went up again. “The government must do more. We’d urge them to immediately increase benefits in line with inflation to help people keep pace with costs,” she said. Christians Against Poverty – the charity supporting Devon Scott with debt help in Birmingham – is pleading with the government to use everything at its disposal to help the poorest in society through the coming months. The organisation had a 47% rise in calls to its helpline in January, and wants universal credit raised by significantly more than planned. The government said several measures had been taken to help people including reforms to universal credit, raising the minimum wage, freezing motoring fuel duties and its £9bn energy support package. “We recognise the pressures people are facing with the cost of living,” it said, “which is why we’re providing support worth £21bn this financial year and next to help.” Brown said the government needed to do more, saying the money being spent wasn’t helping those most at need. “How come they find money for wine and cheese parties, and second homes, or MPs wages to go up? They can always find money for that but not for working people’s wages, getting children out of child poverty, and to increase universal credit.” “People are going to be stuck in one big hamster wheel. We’ve got child poverty in this country: how does this country have that? The cost of living is just too frigging high. When is this bubble going to burst?”",News/Society,"The benefit claimant’s plight: ‘Everything is going up.

3/20/2022,"Rishi Sunak is under pressure from Tories and the opposition to make this week’s spring statement into an interventionist mini-budget to tackle the cost of living and impact of the Ukraine war. Here are the key issues: Labour and Tory backbenchers are pressing for April’s planned rise in national insurance to be delayed or scrapped. Announced by Sunak and Boris Johnson last autumn to raise funds for the NHS and social care, it is expected to bring in £12bn. The pair used a joint letter to a Sunday newspaper to commit to the policy. This could make reopening the issue politically difficult. Calls to scrap it have multiplied given the UK’s worsening cost-of-living crisis and a stronger than expected performance for the economy and government finances in recent months. Benefits usually increase in April by the previous September’s rate of inflation, which was 3.1%. Experts say that while the system works when inflation is stable, the recent growth in living costs calls for a bigger rise. The Bank of England says inflation could hit 8% this April. Raising benefits by more than planned could constitute an embarrassing U-turn for the chancellor, who staked his reputation on a £20 a week cut in universal credit last October – despite warnings of mounting pressure on households. Surging oil prices since the Russian invasion of Ukraine have sent the price of petrol to record highs. Tory backbenchers are pushing for a tax cut. Fuel duty is 57.95p a litre, plus 20% VAT. The Conservatives have frozen fuel duty for 12 years but campaigners say this clashes with net-zero ambitions. Concerns over energy security have fuelled calls for more domestic production. Some Conservatives want fresh investment in shale gas, or net zero rules relaxed for North Sea oil or coal-fired power. Labour want a windfall tax on energy producers, which have benefited from high prices, with the proceeds earmarked for supporting vulnerable families. Senior Tories, including former cabinet minister Jeremy Hunt, have urged Sunak to increase defence spending after the Ukraine invasion. Germany is setting up a €100bn fund to strengthen its armed forces. The UK spent 2.3% on defence in 2021, Germany 1.5% and the US 3.5%. Bosses are pressing Sunak for tax and spending plans to encourage business investment. The UK is lagging on this: it plunged after the Brexit vote and again in the pandemic. Despite Sunak’s “super deduction” tax break, investment is expected to fall again in 2022. The CBI has called for a permanent tax deduction on investment to encourage companies to spend, which could offset plans for corporation tax to rise from 19% to 25% from April 2023. Economists suggest higher rates of business investment could help boost the UK’s economic productivity after stalling progress in recent years – helping to raise the rate of economic growth and living standards.",News/Society,Six measures Rishi Sunak could take to combat UK’s cost-of-living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/19/six-measures-rishi-sunak-could-take-to-combat-uks-cost-of-living-crisis
3/20/2022,"With his 2019 debut, Between the Country, 29-year-old Noe caused quite a stir in Americana circles. Its songs delivered an unvarnished portrait of small-town Kentucky life, with a cast of meth-heads, bank robbers and dead-end losers, all delivered in a grainy voice reminiscent of the late John Prine. This follow-on proves a worthy successor. Again the subject is blue-collar Appalachia – Kentucky is one of the poorest states in the US – though this time round Noe’s outlook is more genial, his characters more amiable, be they broken-down Vietnam veterans, crazed truck drivers or heartbroken loners. His musical palette has broadened accordingly, helped by producer Andrija Tokic, whose analogue approach brings warmth to the sound. There are a couple of swaggering, electric rock-outs like opener Pine Grove, but most songs roll past (at around two minutes) driven by strummed acoustic guitars, with interpolations from fiddle and keyboard. There’s even a closing track, Road May Flood, soaked in tasteful strings. Noe still wears his principal influence, Prine, on his sleeve, but Ballad of a Retired Man could as easily come from Nebraska-era Springsteen, and PoW Blues from John Fogerty.

3/20/2022,"It’s a joke among my friends how not great a cook I am. [Former Radio 1 DJ] Nick Grimshaw is always slagging me off for the fact that he’ll come to my house and get served a bowl of crisps for dinner. Famously, I had to ring him up once to ask how to bake a potato. On my DJ rider, I used to ask for “pig paraphernalia”. I just think they are really clever, clean and amazing animals who are continuously disrespected by the world. I was expecting maybe a postcard or a mug or a soft toy, but it didn’t work out that way. There were people who took this very far: at one point, there were two live piglets in my dressing room. It was incredibly cute, but bad for the pigs, because it was loud, the music was reverberating [around] the walls. Another time, one of the promoters dressed up in a giant pig costume and hid in the toilet in my dressing room. So when I went to go to the toilet, there was just an enormous pig waiting for me. That was a bit freaky. I took them off the rider after that. Yes, I am aware there is a food truck in London called Annie Mae’s, which has a signature dish called the Annie Mac. I’ve had countless people send me photos of the sign and I’ve actually been to a couple of festivals where they’ve been, so I’ve gone to see them and had my photo taken in front of the sign. But macaroni cheese is my favourite dish, so I feel very honoured to be up there with Kanye West and other people they have named their macaroni cheeses after. When I was six, and my big sister was nine, she declared that she was going to be a vegetarian. My mum, who had four kids in five years, was not going to cook two separate meals for everyone, so we all became vegetarian. Then, when I left home and went to college, I went the absolute opposite direction, and was like, “Show me the burgers!” That kind of teenage rebellion. Now I’m mainly vegetarian and plant-based, but with a tiny bit of fish now and again. While I was doing my Radio 1 show, I started doing this intermittent fasting – [musician] Jessie Ware told me about it. You basically eat between eight hours a day: so I eat between 10am and 6pm, or 11am and 7pm usually, and you eat whatever you want in that time. I find it really, really suits me: I have a lot more energy, and I sleep better. And I’m just not snacking all the time, which is what I used to do. I need density in my food: I love a carb, I love a potato, I love bread and pasta. Because I come from a large family, it really matters how much food is on my plate. So if I go into a sandwich shop, I will literally pick up the sandwich and weigh it in my hand to make sure it feels heavy enough. That there’s enough heft to warrant me spending my money on it. My husband [DJ/musician Toddla T] can’t cook at all. I look like Heston Blumenthal compared to him. Our kids are just really grateful to have anything on the table. Anything that’s cooked at home, they’re like, “Wow, we’ll take it!” In lockdown, I took it upon myself to learn how to cook a few desserts. I started getting really into Nigella Lawson. And again, I got a lot of slagging from my friends because I was like, “Hey, this Nigella’s pretty good!” And they were like, “No shit, Annie, great discovery”. FoodBread. All types of bread.

3/20/2022,"For seasoned users of the internet, the chronology of our era divides into two ages: BG and AG – before and after Google. The year 1998 marks the dividing line. Before then, as the web expanded exponentially, a host of “search engines” had attempted to provide searchable indexes to it. The best of them was AltaVista, which launched in 1995 and provided the first searchable, full-text database of the web via a simple interface. It was the engine that I and most of my colleagues used until one fateful day in 1998 when an even starker webpage appeared with a simple text box and almost nothing else except the name Google. And from the moment you first used it, there was no going back. Why? Because Google used an original way of ranking the relevance of the results turned up by a query. It effectively conducted an automated peer review of websites. The more webpages linked to a particular site, the more relevant it was likely to be and so it was given a higher ranking. The algorithm, dubbed PageRank, which did this was the foundation on which Google’s domination of the internet search was built. The reason Google swept all before it was that its ranking system seemed objective: it just counted links and ranked accordingly. It could be gamed, of course, and a mini-industry of search engine optimisers evolved to try and ensure that a Google search would highly rank their clients’ pages. But Google users could at least be confident that the company itself wasn’t favouring some results over others. No advertising was involved. The company’s founders were adamant that favouring advertisers’ pages would undermine the integrity of their results. “We expect,” they wrote in 1998, “that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers… we believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm.” Quite so. But then, after burning investors’ money for two years, the founders discovered in 2000 that high-minded objectivity doesn’t pay the rent and so they morphed into surveillance capitalists, monitoring their users to glean information about them that would be of interest to advertisers. Between then and the company’s initial public offering in 2004, Google’s revenues increased by nearly 4,000%. For a long time, the intrusion of advertising considerations didn’t seem to bother users much, though it understandably riled industry competitors and regulators, especially in the EU (to which Google has paid billions of euros in fines). Despite this, its position as the dominant search engine across large parts of the globe has remained stable since, well, for ever. That suggests that the company must be doing something right, if only because, unlike, say, with Facebook, genuine alternative search engines are readily available. All of which makes the online fuss generated by a blogpost by Dmitri Brereton, a software engineer at a San Francisco company, intriguing. Under the heading Google Search Is Dying, Brereton wrote: “If you’ve tried to search for a recipe or product review recently, I don’t need to tell you that Google search results have gone to shit. You would have already noticed that the first few non-ad results are SEO [search engine optimisation] optimised sites filled with affiliate links and ads.” He admits that Google still gives decent results for many other categories, “especially when it comes to factual information. You might think that Google results are pretty good for you, and you have no idea what I’m talking about. What you don’t realise is that you’ve been self-censoring yourself from searching most of the things you would have wanted to search. You already know subconsciously that Google isn’t going to return a good result.” This struck me as a bit patronising, even though it sparked a chorus of approval on Reddit and Hacker News and even a piece in the New Yorker. The general tenor of the discussion was that only clueless idiots would do a simple Google search rather than the complex formulae available to those who know what they’re doing. Since I don’t have a dog in this fight (I use Google very little and DuckDuckGo most of the time), my hunch is that this is the online equivalent of a storm in a teacup. On the occasions when I use Google, it’s generally for factual stuff and so my experience may be different from that of the Reddit and Hacker News crowd. It may be, as the New Yorker suggests, that the results coming from Google are a reflection of how good the SEO-optimising crowd are at gaming PageRank. The chief executive of DuckDuckGo (who of course does have a dog in the fight) offers three other possible reasons for dissatisfaction with Google. One is users’ aversion to being tracked. Another is annoyance at the way Google prioritises its own products in purchase-related search results. And the third? Simply boredom: we’ve been living in AG for so long that people yearn for something different. If that’s what’s really bugging them, they should remember that solutions are just a click away.

3/20/2022,"Self-criticism, perhaps even regret, is common among writers looking back at old work, but the novelist Ben Okri has now gone so far as to rewrite a whole published novel. And it is a book he already liked quite a lot. The Booker-prize-winning Nigerian author has spent much of the last five years re-crafting his 2008 story Starbook, a mystical romance set in his homeland. A new version, complete with a new title and cover, is to be published this summer as The Last Gift of the Master Artists, and Okri believes that he has given more emphasis to transatlantic slavery, and will now offer his readers a “more considered” narrative. “It was a painstaking and agonising process. I still wanted the book to be magical and innocent but I also want it to be political. It all takes place just before the slave trade – in that moment of foreknowledge,” said Okri this weekend. The changes made were more than cosmetic and gave his treatment of the slave trade more clarity, he said. “Starbook was a book that had cost me a lot emotionally. I paid a price for it, and I think it’s one of my important works,” he said, but when he was asked to give a public reading from it after its publication, he felt that it could be improved. “I never re-read my novels because I don’t like looking back,” said Okri, “but when Starbook came out, I was aware that some of the responses did not pick up on one of the key themes of the book, especially in the central passages, which are all about the slave trade to come. Reviewers are not stupid and if they’re not picking up on something, there’s a reason.” Okri’s publishers, Head of Zeus, said: “The first reception of the book did not reference the slavery aspects or saw them as allegorical. This re-publishing is a chance to put that right in the light of contemporary acknowledgment of historical and current injustices.” So perhaps it is the concerns of readers that have altered? Okri concedes that this is part of it: “Possibly, my audience has changed because of the impact of Brexit and of Covid, and of course of Black Lives Matter and the rise of new feminism. We’ve all been sensitised and opened up to a new discourse. “There is perhaps nothing to gain for me from this but a good artistic night’s sleep,” said Okri. “I didn’t tell anyone I was doing it, and it is just a personal thing. I’m not aware of others doing this.” The wholesale rewriting of published fiction is unusual, unless there are legal imperatives. It is an industry in which financial returns are often marginal, and extensive changes to a novel require issuing a new ISDN number, even for a self-published author who changes their own e-fiction. But six years ago, the American author and television writer Karen Hall did manage a similar feat when her publishing house, Simon & Schuster, put out a hardcover edition of her popular 1996 novel Dark Debts, with significantly revised contents. Hall explained to the New York Times she had “cringed” at the parts of the book she didn’t like. Hall added a character and dropped another, as well as changing the ending, which she felt sounded a false note. The author had won the support of her editor, Jonathan Karp, as the popular novel approached its 20th anniversary. “There are so many books as a publisher where you miss the mark a little bit, either commercially or critically, and I’ve often wondered: why wouldn’t a writer want to try it again?” Karp said at the time. James Joyce rewrote his first attempt at A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, but this was before it had been published, as Okri points out. Charles Dickens, however, did heavily edit Oliver Twist after a Jewish woman, Eliza Davis, wrote to complain about the antisemitic depiction of Fagin. Dickens at first resisted, saying: “I must take leave to say that if there be any general feeling on the part of the intelligent Jewish people that I have done them what you describe as ‘a great wrong’ they are far less sensible, a far less just and a far less good-tempered people than I have always supposed them to be.” Then, in 1867, sensitive to Davis’s argument that his friend Wilkie Collins had presented Jews more favourably, Dickens altered the phrasing in Twist before a reprint of the novel. In the film world, creative revision is more widely accepted. Director’s cuts of hit films, or of films that were controversially edited, often acquire greater cachet than the original. “I would say the director’s cut of Miloš Forman’s film Amadeus, for example, is richer, although the original is great,” said Okri. “It was just that I felt there was something about the tone that allowed the first version to be read as a fairytale. It was a subtle thing really, but it changes the way something can be read. I needed to find a new, quieter tone: something less performative. I had to find a tone that would get this particular subsumed material noticed.” To be worth the effort, the novelist argues, “the urge to go back” must have something important at its core: “It’s been a real labour of love but The Last Gift of the Master Artists is an older, wiser, humbler and more considered book. I guess we could think of it as a reincarnation.”",Arts/Books,Booker winner Ben Okri rewrites published novel to drive home message on slavery,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/19/booker-winner-ben-okri-rewrites-published-novel-to-drive-home-message-on-slavery

Native American advocates criticised Disney and Port Neches-Groves high school after video of the performance to Twitter. “Any Natives who attend [Port Neches-Groves high school] should prolly just accept their classmates dehumanising them cuz ‘tradition’, right?” wrote Tara Houska, an Ojibwe tribal attorney and founder of the Giniw Collective and Not Your Mascots. “Shame on [Disney] hosting this,” she said. “Nostalgic racism is RACISM.” According to the Orlando Sentinel, a Disney employee asked the troupe to remove headdresses prior to their performance. Wahler, the Disney spokesperson, said the performance that followed was “not consistent with the audition tape the school provided and we have immediately put measures in place so this is not repeated”.

According to screenshots posted by Houska, Port Neches-Groves high school, whose band performed the Cherokee fight song, said it was “terribly disheartened by the disrespect with which they were treated at Walt Disney World in Florida”. Houska protested a “special kind of death-grip on obviously racist bullshit”, and pointed out that the school proclaims “Welcome to the Reservation” on its student activities office Twitter account. The activist wrote: “Emailing the school generates a response calling Cherokee Nation ‘extremely dishonorable’ for revoking use of their seal. ‘Welcome to the Reservation’, ‘Pow Wow News’ and ‘War Whoop Year Book’. Srsly wtf.” In recent years, Disney has added disclaimers to some of its older material. It now warns, for instance, that the 1953 film Peter Pan shows indigenous people “in a stereotypical manner”. Other films are flagged for featuring “negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures”. New material is filtered through a diversity and inclusion initiative. Houska told the Orlando Sentinel: “It would be a lot more believable that [Disney] are willing to carry out these values if they unequivocally condemn [the Texas school band’s] behavior, acknowledge their mistake and continue to try to not only increase representation, but prevent something like this from happening again.” According to the National Congress of American Indians, 1,929 schools in the US, from kindergarten to high school, use “Native ‘themed’ school mascots”.",Arts/Film,‘Nostalgic racism is racism’: Disney criticised for Texas students’ performance,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/19/walt-disney-world-apology-texas-high-school-drill-team
3/20/2022,"The FIA has published its inquiry into the controversial finale to the 2021 Formula One season in Abu Dhabi, concluding that the decisions made as race director by Michael Masi which denied Lewis Hamilton the championship were made in “good faith” but that “human error” played a part. It also confirmed the result of the race, which Max Verstappen won to claim the title, stands and that the governing body considers the matter closed. The report is unlikely to satisfy the many people who are deeply unhappy about how the race was handled. It acknowledged that discussions with teams, F1 and drivers had concluded that they had a preference to try to avoid ending races behind the safety car and that in trying to do so in Abu Dhabi “Masi was acting in good faith and to the best of his knowledge given the difficult circumstances”. This was the case, furthermore, “particularly acknowledging the significant time constraints for decisions to be made and the immense pressure being applied by the teams”. However, Masi has since been removed from his post. In reference to Masi’s decision to allow only a certain number of cars to unlap themselves rather than all of them, the wording could well be interpreted as disingenuous. The report stated: “The process of identifying lapped cars has up until now been a manual one and human error led to the fact that not all cars were allowed to un-lap themselves.” The rule has since been changed noting that “all” not “any” cars must be permitted to unlap themselves. They have also now stated the instructions on cars unlapping will be automated. But describing it as “human error” suggests the decision was accidental or unconscious, which appeared not to be the case in Abu Dhabi when Masi made a conscious decision from race control. The other most contentious decision, that Masi allowed the safety car to pit immediately after the lapped cars had unlapped themselves rather than staying out for an extra lap as is stated in the regulations, was acknowledged. The report stated, though, that the rule in questions, Article 48.12 and Article 48.13, could be open to “different interpretation” and this contributed to the decision that was made. Yet if that was the case, it raises the question of why these rules have not subsequently been changed in order to remove any confusion or “interpretation” in future. The statement concluded with what the FIA will hope is a sense of finality but which is unlikely to quell the sense of injustice still felt by many fans. “The results of the 2021 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix and the FIA Formula One World Championship are valid, final and cannot now be changed,” it read.",Sport/Sport,FIA report blames ‘human error’ for Abu Dhabi GP controversy but result stands,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/19/fia-report-blames-human-error-for-abu-dhabi-gp-controversy-but-result-stands
