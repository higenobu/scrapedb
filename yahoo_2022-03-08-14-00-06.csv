We are halfway to our goal. Thank you for the support!"" Kutcher captioned the video on his account, along with the hashtag ""Stand with Ukraine."" The funds have since increased to over $16 million.

We're halfway through,"" said Kunis, who was born in the Ukrainian city of Chernivtsi in 1983. ""We're super-excited, and we want to say thank you to each and every single one of you. It's been an incredible past 48 hours."" After providing the update to their fundraising efforts, Kunis introduced Ryan Petersen, the creator of Flexport, and Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb, to speak further about where the donated funds are being channeled. Kutcher added that more than 30,000 people have already donated to the cause. ""We're halfway there. We're at $15 million, and we're heading to $30. We're going to make this happen,"" he said.

3/8/2022,"Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla says he had a ""heated"" debate with Jared Kushner over COVID-19 vaccine supplies. Bourla told Kushner that the US would have to wait its turn to get an additional 100 million doses. Kushner disagreed, telling Bourla he represented the US government, which could ""take measures"" to enforce its will. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla revealed in a new op-ed published on Forbes that he and Jared Kushner, former President Donald Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, once had a ""heated"" debate over whether the US should receive its vaccine doses first. In the op-ed, Bourla said he and Kushner disagreed over the supply time for an additional 100 million doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 jab that the Trump administration ordered. Bourla wrote that the conflict arose because the US was topping up on its original order of 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine, but that other countries had already signed contracts with Pfizer to secure their vaccine doses. During the early days of the pandemic, Kushner was the head of a COVID-19 shadow task force that a documentary later revealed consisted of young volunteers buying PPE with personal email accounts. ""Jared was asking for a very aggressive delivery plan to the US for the additional 100 million doses. He wanted it all in the second quarter of 2021,"" wrote Bourla. ""To do that, we would have had to take supplies from Canada, Japan, and Latin American countries, all of which had placed their orders earlier than the US and were expecting the vaccine in the second quarter."" Bourla said that the ""debate"" between himself and Kushner became ""heated"" when he refused. The Pfizer CEO said he ""reminded Jared"" it was made clear to Moncef Slaoui, the chief adviser of the Trump team's COVID-19 vaccine plan Operation Warp Speed, that Pfizer would not take doses from other countries to give them to the US. However, Bourla wrote that ""Jared didn't budge."" ""In his mind, America was coming first no matter what. In my mind, fairness had to come first,"" Bourla wrote. ""He reminded me that he represented the government, and they could 'take measures' to enforce their will."" Bourla wrote that he responded to Kushner: ""Be my guest, Jared. I prefer to have Japan's prime minister complaining to you about the cancellation of the Olympics rather than to me."" The CEO said that the disagreement ended when Pfizer's manufacturing team managed to pull through and deliver extra doses to the US without cutting the supply of other countries. ""Jared called me two days later from Mar-a-Lago to thank me for the collaboration, and we closed the loop on a happy note,"" Bourla wrote. The $1.95 billion deal for the additional 100 million Pfizer vaccine doses — enough to fully inoculate 50 million Americans — was finally struck in December 2021.

3/8/2022,"After Katelyn Samples posted a photo of her 10-month-old son on Instagram, a stranger sent her a message with an unnerving question: Had her boy been diagnosed with uncombable hair syndrome? Syndrome. Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post. Samples focused on that word. The worries about Locklan came quickly then: Was there something wrong with him? Was he in pain? ""I'd never heard of it,"" the 33-year-old mother in Roswell, Ga., told The Washington Post in an interview. ""I kind of freaked out."" Although she took him to his pediatrician, uncombable hair syndrome is so rare - scientists know of only about 100 cases, according to WebMD - that the doctor hadn't heard of it, either, forcing the Samples family to visit a specialist in Atlanta. A pathologist there confirmed the Instagram stranger's hunch by diagnosing Locklan with uncombable hair syndrome, or UHS. Samples's fear dissipated; Locklan was not in danger or pain. Uncombable hair syndrome is a rare genetic condition that shows up in children between the ages of 3 months and 12 years, according to the National Institutes of Health and WebMD. The genetic abnormality produces dry, frizzy locks that are silvery-blond or straw-colored. The hair sticks out from the scalp and can't be combed flat. Video: Trump says shower head choice is important to making his hair 'perfect' President Trump spoke to reporters on July 16, 2020, about cutting back efficiency standards on home goods like shower heads, dishwashers and lightbulbs. Samples said that each strand of Locklan's hair has a ""crimp"" in it. ""It can't be tamed,"" she said. ""Nothing can fix it."" In the six months since Locklan's diagnosis, Samples started an Instagram account dedicated to her now 17-month-old boy and his hair - ""uncombable_locks,"" the brainchild of her husband, Caleb. Her ambition is threefold: encourage people to embrace what makes them different, urge those who might have uncombable hair syndrome to get diagnosed so scientists can better understand it, and provide information she wishes she'd had when that stranger first mentioned the condition. ""Because there's not a lot of confirmed diagnosis out there, there's in turn not a lot of information,"" she told The Post. When Samples first started scouring the Internet for details, one of the best resources she found was a Facebook group dedicated to the condition. Veteran UHS parents and people with it have shared tidbits about what could happen to Locklan's hair as he gets older, what hairstyles have worked for them and their favorite products. ""That has been extremely helpful,"" she said. "" . . . It's been comforting."" Samples said her efforts to inform others about UHS and encourage people to seek diagnoses are working. Parents from around the world are sending pictures of their children's hair almost every day, wondering if it's the byproduct of UHS. The photos have come from as close as within Georgia and as far away as Ireland, England, Poland and Australia. One mom, after her brother sent her a news article about Samples and Locklan, had her son diagnosed with UHS. The women have developed a friendship. ""We've been able to connect, which has been really cool,"" she said. Aside from the syndrome, Locklan is developing normally, she said. The only possible symptom is his ""extremely sensitive skin,"" something she said other UHS parents in the Facebook group had encountered. She's also read that some children diagnosed with the syndrome can overheat, something she's noticed in Locklan, although she's not sure whether it's tied to his condition. Locklan's hair gets a lot of attention when he's in public, Samples said. People are curious and nearly everyone is ""just filled with joy and extremely kind,"" Samples said. Some even ask to take photos with him, which Samples is fine with ""as long as the baby is happy and vibing with it."" ""For the most part, it's been very, very positive,"" she said.

3/8/2022,"Russia’s military operation in Ukraine will be “unsustainable” within three weeks, a defence expert has said. Ed Arnold, a research fellow for European security at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank, said Russia is meeting more resistance from Ukrainian troops than it expected. He told the Reuters news agency on Monday: “At the current rate of Russian losses, which are not confirmed, but we do have indications that this operation would be unsustainable within about three weeks from the Russian perspective.” He added: “In which case that they would have to consolidate the gains already made and look to see a way of trying to freeze the conflict on the current lines of advance while they mobilise more forces from Russia.” While Arnold said Russia continues its advance into Ukraine, he described its progress as “slow”. He said: “Within the north, they are still looking to fully encircle Kyiv. “In the south, the Russian advance is continued to be slow but they're seeing a lot more successes in the south, taking Kherson and consolidating and pushing further west, and then also focusing now on Mariupol. “However, at the moment, the Russian operation is going so badly, especially from logistics point of view that really Russia might just not have the numbers to make another conflict that is cold be hot again."" His comments came as Ukraine claimed on Monday it had retaken the city of Chuhuiv from Russian troops. Lieutenant General Serhiy Shaptala said defending Ukrainian forces had seized Chuhuiv from Russian control, killing two high-ranking Russian commanders in the process. Ukraine’s military, the General Staff, said on Facebook: ""In the course of hostilities, the city of Chuhuiv was liberated.

That was adding to the flow of refugees fleeing the country, he said. ""The occupiers suffered heavy losses in personnel and equipment.” Ukrainian and Russian negotiators are expected to sit down for a third round of peace talks on Monday. The discussions will take place in Belarus, close to the border with Poland. In the previous set of talks last Thursday, it was agreed to set up humanitarian corridors to allow refugees to flee Ukraine. But proposed ceasefire attempts in the city of Mariupol collapsed at the weekend. Russia announced new humanitarian corridors on Monday, but Ukraine branded the plans “immoral” as they would lead refugees straight into the arms of Russia and its close ally, Belarus. Meanwhile, the mayor of the Ukrainian port city of Mykolaiv claimed that Russians dropped cluster bombs on residential buildings and a zoo on Monday morning. Russia issued a list of demands on Monday, saying Ukraine must follow four criteria for its invasion to stop.

3/8/2022,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro on Monday said he agreed an agenda for future talks with a U.S. delegation that he met on Saturday, the first high-level meeting between the two countries in years. Officials from the two countries discussed easing oil sanctions on the South American country but made little progress towards reaching a deal, five sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Sunday, part of U.S. efforts to separate Russia from one of its key allies. ""Last Saturday night a delegation from the government of the United States of America arrived in Venezuela, I received it here at the presidential palace,"" Maduro said in a broadcast on state media. ""We had a meeting, I could describe it as respectful, cordial, very diplomatic,"" he said. The meeting lasted two hours, he said, without specifying the topics discussed or who the U.S. delegates were. Sources previously told Reuters the U.S. delegation was led by Juan Gonzalez, the White House's top adviser on Latin America, U.S. Ambassador James Story, as well as Roger Carstens, the United States' presidential special envoy for hostage affairs. Earlier, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the purpose of the trip was to discuss a number of issues, including ""energy security"" and the cases of nine U.S. citizens who are in prison in Venezuela. The talks will continue, Maduro said, without offering a date. ""As I said to the (U.S.) delegation, I reiterate all our will so that from diplomacy, from respect and from the hope of a better world, we can advance in an agenda that allows well-being and peace,"" Maduro said.
