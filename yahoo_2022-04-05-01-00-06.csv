4/5/2022,"The bodies of a Ukrainian mayor, her husband, and their son, have been found in a shallow grave in their village, after Russian forces are reported to have executed the family. Olha Sukhenko, leader of the village of Motyzhyn, together with her husband Ihor Sukhenko and their son Oleksandr, were taken captive by Russian forces two to three days before troops left the village, according to locals. Their bodies were discovered on Monday, covered in sand. Vadym Tokar, head of the Makariv village council which neighbors Motyzhyn, said: ""The bodies are still lying there, we can't get them out because there is a suspicion that they are mined."" Evidence of widespread atrocities committed by Russian troops has emerged in recent days as soldiers withdrew from Kyiv and the surrounding regions. Ukraine's Ministry of Defence released a series of harrowing images on Sunday from the town of Bucha, showing bodies left lying in the street, some with the hands tied behind their backs and shot in the head. Locals said some victims were shot in the eyes by Russian soldiers. Mass graves have been uncovered, and media who have visited the area since the Russians retreat have said there is ""clear evidence"" of war crimes, including torture and rape. The destruction has led to accusations that Vladimir Putin is carrying out a genocide. Russia has denied that its troops have been targeting civilians, saying reports of mass slaughter were ""staged"" to sully Russia's name. Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior ministry, spoke to reporters as he revealed the bodies believed to be the Sukhenko, family. ""There have been Russian occupiers here. They tortured and murdered the whole family of the village head,"" he said. ""The occupiers suspected they were collaborating with our military, giving us locations of where to target our artillery. ""These scum tortured, slaughtered and killed the whole family. They will be responsible for this."" Motyzhyn sits around 30 miles west of Kyiv. Ukrainian authorities have claimed 410 civilians were killed in Bucha and Irpin. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russian forces of torturing and executing hundreds of people in a Facebook post after the bodies were discovered. “I want every mother of every Russian soldier to see the bodies of the killed people in Bucha, in Irpin, in Hostomel,” Zelenskyy said. “What did they do? Why were they killed?” “War crimes in Bucha and other cities during the Russian occupation will also be considered by the UN Security Council on Tuesday,” he added. The UK and allies in the European Union, are said to be preparing to deliver another round of sanctions on Russia following mounting evidence of war crimes committed by its forces in Ukraine. In a statement published on Monday, the European Council said: “The European Union condemns in the strongest possible terms the reported atrocities committed by the Russian armed forces in a number of occupied Ukrainian towns, that have now been liberated. “The massacres in the town of Bucha and other Ukrainian towns will be inscribed in the list of atrocities committed on European soil."" Boris Johnson vowed on Monday that Putin will “never conquer” Ukraine. The PM wrote on Twitter: “Putin will never break the spirit of Ukraine’s people or conquer their homeland. “Ukraine will rise again and take her place among free and sovereign nations once more.” On Sunday, Russia's defense ministry said in a statement all photographs and videos published by the Ukrainian authorities alleging crimes by Russian troops in Bucha were a ""provocation"" and no resident of Bucha suffered violence at the hands of Russian troops. Watch: Ukrainian authorities accuse Putin's forces of committing war crimes Ukrainian authorities accused Putin's forces of committing war crimes and leaving behind a “scene from a horror movie” as they withdrew from the town near Kyiv.View on euronews",World/Yahoo News UK,Ukrainian village leader and her family found shot and buried in shallow grave,https://news.yahoo.com/ukrainian-leader-shot-buried-shallow-grave-145924499.html
4/5/2022,"Russians have seen international firms halt operations and shut shops since the invasion of Ukraine. Some people are selling items like McDonald's food and Starbucks coffee online for higher prices. Grocery stores are also facing goods shortages. Russia is full of closed store fronts and deserted shopping malls after firms have suspended operations in the weeks after the country's attack on Ukraine. A number of retail giants announced they would pause sales and close stores in Russia in the week after the invasion on February 24, including H&M Group, Disney, and IKEA. Other companies had to abandon initial plans to keep stores open. Uniqlo's CEO promised to keep stores operational, but closed them only days later, citing ""operational challenges and the worsening of the conflict situation."" Other big-name outlets are still doing business due to complex franchise agreements with third-party operators... Burger King's parent company, Restaurant Brands International, said it wanted to close stores but could not unilaterally suspend operations, which the main operator ""refused"" to do, according to a letter sent to staff. The local operator later told the BBC that he did not have the ""authority or power"" to halt operations in Russia. Restaurant Brands International did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Some McDonald's chains are also subject to franchise agreements. The fast food giant owns a majority of its Russian stores, meaning most have closed in line with the company's withdrawal from Russia... ... While others are still operational. Some people have been flogging McDonald's goods — including food items, packaging and sauces — online. On Monday, someone posted on the classified-ads website Avito offering McDonald's food delivery for around 1,000 rubles, or $12. Others queued to buy meals before a number of the stores closed. On Reddit, one user posted a video of a traffic jam waiting outside a McDonald's branch, while another uploaded an image of a fridge stockpiled with McDonald's food. Starbucks also halted sales and closed stores in Russia on March 8. Starbucks syrups were being sold on Avito for 2,500 rubles, or around $30, while coffee was going for 5,000 rubles, or almost $60. Other chains, including French retail giant Auchan, said they would keep stores open, despite calls from authorities in Ukraine to withdraw. Auchan's CEO recently told Le Journal du Dimanche that its mission was to ""feed the populations,"" of Russia and Ukraine. A representative for Auchan did not respond to Insider's request for comment when approach on LinkedIn. Sports giant Decathlon — which shares the same parent company as Auchan — recently reversed a decision to keep stores running, citing ""supply conditions"" which had forced the retailer to halt operations. Decathlon stores shut up shop and looked empty only a few days after shoppers were pictured making purchases in its stores. Danish homeware store JYSK announced on March 30 that it would pull out of Russia entirely after temporarily suspending sales for around a month. The store said it would reopen temporarily on March 31 to sell discontinued items before closing permanently. In grocery stores, images of empty shelves emerged as financial sanctions designed to cut Russia off from the global financial system stunted trade and a number of shipping companies withdrew. Sanitary products, coffee capsules, and diapers have been sought after in recent weeks as several international firms pulled out, according to Bloomberg. Russians leaders have urged people not to panic buy, but videos circulating online show people grappling for packets of sugar, multiple outlets reported.

4/5/2022,"Those who initiate wars often begin with an overly optimistic assumption that the fighting will be quick, controllable and that casualties will be low. When many bodies start coming home or are left on the battlefield, it is a sign that the war is none of those things. The Kremlin’s first statement on Russian military casualties in their invasion of Ukraine, on March 2, 2022, noted that 498 soldiers had been killed and 1,597 wounded. And for weeks Russian media continued to suggest, without giving actual figures, that very low numbers of their soldiers have been killed and wounded in Ukraine. But on March 21, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda reported that 9,861 Russian troops have been killed and 16,153 wounded. The report only appeared for a short time before it was removed, and the pro-government newspaper said the numbers were not real but rather the result of a hack. Nonetheless, just days after that report came out, the Kremlin came out with its own new tally, stating that 1,351 soldiers had been killed and 3,825 injured. Meanwhile, on March 24, NATO officials estimated that there have been between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian military deaths. Ukraine officials suggest the true figure is 15,000. While these estimates vary widely, what isn’t in doubt is that people – both in the military and among the general population – are dying and suffering wounds in the fighting. We just don’t know how many. This is not unusual in war. Indeed, there is often nearly as much argument during and after a war about how many soldiers and civilians have been killed and injured, as about any other aspect of a war – including its causes. So why is it difficult to get an accurate figure for how many people have been killed and injured? And is tracking casualties in this war different from other wars? Even though the immediate tactical aim of war is to kill and injure members of the other side’s military while avoiding harming civilians in accordance with international law, it is rarely easy to get accurate, timely figures about civilian and military harm. Estimates often remain just that, estimates. This is true even when militaries keep good records of their own killed and wounded. The number and the perpetrator of civilian casualties is also often contested. Nongovernmental and international organizations have, since the early 2000s, developed methods and attempted to count and sometimes name every civilian casualty. The United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner gives regular reports of the number of civilians killed in Ukraine. It reported that in the first month of the war – from Feb. 24, 2022, to midnight on March 23 – 1,035 civilians were killed, and 1,650 injured. But the U.N. notes that “the actual figures are considerably higher, as the receipt of information from some locations where intense hostilities have been going on has been delayed and many reports are still pending corroboration.” As the U.N. suggests, its figure is an undercount. In late March, the mayor’s office in Mariupol, the place where Russia bombed a maternity hospital on March 9, said that nearly 5,000 people had been killed there alone. It is often difficult in the conditions of a hot war zone to count the dead — their bodies may not be recovered in a timely way or even at all. And when it comes to counting dead, there are many other reasons the numbers may be off. For instance, it may be the case that some soldiers who have been presumed dead – because they could not be accounted for – had actually deserted, were captured or have been wounded and are being cared for in hospitals or in the field. Then there are questions of who belongs in which category. Civilian deaths are sometimes simply denied, as Russia did in its campaign in Syria, and civilians are sometimes counted as combatants. In fact, countries that are seeking to avoid the appearance that they have been reckless or committed a war crime – which involves deliberately targeting civilians – may claim that all those killed and injured in a particular strike were combatants. During the war in Afghanistan, for example, international and Afghan forces sometimes said that all those killed in an attack were militants, although later investigation showed that some or all of those killed were civilians. One of the most famous of these incidents occurred in September 2009, when German forces called in a U.S. airstrike on two fuel tankers surrounded by people attempting to siphon the fuel that had been stolen by the Taliban. NATO said all or most of those killed were militants: “A number of Taliban were killed and there is also a possibility of civilian casualties.” It later emerged that 91 civilians were killed, and compensation was paid to their families. While there are some genuine reasons for uncertainty or inaccuracy in reporting casualties, there are also strategic or political reasons governments might have for publishing misleading figures. In order to maintain morale, countries have an incentive to say that they lost few and the other side lost many. And there are reports that the Russian military, suffering fuel and food shortages as well as stiffer than expected resistance, are struggling with morale. It isn’t just the total number of Russian soldiers who have died in Ukraine but who is being killed that may be of concern to Russian officials. At a recent count, of the 20 or so Russian generals who were sent to Ukraine, at least six have been killed, a devastating blow to the Russian ability to command its forces in the field. Ukrainian military casualties have likewise varied. Earlier in the war, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested that around 1,300 Ukrainian fighters had been killed. More recently, a Ukrainian government spokesperson suggested that the military death toll would not be disclosed until after the conflict ends. There is another, more subtle, problem with understanding the wages of war: the difference between counting direct deaths in war and counting indirect deaths. Direct deaths are those that occur when people are killed by violent means — such as bombs, bullets and the collapse of buildings that result from an attack. Indirect deaths occur when people die because their access to essentials such as food, water, medicine and medical care has been disrupted or lost in a war zone, or when power has been cut or they have been forced to flee and they are left exposed to the elements. People in Ukraine have been displaced at the tail end of winter and left with little food or water. Hospitals appear to have been targeted. Yet, because the causal pathways are sometimes not obvious, or because the chain of events that lead to the harm is long –deaths may occur well after the cessation of fighting – it can be hard to estimate how many indirect deaths have resulted from a particular war. [Over 150,000 readers rely on The Conversation’s newsletters to understand the world. Sign up today.] The ratio of direct to indirect deaths in war varies, but it is increasingly clear that, in most wars, especially where infrastructure is heavily damaged and destroyed, indirect deaths tend to outnumber direct war deaths. As the war in Ukraine progresses, there will be a lot of casualty numbers floating around, with varying degrees of accuracy. But for every person killed or injured by bombs, bullets and fire, more will die because of the effects of war on the country’s infrastructure. And that harm will continue well after the end of the fighting, whenever that might be.
