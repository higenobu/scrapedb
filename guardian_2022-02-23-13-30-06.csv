2/23/2022,"A young bull that was swept into a surging river during flooding on New Zealand’s West Coast has miraculously survived the ordeal, turning up unharmed a week later, 80 kilometres (49 miles) downstream, snuffling about in a blackberry bush. Deer and cattle farmer, Tony Peacock, said the 18-month-old bull was grazing with 37 others in a paddock in the Shenandoah area above the Maruia River, on 10 February, when torrential rain began falling.  “It’s the highest I’ve ever seen on my farm. They forecast 60mm and I tipped out over 160mm from the rain gauge the next morning,” Peacock said. He had not had time to prepare for that amount of rain, and while he was able to save some from the rising waters, the young Hereford and two others were swept away. A week later, Peacock received a surprising phone call from stock-tracking and agricultural company Ospri. “They said a farmer in Westport had one of my bulls and gave me his [ear tag] number. “I rang him and he said he was getting his cows in in the morning when he heard a bit of rustling in the blackberry and a Hereford bull poked his head out.” The farmer told Peacock the bull looked like he needed a bit of “rest and relaxation”. Peacock believes the young bull survived a monumental trip - being swept into the Maruia River, over the 10m-high Maruia Falls, through the joining with the Buller River, under O’Sullivan’s Bridge, and a long winding journey through the Buller River’s rocky upper and lower reaches, and then finally, avoiding being swept out to sea. “It’s a fairly long trip and amazing he survived. I was quite happy when I got the call he was alive. I think he will get legend status now and be put in a paddock to retire with some cows.” He is now waiting on the animal to be put on a truck back home. Peacock said “with the amount of interest in him” the bull would have to get a special welcome home party – most likely, a nice paddock full of grass. The pressure is also building to give his new celebrity a name, but what exactly that would be, was “still under discussion.” The fame could also result in a blind-date for the youngster. “I’ve had a guy ring me today wanting to send a young heifer out to him, to try and get some good breeding stocks,” Peacock said. The bull is not the only ungulate to make headlines for getting themselves into deep water. In 2019, three cows were swept off an island during the raging storm of Hurricane Dorian and located on North Carolina’s Outer Banks, after apparently swimming four miles (6.4 kilometres) during the storm. New Zealand’s West Coast is prone to flooding. In 2021, 500 homes were flooded, with 100 of those deemed uninhabitable. The Buller District Council estimated the two back-to-back floods this month had caused between $21.5 - $43m worth of damage. Peacock’s neighbour lost 70 dairy cows in the flooding, and another neighbour lost 12. He said he was “counting his lucky stars” he lost just two in the end, adding that the community spent hours pulling dead cattle from the blackberry. “It’s pretty gut-wrenching for all concerned.”",News/World news,"Bull survives being swept 80km down a river, over a waterfall and almost out to sea",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/bull-survives-being-swept-80km-down-a-river-over-a-waterfall-and-almost-out-to-sea
2/23/2022,"Eight senior Russian security officials and the oil and gas sectors will be targeted in the first round of Australian sanctions, with the prime minister vowing to go after anyone “aiding and abetting” the invasion of Ukraine. Scott Morrison met with the cabinet’s national security committee on Wednesday before declaring the Russian government was “behaving like thugs and bullies” and there “must be consequences for Russia’s actions”.  Morrison characterised the sanctions as only the first step of Australia’s response and indicated Australian security agencies were on alert for possible counter-actions by Russia such as espionage and cyber attacks. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, earlier this week recognised the independence of two Russian-controlled territories in east Ukraine and sent in what he called a “peacekeeping mission”. Australia will begin by imposing travel bans and targeted financial sanctions on eight members of the Russian Federation’s security council. Morrison said the body had provided Putin with policy advice and justification leading to Monday’s presidential decree that “fundamentally undermines Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”. Australia will also amend its existing sanctions regulations to cover the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk with a focus on sectors including transport, energy, telecommunications, oil, gas and mineral reserves. The Russian state development bank VEB is one of several financial institutions that is expected to be sanctioned. But a statement spelling out the details has not yet been released. Morrison said the government was acting in “lockstep” with the US, the UK and Europe to signal that it was “absolutely unacceptable that Russia could invade its neighbours and seek to extract some concessions or advantage out of threats of terrible violence upon its neighbour”. Morrison acknowledged Australia did not have a large volume of trade with Russia compared with those countries. But he said it was “important that we play our part in the broader international community to ensure that those who are financing and profiting from an autocratic and authoritarian regime that is invading its neighbour should have nowhere to run and nowhere to hide”. “Australians always stand up to bullies,” he said. “This is only the start of this process.” The announcement follows moves by the US, the UK and the EU to introduce a first round of sanctions in response to Putin’s recognition of the two breakaway states. The US president, Joe Biden, said he was determined to “cut off Russia’s government from western financing”. The major Australian political parties are united on the issue. Senior Labor opposition frontbenchers are expected to be briefed by senior officials on Wednesday afternoon. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said earlier on Wednesday that Australia should impose sanctions because “the west must stand united” against Russia’s “fig leaf nonsense about a peacekeeping force”. “This isn’t a peacekeeping force. This is a peace breaking force into a sovereign country of Ukraine and it is completely unacceptable,” Albanese said. The Greens, too, condemned Putin’s “military aggression” against Ukraine “as we condemn all military aggression” and said the government should respond with sanctions. The “peacekeeping mission” means Russia will formally occupy sovereign Ukrainian territory for a second time following the 2014 annexation of Crimea. Putin said in a lengthy speech on Monday that he saw Ukraine as “an inalienable part of our own history, culture and spiritual space”. “These are our comrades, those dearest to us – not only colleagues, friends and people who once served together, but also relatives, people bound by blood, by family ties,” the Russian president said. Putin had been seeking a range of security guarantees from the west, including curbing the expansion of Nato and a promise that Ukraine would never be able to join the military alliance. The Russian government had argued its concerns about Nato’s expansion were legitimate. But Morrison said on Wednesday accepting such demands from Russia would reduce Ukraine to “a nation in name only”. The prime minister said the Chinese government’s language about respecting Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity had improved over the past week, but Beijing should go further in denouncing Moscow’s actions. “We can’t have some suggestion that Russia has some just case here that they’re prosecuting. They’re behaving like thugs and bullies – and they should be called out as thugs and bullies.” Morrison said he had instructed the immigration minister, Alex Hawke, to put Ukrainians applying to come to Australia at “the top of the pile”. The government was looking at various options for humanitarian support, including through skilled migration and student categories, he said. The prime minister said Russia’s ambassador to Australia was being called to a meeting with the head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Canberra on Wednesday – but was not being expelled at this stage. Morrison said the Australian government had “no quarrel with the people of Russia”. He said Australians of Russian background would also be disappointed at Putin’s behaviour. He said his issue was with the actions of “a Russian government, an autocratic, authoritarian government that has forgotten what democracy is and what liberal democracy is”. On Tuesday, the Australian government directed its officials to leave Ukraine “due to the increased risk”. That includes closing the embassy which had already recently moved from the capital Kyiv to Lviv. Australian officials have been deployed to eastern Poland and Romania to provide assistance to Australians who are trying to leave Ukraine. The Russian embassy in Canberra was contacted for comment.",News/Australia news,Australia imposes sanctions on Russia in response to Ukraine crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/23/australia-imposes-sanctions-on-russia-in-response-to-ukraine-crisis
2/23/2022,"In the 1950s, the Soviets came to Antarctica. As part of its contribution to the International Geophysical Year of 1957-8, a global scientific jamboree, the Soviet Union began building research stations across the great southern land – largely in areas claimed by Australia. Amid heightened cold war tensions, Australian officials were not pleased. Government records from the time reveal fears the Soviets might install defence infrastructure in Antarctica; the then foreign minister, Richard Casey, warned of missiles being launched on Sydney or Melbourne. The Australian Antarctic Territory is vast: at approximately 6m square kilometres (just shy of half of the landmass), the territory is almost the size of continental Australia itself. Plenty of room for Soviet missiles.  An article in an Australian periodical, Observer, headlined “We Warn the Tsar”, described the fate of Antarctica as “a matter of foreign policy par excellence”. Notwithstanding the hyperbole, this sentiment was largely echoed in other newspapers of the time. The Advertiser described the Soviet mission as “a potential threat to the security of Australia”, while the Sydney Morning Herald asked, suspiciously: “What are the Russians up to at Mirny [one of their bases]?” Even the head of Australia’s scientific program in Antarctica, after visiting Soviet peers, worried in his diary: “I wonder have they ideas of submarine bases?” I was reminded of these fears – which I had explored during archival research, subsequently published in History Australia journal in 2017 – after the announcement on Tuesday of new funding for Australia’s Antarctic program. Politics and science have always been uneasy bedfellows in Australia’s approach to Antarctica, and the announcement by Scott Morrison of almost a billion dollars in funding over the next decade represented continuity, rather than change. Ever since Australian explorers first traversed the icy landmass at the turn of the 20th century, a blend of sometimes contradictory strategic and scientific motivations have loomed large. The division of new funding between strategic capacity and scientific endeavour underscored this tension: almost $250m for enhanced capabilities – drones, autonomous vehicles, helicopters, mobile stations – and dollops of money for different scientific projects (including $7.4m to understand the impact of climate change on Antarctica – no small irony given this government’s climate policy). Of course these dual motivations are not neatly separable. The enhanced capabilities make more and better science possible. In Antarctic diplomacy, science is the major currency. But for a government that has slashed the university sector to the core during the pandemic, it is obvious that better science is not the sole motive for this funding boost. Strategic concerns are not far from the surface. While the federal government did not name China in the announcement, it is obvious that the regional adversary’s growing interest in Antarctica partially explains Australia’s reinvigorated Antarctic program. As much was made clear by the environment minister, Sussan Ley: “We need to ensure that the Antarctic remains a place of science and conservation, one that is free from conflict and which is protected from exploitation.” The coverage of Tuesday’s news said the quiet part of the government’s announcement out loud. The Australian Financial Review led with “PM pledges $804m to fight cold war in Antarctica”, noting that “the Chinese and Russians have an increasing interest in Antarctica”. The Guardian highlighted recent research from an Australian thinktank, the Lowy Institute, on Australia-China engagement over Antarctica. Chinese authorities are not blind to the strategic implications of this funding boost. Late on Tuesday, China’s state media outlet Global Times hit back: “Australia’s Antarctica plan stems from its hostility toward China”. It remains to be seen whether growing tensions over Antarctica will see a return to the fears of the 1950s. Out of those tensions came the Antarctic treaty, signed in 1959, which banned military activity on the continent and recognised “that it is in the interest of all mankind that Antarctica shall continue for ever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes”. Significantly, the treaty froze territorial claims to Antarctica – including Australia’s – but without renouncing them. Australian efforts in Antarctica therefore always serve a dual purpose: promoting science and conservation while maintaining some degree of involvement across the Australian Antarctic Territory, lest the treaty system ever dissolve. In the Lowy Institute’s report, it was suggested that “China’s Antarctic stations and science seemed designed to position it for a territorial claim in the [Territory] if the Antarctic treaty were overturned”. Such is the lingering sensitivity to these issues that some old records on Australia’s involvement in Antarctica, dating back six or more decades, remain sealed. One file which I tried to access, unsuccessfully, at the National Archives, contained this explanation: “The information canvasses matters relating to Australian sovereignty … and some of these issues still have currency … [public disclosure] could encourage challenges to Australian sovereignty”. But for all that strategic aspirations may sit at odds with the spirit of international cooperation central to scientific collaboration, the experience of the 1950s – Australia’s red scare on ice – suggests that science ultimately transcends politics. Despite the political animosity between Australia and the Soviet Union during the International Geophysical Year, scientists from the two nations developed warm friendships. It probably did not hurt that there were always “a dozen vodkas” involved, too. “Scientists,” wrote one Australian Antarctic official after a visit to a Soviet base in 1958, “can usually get along with each other, whatever the accident of their nationality.”  Kieran Pender is a writer, lawyer and academic",Opinion/Opinion,Cold war on ice?

2/23/2022,"A mother accused of murdering her five-year-old son while he was isolating with Covid screamed for help when she reported him missing, a jury has heard. Angharad Williamson, 30, her partner John Cole, 40, and a 14-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, deny murdering Logan Mwangi between 28 July and 1 August.  At their trial at Cardiff crown court, the jury was played a recording of a 999 call made by Williamson on 31 July to report her son missing from their home in the village of Sarn, near Bridgend. She is heard to scream “help me please” before saying she had woken up and found her son was not there. During the 13-minute-long call, Williamson repeatedly suggests that another woman may have taken him. She said: “He can’t be on his own, there’s no parent with him, he must be scared.” She tells the call handler: “My back gate is open, my back gate is open” before stating that her partner is out looking for Logan. She says: “Logan has had Covid for the past week so he has been in lockdown for the past week. He has never had symptoms. Please help me. He’s my baby. I can’t just stand here and do nothing. Please, I’m begging you. He’s my baby.” Williamson, Cole and the 14-year-old are also accused of conducting a cover-up after his death which included dumping his body in the river like “fly-tipped rubbish”. Williamson cried as the court was told of the moment Logan’s dead body was found in the River Ogmore by two South Wales police officers at 5.55am on 31 July. He had suffered 56 injuries to his head, face, torso, arms and legs, the jury heard. Caroline Rees QC, prosecuting, said that when taken to see her son’s body in hospital, Williamson told a nurse “that she wished she’d taught him to swim”. She later asked another nurse why Logan was wet. Williamson claimed it was the first time she had been made aware of this, the court heard, which Rees said was considered an odd comment given her earlier statement about not teaching Logan to swim. Rees told the hearing that medical experts had found Logan suffered catastrophic injuries to his abdomen, including lacerations to his liver and a tear to his bowel, as well as traumatic brain injuries. Rees said the evidence was “capable of proving that Logan was subjected to a serious and sustained assault within the home over a period of time and possibly on more than one occasion”. “It is incredible to consider that any person within that house – so that would include all of the defendants in this case – could have been unaware that the assault was going on or that Logan had been seriously injured and was at high risk of death.” The court heard the three defendants made comments about the case after their arrests. Cole is said to have told a prison guard that he had a “moral dilemma”, while Williamson wrote a letter claiming that Cole had killed Logan, it was claimed. The youth is alleged to have been observed singing: “I love kids, I fucking love kids, I love to punch kids in the head, it’s orgasmic.” He is later claimed to have said: “I might plead guilty next week”. Concluding her opening remarks Rees said: “We say that each defendant played their part in the death of a little five-year-old, Logan, and it is clear from the terrible injuries that he sustained that that must have been with the intention to kill or at the very least cause really serious injury.” The trial continues.",News/UK news,Mother accused of killing son ‘screamed for help when reporting him missing’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/22/mother-accused-of-killing-son-screamed-for-help-when-reporting-him-missing
