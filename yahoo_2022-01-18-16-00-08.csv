1/18/2022,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong police said they have arrested and charged two former flight attendants over allegations they broke the city's coronavirus rules. The statement, which was published late on Monday, did not name the airline but the announcement comes after Cathay Pacific said in January it had fired two aircrew who were suspected of breaching COVID-19 protocols. Police said the two had returned to Hong Kong from the United States on Dec. 24 and 25 where they had ""conducted unnecessary activities"" during their home isolation period. They both later tested positive for the fast-spreading Omicron strain. If convicted, they could face up to six months in prison and a fine of up to HK$5,000 ($642). They have been released on bail with their case to be heard on Feb. 9. Hong Kong's flagship carrier has faced blame for the initial spread of Omicron into the community, with leader Carrie Lam singling out Cathay and launching two investigations into the company. Chairman Patrick Healy said the company was cooperating with the government on the probes, which focus on non compliance with coronavirus rules and rostering of crew onto cargo flights, according to an internal video to staff that was reviewed by Reuters. Hong Kong has continually adjusted its quarantine rules for air crew, dramatically tightening them after the Omicron outbreak in late December, leading the airline to cancel most of its planned passenger and cargo flights in January. The airline had been struggling to staff many flights even before the rules were tightened, as some destinations relied on pilots volunteering to fly punishing rosters involving five weeks locked in hotel rooms. Healy said Cathay's crew had spent more than 62,000 nights in Hong Kong's quarantine hotels in 2021, with none contracting COVID-19 for the first eight months of the year. All are fully vaccinated. Hong Kong is following mainland China's zero-tolerance approach to control COVID-19 as the rest of the world shifts toward living with the coronavirus. Unlike the mainland, the global financial hub is quite dependent on business travellers and imported goods. ($1 = 7.7900 Hong Kong dollars) (Reporting by Farah Master.

Former President Donald Trump may lose one of his most outspoken supporters yet — Fox News host Laura Ingraham. Ingraham fell short of expressing full support for a 2024 Trump presidential run when interviewed for a story published this week in Northern Virginia Magazine. ""I'm not saying I'm there for him yet,"" Ingraham said when asked if she would back Trump in 2024 if he were to run. ""But I think whether he runs or not — I mean, his policies worked,"" Ingraham added. ""Trump's blueprint for policy — a forward-looking, optimistic set of pro-America policies — that blueprint, without a doubt, is winning."" Trump has not yet announced a presidential run and said in November that he will ""probably"" wait until after the midterm elections to decide whether to make a presidential bid in 2024. In December, the January 6 House Select Committee revealed Ingraham was one of several Fox News hosts who sent panicked texts to former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows during the Capitol riot. ""Mark, the president needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home. This is hurting all of us. He is destroying his legacy,"" Ingraham texted Meadows during the insurrection. Insider's Jake Lahut reported in January that another text from Ingraham warned Meadows that Trump's support for armed rioters would not play well. ""Remarks on camera discouraging protest at state capit[o]ls esp with weapons will be well advised given how hot the situation is,"" Ingraham texted Meadows, according to the committee's letter. ""[E]veryone needs to calm down and pray for our country and for those who lost their lives last week.""
