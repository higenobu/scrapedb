5/14/2022,"Scientists may have come a step closer to uncovering the causes for sudden infant death syndrome in a study that has been hailed as a significant advance by the British scientist whose work underpinned the Back to Sleep campaign of the 1990s. The study is the first to identify a biochemical marker in the blood that is linked to the risk of Sids, sometimes called cot death, when an apparently healthy infant dies during their sleep. Although the test is not accurate enough to be used in newborn screening, it hints that abnormally low levels of a chemical linked to the brain’s arousal system could be involved in causing these babies to die suddenly in their sleep. “This is a very important observation,” said Prof Peter Fleming, of the University of Bristol, whose work is credited with preventing tens of thousands of UK baby deaths after the Back to Sleep campaign launched in the 1990s. “If this is telling us something new about the mechanism, then that’s very important.” The investigation was led by Dr Carmel Harrington, an honorary research fellow at the Children’s hospital at Westmead, New South Wales, who lost her own son, Damien, to Sids 29 years ago. Harrington and colleagues compared dried blood samples taken during the newborn heel prick test from 655 healthy babies, 26 babies who died from Sids and 41 babies who died in infancy from other causes. They found that the Sids babies had lower levels of an enzyme called Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), which plays a major role in the brain’s arousal pathway. This could indicate an arousal deficit, which reduces an infant’s ability to wake or respond to the external environment, such as overheating or a blanket over the face. This could cause vulnerability to Sids, the scientists said. “Up to now we didn’t know what was causing the lack of arousal,” said Harrington. “Now that we know that BChE is involved we can begin to change the outcome for these babies and make Sids a thing of the past. “An apparently healthy baby going to sleep and not waking up is every parent’s nightmare and until now there was absolutely no way of knowing which infant would succumb.” However, at this stage testing for BChE wouldn’t be helpful as a newborn screening tool. Although the Sids babies had lower levels on average, there was also a lot of overlap between the groups, with about half of the Sids babies falling within the same range as half of the babies who did not die. The biomarker was also not as powerful a predictor as some previously known environmental factors, such as smoking during pregnancy, which is linked to a more than threefold increase in Sids incidence. Babies with low BChE had a 1.1-1.5 times higher risk of Sids. “The thing that worries me – and I’ve already had calls from bereaved families – is that at this stage it isn’t usable by the individual,” said Fleming. “It’s useful at the population level.” The findings could help explain how smoking in pregnancy leads to biological changes that put babies at greater risk of Sids, for instance. “It needs a lot more investigation,” said Fleming. Jenny Ward, the chief executive of the Lullaby Trust, said: “The findings of this study are interesting and more work needs to be done. We look forward to seeing more as this research continues and hope that it helps us understand more about sudden infant death syndrome.” She added that it was important that the findings should not be viewed as a reason to downplay safer sleep advice, including “always sleeping baby on their back in a clear sleep space on a flat, firm and waterproof mattress with no bulky bedding, pillows or cot bumpers.” The findings are published in the Lancet journal eBioMedicine.",News/Society,Enzyme in babies’ blood linked to risk of sudden infant death syndrome,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/13/enzyme-in-babies-blood-linked-to-risk-of-sudden-infant-death-syndrome
5/14/2022,"Investigative reporting is in the Guardian’s DNA. Our unique ownership structure allows us to expose wrongdoing and scrutinise power with complete independence. Our massive global audience – and reputation for trusted journalism – mean that our stories have real impact. We have built a formidable reputation for investigative journalism over decades and are known for major stories: Windrush, the Pegasus Project, the Edward Snowden files, Cambridge Analytica, the Panama, Paradise and Pandora Papers, the phone hacking scandal, the Noel Clarke revelations, the Owen Paterson lobbying affair and the long-running ‘spy cops’ scandal (to name a few). We’re proud of our biggest scoops, but just as important to us are the hidden truths we unearth on a daily basis, which can come from anywhere in the newsroom. We’re acutely aware that small stories often lead to bigger ones, and we encourage all our journalists to dig deep. The investigations team is a dedicated unit of six journalists (plus me as the head of investigations), whose job it is to ferret out the hardest-to-reach, most impactful stories. We’re pleased to announce that we’re now expanding the team, creating a number of new roles, including a deputy investigations editor and several new investigations correspondents. This expansion has been enabled by a major investment by the Guardian, which signals the editor–in–chief Katharine Viner’s ambitions for accountability-driven reporting. We are looking for candidates with a proven track record in investigative journalism, although that can involve a broad range of roles. There is no single mould for an investigative reporter – we hope to build a diverse ensemble of journalists with different backgrounds, skills and expertise. New members of the team may have experience in reporting on tech, politics, kleptocracy, disinformation, sport, sexual abuse, migration or financial crime – or they could be a generalist who relishes deep dives into unknown waters. It is not essential that candidates have a long list of award-winning investigations to their name. But it is important that they can demonstrate they have the potential to excel on the team, with the skills, attributes and determination we believe this kind of work requires. We are seeking candidates who can demonstrate diverse perspectives, and particularly welcome applications from candidates who are Black, Asian and minority ethnic or from other underrepresented groups in the UK media. Successful candidates are likely to be tenacious, shrewd and creative – and unwilling to give up on their stories easily. They will work well under pressure, and will preferably have experience operating under UK media laws.

5/14/2022,"In much the same way that the Fiver used to be much better 20 years ago, so was the FA Cup final. The TV coverage would begin at 10am with TV reporters from BBC and ITV joining the players of both teams in their hotel dining rooms for breakfast, before travelling with them on their coaches to … er, the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. In those days, they’d all be suited and booted for the day and viewers would be treated to footage of them playing cards, chatting, sitting frozen in nervous terror or listening to their Walkmans (ask your folks). Invariably, some luckless sod from each team that happened to be missing the game through injury would be roped into introducing assorted teammates he thought might up for a bit of performative “banter” for the cameras. Then at 3pm, after hours of buildup the teams would kick off and 90 or 120 minutes later the famous old trophy would be handed over. In the intervening years, it has not gone unnoticed that the FA Cup has lost so much of its magic, that even the act of pointing out it has lost its magic has lost its magic. Indeed, you could now go so far as to say that we have reached the point of peak FA Cup magic-loss, in so far as pointing out that the competition has lost its magic has not only lost its magic, but even pointing out that pointing out it has lost its magic has lost its magic. But while FA Cup final day is a pale facsimile of the great day it once was, it is still a showpiece event well worth winning.

5/14/2022,"Seth Meyers took aim at the Democratic party on Thursday Night, shifting focus from his usual target, Donald Trump. “Obviously, it’s critical that we as a nation do everything in our power to prevent this obviously unhinged demagogue and his allies in the Republican party from regaining power,” he said. “And that unfortunately is where the Democrats come in. Oof. It’s like if you said ‘Avengers assemble,’ and only Hawkeye showed up. “If you’ve been paying any attention at all to politics, you know that Democrats are in dire straits right now,” he continued. “You don’t need a poll to tell you that. All you have to do is watch any Joe Biden press conference with the sound off. He’s always doing that thing where he leans over the podium like every question is causing him physical pain. “Things are bad for Democrats,” he added, “and that’s not just me saying that.” Meyers pointed to the California representative Katie Porter, who warned her Democratic colleagues to act immediately to ease the cost of living under inflation or face dire consequences at the polls. After an emotional speech about her family’s struggle with inflation prices during a private caucus meeting last week, Porter told Politico that it seemed like the first time the personal toll of inflation had sunk in for many of her colleagues. “Just to be clear, I’m not saying inflation is somehow the Democrats’ fault,” said Meyers. “They just happen to be in charge now, so it’s on them to do something about it. “It is on Democrats to do something to improve people’s lives,” he added, calling on lawmakers to extend the child tax credit, invest in green infrastructure, forgive student loan debt or expand healthcare. “Look, I get it – Joe Manchin is a giant ass ache. The dude rakes in cash from fossil fuels, drives a Maserati and lives in a yacht called Almost Heaven, which sounds less like the name of a yacht and more like the title of an early 2000s romcom starring Ryan Reynolds and Mandy Moore. “Manchin has been stringing Democrats along for over a year now,” Meyers continued, “so Democrats just have to call his bluff and say ‘what will you accept? We will pass it.’” Which is why it’s frustrating, Meyers said, to read reports that Democrats are hesitating to put together a new Build Back Better bill reflecting Manchin’s terms after he killed it five months ago. “Call Manchin’s bluff and ask him what he wants,” Meyers concluded. “If Manchin’s bullshitting and his answer is actually that he’s opposed to everything – which is very possible – then at least we’ll know. And we can move on.” In Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel remarked on the first official report by North Korea of Covid in the country. “How did Covid even get into North Korea?

Kimmel pivoted to remarks by Joe Biden at a Democratic fundraiser in response to the leaked supreme court draft opinion overturning Roe v Wade. The draft decision “basically says there’s no such thing as the right to privacy. If that holds ... mark my words: they are going to go after the supreme court decision on same-sex marriage,” Biden said. “They’ll come for same-sex marriage, they’ll come for interracial marriage, they’ll outlaw that peanut butter that comes with the jelly in the same jar,” Kimmel quipped. “These guys – they might as well just come out and say, ‘listen, here’s the real story: if we can’t get laid, nobody else is going to have any fun either.”",Arts/Culture,Seth Meyers: ‘It is on Democrats to do something to improve people’s lives’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/may/13/seth-meyers-democrats-inflation-jimmy-kimmel
5/14/2022,"Two US patients have recovered from intractable infections after being treated with a pioneering therapy involving genetically engineered bacteria-killing viruses. The cases raise hopes that so-called phage therapy could be used more widely to combat the global crisis of drug-resistant infections. One of the patients, Jarrod Johnson, a 26-year-old man with cystic fibrosis, was approaching death after suffering a chronic lung infection that resisted treatment by antibiotics for six years. After being given the phage therapy, his infection cleared allowing him to receive a lung transplant and resume an active life. “I am so grateful for the effort, persistence and creativity of all the people who were involved in my treatment,” said Johnson, who lives in Denver. “I thought I was going to die. They have literally saved my life.” The other patient, a 56-year-old man with severe arthritis, showed a remarkable recovery from a skin infection that was taking hold of his body and which had proved untreatable with conventional drugs. The team, who also developed the breakthrough treatment of a British teenager four years ago, say these latest cases will pave the way for a clinical trial of phage therapy, which could launch as soon as next year. “These two reports really provide substantial encouragement for phage treatments for patients where antibiotics not only fail to control the infections, but also contribute substantial toxicity,” said Prof Graham Hatfull, whose team at the University of Pittsburgh developed the therapies. Prof Martha Clokie, a microbiologist at the University of Leicester who was not involved in the work, said: “There is a growing feeling within the clinical community … that phages could be part of the solution for patients, especially with those that really at the moment have no other alternative option. The overall need for alternatives for antibiotics is huge.” In 2019, 1.2 million people are estimated to have died globally as a direct cause of antimicrobial resistant infections and in about 5 million people, a multi-drug-resistant infection contributed to their death. Bacteriophages, phages for short, are harmless viruses that are natural enemies of bacteria. Hatfull has spent nearly four decades amassing a collection of phages, stored in 20,000 frozen vials in his lab. “We’ve got a large collection of phages, and we’ve sequenced over 4,000 of their genomes, so we understand their genomic profiles and relationships in exquisite detail,” he said. Since the 2019 British case, the team has been inundated with requests from doctors who had run out of treatment options for patients. “That’s when the floodgates opened,” said Dr Rebekah Dedrick, a research associate in Hatfull’s lab. “We started to get requests from around the world, and we still get them.” One of these was Dr Jerry Nick, director of the adult cystic fibrosis programme at National Jewish Health in Denver. His patient, Jarrod, has cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that results in frequent infections clogging up the lungs with mucus. By 2020, his lungs had less than a third of their normal function and he had been plagued by a stubborn bacterial strains for six years. He was rejected for a lung transplant due to the high risk of the infection spreading once he was on immunosuppressant drugs. “In the year before the operation, he was admitted to hospital 11 times and for 200 days in total,” said Nick. “He was approaching death and probably had a year left.” In 2016, Nick and his colleagues had sent samples of the Mycobacterium abscessus from Johnson’s lungs to Hatfull’s lab in the hope of finding a phage that could eliminate it. But phages are often specific for only a few types of bacteria so Hatfull and his team screened dozens of candidates before finally identifying two that efficiently killed the bacteria. They then genetically engineered the phages to boost their efficiency. Johnson was treated with a combination of the phages and antibiotics for just over a year, requiring two daily intravenous injections, which cleared the infection, allowing him to have a lung transplant. His body developed some antibodies against the phages, but this happened slowly enough that the phages were able to get rid of the bacteria, quicker than the antibodies killed off the phage. Since treatment, Johnson has finished high school, been working, met a girlfriend and although he has had some complications from the transplant, overall Nick says he is doing well. The second patient, the 56-year-old man with arthritis, developed a serious skin infection, which is a risk among those on immunosuppressive drugs. He was treated with a single phage, called Muddy, which had been discovered in a sample taken from the underside of a decomposed aubergine. After a few weeks his skin lesions cleared and after two months he tested negative for the bacteria on a biopsy. He was treated for more than eight months in total. The cases are described in the journals Cell and Nature Communications.",News/Science,‘Phage therapy’ successes boost fight against drug-resistant infections ,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/may/13/phage-therapy-fight-against-drug-resistant-infections-antibiotics
5/14/2022,"Are you unfazed by heights, able to swim, not visibly tattooed, either taller than 5 ft 2in or possessed of extraordinarily long arms, and able to survive on £16k basic a year? Then there is a pretty good chance an airline needs you. Cabin crew are just a few of the roles the aviation sector has been desperately trying to fill after the bounceback from Covid. Employees were axed en masse as the pandemic hit and flights were grounded, with British Airways alone shedding 10,000 people. Now those aviation businesses that cut to the bone have been unable to recruit fast enough after the government suddenly lifted all travel restrictions in March, fuelling a surge in bookings. At the more glamorous end of aviation, there is still no shortage of applicants: BA is holding wings ceremonies, where newly qualified cabin crew are given their silver winged badges, almost daily. Natasha Dicks, 21, of Swindon, is one of those who made it through, working her first flight from Heathrow to Edinburgh earlier this month. She first applied in 2019, but was put on hold when Covid arrived, and went to work in the hotel business instead. This time, BA called her. Five-and-a-half weeks of training included simulating emergency evacuations – “People were shouting, who are you, what are you? I didn’t have time to put on my yellow tabard and they thought I was a pretend passenger” – before Dicks and her cohort of 12 trainees got their wings, in front of friends and family, in BA’s museum at its Waterside HQ at Heathrow. For her, the long wait was worth it: “It’s my dream job – I’ve always wanted to do this.” But other parts of aviation are beginning to realise that loyal staff are hard to come by – particularly in the more thankless tasks such as airport security. Staff shortages that led to chaotic scenes in departure lounges at Easter continue to play out. Last week, Manchester airport was still grappling with 90-minute security queues, while Birmingham International forced passengers to wait outside its terminals, so they could tell which queue was which. The Midlands airport laid off almost half its staff during the pandemic. Both are in the midst of training up new security officers – and like virtually all airlines and airports, have been racing to recruit. However, they have emerged into a much tighter labour market – and having paid staff to leave, many businesses are now forced to offer incentives to get them back. BA is offering sign-on bonuses of £1,000 for “below wing” jobs, in ground-handling roles, while ground handlers at Gatwick, employed by firms such as DHL, Menzies and Swissport, have secured 10% pay rises. Sharon Graham, general secretary of the Unite union, which negotiated the deal, said the union had “consistently warned aviation employers that unless they address the sector’s poor pay and conditions, they will struggle to recruit and retain the workers they need”. Other sectors, such as logistics, retail and warehousing, have also struggled to find staff, having also lured former aviation workers with better pay and more sociable hours during the pandemic. Security checks have delayed and complicated recruitment. Those working in sensitive roles at airports require employment history dating back five years – no longer straightforward when many have been driven into gig economy roles, or worked for firms who may have gone bust in lockdown. Many applicants – either with better offers, or too cash-strapped to wait – have gone elsewhere before the process is completed. Manchester airport says more than 500 people are currently going through background checks and security training, although only 200 new starters were expected to join this month. Brexit is also a factor: cabin crew roles at Luton were once advertised, and directly recruited from, places such as Madrid. Now the likes of easyJet, fishing in a smaller pool for UK jobs, are ever more sensitive to the poaching of qualified crew, and are offering a retention bonus to those who see out the summer. While airlines are increasing staff numbers in anticipation of customers, airports are less sure: Heathrow says the current rush is a blip and is reluctant to expand too fast, despite saying it is taking on 1,000 more staff. Heathrow argues that customers are still using credit notes or vouchers from cancelled trips, with the pent-up demand from two years of travel fuelling a temporary boom. That unlikely to last it says, as risks to flight demand include a UK recession, the full effect of rising fuel prices and the cost of living squeeze to come, and with Covid far from eradicated. The stance has provoked a furious row with airlines such as Virgin Atlantic and BA, which accuse it of reducing their space to operate while upping the landing charges they pay, on the back of a gloomy prognosis. Nonetheless, without the staff – either their own or the airports – airlines are having to clip their owns wings. EasyJet took the extraordinary step of physically detaching seats from its aircraft to allow them to fly with fewer crew under UK regulations – and British Airways has cancelled 10% of flights until the end of October. Long-serving employees who were jettisoned in the bad times may struggle to sympathise.

5/14/2022,"The Breach is packed full of shocks. A story of double rape as well as suicide and a workplace death that leaves a father’s limbs scattered across a construction site, it is told from the point of view of two siblings doing everything they can to hold on to their lives. Its two time-frames capture the extent of love and sacrifice between tough-cookie Jude (portrayed in the 1970s scenes by Shannon Tarbet and in the 90s by Jasmine Blackborow) and Acton (Stanley Morgan), the bullied younger brother who is dead by the later years. Scenes alternate between then and now in the same Kentucky town. The siblings are shown to be close and protective, even as Acton forms a bond with two boys whose companionship keeps him safe from school bullies. The dangerous games played in adolescence carry shades of Spring Awakening. In the 90s scenes, we learn how Jude was raped as part of a perverse pact by the boys, presaging a reckoning between Jude and her aggressors. Except, for all its powerful themes, the reckoning in Naomi Wallace’s play never hits hard enough. There is mystifyingly stolid direction from Sarah Frankcom; actors stand statically on a bare stage and it is hard to fathom the effect this stillness is reaching for. If it is intensity, it does not succeed. The first half feels strangely sleepy. There is a little more movement in the second half but the actors, when they have their confrontations, often look into the distance or at the ground as they speak. As a play about consent, violation and powerlessness – economic and sexual – its ideas are not conveyed with nearly enough clarity or depth. Jude is both a willingly sacrificial lamb and a defiant hero, refusing to see herself as a victim after the rape. But her psychology is not explained clearly enough and her behaviour raises many unanswered questions. The older Jude seems largely numb or blase, so it is hard to feel her trauma or know her intentions. Her abusers (played by Douggie McMeekin and Tom Lewis in the later years) plead their own victimhood. They were minors when they raped her and have been haunted by the incident ever since. That argument is under-explored, as well as petulant and distasteful. “You were the hottest girl I ever had. I know it sounds kind of twisted …” says Hoke, and the drama moves on rather than unravelling the impact of these odious words on Jude. There are many such moments and none of the characters seem backed into a corner, emotionally. If power and class are being explored through the frame of consent, the meaning is oblique. The play touches on themes of deregulation, blue-collar exploitation and unsafe work environments in Reagan-era America, but does not take any of this much further than the repeated information that Jude and Acton’s father was killed in a fatal fall at work. We hear that their mother is on strike, that Hoke’s family runs the construction firm on which the children’s father died. Where this might have been better metabolised within the play, his death becomes little more than a morbid game for the children. Wallace’s dialogue has a self-conscious theatricality and lyrical contrivance that sound jarring in the mouths of these characters. The tone is odd too: Hoke speaks of having to get back home for “movie night” while he is in the middle of discussing the rape with Jude. And she herself breaks off, suddenly, while talking about her brother’s death, to muse on her preferred method of suicide. None of it feels true or even ironic, just perplexing.

5/14/2022,"The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has cast doubt on Finnish and Swedish membership of Nato, saying he does not have a positive opinion of the two Nordic nations joining the military alliance after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. His remarks came as a Swedish parliamentary security review said membership would reduce the risk of conflict in northern Europe and a day after neighbouring Finland said it aimed to join the alliance. Finland and Sweden, while both Nato partners, have long viewed membership as an unnecessary provocation of Russia, their powerful eastern neighbour. Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, however, has led to a radical rethink of their security policies. Membership of Nato would require ratification by all existing members, and Erdoğan remarked to journalists after leaving Friday prayers in Istanbul that Turkey would not welcome either. “We are currently following developments regarding Sweden and Finland, but we don’t feel positively about this,” he said. Turkey has been a Nato member since 1952 and its membership remains a cornerstone of its foreign policy towards western countries. The comments appeared directed at the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which Turkey regards as a terrorist organisation, although they appeared to encompass the communities of Kurdish origin in Scandinavia as a whole. “We don’t want to commit a mistake,” he added. “Scandinavian countries are like guesthouses for terrorist organisations. To go even further, they have seats in their parliaments, too.” Sweden has a large Kurdish diaspora, and prominent Swedish citizens of Kurdish origin currently include six members of parliament. The Turkish authorities have not provided any evidence for claims that the parliamentarians have links with the PKK or similar groups outside Sweden. The Kurdish-speaking population of Finland was estimated at just over 15,000 people as of 2020, less than 0.3% of the population. Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, on Friday urged patience and called for a gradual approach in response to Turkey. “We need some patience in this type of process, it’s not happening in one day … Let’s take issues step by step,” he told reporters. Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, and president, Sauli Niinistö, on Thursday said the country “must apply for Nato membership without delay”. Government confirmation of the decision is expected on Sunday, with parliamentary assent likely early next week. Sweden’s ruling Social Democrats will also decide whether to formally approve joining Nato on Sunday and are widely expected to drop decades of opposition to membership. Parliament will debate security issues on Monday. The security review published on Friday did not make a recommendation, but said developing defence alliances outside existing structures was not realistic. “Swedish Nato membership would raise the threshold for military conflicts and thus have a conflict-preventing effect in northern Europe,” said the country’s foreign minister, Ann Linde, presenting the report’s conclusions. “The most important consequence of Swedish membership would be that Sweden would be a part of Nato’s collective security and included in security guarantees according to article 5 [of the alliance’s founding treaty],” she said. Article 5, the cornerstone of the US-led defensive alliance, states that an attack on one Nato member is an attack on all and commits its current 30 members to defend each other in the event of armed aggression. The Swedish report, due to be debated in parliament on Monday, noted that “within the framework of current cooperation, there is no guarantee that Sweden would be helped if it were the target of a serious threat or attack”. The Expressen daily has reported that a special cabinet meeting will be called after Monday’s parliamentary debate, with the prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, likely to send Sweden’s membership application to Nato by the end of the day. Not all the ruling Social Democrats’ party members are automatically in favour. “I think everybody would have wanted more time for this, because it’s a huge issue,” Stefan Löfven, the prime minister from 2014 to 2021, told Agence France-Presse. Moscow has previously warned that Finnish and Swedish Nato membership would force it to “restore balance” by strengthening its defences in the Baltic, including by deploying nuclear weapons in Kaliningrad, between Poland and Lithuania. Linde noted that Finnish and Swedish Nato membership would be considered “negative” by Russia. She said neither country expected a “conventional military attack” in reaction but added that “an armed assault cannot be ruled out”. The Swedish defence minister, Peter Hultqvist, said on Friday: “If Sweden chooses to seek Nato membership, there is a risk of a reaction from Russia. Let me state that, in such a case, we are prepared to deal with any counter-response.” Public support for Nato membership in Finland, which shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia, has more than trebled to about 76% since Russia’s onslaught on Ukraine, and has risen to about 60% in Sweden. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said both countries would be “welcomed with open arms” and that the accession process would be quick, although formal approval by all the alliance’s members could take several months.",News/World news,Erdoğan: Turkey ‘not positive’ about Sweden and Finland joining Nato,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/13/erdogan-turkey-not-feeling-positive-about-sweden-and-finland-joining-nato
