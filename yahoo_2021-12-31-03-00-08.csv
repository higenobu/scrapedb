""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below."" At 52, Ree Drummond is feeling stronger than ever. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, The Pioneer Woman revealed she recently lost over 50 pounds. Drummond was inspired to make healthier changes after “hitting rock bottom” one night while indulging in chips and salsa. “I thought that night, 'I am going to start tomorrow, I am doing something different,'” she said. The Food Network star said her family played a huge role in helping her stay motivated in her weight loss journey. Drummond was working to get in shape ahead of her daughter Alex's wedding, and then when her husband Ladd was injured in an accident on their ranch, he became her source of motivation. “[Ladd] was in his neck brace kind of immobilized, but he was training me in the living room telling me to get lower with my lunges and my squats,” she said. “He was like, ‘You’re not doing it right!' So he was sort of my unexpected trainer during that whole ordeal.” And although Drummond said she’s never really “been a squatter or lunger” before, she’s feeling stronger than ever thanks to her new routine. “It’s really nice to just kind of feel the muscles that I thought were gone forever,” she said. “I feel great... I feel strong.” “I feel great and that’s what matters,” she continued. “The scale was sort of a gauge for me that I was heading in the right direction. It was never about I have to lose this amount, it’s really about how I feel,” she said. This isn’t the first time Drummond has been open about her decision to make some changes. In 2019, she wrote on Instagram that it took her “two full seasons” to achieve similar goals. Here’s everything we know about the Food Network star’s approach.
 Drummond gave her rowing machine a shout-out back in 2019, but more recently, she’s been all about taking walks around her ranch. Thanks to the company of her dogs and good podcast, it’s been an enjoyable form of exercise. In a viral TikTok video, the celebrity chef added she started lifting weights—a key exercise for not only burning fat, but strengthening the entire body. Lifting weights has tons of benefits. It builds muscle, which ultimately helps you burn more calories at rest (i.e. even when you’re not exercising!). Plus, it’s a great stress reliever, improves posture, and even protects your bones and joints. “It changes your whole outlook just having the routine of exercise in your day,” she told Entertainment Tonight.    A post shared by Ree Drummond - Pioneer Woman (@thepioneerwoman) In the past, Drummond has admitted to drinking weight loss shakes, but that mentality is totally gone. Even though she’s eating fewer calories, she’s still loading up protein to ensure she feels full and satisfied in between meals. And let’s be real, a pro chef isn’t going to stop eating her favorite foods entirely. She captioned the viral TikTok video, “Moving more and building muscle has been the key for me! I still love fries, though.” Now, she’s just conscious of her portion sizes. “I still eat the foods that I cook my family. I still eat cake,” the celebrity chef said. “I just eat a Rhode Island-sized piece instead of a Texas-sized piece.” Drummond has previously followed a low-carb diet, and even hopped on the keto train momentarily. “Last summer, I kind of dove into the keto world and enjoyed it,” Drummond told People in 2019. “It was a good exercise.”    A post shared by Ree Drummond - Pioneer Woman (@thepioneerwoman) But she eventually “settled back into a more sustainable, realistic way of eating.” Her experience did, however, influence her 2019 cookbook, The New Frontier, which is packed with “suggestions for how to lighten up an otherwise really carb-heavy dish.” “More than any cookbook before this one, this really reflects my life in terms of what I’m eating,” she said. “Some days I’m like, ‘You know what? I’m going to use spaghetti squash instead of pasta,’ and the next day I eat, like, a big lasagna roll up with creamy shrimp scampi.” You Might Also Like 60+ Grilling Recipes for an Epic Summer Cookout The Best Reese Witherspoon Movies, Ranked 70 Impressive Tiny Houses That Maximize Function and Style",Health/Country Living,"Ree Drummond, 52, Says ""Small"" Lifestyle Changes Helped Her Lose Nearly 60 Pounds",https://news.yahoo.com/ree-drummond-52-says-small-160000066.html

Contact a qualified medical professional before engaging in any physical activity, or making any changes to your diet, medication or lifestyle. Forgetting where you put something or a failing to recall a person’s name can happen to anyone. However it becomes much more distressing when frequent memory loss begins to affect our daily lives and in some cases, can eventually cause us to lose our independence. While impaired memory could be the result of infection, depression or anxiety or other medical conditions, it may also be due to dementia.  Impaired memory loss may be due to dementia, which impacts more than half a million Canadians and is expected to nearly double by 2030, according to the Alzheimer Society of Canada.  Dementia is not a disease, but a general term used to refer to disorders that cause progressive loss of cognitive functioning, which means it affects your way of thinking, remembering and reasoning. Many people who are diagnosed with dementia can also experience changes in their mood and personality. More than 500,000 Canadians live with dementia or Alzheimer's disease (a form of dementia). As our population ages, experts project the number of people living with some from of dementia to be as high as 930,000 by 2030.  Dementia results from a variety of diseases and injuries that primarily or secondarily affect the brain. Although they are often used interchangeably, Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia. According to the World Health Organization saying it contributes to 60-70% of dementia cases. Many people use the terms ""dementia"" and ""Alzheimer's"" interchangeably, but in reality Alzheimers is the cause and dementia is the effect. Stroke, head injuries and even Parkinson’s disease are also causes of dementia. According to experts, the most common symptom of dementia is short-term memory loss. This includes forgetting something that happened or was said within the last 10-15 minutes, repeating oneself and asking the same questions. Dr. Andrew Frank, a cognitive neurologist at the Bruyere Memory Program at Ottawa’s Elisabeth Bruyere Hospital, lists other symptoms as deterioration in language, words and judgement. The odd forgetfulness of a word or name that comes back to you later is normal, especially as we age or if we are stressed or sleep deprived. It’s when the memories are not coming back at all that's a signal of a much deeper problem. “One of the rules of thumb is that if you’re realizing your own memory problem, that’s a good sign because you’re remembering you’re forgetting,” Frank explains in an interview with Yahoo Canada. “It’s more serious if you are not realizing that you’re forgetting, meaning you’re forgetting that you’re forgetting and that can be a sign of something more serious like dementia.” If you notice a change in a family member's ability to recall information, repeating themselves, becoming confused, struggling with their vocabulary or completing tasks that would otherwise seem easy (like shopping or driving to a familiar location), consider accompanying them to an appointment with their family doctor as soon as possible. A doctor can perform memory tests and others to measure blood pressure and check levels of various chemicals, hormones and vitamins in the body. The family physician can refer the patient to a memory clinic as well, where more testing can be done to determine if the diagnosis is dementia. When it comes to dementia there are some risks that we can and can’t control. Factors that we can’t control that increase our risk of developing dementia are age (one in 20 Canadians over 65 have Alzheimer’s disease), genetics and sex; women have a greater chance of developing dementia than men.  The good news is that there are things we can control that can help minimize our risk of developing dementia. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and diet are both recommended. Making sure you’re physically active everyday is important and Frank insists exercising your brain is equally as crucial through hobbies and puzzles.  Eliminating smoking and excessive alcohol consumption while adhering to a wholesome diet like the Mediterranean diet can help keep your body and mind in shape. “Another strategy is to watch out for high blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes and to treat those because any factors that prevent heart attack and stroke will also prevent or delay dementia,” Franks says. While there is no cure for dementia, early detection can be beneficial with putting systems in place before these symptoms worsen. If someone is diagnosed at an earlier stage, they can begin memory treatments and take medications that can help manage the condition. Doctors also suggest putting home care and day programs in place as additional supports. ""Someone who has not been diagnosed may have a crisis of memory loss where they might be missing their medications or not eating due to forgetfulness which would then lead to a sudden health crisis and hospitalization,” Frank says.
