1/4/2022,"KANKAKEE, Ill. (AP) — A prosecutor said Monday he'll ask the Justice Department to review the case of two people charged in the shootings of two police officers at a northern Illinois hotel with the intention of pursuing federal death penalty charges. Illinois is not a death penalty state, but the U.S. Attorney General can authorize the filing of a petition to seek the death penalty in a federal murder case under certain circumstances, Kankakee County State’s Attorney Jim Rowe said during a bond hearing for Xandria Harris, 26, of Bradley in Kankakee County Circuit Court. “I will be submitting an official request to the U.S. Attorney General for the Central District of Illinois and to the U.S. Attorney General to review the first degree murder case pending against Darius Sullivan and Xandria Harris for federal murder charges, and pursue a federal sentence of death against both defendants,” Rowe said. Sullivan and Harris are charged with fatally shooting Bradley police Sgt. Marlene Rittmanic, 49, and critically wounding her partner, Officer Tyler Bailey, 27, late Wednesday. Bailey is hospitalized at a Chicago-area hospital. The State’s Attorney will also seek life sentences for both Sullivan and Harris as the existing state-level charges proceed, Rowe said. Judge Kathy Bradshaw Elliott granted a request to deny Harris bail. “You are a real threat to the community,” Elliott told Harris. Sullivan, 25, of Bourbonnais was arrested Friday at a home in North Manchester, Indiana, police said. The case will go before a Kankakee County grand jury on Jan. 22. The next court date for Harris is Jan. 27 when she will be arraigned. In Wabash, Indiana, meanwhile, Sullivan is fighting extradition to Illinois. Rowe said he will start the process of asking Indiana’s governor to sign a warrant to have Sullivan extradited to Kankakee County.",U.S./Associated Press,Prosecutor wants US death penalty for police shooting pair,https://news.yahoo.com/prosecutor-wants-us-death-penalty-234532330.html
1/4/2022,"Fox News and the rest of the right-wing media machine has been up in arms all day about Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s decision to spend New Year’s Eve in Miami, Florida. So when the channel’s afternoon host Sandra Smith kicked off a segment called “Rules for Thee, Not for Me,” she figured her guest would be on board the outrage train. “Well, it seems AOC is A-OK with ditching the mask, when in Miami at least,” Smith snarkily began, while showing footage of the New York Democrat “partying up” in what the host described as a “crowded bar” in Florida—while neglecting to acknowledge that it was outdoors under a tent. “Critics are calling her a hypocrite as COVID cases spike back in her home state of New York,” Smith continued, before posing that leading question to her guest, Fox Business Network correspondent—and occasional Trump critic—Charles Gasparino. “Is it fair that many are calling her out for being a hypocrite while partying it up in Florida while her home state is battling a record COVID surge?” Stephen Colbert Destroys Fox News’ Laura Ingraham Over Capitol Riot Texts His answer seemed to take her by surprise. “To be honest with you, no!” Gasparino said. “It is unfair. I don’t see why she can’t go to Florida and have a good time.” “Nobody said she can’t,” Smith pushed back, defensively. “They’re just questioning the hypocrisy.” Gasparino went on to say that it could be considered hypocritical if Ocasio-Cortez was attacking Florida’s Governor Ron DeSantis while giving her own state’s leaders a pass. But more to the point, he added, “This is a Fox News alert. I am going to support AOC on this. And here’s why: She was outside!” Unless Ocasio-Cortez has said that people should wear masks at all times even when eating outside, “then it’s not hypocritical,” he concluded, much to the host’s disappointment.
