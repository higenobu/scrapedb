How to qualify for the student loan tax offset hardship refund “Vacation pro tip: Avoid the pool with the swim-up bar,” TikTok user @twofoodpiggies advised in the video. “There were literally intoxicated guests admitting that they were peeing in the pool here.” The video shows people hanging out at the swim-up bar at a resort in Cabo, Mexico, according to the tags included on TikTok. “One girl didn’t understand why some people were leaving the pool to use the washroom,” @twofoodpiggies alleged in the video’s caption. This Brooklyn home office gets a California-inspired makeover with just $1,000: In 2019, the CDC even issued a plea for people to stop peeing in pools after the Sachs Media Group conducted an online survey that found out that 40% of the 3,100 Americans interviewed admitted to peeing in pools. Pools are filled with chlorine to protect swimmers from germs and outbreaks. When someone pees in the pool, it decreases chlorine’s effectiveness and can contribute to skin irritation and respiratory symptoms. Over 2,000 people chimed in on @twofoodpiggies’s video — with some identifying as former competitive swimmers or water polo players and claiming this wasn’t that gross to them. “As a collegiate swimmer, I promise we all peed in the pool every day,” one person said. “I don’t even go in the swim-up pool [I] just watch how long some people stay in the water,” another added. “They all do [it].” “The amount of people admitting peeing in a pool in this comment section disgusts me,” a top comment says.

The Ukrainian Defense Ministry tweeted that its forces were ""ruining the holiday for the occupiers."" Every year, Russia celebrates Victory Day with a grand military parade in Moscow's Red Square. Ukraine's government mocked Russia's celebration of ""Victory Day"" by holding what it said was a ""parade"" of tanks that Ukrainian forces captured from Russian troops amid Moscow's war with the eastern European country. The Ukrainian Defense Ministry said in a tweet on Wednesday that the Ukrainian military's 93rd Mechanized Brigade ""held a parade of trophy Russian tanks, ruining the holiday for the occupiers,"" in reference to Victory Day. ""Maybe aggressors think that by arming #UAarmy with Russian trophy equipment, it will affect the turn of NATO-style armament? New clever plan,"" the Ukrainian Defense Ministry taunted in the tweet. —Defence of Ukraine (@DefenceU) May 9, 2022 Russia's annual Victory Day, held on May 9, commemorates the Soviet Union's defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. Every year, Russia marks the occasion with a grand military parade in Moscow's Red Square. This year, Russian President Vladimir Putin's Victory Day speech passed without a single direct mention of Ukraine or a declaration of all-out war, despite Western officials' warnings that Putin may escalate the conflict around the holiday. In his speech, Putin ripped NATO expansion, accused the US of aggression, and called Ukraine and its leaders Nazis — claims he previously used to justify the Russian invasion of Ukraine. When Putin announced his invasion of Ukraine, he said he was seeking the ""denazification"" of Ukraine, a country whose democratically elected leader, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is Jewish. ""The West was preparing for the invasion of Russia. NATO was creating tensions at the borders. They did not want to listen to Russia. They had other plans,"" Putin said in his Victory Day speech. ""You are fighting for the motherland, for its future, so that no one forgets the lessons of World War II, so that there is no place in the world for executioners, punishers, and Nazis."" Russia launched its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine on February 24 and the war has since left thousands dead on both sides, including many Ukrainian civilians. In recent weeks, Russia has focused its attacks in Ukraine on the eastern Donbas region after Russian troops failed to take the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv.

5/10/2022,"INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — An associate of Jared Fogle who provided evidence that led to the criminal case against the disgraced former Subway pitchman was sentenced Monday to 27 years in prison for sexually molesting young girls and installing cameras to secretly take videos and photos of the victims. A federal judge sentenced Russell Taylor, 50, who pleaded guilty last year to 30 child pornography and sexual exploitation crimes for his acts against nine children, The Indianapolis Star reported. The victims were ages 9 to 16 when the crimes occurred. Two of the girls were molested by Taylor and his wife, Angela Baldwin, who was convicted in 2020 of four child exploitation and child pornography crimes. She is scheduled to be sentenced later Monday. The couple shared videos and photos of the girls with Fogle that were captured by hidden cameras Taylor installed in the couple's Indianapolis home. Fogle, who became a Subway pitchman after shedding more than 200 pounds (90.7 kilograms) as a college student, in part by eating the chain’s sandwiches, was sentenced in 2015 to 15 years in prison for possession or distribution of child pornography and traveling across state lines to have sex with a minor. Taylor was executive director of the Jared Foundation, a nonprofit that Fogle started to raise awareness and money to fight childhood obesity. He provided evidence that led to the criminal case against Fogle, his one-time boss and close friend. Taylor was originally sentenced in 2015, but U.S. District Judge Tanya Walton Pratt in 2020 found that he had received ineffective legal assistance because his lawyer had failed to challenge three criminal charges against him for which there was no factual basis. Taylor’s attorneys asked Pratt to sentence him to 19 years, while prosecutors sought a prison sentence of 35 years. Pratt gave him a lesser sentence because he provided important information to federal law enforcement that helped them bring charges against Baldwin and Fogle. During Monday's sentencing hearing, Pratt described the four-year grooming, exploitation and molestation of the children from 2011-2015 as a “mutual perversion” between Taylor, Baldwin and Fogle. Taylor told the court Monday that he was a “vile, selfish, self-loathing, sorry excuse” for a human, but that time in prison had changed him. He said he had taken advantage of a sex offender rehabilitation class while incarcerated. Federal prosecutor Kathryn Olivier read statements during Taylor’s sentencing from some of the victims — some of whom are Taylor and Baldwin’s relatives — who said they expect to need mental health help and medication for the rest of their lives. One victim said she checks for cameras anytime she’s in the bathroom at a house that isn’t hers.",U.S./Associated Press,Judge sentences Jared Fogle associate to 27 years in prison,https://news.yahoo.com/judge-sentences-jared-fogle-associate-185637988.html
