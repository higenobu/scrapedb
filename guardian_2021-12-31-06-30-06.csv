12/31/2021,"After decades of fossil hunting in their spare time (he wooed her with two halves of an ancient beast’s vertebrae; they cut their wedding cake with a Neanderthal handaxe they had unearthed together), Sally and Neville Hollingworth made the discovery of a lifetime at the bottom of a quarry in Cerney Wick. It was a collection of mammoth bones of a size, state and number more usually found in Siberia than Swindon, left in the wake of the Thames’ ancient wanderings and dating from more than 200,000 years ago. While we wait impatiently for the 90-minute British romcom to be written by Frank Cottrell Boyce, starring Olivia Colman as Sally and Martin Freeman as Neville, as must surely come to pass, we have an equally endearing documentary about the fossil find itself. Attenborough and the Mammoth Graveyard (BBC One) opens with Sir David visiting the Hollingworths at their neat suburban home. Every wall is lined with shelves and cases housing immaculately presented fossils they have found. The mammoth bones are on the kitchen table. Attenborough floats through in a trance of delight. “It’s a great thrill, isn’t it?” the world’s most revered naturalist murmurs reverently, as he lays hands on a giant ice age humerus. “The whole of this business.”  It is a stroke of genius to put such a documentary on at Christmas. Prehistory is the greatest story yet untold, and the sight of passionate experts gleaning more of it from fragments of snail shell, sediment samples, notches on preserved shin bones and scapulae, then putting new scraps of the tale together, sends a shiver down the secular spine. It is the closest we spiritually impoverished lot will come to religious awe, but I wouldn’t trade it. Evolutionary biology professor Ben Garrod is the on-site missionary and co-presenter here, now that Attenborough at 95 is forced to take things a little easier. He does most of the interviews with the people pulling miracles from the mud then performing more of their own back in the lab. Generations of Siberians thought the buried remains they occasionally came across were evidence that huge, underground burrowing creatures once owned the tundra. Seventeenth-century Europeans thought theirs were evidence of giants or unicorns. Then in 1864 a piece of mammoth ivory was discovered in France with such a detailed engraving of the animal on it that it has been considered proof that humans lived alongside these elephant-like beasts and that unicorns, alas, didn’t really enter into it (nor giant burrowing creatures, which seems even more of a shame). Now, of course, we have people who can test the radioactivity of quartz grains, pull apart layers of rock and sediment like tissue paper, and consult a secure facility full of prehistoric knapped flints to tell you what was happening when Britain wasn’t yet an island, glaciers were retreating across a tiny patch of Wiltshire and megafauna were still roaming the Earth. As with most BBC documentaries involving natural history (and especially if they also involve Attenborough), it manages the graceful feat of sticking to the facts while still incorporating the sense of mystery that helps create the fascination. We are led to the answers of exactly what species of mammoth are resting at the bottom of the former river (steppe and woolly – I didn’t even know there were different kinds, although I know several 10-year-old boys who would howl at my ignorance), how so many animals came to die at the same place, and whether Neanderthal man could bring down large beasts from a distance or only at close quarters. We are led there via moments of marvelling at the skill needed to create weapons and tools out of stone, and the possibilities represented by a Levallois flake. Prof Garrod wonders, given his understanding of the behaviour of elephants, mammoths’ descendants, whether a juvenile had become stuck in the mud, the herd had panicked and nearby Neanderthals had taken advantage of the chance to avail themselves of weeks and weeks of food. Possibly. Maybe probably. Whatever the truth, it was a salutary reminder in these violently argumentative, polarised times that it’s OK to theorise. It’s OK to entertain options. It’s all right not to know. A great thrill, anyway. The whole of this business.

12/31/2021,"Boris Johnson is reportedly due to be cleared of breaking the ministerial code over payments for his Downing Street flat refurbishment after an independent adviser looked into whether he had been misled during an initial investigation. Lord Geidt led an inquiry that cleared the prime minister of wrongdoing in May, but is understood to have looked into a discrepancy between the findings in his report and another into the same matter published earlier this month by the Electoral Commission.  The issue centred on claims a Tory peer footed the bill for refurbishments to the No 11 flat. In his first set of findings, Geidt, the adviser on ministerial interests, said Johnson told him “he knew nothing about such payments” until immediately prior to media reports in February 2021. However the Electoral Commission’s own investigation said it had seen a WhatsApp message showing Johnson had been in direct contact with the donor, Lord Brownlow, in November 2020 about the flat refurbishment. Brownlow made a £58,000 donation to the Conservatives but the Electoral Commission found it was not declared properly and fined the party £17,800. According to the Financial Times, Geidt sought an explanation from Johnson and exchanged several letters with the prime minister that could be published in the new year. The newspaper also said Johnson’s behaviour was to be “criticised” and that Geidt had described the situation to colleagues as “deeply unsatisfactory” but would not change his ruling that Johnson had not broken the ministerial code. The result of the inquiry has been closely watched, given it could prompt the launching of another inquiry by the parliamentary standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, into whether Johnson broke the MPs’ code of conduct. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “We do not comment on speculation.” They also pointed to the terms of reference of Geidt’s inquiry, which said the advice Geidt gives to Johnson “will be published in a timely manner”. Asked previously if Johnson had lied to Geidt, the prime minister’s spokesperson said: “No.”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson ‘to be cleared of breaking ministerial code’ over No 10 refurb,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/30/boris-johnson-to-be-cleared-of-breaking-ministerial-code-over-no-10-refurb
12/31/2021,"Confirmed daily Covid cases in the UK hit yet another high on Thursday, with 189,213 reported in the past 24 hours, while the number of people in hospital and deaths have also risen, data reveals. On Wednesday 183,037 daily cases were reported for the whole of the UK – a record at the time – although this figure included a backlog in some nations from before and during the Christmas period, with five days of case data included for Northern Ireland. Thursday’s newly reported cases for Wales covered a two-day period.  But experts have warned daily case figures do not include reinfections and not everyone who is infected has symptoms and takes a test, meaning despite cases reaching new highs the true number of infections will be higher still. The latest data also reveals a rise of 332 in the number of people who have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test. The figures are a steep rise on the 57 deaths reported on Wednesday. Experts say the jump is, in part, because NHS England has not reported hospital deaths since 24 December. The number of Covid patients in hospital has also increased in England, according to the latest data, with 11,452 reported on Thursday. In Scotland, it was announced on Thursday that there were 810 patients in hospital with recently confirmed Covid, an increase of 19.3% compared with the day before. Commenting on Twitter, Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said the record case figures reflect that Omicron is highly infectious. “Just as notable than cases is the steep rise in hospital occupancy, the largest single day increase in a while – a reminder that even if there is a lower percentage hospitalised through Omicron, sheer volume will still put acute pressure on NHS – and result in serious illness for many,” she wrote, adding that she was “appealing to everyone” to follow public health advice as the new year approached. In a written statement Mark Drakeford, the first minister of Wales, said that the public health situation in Wales “has deteriorated in the last week as the Omicron wave has arrived”, adding that while hospitalisations are lower than in previous waves, they are also are starting to increase. According to the latest figures the number of Covid patients in hospital in Wales is now 446, a 49% increase compared with last week. However, Drakeford said Wales was not reporting a rise in the number of Covid patients needing critical care. Prof Christina Pagel, director of UCL’s Clinical Operational Research Unit, said that reported case levels in England are now more than twice as high as the previous peak last January, and have not yet peaked, while cases are rising in all groups apart from under-10s. Hospital admissions, she added, are also rising in all age groups. While data suggested fewer admissions are leading to intensive care, Pagel said the situation was worrying. “An NHS crisis based on the wards instead of ICU is still an NHS crisis,” she tweeted.",News/World news,"UK Covid case numbers hit another record high at more than 189,000",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/30/uk-covid-case-numbers-hit-another-record-high-at-more-than-189000
