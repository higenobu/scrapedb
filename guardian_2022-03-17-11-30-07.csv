3/17/2022,"Barnaby Joyce has earmarked close to $500m to build the Urannah Dam in central Queensland, despite the project not yet securing environmental approvals and several studies suggesting the idea is not economically viable. The proposal, long championed by the Queensland Nationals, has been around since the 1960s and a number of feasibility studies have queried the viability of the project. Environment groups said it was a commercial “white elephant” and there were legitimate concerns it could wipe out the remaining habitat of a rare freshwater turtle named after the late conservationist Steve Irwin. The Morrison government has allocated more than $22m to cover costs associated with developing a business case and assessing the regulatory requirements. The water storage would aid agricultural production and also assist expansion of the coal industry in central Queensland. The federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, told the ABC on Thursday the project had already been declared a controlled action under national environmental law and would go through “a staged assessment process” which would first be considered by the Queensland government, then federally. Ley insisted the central Queensland proposal would face the same scrutiny as any other project in Australia. She said the approval would consider the impact of the proposal on threatened species and world heritage places close to the dam: “All of the steps will be taken. There is no stepping outside national environmental law on this or any other project. “As a member of the Morrison government I make no apology for wanting to have infrastructure projects that balance the needs of communities, the environment, industry and our future,” she said. When asked whether she could guarantee the project represented value for money for taxpayers given the project had been on the drawing board since the 1960s and the focus of more than 25 feasibility studies, Ley said: “That’s not a guarantee I can give on this program … I suggest you talk to the proponents.” Asked whether the government was prepared to abandon the dam if assessment showed it failed to stack up environmentally or economically, Ley said: “We’ll take it one step at a time.” The project proponent, Bowen River Utilities, is run by John Cotter Jr, a former member of the Liberal National party executive. Guardian Australia makes no suggestion Bowen River Utilities or any associated individual has acted improperly, or that the company and its proposal should not be eligible to receive federal grant funding.

At the time, the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, said it was a “significant step forward in delivering water security for the Broken River Valley” and Queensland’s water minister, Glenn Butcher, said funding tied to the agreement would enable the proponent “to progress its business case and other early investigations into the project”. The Australian Conservation Foundation’s Gavan McFadzean said several studies had concluded the dam would leave a huge cost burden to taxpayers, making it a likely “white elephant”. He said it would have a devastating impact on the ecology of the Burdekin and Bowen river systems, and there were legitimate concerns it would destroy the only habitat used by the Irwin turtle, discovered by Steve Irwin and his father, Bob, in 1990, which made headlines for breathing through its bottom. Scientists believe there may be fewer than 5,000 Irwin turtles left. McFadzean said the water from the dam would be used to service coal mining, not farmers, and traditional owners had raised fears the project would inundate areas of high cultural significance. “The Urannah Dam proposal is a relic from last century,” he said. “It would be bad for wildlife, for water supply, for heritage and for the climate.” Tim Beshara, the policy and strategy manager with the Wilderness Society, said the dam announcement was “just more performative policymaking”. “It’s half-a-billion in marginal seat virtue signalling for a project that doesn’t even have its environmental approvals yet,” he said. “It seems like we again entered another period of chest-thumping, chainsaw-starting, anti-environmental policy announcements from the Morrison government.” Ley defended an announcement this week that the Morrison government would introduce 10 regional plans under national environment law that would remove the need for developments in some areas to receive project-specific approval. Conservationists fear the change could weaken nature protection. The minister said suggestions environmental protection would be reduced showed a misunderstanding of the bioregional planning approach. “To suggest a bioregional plan is avoiding the [Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation] Act is completely wrong,” she said. Asked how the government could make it faster and easier for resources projects to be approved while also safeguarding the environment, Ley said the two elements were not mutually exclusive. “They can be at odds, but they don’t need to be at odds – that’s the point,” she said. Dam proposals in other parts of the country have proved costly and environmentally controversial. In New South Wales, two projects, the Mole River Dam and the Wyangala Dam expansion, have been put on hold due to costs. A third, the Dungowan Dam near Tamworth, is moving ahead despite being described as flawed by the Productivity Commission. The NSW government’s proposal to raise the Warragamaba Dam wall in Sydney’s west has been met with wide-ranging concerns, including from NSW officials, about its impacts on environmental and cultural heritage.",News/Australia news,Barnaby Joyce tags $500m for Queensland dam despite lack of environmental approvals,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/17/barnaby-joyce-tags-500m-for-queensland-dam-despite-lack-of-environmental-approvals
3/17/2022,"Stuart Robert has said independent schools do not accept “dud teachers”, sending the “bottom 10% of teachers dragging the chain” into the government system, where they are protected from being fired. The acting education minister made the remarks at an independent schools conference on Thursday, revealing the federal government will aim to lift teacher standards by revamping course content and bringing forward the initial literacy and numeracy test for teachers. Robert also said the Morrison government was prepared to delay approving the new proposed school curriculum until Australia’s “Christian heritage” was reinserted and “nuts” tasks such as year two students “identifying racist statues” were removed. Robert noted that Australia’s Programme for International Student Assessment test results have slipped in the past 20 years, from fourth to 16th in reading, eighth to 17th in science and 11th the 29th in maths. Robert is filling in for Alan Tudge, who opted to stay on the backbench after an investigation found there was insufficient evidence he breached ministerial standards. Robert accepted the decline had occurred across the board, but also singled-out independent schools for praise, suggesting the government wanted to bottle their success and “take it across the country”. Although there were no “silver bullets”, Robert said, teacher quality came “screaming out” as the most important fix, as studies showed that bringing the bottom 10% of teachers up to the standard of the average would reverse the decline. “Now, I don’t think that’s a problem in your schools, because frankly you can hire and fire your own teachers,” he told the Independent Schools Australia and Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia national education forum. Referring to the principal of his alma mater, Rockhampton grammar, Robert said there was “no way … Dr Moulds would accept a dud teacher in his school, like, for a second”. “So for your school you just don’t have them – you don’t have the bottom 10% of teachers dragging the chain,” he said. “But for every teacher you don’t have in your organisation, guess where they go?” Robert said Australia must “face the brutal reality” and “stop pussyfooting around the fact that the problem is the protection of teachers who don’t want to be there, who aren’t up to the right standard”. Robert said there were teachers who graduated from university who “can’t read and write”, evidenced by the fact they could not pass the Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education Students (Lantite). Robert said the government could not accept the current rates of 10% of teachers failing the Lantite in the third and fourth year of their education degree, arguing the test “needs to come forward” to the first week of the first year of the degree. “If you can’t perform in basic literacy and numeracy, how can you teach children?” he said. On the proposed new curriculum, Robert said the government “will not approve it” until it is satisfied with changes aimed at decluttering and making it more rigorous. Robert said the maths curriculum should have fewer instructions to “inquire” into topics and more requirements to “master” topics, such as times tables. Robert, who is also the employment minister, said he was on a site in Hobart that was able to hire only four apprentices when it wanted eight, because other candidates “didn’t have year 11 mathematics” and you can’t work in the trades “if you can’t measure stuff”. “So there’s four young Australians who didn’t get a job because no one taught them mathematics in year 11,” he said. “Trust me, they didn’t come from your schools. You and I are on a unity ticket on this.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Robert called for a “more balanced view of Australian history”, arguing that Australia should be proud of its Indigenous history, western liberal and democratic heritage tradition and recent migration. “It’s essential that students appreciate each one of them. The idea that a draft was presented to me that ostensibly removed the entire Christian heritage of our nation is unacceptable.” “I don’t want to teach students in year two to identify racist statues. Are you kidding me? That’s nuts.” Robert said revisions were “travelling very well” and there would be further talks in April, with the commonwealth and Western Australia yet to agree to the new curriculum.",News/Australia news,Stuart Robert says ‘dud teachers’ not an issue in Australia’s independent schools,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/17/stuart-robert-says-dud-teachers-not-an-issue-in-australias-independent-schools
3/17/2022,"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe has touched down on British soil for the first time since she was detained in Iran six years ago. Wearing a blue dress and a yellow scarf, the colours of Ukraine, Zaghari-Ratcliffe stepped off a government-chartered flight from Oman at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire in the early hours of Thursday morning. Alongside 44-year-old Zaghari-Ratcliffe as she disembarked was fellow British-Iranian Anoosheh Ashoori, 67, who was also released from jail in Iran on Wednesday. They walked across the tarmac together, gesturing to photographers, before entering the airport building for a private reunion with their families. Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband, Richard, who has campaigned for years for her release, was waiting inside with their seven-year-old daughter Gabriella. Ashoori’s daughter Elika, was among those waiting for the 67-year-old businessman. Liz Truss, the British foreign secretary, was watching on from the airport building as the pair arrived and tweeted that she was “delighted” that Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Ashoori had returned to the UK. Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Ashoori, who was detained in Evin prison for almost five years, were accused of plotting to overthrow the Iranian government and of spying respectively. A third British detainee, Morad Tahbaz, has been released from prison on furlough but remains in Iran. All three deny the charges. Truss said on Thursday morning that the government would “continue to work intensively’’ for the freedom of Tahbaz. The UK is understood to have agreed to pay £393.8m owed to Iran after it cancelled an order of Chieftain tanks following the overthrow of the Shah in the revolution of 1979. The details of the deal were hammered out in secret talks in February largely in Oman between a British Foreign Office team and the Iranians. With trust between the two countries at a low point, every aspect of the deal, including its choreography, had to be agreed. Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Ashoori were initially taken to the Gulf state of Oman, which has been closely involved in the behind-the-scenes negotiations to secure their freedom. Earlier, Boris Johnson thanked the Omani government for its help in bringing the pair home. Speaking on a visit to Saudi Arabia, the prime minister said: “It is fantastic news that Nazanin is out. I am thrilled also for Anoosheh Ashoori and Morad Tahbaz who are also out. “It has been a lot of work by a lot of people. I want to pay particular tribute to her husband Richard. It is fantastic that she will be able to come back, see her family, see her daughter Gabriella.” Alongside the 44-year-old Zaghari-Ratcliffe,44, was detained on security charges by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard at Imam Khomeini airport after a holiday visit to Iran, where she introduced her daughter Gabriella to her parents. Ashoori was arrested in August 2017 while visiting his elderly mother in Tehran. In the Commons, with Ratcliffe and Gabriella, seven, watching, Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, set out details of their release. “It was only when we heard that the wheels were up in Tehran that we really knew it was happening,” she said. Tulip Siddiq, who is Ratcliffe’s MP, told ITV’s Peston programme about how Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been able to come home. The Labour MP said: “She was contacted by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards in Iran over the weekend and asked to come in for questioning, and quite apprehensive – she messaged me before she went. To her utter surprise, at the end of the questioning, and there were some scare tactics in there, she was given her British passport back. “Bearing in mind she hasn’t seen her British passport since the 23 April 2016. But just as she was about to leave the door, they said to her, ‘don’t book your own flight, we will sort out the flights for you’. “So after that, I had an idea that she would be coming back, but it’s always touch and go with these things - we’ve had so many false dawns, I didn’t know for sure. “But the minute she was at the airport, I had a message from Richard Ratcliffe saying Nazanin is at the airport and to her surprise Anoosheh was there as well, who was the other detainee, (a) British citizen. We didn’t think he was coming home, because he wasn’t under house arrest, he was actually in Evin prison.” The former prime minister David Cameron, who was in No 10 when Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained in Iran, told Channel 4 News her release was “a piece of good news that we’ve all been waiting to hear for so long”. Iran is treating Tabhaz, 66, as an American citizen, even though he was born in Hammersmith, west London, and holds US, UK and Iranian citizenship. Disagreements over his fate proved an obstacle to a deal in the past. The Tahbaz family told the Guardian: “We have been let down and betrayed by the British government. He was the only one of the three with a British birth certificate, and he has been left behind. We were not told about this arrangement except in a short phone call with the foreign secretary, when it was too late to do anything about it. The British now just say he is an American problem.”",News/News,Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe returns to the UK after six-year ordeal ,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/mar/17/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-anoosheh-ashoori-returns-uk-six-years-iran-prison
3/17/2022,"Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, suggested talks were making progress despite continued bloodshed and fears from some EU leaders that the Kremlin was toying with Kyiv. Lavrov told RBC News” “There is some hope of reaching a compromise … “Neutral status is now being seriously discussed seriously along, of course, with security guarantees.” A report by the Financial Times about a proposed 15-point peace plan between Moscow and Kyiv shows only “the requesting position of the Russian side”, Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said. The FT had reported a “tentative” peace plan that included a ceasefire and Russian withdrawal if Kyiv declares neutrality and accepts limits on its armed forces. Russian forces bombed a theatre and swimming pool complex where civilians were sheltering in the encircled Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, officials said. Mariupol council posted an image of the city’s theatre showing it sustained heavy damage in today’s attack and said casualty numbers were being confirmed. Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of Donetsk regional administration, said that pregnant women and children were sheltering at the pool, calling the attack “pure terrorism”. The word “children” had been written outside the theatre. Zelenskiy said “our hearts are broken” by the strike, and likened the siege of the city to that of Leningrad in the second world war. Joe Biden referred to Vladimir Putin as a “war criminal”, his sharpest rebuke yet of the Russian president, after he announced an extra $800m in security assistance to Ukraine, to buy more weapons and military equipment. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Biden’s comments were “unacceptable and unforgivable rhetoric”, according to Russia’s state-owned Tass news agency. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on the US Congress to provide more weapons to help his country fight off Russian airstrikes and for further sanctions against Russia, including the withdrawal of all US businesses. Russian forces shot and killed 10 people standing for bread in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, the US embassy in Kyiv said. Ukrainian officials said the attack took place at 10am local time (8am GMT). Russia’s defence ministry denied the report, claiming no Russian soldiers were in Chernihiv. The UN security council will meet Thursday at the request of six western nations that sought an open session on Ukraine. The UK’s UN mission tweeted: “Russia is committing war crimes and targeting civilians. Russia’s illegal war on Ukraine is a threat to us all.” The meeting comes ahead of an expected vote on a Russian humanitarian resolution that has been sharply criticised for making no mention of Moscow’s war against Ukraine. Russian forces have released the mayor of the Ukrainian city of Melitopol, the Ukrainian president said. Ukraine’s state services for communications shared a video showing Zelenskiy speaking to Ivan Fedorov following his release. The president said Fedorov was abducted by Russian forces on 11 March who tried to persuade him to collaborate but “our man withstood. He did not give up.” The bodies of five people, including three children, have been recovered during searches of shelled residential buildings in the northern city of Chernihiv, Ukraine’s emergencies service said. The bodies were found in the ruins of a dormitory building, it said in an online statement. The UN’s international court of justice (ICJ) has ordered Russia to stop its invasion, saying it had not seen any evidence to support the Kremlin’s justification for the war. Only the Russian and Chinese judges on the court voted against the order. Putin, said the west “would not succeed” in what he called its attempt to achieve global dominance and dismember Russia. In a televised speech to government ministers, Putin went further than before in acknowledging the pain that western sanctions were inflicting on the Russian economy, but insisted the country could withstand the blow. There have been 43 attacks on Ukrainian healthcare facilities, infrastructure and workers since the beginning of the invasion, said WHO chief, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Two health workers had been killed and at least eight injured in the attacks, the WHO said. The prima ballerina Olga Smirnova, one of Russia’s biggest dance stars, has quit the Bolshoi Ballet company in Moscow after denouncing the Russian invasion. Earlier this month, Smirnova posted on Telegram saying that she was against the war “with all the fibres of my soul”.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 22 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-22-of-the-invasion
3/17/2022,"The beaming smile of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe features on the front pages of the national papers on Thursday after she was freed following six years imprisoned in Iran. With the war in Ukraine relegated to the second spot for the first time in three weeks, the Times splash headline says: “Free at last, Nazanin will ‘learn to be happy again’” alongside a picture of her on the plane out of Iran. The same picture dominates the front page of the Guardian as well, under the headline “Zaghari-Ratcliffe released after six years in Iran jail”. The paper also carries the background about how the deal was achieved, along with analysis that asks why it took so long to pay the reported £400m debt if that was what was required for Zaghari Ratcliffe’s freedom. The paper reported that British-Iranian Anoosheh Ashoori, a 68-year-old retired civil engineer who was arrested in Tehran in 2017, was also released and was set to return to his family in the UK. The Mirror goes with the domestic angle inspired by Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s husband, Richard, saying that “after six years in hell” she was most looking forward to sitting down and having a cup of tea and seeing her seven-year-old daughter Gabriella: “Home … for a nice cuppa”. The Telegraph’s main headline is “‘Mummy really is coming home’”, taking the words of Labour MP for Hampstead, Tulip Sidiq, as she spoke in the Commons as Richard and Gabriella looked on from the public gallery. The Mail also likes the family line and has the splash headline “Mummy’s home at last!”, reporting that the Iranian-born project manager was looking forward to an “emotional reunion” with her family after her “six-year jail hell”. The Express speaks to the picture of Zaghari-Ratcliffe with the headline “Smile that says: I’m free”. The i has the same trick but a very slightly different wording “Smile that says she’s free”, although its main story is “Russia bombs theatre being used as shelter”. The Financial Times also carries the picture and the headline “Zaghari-Ratcliffe released from Iran after UK pays $530m debt”. But it too leads on Ukraine with “Moscow and Kyiv explore neutrality plan in peace talks”.

3/17/2022,"Most post-match press conferences are a complete waste of time. The coach rocks up, the journalists lob a few half volleys, the sponsors get a bit of exposure, and very little is gleaned. In recent years, coaches like Chris Scott and John Worsfold have gone to great lengths to say as little as possible. Luke Beveridge has always been different. He generally provides thoughtful answers. Like Ross Lyon, he treats idiotic questions with the contempt they deserve. He wears his heart on his sleeve, and he has certainly always been a little bit different to most AFL coaches. For the most part, it’s what’s made him one of the more interesting, likeable and successful coaches. In recent weeks, he delivered a rambling, often incomprehensible season launch speech in which he channelled the spirit of Che Guevura, calling for a “revolution” to rebuild the club’s fortunes. That’s just Bevo, we thought – a bit bonkers, always looking for an angle. But as 100,000 Russian troops were massed on the Ukraine border, is was another example of footy taking itself a bit too seriously. Besides, the constant “siege mentality” was starting to wear thin. It’s all very well pushing the “us against the world” mentality when you’re coaching a bunch of scrubbers. Beveridge has some of the best footballers in Australia at his disposal. His club is going well on and off the field. It all seemed a little hackneyed. On Wednesday night, he came spoiling for a fight. His team had been rolled. His sergeant-in-arms moustache was bristling. He had an axe to grind with Tom Morris after the journalist published a story on Monday saying that Lachie Hunter wouldn’t be selected for the match. Beveridge unleashed a rather extraordinary tirade, accusing him of “gutter journalism”. “You’ve been preying on us. You’ve been opening us up, causing turmoil within our football club.” He stormed out. It certainly made for good content. But it was pretty churlish, excruciating stuff. Morris, to his credit, stood his ground. His story held up – Hunter was initially named to start, then moved to the medical substitute list but ended up playing after an injury in the warm-up. Over the years, some in the AFL have bullied and berated journalists. They’re often young, often fighting out of their weight division and often caught like a deer in the headlights. Coaches would do it to deflect attention away from their own shortcomings. Some would often do it to protect their own players. Over the years, the questions got softer and softer. In the end, you had some journalists lobbing free hits at experienced and wily couches, who’d gently pat them away. It was hardly Frost-Nixon. Wednesday night felt different. Wednesday night Beveridge crossed a line and it’s worth asking why. Coaching departments are certainly under a lot of strain at the moment. They’re under-resourced and overworked. Chris Scott has spoken at length about how it really isn’t an enjoyable or healthy way to make a living. In his exit from the Adelaide Crows, Don Pyke expressed concerns around “contentment” and how the pitiless scrutiny is breaking a lot of coaches down. In this context, Beveridge’s comments about gutter journalism have weight. Look at some the reporting around the break-ups of the marriages of Damian Hardwick and Nathan Buckley, and tell me that isn’t gutter journalism. Look at the markets that are framed around the first coach to be sacked. Look at a lot of language we use to describe losses. In the Herald Sun recently, Mark Robinson described North Melbourne losing a scratch match as “revolting, physically weak, mentally soft, humbled, shamed, bashed, and bruised”. If I were a footy coach, and I read that, I’d have a sizeable chip on my shoulder too. Morris’s story didn’t fall into any of these categories, but they are indicative of the pressure on coaches. Beveridge has always been a man you cross at your peril. He has long standing feuds with several prominent footy figures, including Kane Cornes and Damian Barrett. When one of his players was said to have passed on sensitive information about team selection to his brother, Beveridge was apoplectic. He called it an act of “high treason”. In Martin Flanagan’s book about the 2016 premiership, the Bulldogs head trainer told him Beveridge is “the nicest person at the club” “But you wouldn’t want to cross him on an issue where he felt the integrity of the club or the team were concerned.” That’s all well and good. He’s a players’ man. He’s an emotional man. And he’s a street fighter. But he was dying on the wrong hill last night. He’s made an incredibly poor start to season 2022. Let’s hope, as Jack Dyer would say, he makes a better one next week.",Sport/Sport,Luke Beveridge crossed a line with ‘turmoil’ tirade after defeat in AFL opener | Jonathan Horn,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/17/luke-beveridge-crossed-a-line-with-turmoil-tirade-after-defeat-in-afl-opener
