3/30/2022,"Weeks after Russian soldiers took over the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in northern Ukraine, new reports reveal that the invading forces have engaged in reckless behavior at the facility beyond their initial shelling of it. The Chernobyl power plant, which suffered a reactor meltdown in 1986 that left dangerously high radiation levels in the area, was the site of one of the first face-to-face confrontations in the Ukraine War. Russian forces won that battle, taking control of the reactors and raising concerns throughout Europe about their stewardship of them. Recent reports show just how real those concerns were. While the Russian army has occupied the Chernobyl plant, Ukrainian workers remain stationed there and overseeing the site’s safety protocols. Around 200 employees were still at Chernobyl as of March 7, according to the BBC, where they have continued carrying out duties despite limited food and medical supplies. Chernobyl workers are usually rotated out regularly, but since the Russian occupation employees have had to endure dangerous weeks-long shifts. Two of these employees have reportedly witnessed instances of rash and dangerous conduct by the Russians, according to Reuters, with one source calling their behavior “suicidal.” Some soldiers had reportedly never heard about the disaster that some historians believe signaled the beginning of the end for the Soviet Union. Shortly after the occupation started, Ukrainian officials warned that radiation levels at Chernobyl were rising due to a large number of heavy military machines disturbing the topsoil around the area. These reports have now been confirmed by employees working at Chernobyl around the time of the invasion who observed “a big convoy of military vehicles” driving straight through zones so contaminated with radiation that even trained safety workers at Chernobyl are not allowed to venture there. Russian armored vehicles without radiation protection were seen driving through an area called the “Red Forest,” an area of woods four square miles in size surrounding the power plant. The area absorbed so much radiation from the Chernobyl explosion that its trees turned a gingery brown color, giving the forest its nickname. It is considered one of the world’s most radioactive places. The employees said that the military vehicles kicked up a “big column of dust,” which may be what sent radiation levels soaring in the area following the invasion. The workers believed that breathing in that much radioactive dust could cause radiation poisoning, which can quickly turn lethal. Valery Seida, the acting general of Chernobyl, has not been at the power plant since the invasion and could not verify the reports, but did confirm several witness accounts of recklessness by Russian soldiers who “drove wherever they needed to,” without heeding the warnings of plant safety officials. The Russian army has made occupying nuclear power plants a common practice during its campaign in Ukraine. Around a week after taking Chernobyl, Russian forces took over the Zaporizhzhia plant, Europe's largest nuclear plant, in southern Ukraine. Ukrainian and Western officials have said that keeping radiation levels at nuclear power plants contained is of paramount importance. In a nearly two-hour call earlier in March, French President Emmanuel Macron spent most of the conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin discussing safety protocols at Chernobyl and other nuclear power plants in Ukraine. Since being taken by Russian forces, Chernobyl has lost electrical power multiple times, which Ukrenergo, Ukraine’s electrical grid operator, has said could impair the plant’s safety and containment protocols. Ongoing military activity in the area surrounding Chernobyl has continued well into March. Last week, the International Atomic Energy Agency warned that Russian shelling near the plant was preventing workers from rotating their shifts after nearly weeks of continuous work, endangering the plant and its safety protocols.

3/30/2022,"Los Angeles County residents who are at least 50 years old can receive a second COVID-19 booster shot starting Wednesday, officials announced. The additional booster doses — which amount to a fourth shot for those who originally got the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, or a third jab for recipients of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine — are available to those who are at least four months removed from their initial booster. A number of sites countywide will open initially to accommodate those seeking a second booster, and other locations may soon be available as well. L.A. County is moving aggressively to offer the additional shots, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration only officially authorized Tuesday for those age 50 and older. The timeline in other counties was not immediately clear. Here's what we know: L.A. County health officials said second booster doses will be available starting Wednesday at the following locations: Eugene A. Obregon Park in East L.A. Ted Watkins Memorial Park in South L.A. Balboa Sports Complex in Encino Commerce Senior Citizens Center Market Street Center in Santa Clarita Palmdale Oasis Park Recreation Center Norwalk Arts and Sports Complex

 More information on these and other vaccination sites is available at VaccinateLACounty.com. Officials said the additional boosters might soon be available from other providers, such as pharmacies and doctor's offices, but those interested should check ahead. Many vaccine providers may be waiting a bit longer to provide the second booster to those age 50 and up. Generally, most vaccine providers have waited for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to officially weigh in on the FDA's decision and issue guidelines on who should get vaccinated. The CDC has not issued its statement on the FDA's decision as of midday Tuesday. Kaiser Permanente is one of those vaccine providers who are waiting for the CDC's input. ""As we have throughout the pandemic, when the Centers for Disease Control issues clinical guidance, Kaiser Permanente will administer second booster doses according to that guidance, and as soon as our systems and processes can be updated to safely administer these doses to the correct populations,"" Kaiser said in a statement. ""It is important to note that the FDA also reiterated that data show an initial booster dose is critical in helping to protect all adults from the potentially severe outcomes of COVID-19,"" that statement continued. ""Those who have not received their initial booster dose are strongly encouraged to do so."" “Current evidence suggests some waning of protection over time against serious outcomes from COVID-19 in older and immunocompromised individuals,” said Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, in a statement. “Based on an analysis of emerging data, a second booster dose of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine could help increase protection levels for these higher-risk individuals.” The CDC has already recommended that people age 12 and older with moderate or severely compromised immune systems who originally got the Pfizer or Moderna vaccination shot get a fourth dose of vaccine, and those with such weakened immune systems who originally got the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine to get two additional doses. Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious diseases expert, said in an interview that if he were advising his relatives, he might want those age 65 and older — and especially those 75 and older — to get the second booster shot. Getting a second booster shot is less urgent for a relatively healthy person in their 50s, Chin-Hong said. But a second booster shot would allow them to get an antibody boost that may help “protect them against getting a breakthrough infection,” Chin-Hong said. Such a fourth dose might be helpful for people who are traveling to, say, a wedding or another country, and want to take additional steps to avoid getting infected. It will take more time for researchers to determine how much additional benefit people will get from a fourth dose of vaccine. Clearly, there’s a big benefit after a second dose, and again following the first booster, Chin-Hong said. Early data from Israel, however, suggest the additional benefit after the second booster isn’t as substantial. But the second booster may still be worth getting, and, especially for older people, potentially lifesaving people. The second booster is safe, Chin-Hong said: “You don’t get immune exhaustion, you don’t get more side effects. It’s well-tolerated.” Added Dr. Robert Kim-Farley, a UCLA epidemiologist and infectious disease expert: “We do note waning immunity following the third dose. And in some studies, a fourth dose has been able to bring the antibody level back up to what it was shortly after the third dose. That would imply additional protection,” Kim-Farley said in an interview. Dr. Robert Wachter, chair of UC San Francisco's Department of Medicine, said in a tweet Tuesday that he recommends getting the booster for those who are older or those at higher risk. It's more of a toss-up for those at lower risk, but Wachter added that he thought the second booster would still be beneficial for them.

3/30/2022,"By James Mackenzie LUKYANIVKA, Ukraine (Reuters) - The burnt wreckage of two Russian tanks with blown off turrets and several armoured personnel carriers attest the ferocity of last week's clashes in Lukyanivka village just outside Kyiv. The charred corpse of a Russian soldier lies in a field nearby. ""There were mortars so strong that it was scary even in the cellar,"" local resident Valeriy Hudym told Reuters on Sunday, two days after Ukrainian soldiers seized back control of Lukyanivka in a five-hour battle with the Russians. ""Tanks were firing, artillery, and machine guns. Everything possible was there,"" Hudym said. Two Ukrainian soldiers, involved in the battle to retake the village, said the fighting was intense. More than a month since Russia's invasion, the defence of Ukraine's capital Kyiv has played out in heavy clashes in places like Lukyanivka and the nearby town of Brovary to the east, Irpin and Bucha to the northwest and Makariv to the west. When the histories are written such towns and villages may be minor details, but they are where the Russian advance has been halted, sometimes by small, mobile Ukrainian units wielding anti-tank weapons shipped in from abroad. Moscow promised at peace talks in Istanbul on Tuesday that it would drastically scale back operations around Kyiv to help the dialogue. In Lukyanivka, two hours' drive from the centre of Kyiv, residents recall warning Russian troops who had occupied their settlement to leave while they could. ""I have a neighbour called Svitlana. She told them openly to their face: 'Guys, go home. You will be killed here',"" Hudym said. Reuters was unable to independently confirm this. The reversal in Lukyanivka has been repeated in areas around the northern half of the capital, as Ukrainian troops claw back territory lost in the first month of fighting in small battles, without scoring a decisive victory. The Russian defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the military situation around Kyiv. But the small victories have dealt a psychological blow to a more powerful enemy and shown how nimble units with knowledge of the area can defend lines and even push them back, according to military experts. They also serve strategic goals - to keep Russian artillery further from the city centre and prevent the invading army from fully encircling Kyiv, the experts said. Cities including Kharkiv and Mariupol have suffered heavy bombardment as Russian ground advances stalled - part of what the Pentagon and other Western military officials describe as a sign of Russian frustration at the lack of progress. Kyiv has also been struck by shells and missiles, and at least 264 civilians have been killed according to city authorities. But the scale of devastation, particularly to the city centre, is far smaller, according to witnesses. Russia describes its actions in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" with the aim of demilitarising its neighbour. It has denied targeting civilians. In Lukyanivka, Reuters saw Ukrainian soldiers driving away two apparently serviceable Russian heavy tanks captured during the fighting. ""We knocked out the Russians. The Russians are now being moved a few kilometres away,"" said Marat Saifulin, from the Ukrainian ""Brotherhood battalion"" that took part in recapturing the village in an attack that lasted from noon until dusk. SETBACKS AND RESISTANCE CIA Director William Burns said in early March that the intention of Russian President Vladimir Putin was to seize Kyiv within two days of the start of the invasion on Feb. 24. Putin and Russian officials have consistently said that Russia's military operation in Ukraine has gone according to plan. However, two early setbacks suggested it would not be plain sailing for an available Russian force estimated by some diplomats before the war at around 190,000 troops. Russia has not given a figure for its deployment in Ukraine. Russian paratroopers attacked Hostomel airport, a potential bridgehead northwest of Kyiv, on the first day of the invasion. But heavy fighting there slowed the Russian advance toward the capital, according to the Wall Street Journal. Satellite imagery also captured a huge column of military hardware stretching 40 miles (64 km) and coming from a similar direction. Seen by some Western defence officials as a major threat to Kyiv in the first days of the war, by March 10 it had largely dispersed, with some vehicles spreading into surrounding towns. A senior U.S. defence official said in early March that Russia's advance on Kyiv, including the convoy, appeared to be stalling because of logistical problems including shortage of food and fuel, as well as low morale among some units. Attacks by small units of Ukrainian troops on advancing tank columns, in some cases using shoulder-held anti-tank weapons such as the U.S.-made Javelin system, were also a factor in bogging down Russia's military machine. To the east, in Brovary, a convoy of Russian tanks was repelled after several were destroyed in an ambush captured in dramatic drone footage released by pro-Ukrainian forces. To the north in Bucha, near Irpin, the town's mayor filmed scenes of burnt out tanks and armoured vehicles still smouldering after coming under fierce attack. In Irpin, Ukrainian forces destroyed a large bridge linking northwestern towns to Kyiv as a way of stalling the enemy's progress. On Monday, Irpin's mayor said Ukraine was back in full control. Reuters could not immediately verify his claim. The result of the flexible defensive strategy and Russian shortcomings has been no major advances on Kyiv for several days. In the city, where only half the peacetime population of 3.4 million remains, there have been signs of normal life returning to the streets, with some shops, restaurants and cinemas opening and people enjoying the spring sunshine in parks. Hopes that the immediate threat to the capital may be receding were fuelled last week by the head of the Russian General Staff's Main Operational Directorate. He said that the first phase of the operation in Ukraine had largely been completed and that Russian forces would henceforth concentrate on the Donbass region in the east. That appeared to chime with Western intelligence assessments that Russian forces had abandoned, at least for the moment, their active attempt to take Kyiv following heavy losses and unexpectedly stubborn Ukrainian defences. PAYING PENSIONS, POOR MORALE On many roads leading out of Kyiv, wrecked houses and debris show the price paid by those who decided to stay. Gas and electricity is often cut and there is no certainty about when and where the next missile might fall. In Krasylivka village, 92-year-old Hanna Yevdokimova said the invasion was her third conflict after the Soviet-Finnish Winter War of 1939-1940 and World War Two, when she saw German troops march through the village. Last week, her home was hit by missile wreckage. A twisted fragment of a Russian Kalibr missile lay 100 metres (328 ft) away in a neighbour's garden. ""What can I do? All I want is to rebuild so that I can die in my own home,"" she said. Some residents of Lukyanivka said they spent nearly a month under Russian occupation as virtual prisoners in their own homes, their mobile phones confiscated and movement only permitted under armed escort. Now they can come and go as they please amid badly damaged houses. Near Makariv west of Kyiv, which is still contested, heavy shelling could be heard last week. Even so, the town's mayor Vadym Tokar travelled through surrounding villages wearing military fatigues and handing out pensions to the elderly. Farmer Vasyl Chaylo, from Peremoha, described what he said were fearful Russian conscripts, short on rations and disciplined by tougher professional fighters. ""They are afraid. According to my observation, some of them perhaps do not want to fight and want to surrender, but they are kept in line by special forces,"" he said. Chaylo added that he had asked tank crews who set up outside his house how long their dry rations would last and been told a week. ""They came to us on the eighth day and said that they had nothing to eat."" Russia's defence ministry has acknowledged some conscripts have taken part in the conflict, after earlier denials by the Kremlin and military authorities. The ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment about rations. Halyna Shybka, a former nurse in a military hospital in Kyiv for 25 years, ignored the entreaties of her grandchildren and remains with her husband Mykola in the house in Kalynivka, near the frontlines of Brovary, where they have lived in since 1974. ""They tried to persuade us in every way they could to leave with them, but I wanted to stay,"" she said, pouring cups of tea in her small kitchen, the sound of outgoing Ukrainian artillery fire rumbling in the background. ""This is our land, we're not going to leave.""

3/30/2022,"Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly rejected a note from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy seeking peace in the more than a month-long conflict. When the note was hand-delivered to him by Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich, Putin reportedly replied instead: ""Tell him I will thrash them."" The Times of London reported Monday that Abramovich, a close ally of Putin acting as Russia’s envoy to Ukrainian negotiators, last week met Putin in Moscow and presented him with a handwritten note from Zelenskyy outlining the conditions he would consider in order to reach a cease-fire agreement. Though the newspaper did not disclose the exact contents of the alleged note, The Times said Putin’s response was unequivocally clear: ""Tell him I will thrash them."" Fox News has not verified the report. RUSSIA, UKRAINE NEGOTIATORS HOLD IN-PERSON TALKS IN TURKEY AS MOSCOW SAYS IT WILL PULL BACK FROM KYIV, CHERNIHIV Abramovich, who along with two top Ukrainian diplomats reportedly suffered a suspected poisoning in Kyiv earlier this month, was present in person Tuesday in Istanbul, Turkey, where another round of talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations happened for the first time in nearly three weeks. His exact role in the talks was unclear, as the Kremlin has stressed Abramovich is not an official member of the delegation in Istanbul but has been serving as a go-between for the Russian and Ukrainian sides. Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Kingdom, Vadym Prystaiko, was critical of Abramovich’s presence at the talks hosted at the Dolmabahce Palace, commenting to the BBC on Tuesday, ""I don't know if he's buying his way out somehow or if he's really useful, that's very difficult to tell."" The Wall Street Journal and Netherlands-based investigative group, Bellingcat, both reported about the suspected poisoning on Monday, saying Abramovich, Ukrainian lawmaker Rustem Umerov and another negotiator had all experienced symptoms that included red eyes, constant and painful tearing, and peeling skin on their faces and hands following a March 3 meeting in Kyiv. The reports said the conditions of the three men have since improved and their lives weren’t in danger. But contacted by Fox News, a spokesman for Zelenskyy’s office denied reports about the poisoning, as did Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who told Russian media the reports were false and part of an ""information war."" Umerov tweeted, ""I’m fine,"" Monday, warning not to trust ""unverified information."" Still, BBC reported that Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba said on Ukrainian TV hours before Tuesday’s talks in Istanbul that he advised colleagues not to eat or drink anything. The Russian government has previously been accused of poisoning perceived dissenters. The Kremlin has been tied to the 2020 nerve agent attack on Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in Siberia, the 2018 nerve agent attack on Sergei Skripal, a former Russian military officer who defected to the U.K., and his daughter Yulia, and the 2004 poisoning of pro-Western Ukrainian presidential candidate Viktor Yushchenko, who was left permanently disfigured following the attack. Speaking at a press conference in Morocco Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there’s ""concern"" of reports about the poisoning due to Russia’s ""track record"" with Navalny and others. Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea football club, has been sanctioned by the U.K. and the European Union, but the Journal previously reported that Zelenskyy asked the U.S. not to sanction Abramovich due to his role in facilitating talks and his growing interest in humanitarian issues, including potentially organizing civilian evacuations from the besieged Mariupol, so the U.S. Treasury paused plans to do so. Russian state-run news agency Ria Novosti published a photo Tuesday showing Abramovich speaking with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu at the meeting. The BBC noted that Abramovich, who also holds Israeli and Portuguese citizenship and owns a minority stake in the steel company Evraz PLC, was seen on Turkish television coverage of the talks listening to a translation through headphones while sitting next to Erdogan’s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin at a separate table from the main delegations on Tuesday. As talks were underway Tuesday, Russian Deputy Defense Minister Alexander Fomin told reporters in Moscow that his country has agreed to ""fundamentally cut back military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv"" in order to ""increase mutual trust for future negotiations to agree and sign a peace deal with Ukraine,"" according to the Financial Times. The announcement did not signal any relief, however, for the besieged cities of Odesa or Mariupol, which have suffered heavy Russian bombardment.",World/Fox News,Putin outraged by Zelenskyy note delivered by Russian oligarch Ambramovich: 'Tell him I will thrash him',https://news.yahoo.com/putin-outraged-zelenskyy-note-delivered-151705385.html
