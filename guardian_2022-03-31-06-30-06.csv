3/31/2022,"China’s proposed treaty with Solomon Islands is an “adverse development for Australia’s security” but it may be too late to stop the deal, a former senior Australian intelligence official has warned. Richard Maude, head of the Office of National Assessments from 2013 to 2016 and an experienced former diplomat, urged the Morrison government not to engage in megaphone diplomacy as it tried to persuade Solomon Islands to change course. In an interview with Guardian Australia, Maude said the Australian government should raise its concerns “through quiet diplomacy” because “any perception that we’re leaning on the Solomon Islands government would be counterproductive”. The prime minister of Solomon Islands, Manasseh Sogavare, this week dismissed foreign criticism of the country’s security negotiations with Beijing as “insulting” and blamed the leak of the draft document on “some lunatics and agents of foreign regimes in the government system”. A draft version of an agreement, which emerged online last week, said Solomon Islands may request China to send police, armed police, military personnel and other law enforcement and armed forces to the country for a range of tasks such as maintaining social order and protecting lives and property. According to the draft text, the agreement would also pave the way for China to “make ship visits to, carry out logistical replenishment in, and have stopover and transition in Solomon Islands” while Chinese forces “can be used to protect the safety of Chinese personnel and major projects in Solomon Islands”. The Australian and New Zealand governments have raised concerns the agreement could undermine the security and stability of the Pacific region. Sogavare told parliament on Tuesday there was “no intention whatsoever to ask China to build a military base in the Solomon Islands” and added that the document was “ready for signing”. Maude, who has served in senior security and foreign policy roles under both sides of Australian politics, said the deal appeared likely to proceed. “I think the chances of turning it off are slim now,” he said. He said it was “emblematic of an increasingly tough contest for influence in the Pacific and a future in which China will press its interests where it can very strongly”. Maude, who was a national security adviser to Julia Gillard and led the ONA under Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull, said it “potentially opens the door to a stronger and more frequent Chinese military presence in the Pacific”. An agreement that sought to facilitate more Chinese ship visits “gives the Chinese navy a toehold in the Pacific”. “That’s something that Australian defence and strategic planners are right to be very concerned about,” said Maude, now a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute.

It makes it easier for China to interfere in the affairs of island countries. It could spark responses from other countries, including Australia, leading to a more crowded Pacific in a military sense. None of that is good for the stability of the Pacific.” Maude said Australia was right to argue that such developments were “fundamentally not in the interests of Pacific Island countries”. “Many Pacific island governments will see opportunity in their relations with China as much as they might see risk,” he said, adding: “One big problem for Australia is not that China sees a role for itself in the Pacific, but from Canberra’s perspective that China’s approach in the Pacific is too often zero-sum. “It seeks advantage for itself at Australia and others’ expense, often without regard for the stability of island countries and the integrity of their politics.” Maude led the whole-of-government taskforce behind Australia’s 2017 foreign policy white paper, which noted that many countries in the Pacific had “limited capacity to respond individually to security challenges”. The white paper said Australia would work with Honiara to protect stability as the regional assistance mission to Solomon Islands wound down in 2017. The Australian government vowed then to “step up our efforts to support a more resilient Pacific”. Maude said the launch of Australia’s Pacific Step-Up initiative and additional funding commitments in 2018 were “a clear indication that perhaps Australia was coasting in the region and needed to do more to response to Pacific Island needs and bolster its own influence in this new, competitive era”. But he stopped short of saying Australia had dropped the ball, “because that takes the Pacific island countries themselves out of the equation”. Maude said Australia should seek to be “the best possible partner that we can be” in responding to the needs of Pacific countries. He called for broader increase in foreign aid across the board, saying while Tuesday’s budget had ended the freeze on official development assistance it was still “inadequate for the times we’re in”. The Australian government has insisted it was not blindsided by the emergence of the draft security agreement. The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, said the government had been been “aware of increasing interest with engagement with China in the Solomon Islands for some time” and had “regularly and respectfully raised our concerns”. Payne said Australia had demonstrated it was “always ready to support the Solomon Islands, together with members of the Pacific family”. Labor’s foreign affairs spokesperson, Penny Wong, said it was “gravely concerning for Australia’s interests that this agreement enables an enhanced Chinese security presence 1,500km from our shore”. “[Scott] Morrison talks tough on China, but on his watch a member of our Pacific family plans to sign a security treaty with China,” Wong said. The independent senator Jacqui Lambie said the Australian government’s Pacific Step up had “failed miserably” and the Coalition “should be ashamed”.",News/Australia news,"It may be too late to stop China-Solomon Islands treaty, former Australian intelligence chief says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/31/it-may-be-too-late-to-stop-china-solomon-islands-treaty-former-australian-intelligence-chief-says
3/31/2022,"South Korea has said it has successfully test-fired a solid-fuel space rocket for the first time, as it attempts to ramp up its defences after North Korea’s recent launch of a long-range missile and amid speculation that the regime could soon conduct a nuclear test. The South’s defence ministry said Wednesday’s launch, from a site 150km (93 miles) south-west of Seoul, was an “important milestone” in the country’s ability to monitor its neighbour, as it would allow it to eventually launch satellites to spy on the North. The launch came days after North Korea tested what it described as its largest intercontinental ballistic missile [ICBM] yet, although South Korean officials believe the missile involved was not, as Pyongyang claims, a new Hwasong-17, but a less powerful missile last tested in 2017. The defence ministry said the space rocket test “came at a very grave juncture in which North Korea has recently breached its moratorium and launched an ICBM”. “The success of the test launch of this solid-propelled space launch vehicle is an important milestone in strengthening the defence power of our military’s independent space-based surveillance and reconnaissance field at a very critical time,” ministry said, citing North Korea’s recent ICBM test. The launch had been conducted with “pure Korean technology”, it added. The test has also raised concerns about a new arms race on the Korean peninsula, coming less than a year after South Korea and the US agreed to end decades of restrictions on Seoul’s ballistic missile and rocket development, including a ban on missiles with a maximum range of more than 800km. Seoul responded to last week’s ICBM test with a rare show of force, weeks before the country’s new conservative president, Yoon Suk-yeol, takes office, having promised a tougher stance against his country’s “main enemy” than under the outgoing liberal president, Moon Jae-in. Hours after the ICBM launch, South Korea’s military responded with a volley of missile launches from the ground, sea and air – an indication that it may no longer be willing to restrict its response to North Korean provocations with the simple words of condemnation. The defence ministry noted that space was becoming critical to the South’s national security and vowed to strengthen its space defence capabilities. North Korea had not launched a long-range missile or conducted a nuclear test since late 2017, but broke its self-imposed moratorium last week, describing the test as a “historical event” that would help curb “dangerous military attempts” by the US. But officials in South Korea this week dismissed the North’s claims and accused it of firing a less-powerful existing weapon and fabricating data after a failed Hwasong-17 launch a week earlier. The defence ministry said factors such as the missile’s speed, combustion and stage separation were similar to those of the Hwasong-15, not the Hwasong-17. The ministry also suggested that a North Korean video of the launch was not shot on the actual launch date, citing an analysis of shadows cast by the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and weather conditions seen in the film. North Korea has also conducted satellite launches, but the US says they are covers for tests of ballistic missile technology banned under UN security council sanctions. In October, South Korea conducted the first test launch of the Nuri liquid-fuelled rocket, its first domestically built space launch vehicle. Nuri blasted off but failed to fully place a dummy satellite into orbit. In contrast to the Nuri’s liquid-fuel design, a solid-fuel rocket such as the one tested on Wednesday would be simpler, less expensive to develop and manufacture, and faster to launch, the defence ministry said.

3/31/2022,"Vladimir Putin has made a strategic miscalculation in launching the invasion of Ukraine and his advisers are “afraid to tell him the truth” about the extent of his error, the boss of British spy agency GCHQ will say in a speech on Thursday. Sir Jeremy Fleming, due to give a speech in Australia, said the Russian leader had misjudged the strength of Ukrainian resistance, the western response and the ability of his forces to deliver a rapid victory. “It all adds up to the strategic miscalculation that western leaders warned Putin it would be. It’s become his personal war, with the cost being paid by innocent people in Ukraine and, increasingly, by ordinary Russians too,” Fleming will say, according to a prereleased text of his remarks. Western security officials want to lay the responsibility for February’s unprovoked invasion on Putin, who they characterise as a dominant, isolated leader who is making poor decisions partly because he no longer gets accurate information or honest opinions from his subordinates. As a result, Fleming said he believed that the failure to achieve a quick victory must be causing discord in the Kremlin. “And even though we believe Putin’s advisers are afraid to tell him the truth, what’s going on and the extent of these misjudgments must be crystal clear to the regime.” Earlier, US officials made a similar point, arguing that Putin was being misled by advisers who were too scared to tell him how poorly the war in Ukraine is going and how damaging western sanctions have been. “We have information that Putin felt misled by the Russian military which has resulted in persistent tension between Putin and his military leadership,” said Kate Bedingfield, director of communications at the White House.“We believe that Putin is being misinformed by his advisers about how badly the Russian military is performing and how the Russian economy is being crippled by sanctions because his senior advisers are too afraid to tell him the truth.” She added: “So, it is increasingly clear that Putin’s war has been a strategic blunder that has left Russia weaker over the long term and increasingly isolated on the world stage.” Ahead of the invasion, Putin held a bizarre meeting with his key advisers over whether to recognise the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. Some senior figures were clearly in fear of the president, who has led the country for 22 years, as he demanded each endorse the breakaway territories. There were also growing signs, Fleming is expected to say, that Russian soldiers “short of weapons and morale” were “refusing to carry out orders, sabotaging their own equipment and even accidentally shooting down their own aircraft”. No evidence was given to back up the air accident claim, although Whitehall sources said they were confident enough to allow Fleming to refer to it in the speech, partly to demonstrate to Russian insiders their knowledge of the military situation. The spy chief also warned China not to become “too closely aligned” with Russia as the war continues, the latest in a string of remarks by western leaders and officials aimed at trying to persuade Beijing not to supply Moscow with money and arms. Fleming said that Putin has made a clear “strategic choice” to align with China before the fighting broke out, but that there remained underlying tensions between the two countries – and risks for both in trying to work together. “Russia understands that, long term, China will become increasingly strong militarily and economically. Some of their interests conflict; Russia could be squeezed out of the equation,” Fleming is expected to say. “And it is equally clear that a China that wants to set the rules of the road – the norms for a new global governance – is not well served by close alliance with a regime that wilfully and illegally ignores them all.”",News/World news,"Putin advisers ‘afraid to tell him truth’ about Ukraine error, says GCHQ head",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/30/putin-advisers-russia-ukraine-error-gchq-head-jeremy-fleming-speech
3/31/2022,"Good morning. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will address Australia’s parliament tonight, followed soon after by Anthony Albanese’s budget reply. A senior Zelenskiy aide has claimed the leader could meet “soon” with Vladimir Putin, even as the Kremlin downplayed hopes of an early breakthrough in peace talks. Barnaby Joyce has dissolved the national advisory body established less than two years ago to scrutinise major water projects. This came after an expert member of the body, Stuart Khan, expressed concern in letters to other members that the government’s funding announcements to build dams had been made for “brazenly political purposes” and without the body having been given an opportunity to consider the proposals. Lismore residents’ stoicism has given way to a “splintering of confidence and will” after the town was once again inundated by flood waters, according to locals. There is frustration, too, at emergency communication when an evacuation order was rescinded at 5pm on Tuesday and then reinstated at 3am yesterday. “I have been at the evacuation centre and some of the same people who were there four weeks ago are back again,” a former mayor says. “The look on their faces is shock, trauma: ‘I can’t do this again, it’s too hard.’ The weather system has been responsible for a deluge of rain across the region, and which has seen Byron Bay residents caught off-guard by floods, continues its march south, with tens of thousands of people being evacuated. Russia has been accused of intensifying its bombardment of the besieged Ukrainian city of Chernihiv and continuing to attack Kyiv despite claims the Kremlin would draw back out of respect for peace talks. Vladyslav Atroshenko, Chernihiv’s mayor, said the Russians had lied and that they were continuing to heavily hit his city. “They’re saying reducing intensity, they actually have increased the intensity of strikes,” he told CNN. Vladimir Putin has told Emmanuel Macron that shelling of Mariupol will end only when Ukrainian troops surrender. Australia’s minimum wage should be raised by 5%, or $2,000 a year, to counter inflation and living costs, unions say. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has called for the minimum wage to increase from $20.33 an hour to $21.35. Epidemiologists are calling for QR code tracking of rapid antigen tests and random community testing to gauge Australia’s true Covid numbers, with estimates that case numbers could be much higher than is officially reported. Global melanoma cases are set to rise by 50% by 2040, with a 68% increase in deaths, according to research. In Australia, the skin cancer rate is rising in over-50s but “declining quite steeply” among younger age groups.

Bruce Willis will retire from acting after being diagnosed with aphasia, “which is impacting his cognitive abilities”, his family said. Donald Trump used an official White House phone to place at least one call during the Capitol attack that was not on the official call log, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The former national security adviser John Bolton has revealed that he heard Trump use the term “burner phones” several times and that they discussed how the devices were used as a way of avoiding scrutiny. Germany and Austria have moved a step closer to gas rationing after activating an emergency plan designed to help them cope with any disruption in supplies from Russia. Comedian Zoë Coombs Marr has resurrected her hit character Dave, who has been in a coma since 2016, for her new show Dave: The Opener, which is on at the Melbourne comedy festival. With a character like Dave there is a fine line, Coombs Marr says, between making fun of Dave’s offensiveness, and the show itself being offensive. She’s constantly asking, “Is it worth doing it and making people feel uncomfortable?” she says. “Comedy is often about taboos and walking fine lines and catharsis and satire … But you have a duty of care to your audience as well.” When comics complain “you can’t say anything any more”, Coombs Marr says, “no, you’re just not working hard enough. Or you’re out of tune with what your job actually is.” This week British musical comedians Flo & Joan share what makes them laugh, including a strange number of videos involving tiny hands and Debbie Reynolds pretending to be a football. “Watching Debbie Reynolds dressed as a football being fwipped around is a corner of cinema that we are blessed to know,” they say.
