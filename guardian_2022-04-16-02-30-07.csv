4/16/2022,"This week the Indigenous Sámi people of Norway celebrated a historic event: the return to the village of Karasjok (Kárášjohka in the northern Sámi language) of a rune drum that had been confiscated in 1691 from a Sámi man who was tried for witchcraft. At the time, the Nordic colonisers of the Arctic were energetically Christianising the Sámi population, whose animist spirituality depended on a sense of connectedness with the lands they inhabited and the animals with which they interacted. Rune drums, made from birchwood and reindeer skin, helped a noaidi, or shaman, to enter a trance and walk among spirits. They could also be used to divine future events: insight was gained by noting where, when the drum was struck, a ring moved in relation to the symbols painted on its surface. This particular noaidi drum – there are many examples in museums in Sweden, Germany, the UK and elsewhere – happens to be particularly well documented. The court transcripts survive, including a detailed account given by its owner, Poala-Ánde, of its uses. He claimed, poignantly, that “he wanted to help people in distress, and with his art he wanted to do good”. A verdict was never reached in the trial since, before it could be handed down, Poala-Ánde was brutally murdered. The confiscated drum was sent to the authorities in Copenhagen and passed into the royal collection, becoming part of the National Museum of Denmark. Over the past 40 years, during which time the drum has been on loan to the Sámi Museum in Karasjok, the Sámi people have been arguing for ownership to be formally handed over to the institution. After an appeal to Queen Margrethe of Denmark, that has at last happened. “I feel,” said Silje Karine Muotka, president of the Sámi parliament in Norway, “that [Poala-Ánde’s] power is with us as we continue to take ownership of our own history for future generations.” The Sámi people – whose population of 60-70,000 is scattered through Sweden, Norway, Finland and Russia’s Kola peninsula – have long been the victims of internal colonialism, their views sidelined in the rush for natural resources, whether timber, nickel or even wind power. Now they find themselves on the frontline of climate crisis, with rising temperatures affecting Arctic weather patterns, ecosystems, and traditional ways of living such as reindeer herding. But, with a revival in political self-consciousness, and a young generation taking back the dwindling Sámi languages and taking pride in their culture, the people of the Sápmi nation are taking their place among a network of Indigenous peoples from around the world, notably those from the Amazon, who are increasingly being recognised as holders of knowledge that may yet help the wider world tackle climate crisis. Later this month, too, Sámi artists will step on to the global stage when they exhibit in the Nordic pavilion – renamed this year the Sámi pavilion – at the world’s most celebrated international art event, the Venice Biennale. The Sámi drum is a powerful symbol of a people insisting on the validity of their belief systems – systems that tell us that humans, animals and land are intimately connected, and that harm to one means harm to all.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on returning a Sámi shaman’s drum: a sign of hope | Editorial ,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/15/the-guardian-view-on-returning-a-sami-shamans-drum-a-sign-of-hope
4/16/2022,"In almost all other tennis careers, players tend to have the benefit of making their first mistakes in relative silence. The first steps on a new surface usually take place in the anonymity of the ITF circuit or in the back courts of a lower level tour event - they learn, they grow, and then eventually they thrive on their terms. It is fair to say that such avenues are no longer open to Emma Raducanu. On Friday she was charged with finding her feet on clay as the No 1 player for her country against the dominant nation in the sport. Moments earlier, her teammate, Harriet Dart, had managed to win just one game in the opening rubber. The pressure was undeniable. Yet she rose to the moment admirably, recovering from doubtful deficits in both sets through the strength of her grit and perseverance, eventually overcoming No 50 Tereza Martincova 7-5, 7-5 to win on her Billie Jean King Cup debut and keep Great Britain in contention. Earlier in the day, Marketa Vondrousova opened the tie by eviscerating Dart 6-1, 6-0, meaning the BJK Cup Qualifier with the Czech Republic is finely poised at 1-1 ahead of the final day. “This one means so much to me because it is my first match in the Billie Jean King Cup,” said Raducanu afterwards. “To represent my team and come out here for my first professional match on a clay court is really amazing. We are still in this battle. It’s all to play for tomorrow.” As the attritional exchanges took hold in frequent gusts of wind, Martincova continually picked apart the Raducanu forehand, challenging her to dictate off her weaker wing while grinding her down. It slowly worked as Martincova broke serve at 4-4 and generated a set point as she attempted to serve out the set. But as the match wore on, Raducanu searched for solutions and she found them. She began to implement more topspin into her strokes, throwing up loopy balls to arrest the momentum of rallies or dragging Martincova off the court with additional width. Raducanu saved the set point at 5-4 and reeled off three tough games to take the set. In the second set, however, her level dropped as she fell down 1-4 with two breaks. But this time Raducanu pulled her game together by continuing to disrupt Martincova by varying the trajectory of her shots. In the numerous exhausting games that followed, including a manic game at 4-4 on Raducanu’s serve that included nine deuces and four break points, she slowly pulled back to win. “I’ve [been] playing really good tennis for a set, maybe a set and a half, then my energy dips,” she said. “And then I find myself in an absolute battle and it lets me down. But today I feel like it’s another step in the right direction because I’ve managed to overcome that. So that does give me a lot of confidence.” Raducanu arrived in Prague with a 2-5 record in 2022 and this is the highest ranked opponent she has even taken a set off since the US Open semi-final. A personal step forward for her, it also puts her team in an interesting position as she returns on Saturday morning to face Vondrousova as the clear underdog. In the opening rubber, Vondrousova responded to losing her opening service game by reeling off 12 games in a row to dismantle Dart in 55 minutes. For Dart, the challenge would have been extremely difficult on any surface, but on clay against the 2019 French Open finalist, who is an artist with the drop shot, it was simply overwhelming. The one-sided result leaves captain Anne Keothavong with a decision to make about whether to play Dart again, Katie Swan or particularly the promising but completely inexperienced 20-year-old Sonay Kartal. “I believe we’ve got a good chance,” said Keothavong. “We came here as underdogs. The Czechs still are the heavy favourites but we will review how both matches went todayand put all the game plans in place. It requires the players to be able to execute under pressure, but they will be as well prepared as possible.” As Keothavong finished, Raducanu leaned forward with a mischievous smile on her face to address no one in particular: “The Brits love being underdogs, by the way,” she said.",Sport/Sport,Raducanu battles past Martincova as Britain level Billie Jean King Cup tie ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/15/emma-raducanu-shows-spirit-against-tereza-martincova-to-level-billie-jean-cup-tie
4/16/2022,"When you are faced with opposition on the level of this St Helens side – arguably the best of the modern era, though that is a discussion for another day – it is those little glimmers of hope which hurt the most. By the end, Wigan’s race in the latest instalment of rugby league’s richest rivalry had long since been run, with a ninth defeat in 10 against their greatest foes from across the Billinge Hill somewhat of a formality. The final scoreline underlines the dominance St Helens have on everyone else in Super League, and that includes a Wigan side who are almost certainly their greatest obstacle to a fourth consecutive title as things stand. Yet it is just how ruthless the reigning champions are when their backs are against the wall which sets them apart. Wigan had played their part in a thrilling opening quarter, and arguably even deserved to take the lead in front of a sellout crowd of 17,980. Jai Field’s try which made it 4-0 in the Warriors’ favour had threatened a much closer derby than we ended up with. There would have been cautious optimism, perhaps even hope, among the thousands of travelling Wigan supporters that they could grind out what would have been a famous victory against their great rivals. Throw in the fact that St Helens’s Morgan Knowles, arguably the best forward in Super League, left the field with a head knock and never returned, and you wondered what was in store here. But in the end, this ruthless, metronomic rugby league juggernaut did what they always do. They responded to those moments of adversity, clicked through the gears and, by the time the full-time hooter had sounded, they had once again underlined their superiority in one-sided fashion. After that Field try, St Helens scored 22 unanswered points either side of half-time to vanquish the hope which may have briefly accrued in the minds of Wigan supporters. “This group did what they do every week,” Kristian Woolf said. “They hung in, they didn’t get frustrated and eventually we found the points we needed.” Both major derbies on Good Friday went the way of the home sides, with Hull Kingston Rovers further suggesting they are now the dominant club by the banks of the Humber after a deserved 16-4 victory against Hull FC. Here, Field’s early try put the Warriors ahead but St Helens responded to going behind superbly as Konrad Hurrell’s flick pass sent Tommy Makinson across in the corner. That levelled the scores at 4-4 but, with half-time approaching, St Helens began to up the intensity. As they piled the pressure on the Warriors, it felt like an inevitability when they eventually went ahead as Makinson and Jonny Lomax combined to send the latter across. Makinson converted, before adding a penalty on half-time to make it 12-4 and, despite a promising start, Wigan suddenly found themselves two scores behind. “When they got opportunities they took them, they were clinical,” Wigan’s coach, Matty Peet, said. “In the second half they were much better and we failed to hold them.” There were only 10 points scored in that second half but they all went St Helens’s way. The first try after half-time was crucial in the context of the game, and it went to the hosts when Mark Percival teed up Joe Batchelor. Sam Powell was then sent to the sin bin for a dangerous tackle which could see him banned for an extended period and, when he was off the field, Percival pounced on a loose pass to make absolutely sure that, as it has been so many times in recent years, this would be St Helens’s day.",Sport/Sport,St Helens win one-sided derby as Mark Percival piles misery on Wigan,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/15/st-helens-win-one-sided-derby-as-mark-percival-piles-misery-on-wigan
4/16/2022,"As someone of mixed Scottish and English heritage who was brought up in a town with a large population of people with a Scottish background, I found Rory Scothorne’s article interesting (An independent Scotland would need a national anthem – but what would it be?, 9 April). But he does not make clear enough the main problem with Flower of Scotland. It is about a battle that took place nearly 700 years ago, when the Scottish king beat the English one. It is blatantly anti-English. This is also one of the main problems with Scottish nationalism. It seems that the main desire of its proponents is to put one over the English. If Scotland and its people want to move forward as a nation, they should choose an anthem that looks forward, not back.Gordon GlassfordCorby, Northamptonshire  I’m sure I won’t be alone in advocating for Michael Marra’s Hermless to be the new national anthem. Marra’s advocacy of the virtues of quietism in part reflects his Dundonian background; in a city of independent wage-earner women, male partners could be relegated to the role of “kettle bilers”, while the women went out to work in the city’s mills. Being everything a national anthem shouldn’t be, Hermless’s advocacy of never causing “bother” is just perfect for a new day. If you’re Scottish and you haven’t heard it, I can only ask, “whit’s wrang wi’ ye?” For the non-Scot, there’s Loudon Wainwright’s anglicised version, Harmless; he describes Marra’s song as the greatest ever written.Alistair RichardsonStirling  As a Scot who has long lived in various countries and is now retired in France, I have an occasional twinge of nostalgia for my homeland. But a recent conversation with friends revealed that many feel Flower of Scotland is too dirge-like. I do not know the other songs cited in Rory Scothorne’s article, but I would vote for Scotland the Brave – the lyrics are so evocative. While not being martial, it competes favourably with the stirring La Marseillaise, which, despite a certain bloodthirstiness, comes in high on any list of uplifting anthems.Veronica StiastnySt Romain-en-Viennois, France  National anthems should celebrate the culture and ethos of a country, not the killing of a neighbour. Hamish Henderson’s wonderful Freedom Come All Ye was suggested by the Scottish nationalists as an anthem, but Henderson disapproved as he wanted Scotland to be internationalist, not narrowly nationalist. Perhaps a future anthem should reflect internationalism more than nationalism.John MorganTullibody, Clackmannanshire  Rory Scothorne has missed an obvious candidate. Written by Robert Burns to a very singable tune, the last verse of A Man’s a Man For A’ That avoids the taint of anti-English sentiment. It stands alone as one verse (though the rest of the poem is worth knowing) and is undeniably forward-looking. The last two lines sum up what we should all strive for: “That man to man, the world o’er / Shall brothers be…”Eli CurrieEdinburgh  Surely the best suggestion is The Ball of Kirriemuir (AKA Four and Twenty Virgins). I am sure Scottish MSPs would happily link arms and bellow it out to the Queen. Scotland could become the only country whose national anthem could not be televised before the watershed.Martin GuhaBlackheath, London  Reading Rory Scothorne as an Englishman who lived in Scotland for 20 years and has often thought about this, Hamish Henderson’s song is a good choice. But may I suggest Rolling Home to Caledonia, as sung by the Whistlebinkies in 1988.

4/16/2022,"Michael Marmot (Studying health inequalities has been my life’s work. What’s about to happen in the UK is unprecedented, 9 April) raises a grim spectre for the health of the poverty-stricken in the UK. However, the warning given in his article is not unprecedented, even if the dire consequences are. Forty-two years ago, the Black report on inequalities in health found that there were differences in mortality rates across the social groups, with those in lower social groups suffering higher rates of mortality. It also found inequalities in access to health services, with low rates of uptake by the working classes to preventive services in particular. It was ready for release by the then Labour government in early 1979, but sat on by the succeeding Tory government until August 1980. The only hope in the 42 years since then was Gordon Brown’s 1998 Sure Start programme, which aimed to tackle poverty and health by trying to give children the best possible start in life. I’d like to hear what Marmot feels are the reasons why the public psyche is largely oblivious to the poverty and health cause and effect. Is it the grip of illiberal “liberal” capitalism or the fact that Tory governments just have no idea how people actually live?Jonathan HauxwellCrosshills, North Yorkshire  Michael Marmot’s account of the increasing levels of inequality and poverty in this country is an indictment of all our politicians for failing to give priority to the most needy in our society. I think of the passage in St Matthew’s gospel in which Jesus praises those who feed the hungry, welcome the stranger, clothe the naked, care for the sick and comfort the prisoner: “as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me”. Our duty is clear, as is the duty of our politicians, who should be judged on one thing above all others, their treatment of “the least” in our society. I can think of no better manifesto promise than a commitment to “the least”, the people Marmot characterises as unable to meet their basic needs.Peter PhilpottPatrick Brompton, North Yorkshire  Michael Marmot’s hard-hitting and accurate description of the impact of poverty on both mental and physical health is essential reading, especially for politicians, policymakers and clinicians. He emphasises that “the essentials of life include whatever is necessary to take your place in public without shame”. A lack of essentials leads to poorer mental health, and this applies to all citizens, including people with learning disabilities, asylum seekers and other excluded groups. Marmot makes a good case for universal basic services. In wealthy Britain, no one should be dependent on charity to live and to belong – isn’t this what levelling up should be about?Sheila HollinsFounder and chair, Beyond Words  Michael Marmot says that scarcity “reduces intellectual bandwidth”. That in turn leads people to make bad choices. Another terrifying thing about the times that we live in is that the bad choices include not voting or – worse, if possible – voting Conservative, for the very same people who created the poverty that you suffer from and who will make it worse.Jeremy CushingTaddyforde, Exeter  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

4/16/2022,"Your article (Shelf-promotion: the art of furnishing rooms with books you haven’t read, 8 April) reminded me that Myles na gCopaleen (AKA Flann O’Brien), who wrote for the Irish Times, spotted this trend a long time ago and suggested a service that might provide a useful income for today’s impoverished students. He’d visited the house of a newly married friend – “a man of great wealth and vulgarity” – who’d just “paid some rascally middleman” to stuff his library full of books as “some savage faculty for observation” had told him that respectable people had lots of books. The trouble was that these books were all pristine, betraying the philistine owner. That led Myles to suggest a book-handling service: the man obviously needed “a person who will maul the books”. In fact, there could be several degrees of book-handling, from the low-cost (four leaves in each to be dog-eared, and a tram ticket, cloak-room docket or other suitable bookmark inserted), to the high-end, which would have pencilled marginalia added (“Yes, but cf Homer, Od, iii, 151”; “I remember poor Joyce saying the very same thing to me”; and even forged messages of gratitude from the author – “From your devoted friend and follower, K Marx”).Karin BarryLondon  What a useful article, particularly for those of us with too many books looking for a home.

As Nick Rennison says in his book 1922, for poetry lovers “the great event” of October that year was the publication of AE Housman’s Last Poems. Twenty-six years after the appearance of A Shropshire Lad, the new collection attracted widespread critical acclaim. For JC Squire, writing in the Observer, the 41 poems contained “scarcely a line which is not perfectly musical, scarcely a word which is not accurate and necessary”. Sir Andrew Motion, in his foreword to the Housman Society’s commemorative edition, identifies themes shared with the modernists, but which are also revealed in the “self-conscious beauty” of both phrase and cadence.

The original family name was Chaika (“Seagull”) before it was changed to the more noble-sounding Chaikovsky by the composer’s grandfather, who eventually moved to Russia. Tchaikovsky’s Ukrainian origins were hardly celebrated by the Soviets nor today’s Russians. On 2 April, Russian missiles were blasted at the city of Kremenchuk, the birthplace of Pyotr Ilyich’s great-grandfather, Fedor Chaika, a Cossack who served in the Zaporozhian army.

4/16/2022,"Pep Guardiola has advised his players to “sleep, sleep, sleep” before Manchester City’s FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool on Saturday. The meeting with Jürgen Klopp’s team is a second in seven days – after Sunday’s Premier League draw – and a third game of the week after Wednesday’s attritional draw at Atlético Madrid. Although Guardiola would prefer a less congested schedule the manager has no complaints because this is a function of City competing on all fronts at the defining end of the campaign. “It happens for one reason: because we’re fighting for all the titles,” he said. “That is good news; I’m saying that with a big smile, it’s not that I am grumpy. I’m so happy to live that. It’s not an ideal situation but where in this world is an ideal situation? “Look what happens two, three hours away from here [the Russia-Ukraine war].

He [Walker] had a big twist, and he is getting better but we will see the process for the next hours and next days for the next games.” Zack Steffen has been City’s domestic cup goalkeeper in place of Ederson, the No 1.

Tonight or tomorrow morning I’ll decide but of course in the FA Cup normally we play Zack.” This is City’s fifth Cup semi-final under Guardiola, though they have reached only one final. “This is an incredible achievement and shows our consistency,” he said. “But we didn’t perform well in these semi-final games [that were lost].

4/16/2022,"Russia sent a formal warning to the US not to send more arms to Ukraine or it could face “unpredictable consequences”, it has been reported. According to the Washington Post, Moscow sent a diplomatic note, a démarche, warning that US and Nato deliveries of the “most sensitive” weapons systems to Ukraine were “adding fuel” to the conflict there and could bring “unpredictable consequences”. A spokesperson said the state department ddid not confirm any diplomatic correspondence as a matter of course, and made clear that the US would continue to send arms to Ukraine. “What we can confirm is that, along with allies and partners, we are providing Ukraine with billions of dollars worth of security assistance, which our Ukrainian partners are using to extraordinary effect to defend their country against Russia’s unprovoked aggression and horrific acts of violence,” the spokesperson said. The Russian embassy in Ukraine did not respond to a request for comment. The US is preparing to send the latest $800m (£610m) tranche of military aid to Ukraine, bringing to $2.6bn the total since the start of the war. The Biden administration has also made clear that it was sending increasingly heavy and sophisticated equipment, including helicopters, aerial and marine drones, and long-range 155mm howitzers, while training Ukrainian soldiers in their use. The US is also sending additional anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles of the sort that have contributed to the war effort so far in Ukraine. The Ukrainians claim to have sunk the Russian Black Sea fleet flagship Moskva on Thursday using Ukrainian-developed Neptune missiles. The UK has promised to send more anti-ship missiles to replenish stockpiles. Military experts believe that Ukraine’s anti-ship missile systems are what has deterred Russia up to now from attempting an amphibious landing around Odesa. It is unclear whether Moscow has sent similar diplomatic notes to European countries. On Thursday, the German vice-chancellor, Robert Habeck, appeared to back down on his demands earlier in the week for the Ukrainian army to be provided with what it needed as soon as possible. Habeck cited concerns about Russian reprisals. “Heavy weapons are synonymous with tanks, and all Nato countries have so far ruled this out to not become targets themselves,” he told Politico.
