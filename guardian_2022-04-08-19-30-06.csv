With new-season lamb now at Ocado, I like to make this one of the first things that goes on the barbecue in spring. The lamb cooks low and slow in the oven before a quick stint on the barbecue for a wonderful smoky flavour, perfect with a fresh pineapple salsa and a pile of tortillas alongside. If you don’t have a barbecue at your disposal, flash the lamb under a hot grill after the initial four-hour cooking time until it gains a little colour on top.

Leave them for 10 minutes to soften, then remove the stems. Tip the softened chillies into a small food processor or blender along with the vinegar, pineapple, garlic, onion, cumin, achiote paste, sea salt, olive oil and oregano. Blitz until you have a smooth paste. Score the lamb leg diagonally on both sides. Rub the marinade all over the lamb and into the cuts, then place in a deep roasting tin and cover with tinfoil. Pop the lamb into the fridge to marinate overnight. Five hours before you want to serve, preheat the oven to 140C (120C fan)/275F/gas 1. Transfer the lamb in its tin – still covered in tinfoil – into the oven, and cook for four hours, basting with the cooking juices halfway through. When the lamb has 30 minutes left in the oven, light the coals in your barbecue and let the flames die down. Remove the lamb from the oven and baste again, then place it on the grill rack. Cover and cook for 15 minutes, then baste again and flip it over for a final 15 minutes. While the lamb is on the barbecue, mix the pineapple, sliced red onion, chilli and coriander together, and set aside. Finally, shred the lamb, reserving some of the cooking juices to pour over, and scatter with a little sea salt. Serve with the pineapple salsa, tortillas, hot sauce and sour cream.

4/8/2022,"Maggie Fox, who has died aged 65 after an accident, was an actor of comic genius who had television roles in Coronation Street, Shameless and The Forsyte Saga but who will be best remembered as one half (“the tall one”) of the award-winning comedy duo LipService Theatre. She and her onstage partner, Sue Ryding, wrote and performed more than 22 original comedy shows from a distinctly female perspective over nearly 40 years – and toured them to scores of theatres throughout Britain and to the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Pakistan and the US. In an era when, long before Covid, regional theatre struggled to survive, LipService played to packed houses, bringing theatres much needed income and building an audience of dedicated fans who returned loyally, show after show, to savour their special brand of savvy silliness. Central to its success were Maggie’s riotously funny anarchic skills, consummate comic timing and instinctive talent for impromptu interaction with the audience. In the words of her fellow comic Helen Lederer, “Maggie was the funniest person in the room always.” Their shows were frequently witty literary spoofs. Many years before Mischief Theatre’s The Play That Goes Wrong, their affectionate satire Withering Looks gently sent up theatre itself, as it purportedly presented an “authentic look at the Brontës” – performed by a (barely) professional actor, played by Sue, and a willing volunteer (“I don’t even get my expenses”) played by Maggie. Premiered at the Green Room, Manchester, in 1988, it had sell-out runs at the Edinburgh fringe, where it won a critics award for comedy in 1992, before touring all over the world. It set the template for a series of spoofs that earned them the epithet “Britain’s favourite literary lunatics” from one national theatre critic. Taking aim at other “literary giants”, such as Conan Doyle in Move Over Moriarty (1996) or Louisa M Alcott in Very Little Women (2004), LipService were often actually targeting the popular culture versions of these classics, with their simplifications and sentimentality. A Picture of Doreen Gray (2014) and Mr Darcy Loses the Plot (2016) followed. Witty but never cruel or cynical, they extended their reach to take in popular culture genres, such as 007 in Jane Bond (2007), aga sagas in Women on the Verger (2000) and Scandi noir in Inspector Norse (2012). Many involved the audience in theatrical origami, knitting of props or – in the case of their celebration of Doris Day, Desperate to Be Doris (2009), ambitiously training up a new community choir at each venue. The duo were celebrated for cunning comic creativity with stuffed animal toys, surreal costumes, ridiculously fast change routines and dodgy cheapskate scenery. The artfully hammy playing, deliberately rickety set and gaudy costumes led an uncomprehending German producer once to decline to book the show on the grounds that audiences were “used to higher production values in Germany”. The middle child of Raymond Fox, a solicitor and chair of the board of York Theatre Royal, and Barbara von Thadden, a German of aristocratic lineage (who escaped from Russian captivity in Pomerania at the end of the second world war), the young Margaret rapidly showed her talent for performance, especially in comedy. She met Ryding, who was to become her lifelong onstage partner, at Bristol University in 1979, where they were both studying drama, finding laughs in a production of The Lady from the Sea that would have surprised Ibsen. From the outset, Maggie and Sue had the sort of chemistry that audiences who love Morecambe and Wise treasure and, like Eric Morecambe, Maggie had the gift of making audiences laugh uproariously just by walking on stage. With her huge, expressive eyes and her mobile face she was eloquent even without the aid of the duo’s invariably hilarious lines. Her incursions into television were rare, as she was so often on tour, but her role as Ruth Audsley in Coronation Street (in 2001), a woman who befriends Julie Hesmondhalgh’s Hayley Cropper; and her conflicted housekeeper Bilson, serving the saturnine Soames, played by Damian Lewis, in The Forsyte Saga (2002-03), were memorable performances. She also appeared in Shameless (2006) and South Riding (2011), and was the voice of the librarian in the 2003 Bob the Builder TV movie. But it was live theatre that was her passion and her triumph. LipService had a long relationship with the Library theatre in Manchester (now part of the Home arts centre), premiering many productions there. Recent shows by the duo encompassed a strong digital element and access for deaf and disabled audiences. At the time of Maggie’s death, LipService were in the middle of a tour of Chateau Ghoul, a new show developed from one they had created for online performance during lockdown. She is survived by her mother, Barbara, by the actor and academic Malcolm Raeburn, her partner since 1985 and husband since 2000, and by their daughters, the actor and director Vita Fox, the writer Imogen Fox and the actor Helena Fox.

4/8/2022,"There is something crucial missing from most true-crime podcasts: the voice of the victim. That is not true of Stories of the Stalked, a six-part Audible series from the award-winning film-maker and dancer Lily Baldwin. Having spent13 years being stalked, she has written and narrated an immersive series in which illusory sound design transports the listener into the midst of the experience. We join her in 2009, when she is touring the world as a backing dancer for the musician David Byrne. We hear bags hit the floor, curtains rolling up, music playing and crowds applauding. We are right there with her as the stalking starts with an email; we hear her log on to her computer and fall into confusion as she reads a sinister message from someone who had seen her in a show the week before. It goes into intimate detail about her performance, and the writer invites her to work for a company he is starting. Over five episodes, we hear about the next 13 years, with Baldwin’s stalker emailing, calling, messaging, sending parcels, and eventually hunting her down. At this point, she goes into hiding and changes her name; she is left facing lasting psychological distress. For legal reasons, and to ensure that her stalker doesn’t benefit in any way from the story, he is referred to as “X” throughout the podcast. Baldwin also interviews an intelligence expert in the first episode, revealing to the audience that “X” is still out there and Stories of the Stalked may be the catalyst for increased activity from him, which shows how her story – like many women’s – does not yet have an ending. “It was important to me to remove the sensationalism of the situation as much as possible,” she says, via Zoom from Los Angeles. “[I also didn’t want] the drama to be about the stalker, and what he did. The story needed to revolve around the emotional landscape.” Given the nature of true crime, Baldwin admits to doubts about that. “I was honestly nervous about a global audience of true-crime listeners listening; I wondered if it would even work [the way I wanted it to]. My worst fear was that I wouldn’t have control over the important areas of my story, especially when sharing it involved a very specific danger.” But Audible allowed Baldwin to keep control of her story from the start. Rather than making a podcast that fits with the typical imagery used to depict stalking of “shadowy figures and maybe a woman in heels or a miniskirt”, she has created something that challenges the way people think about stalking and who gets stalked. As the intelligence expert explains in the opening episode: “When people think of stalkers, they probably think of some young, strong, shadowy figure who hangs around in alleyways waiting for the perfect stranger. But the reality is very different. Many stalkers are charming and appear perfectly fine, even if they are very violent.” To tell her story, Baldwin had to relive a number of traumatic moments. She plunges herself back into the police reports she made, conversations with friends – and interactions with the perpetrator. “The whole process has been really intense and very triggering,” says Baldwin. “The podcast has been agonising to create, but it’s also how I’ve turned it into something bigger than myself. It’s a privilege to be in this position. I’m wary of complaining because I had support. Not everyone has that. “There was also catharsis that comes with the conversations that happen around it, hearing from survivors who are reaching out from all parts of the planet,” she says. It was important to Baldwin to capture these moments to illustrate how frightening it was to be stalked and show how terrifying an experience it is – even without the “add-on crimes” such as assault and domestic violence that can go with it. The email scene, in particular, shows how women are brought up not to trust their gut feelings (in the podcast she admits how “creepy” the letter initially felt, but she went against her instincts because of her conditioning as a woman to expect male attention), and how the visibility she had wanted as an artist became threatening. Stories of the Stalked manages something rare: it explores the “double-edged sword” of visibility with nuance. Baldwin, as an actor and dancer, is visible in an obvious, literal way. It’s her job to perform, in the way we understand typical “performance” to look and behave. But as she narrates, Baldwin draws interesting parallels between this and the more subtle performances of people’s everyday behaviour in the modern world. Whether it is the way we perform on social media or with others, people are oftenputting on a show, and the podcast illustrates how the same threat can lie beneath. “Visibility cultures are ancient and powerful, and today’s digital realms have heightened what is at stake,” she explains. This discomfort around visibility is partly why Baldwin chose to share this story as a podcast, despite having originally drafted it as a feature film or television series. “For so long, I’ve been a performer without a voice. And now I’m a voice without a body. I created this whole project in isolation and now, suddenly it’s out there. It’s such a personal story in such a public space without me being seen. I have this invisibility, protection.” Baldwin doesn’t want to accept that visibility will always be dangerous and has set up Stop Stalking Us, a nonprofit website where women can share their stories and that will advocate for legal changes in the US. “I want to carve out stalking as its own crime from domestic violence and sexual abuse. We don’t often talk about just stalking. It frequently gets tagged onto the horror of domestic and sexual abuse. But stalking is a unique kind of trauma.” It is also a particularly female kind of trauma. While people of all gender identities may be targeted, women experience stalking disproportionately, something Baldwin hopes her work might address. “I want women to keep engaging themselves and their bodies publicly, using cameras and digital platforms to communicate and express, to not feel guilty when someone says ‘you’re asking for it’. I want women to use the tools of today smartly, to not be blind or tentative, to not be afraid to admit they like being seen – but also to know when they are playing with fire, to trust their intuition, to set boundaries and ask for help,” she says. And what does Baldwin herself want to gain from Stories of the Stalked? “I made this podcast about my life – I’ve never done that before. I’m still exhaling from it. [I want] peace. Release,” she says. “The anger I’ve carried is just exhausting. I don’t have the answers to what ‘dealing with trauma’ means, but I want to maybe use the anger to mobilise myself into making a difference. To create a different relationship [with] my fear.” Given how good this podcast is, she is, hopefully, on the way to that.

4/8/2022,"Law enforcement in a rural northern California county that’s seen a major conflict over water rights stopped Asian drivers at vastly disproportionate rates compared to the county’s white population last year, in what civil rights groups have characterized as a pattern of “intentional discrimination” in the region. The ACLU and the Asian Law Caucus, two civil rights groups, obtained traffic stop data from the Siskiyou county sheriff’s office as part of an investigation into the county’s treatment of its Asian community – particularly Hmong Americans. Siskiyou county, a remote and sprawling swath near the Oregon border, has been locked in a months-long legal battle over extreme water restrictions. Officials have argued the county’s ban on transporting large amounts of water on certain roads is intended to protect groundwater and drive out illegal marijuana grows, which have become a major problem in the county in recent years. But Hmong Americans living in the region say the regulations cut off their access to water amid drought and a destructive fire season and that the rules are part of a broader pattern of discrimination and harassment by officials and law enforcement. The traffic stop records, which were obtained by the ACLU and the Asian Law Caucus, showed that though Asians make up just 2.6% of the population in the county, they accounted for 27.4% of all traffic stops in 2021 in which officials identified the people stopped. The data also shows that that more than 61% of the people the sheriff referred for prosecution for violations of the water ordinance were Asian American. Only 8% were white, though white people comprise 75% of the county’s population. “Based on the records produced by the county, it appears the sheriff rarely ever refers white people to the district attorney for violating the water transportation ordinance or water extraction ordinance,” the groups said in a brief filed with a federal court. John Do, a staff attorney with the ACLU, said his group spoke with dozens of residents of the subdivision who said they were stopped by police without a cause. “It is across the board,” he said. “All the data we’ve examined thus far indicates the targeting of the Asian community and the Hmong community.” The county’s water transportation restrictions are focused on the 1,600-plot Mount Shasta Vista subdivision, where more than 1,000 Hmong Americans live. The neighborhood lacks basic infrastructure and residents there say they rely on water hauled in from other areas. County officials, including the sheriff, have defended the water measures as an effective tool in a time of historic water shortages, alleging that the subdivision is rife with marijuana cultivation sites that dry up the land. The county sheriff, Jeremiah LaRue, told the Guardian in August there are close to 1,700 grows in the community. “We don’t target any people. We target crime. It’s unfortunate that is sort of the card that’s being played,” LaRue told the Guardian at the time. But residents say the county is singling out an entire community in their battle against pot growers, at a disastrous cost. Residents of the subdivision have said without water they were routinely dehydrated, could shower only once a week, struggled with depression and their animals died. Civil rights groups have said the restrictions amount to targeting of the county’s Hmong residents, an effort one attorney called “Jim Crow racism”. Last fall a federal judge temporarily blocked the county from enforcing the water laws, finding that they have the “practical effect of cutting off the water supply to a minority community that has recently been the target of racial prejudice”. Evidence supported claims that the county’s efforts were intended to force out people in the neighborhood, the judge wrote in a brief. Residents and civil rights organizations say the water restrictions come after years of discrimination against the ethnic minority. Hmong residents told the Guardian last year that when Hmong Americans first started moving to the area in 2015, stores sometimes refused to sell them basic goods, landlords declined to rent to them and neighbors flipped them off as they walked by. Law enforcement painted Hmong Americans as foreigners and criminals, the ACLU argued in its brief to the court, pointing to a 2017 comment from a former sheriff arguing it was “too bad” that the county’s Hmong American residents “didn’t use their ingenuity, intelligence and skills to engage in something lawful”. Last year, the sheriff’s office warned local businesses not to provide services or supplies, including soil, to “known illegal commercial cannabis sites”, and several people who live in Mount Shasta Vista said they were forced to buy water in secret from stores still willing to help them. The county sued two ranch owners for allegedly providing water to people in the neighborhood and accused them of selling groundwater to people growing marijuana illegally. “The sheriff don’t care about us. They just want to force us out of here. Even though we’re residents in this county, they still don’t care,” said Cheng Xiong, who lives in the Mount Shasta Vista neighborhood, last summer. The water laws have only further inflamed tensions, residents said. Several told the court last year that other Siskiyou residents have “brandished weapons at them, shot at their cars, stolen their belongings, told them to ‘go back where they came from,’” and threatened to burn down Mount Shasta Vista. Meanwhile, law enforcement has continued to treat Hmong American residents unfairly, said Glenn Katon with the Asian Law Caucus. “The injunction averted the humanitarian crisis that was taking place but the harassment and targeting has continued on a pretty huge scale,” he said. Do, with the ACLU, added that the sheriff office’s statements and actions have had a chilling effect on the community. The sheriff’s office and the county did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The county has asked the judge to lift the injunction on the water laws, and said it would enforce the laws in the entire county rather than in select areas.",News/US news,"Water, weed and racism: why Asians feel targeted in this rural California county",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/08/california-asian-discrimination-water-rights-siskiyou
4/8/2022,"Flights should be banned in continental Europe and car use banned in city centres to save energy and prevent Vladimir Putin profiting from fossil fuel sales, campaigners have said. It would be possible for Europe to quickly end its reliance on oil and gas from Russia by taking strong measures, according to a report by the climate adviser Mark Lynas, energy analyst Rauli Partanen, and energy and sustainability installations specialist Joris van Dorp. Policies include rationing, with everyone in Europe allowed the same minimum amount of energy to use, and limiting thermostats to 18C in winter. “The biggest problem is gas. In total last year Europe imported 155 billion cubic metres of gas from Russia,” the authors said. Critics of the EU’s oil and gas policy have pointed out that hydrocarbon sales are financing the war in Ukraine. Even the EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said recently: “We’ve given Ukraine nearly €1bn. That might seem like a lot but €1bn is what we’re paying Putin every day for the energy he provides us with. Since the start of the war, we’ve given him €35bn [£29bn], compared to the €1bn we’ve given Ukraine to arm itself.” The report’s authors said: “We conclude it is possible to eliminate Russian gas imports starting immediately in Europe. This will require an unprecedented level of European solidarity, a combination of a Marshall plan and a Berlin airlift to redistribute energy around the continent as needed and support the transition.” The International Energy Agency recently released a 10-point plan to reduce demand for oil use in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, with suggestions including subsidised public transport, lower speed limits and a reduction in business flights. The authors of the latest report, however, say such measures would reduce demand by 2.7m barrels a day in advanced economies, still substantially less than Russian oil exports to Europe. The authors argue that we need to go further, and say they have worked out how to eliminate 25% of all oil use in Europe. “We propose bans on all business flights, private jets and internal flights within Europe to save oil, and bans also on car use within cities,” they said. “This should be combined with free public transport. While the impacts of this are not easily quantified, we believe this could double the reduction in oil use beyond that proposed by the IEA.” To replace the gas Europe buys Russia, the authors recommend measures including stopping the nuclear phaseout in Germany, Sweden and Belgium, reducing heating in buildings by 4C, and a fast-track deployment of additional solar and wind generation. These policies could be popular in Europe. New polling conducted by Savanta ComRes found that 41% of people polled in the UK, Germany Poland, France, Sweden and the Netherlands said they “strongly agreed” that their country should immediately stop buying Russian oil and gas. Only 6.4% strongly disagreed. Just over 40% said they would be prepared to accept energy rationing to manage demand, and 52.7% that they would eat less meat to reduce demand on Ukrainian exports. “Europe is sending over €500m every day directly to the Kremlin because we continue to import vast quantities of Russian oil, gas and coal. This situation cannot continue,” the authors of the report said. “It is morally and politically untenable for Europe to fund Putin’s war machine – paying for the same missiles and bombs that are raining down on Ukrainian schools and hospitals – at the same time as supposedly uniting to stop Putin through sanctions. There is only one solution. We must cut off this torrent of money we are sending to the Kremlin by immediately stopping our imports of Russian fossil fuels.”",News/Environment,"Ban European flights and car use in cities to hurt Putin, report urges",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/08/slugs-ban-european-flights-cities-car-use-hurt-putin-russia-oil-gas-income-report

4/8/2022,"A few weeks ago, while scrolling Instagram and passing silent judgement on a stranger’s interior decoration choices, I was served an ad for Paired. The app promised “10 minutes a day to a better relationship” via quizzes designed by therapists and academics to spark more meaningful conversations. Had Alexa been eavesdropping on that row we had about the recycling? Either way, an algorithm had staged an intervention. At no other point in our history have we scrutinised our relationships so closely. Two years of semi-confinement in homes that doubled as co-working spaces or classrooms will do that. Across the cultural spectrum, via the BBC’s fly-on-the wall Couples Therapy, or Gwyneth and her wolverine claw in Netflix’s Sex, Love & Goop, we are hooked on psychoanalysing other people’s relationships. What Paired, Relish, Coupleness, Love Nudge (if you can look beyond the name) and a growing number of other couples’ apps are doing is turning that fascination inward. It’s relationship maintenance for the time-poor, self-care curious – and business is booming. “There has been a recalibration of priorities in terms of what we value, and that includes relationships,” says Jacqui Gabb of Paired, who is also professor of sociology and intimacy at the Open University. For all the predictions of a divorce boom, experts agree it’s too soon to tell. “Lots of media are reporting a huge spike in divorce,” she says, “but from the research I’ve seen, there hasn’t been one. Poor relationships have got worse, but good ones have got stronger.” What is clear is that we’re more prepared to “do the work”. A Tavistock Relationships YouGov poll in July 2021 found that 66% of people in relationships said they valued their partner more after navigating the pandemic together. Even for those who struggled – 18-24-year-olds were almost twice as likely (46%) than average to experience conflict with their partner during the pandemic – there was an awakening around relationship care, with Tavistock therapists reporting a rise in millennial and gen Z couples attending counselling for maintenance rather than crisis. “Unlike previous generations who ‘made their bed and lay in it’, couples are now saying, ‘Let’s make this healthy and as good as it can be’,” says Marian O’Connor, counsellor and psychosexual therapist at Tavistock Relationships. “The lockdowns gave us this proximity to our partners unlike anything before; it made people prepared to work on relationships. I also saw more couples prepared to work on splitting up more healthily.” For many, this is part of a wider self-care ethos that saw meditation app usage surge during the first lockdown. Headspace confirmed that UK downloads increased by 28% between March 2020 and March 2021, and downloads of Calm have doubled to more than a billion listens since the start of the pandemic. “Relationship care was the obvious next step,” agrees Gabb. “We have sex and relationships education as part of the school curriculum but then it falls off a cliff. We all think we know what makes a good relationship – based on what we see in parents, friends and the media – but people are starting to realise that you have to put the work in, every day.” But why look for problems, I ask O’Connor, if everything’s fine? “It’s an interesting point, and could lead people towards thinking there’s a problem when there isn’t,” she agrees. But although she wouldn’t recommend the apps to clients as an alternative to therapy, she says they could be useful for proactively avoiding it. “Look at them as ways to test compatibility, especially for new couples, or as a form of self-improvement, like yoga or running.” My husband Ron and I have fared comparatively well. Together for 10 years, married for five and with three children, we’ve landed in 2022 somewhere between our friends, who had something of a sexual epiphany (shagging between WFH Zoom meetings, apparently), and the couple who decided to part after 15 years and a building up a hefty therapy bill. I have oscillated wildly between clinging to him as though my very life depends on him (which in many ways it does, emotionally at least), to inventing increasingly implausible reasons to socially distance from him, if only to muffle the incessant sound of him crunching though packets of crisps. We’ve weathered grief, sickness, childbirth and dangerous levels of sleep deprivation, and there’s still nobody else I’d rather probe nasal cavities alongside. But after two soul-grinding pandemic years, is it time to take care of us? We decide to give an app a try. I can’t deny I’m cynical – do I really require a push notification to tell my husband that the colour of his T-shirt brings out his eyes? But I am intrigued by the premise of Paired, which was co-founded by former management consultant Kevin Shanahan, who previously worked on memory training and language-learning apps. It has grown from 1,000 monthly active users, pre-pandemic, to more than 500,000. I download the app at £49.99 for premium access (it has a free seven-day trial) and try not to think about the half-decent pub lunch we could have had for that. Ron, not naturally inclined to self-examination, is less convinced. I spend the next two days telling him to “Pair” with me before grabbing his phone and installing the app myself, which speaks volumes about our communication style. “You have to answer some questions about me online,” I say. “Can’t I just tell you to your face?” he responds, missing my point but making a valid one himself. Each morning at 7am, Paired pings us a question. Day one: “How do you and your partner interact when you first wake up?” Paired tells me that research found couples who say “Good morning” to one another every day rate their satisfaction levels higher than those who don’t. I fire off something about whoever hears the baby first drags themselves out of bed, and wonder if my satisfaction levels would be higher without the 7am alarm call. We spend the next week batting answers to one another. Day three: “What’s the best surprise you’ve ever received?” The app tells me that surprises, according to “surprisologist” (me neither) Tania Luna, provide the perfect combination of stability and novelty we crave in a relationship. My answer was a Californian road trip that Ron only told me about when we arrived at the airport. His was the positive pregnancy test I presented when we were expecting baby no 3. I suspect he’s confusing “surprise” with “shock”, but maybe both answers represent the craving for novelty (me) and the need for stability (him) that make us tick as a couple. I learn the worst way to resolve an argument (over text) and that Ron thinks I am a medium-happy-face good listener (the app delivers results in emoji), whereas for me it’s a straight-mouthed neutral. He also thinks I’d be happiest on a beach with a cocktail, whereas I answer on a snowboard in the mountains. In fairness, I’d take either right now. On a more reassuring note, we’re aligned on the big stuff, like parenting, money and whether we would rather be a dog or a cat. In addition to the daily questions, Paired serves up twice-weekly quizzes designed to prompt meaningful offline conversations. Topics range from communication style and handling conflict to preparing for tough times, with the odd “would you rather?” thrown in for a joke (for example: would you rather give up coffee or social media?). The results help identify challenges and prompt you into discussion. Enticingly, you don’t get to see your partner’s answers to the same questions until you have completed the quiz yourself. Our first red flag is during an “active listening quiz”, when we are asked how strongly we agree with the statement: “I let my partner speak without interruption.” The result is a matching sad face, so the app instructs us to discuss. I hold my hands up, aware that interrupting is the trait I most deplore in myself. It turns out Ron feels the same about his own argument style. Next time we’re in disagreement (over where to put a cupboard), I take a breath before putting my case across, and notice he does the same. For all its gimmicks, Paired is steeped in science. For every question posed, you’re given a research-backed reason why it’s relevant. “What’s the question that strangers ask you the most?”, for example, is a way to share your “inner world” (hopes and dreams) with your partner, which, according to the app and renowned US psychologist Dr John Gottman, helps couples connect during stressful times instead of becoming strangers. My answer was: “Nice coat. Where from?” Ron’s was: “Which way to the train station?” I’m not sure this reveals much more than that he’s a reliable-looking guy and I have impeccable taste in outerwear. The app is backed by an impressive lineup of therapists, clinical psychologists and academics, led by Gabb, who also authored the Open University’s much-cited Enduring Love study, delving into how long-term relationships are sustained. The findings placed non-heterosexual, unmarried couples without children as the most satisfied with their relationship quality, while married, heterosexual parents languish somewhere near the bottom of the contentment ladder. Relatable, I think, as I chisel a two-day-old Cheerio off the kitchen floor with a butter knife. The more heartening aspect of Gabb’s study is that it isn’t big gestures but small, daily wins that can sustain a partnership – saying “thank you” or “I love you”, sharing the household chores and, top of the list, making your other half a cup of tea. And this is the foundation on which Paired sits, and informs the app’s questions. It works, in some ways. Had we not been forced to cast our minds back to distant, pre-pandemic adventures (via the “Describe a perfect evening together” prompt), we might not have found ourselves laughing on the sofa about an unrepeatable incident from our first date. We would have been watching Netflix instead. “It didn’t teach me anything new,” was Ron’s verdict by the end of the trial. “But it did reaffirm how lucky we are, and that we really need a holiday. Plus I could do it all with one eye on Peaky Blinders.” After two weeks of doing Paired, the daily questions lost their novelty and I disabled the 7am notifications, but I had secretly enjoyed cornering Ron into revealing nuggets of his inner world. On his biggest fear, I already knew his answer (something awful happening to me or the children), but did it sting when he answered that he prefers to deal with his fears “alone”? A little. Perhaps the most revelatory thing was the “Looking back on 2021” quiz. It didn’t tell us anything new, but it did spark a conversation that made us reflect on a year of cancelled dates, hijacked calendars and work/childcare schedules thrashed out through gritted teeth. We’ve always been good at talking about the Big Things, but it’s a timely reminder to sweat the small stuff, too – a cup of tea, knowing your favourite snack, a silent hug when you need it most and, sure, a heated debate over “would you rather” travel by helicopter or hot-air balloon. A few days later, a text pings in from my husband: “Leaving now. I’ll get cheese.” I think we’ll be fine. The app Relish (£94.99 for six months, free seven-day trial) The deal Relationship coaching to build better connection, communication and intimacy in five minutes a day, via daily quizzes and prompts. The couple Tineka, 35, and Alex, 33, have been married for seven years, together for 10, and have a two-month-old son. Tineka says We got into the quizzes, with questions like: “If you could have a million of something, excluding money, what would it be?”. They take two minutes and it’s kind of exciting waiting for your partner’s responses. It turns out Alex thinks I’m a better listener than I think I am. I also learned to appreciate his pauses – he’s thinking, not zoning out. The app reaffirmed that we’re aligned on parenting and our future, which we talk about a lot anyway (we wrote a book together about being in an interracial relationship). The text-heavy lessons, such as one on active listening, were too time-consuming but we will use the date-night-at-home suggestions, like taco night and recreating a hotel stay in the bedroom. That would have been handy in lockdown! Alex says I had no idea Tineka wanted to go to Barbados; it’s never come up before. I liked being asked daily how I feel about Tineka – it takes two seconds to answer with an emoji, which beats our usual transactional conversations about the baby. Last year forced us to have some challenging conversations about race and about parenting, and I learned so much from Tineka. I didn’t need an app for that, but it reminded me to keep investing in the most important relationship I have, instead of doomscrolling social media.*** The app Coupleness (£31.99 a year or £11.99 a month, with a number of free functions) The deal A digital micro-journal for couples to log, share and track their feelings in three minutes a day, using emojis and gifs. The couple Laura, 39, and Julie, 40, have been together for 14 years. They have two children. Laura says It’s a cute, quick way to show love and reflect on how you’re feeling by asking you to rate your day from one to 10 in emoji faces. Jules didn’t always receive my love back because she turned off her notifications. The app is quite naggy; you get multiple notifications a day. I misunderstood a question about listing three great qualities about your partner and listed loads, but Jules only received the last three, pretty unromantic ones – calm, talkative and social. Turns out she thinks I’m “handy”, of all things, so that’s nice. It was a good conversation starter. One day the app told me she’d had a bad day at work (I got sent a sad face) so we talked about it that night and came up with an action plan that we might not have otherwise. Julie says Laura can do anything – cooking, DIY – so in response to being asked her three best qualities, I said that she was handy, which may not have gone down well. You have to be careful because options for answers are very black and white (happy or sad) with little room for context, so if you log that your partner gave you a sad face one day, you need to follow it up with a face-to-face explainer to avoid misinterpretation or a tiff, which I guess is the whole point of the app. It’s useful for giving each other a heads-up about a rubbish day before you get home. I think we’ll use it more when we go back to the office and see less of each other.*** The app Love Nudge (free) The deal Based on the principles of US author Gary Chapman’s bestseller, The Five Love Languages, the habit-forming app identifies your “love language” – how you express and experience love (touch, words of affirmation, quality time, acts of service or receiving gifts) – then “nudges” you with a prompt to help you each express love in ways that speak your partner’s language. The couple Danielle, 35, and Robert, 37, have been together for 10 years and have two children. Danielle says I’m very tactile, so wasn’t surprised that my love language is 87% “touch” (the app loves a stat), but Robert got “words of affirmation”, which was interesting. He’s a man of few words who doesn’t delve into his feelings, so it was nice to hear that what he does say holds a lot of value. The app doesn’t share your answers with your partner, so it was nice to give him that personal space. Robert put his arm around me this morning and said: “I love you.” I asked him: “Did you get a nudge?” He just laughed. Robert says I don’t even like social media so this was a stretch for me. It was a quick, easy way to carve out time for one another by asking you to do one thing a day for your partner, such as hold their hand or give them a compliment. A lot of the questions were black and white – you either like gifts or holding hands – which doesn’t allow for nuance. The videos of cartoon figures that make noises were a bit childish and I felt like I was watching CBeebies. I work away for three-week stints and we speak four times a day and WhatsApp constantly – I much prefer that to communicating in emojis.

4/8/2022,"It was supposed to be a safe space for LGBTQ+ people. Then someone set the nightclub on fire while they were still inside. Rash, a five-month-old queer bar and nightclub in New York’s Bushwick, was leveled by a blaze on Sunday night, injuring two people in what police are investigating as an intentional act. About 9.20pm, before a show was about to begin, a man entered the venue, poured a bottle of flammable liquid on the floor, lit a match and ran out as a blaze ignited, police said. Two people were hospitalized with burns, and have since been released. Jake Sillen, Rash’s 26-year-old co-owner, said that the venue was not yet full when the fire started. “It could’ve been a lot worse if it was in the middle of the event,” Sillen told the Guardian. But the bar has been “completely charred on the inside” and will need to be demolished. Rash was a relative newcomer along the Myrtle Avenue strip, a popular nightlife district in Bushwick, a historically Hispanic and industrial part of Brooklyn.The club saw itself as a launchpad for up-and-coming acts, especially queer artists who “maybe hadn’t had bookings like this before, haven’t performed at this scale before”, said Sillen. Before it burned, the club was organizing seven shows a week, some shows with up to six DJs. “It’s possible some weeks we were paying 30 to 40 performers,” the co-owner said. Now many of those performers could lose work. “There’s a whole community and ecosystem that relies on this place, and I don’t know what all these people are going to be able to do without it.” Sillen said that they’re determined to rebuild the venue. But their current priority is to raise money to help with the victims’ medical costs on GoFundMe, where a statement from Rash called the fire “a cruel act of violence”. Terri Moise, a 27-year-old resident of Bushwick who lives five blocks from Rash and frequently saw shows there, said he felt “heartbroken” and shaken after the fire. Moise said that Rash had felt like a “genuinely very, very safe space for queer people of color. They were really good about making sure people weren’t harassing anyone. Everyone there was super friendly. The bartenders, the security – if they even got a hint of someone not feeling well, they would go check on them immediately.” Despite its short existence, Rash had become quickly embraced as a go-to spot for young queer partiers. It had a dimly lit back room that was able to create “a large rave feeling at a small venue – very hard to accomplish,” said Moise. Rash was among one of several well-known queer-friendly venues in the area, including Mood Ring, Happyfun Hideaway, and the Bossa Nova Civic Club. But even before the fire at Rash, some clubbers were already on edge. Last August, another Brooklyn queer bar, C’Mon Everybody, had a brick thrown through its window. In September, there was a stabbing at Bossa Nova that injured a 43-year-old man and rattled partygoers. Afterward, the nightclub announced it had “updated [its] security protocol.” In January, Bossa Nova was heavily damaged and forced to shut down when a fire started in an apartment above it, seriously injuring the tenant and killing the tenant’s dog. That fire was not deemed suspicious by investigators, but the closure left a void in Bushwick’s queer clubbing scene. Then in February, Nowadays, in neighboring Queens, was hit by what appeared to be a mace bomb, burning attendees’ eyes and throats at a club night that celebrated its all-Black DJ lineup. After Bossa Nova closed, many artists that had performed there started doing shows at Rash, which was vocal in calling for support of Bossa Nova on social media. Rash’s co-owner Sillen said they didn’t want to draw conclusions about the attack yet, but acknowledged there were “definitely a lot” of other recent troubling incidents in the area. Bossa Nova Civic Club did not return the Guardian’s requests for comment. With one of the largest LGBTQI populations in the world, New York City has long been a global mecca for queer culture. Bars, dance halls and nightclubs have played an important role as a space for the community to express itself without fear. They have also been the birthplace of art, music, fashion, and political movements that have had an outsized impact on the rest of popular culture. This week, New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams, positioned the city as a welcoming place for queer people in contrast to places like Florida, where Governor Ron DeSantis just signed a “don’t say gay” law. The policy prohibits teaching students between kindergarten and third grade about gender identity and sexual orientation. “We are going to loudly show our support, to say to those who are living in Florida, ‘Listen, we want you here in New York. Want you right here in New York City,’” said Adams at a press conference Monday. “We are in unison with you and your right to have a self-identification, your right to live the lifestyle, live the life that you choose to live, without any form of harassment.” The mayor tweeted on Tuesday after the fire at Rash: “While this incident is still being investigated, make no mistake: anyone who comes into my city looking to spread fear and hatred will pay the consequences.” Queer spaces have faced violence for as long as they have existed. New York City’s most well-known incident is the police raid at Stonewall Inn that sparked the 1969 Stonewall Uprising – and helped launch the modern gay rights movement. There have been countless other incidents since in New York and around the country. But attacks won’t deter Sillen from continuing. While live music, dance music, and nightlife culture “can get a bad rap for being dangerous or indulgent,” the scene is “really, really important” to the queer community, they said. “It’s one of the only places that some of these people can exist, and do what they love to do, and be themselves.” ",News/US news,Suspected arson attack strikes at heart of New York’s queer-friendly club scene,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/08/new-york-queer-club-rash-suspected-arson-attack
4/8/2022,"Extinction Rebellion has said it will conduct its most disruptive protest yet in the streets of London over the coming week, calling for an end to the fossil fuel economy. The environmental activist group, which encourages supporters to cause disruption through non-violent civil disobedience, will return to the city from Saturday with new tactics it claims will “create the most roadblocks we ever have”. It has told supporters to book the week off work and meet in Hyde Park on Saturday morning, promising them “a simple unstoppable rebellion design” that will “facilitate a mass flood of people to grind the capital to a halt”. Some actions have already begun. At 7am on Friday, activists blocked Tower Bridge, with two people hanging from the bridge by suspension cords and others hanging a huge banner over its side demanding: “End fossil fuels now.” XR said in a statement: “The action has taken place at the gateway to the City of London – the root source of fossil fuel funding in the UK – and on the eve of the April rebellion which begins tomorrow at 10am in Hyde Park.” Since 1 April, XR activists have also been staging blockades at an Esso distribution terminal in west London, as part of the Just Stop Oil campaign. XR described those actions as “a preface” to mass protests it has planned over this weekend and next week. “We will return to the streets day after day until our immediate demand – for the UK government to immediately end all new fossil fuel investments – is met,” the group said in a recent statement. It has called on supporters to make sure they are free until 17 April, making this “rebellion” shorter than the previous fortnights of protest the group has staged, but organisers say they hope to return to the streets on subsequent weekends. Since 2018, XR has staged four extended campaigns of disruptive protest in the streets of London, calling for the government to take action on the climate and biodiversity crises. The group has enjoyed successes in inspiring a range of spin-off movements and raising awareness of and concern about environmental issues among the general public to hitherto unseen levels. But each time protesters have returned to the streets en masse the impact of their actions has diminished, as police have learned to suppress their blockades of bridges and key junctions. And, as with many social movements, the long interregnum of the Covid pandemic and its curbs on social interaction also hampered XR’s ability to organise. XR organisers are hoping a new strategy will enable them to evade police and again cause major disruption in London. Attempts to take and hold road junctions with large pieces of protest infrastructure, which police had learned to quickly isolate and remove, will be swapped for more mobile and adaptable blockades. “We are not going to be coming in with huge objects necessarily, but the plan is to get lots of people to hold areas using their bodies, staying in roads and holding spaces,” said an XR source. “We are going to try to be really mobile as well.” There would be “people moving around and trying to hold the space, holding spaces that are particularly disruptive and doing direct actions … We want to be movable so we can go to different areas if we want to. “We want to be super-mobile and hard to pin down, but we also want it to be really inclusive, easy to find and get involved.” Breaking the law and being arrested is also likely to remain a core tactic. In posts on the messaging app Telegram to supporters, XR tells them to bring burner phones and bustcards with solicitors’ telephone numbers, and to leave ID at home. As well as the oil terminal actions, groups affiliated to XR have already begun campaigns this week. On Wednesday, scientists and academics with Scientists Rebellion threw fake oil over the London headquarters of Shell, while on Thursday, Doctors for XR blocked the road outside HM Treasury in Westminster. On Thursday morning, Juliette Brown, a 51-year-old psychiatrist from London, who was sat in the road by St James’s Park outside the government department, said: “We know that the climate and ecological crisis is a health crisis. Global warming [and] air pollution are largely driven by the burning of fossil fuels. “The government declared a climate emergency, yet they are still considering licensing new oil and gas fields [and] financing fossil fuels through tax breaks despite the clear evidence and advice from experts that we need to end all new fossil fuel investment immediately.”",News/Environment,Extinction Rebellion vows fossil fuels protest will ‘grind London to a halt’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/08/extinction-rebellion-fossil-fuels-protest-grind-london-halt
4/8/2022,"Hello and good morning, Ukraine’s state railway company has said more than 30 people have been killed and more than 100 were wounded after two Russian rockets struck Kramatorsk station in east Ukraine. The Donetsk governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said thousands of civilians were at the station trying to evacuate to safer areas of Ukraine when it was hit, before an anticipated major offensive. Moscow’s six-week incursion has forced more than 4 million people to flee abroad, killed or injured thousands, turned cities into rubble and led to sweeping sanctions on Russian leaders and companies. In a symbolic move, the United Nations general assembly suspended Russia from the UN human rights council yesterday, expressing “grave concern at the ongoing human rights and humanitarian crisis”. Russia then quit the council. It came as the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, foreshadowed the emergence of more atrocities, saying the situation in the town of Borodianka was “much more disastrous” than in Bucha – where authorities have said hundreds of civilians were found dead. Meanwhile, Germany’s foreign intelligence service has reportedly intercepted radio transmissions in which Russian soldiers appear to talk about carrying out premeditated civilian killings in Ukraine. Russia gave the most somber assessment so far of its invasion of Ukraine yesterday, describing the “tragedy” of mounting troop losses and the economic blow from sanctions. “We have significant losses of troops,” the Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, told Sky News. “It’s a huge tragedy for us.” What’s going on in Mariupol? More than 100,000 people are still believed to be trapped in the besieged southern port city. Pro-Russian authorities said about 5,000 people had been killed and 60-70% of the housing stock at least partially destroyed. What’s the situation in Kyiv? Russian forces have pulled back from around the Ukrainian capital in recent days and are believed to be regrouping to focus on conquering the Donbas in the east. Lithuania’s ambassador to Ukraine returned to the capital yesterday, becoming one of the few diplomats to return. What happened in Dmytrivka? Soldiers fighting for Ukraine appeared to shoot a Russian prisoner of war outside the village west of Kyiv in a video posted online, a potential war crime. In the video, at least three men in camouflage, including one with a head wound and his hands tied behind his back, can be seen lying dead next to a fourth man, who is breathing heavily, and is shot multiple times. Ketanji Brown Jackson, a liberal appeals court judge, was confirmed to the supreme court yesterday, overcoming a rancorous Senate approval process and earning bipartisan approval to become the first Black woman to serve as a justice on the high court. Responding to her confirmation, politicians and activists kept coming back to one word: “joy”. “I feel immense pride and so much joy at this historic occasion,” said Senator Cory Booker. It’s a “historic moment for our nation”, said President Joe Biden. Jackson, who serves on the US court of appeals for the DC circuit, will replace Stephen Breyer, 83, the most senior member of the court’s liberal bloc. Breyer, for whom Jackson clerked early in her legal career, said he intended to retire this summer. At 51, Jackson is young enough to serve on the court for decades. Her ascension, however, will do little to tilt the ideological balance of the high court. But it does mean for the first time in the court’s history that white men are in the minority. Why is her confirmation so historic? In the supreme court’s more than 200-year history a Black woman has never before served as a justice. What was the Senate voting tally? 53 to 47, with all Democrats in favor. They were joined by three moderate Republicans, senators Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. What does it mean for the court’s ideological balance? The supreme court will still be bent 6-3 towards conservatives over liberals. The House select committee investigating the January 6 attack appears to believe it included a coordinated assault perpetrated by the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys militia groups that sought to physically stop the certification of Biden’s election victory. The panel’s working theory crystallized this week after obtaining evidence of the coordination in testimony and non-public video, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The panel has amassed deep evidence about the connections between the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys in recent weeks after it obtained hours of footage of the leaders of the militia groups in Washington before the Capitol attack, the sources said. Most crucially for the panel, the new information forms part of the evidence to connect the militia groups that stormed the Capitol on 6 January to the organizers of the Save America rally that immediately preceded the attack – who in turn are slowly being linked to the Trump White House. The Syrian government has seized more than $1.5bn worth of personal property – including cars, olive groves, shops, houses, electronics and jewellery – from citizens accused of joining anti-government protests, according to a rights group. The seizures have been condemned as “akin to a revenge or scare tactic”. US authorities arrested a yakuza leader on charges of plotting to distribute heroin and methamphetamine in the US and purchase weapons – including US-made missiles – for rebels in Myanmar. New York prosecutors said Takeshi Ebisawa was a leader of the Japanese crime syndicate. Akshata Murty, the UK chancellor Rishi Sunak’s wife, has potentially avoided up to £20m ($26m) in UK tax by being technically non-domiciled despite living in Downing Street. Yesterday’s reports pile further pressure on the couple. Murty gets about £11.5m a year in dividends from a stake in an Indian IT firm. The Omicron Covid variant causes different symptoms from Delta, a study published in the Lancet has found. The Omicron wave was linked to an average 6.9 days of symptoms, compared with 8.9 when Delta dominated, with fewer people losing their sense of smell and more experiencing a sore throat. Abu Dhabi appears to have facilitated payments to Manchester City soccer club, according to emails published by Der Spiegel. The reporting has reignited the controversy that led to the club in 2020 receiving a ban from the European Champions League that was ultimately overturned at the court of arbitration for sport. Big cities in California spent large portions of their federal Covid relief money on police departments, public records show. Money from both Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act (Arpa) and Trump’s Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (Cares) Act flowed to the police. Los Angeles spent roughly 50% of its first round of Arpa relief funds on the LAPD. Fresno spent $36.6m of its Cares funds on the police, making up 67% of Cares spending on city salaries. San Jose allocated about $27.8m of its Cares and Arpa funds to the police. Lost revenue, accusations of hate speech, the previously unimaginable spectacle of Vladimir Putin declaring that he knows how JK Rowling feels: what a volatile climate to release the latest Harry Potter spin-off movie, writes Ryan Gillbey. But how did the franchise lose its magic? The most deleterious effect on the Wizarding World has been caused not so much by lacklustre product – Fantastic Beasts still has fans in abundance – but by Rowling herself. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and Eddie Redmayne have all distanced themselves publicly from the Harry Potter author and declared their solidarity with trans people. The future of Fantastic Beasts is uncertain. About 15 million American homes are at risk of flooding and sea levels are rising. The US is experiencing a migration crisis, Max Ufberg writes in a powerful dispatch on the people affected, and yet even after a deluge of warnings there is no centralized lifeline for coastal communities. Mendoza, a 35-year-old mother of three, was forced to move from the flood-prone area where she grew up and where most of her family resides. “This was mine,” she tells Ufberg, returning to her vandalized former home. “I had my bed here.

4/8/2022,"On 19 May 1924, the cellist Beatrice Harrison performed an extraordinary duet with a singing nightingale in her Surrey garden in one of the BBC’s first live outside broadcasts. It was a magical nocturnal event that captivated the nation, inspiring a million listeners, tens of thousands of fan letters and repeat broadcasts every year until 1942. But now the corporation is acknowledging that the original historic event was in fact faked up using a bird impressionist – someone imitating a nightingale so accurately that people have believed a real one was responding to a rendition of the Londonderry Air. Nightingales may have been scared off by the crew trampling around the garden with heavy recording equipment. As this was live, the back-up plan was an understudy – thought to have been Maude Gould, a whistler or siffleur known as Madame Saberon on variety bills. The BBC says the “true story” will be explored in a forthcoming Radio 3 programme, Private Passions, to be broadcast on 17 April. It will feature Prof Tim Birkhead, one of the world’s leading experts on birds, who told the Guardian: “It would [have been] a terrible admission, even later, to say that they’d wheeled in Madame Saberon. The temptation to not say anything must’ve been immense. Today, that would be unacceptable but, in 1924, it was probably perfectly acceptable.” Harrison was one of the leading cellists of her generation, inspiring Elgar and Delius. She liked to practise outdoors and recalled her first duet with a nightingale: “I began the Chant Hindu by Rimsky-Korsakov and, after playing for some time, I stopped. Suddenly a glorious note echoed the notes of the cello. I then trilled up and down the instrument, up to the top and down again … The voice of the bird followed me … It seemed a miracle.” She persuaded Lord Reith, the BBC’s director-general, to broadcast such a performance. Initially reluctant, he later accepted that the nightingale “has swept the country … with a wave of something closely akin to emotionalism”. Harrison, dubbed “The Lady of the Nightingales”, recalled that after a long wait “suddenly, at about quarter to 11, the nightingale burst into song as I continued to play”. For the public, she realised, it “touched a chord in their love of music, nature and loveliness”. Birkhead, an emeritus professor of zoology at the University of Sheffield, is an award-winning scientist whose books include Birds and Us, a 12,000-year history of our relationship with birds. He said the nightingale’s song had “incredible volume and long, complex phrases”, and that playing any instrument outside was likely to draw a response: “I keep canaries. If I put the radio on, they all burst into song because there’s ‘a competitor’. It doesn’t matter that it’s not another canary. This is just ‘who the hell is this? Let’s out-sing them.’” He acknowledged research into the 1924 recording by Jeremy Mynott, who wrote in his 2009 book, Birdscapes: “I do wonder if it is really a nightingale at all.” Birkhead said that Mynott had played the recording to fellow experts: “One said it sounded very odd and one said it sounded OK. But when they looked at the sonogram, the sound picture, they did notice that it contained unusual elements … “I also played it to good birdwatchers, without telling them why. Half of them said: ‘yes, it’s a nightingale’, the other half said: ‘not sure, something funny about that song’. But I’m convinced that it was Madame Saberon.” Robert Seatter, the head of BBC History, told the Guardian: “The extraordinary story of the duet … has captivated people for decades … This revelation that a ‘siffleur’ may have sung the nightingale’s part in the original first broadcast is testimony to how precarious live broadcasts were almost a century ago … This version of events brings a new chapter to this much-loved story.” Birkhead said: “When Harrison repeated the performance in subsequent years, the BBC were a bit more careful about trampling through a garden and it was a real nightingale. That was the essence of it, that they’d scared it away.” Nightingales are in such steep decline, due to the climate crisis and lost habitats, that Harrison and the BBC would today have to wait indefinitely for one to turn up. Birkhead said: “The loss of bird life is immense: 600 million birds fewer in Europe since in 1980.” In Private Passions, he celebrates birdsong, choosing recordings ranging from the old Catalan “Song of the Birds” to the Dawn Chorus. Ask anyone to name the bird with the most beautiful song, and most will say the nightingale. While they are a brown, unassuming little bird, their haunting tune has made them the subject of countless poems and other works of art over the years. The song of a nightingale sounds complex because it is made up of far more sounds than those of its competitors. They can produce more than 1,000 different sounds, compared with just 340 by skylarks and about 100 by blackbirds. Their quest for love is also well known, with males singing their hearts out in order to find a mate. They are often found near still water, which they sing across on spring nights: the water carries their voice well, and they seem to like the effect. In Victorian times, when much of the poetry about the captivating little birds was written, many fancied the idea of having their very own nightingale, kept in a cage, ready and willing to sing to them. But they have such a strong migratory urge that come autumn the trapped bird would inevitably dash itself against the bars, dying in the process. While we are no longer inflicting this torture on the nightingale, they are suffering in this country for other reasons. The birds have faced a decline in England of at least 50% since 1995. In 2015, it became a red-listed species for the first time, making it a bird of conservation concern in the UK. This is thought to be because the scrubby little areas of bramble they like to sing from and nest in have been “tidied up” over the decades. Populations have been found to recover when thoughtful landowners have coppiced woodland, to create the low-lying bushes and small trees the birds enjoy. The Knepp Estate in Sussex is a good example of this – they have managed to tempt a little population back by creating the ideal habitat.

4/8/2022,"Staff at a hotel were uneasy about the behaviour of Koci Selamaj and called the police hours before he murdered Sabina Nessa, but officers failed to attend, it has emerged. On the day of the killing, Selamaj, 36, a petrol station worker who lived in Eastbourne, booked a £300-£400 room at the Grand hotel in the seaside town, where his wife, Ionela, worked. His wife had left him weeks previously owing to domestic abuse, including “throttling” her at least three times, detectives said. After he booked the room, Selamaj propositioned his wife for sex, which she refused. Hotel staff, knowing that Selamaj lived nearby, were uneasy at the booking and called 101 to alert police, detectives said. But Sussex police did not dispatch any officers. Selamaj later drove from Eastbourne to Kidbrooke, in south-east London, a suburb he is believed not to have visited before, where he battered and strangled Nessa, 28, a primary school teacher who was a stranger to him, as she walked through Cator Park to meet a friend at about 8.30pm on 17 September last year. Metropolitan police detectives described it as a “pre-meditated, sexually motived murder”. Selamaj pleaded guilty in February to the murder. DCI Neil John said: “We have an individual who booked this hotel on the 17th. We know from speaking to his partner that he had asked her to meet in the car during the day of the 17th at the Grand hotel where he propositioned her for a sexual encounter. She obviously said no.” Detectives said staff grew concerned after Selamaj was asked to pay for the hotel room. DS Mark Johnson said: “A member of the hotel staff called 101 ... They were a bit uneasy about him. They knew he lived close by so there was something not quite right about him.” DCI John said: “The hotel staff was uncomfortable about his demeanour. They just weren’t comfortable. He was questioning and querying why they wanted him to pay now.” Explaining Sussex’s police’s decision not to attend, John added: “Police can’t go to everything. The police operator did the right thing as in that moment there was no cause for any great concern. The operator informed the staff that the call had been reported, and if there was more cause for concern to call the police back and they would reassess.” Sussex police said: “Police were contacted about 4.40pm on Friday 17 September to reports of a disagreement between a man and staff at a hotel in Eastbourne earlier in the day, around the payment of a room. The matter was resolved and police were not required to attend.” Nessa was hit an estimated 34 times with a metal traffic warning triangle that Selamaj chose to use after buying a rolling pin in Sainsbury’s, before she was strangled. Her body was discovered 24 hours later covered with grass near a community centre in the park. Her underwear was missing, her dress pulled up and her bra exposed. On Thursday, the Old Bailey heard how Selamaj arrived back at the hotel at midnight after killing Nessa and checked out the following morning. Selamaj’s wife told police she had left him weeks before. “The wife was spoken with and she revealed that there was domestic violence in that relationship,” John said. “Part of that domestic violence had involved up to three occasions where she was throttled at the neck. None of that had been reported to the police. “When we spoke to her, she was very upset, very delicate, as you can imagine, finding out what her husband has done. She has now gone back to Romania. It’s had such a huge impact on her that she has decided to return home.” Through automatic number plate recognition cameras, detectives were able to track Selamaj’s return to Eastbourne via Kent. The murder weapon was found in the Teise River in Kent but no forensic evidence could be retrieved. Officers said of his motive that it would be speculation to attribute it to his wife leaving him. “When he was cautioned he said ‘what would happen if I open up now?’ That’s the only thing he has said to the police all throughout the investigation.”",News/UK news,Concerned hotel staff called police hours before Sabina Nessa murder,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/08/concerned-hotel-staff-called-police-hours-before-sabina-nessa
4/8/2022,"Koci Selamaj, 36, has been jailed at the Old Bailey for life with a minimum term of 36 years for the murder of the primary school teacher Sabina Nessa. Before the sentencing, Nessa was described as a kind, funny and innocent animal lover. On Thursday – day one of the two-day sentencing hearing – her parents, Abdur Rouf and Azibun Nessa, said: “You would never have thought that your child would die before you, not in a way our Sabina died.” Addressing Selamaj in a statement read to the court by the prosecutor, they said: “You had no right to take her away from us in such a cruel way. The moment the police officer came to our house and told us she was found dead our world shattered into pieces. “How could you do such a thing to an innocent girl walking by, minding her own business? You are not a human being, you are an animal.” Nessa’s sister Jabina Islam called Selamaj a “coward” after he refused to come to court on Thursday. She called her sister an “amazing role model” who was “powerful, fearless, bright and just an amazing soul” who deserved to be safe as she walked through the park on the night she died. Nessa’s body was found in Cator Park, in the Kidbrooke area of south-east London, on 18 September last year. The body of the year 1 teacher at Rushey Green primary school in Catford was found covered with leaves near a community centre in the park. She was killed while on her way to meet a friend in a bar the night before. The court heard Selamaj, who has a history of domestic violence, drove to London from Eastbourne, in East Sussex, to carry out the killing. The prosecutor, Alison Morgan QC, said the attack was “premeditated, not in the sense that he targeted Sabina Nessa but because it targeted any lone female”. Having happened upon Nessa as she walked home, the garage worker severely beat her, before killing her by asphyxiation and making a cursory attempt to conceal her body, the court heard. Morgan said: “This was a murder involving sexual or sadistic conduct.” While an earlier hearing was told a pathology report had uncovered no positive evidence of a sexual assault, the prosecution said other physical evidence – none of which was disputed by the defendant – demonstrated a “sexual motivation that must have existed”. Morgan said that, before travelling to London to carry out his attack, Selamaj met his former spouse and tried unsuccessfully to get her to have sex with him in his car. He also checked into a room at the Eastbourne hotel, near his home, in which his former wife worked, behaviour the prosecutor suggested was “indicative of his premeditation to have some kind of sexual encounter that evening”. It has also emerged that police were called hours before the killing when he got into a dispute with staff about payment for the room. However, Sussex police said “the matter was resolved and police were not required to attend”. In the absence of any explanation from Selamaj himself, the prosecution invited the court to conclude his motivation had been sexual during the first day of sentencing. Questioned by the judge, Selamaj’s lawyer, Lewis Power QC, said his client offered no challenge to the prosecution’s case. Asked if the defendant would explain why he had carried out the murder, he said he could not help the court, adding that Selamaj simply accepted he had done it and noted that his client had given him no instruction to express any remorse. Selamaj initially accepted responsibility for Nessa’s death, but pleaded not guilty to murder at a pre-trial hearing on 16 December. But he changed that plea to guilty on 25 February, as his trial was due to begin at the Old Bailey.",News/UK news,Sabina Nessa murder: Koci Selamaj jailed for minimum of 36 years,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/08/koci-selamaj-jailed-sabina-nessa-murder
4/8/2022,"Maria de Lourdes loves her leader and is desperate for him to stay. “He’s the best president we’ve had in 70 years,” the retiree enthused this week as she prepared to bombard her phone contacts with calls urging them to back him on Sunday, when Mexico goes to the polls. Latin America’s second biggest economy is not holding a presidential election, however – the next one is not due until 2024. Rather, voters will be offered a straightforward question in Mexico’s first ever national recall election: should president Andrés Manuel López Obrador have his mandate revoked, or not? Lourdes, a fervent “Obradista” who regularly posts pro-López Obrador memes on social networks, has no doubt which way she will vote in the ballot which, unusually, was championed by the president himself. López Obrador, a 68-year-old populist who took power in 2018, has claimed the referendum is a way to hold the executive accountable to the people and prevent government corruption. De Lourdes agrees. “Now with the recall in place, future presidents will have to think hard before they betray the people,” she said. Mexico was for many years a de facto one party state, in which the conservative Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) ruled uninterrupted for more than 70 years until 2000, and then another six between 2012 and 2018. Combating corruption and ensuring transparency were among the key campaign promises of López Obrador, who is better known as Amlo. But during his three years in office, international anti-corruption organization Transparency.org has documented only a 3% positive change in corruption levels. Amlo’s approval rating fell for a few weeks in February, after the revelation that his son had rented a multi-million dollar mansion in Houston owned by a senior figure at an oil firm that has done business with the Mexican government. In recent polling, more than half of the Mexican electorate said they believed the vote to be unnecessary. But hardcore Amlovers – as fanatical supporters of the Mexican president are known – beg to differ. “If we had been able to do this [recall a president] before, we would have been able to avoid so many tragedies, so many deaths, so many economic failures. Now we’ll have the power to dictate the future of Mexico, us Mexicans – not just the more privileged leadership of before that felt untouchable,” said Karla Reséndez, an Amlover from Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, who works as a rancher. Amlo’s term has seen its own share of deaths, however: the president has repeatedly been accused of a cavalier response to a pandemic which has taken the lives of about 323,000 Mexicans. Meanwhile, violence remains at a historic high, and this year, Mexico reached the total of 100,000 people disappeared in the drug war. But if recent polls are to be trusted, any calls to remove the president this weekend are futile. Amlo’s approval ratings remain high, and a projected 70% of voters will choose to keep him in office. For the vote to be certified, if he is indeed recalled, turnout must reach 40%. Several other referendums put before the public over the past two years, including one on possible immunity for former presidents, only achieved a 7% turnout. Though the results of the recall election are unlikely to be surprising, the cost of this procedural vote has reached 1.6bn pesos, roughly $80m – in reality only half of what the government initially asked for. Reséndez thinks the vote is worth the money, as it could save the country money in the long run. “Before, the government bailed out private banks and put us into a lot of debt. Now we will have a chance to evaluate the performance of the government and prevent it from happening again.” Support for the president is so ironclad, some opposition groups have even urged supporters to vote “continue” or not vote at all, and wait to unseat Amlo in 2024. “You finish [the term], then you leave!” a sign at an anti-Amlo rally read last week.",News/World news,Stay or go?

4/8/2022,"Nick Hart is an austere, unfussy traditional singer, but far from a dull one; humanity and sly humour crackle warmly through his work. This was there in the bunch of supermarket roses he clutched on the cover of his 2017 debut (Nick Hart Sings Eight English Folk Songs) and the eggs he cradled on its follow-up (Nick Hart Sings Nine English Folk Songs). Both albums bristled with intense, stripped-down folk songs, with Hart’s everyday East Anglian delivery giving them extra dimensions of feeling.Album three was recorded with similar simplicity – most of it in his back bedroom during lockdowns – but this time around, he drafts in more unusual instruments: bones, spoons, a viola da gamba, even a lyre he made from an old banjo and some table legs, played using a similar technique to that of the krar in Ethiopia and Eritrea, where the strings are unmuted to release sound. Many songs here reveal his sparse, filmic style. It’s easy to imagine landscapes pouring out of the plucked guitar figures of May Song, a Cambridgeshire carol where a man keeps turning to the Lord “again”, a sense of need underlined by a male chorus joining him. Jack Hall is a compelling gallows confessional, while Hart’s version of love song Lemany carries sweetness, as well the mystery of the protagonist’s past. Hart’s stark musicianship is also sharply affecting. The clarinet he plays at the beginning of Lucy Wan adds a lamenting shiver to the murder ballad, while the guitar-guided Under the Leaves of Life, a tale of going to town and finding “sweet Jesus Christ / with his body nailed to a tree”, feels devastatingly direct. Hart guts and skins these songs, amplifying the eeriness in their ordinariness. Lamkin: Versions & Variants Across the Northern Hemisphere (Death Is Not the End) is a fascinating cassette and Bandcamp-only release, unearthing previous unreleased field recordings of the bloody murder ballad from archives across the US, Ireland and the UK. Many different, raw and rousing versions twitch the bones, from singers aged between 29 to 93. Another anthology just out on the label, of guttural, mid-century Greek rebetika recordings, A Cloudy Dawn, is also fantastic. Canadian Folk Music award winner Abigail Lapell’s beautiful fourth album, Stolen Time (Outlaw Music) is a moving collection of songs inspired by nature, the seasons and her family’s experience as refugees fleeing eastern Europe during the Holocaust.",Arts/Music,Nick Hart: Nick Hart Sings Ten English Folk Songs review | Jude Rogers's folk album of the month,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/08/nick-hart-nick-hart-sings-ten-english-folk-songs-review
