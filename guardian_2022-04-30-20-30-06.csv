4/30/2022,"Barry and Eddie Hearn are the heavyweight promoters and hype-men responsible for some of the biggest moments in sporting history. Dagenham-born Barry rocketed the status of sports such as snooker, poker, darts and boxing, and is the founder of TV promotion company Matchroom Sport. Eddie, now chairman, found his feet representing golfers, before becoming the first boxing promoter to strike a $1bn streaming deal. Barry’s autobiography, My Life: Knockouts, Snookers, Bullseyes, Tight Lines and Sweet Deals, is released on 28 April. This is Dad and me sat in the study, when I’m about 10. His work phone would go off all night, and I’d never intentionally listen but I was subconsciously taking it in. I’d hear a lot of arguments and raised voices, questions about fighters, Eubank, Bruno, Naseem. It was exciting. Now I’m a carbon copy of Dad. Only with a mobile, so there’s no escape. Dad wasn’t around that much when I was young; he was travelling a lot. I’d always wait for him to come through the front gates, and once we’d finish dinner he’d take me outside to play football or cricket for an hour. He was ridiculously competitive and would bowl full pelt. It wouldn’t matter what we were doing, he would never let me win. And now I don’t let my two daughters win. The mindset in our family is: you win when you deserve to win. You never get given victory. Dad was worried that I would be a spoilt rich kid, the type he hated, growing up. I was a bad teenager. At the weekend I’d fly around the world with him, then be back to school on Monday. I’d have teachers going on at me and I’d be thinking, “I’ve just been in New York with Frank Bruno and you’re telling me off?” That was the wrong attitude. I felt this struggle for my own identity: I was so proud of being known as Barry Hearn’s son – but I eventually realised that’s all I’d be, unless I worked hard and did something spectacular. Dad always said to me that when I turned 18 we’d go to the boxing gym and have a fight. By the time I was 16 I was nearly 6ft, and he said: “I think we should do it now.” So we went to a gym in Romford and sparred. It was pretty violent. I hit him to the body, and he couldn’t carry on in the second round. It was embarrassing, but he couldn’t have been happier. “My son!” he said. “He ain’t no soft kid. He’s one of us.” When Dad had his first heart attack, he was 50. My grandad died at 45, and his dad at 44, so it was worrying. When we get to the hospital, he’s all wired up, and the doctor asks: “Do you smoke?” Dad had given up but was always a bit of a crafty smoker, only my mum didn’t know that. He says: “Well, every now and then.” And she goes: “You do what?” The monitor starts flashing as his heart rate shoots up. Then the doctor asks: “Are you on any diet tablets?” Mum goes: “Look at him! Does he look like he is?” And Dad says: “Well, I was taking these slimming tablets … ” She went berserk! It was hilarious. He had another heart attack in 2020, but he’s already back running marathons. I’m 42 now and get my heart checked regularly. These days we’re still competitive but it’s all about business – how many tickets you’ve sold, how much money you’ve made. He’s also chasing me for time rather than the other way around. Yesterday he says to me: “How many games of cricket are we going to play this year? Will we play golf next week?” and I go: “Well, Dad, I’ll have to see.” I was not a good dad. You have to be selfish if you want to be successful, and when Eddie was little I was still making my mark. As time went on, around the time this photo was taken, I got better, spent more time with him. It’s a posed call for the purpose of the picture, but it’s the phone I’d be using to speak to Don King or Bob Arum. When my wife Susan’s waters broke with Eddie – one of the worst things I’ve ever seen – I took her straight to Epping Forest hospital at 9.30am. Her previous labour with our daughter Katie had taken 24 hours, so as far as I was concerned I could drop her off and still play snooker with this geezer for £50 at 12pm. At 1pm the hospital phones. A nurse says: “Your wife’s in the final stages of labour.” I reply: “It’s one-all.” The girl says: “Sorry, what does that mean?” I go: “I’m playing snooker against this fella and if it goes well, I’ll have the deciding frame and I’ll be there as quickly as I can.” Anyway, I win. I pot a lovely pink down the rail and then drive like a maniac back to the hospital. When I arrive I see Susan on the trolley and tell her: “Best of luck, girl.” She replies: “Where’ve you been, you bastard? I had it 20 minutes ago!” I’ve never lived it down. Doesn’t mean I didn’t care, though. I brought Eddie up to kill or be killed. I came from less than nothing – I don’t say that to be proud, it’s just factual. The area we lived in had been bombed in the war, so we moved to a new industrial estate. My dad was a bus driver, and we had no money. When I was 10 I had to wear short trousers because we couldn’t afford long ones. A lot of kids laughed at me for it. It made me quite violent, and I’ve never liked bullies from that day on. I was really quite concerned about Eddie early doors. I was thinking, “This kid has everything he wants and I’m not sure I like what I see.” He was flashy, mouthy – a public schoolboy. So I wanted to fight him. Susan went mad: “If you hurt my son in that ring … ” I wasn’t going to kill him, but I was gonna knock him out. And I hit him with a proper punch. He didn’t even fall over, and I thought, “Wait a second … ” When I left that ring I was made up. From that moment, I knew he would follow in my footsteps. The one piece of advice my dad told me was, “Don’t waste a second of your life.” And I haven’t. I pushed Eddie into everything and I wanted him to be the same as me. Now it doesn’t matter when I die, because Eddie is me – he sounds and thinks like me. It’s almost like having a twin. And without sounding terribly big-headed, I know I’m his hero, which is a nice feeling. Eddie is making the company far bigger than I ever thought it was going to be, which is why I stood down. He’s a bloody good operator, and we’ve been on this journey together. I like to think I started off as a dad and ended up as his best friend. Even if he does take the piss out of me relentlessly.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Barry and Eddie Hearn look back: ‘When I turned 16 he took took me to a boxing ring and we sparred.

4/30/2022,"John Coates, the outgoing president of the Australian Olympic Committee, drafted his own letter of recommendation stating that it was “hard to think of anybody better qualified in the world of sport” to be appointed to the organising committee of the 2032 Brisbane Olympics. Coates is Australia’s most celebrated official in the Olympic movement and a vice-president of the International Olympic Committee. He stood down on Saturday as president of the AOC after 32 years. He will become the AOC’s inaugural honorary life president after the 2024 Paris Olympics, when he stands down from the IOC. The life presidency role was written into the AOC’s constitution at last year’s AGM and Coates was formally awarded the position in March 2022. An email sent by Coates on 1 April 2021, to Matt Carroll, the chief executive officer and vice president of the AOC, shows he drafted a gushing letter of recommendation that he be allowed to join the Brisbane Games’ organising committee when Coates becomes life president of the AOC. Coates asked that the letter be signed by Carroll and sent on to Peter Sheehan and Mark Cushing of BDO Consultancy, an accountancy firm involved in establishing Brisbane’s organising committee after it was awarded the Games. It is understood that the draft was reviewed and considered by Carroll before being sent. According to Coates the honorary position of life president does not carry any voting rights on the AOC Executive “but it will carry influence, if they want it, within the organising committee”. Coates has been heavily involved in Australian-hosted Olympics as president of the AOC, vice president of the organising committee of the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and deputy chairman of the candidate leadership group for the Brisbane 2032 Games. The letter drafted by Coates for Carroll begins: “As you know, the Olympic charter and the Olympic hosting contract provide that the AOC should be represented at the Brisbane Ocog [Organising Committee of the Olympic Games] by our president, currently John Coates, and me as CEO (secretary general). “After 31 years, John will not contest the presidency when his current term concludes at the AOC AGM in May 2022. So he will hold the NOC president’s position on the Ocog until then and be replaced by whoever is elected as AOC president.” The letter goes on to note that “it is likely” that the AOC executive will appoint Coates as its honorary life president at some time in the future and urges them to include a position for the veteran sports administrator on the organising committee. “I am attaching John’s long-form CV and particularly refer you to his Rowing, IOC, Australian Olympic teams, Olympic bids, Socog, Icas/Cas and other sporting events,” it continues. From these I hope you and the OCLG [Olympic Candidature Leadership Group] will agree that John is uniquely qualified to continue to add value to the Brisbane Ocog following the conclusion of his membership as an independent IOC member at end 2024. “Indeed, it is hard to think of anyone better qualified in the world of sport. Accordingly, you and the OCLG are requested to include a position for AOC honorary life president on the Ocog commencing on the conclusion of his membership as an independent IOC member.” On 25 March 2022, almost 12 months after the letter was sent by Carroll, Coates was appointed to the honorary life president role by the AOC executive committee. In a statement, the AOC said: “The AOC members overwhelmingly decided in 2020 to change the AOC constitution to create the honorary life president role and the AOC executive unanimously agreed to appoint John Coates to the role on 25 March 2022. The role will not come into effect until after the Paris 2024 Olympic Games. “For clarity, the AOC executive may choose to appoint either the president or the honorary life president to one position on the Ocog, while the chief executive officer will be the other AOC representative. That will be a decision for the AOC executive after Paris 2024,” they said. “For further clarity, the contents of the letter addressed to BDO Consultancy do not propose that Mr Coates be made honorary life president of the AOC. The letter proposes, as indicated above, that the role of honorary life president of the AOC could be included on the Ocog board after the Paris Olympic Games in 2024 and that John Coates would likely be appointed to that role.” A lawyer acting for Coates said: “Mr Coates has not breached the AOC’s rules or processes, and we refer you to the AOC CEO to verify this.” Ian Chesterman, who served as Australia’s chef de mission to six winter Olympics and is AOC vice president, will succeed Coates after defeating former Olympic swimmer Mark Stockwell by 67 votes to 26 in a vote at the AOC’s annual general meeting on Saturday. IOC president Thomas Bach, who travelled to Sydney to attend the AGM, congratulated Chesterman and hailed Coates, saying he was “leaving the AOC in a great state”.",Sport/Sport,‘Uniquely qualified’: John Coates drafted letter of praise for himself to Brisbane Olympics organisers,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/30/uniquely-qualified-john-coates-drafted-letter-of-praise-for-himself-to-brisbane-olympics-organisers
4/30/2022,"If Old Firm derbies define a Scottish season, it is fitting Sunday’s version sums up the curious nature of the campaign to date. A Celtic success, the most likely outcome, would all but confirm the reclaiming of the Premiership title. Ange Postecoglou’s team would be nine points and at least 20 goals ahead of Rangers with three matches to play. Yet an alternative scenario cannot be completely discounted, demonstrated by Rangers’ deserved success over their oldest foes in the Scottish Cup semi-final on 17 April. Rangers’ season has been one of epic highs – that Hampden triumph and victory over Borussia Dortmund en route to the Europa League semi-final – but horrible lows. It has been forgotten that the 10 men of Malmö bundled Rangers out of the Champions League at the qualifying phase. On Boxing Day, Rangers held a seemingly unassailable six-point lead at the summit; subsequent stumbles against Aberdeen, Ross County and Dundee United plus a trouncing at Celtic Park collided with Postecoglou’s side finding their sweet spot. It is unfair to declare Giovanni van Bronckhorst’s appointment as the successor to Steven Gerrard as a mistake. Rangers’ European run, very much alive despite a 1-0 defeat to RB Leipzig on Thursday, is worthy of huge respect. Should Rangers take the ultimate Europa League prize – another possibility it would be unwise to laugh off – domestic failings will barely matter. For now, given Celtic lie in immediate opposition, it is merely fair to highlight the contrasting fortunes of sides who were separated by 25 points, in Rangers’ favour, when last season concluded. It may be denied now, but a noisy percentage of the Rangers support declared contentment when Gerrard hot-footed it to Villa Park in November. There was a sense Rangers had gone stale under the former Liverpool captain and that he had grown disillusioned with transfer business. Van Bronckhorst, afforded immediate love-bombing as a former Rangers player, was widely portrayed as the right man at the right time. That he was freely available and had an existing connection with Rangers’ omnipresent sporting director, Ross Wilson, helped. Van Bronckhorst, of course, has wandered into exactly the same situation as Gerrard at least looked irritated by. Rangers’ January transfer window included the vanity loan of Aaron Ramsey and the even more bizarre capture of Amad Diallo on loan from Manchester United. “I’m absolutely delighted that we have been able to convince both Manchester United and Amad that Rangers is the perfect place for him to continue to showcase his undoubted and exciting talent,” said Wilson. The longest Diallo has managed in a Rangers shirt is 70 minutes, in a cup tie against Annan Athletic. When Rangers needed to kick on – which also applied last summer – they added Mateusz Zukowski and James Sands, who have had minimal or zero impact. Van Bronckhorst has displayed a strange aversion to Steven Davis, who remains more than capable of influencing games in Scotland despite his veteran status. None of this is to state categorically that Rangers are in a state of crisis. It is merely that the extent of their league lapse has been disguised by their Europa League exploits. In Leipzig, there was a diligence and shape to Rangers. At Hampden, Van Bronckhorst’s players rattled Celtic in a fashion not witnessed since the fraught early days of the Postecoglou era. Therein lies the epitome of a weird seasonal narrative. Should Postecoglou preside over an immediate rebound from semi-final pain, he should be regarded as Scotland’s manager of the season. The League Cup, won by a piece of genius from one of the players Postecoglou coaxed from Japan, Kyogo Furuhashi, is already housed at Celtic Park. Adding the title may draw shrugs from those who not unreasonably regard the Scottish top flight in the context of bald men and combs but the scale of rebuild required after a calamitous last campaign means Postecoglou is worthy of immense credit. Celtic’s board believe in their manager to the point where he will inevitably be backed heavily in the summer. Unknowns surrounding what Rangers can or will do in the same window demonstrate sharply shifting sands.",Sport/Football,Old Firm derby highlights contrasting trajectories of Celtic and Rangers,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/30/old-firm-derby-highlights-contrasting-trajectories-of-celtic-and-rangers
4/30/2022,"Growing up, every Saturday morning while my school friends were out shopping, going to drama school or learning to dive at the local swimming pool, I would put on my shalwar kameez and head to my mosque’s weekend school. There, I would sit cross-legged on prayer mats with other young girls, our heads covered with soft chiffon scarves, listening intently to stories from Islamic history, before catching up on school gossip and that week’s Top of the Pops. I was seven when I started going to the school in Bradford, and 15 when I left. It was the 1980s, and there were about 20 of us. Our parents all knew each other, most of the congregation was of Pakistani heritage, and most of the children second generation. We learned the basics of the Islamic faith, how to offer prayer in Arabic with English translation, how to read the Qur’an, and what being a Muslim required of us. We had sports days and speech competitions, went swimming and learned to cook. We navigated two cultures, and languages, weaving together English and Urdu. It made a change from my Catholic girls’ school, where the syllabus was gospel, sacraments, and Christ through the eyes of Christianity. The supplementary school helped me find answers to some of the questions my friends asked about being Muslim. Growing up with two faiths gave me clarity. While Islam respects all prophets, little is taught about Jesus in the mosque. My secondary school gave me insight into the foundations of British holidays and traditions, in a way that connected with Islam.

Above right: Sam, nine, joined Orot when he was in reception. ‘I have nice friends there. The work is challenging but fun. Today, I am handling a Burmese python. They are constrictors, so it could squeeze me, and eat me whole’ During the year, we’d have regional competitions where girls and young women would come together to give speeches on topics such as “cleanliness is next to godliness” and “Islam and the rights of women”, recite the Qur’an in Arabic, sing religious songs and take part in quizzes. We’d pack into a coach and travel down the M1 to London for a two-day event where we’d compete against girls from similar backgrounds from other parts of the country. We all spoke Urdu, but it was our English accents that revealed where we were really from – Bradford, Glasgow, Gillingham or Manchester. The women making the announcements were always Pakistani aunties, and even now place names such as Walthamstow and Redbridge are converted to a particular pronunciation in my head. Supplementary schools are common to a variety of cultures. Photographer Craig Easton has spent several months travelling across the UK, documenting students at Saturday and Sunday schools, ranging from a Japanese school in Livingston to a school in Buckinghamshire for children of African heritage. “There are hundreds of these schools, full of British kids who want to celebrate their family heritage and culture,” he says. “Some of the schools are faith schools, and others are about ‘this is the country you came from, and this is the political background to the place’.” Easton, an award-winning photographer, has a thread running through his work: the idea that it is possible to be British and still hold on to one’s heritage. He is keen for his images to be an antidote to the rise of rightwing nationalism. “Photography and journalism are so good at shining light into dark corners, but I wanted to turn that around and say how brilliant some things are across the country. These are kids with thick Mancunian or Scottish accents celebrating their Japanese culture or their Polish culture. They are all deeply connected to the culture or faith, while also being deeply British.” Easton said he was received well by all the schools. “The children had enormous pride in their cultural identity, and it was celebratory. That’s what I loved about it.” One of the groups he visited was a Polish school in Aylesbury. After Poland joined the EU in 2004, the community in the UK began to grow. Four years later, the Aylesbury Saturday school was set up by the local Polish community as a means of holding on to their traditions and language. “There was a real sense of longing,” Michalina Skierkowska, head of the school, tells me. “People missed their family, the culture, the food and the reality of being in Poland.” Since then, hundreds of children, from reception age to GCSE, have passed through the school, which is funded by the Polish government and membership fees, supplemented by fundraising activities. Polish Saturday School, Aylesbury. Top: Marcel, six. Above: Rosie, seven, who was born in London “Education through the Polish school isn’t just about broadening your horizons and learning the language and culture and everything else – it gives you that sense of security that, any time you want to go back, the door is always open,” Skierkowska says. The children learn about Polish culture, food and history, as well as about the Catholic faith. They have the opportunity to learn to read and speak Polish. Many of the children take a GCSE in the language, but the skills they gain also help them stay connected with family back home. “Having to grow up facing harsh realities, postwar, I remember my sisters had to queue in the shops because there was no food available, and we had to learn to grow produce and cook from scratch,” Skierkowska says. “It gave us a strong work ethic. We want to make sure our children have the same resilience, and they are patriotic about the country.” Scotland Japanese School, Livingston.

Break time is the best. I try to have fun with my friends’ Teachers at other supplementary schools are similarly passionate about their mission. Yuko Hirono is on the committee of the Scotland Japanese school. Children have been coming to the Saturday school in Livingston from Glasgow, Edinburgh and other parts of the country for 40 years. There are currently 95 students, aged five to 15, who spend three hours every Saturday morning studying Japanese literature. Hirono found out about the school when she moved to Scotland 10 years ago with her five-year-old daughter. “The programme was for the Japanese expat community, initially, but at the moment there are more children from mixed marriages.” They learn how to write and read in Japanese, although, Hirono says: “The level of learning isn’t quite the same as it is in Japan. They learn to write Chinese characters and Japanese characters, and read and discuss Japanese novels. We also have calligraphy classes, sports days and a graduation ceremony done in the way it is in Japan.” Akacia complementary school, High Wycombe. Top: Hannah, 12. ‘I come here for 3.5 hours on Saturday mornings during term times. I love the maths classes.

It is funded by Scottish Development International, a subsidy from the foreign ministry of Japan, and grant money from Japanese companies in Scotland; it has recently applied for charity status. “Funding has been a crucial issue,” Hirono says. “Running the school is quite a hard job for parents. But they all greatly appreciate the Japanese school. It’s like a ‘little Japan’, a small community where you speak your own language, even swap homemade Japanese foods. There is a great spirit of mutual aid.” Hadaf Persian School, London. Above left: Alma, 16, taking part in a traditional dance from Iran. ‘We’ve performed it every year since I joined the school.

I feel very at home.’ Above right: Kiara, seven, who also has an older sister at the school On the other side of the UK, in High Wycombe, is Further south, in High Wycombe, is the Akacia complementary school. The idea of an African school was revived 25 years ago by Kojo Asare Bonsu. “As an African parent, I was concerned. Every year I read that our so-called Black Caribbean children, especially our boys, weren’t functioning and benefiting from the British education system. So five of us decided that we would restart the Saturday school. The original school was started here in the UK among Africans who came out of the British colonies in the 1960s. Grandparents, parents, mothers and fathers were concerned about the narrative and the biases that were connected to the whole issue of us, as African people, being able to comprehend and embrace high culture.” ‘Nicolae Iorga’ Romanian School, Wirral. Above left: Luca, eight, was born in Bucharest and has attended the school since it opened in 2018.

They are taught maths and English, the history of Africa and its people, alongside “self-respect, self-esteem and self-worth”, says Bonsu. “We have inspirational speakers. In March, we had a visit from Paul Obinna, the creator of the African timeline, a poster that presents 8,000 years of history. In May we’re going to have African board games, and in June we’re going to have African storytelling and then, just before the close of term, African drumming.” Saint Stanislaw Kostka Polish School, Aberdeen. Aurelia, 10, was born in Aberdeen and has been at the school for a year: ‘I’m learning a lot about our literature and traditions. We learn through fun – I like to dress up and take part in competitions’ Bonsu is passionate about the work his school is doing, and my own experiences tell me he is right to be. It’s been more than 30 years since I left my Saturday school, and while I didn’t always appreciate being torn away from the telly on a weekend, the experience did give me a strong sense of identity. Being around young women who matched all my cultural, social and religious intersections meant I didn’t feel like an anomaly. At times when Islamophobia or racism have raised their head, I’ve been equipped to deal with it, and able to differentiate between religion and culture. The girls from the mosque school have remained a constant in my life. It was a place of shared experiences, strong friendships and figuring out what we wanted, as much as what we didn’t.",News/Education,‘I feel very at home’: the UK schools keeping children in touch with their global roots,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/30/uk-weekend-supplementary-schools-keeping-kids-in-touch-with-family-history
4/30/2022,"Jupiter and Venus, two of the solar system’s brightest planets, will appear to almost touch in a rare celestial spectacle this weekend. Although in reality they will be millions of miles apart, for stargazers on Earth they will appear to be close enough to almost collide in a planetary conjunction that occurs once a year. However, this year Jupiter and Venus will look much closer together than usual and should be visible with just a pair of binoculars or even the naked eye. If you miss it, you will have to wait another 17 years for a repeat performance. As well as the extraordinary planetary conjunction on display, Saturn and Mars will also appear to be in a straight line with Jupiter and Venus. Brad Tucker, an astrophysicist at the Australian National University, said the planets had been moving closer together over the past couple of weeks. “Although Venus and Jupiter get close to one another every few years, this time there is also Mars and Saturn in the mix which is pretty rare,” he said. “If you have a telescope, a pair of binoculars or a decent camera, then you’ll get an even better view.” Despite their close appearance, the planets will actually be 430m miles apart in orbit. The peak time to see the event in the UK was at about 5am on Saturday from a high vantage point with a clear eastern horizon. However, it will still be visible on Sunday and the days that follow as the planets move apart again. From London, it will be almost impossible to witness but the farther west in the country you are, the closer the planets will appear to be. Observers in Sydney, Australia, will have a clear view with the pair of planets due to rise in the east at about 3.30am on 1 May. “The planets will differ in their brightness”, space scientist and chief stargazer at the Society for Popular Astronomy Prof Lucie Green told BBC News. “Venus is brighter than Jupiter so it will look dazzlingly bright when you see it. Jupiter will be slightly fainter, about one-sixth of the brightness of Venus.” Venus, Jupiter, Mercury and Mars came together in the eastern sky in a formation not likely to be seen again until 2040, during the early sunrise hours of 13 May 2011.",News/Science,Jupiter and Venus will seem to nearly collide in rare celestial spectacle,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/30/jupiter-and-venus-will-seem-to-nearly-collide-in-rare-celestial-spectacle
4/30/2022,"Senior Conservative MP Caroline Nokes has accused the party of “unnecessary dither and delay” in taking action against Neil Parish, in light of allegations that he watched pornography in the House of Commons. Nokes, who chairs the women and equalities committee, also said it would be “difficult” for Parish to spend the required time in parliament as a select committee chair while under investigation. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme,she said: “I felt by leaving it until Friday before we knew that action had been taken by the whips that it felt like unnecessary dither and delay.” She continued that although she was not calling for Paris to stand down immediately from his role, it was “right those investigations are carried out before any further action is taken”. Whether Parish should continue as the chair of the environment select committee, Nokes added that was a “matter for Neil to discuss with the party whips and to take a position on, but I think whilst he’s under investigation it’s going to make it very difficult for him to be in the Commons as much as he needs to be”. Parish, the MP for Tiverton and Honiton in Devon, had the whip suspended after becoming the fourth MP from his party since the last election to face claims of impropriety. He revealed he had referred himself to the standards commissioner, Kathryn Stone, on Friday afternoon after senior Tory women expressed outrage at the party for failing to act on complaints made earlier this week despite being aware of his identity. Parish has suggested that he may have opened the pornography accidentally, but has rejected calls to stand down as an MP immediately. The safeguarding minister Rachel Maclean has held her position that Parish should be removed from the party if he is found guilty of the allegations. Speaking to Sky News on Saturday, Maclean said: “Clearly if this is substantiated and those allegations turn out to be true, of course I stand by what I said, but at the same time there is now an investigation so it wouldn’t be helpful for me to speculate on the specific outcomes. “This type of behaviour has no place in any workplace let alone parliament, but I think everybody would accept that when there’s an allegation that’s made … it isn’t really for us, as colleagues, to sit on judgment in another colleague, it is for that process to take place.” Maclean added that she has “absolutely every confidence in the chief whip”. “He’s acting incredibly quickly, I don’t see why the investigation can’t be concluded very quickly and I’m certain that appropriate action will then follow from that,” she said. Parish, a 65-year-old farmer, said he would resign if found guilty by Stone, who is yet to say whether she will open an investigation. Separately, the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (ICGS), which looks into claims of bullying and sexual harassment, is understood to have begun examining events after at least one witness made a referral. Parish said in a statement on his website he “will be cooperating fully with any investigation, and whilst it is ongoing I will continue to perform my duties”.",News/Politics,Senior Tory accuses party of ‘dither and delay’ over MP porn allegations ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/30/caroline-nokes-senior-tory-accuses-party-of-dither-and-delay-over-neil-parish-mp-porn-allegations
