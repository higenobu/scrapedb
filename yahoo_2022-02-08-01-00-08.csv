2/8/2022,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Sixteen people died in Mexico's central state of Zacatecas following an apparent violent dispute between criminal gangs, authorities said on Saturday, as the state grapples with a spike in violence. State prosecutor Francisco Murillo said 10 bodies were found wrapped in blankets in the streets of the Fresnillo municipality while another six were ""suspended"" inside a warehouse in the nearby community Panfilo Natera. Two people who were transporting another corpse a day earlier have been arrested, he added, saying the person could be linked to the other deaths. Last month, authorities found the bodies of 10 people abandoned inside a vehicle in the historic center of the state capital, also named Zacatecas, a few steps from the government offices. Homicides rose last year, official figures showed: the state of Zacatecas registered 1,050 in 2021, about 200 more than the previous year.

2/8/2022,"The Sports Illustrated Swimsuit edition is ringing in its 58th anniversary with a new advertising initiative aimed at gender equity. The “Pay With Change” mandate will only allow brands that are helping to drive gender equality forward to advertise in the magazine’s annual print issue as well as across its digital platforms. MJ Day, editor-in-chief of the SI Swimsuit edition, told Yahoo Finance Live that the advertising mandate, which goes into effect with the magazine’s May 2022 edition, will set a new standard for publishers. “We do believe that this will be a revolutionary kind of industry change and shift,” she said. Brands that can illustrate they are creating change for women will be certified as a Changemaker, which Day defined as a brand that has made, is making, and will make progress for women. “What we want to see is proof of that progress,” she said. “Any progress is good progress when you're speaking around women empowerment.” Day, who has been editor-in-chief of the annual issue since 2014, acknowledged that the SI Swimsuit brand has long been criticized for objectifying women and said people who call its gender equity mandate hypocritical “haven't been paying attention.” “I would tell them that since the inception of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue, we've been doing more than almost any other brand out there in terms of elevating women's platforms and giving them opportunities to be more than just, you know, a, dot dot dot, swimsuit model.” In recent years, the magazine has featured an array of models from different ethnic backgrounds and with a range of body types. In a landmark moment last July model Leyna Bloom made history as the first transgender woman to grace the cover of Sports Illustrated’s annual swimsuit issue. “I felt it was a great responsibility, possessing the power that this brand does, to be as inclusive and as representative as we could be,"" she said. “The more good we can do with this power, and the more brands we can encourage to do the same, the better this industry and this landscape will be, not just for business but just for everyone.” While she declined to name which brands will appear in the magazine’s May edition, Day did say the response to the new advertising initiative has been “overwhelming.” SI Swimsuit will also invest a percentage of every ad dollar generated by the annual issue to create the Sports Illustrated Gender Equity Fund. The fund will support a yet-to-be-named nonprofit that is at the forefront of helping create an equitable future for all women. Alexis Christoforous is an anchor and reporter for Yahoo Finance.

2/8/2022,"ZHANGJIAKOU — Two words no journalist wants to hear in connection with their name are “dragged away,” and yet that’s exactly what happened to Dutch broadcaster Sjoerd den Daas. Chinese authorities hauled Den Daas, who was in the middle of a live broadcast at the Opening Ceremony for Dutch station NOS, away from the camera and shut down filming operations on live TV. Den Daas and his camera operator were not injured in the incident, which only lasted a few seconds but was a stark reminder of the potential problems of reporting even innocent broadcast coverage from China. Den Daas was able to set up and resume his broadcast shortly after the incident. The IOC downplayed the incident, placing the blame on an “overzealous” security official. “It was an unfortunate circumstance,” IOC spokesman Mark Adams said at a later daily news briefing. “These things do happen, and I think it’s a one-off. I hope it’s a one-off.” The IOC indicated it had reached out to NOS about the incident, but NOS officials told local Dutch media they had not heard from the IOC. The media in Beijing and surrounding venues are operating in a strict “closed-loop” system, with no freedom of movement beyond the edges of competition venues, official headquarters and hotels. Fences envelop every building within the “bubble,” and guards stand at every checkpoint and gate. Chinese authorities say the bubble is intended to contain the spread of COVID and protect the Chinese population from potential foreign infection, but the obvious effect is that Western media are prevented from connecting with anything outside the sharply regulated and sanitized bubble. Early Saturday morning Eastern time, Den Daas took to Twitter to give his version of events. “Shortly before 7 o’clock, we began filming around the Bird’s Nest,” Den Daas wrote. “The police kindly directed us outside the area that was being cordoned off around that time. We followed their orders. We then spent some time setting up to film a TV live at the place the police had just referred us to. “However, just after we had gone live, I was forcefully pulled out of the picture without any warning by a plainclothes man wearing a red badge that read, ‘Public Safety Volunteer.' He did not identify himself. “At the same time, another man took our light installation. When asked, they couldn’t say what we had done wrong. We were able to continue our TV live from a parking lot around the corner.” In an event as sprawling as the Olympics, with tens of thousands of police officers, volunteers and Olympic officials patrolling their own spaces, it’s not unusual for one enforcement hand not to know what the other is doing. Just hours before the Opening Ceremony, a police officer outside the Main Media Center was not aware of the location for media to board shuttle buses to the ceremony … even though the location turned out to be within sight, about 10 yards away. The air around the Bird’s Nest during the Opening Ceremony was already charged with both anticipation and nerves. Reporters were not permitted to bring items as routine as charging blocks into the Bird’s Nest. Volunteers pointed reporters arriving at the Opening Ceremony toward designated press, broadcast and photography locations, though gaps between the volunteers meant wandering off — whether for a broadcast live shot or for something as innocent as a selfie — was entirely possible. After the fireworks concluded, groups of spectators who’d been bused into the site actually crossed paths with departing media … which was exactly what the Chinese Olympic planners’ bubble had been designed to prevent. Procedural confusion isn’t uncommon at the Olympics, and borders between permitted and non-permitted spaces often aren’t clearly marked, so it’s not unusual that the reporter and camera operator could have been guided to a place they weren’t permitted to be. The intense and, yes, “overzealous” on-camera crackdown, however, is a harsh-but-clear lesson that the respect for a free press that exists in the Western world is nonexistent in China. “In recent weeks, we, like several foreign colleagues, have been hindered or stopped several times by the police while reporting on subjects related to the Games,” den Daas tweeted. “Therefore, it’s hard to see [Friday] night’s incident as an isolated incident, as the IOC claims, although such interference rarely happens live on broadcast. And now back to work.” The Olympics run through Feb. 20.",World/Yahoo Sports,Dutch TV reporter who was dragged away during live Olympic segment: 'We followed their orders',https://news.yahoo.com/dutch-tv-reporter-who-was-dragged-away-during-live-olympic-segment-212647442.html
2/8/2022,"There’s a whole lot happening right under our feet, at all times of the day and night. And most of the time we never think twice about it. But under the surface where our homes and businesses lie, there’s a whole other world. A system of pipes and tunnels that makes our existence in modern society possible. Not to mention naturally forming caves. But just how deep do all of these things go? Well, one YouTube channel has given us a pretty solid idea. The folks at MetalBallStudios have created an Underground 3D comparison video, and it’s fascinating to see exactly how far down just about everything goes. You can watch the full video right here: According to the video’s official description, “These are the deepest underground structures, represented on a real scale, mines, caves, cities, tunnels, installations, etc.” They added an extra note saying “Depth is measured from the lowest point to the surface, not to sea level.” You’ll be shocked to find just how far down some of these man-made installations go. There’s a Chinese nuclear command base that goes down over 6,000 feet. And then there’s a Chinese underground laboratory that goes down 7, 870 feet below ground. And those are all just scratching the surface. Pun fully intended. And then, there’s the Kola Superdeep Borehole. The Russian project attempted to drill as deep as possible into the Earth’s crust. And for decades, it was the world’s longest borehole in terms of measured depth. But that record was destroyed in 2008, by a different hole on the other side of the world. Even though this video makes it seem like it’s the deepest, there’s always a bigger fish.

2/8/2022,"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli and Palestinian public figures have drawn up a new proposal for a two-state confederation that they hope will offer a way forward after a decade-long stalemate in Mideast peace efforts. The plan includes several controversial proposals, and it's unclear if it has any support among leaders on either side. But it could help shape the debate over the conflict and will be presented to a senior U.S. official and the U.N. secretary-general this week. The plan calls for an independent state of Palestine in most of the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, territories Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel and Palestine would have separate governments but coordinate at a very high level on security, infrastructure and other issues that affect both populations. The plan would allow the nearly 500,000 Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank to remain there, with large settlements near the border annexed to Israel in a one-to-one land swap. Settlers living deep inside the West Bank would be given the option of relocating or becoming permanent residents in the state of Palestine. The same number of Palestinians — likely refugees from the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation — would be allowed to relocate to Israel as citizens of Palestine with permanent residency in Israel. The initiative is largely based on the Geneva Accord, a detailed, comprehensive peace plan drawn up in 2003 by prominent Israelis and Palestinians, including former officials. The nearly 100-page confederation plan includes new, detailed recommendations for how to address core issues. Yossi Beilin, a former senior Israeli official and peace negotiator who co-founded the Geneva Initiative, said that by taking the mass evacuation of settlers off the table, the plan could be more amenable to them. Israel's political system is dominated by the settlers and their supporters, who view the West Bank as the biblical and historical heartland of the Jewish people and an integral part of Israel. The Palestinians view the settlements as the main obstacle to peace, and most of the international community considers them illegal. The settlers living deep inside the West Bank — who would likely end up within the borders of a future Palestinian state — are among the most radical and tend to oppose any territorial partition. “We believe that if there is no threat of confrontations with the settlers it would be much easier for those who want to have a two-state solution,” Beilin said. The idea has been discussed before, but he said a confederation would make it more “feasible.” Numerous other sticking points remain, including security, freedom of movement and perhaps most critically after years of violence and failed negotiations, lack of trust. Israel’s Foreign Ministry and the Palestinian Authority declined to comment. The main Palestinian figure behind the initiative is Hiba Husseini, a former legal adviser to the Palestinian negotiating team going back to 1994 who hails from a prominent Jerusalem family. Other contributors include Israeli and Palestinian professors and two retired Israeli generals. Husseini acknowledged that the proposal regarding the settlers is “very controversial” but said the overall plan would fulfill the Palestinians' core aspiration for a state of their own. “It’s not going to be easy,” she added. ""To achieve statehood and to achieve the desired right of self-determination that we have been working on — since 1948, really — we have to make some compromises.” Thorny issues like the conflicting claims to Jerusalem, final borders and the fate of Palestinian refugees could be easier to address by two states in the context of a confederation, rather than the traditional approach of trying to work out all the details ahead of a final agreement. “We’re reversing the process and starting with recognition,” Husseini said. It's been nearly three decades since Israeli and Palestinian leaders gathered on the White House lawn to sign the Oslo accords, launching the peace process. Several rounds of talks over the years, punctuated by outbursts of violence, failed to yield a final agreement, and there have been no serious or substantive negotiations in more than a decade. Israel's current prime minister, Naftali Bennett, is a former settler leader opposed to Palestinian statehood. Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, who is set to take over as prime minister in 2023 under a rotation agreement, supports an eventual two-state solution. But neither is likely to be able to launch any major initiatives because they head a narrow coalition spanning the political spectrum from hard-line nationalist factions to a small Arab party. On the Palestinian side, President Mahmoud Abbas' authority is confined to parts of the occupied West Bank, with the Islamic militant group Hamas — which doesn't accept Israel's existence — ruling Gaza. Abbas' presidential term expired in 2009 and his popularity has plummeted in recent years, meaning he is unlikely to be able to make any historic compromises. The idea of the two-state solution was to give the Palestinians an independent state, while allowing Israel to exist as a democracy with a strong Jewish majority. Israel’s continued expansion of settlements, the absence of any peace process and repeated rounds of violence, however, have greatly complicated hopes of partitioning the land. The international community still views a two-state solution as the only realistic way to resolve the conflict. But the ground is shifting, particularly among young Palestinians, who increasingly view the conflict as a struggle for equal rights under what they — and three prominent human rights groups — say is an apartheid regime. Israel vehemently rejects those allegations, viewing them as an antisemitic attack on its right to exist. Lapid has suggested that reviving a political process with the Palestinians would help Israel resist any efforts to brand it an apartheid state in world bodies. Next week, Beilin and Husseini will present their plan to U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Beilin says they have already shared drafts with Israeli and Palestinian officials. Beilin said he sent it to people who he knew would not reject it out of hand. “Nobody rejected it. It doesn’t mean that they embrace it."" ""I didn’t send it to Hamas,” he added, joking. “I don’t know their address.”",World/Associated Press,"Israeli, Palestinian figures propose 2-state confederation",https://news.yahoo.com/israeli-palestinian-figures-propose-2-060904875.html
2/8/2022,"Feb. 7—Dec. 3, a Friday, was the day that everything changed for the Kurtz family. Linda Kurtz was sitting on the floor in the living room of her Reading home. Her adult son Jason was behind her on the sofa. And her husband, Ken, was a few feet away on an easy chair. All three were fighting severe cases of COVID. All three needed help. ""Jason said, 'Dad's already gone,' "" Linda said, recalling that fateful day while sitting in that same easy chair last week. ""Before we even called 9-1-1 he was dead."" The rest of that day is a blur for Linda. She knows that someone did, at some point, call 9-1-1. An ambulance arrived and whisked her and her son away. Linda would end up hospitalized at Reading Hospital and a rehab facility for 17 days. Jason was taken directly into intensive care at Reading Hospital. The 47-year-old would never leave. Nine days after COVID took his father's life, it would claim Jason's as well. The days and weeks since have been difficult for Linda, to say the least. Her world was shattered by COVID. Reliving it all — the fear and confusion, the loss and longing — is painful. But Linda says her family's story is one that desperately needs to be told. ""I would like people to know what can happen,"" she said. ""Don't think it can't happen to you, because we didn't think it could happen to us."" Dealing with the pandemic differently Before the COVID pandemic breached the borders of Berks County, changing just about every aspect of daily life in its wake, Linda and Ken were a pretty active couple. Both retired, they enjoyed going to auctions and flea markets, with Ken always keeping an eye out for a remote controlled plane kit he could build at his basement workbench. They enjoyed heading out to the movie theater, Linda said. And they liked to travel, often taking trips to their time-share in Virginia or to spots in New York state. COVID forced them to change their ways. ""We stopped going out,"" Linda said. ""When COVID hit, at that point everything stopped dead. We weren't people to go out and be in crowds."" Linda said she pretty much only ventured out to get groceries. Most times she was accompanied by Jason, who was out of work and living with his parents. When vaccinations became available, Linda and Ken got their first two shots. They didn't, however, get their boosters. Jason was a different story. ""We just could not persuade him to get a shot,"" Linda said. Jason refused to get vaccinated. According to his mother and older brother, Jim, his stance was based on a mix of stubbornness, overconfidence, conspiracy theories and religion. ""He was one of those people who thought if he got COVID he'd get over it,"" Linda said. Jim, who is Jason's only sibling, said his brother shared a similar sentiment with him. But other factors were at play, too. Jim said his little brother's politics played a role, as did his unfounded belief that the COVID vaccines are a ""great social experiment"" the government is performing on the public. Jason also cited religion when speaking to Jim about vaccines, saying that getting a shot is ""the mark of the beast."" In conversation after conversation, Jim tried to reason with Jason. He tried to provide facts to his younger brother. He tried to keep him safe. ""I had that talk way too many times,"" Jim Kurtz said. ""But it was one of those things where if it was coming from his big brother he didn't listen to it."" Jim, who lives in Maryland, said knowing his parents didn't have their booster shots and that his brother wasn't vaccinated at all worried him. He had been taking the pandemic more seriously than the rest of his family, he said. He's fully vaccinated and boosted, and he and his wife are able to work from home and seldom venture out. And when they do — to pick up a takeout meal or for a quick stop in a store — it's a different situation than the one in Pennsylvania. Maryland, he said, still has a statewide mask mandate. ""I was just sitting here cringing,"" he said. ""I was scared for them."" Jim's fear grew when he learned his parents and brother were planning to gather with family this past Thanksgiving. Linda said she didn't share her son's worries. ""I wasn't nervous, but I knew some of the people who would be there were not vaccinated,"" she said. ""But I wasn't even concerned that something could happen."" Something did happen. Of the 15 people that gathered that day, 10 ended up getting COVID. Three of them — Ken, Jason and Ken's brother, Russell Kurtz — would die of the disease. Sickness, panic and loss The day after Thanksgiving, Linda started feeling sick. She didn't think she had COVID, claiming that she didn't feel all that bad. Jim tells a different story, saying he thinks a ""COVID fog"" may be altering her memories. Jim said that when he talked to his family on Black Friday his mom was ""off."" For example, he said, she had poured a fruit cup onto a paper towel instead of into a bowel. When Jim talked to his family the next day, it was a phone conversation with Jason. His brother told him that their mom was in the hospital and that she, their dad and him all had COVID. Linda wasn't admitted to the hospital that time, instead being treated and discharged. When Jim called again the following Tuesday, he learned his mom had broken her shoulder. No one knew how it had happened. In that conversation, Jim said, his dad seemed to be doing well. He was chipper and jokey. But Jim was still concerned. ""I said, 'You guys keep an eye on each other,' "" he recalled, saying he told his family that if they start feeling worse to call for help. Jim called again Wednesday, this time finding his dad grumpy and not feeling well. His mom was asleep. He skipped Thursday, but called once more about 3 p.m. on Friday afternoon. That was Dec. 3. Jim didn't get an answer on the house phone. Calls to his mom's and brother's cellphones went to voicemail. An iMessage went unanswered. He tried again later that night with the same result. And Saturday morning the story was the same. ""I had no idea what was going on,"" he said. Jim's mother-in-law called Reading Hospital about 2 p.m. on that Saturday and found out that Linda had been admitted to the hospital. Jim called the hospital himself and found out that his brother was in intensive care. The hospital had no record for his father. Jim assumed his dad was likely sitting in the hospital waiting room by himself. Having undergone knee replacement on both knees earlier in the year, he wouldn't have been able to drive himself home. ""At that point in time I didn't know what had happened,"" he said. ""I was worried about my dad being in the waiting room alone."" Jim reached out to a few of his dad's brothers. One was eventually able to get in touch with Linda. ""When he called me back he was crying,"" Jim said. Just after 4 p.m., Jim learned his father had died of COVID the previous day at his home. Linda had only found out just before that her husband had passed away. The hospital chaplain had come to her room to tell her that Jason had been right. Ken had passed away on his easy chair shortly before an ambulance arrived to take her and her son to the hospital. Unfortunately, the family's story didn't end there. A few days later, on Dec. 12, Linda was allowed to visit Jason. He had been put on a respirator and was suffering from kidney failure. Jason wasn't conscious, but his mother said she had a feeling he could hear her as she talked to him. ""I told him, 'This is mom,' "" she said. ""I gave him permission to go. We have a strong Christian background, so I said, 'God will take care of you now because I can't.' "" Thirty minutes after her visit, Jason was gone. ""It's really surreal,"" Jim said of the rapid loss of his father and brother. ""This is what I was afraid of."" The day after Jason's death, Russell, Jason's uncle and Ken's brother, died of COVID at his home in Lancaster County. A caring husband and a precocious son Linda was a senior in high school when she met Ken in 1969. A friend of Linda's was seeing a friend of Ken's and the couple set them up on a blind date. Linda recalls they went to see a movie, but can't remember which film they saw. ""I liked him right away,"" she said. ""He was very nice."" The two dated for a few weeks, and then Ken took Linda to her prom. About a year later they were married, wed in a simple courthouse ceremony. She was 19 and he was 20. The couple moved into their home in the first block of Arlington Street, the one were Ken would one day die and were Linda still lives. Ken worked at a bakery until retiring in the 1990s. He loved to bake and cook, handling most of the meals at home and teaching his eldest son the tricks of the trade. Jim recalls fondly getting calls from his mom in the late afternoon — she worked day shift and Ken worked night shift — instructing him to wake up his dad and tell him to start dinner. It would be a slow process, with Ken giving his son instructions one at a time each time the boy climbed the stairs to rouse him. First he'd tell Jim to get the pan out. Then to unwrapped a steak and put it on the pan. He'd tell him to pick out a vegetable, and Jim would drag a chair to the refrigerator so he could stand on it to see into the freezer and make a selection. Eventually Ken would roll out of bed and make his way downstairs to finish preparing the meal as Jim sat closely by working on his homework. To this day, Jim has a love of cooking. Both Linda and Jim said Ken was a gregarious guy, usually found in a good mood and ready with a joke. ""He was a very easy person to get along with,"" Linda said. ""He was funny. And it was hard to get his temper up."" Jim didn't hesitate when asked to describe his dad's personality. ""He was Santa Claus without the beard,"" he said. ""He was happy go lucky."" As for Jason, descriptions of what he was like weren't as simple. ""Jason was Jason,"" his mom said. Linda said her younger son was often free-spirited and had a similar happy demeanor to his father. He had lots of friends and was always running around with them, she said. He was also not big on planning ahead. ""He was last-minute Charlie,"" Linda said. ""If he had a choral concert he'd tell me in the morning that it was that night and he needed me to take him."" Linda also said Jason was a very caring person. That's what led him to pursue a career in nursing. He was a licensed practical nurse, and worked for a time as a traveling nurse. After cutbacks and changes in the medical field left him without a job, he decided to change paths. Again looking for a career that would let him help people, Linda said, he went back to school to become a minister. Jim said he was never particularly close with his brother. When they were growing up, Jason was seldom found around the house. He described his younger brother as impatient and impulsive with a deep stubborn streak. ""He wants what he wants when he wants it,"" Jim said. And the future It has been tough for Linda and Jim to come to terms with the fate that has befallen their family. Linda's stint in the hospital meant she wasn't able to take part in burying her husband and son. That was done simply and quietly at a cemetery she hasn't yet been able to bring herself to visit. She's been trying to keep herself busy, to keep her mind off of her now silent, empty house. A big chunk of her time and energy has been spent on cleaning out that house, saying she's planning on moving into something smaller and more manageable. ""You can't think,"" she said. ""If you try to think you're going to make it worse. There's nothing I can do about it. Sitting here crying isn't going to help."" Jim said he's glad his mother has been so resilient. For him, he said, the ordeal hasn't seemed real. For most of it he was in Maryland, communicating by phone. He did drive to Pennsylvania a few days before his brother died, stopping at his parents' home to pick up clothing for his mother. ""All she had at the hospital was her nightgown and house coat,"" he said. Jim said he likely won't feel the full weight of the loss of his father and brother until he's able to gather once again with family. ""It's probably not going to hit me until I come back to Pennsylvania,"" he said. ""When we get together as a family for Thanksgiving or Christmas or something and they're not there."" One emotion that Jim said he is feeling is anger. He's mad at people who aren't taking the pandemic seriously, at people who refuse to get vaccinated. He fumes at people who think the devastation of COVID won't happen to them. ""It can be us,"" he said. ""Every time I hear someone say something like that I want to go and smack them.""","U.S./Reading Eagle, Pa.",David Mekeel: Reading father and son both lose their lives to COVID,https://news.yahoo.com/david-mekeel-reading-father-son-141300159.html
2/8/2022,"Stock traded mixed Monday at the start of another busy week for corporate earnings and fresh economic data as investors continue to assess the Federal Reserve's path forward for monetary policy. The S&P 500 was little changed after posting its best weekly gain of the year last week. The Dow also hugged the flat line, while the Nasdaq gained. After last week's rollercoaster trading — with stocks sliding following Meta Platforms' (FB) disappointing outlook, and then rebounding sharply following Amazon's (AMZN) earnings beat — investors are poised to receive another hefty batch of corporate earnings results. Companies including Disney (DIS) to Uber (UBER), Lyft (LYFT), Pfizer (PFE) and Coca-Cola (KO) are each set to report quarter results in the coming days. Peloton (PTON) will also post results amid reports that companies including Amazon and Nike (NKE) are considering making bids to purchase the fitness technology company. Heading into this week, just over half of S&P 500 companies had reported actual quarterly earnings results. The expected growth rate for aggregate S&P 500 earnings stood at 29.2%, according to data from FactSet on Friday. If maintained for the next several weeks of the earnings season, this would mark the fourth straight quarter that earnings grow by more than 25%. And on the economic data front, this week's Consumer Price Index (CPI) due out Thursday will serve as one key report helping market participants determine the next moves from the Federal Reserve to curb rising prices. Consensus economists are looking for the CPI to rise by 7.2% on an annual basis for January, marking the fastest rise in prices since 1982. Such a result would further add fuel to the narrative that the U.S. economy has recovered sufficiently, and is now running hot enough, to warrant an aggressive pivot to tightening from the Fed. Last week's much better-than-expected jump in payrolls in the Labor Department's January jobs report also underscored the extent of the recovery. ""Following the stunning performance of the January employment report, the coming week’s key release is likely to be Thursday’s January CPI report as it will provide policymakers and market participants insight about inflation amid furthering signs of persistent, elevated price pressures that, in turn, support expectations for hawkish monetary policy actions initiating in March,"" Sam Bullard, Wells Fargo senior economist, wrote in a note on Sunday. ""Further increases in inflation expectations, particularly longer-term expectations, would only add more pressure on the Fed to act in March and uncertainty over the path of rate hikes,"" he added. And indeed, market participants have increasingly priced in the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will ultimately raise interest rates five times in 2022, marking an increase from the just three interest rate hikes the central bank itself had telegraphed in December. Some investors have also suggested that the Fed might hike rates by 50 basis points after its March policy-setting meeting rather than by a quarter-point, which would mark the first move of such a magnitude since 2000. — Bitcoin prices (BTC-USD) rose for a fifth straight day on Monday, heading for its longest winning streak since early September as a rebound in equities and other risk assets extended to cryptocurrencies. Prices for the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization were up 5% to more than $43,400 Monday morning in New York. This brought Bitcoin to its highest level since January 15, according to Bloomberg data. Other smaller cryptocurrencies also rallied. Prices for the meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB-USD) jumped nearly 40% Monday morning, while Solana (SOL-USD) gained nearly 8%. — Peloton (PTON) shares rose by nearly 30% just after market open Monday morning amid reports that the fitness technology company had attracted interest among several major companies for a potential takeover. The Financial Times and Wall Street Journal reported Friday that both Nike and Amazon were considering making bids to purchase Peloton. Peloton shares have fallen 83% over the past 52 weeks as the company signaled demand was beginning to wane for its connected at-home stationary bike and treadmill products. The company has also recently received a sharp rebuke from activist investment firm Blackwells Capitals, which called for Peloton CEO John Foley to be removed amid the stock's slide. Despite the stock pop following reports of the deal, some Wall Street analysts expressed skepticism that such a deal would actually go through. ""We believe any deal is unlikely given (i) PTON's dual class share structure, with a handful of insiders holding the vast majority of super-voting shares; (ii) co-founder / CEO Foley's long-term vision for capturing burgeoning Connected Fitness TAM [total addressable market] is still in early innings, with expansion across verticals & geos in coming years, as well as likely higher penetration of broader home fitness market over time; and (iii) poor potential fit with reported suitors, including Amazon,"" Cowen analyst John Blackledge wrote in a note early Monday. — Here's where stocks were trading just after the opening bell: S&P 500 (^GSPC): +6.67 (+0.15%) to 4,504.12 Dow (^DJI): +57.38 (+0.16%) to 35,147.12 Nasdaq (^IXIC): +15.79 (+0.11%) to 14,113.80 Crude (CL=F): -$0.81 (-0.88%) to $91.50 a barrel Gold (GC=F): +$8.70 (+0.48%) to $1,816.50 per ounce 10-year Treasury (^TNX): -1.3 bps to yield 1.919% — Here's where markets were trading Monday morning: S&P 500 futures (ES=F): +3 points (+0.07%), to 4,495.50 Dow futures (YM=F): -4 points (-0.01%), to 34,974.00 Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): +23.25 points (+0.16%) to 14,708.75 Crude (CL=F): -$0.69 (-0.75%) to $91.62 a barrel Gold (GC=F): +$6.30 (+0.35%) to $1,814.10 per ounce 10-year Treasury (^TNX): -0.7 bps to yield 1.925% — Emily McCormick is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
