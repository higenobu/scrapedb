1/2/2022,"There are a few cultural conundrums out there in gardening which I wonder if I will ever get to the bottom of. As someone who has recently gotten into dabbling in a little home-breeding with rare begonia species, here is one that perpetually fascinates me, even if merely mentioning is likely to get me cancelled: why are so many new plant cultivars so hideous? If you have flicked through any major gardening catalogue recently, you will know what I mean, especially when it comes to bedding plants. Cultivars with ever-more fluorescent hues, often with jarring colour breaks, where highlighter-pink juts up against Day-Glo acid green. Breeders will often layer up these mutations, too, with ruffled petals, dramatically variegated leaves and flowers so huge the poor plants can barely hold them up. Short of spraying them in glitter and dunking them in gold paint, there is very little else you could do to a plant to make it more dazzling.  Now, I am fully aware of how much of a terrible horticultural snob this makes me, and also of the incredible level of breeding ingenuity and dedication that is needed to achieve this level of tackiness. However, my question – personal taste aside – is whether these cultivars are any good for horticulture. I absolutely recognise the importance of having a huge range of plant options to help support the widest diversity of gardening styles, but how many people do these Barbara-Cartland-meets-Drag-Race varieties really appeal to? Are they created this way because the aesthetic barometer that breeders work to – as with many cultural aspects in horticulture – is a few decades out of date? After all, plant breeding is a notoriously slow process. These varieties would make perfect sense in an era when crocheted loo-roll covers or chintzy potpourri were commonplace in interior design. But they are totally out of step with really every current trend in fashion, graphic design, architecture and interiors. Is it because these are simply the most common genetic quirks that come up when plant breeders are searching for novel traits? Variegation, colour breaks and ruffled petals are indeed some of the most common mutations that occur, for example, when plant breeders try to induce them using things such as gamma radiation. So is it more about the function of the characteristics that are available to play with, rather than the aesthetic goal they are actively working towards? Or is it just the thirst for novelty? If all you are searching for is something that stands out as visually different in a sea of thousands of identical plants on a breeding bench, maybe that starts to take precedence over something that actually looks good. Who knows? It’s so depressing to see such a diverse range of plants, from begonias and fuchsias to petunias, that look so impossibly elegant, exotic and, above all, different from each other in the wild, all being turned into the same frilly, marshmallowy, pompoms that are virtually interchangeable. They aren’t just in horrible taste, they all look the flipping same. Am I alone in wondering this? Or have a I just become one of the terribly opinionated gardening snobs I have always tried my best to avoid?

1/2/2022,"On my parents’ mantelpiece, among the pictures of smiling grandchildren, lopsided graduation hats, old sports cars and a young soldier in smart uniform, is a picture of heroic athletic endeavour. In a little silver frame is a small blond boy in a white vest straining every sinew as he belts around the corner of a grassy athletic field, the parallel lines of the track marked out in white chalk stretching into the distance. He seems to be so far ahead of the pack that he’s almost on his own. He’s a champion in the making! Is the podium ready? Is that the music from Chariots of Fire you can hear? The sad truth is that the little boy is me and I was so far off the pace everyone else that my dad was able to step out on the track to take the picture. “You were miles behind. It was almost as if you were running in slow motion,” he says now, with a laugh.  I must have been about eight years old. I remember the day so clearly. My teeth aren’t clenched with the exertion of the race, but because I was terrified I was about to burst into tears. My cheeks burned more than my thighs did, but all for nothing. I can still recall the journey home, gazing enviously at the brace of medals my brother had picked up – as he always did. “Speedy Pete” we called him. Today, I have a shoebox full of medals tucked under my bed. My hidden vice is that even now, at the boyish age of 56, I like to get them out and jangle them across my palms, let them swing around my neck. But thinking back, it’s that little photo that captures one of the most inspiring moments of my sporting life. I didn’t give up. I was last, but I finished the race. And I’ve never stopped – until now. Today, I still love running. Exercise plays a huge part in my life, both physically and mentally. Exertion keeps me ticking over and helps me tackle the mundanities of the daily grind. It keeps me up when I feel down. It’s the wellspring of my wellbeing. Running, swimming, cycling… I’m like a wild-eyed hamster on speed, spinning away on my various wheels, mostly getting nowhere. But through my perpetual motion I get to stay balanced in one place. I’ve run dozens of marathons (38 to be precise – marathon runners never lose count, they always know), I’ve cycled the length and breadth of Britain (and France, and Spain, and a bit of Holland), I’ve never passed a body of water without an overwhelming urge to strip off and dive in… So why then, as the pandemic took hold of the country, did I come to a shuddering stop? As others got started, I ground to a halt. The parks filled with joggers, sitting rooms everywhere were a blur of squats and burpees, but I couldn’t be fagged to walk to the end of the garden and back. I want to know where my motivation went? And, more importantly, how can I get it back again? On a cold and crisp morning in December I visit the deterministically named Max Sharp. I toy with asking him how I can “max up my sharpness”, but instead settle for an elbow bump and a hello. Sharp, 51, is the owner and manager of the FitFor gym and rehabilitation centre on Lordship Lane in south London. There’s an encouraging sign on the door as you go in that states: “Do Not Enter if you are showing any signs of Covid, Racism or Homophobia.” As you’d hope from a man who spends most of his time in and around gyms, Sharp looks fit, energetic and… well, sharp. He also seems very calm. He says his guilty secret is that he still plays competitive rugby every weekend, to the horror of his partner. “In the last few years, I’ve broken more bones on the pitch than you’d believe. But I just can’t stop,” he adds with a smile. “Just before the first lockdown,” Sharp tells me, “gym membership across the country was at about 15%. That’s the highest it’s ever been. Then Lockdown One happened and there was a wave of enthusiasm with everyone running around, doing exercise videos at home, and getting outside for that one precious walk a day we were allowed. In Lockdown Two that exercise effect was less pronounced, but it was still there. Then Lockdown Three happened and everyone seemed to just give up. Sitting at home eating crisps and drinking beer was our top choice.” Why did that happen? “I think it was because we all got progressively more pissed off, more housebound, more reclusive,” Sharp says, “and that then had an incipient effect on our general motivation. We all shrank. Our outlook shrank, too.” That makes sense, but the big question, of course, is how can we put that into reverse? I’m hoping there is a large switch hidden deep inside our brains that can be flicked back on, like an old fuse box, and start us leaping off sofas again, swapping packets of biscuits for a ton of crunches. Sharp shakes his head. Sadly that’s not the case. But there are things we can do to kickstart the motivation revolution. The lucky ones are already “gym evangelists,” he says. “These are the hardcore people who simply snap back.” They will get their exercise fix whatever. They will always find a way to get a session in. “But they are the minority – the challenge comes in encouraging the rest of us, who know we should exercise, who know there are clear health benefits, who want to come back and want to keep coming back, but just don’t.” It’s a cliché of exercise that the “first step is the hardest”. That short walk from your front door to the park, or the gym, or the pool or the pitch can have more insurmountable obstacles on it than the most exhausting Tough Mudder event. Forget rope nets, hero walls and muddy trenches, putting away the shopping or tidying up the spice rack, even gazing out the window can pose a far greater hurdle to you pulling on your trainers and jogging round the block. “The people who are hardest to motivate,” says Sharp, “are those who don’t have exercise in their experience or understanding, who dislike the very idea of exertion.” For them, it’s usually a life event that triggers an interest. It’s often a health warning, for them or a family member, that gets them going. But even a growing awareness that you are more out of breath at the top of the stairs or can’t dig the garden without putting your back out, can be enough to act as a wake-up call. If you hear that alarm, pay attention. It might just turn your life around. And from a public health standpoint, there is growing evidence that even doing light exercise, breaking up the sedentary time with a little walk, can be beneficial. It doesn’t always have to be about exertion. In an unexpected way the pandemic gave many of us a chance to start again, just as the New Year always does. New Year, New You, and all that. Covid allowed us to adjust our routines and try a fresh approach. Motivation is a battle between life choices and time demands: the siren call of the pub vs the dread of another bums-and-tums class. During the various lockdowns we didn’t have much to do. The endless competition for our time stopped. There was a lot less either or. There was also a generalised feeling that we should try to get fit in the face of a health emergency to give ourselves a fighting chance. But once the novelty of a new beginning grows stale, a very different type of motivation is needed to keep going. As we slowly returned to normality and the temptations of restaurants, clubs and cinemas came back into play, our newfound exercise evangelism got zipped back into a smelly gym bag and forgotten about. Staying motivated about motivation is challenging. But one person knows a lot more about it than most. Joan Duda is professor of sport and exercise psychology at the University of Birmingham. She’s spent the past 25 years working with all levels of athletes and performers, on the “determinants of adherence and optimal functioning in sport, exercise, and dance”. She is also the founder of Empowering Coaching, training programmes for coaches, instructors and parents regarding how to “create more optimally motivating environments and experiences”. I am confident that she will have much to tell me – a middle-aged man who has lost his mojo for plodding round the park. “We know from our research,” Professor Duda tells me, “that if you participate for autonomous reasons – because you want to rather than because you feel you have to, then you are much more likely to maintain physical activity. It is also important to engage because the activity is enjoyable or helps you realise personally valued goals.” Umm, does she mean it should be fun? “That would help!” she says. “We are more likely to keep moving if we can find activities that are fun, interesting, perhaps personally challenging and we can see ourselves improving. And, of course, moving doesn’t need to be exhausting to be beneficial. Just getting outside and taking a walk with the dog or going on a bike ride with friends can bring on our inner smile and give us energy.” When it comes to long-term motivation, Professor Duda and her fellow researchers are becoming increasingly aware that self-identity is also a big deciding factor. If you see yourself as a runner, an exerciser, a person who goes to gyms and leads a healthy life, it’s much easier to live up to those ideals. Instead of “doing” exercise, we need to think of ourselves as “being” a person who is physically active. It is part of who we are; part of our life. These “be” motives are less mentally exhausting than “should” motives. It all sounds rather Buddhist, but you need to embrace your “I am an active person” identity. This identity can take years to develop. Sharp tells me that he has clients who come to his gym three or four times a week and still tell him “that they aren’t really people who go to the gym”. I’m still not sure what’s happened to my motivation, though. I like exercise and I see myself as an “exerciser”. More than that, taking part in exercise has brought me so many happy experiences. It’s also the foundation of some of my most enduring and rewarding friendships. I understand the health benefits it brings. I know I’ll feel better if I go for a run, no matter what the weather or how bad the hangover. Joggers like to gee themselves up by saying things like: “You never regret a run!” and “Find your happy pace!” And that inner voice has always been enough to get me up and out there, but recently the urge to pull on my trainers has petered out. I can’t be bothered any more. It’s a matter of routine, says Sharp. “When you are in the habit, your endocrine system kicks in. Your body gives you a dopamine hit that you soon get hooked on. It’s good stuff. If that goes, it’s hard to find it again. But it’s just a habit that you need to reacquire. And habits take time and a bit of grunt. We’ve been forced into a cosy state of hibernation over the past two years. We need to return to our old patterns.” Sharp tells me in simple terms: “If you start again you’ll soon find your body’s hormonal system will reward you and it will become easier and easier to keep it up.” Not for nothing is Nike’s slogan still: “Just do it.” I decide to speak to an old friend named Graham. He’s a former county-lever runner and as far as I know has never taken a break from running. “That’s not true,” he tells me. “I often stop, or take breaks. Honestly, I just get bored of it sometimes. So I stop for a few days or a few weeks, but then something changes – it might be the weather or I’ll hear a piece of music – and I feel that itch to get back out there.” “I’ve lost my itch,” I tell him mournfully. Graham laughs and points out that when he’s injured it’s awful to start with. “I feel frustrated and irritated.” But after a while he seems to be able to shut off his “running need”. The problem then “is relocating it when I’ve recovered and I’m back on my feet”. I know what he means and realise that, over the years, perhaps unconsciously, I have done similar things. I’ll enter an event that forces me to train and so get back into my groove; or I’ll treat myself to new shoes and feel I should go running so they aren’t wasted. I’ll watch a trail race on YouTube and fantasise about running stride for stride with the best. And, inevitably, I’ll find that itch and that will get me going again. Towards the end of December, my 20-year-old daughter sends me a snap from university. She is at Oxford and has discovered that the track across the road from her student accommodation is not just any track, it’s where Roger Bannister broke the 4-minute mile in 1954. And there it is, suddenly I feel a familiar tingle. I realise this is exactly what I’ve been waiting for. The track is open to members who can also sign in a guest, so on a blustery afternoon the two of us wander across the grass to the famous 400m track. We decide to run a mile. We don’t bother setting a timer, no records are going to fall. We trot round laughing brightly under a grey sky. It’s fantastic. I feel my legs stretch and my chest start to rise and fall. It’s wonderful to be running on this fabled surface. But more importantly, it’s even better to hear the old familiar rumble of motivation in the distance… Five ways to rediscover (and keep) your mojo1. Do something you like Choose a sport or activity that suits you. It’s so much easier to do something you enjoy. Many gyms offer taster weeks where you can sample lots of classes. Do what you want to rather than what you think you should. You’ll be more likely to stick with a sport you like.2. Good or bad doesn’t matter Don’t worry what level you are at. Think of yourself as a physically active person. Walk when you can; take the stairs not the lift. Choose the active option whenever you can.3. Make it simple Get your kit ready beforehand. Choose a time of day that works for you. Find a friend or “gym buddy” to go with. When you finish, schedule the next session. No excuses.4. Think about numbers Tracker apps and biofeedback tech can be motivational. Men in particular seem to do more exercise if they can track it.5. Habit of a lifetime Make exercise part of your routine. Be an exerciser. You’ve got this! Whether it’s cooking something delicious, being more playful or dancing on your own, experts from all walks of life explain how to maintain your motivation. By Michael Segalov It doesn’t matter if it’s your work or not, it is important to practise a skill. Not something you are necessarily good at but something that you get better at, something that takes skill and concentration but you can do it and almost automatically. In other words, we need to find something that gives us a sense of flow. Flow is a concept that the psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi came up with. It is a state achieved when you are absorbed in a task, so much so that the outside world seems to diminish. The trick is to balance your skill with the challenge of the task. If it’s too difficult you get frustrated, too easy and you get bored – to be in flow we need to find that sweet spot in the middle. Sometimes this is called being in “the zone”. The activity that gets you there should be done for its own sake, because it feels good to do it. One of the concepts I use in my psychotherapy practice is that of internal and external referencing. When we internally reference we are noticing how what we are doing feels to us alone; when we externally reference, we are more concerned about how it appears to others. To be in flow, we need to internally reference, this is not about how results look to others but how we feel when we are absorbed in the activity itself. Many things have brought me to a state of flow from learning to bake, to writing my column, or more recently, picking up where I left off at art school and developing my painting skills. The point of whatever activity you do is to enjoy it because of the satisfaction of focusing on the task in hand and being absorbed by it. Everyone could do with developing this type of enjoyment in their lives. It shouldn’t be a luxury. I used to have a very serious eating disorder, so I’m vigilant about food and language: the idea that some food is clean and other dirty is dangerous – it’s not a healthy way to think about our bodies, eliciting guilt. Too often when people want to eat “healthily”, they take out all the fun from food. Inevitably, it can’t be sustained. Instead, this January, reinvigorate how you eat by adding colour, and taking time. If you wear bright colours, you feel uplifted. The same applies to eating food: eat browns and greys, you’ll feel that way. Colours bring a joyful vibrancy to your plate, and they’re also a great way to broaden your imagination, helping you identify what’s missing from a meal. A dash of orange gives you squashes, gourds and pumpkins; spinach and chard adds a burst of green. I tend to make a five-day soup to see me through the week in winter – deeply flavoured broths which warm you inside and out. After Christmas, I take the bones and roast them to extract all the flavour, starting a stock by adding everything that’s going a little moody in the fridge. I have a bowl next to the cooker for all my vegetable peelings and chuck that in with garlic, aromatics and herbs. Take your time, let it simmer for hours. You’ll start to feel better as the smell flows around your home. This is your base for an entire week of meals. Food shouldn’t be a place of flagellation, but jubilation. The nutrients shoot to your brain, the warmth will physically soothe you, and the act of making something beautiful will fill your soul once more. When the world feels cold and dark, you need to give yourself love and tenderness. Food is the perfect place to start. Staying silly has always been important to me, it comes from my strong sense of the absurd. The way I see it, there really isn’t much reason why we’re on Earth. When we’re focused entirely on daily troubles and chores, we don’t notice it’s all ultimately pointless. So why not try to look for fun while it lasts? It’s easy to be drawn into the doom of human existence. I have to remind myself that there’s no point to spending a life being totally miserable. You may as well enjoy it before we inevitably die. At times, that can be hard. I had Covid, and struggled afterwards. I knew the world before I became ill. I’d become accustomed to my senses of sound and sight. The virus damaged my eye and ear, and so the world changed, becoming fragmented. At first, it was hard not to think of the world as having been spoiled. Instead, I now focus on how strange it is that my perceptions have changed after so many decades. Deciphering the world is a whole new challenge, it needn’t be melancholic. It’s an adventure, a strange new game. Play, for me, is what makes life bearable, when we’re walking, shopping, working, letting our minds run free and wild. For me, much of the time, that means playing with words. I discovered when my son died that I’m less bothered by things if I write about them. Some are straightforwardly lighthearted and jolly. But penning a poem about sadness or a sense of loss can leave you feeling better as well. It helps, laying things down on paper. I call it “unfolding”. Everyone can do this, it doesn’t take expertise. Think of it as doodling, but with words. There’s a tyranny to education: learning to write frees you, but we’re restricted by being taught that formal sentences are all that’s worthwhile. Instead, scribble down fragments – think up half-lines mixed with song lyrics, lines from films, things people say. Don’t overthink it – it’s like talking with your pen. This process is a liberation for the mind. It’s our primal right to move – that’s always my starting point with the people I work with. It doesn’t matter what your movement looks like; you don’t need to look like anyone else. My mom has owned a ballet school for decades. When I was little, she wouldn’t let me into her class because she wanted me to learn to move in my own body before anyone else told me how to. Today, if you feel you don’t know how to move, find a place to be alone and turn on your music. However awkward or embarrassed you feel, don’t stop until something makes you want to move. Exercise helps with depression and anxiety. From sex to energy, creativity to contentment, exercise is the fastest way to give your body a boost. Stepping into something that’s formalised will help you keep your efforts up. I sometimes think it helps to think of yourself as a child, but also the parent: would you let a kid you are responsible for sit around staring at screens and eating sugar all day? In which case, why let yourself? Resilience is a state of mind, not something you’re born with. Look at top athletes, who train hard and commit completely: if they didn’t give a toss, they’d fail. As a mountaineer, you realise this quickly – there’s no special quality you possess which helps you, but a skillset developed over many years. You know you can endure because you have specific knowledge and experience, technical knowhow and trust in your team. Much of mountaineering results in failure – you’re at the mercy of the elements over which you have no control. The first thing a climber does after something goes wrong is analyse what happened. What went right? What didn’t? What can I learn? There’s no reason why we shouldn’t apply this logic to all walks of life. It might not sound sexy, but resilience comes from hard graft. Losing teaches us a huge amount. And when something really bad happens, like when I had my own near-fatal fall in Peru in the 1980s, focusing on the small things was enough to keep me going. Right, I’d say to myself, let’s not die today. That was a victory enough. I’d repeat the same thing the next day. It’s when we’re up against it that we remember we are designed to survive.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Lost your get up and go?

1/2/2022,"After a surprisingly lavish summer it’s hard to see Silent Stan sliding down the chimney with a bag full of swag for a January blowout. But, unless Gabriel Martinelli can be converted into a centre‑forward, it’s asking a lot for the youngsters to keep shouldering the scoring burden – hence the links with Dusan Vlahovic and Mason Greenwood. With players off to the Africa Cup of Nations, we might well need bolstering in midfield, too: Milan’s Franck Kessié, Renato Sanches from Lille and Leipzig’s Tyler Adams are on the radar.   Bernard Azulay goonersdiary.co.uk @GoonerN5 It’s hard to know what’s on Steven Gerrard’s mind but I doubt we’ll be overly active: we’re gaining coherence on the park and can wait to the summer. Lazy journalists/click-baiters have us “raiding” Rangers but that’s unlikely, and it’d be pretty low behaviour. We probably need cover at full‑back and at No 6, though, and of course there’s always room for top players, even if it meant moving on good servants such as Trézéguet and El Ghazi. Poaching Sarr or Saint‑Maximin would be coups. Unlikely, yes, but I’d be thrilled.  Jonathan Pritchard We don’t usually dabble in January given the prices, but we do need depth at right-back and, having not replaced Saïd Benrahma, a left winger. We’ve a couple of bids out on players, so fingers crossed. It’s been interesting to see how we’re spreading our net further: usually our transfer targets are in Denmark or France, now it’s Brazil, Ukraine and, er, Nottingham. The number of ins and outs will depend on when players are due back from injury, but keeper Jonas Lössl is joining on loan to tide us over. Marcus Forss and Dominic Thompson could go out on loan.  Billy Grant Beesotted podcast and blog; @Beesotted; @BillyTheBee99 It looks like Aaron Connelly is off on loan: he won’t be missed, and nor would Jürgen Locadia if only we could get rid of him. We need to keep hold of everyone else. Lewis Dunk’s knee injury might force us to buy, but Leo Östigard is back from Stoke. And do we need a striker? I’m not convinced – I love watching Neal Maupay cause havoc: he has seven goals and we’ve got a great new song for him. Plus Danny Welbeck seems to be fit again. Anyway, I’m sure Tony Bloom will do the right thing and Graham Potter will make it work.  Steph Fincham We have players out of contract next summer but we really can’t afford to allow any of them to go early given our current position. And in terms of signings, the two problem areas are central midfield and up front. If we could bring in one for each position, that would be progress. But who? Ross Barkley has been linked as a potential loan while Sunderland’s Dan Neil is apparently a target. This window is one we should use for immediate first‑team strengthening, so I wouldn’t question a couple of good loans.  Tony Scholes UpTheClarets.com, @utcdotcom Due to injuries and Covid we could do with cover for Chilwell, Alonso and Kanté. Monaco midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni has been linked – he looks extremely promising – while Milan’s Theo Hernández has been mentioned as a potential full-back option. I can’t see much activity beyond that, though. It looks like the club are holding fire on centre‑backs until all the contract issues are resolved. I’d be surprised to see any exits: we definitely have a big squad but we’ve been badly hit by injuries and Covid, so can’t really afford to let anyone go.  Paul Baker in memory of Trizia Fiorellino We went big in the summer so I’m not expecting much this month. If Jes Rak-Sakyi continues not to get a first-team chance then I expect he’ll go out on loan and, despite his goal against Norwich, it really hasn’t worked out here for Jean-Philippe Mateta: his loan could be ended early. If that happens then we’ll perhaps look to replace him in the squad with the Real Madrid striker Borja Mayoral, currently on loan at Roma, with whom we have been linked for months, or Arsenal’s Eddie Nketiah. But any major activity is likely to wait until the summer.  Chris Waters @Clapham_Grand We’re still constrained by previous losses, so signings depend on sales. It seems Digne is off after his falling-out with Benítez, which will generate much-needed trading profits. Bringing in Vitaliy Mykolenko, 22, from Dynamo Kyiv to replace the 28-year-old looks like good business. Signing right-back Nathan Patterson from Rangers to replace Séamus Coleman still depends on negotiating phased payments. And with several players in the last six months of their contracts, there’s potential for loans out, and thus loans in.  The Esk TheEsk.org; @TheEsk Michaël Cuisance failed a medical. Conor Gallagher preferred Palace. Huddersfield asked too much for Lewis O’Brien. Leeds have been looking for a new midfielder since promotion, but were relaxed about actually finding one. Until now. Now they’re very stressed about it! Or they should be. With more players in the treatment room than points in the league, Marcelo Bielsa and director of football Victor Orta need to get over their queasiness about January shopping. Bielsa is said to like Reading’s John Swift; West Yorkshire’s collective heart rate just needs somebody. As long as they don’t immediately get injured, they’ll do us.  Daniel Chapman thesquareball.net; @MoscowhiteTSB Main priority: a new set‑piece coach. Honestly, we should spend £50m on it, or whatever it takes … Beyond that, with injuries and Covid ravaging the squad, we face the daunting prospect of having no senior centre-backs or centre-forwards this month. It seemed unthinkable a few weeks ago given the form of Daka, Vardy and Iheanacho but yet another striker may need to be recruited. And at centre-back, the need to spend is just as clear. Tarkowski is always mentioned, but the dirty money on Tyneside will probably talk louder.  Chris Whiting clippings.me/chriswhiting; @ChrisRWhiting Up front is one area we should probably be looking at this month – as crazy as that sounds right now. West Ham’s Jarrod Bowen doesn’t score enough goals yet, but at 25 he’s reaching his prime and would only improve with great players around him. Central midfield too. Leicester’s Youri Tielemans continues to be linked with us and would fit right in, as would Leeds’ Raphinha. Though following the defeat at Leicester, it’s obvious we need to dive into the transfer market and buy, buy, buy!  Steph Jones The chances of us signing anyone look close to nil – Pep has confirmed as much. But Ferran Torres leaving concerns me from a numbers perspective, particularly as Mahrez is off to the Africa Cup of Nations. The candidates to come in as a top‑class No 9 remain pretty obvious: Erling Haaland, Harry Kane and Dusan Vlahovic – but will those guys move mid-season? My other concern is the lack of cover for Rodri. Fernandinho is a bona fide club legend but age has finally caught up with him.  Lloyd Scragg ninetythreetwenty.com; @lloyd_scragg Where do you start? Persisting with a José-era midfield was a mistake. Last season we should have asked PSG for a Pogba/Verratti swap, but I think that ship has sailed. Declan Rice would be great, but West Ham are in a strong position not to sell. The defence needs sorting again, too. Ezri Konsa at Villa looks promising: Ralf Rangnick has a reputation for developing young players and Konsa looks quality at 24. As for players to sell? Jones, Pogba, Martial and the English lionheart hype job Harry Maguire.  Shaun O’Donnell It’s going to be a tough window given our position, but it’s good to see us linked with quality in Jesse Lingard and Kieran Trippier. Most important, there’s no room for mercenaries in our relegation fight: players must be prepared to run through brick walls for the shirt. With Wilson’s injury, two strikers are a priority, as is an experienced centre-half and a commanding midfielder who can grab a game by the scruff of the neck. Peripheral players such as Jeff Hendrick should be moved on – if there are any takers.  David and Richard Holmes Given our estimated £0 transfer pot, expectations are pretty limited. Sporting director Stuart Webber has made clear we have to sell to buy and, quite frankly, aside from Max Aarons, who’s going to want any of our players? There’s little stomach in the club for the fight to stay up, so this window looks more about getting ready for another crack at the Championship. What we need above all is to give Teemu Pukki some competition, but with our budget that’s nigh on impossible. Happy days at the Carra!  Gary Gowers myfootballwriter.com; @Gary_Gowers; @MFW_NCFC I’d be surprised if we’re particularly busy: there generally isn’t a lot of value in January. But with both keepers injured to varying degrees and Willy Caballero on a short-term deal, I imagine we’ll be looking for another. Fraser Forster will go on a free in the summer, but Alex McCarthy signed a new three-year deal recently, so it’ll be interesting to see if we look for a genuine first choice: there’s not really been a great deal between McCarthy and Forster. Sam Johnstone or Dean Henderson would fit the bill.  Steve Grant SaintsWeb.co.uk; @SteveGrant1983 Spurs are always linked to dozens of players, but it feels like Milan’s Franck Kessié is a real target, albeit as a pre-contract for the summer. As for Matthijs de Ligt? Dreamy. We’d need oligarch levels of funding, though. I trust in Fabio Paratici’s and Antonio Conte’s current process of reinvention and elimination, with Dele and Winks perhaps able to save themselves. We do need bolstering in midfield if Ndombele can’t adapt or Lo Celso can’t remain fit. And Fiorentina striker Dusan Vlahovic would be the ultimate chef’s kiss.  Spooky dearmrlevy.com; thefightingcock.co.uk; @spooky23 Priorities for recruitment are defensive: we need a left-back and a centre-back. At least one of those also needs to be a leader and an organiser, and both need to be bloody-minded and shouty. John McClelland and Tony Coton achieved this in 1984, Colin Foster and Keith Millen in 1994, so we’re overdue a defensive revolution. As for exits: it’s hard to see anyone going given Covid and that we’ll be losing a significant proportion of our first-teamers to the Africa Cup of Nations – but Ozan Tufan’s loan isn’t really working out for anybody.  Matt Rowson bhappy.wordpress.com; @mattrowson We desperately need a striker to deputise for Antonio and give him a break late in games. Maybe new part-owner Daniel Kretinsky can help with his Czech contacts. And with Ogbonna and Zouma injured the other urgent need is for a centre-back – James Tarkowski, or maybe Nat Phillips might benefit from regular football. In midfield, re-signing Jesse Lingard would be a coup as Fornals is toiling and Benrahma is away in Africa for January. And if Cresswell is out for any longer, a loan for a left‑back might be necessary.  Pete May Author, Goodbye to Boleyn; hammersintheheart.blogspot.co.uk We need goals, but that doesn’t necessarily mean strikers. Adding one or two midfielders/defenders with greater mobility could allow us to ditch the back three and have an extra attacker on the pitch. Lille’s Renato Sanches and Sven Botman could fit the bill. Funding those deals could mean offloading Adama Traoré: he’s into the last 18 months of his contract and it doesn’t seem like he’s going to sign a new one. It would be a shame, but if it allows us to create a more fully formed squad, it might be a price worth paying.

1/2/2022,"There’s something propulsively intoxicating about the films of Paul Thomas Anderson. Watching Punch-Drunk Love left me in exactly the state described by the title; Inherent Vice demanded to be inhaled rather than watched; I wanted to wrap myself in the poisonous couture of Phantom Thread. Anderson’s latest takes its title from a hip record store (reportedly named after an Abbott and Costello gag), and appropriately enough the result spun me round like a record. This is heady stuff, an evocation of the San Fernando valley in the early 70s, as personally nostalgic as George Lucas’s American Graffiti, albeit with an insanely adventurous edge. Screen newcomer Cooper Hoffman (son of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) is Gary Valentine, a high-schooler with a Brian Wilson haircut who’s also a child actor and go-getting entrepreneur. “Where are your parents while all this is happening?” asks Alana (musician and feature first-timer Alana Haim), the twentysomething Gary meets when she’s working as an assistant to the school photographer, and whom he declares to be “the girl I’m going to marry one day”, despite her insistence that “we are not boyfriend and girlfriend”.  When Gary needs a chaperone to accompany him to a New York TV special, Alana (upon whose expressively reactive face the movie rests) goes along for the ride, only to fall for his fantastically smug co-star Lance (Skyler Gisondo). But Gary has his sights set on higher things – a waterbed business (“liquid luxury for you!”) in which Alana becomes his partner, keeping them together even as she insists that they will never be “together”. Partly inspired by the early-life adventures of film and TV producer Gary Goetzman, Licorice Pizza pinballs between seemingly random episodes, taking us from a teenage fair (where John C Reilly cameos as Herman Munster) to the Encino hills via fiery motorcycle stunts with movie stars (Sean Penn as a William Holden-esque screen veteran) and close calls with police and politicians (Benny Safdie as mayoral hopeful Joel Wachs) – all played out against the end-of-days background noise of the Opec oil crisis. There’s also a completely unhinged encounter with Jon Peters, the hairdresser turned producer whom Bradley Cooper plays as a wild-eyed cross between Charles Manson and Hart Bochner’s sleazy executive from Die Hard. Bizarrely, what begins as a reprise of the drug-crazed Alfred Molina scene from Boogie Nights mutates unexpectedly into an LA-bound remake of The Wages of Fear, with kids instead of dynamite as the truck’s volatile cargo. What keeps it all grounded is the fact that, in the midst of all this madness, our central odd couple remain entirely believable. From the strangely infantalising hubbub of Alana’s family (played by Haim’s real-life relatives) to Gary’s peculiar half-man/half-boy existence, Licorice Pizza makes us accept a relationship that has something of the dysfunctional charm of Hal Ashby’s Harold and Maude. As for the eclectic jukebox soundtrack, in which tunes such as the Chico Hamilton Quintet’s Blue Sands play contrapuntally across tone-shifting scenes, that put me in mind of Ashby’s other masterpiece, Coming Home. “Do you think it’s weird that I hang out with Gary and his friends all the time?” Alana asks in a moment of blazed reflection, wondering how she wound up with a bunch of 15-year-olds. “It’s whatever you think it is,” comes the reply – and it’s a credit to the movie that we tend to agree. Elsewhere, there’s a divisively absurdist turn by John Michael Higgins as the proprietor of a Japanese restaurant, whose language skills extend only to a pantomime accent, and a killer appearance by Harriet Sansom Harris as agent Mary Grady, who tells Alana: “You remind me of an English pit-bull dog, with sex appeal and a very Jewish nose.” But this is Gary and Alana’s movie, and it’s them that we will remember: his open-faced smile; her left-handed scowl; the giddy way they run through streets together. “How did we survive?” asks Gary after one particularly reckless episode, a question most of us have surely asked ourselves. Like all the best evocations of times past, Licorice Pizza has no answers – only an enraptured sense of awe that makes Anderson’s joyous film feel like a very personal memory.",Arts/Film,Licorice Pizza – Paul Thomas Anderson’s joyously nostalgic coming-of-age tale,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/02/licorice-pizza-paul-thomas-andersons-joyously-nostalgic-coming-of-age-tale
1/2/2022,"Ihave an Auld Lang Syne earworm, a hangover from a New Year I didn’t even celebrate. I usually eschew the Hootenanny and head to bed at 10.30, shove in earplugs and wait for the firework-loathing dog to slink in, poke his bony elbows into my kidneys and breathe his foul kipper breath over my face. My signature New Year cocktail is three parts relief to two of fomo with a smugness garnish as I wake early and contemplate stripping the house of every glittering shred of festivity, a prospect somehow as appealing as decorating it a few weeks previously. (I revert to puritanical zealot instantly after New Year, grimly relishing the dark months of fingerless gloves and gruel, while my French husband tries in vain to make his decadent, continental epiphany happen, with its greasy wodge of almond galette, filling-menacing charm, and paper crown.) Even so, something about that “old acquaintance” part is stuck in my head, displacing my usual involuntary theme tune (Kung Fu Fighting – you’re welcome). I think a lot about “old acquaintance” at the moment. Partly, it’s because returning to my home town three years ago means I live in a nostalgia minefield, everywhere liable to detonate a tiny, usually benign, charge of emotion. The waiter from the pizzeria we went to when my mother couldn’t face cooking is still waitering a few hundred yards away; my biology teacher is teaching my son biology; my schoolfriends’ parents still live in the same streets. At choir practice a woman I did not recognise came over with a card with a cat on. “Do you recognise this cat?” she asked. I didn’t, but it was a birthday card addressed to me, with a 1980s postmark. It had, she said, been kicking around her house for decades, and she had no idea why. I would have run a mile from that feeling of being held in a web of connectedness even a decade ago, but now it’s comforting to be seen and known.  But it’s also the times, I think. Isolation, pent-up boredom, a hunger for humans other than our cohabitees and that wave of lockdown nostalgia for a time before LFTs and social distancing, back when QR codes were still as ridiculous as Google Glass, have conspired to make “absent friends” an urgent project rather than a vague regret. Surely it’s no coincidence that last year saw both the Friends and the Sex and the City reunions: we’re hungry for reassurance that even when we need reading glasses and HRT or end up looking like Matt LeBlanc, ressembling a benign, slightly confused Irish uncle, we still remain ourselves, that we can still slip into well-worn grooves of connection. A university friend, a primary school classmate and a former neighbour made contact last year, conjuring names I did not know I remembered until I heard them again. I have found myself thinking about my own ones that got away: schoolfriends and colleagues from crappy jobs, doomed dates or group therapy fellow travellers. My new phone backed up recently to a contacts list that is a blast from the past in itself: I scroll through it in baffled wonder. Who was “Liam’s Dad” or “Matthew handyman”? Is Elke still working in Brussels airport? How is my son’s speech therapist from 2008 doing, or the dogsitter from 2010 who sent me a picture of the dog on a sofa eating pâté on toast for Christmas dinner (no wonder life with me is a grave disappointment for him since)? I don’t think we necessarily want, or need, to rekindle most of these relationships. They were often a product of geography and circumstance that has shifted. It’s more about exploring the tendrils of connection and reassuring ourselves that we are still social creatures. In 1993, anthropologist Robin Dunbar set a figure for how many meaningful relationships our neocortex can maintain: 150 (though Swedish research last year argued we can manage far more). I doubt many of us are maintaining anywhere near that many IRL connections at the moment, but our “Dunbar’s number” is bolstered by memories and virtual connections we nourish. Remembering getting so drunk with Caro that I had to leave the Woman in White after 10 minutes, or sprinting through Barcelona airport with Nic when we spent too long buying cakes (is that the equivalent of Robbie Burns’s “ran about the braes”?), feels comforting, like turning on lights in a half-empty house. That was Burns’s point, I think: the not forgetting matters; the “brought to mind”. But if there is an old acquaintance you think about a lot or a missed connection you regret, perhaps don’t assume they will drift back into your life when, or if, it’s meant to be. I got a message this week that Fred, an exuberant, intermittent presence in my life from 10 or so years ago, a warm, flawed, funny man with an irrepressible appetite for creating quotidian drama, had died. Of course, the memories are still there, but for the ones that really matter, send the awkward message; share the cringey reminiscence.

1/2/2022,"The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) is on course for the highest annual fundraising total in its near 200-year history. Donations swelled after the charity attracted huge public support following rightwing attacks for helping save the lives of asylum seekers at risk of drowning in the Channel. The RNLI said it has received a significant increase in support, with online donations rising by 50% this year.  Founded in 1824, the UK’s network of volunteer lifeboats has been inundated with donations and messages of support after high-profile attacks from individuals such as Nigel Farage and elements of the media, who have called the charity “woke” for fulfilling its humanitarian mission to save lives at sea. Their claims are believed to have encouraged a group of fishermen who in November allegedly attempted to block a lifeboat from going to the Channel to rescue asylum seekers, days before 27 people drowned in the Channel. Jayne George, the RNLI’s fundraising director, said that such hostility appeared to have had the opposite effect to what its architects would have wanted. “We’ve had a better response to almost everything that we’ve done in 2021. At the end of the year, we’re going to have more members, we’re going to have more cash donors and more people who give to us via direct debit,” she said.George added that the charity’s database of supporters had also grown appreciably, with the organisation now in regular contact with 300,000 people. Channel crossings have become one of the most politicised issues in British politics, with the home secretary, Priti Patel, staking her reputation on making the route “unviable” yet unable to prevent almost 28,000 people arriving in small boats in 2021, compared with just over 8,400 the previous year. Her controversial borders bill intends to reduce such numbers and contained, until recently, proposals that appeared to criminalise organisations such as the RNLI for rescuing asylum seekers in the Channel. “We can’t help but notice that it’s a really divisive issue that’s in the news almost daily. Whatever the negatives, the positive is that it brings out this significant reaction in terms of people wanting to support us, particularly our work in the eastern Channel,” said George. She added that the boom in staycations during the pandemic meant more people were exposed to its work than usual: 2020 was one of the charity’s busiest on record, with 8,239 lifeboat launches that assisted 8,374 people and saved 239 lives. The organisation has also noted that support is not just confined to coastal areas. “In fact the majority of our most successful cohorts of fundraisers are in the major cities. We’ve got a Leeds business branch that is really successful and two committees in London that have raised significant sums of money, and also Birmingham as well,” said George. Sunday is the 20th anniversary of lifeboats on the Thames, where they were introduced after the 1989 Marchioness pleasure boat disaster in which 51 people died. Despite repeated assertions from the Home Office that it is heavily targeting small boat crossings, a parliamentary report last month said the government’s operations in the Channel “rely heavily on voluntary organisations, such as the RNLI, or independent lifeboats”. George said: “Our core purpose is humanitarian – we exist to save everyone.”",News/UK news,"After rightwing attacks on rescues, UK lifeboat charity has record fundraising year",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/02/rightwing-attacks-rescues-uk-lifeboat-charity-fundraising-rnli-royal-national-lifeboat-institution
1/2/2022,"With more than one million tickets sold, a host of star athletes signed up, more than 41,000 volunteer applications received and dozens of sold out events, anticipation for the Commonwealth Games in July is high. The games in Birmingham will be the first major international multisport event with spectators since the start of the pandemic, meaning the pressure is on to get it right, but the feeling of excitement is palpable.  “This is the biggest thing that’s going to happen in the UK so people want to get involved,” says Ian Reid, the event’s chief executive. “Considering we started asking people to buy tickets about a year out and with all the uncertainty around Covid, and now we’re sat here having sold over one million tickets, it gives us real comfort that we’re going to have pretty much full stadiums at the vast majority of our events. The city’s going to be really jumping.” Layla Guscoth, who plays netball for England, is one of many athletes who believe the absence of crowds has been a major loss for sporting events since Covid. “The past couple of years have been a bit of a car crash for international sport in terms of restrictions and travelling,” she says. “It’s so exciting to think about having a major championship in England, with spectators, fingers crossed. Hopefully, for a couple of weeks, it can just enthral us all.” The Omicron variant and its implication for international travel and large-scale events has naturally caused organisers some concern, particularly after a period when it seemed the worst of the pandemic was over. “We have invested a huge amount of time, resources and money planning for various Covid scenarios,” says Reid. Welcoming people from abroad is likely to be one of the biggest worries, but organisers are expecting at least 90% of spectators to be from the UK. “There are now safety precautions like [vaccine] passports we can put in place and there’s clearly an advantage of the event taking place in summer. Everyone’s very confident that visitors will be coming to Birmingham, and we will put on a full sport programme with full stadiums,” Reid says. Despite the challenges of organising the event in constantly changing circumstances, the team is aiming for the biggest Commonwealth Games, with 286 sessions of sport in the two-week event. It will also be the first time a multisport event has more medal events for women than men (the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in 2018 had an equal number). It will feature women’s cricket for the first time and T20 cricket makes it debut. “The growth of women’s cricket around the Commonwealth has been incredible,” says Reid. “The International Cricket Council is right behind us, they see this as the biggest event for women’s cricket ever. We’re hoping to put that sport right in the spotlight, and cricket is a Commonwealth sport so the quality will be really high.” The games will also feature more para sports than before and unlike at the Olympics will be fully integrated into the main timetable. Reid says: “We treat every athlete competing in our games exactly the same, they’re on exactly the same stage. We don’t look at it as a para programme and an able-bodied programme, we look at it as a single event. “The great thing about that is we introduce huge numbers of people to elite para sport that perhaps they have not engaged with before, because you may watch an able-bodied 100m race followed by a wheelchair race.” It is being hailed as Birmingham’s big opportunity to showcase itself on the world stage, and building work is increasing rapidly. Alexander Stadium in Perry Barr, which will host the athletics as well as the opening and closing ceremonies, is having a £72m revamp to increase capacity to about 30,000. Sandwell Aquatics Centre is the only venue being built for the games, hosting 11 days of swimming, para swimming and diving, and is due to be completed in the spring. Guscoth, who is from Birmingham, says she is looking forward to the often underrated city welcoming so many visitors. “Birmingham gets put down all the time but it has so much to offer – it’s so vibrant, it’s so multicultural, there’s a huge amount to do,” she says. “I’m pleased the athletics stadium has been rebuilt and other things are popping up around the city which I hope will continue to encourage young people to get involved in sports.” Birmingham has the youngest population of any city in Europe, with under-25s accounting for nearly 40% of its residents, and Reid believes the games will make a real effort to engage with its youthful audience. The city centre Smithfield site will host beach volleyball and, in a first for the Commonwealth Games, 3x3 basketball. “Rather than the traditional 5x5 basketball, 3x3 basketball uses a single net,” says Reid. “It’s a bit more urban, it’s really fast and it’s a really engaging sport, and the fact it’s sold out so quickly shows there’s a huge appetite for it. “There will also be DJs and music performances on that site, much more of a party atmosphere.” Guscoth said the opportunity to inspire young people after two years of Covid is one of the main things she is excited to see. “I’d hate to think how many kids over the last two years have dropped out of sports, because it’s not been there to be played,” she said. “It’s really tough to maintain interest and to keep up with fitness when gyms have been shut and clubs and school sports have been stopped, so hopefully this will reinvest a bit of energy and enthusiasm in sports. “For me, it’s seeing the faces of young women in the crowd and people that I know look up to us as role models. It’s nice to know that the next generation are going to be able to witness that again.” Organisers said ticket sales were given a big boost by the Olympics last summer, which coincided with the launch of the first ticket ballot. A number of athletes who competed in Tokyo, including swimmer Adam Peaty, sprinter Dina Asher-Smith, middle-distance runner Laura Muir and the para sport athlete Kadeena Cox, have signed up to compete. “We’ve undoubtedly been helped by the Tokyo Olympics. People have been watching those athletes compete and then want to watch them in person at a home games,” says Reid. “We just want to put on a really incredible celebration and feel like we’re getting back to, hopefully, some degree of normality.”",Sport/Sport,Commonwealth Games 2022: how Birmingham’s big event is shaping up,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/02/commonwealth-games-2022-how-birminghams-big-event-is-shaping-up
1/2/2022,"If 2020 was a year of fear and isolation, 2021 marked one of return – a road toward something like “normal”, despite so many hairpin turns. The mass distribution of Covid-19 vaccines did not restore the norms of pre-pandemic life, as many had hoped, but it did change the rules of engagement. Time and again, people adapted. As we greet a third calendar year of pandemic life, the Guardian turned to experts across disciplines who have helped the rest of us make sense of the past two years for lessons learned, and wisdom to carry forward.  The experts: Jessica Richards is the founder of the trend forecasting firm JMR Trend + Creative. Sydney Mintle is the founder of fashion marketing and public relations firm Gossip & Glamour. Thomas Plante is a professor of psychology at Santa Clara University. Kelly Hills is a bioethicist and co-founder of the bioethics consulting firm Rogue Bioethics. Barbara J Sahakian is a professor of psychiatry at the University of Cambridge. Saskia Popescu is an infectious disease epidemiologist and assistant professor at the George Mason University Schar School of Policy and Government. What was something you realized in 2021 that you wish you’d known, or done, in 2020? Jessica Richards: My biggest piece of advice to my 2020 self would be to stop planning and just do the next right thing. Sydney Mintle: I now wish someone had told me earlier on to savor the quiet moments of reflection instead of panicking about when things would return to normal. The truth is, there is no “normal” any more and we have to remain agile and imaginative. Kelly Hills: I wish I’d taken the time to plan out the ideal accoutrements for a really comfortable and fun movie-watching experience at home – what it would mean for lighting, sound, seats, even things like the best way to make popcorn or how get that mixed-at-the-tap taste for soda. Maybe even a tap or two for beer and hard cider. A way to replicate what we enjoy about going to the movies, but at home. I realized that there are aspects of the theatre experience I really miss. Thomas Plante: I wished that I knew this was going to go on for so long. I would have bought stock in Zoom! What unexpected lesson have you learned from this long and challenging pandemic, and how has it changed your approach to work or life moving forward? Plante: Politicizing the pandemic, rather than treating it as a public health crisis being guided by public health experts, is something I didn’t see coming. I am more skeptical of people’s ability to think and behave logically. My wife (also a psychologist) and I often find ourselves saying that after being licensed psychologists for over 30 years, we still apparently have much to learn about human behavior. Mintle: The pandemic has shown us that we all truly want to be seen and connected. Whether that’s taking place digitally or in real life, what we missed most during the pandemic was human connection and the opportunity to share ideas. During the pandemic, I joined a book club and started reading books by authors of color that have deeply resonated with me. Seeking to understand different points of view will be critical as we work to navigate the changes ahead in 2022. Barbara J Sahakian: I’ve prioritized putting into practice things that I already knew were good for me, but did not always do because of my busy work routine. I now get more outdoor exercise and have a better work-life balance. And as soon as pandemic lockdowns ended in the UK, I made sure to do more of the things I enjoy: going to the opera, ballet and theatre, and visiting restaurants with friends and family. Saskia Popescu: I’ve realized the importance of communication that isn’t fixated on a timeline, and instead takes into account the ebbs and flows of a public health challenge. I realized that ending the pandemic requires continued buy-in from people who are exhausted, who perhaps haven’t been supported as best they should have, or maybe don’t understand the severity of the situation. As a result, I find it important to have more conversations with members of the public to better understand and address specific, existing concerns. I also learned that no matter how much we may think pandemic response should be simple and straightforward, it will be inherently politicized, nuanced, complicated and require the ability to lean into change and work to ensure trust from the public as a critical resource. Richards: As a trend forecaster, it’s my job to think about what life will be like six months, or a year, or even two years from now. When I kick off a new season, I ask myself a series of leading questions to shape the research, including “Where are we going?” During the pandemic, asking myself that question – and, more importantly, asking the follow-up question: “How will I get there?” – helped lay the groundwork for personal goal setting, too. Though the pandemic was and continues to be so large and all-encompassing, the practice of focused steps, leading to the next, and then the next, feels like a way to keep moving forward.",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘I would have bought stock in Zoom!’: experts on wisdom (and regrets) for a new year of Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/02/wisdom-lessons-regrets-covid-2022
1/2/2022,"If champagne socialism did not have such a bad rap, there should be a decent bottle or two open at Keir Starmer’s place this new year weekend. The party has its first consistent lead over the Conservatives: a seven-point advantage of the kind it requires to turn Labour’s doldrums into territory where it could conceivably claw back an election win from the long-running disaster movie. (The opposition was last in power when Eminem was topping the chart.) To his credit, Starmer has held his nerve in a gruelling house clean after the Corbyn era. Yes, there are still strong far left redoubts in Young Labour and the trade union movement, but the leadership has in essence won a battle to rebalance key roles. Indeed, a revivified Team Keir looks like a centrist revival. Rachel Reeves is an assiduous shadow chancellor who can test Rishi Sunak’s pain threshold this year as concerns over cost of living and failings by the government to offset energy price hikes deepen economic anxieties.  Lisa Nandy is finally in the right job, taking on Michael Gove’s defence of the red wall seats in the elusive “levelling-up” agenda, and Yvette Cooper back to the big screen as a formidable cross-examiner of Priti Patel in home affairs. With fresh blood to public service briefs in Wes Streeting at health and Bridget Phillipson, as one of the front bench’s breakthrough talents, at education, Starmer is well placed to portray his party as ready to do more than carp at the failings of a stressed government. “More people have more doubts about the Tories,” says a message-bearer. “That gives us the chance to start to talk about the alternative and get a hearing.” A Starmer speech promising “security, prosperity and respect” is also intended to offset the impression of being the concerned-but-miserable party. Opposition is about opportunity seized and the Tories have handed Labour a generous bunch of year-end disasters. Revelations of vast carelessness in No 10 about the wisdom of holding parties at the outer edge of the Covid rules, to put it generously, to anticipated strong personal criticism of Johnson’s conduct over loans to refurbish his living quarters when (another) report by Lord Geidt emerges in the next week or so remind us of the omni-mess. Add a byelection defeat in Shropshire of epochal proportions and Labour has clearly gained possession of the political ball by dint of government misjudgements. There are, however, some angostura bitters in this mix. Not to put too fine a point on it, Tories do not fear Keir and until they have reason to do so, Labour’s paper gains and more positive polling will remain unconsolidated. Why might this be? Speaking to Starmer advocates in his inner team, the dominant analysis is that Labour has earned the “right to be heard” in recent weeks: an opening in the public mind to arguments that previously seemed irrelevant. Pollsters for both parties conclude that many Johnson assets have turned sour, flipping into incomprehension or distaste. “It’s a bit like looking at the date you thought was incredibly sexy and great fun when you were 16,” observes one Starmerite. “The things that attracted you to them most are the aspects that in a different light can make you really dislike them later.” Yet to torture the metaphor, the electorate has to date someone and simply finding Johnson to be more peroxide than blond will not necessarily do it for his challenger. Starmer is seen as “decent” (not a Johnson asset) and reliable (ditto). The flipside is he can come across as a bit dull. In contrast to the leader he replaced after the Corbyn rout in 2019, there is something wavering in Starmer’s self-presentation that makes it hard for the public to “get” him . The “old” Starmer, a leftish student activist, is happiest empathising with the afflicted and the “crying injustices” of economic inequality. “New” Starmer needs momentum and some sense of va-va-voom. Crucially, the Starmer creed is gaining apostles. Peter Kyle, one of the veterans of the last Labour government re-establishing themselves as forces in the party, put it well in an interview with the Financial Times last week outlining tactical opportunities and the biggest outstanding task: “Our challenge is to light the fire.” In the coming year, which may well be the last before a general election (Brenda from Bristol’s “not another one” horror at early elections is not shared by the government, which is happiest on a war footing), the tactical question Kyle highlights is how broadly Labour should embrace a “progressive alliance” with the Lib Dems in England. Cautiously, would be my advice. Starmer has chosen well so far in terms of keeping out of marshy deal territory with the SNP over the prospect of another referendum in Scotland, not least because that opens a lot of questions that swing English voters would get exercised about. Also, the route to breaking up the union is not promising for Labour. Added to which, a volatile electorate is one to handle with care in trying to steer progressive choices at the ballot box. Standing down in unwinnable seats can have the opposite effect, leaving voters feeling “pre-owned” and surly. (It is also not much fun for candidates running a Potemkin race when resources are being syphoned elsewhere shadow cabinet booster visits are diverted.) So yes to being smart about cooperation when it comes to allocating resources in marginal seats, but the question for tacticians will be how widely this recipe can be applied. Perhaps another reason Conservatives, while rattled at Johnson’s errors, still find it hard to get too worried about Starmer is that he sits at times uneasily between the Blairite legacy and something vaguely to the left of Blair, while eschewing the excesses and economic irrationalities of Corbynism. This is a narrow path to tread and for mere humans outside the sectarian culture of Labour membership such gradations are more puzzling than enlightening. If Starmer is (rightly) channelling competence and pragmatism as core virtues, it muddies the waters when he defines his views on private sector involvement in the NHS by citing his dying mother making him promise his father would not “go private”. I have no doubt this story is true and deeply felt, but that does not make it a shrewd one to deploy. Emotional stories are strong meat in politics, because they are seen to channel the strongest drives of politicians. It sounded either like a signal of a coming clampdown on private healthcare or a bit of a Dickensian throwback. In truth, large swaths of the NHS are already a public-private mix. The intention was vague and that is always dangerous for an opposition leader seeing to acquire a clearer profile. I doubt that Starmer would, for instance, intervene in the operations of outfits such as Totally Healthcare, which delivers out-of-hospital services (physio, podiatry and the like) and provides logistics to reduce waiting times to NHS trusts with no obvious downside. The popularity of out-of-hours GP services via apps or online services such as Babylon suggests a lot of the public are less than zealous about public-private demarcations. One way or the other, health and social care need core improvements in funding and efficiencies and a re-moralised and better trained and managed workforce. Better to start with the pressing issues than embark on a phoney war. More broadly, Britain’s place in the world should be fertile territory for the opposition. Bluntly, Starmer has a negligible profile abroad. (I am frequently reminded to explain who he is when being interviewed on British politics in Germany.) But centre-left revivals in the US and Germany are also an opportunity to return Labour to the global conversation. The revival of a declined centre-left party after years in the wilderness is encouragement for Starmer, given that Olaf Scholz too started out as a lawyer representing trade unions and has also adopted the “respect” theme to win over voters in depressed heartlands. He has shown that a quiet style, self-discipline and weaving coalitions of interest along with canny strategising can pay dividends. Whether dealing with the Ukraine crisis, the handling of Poland’s challenge to EU pluralist norms or how far to ally with the US under an increasingly inward-looking presidency without Britain’s Nato weight being taken for granted, Labour needs to sound like it can return to the top table of defence and security with public trust – hence the upbeat message to the armed forces and upbeat take on post-Brexit possibilities. The weakest areas for the Starmerism recipe are what it means for industrial strategy, beyond outbidding a likely pouring of Tory largesse into left-behind areas, and the quest for an economic and business strategy that can plausibly claim to cut through a muddle of post-Covid, post-Brexit schemes and sound like a solid prospect for a country that is bruised, but seeking resilience. To Starmer’s credit, he took on the job in awful circumstances and is now clear of the risks of leadership challenge. Labour’s prospects for power are still a work in progress, but are no longer a pipe dream. And if the Tories do not yet fear Starmer, they have started to notice he is around. In the long haul of opposition, that’s a small leap forwards.

1/2/2022,"As Joe Root has discovered, an Ashes tour to Australia can unspool as precipitously as a ball of wool bounding down a fire escape. Five England teams have won since Bodyline: Andrew Strauss’s sprinkler squad in 2010-11, Mike Gatting’s 1986-87 “can’t bat, can’t bowl, can’t field” crew, Mike Brearley’s 1978-79 outfit who beat a Packer-weakened Australia, Len Hutton’s 1954-55 side spearheaded by Frank Tyson and the team led by Ray Illingworth, who regained the Ashes in 1970-71. Illingworth, who died on Christmas Eve at the age of 89, was one of England’s shrewdest leaders, tactically brilliant and able to coax brilliance from tricky customers such as Geoff Boycott and John Snow.  Ian Chappell, who watched him at work during that series and took over the Australian captaincy in the crucial seventh Test, considers him the best England captain he played against. “I learned a lot from his captaincy,” he says. “Mostly by observation. He handled Snow better than anyone else and, not that Dennis [Lillee] was John Snow, seeing Ray work with John helped me with Dennis. “There is a lot of bullshit talked about giving players pep talks and so on, but I could see Ray and John had an understanding. When it really mattered, and the battle was elevated, John would perform. “I learned you always had to keep attacking and even when you knew you had to pull back a bit, you still had to let the batsman know you were on him. Ray always had someone in an attacking position and you’d think, what’s going on, I’m doing all right here? That’s not easy to do as captain.” England did not travel without baggage. Illingworth was knocking on the door of 40 and his squad’s average age was 30, dubbed Dad’s Army and the worst side to land on Australian shores before the plane touched down. The side was beset by injuries and there was a divide between the sharp-eyed Illingworth and the tour manager, David Clark, a former Kent amateur captain, a farmer and a supporter of Colin Cowdrey, who had been passed over for the captaincy after injury and never really came to terms with his demotion. Ken Shuttleworth was on his first tour. The Lancashire fast bowler took five for 47 on Test debut at Brisbane and played in the second Test before tearing an adductor in his thigh during an up-country game in Wagga Wagga. He remembers the tension well. “We had a problem with the manager, Ray was at loggerheads with him all the time. It was a split tour really, between north and south. I think Ray was quoted at the time that he thought Clark was more on Australia’s side than ours. “However, it was a happy touring party. People got on with each other, everyone performed and everyone pulled together, Ray had the respect of everyone. He had a tremendous cricket brain and he always backed his players – whatever he said went.” Shuttleworth roomed with Snow, who was outstanding, finishing with 31 wickets – more than double that of the leading Australian, John Gleeson. “We talked a lot together, he played a lot of Neil Diamond all the time on a little tape recorder – it drove me daft. He had his differences with the manager and it was always John who finished the team meeting off with an awkward question.” It was an exhausting tour for England, with long months away from home – Shuttleworth can still remember the fatigue that came with bowling eight-ball overs in the 100F heat of Perth – and they did not win an lbw decision in the series. They played four-day state games as well as travelling out to the sticks on promotional duties. England pulled ahead with victory in the fourth Test after a series of draws, only to find the organisers had tacked a seventh Test on to the end of the tour to make up for the abandoned Test in Melbourne (which gave way to the first one-day international). This gave Australia a chance to pull even in the contest, as well as the promise of a full match fee, while England’s players were instructed to do it for love. Illingworth was not happy and sent away Clark away “with a flea in his ear” while eventually squeezing a £25 fee per player out of the MCC assistant secretary, Donald Carr. The Test was marred when Terry Jenner ducked into a bouncer from Snow and Illingworth took his players from the field after a section of the crowd started chucking bottles. On the last morning Australia needed another 100 to win with five wickets in hand and Greg Chappell and Rod Marsh at the crease, but they collapsed, giving England a 62-run victory. Illingworth was carried from the field by his delighted team. Chappell remembers a typical Yorkshireman who did not waste words, but whose company he enjoyed over a few beers. “The best way to describe him is as an honest cricketer. He made you fight for his wicket, usually at No 8, and you especially felt that when there was a match on the line. “He wasn’t an outstanding bowler but you always knew you were in a battle. He had a lot of pride in his own and his team’s performances – one of the things that is most galling about the current England team is that you wonder how much pride there is. There was a lot of fire in Ray’s side – that is what I came to think of as Test cricket.”",Sport/Sport,‘The respect of everyone’: how Ray Illingworth won the Ashes,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/02/the-respect-of-everyone-how-ray-illingworth-won-the-ashes
1/2/2022,"The harsh midday sun beats down on the withering pawpaw plants in Maureen Adhiambo’s patch of land. The villagers in Kamenya have not seen rain for months, and when it does come, the soil is too dry and loose to retain any of the moisture or nutrients. Last year Adhiambo saw her maize dry up long before it could mature. Like many farmers in the Homa Bay region, on the south bank of Kenya’s Lake Victoria, she is staring at yet another cycle of crop failure.  “Farming has been frustrating for us,” says Adhiambo, in the shade of a thirsty-looking banana plant. “Look at my neighbours’ farms. They too will harvest very little, if any. Changing weather patterns and poor soils have made it difficult to make a decent living out of farming.” To support her family, the mother of three had moved to the neighbouring county of Migori in 2016 for a job selling life insurance. But that did not fare well and she went home a year later to take another shot at farming. She planted beans, onions and other vegetables in the hope that the rains due from March to May would arrive on time, but they did not. She tried again in October but the short rainy season failed too. She also lost her 13,000 Kenyan shillings (£84) investment. Frustrated, she decided to try her hand at poultry keeping. About 10km from Adhiambo’s home, in Seka village, 35-year-old Dominic Owuor tends a healthy crop of kale while on a nearby piece of land, tomato plants are thriving. His seven acres, leased from his neighbours, contrast sharply with Adhiambo’s. Here, the soils have a heavier water and nutrient retention ratio, thanks to water that Owuor pumps from Lake Victoria. However, he hasn’t had an easy time switching from paid employment to farming either. After graduating, Owuor took up teaching but he left in 2013 to work in the financial sector before going into full-time farming in 2018. “I tried my hand at farming while still employed, hoping to contribute to food security and provide employment to young people. But I knew little about agribusiness and the kind of plants that can withstand deteriorating weather patterns. I also employed casual labourers who weren’t well versed in farming either. Out of my initial investment of 100,000 Kenyan shillings, I barely managed half of that in returns,” he says. Farming around Lake Victoria is a hit and miss affair. They have seen the impact of a changing climate as the lake’s water level has risen and swallowed hundreds of acres of land. For those on higher ground, prolonged droughts have killed off young crops. The erratic climate and poor knowledge of viable agricultural practices have devastated food security and economic prospects for people who relied on fishing. According to the World Bank Group climate change action plan 2016-2020, the world will need to produce 50% more food by 2050 but estimates that with current practices, there will be a 40% water shortfall between demand and available supply. “Climate-smart land use, applied across the agricultural, forestry, fisheries, and conservation sectors, can increase food production and farmers’ income while offering large opportunities for climate resilience,” says its report. Adapting to the vagaries of an adverse climate is a steep learning curve for small-scale farmers. Adhiambo and Owuor benefited from training offered by UK organisation Practical Action, which assists smallholders to make a living while protecting their environment. Since Owuor switched from maize crops to horticulture, his revenues have grown to 250,000 shillings a month. “Even after deducting labour, farm inputs and marketing costs, I am happy with what I get. Irrigation-fed horticulture puts money in your pocket all year round unlike food crops that depend on an uncertain weather pattern,” he says. Adhiambo took up poultry farming with 17 chicks. Two years ago, she and her husband attended Practical Action-sponsored training to learn about poultry disease management, vaccination and housing. They also learned how to feed red worms with organic waste that are a rich source of protein for the birds. “I knew nothing about poultry when I started but since the training I have multiplied the birds and increased my earnings. I’m also taking eggs to the hatchery for more stock. Poultry works better for me than crop farming,” says Adhiambo. Jim Ouko, the youth and livelihood adviser at Practical Action, says changing rain patterns, high irrigation costs, new pests and diseases have all lowered food production while flash floods have destroyed crops and displaced farmers. “Prolonged droughts or severe flooding contribute to high costs of available food items. Farmers need to adopt climate-resilient farming practices … while cultivating pest-resistant African leafy vegetables.” Like Adhiambo, Merceline Akinyi, a mother of two from Nyakach, Kisumu, also got frustrated after losing maize crops. She learned how to rotate her crops to keep pests at bay and now her land is divided into paddocks where she grows vegetables using water from shallow wells within her compound. “I decided I will no longer wait for the rains,” says Akinyi. “Before 2010, I used to plant food crops and get nothing due to poor rains. I remember spending 7,000 shillings to prepare and plant in my one-acre farm and getting not more than 5,000 shillings in return, a financial loss and reduced food security. With water nearby, I can grow vegetables all year round. People in my area are not food-secure and come to my home to learn about modern ways of farming,” she says. The training has also attracted young people who previously had no interest in growing food. At a farm next to Owuor’s, 29-year-old Dedan Odhiambo is sorting out freshly-picked tomatoes. He is also a teacher who took up farming after failing to find a job. “I learned farming under Owuor’s wings,” he says. “He encouraged me to lease an acre of land and helped me identify a hybrid tomato variety that is bacteria and wilt-resistant. You can see the results.” As the Food and Agriculture Organization warns that 690 million people are facing hunger, the farmers of Lake Victoria are working to buck the trend with climate-smart agriculture – one acre at a time.",News/Society,Food for the future: helping farmers in Kenya adapt to the climate crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/02/food-for-the-future-helping-farmers-in-kenya-adapt-to-the-climate-crisis
1/2/2022,"‘For me, history is the record not only of how things change, but how people make things change, how they act individually and collectively to create a better world.” So wrote American historian Tyler Stovall about his approach to his craft. The echoes of historians such as EP Thompson and Eric Foner, Barbara Fields and Robin DG Kelley are unmistakable in his work. Primarily a historian of France, Stovall’s work bears on many important present-day themes – the relationship between race and class, the tension between universalism and particularism, the contradictions of liberalism. Yet few people outside academia know of him and his death last month was almost unmarked in the mainstream media, a testament, perhaps, to the parochialism of our culture. Engaging with his work is a useful means of illuminating many contemporary debates.  Stovall’s early research in the 1980s looked at the making of working-class communities, especially in the “red belt” around Paris. Increasingly, though, his attention became drawn to some of the blind spots of French historiography, notably issues of race and imperialism. His studies of French colonialism and of colonial labour in France helped to challenge the idea of a colour-blind nation, not mired by the racism that beset the Anglo-Saxon world, and to unpick the ways in which the traditions of French universalism could be wielded to deny rights and dignity to those deemed not to belong. Stovell’s final book, White Freedom, published last year, was in some ways the culmination of his life’s endeavour. Yet it is also as frustrating as it is enlightening, revealing both the significance of his work and also the confusions that infest contemporary thinking about race. Modern ideas of freedom and liberty, Stovall observes, emerged alongside theories of race. While liberty and racism are usually seen as opposing claims, they are, in fact, he insists, inextricably linked, because ideals of freedom and liberty assumed the exclusion of non-whites. As such, they bear “the unmistakable stamp of whiteness and white racial ideology”. Unquestionably, many thinkers who helped to shape modern ideas of freedom and liberty held racist views and supported exclusionary practices. John Locke, often regarded as the founding philosopher of liberalism, defended slavery and owned shares in a slave-trading company. Immanuel Kant, the towering Enlightenment figure, believed that “humanity is at its greatest perfection in the race of whites”. The French revolutionaries who proclaimed the Declaration of the Rights of Man denied those same rights to slaves until forced to do so by an insurrection in the colony of Saint Domingue. Abraham Lincoln launched the civil war that ended slavery in America but insisted also that he was not “in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races”. For all this, Stovall’s own work shows that the struggle over the meaning of freedom was more complex than can be captured by a notion such as “white freedom”. The demand that certain groups be excluded from the benefits of freedom was provoked primarily not by racial concerns, but by political needs, especially by fears of social disorder. Throughout the 19th century, Stovall points out, France was torn between “the radical vision of democracy championed by… the sans-culottes of the French Revolution” and the liberal desire to “not endanger private property”. This struggle sparked the revolutions of 1830 and 1848 and the 1871 Paris Commune. The crushing of these revolutionary challenges led to the institutionalisation of more restricted notions of freedom. The tension Stovall describes here goes back to the 17th century and forward to the 20th. In the famous Putney debates during the English civil war, Oliver Cromwell’s son-in-law Henry Ireton spoke for the officer class in insisting that “Liberty cannot be provided for in a general sense if property be preserved”. A century later, this question was at the heart of the struggle between the radicals and the moderates of the Enlightenment. In the 19th century, the liberal imperialist Thomas Macaulay argued, in response to Chartist demands for democracy, that “universal suffrage… is incompatible with property” and hence “with civilisation”. The notion of race provided a means of casting inequalities as natural and inevitable. This became the justification for enslavement, for the brutal treatment of colonial subjects and for the denial of rights to non-white peoples in Europe and America. It was also the justification for suppressing working-class rights. In the 19th century, as Stovall acknowledges, the working class was viewed as a distinct and inferior race. The French Christian socialist Philippe Buchez wondered how “within a population such as ours, races may form, so miserable, inferior and bastardised that they may be classed as below the most inferior savage races, for their inferiority is sometimes beyond cure?” He was talking not of Africans or Asians but of the working class and the rural poor of France. Racial divisions became also a means of dismantling challenges to the ruling order by persuading white workers that their interests lay in their “whiteness”, not in their status as workers. In the American south, for instance, “Jim Crow” laws, which imposed apartheid-style segregation, were mainly enforced at the turn of the 20th century in response to the “Fusion” movements, which brought together black workers and poor white farmers, to challenge the established order and, in North Carolina, win power. The Democrats, the ousted ruling party, launched a violent “white supremacy campaign” to rupture the coalition, win white working-class support for treating blacks as outcasts and regain political control. This complex relationship between liberties, race, class and whiteness is ill-served by a concept such as “white freedom”. Nor is this just an issue about history. “Whiteness” has become an idea fetishised today both by racists and by many anti-racists, the one claiming that all white people have a common set of interests, the other reframing racism as “white privilege”. In doing so, both, in different ways, obscure the political and structural reasons for racism, on the one hand, and the social problems facing the working class, on the other, making it more difficult to challenge either. Tyler Stovall’s work is important in illuminating previously ignored areas of class, race and colonialism and should be better known and cherished. It should also be challenged and questioned, especially the arguments about “white freedom”. Intellectual legacies, like freedoms, are always contested.
