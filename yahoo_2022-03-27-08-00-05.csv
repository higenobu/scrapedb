3/27/2022,"The Duke of Cambridge has acknowledged that he may not succeed the Queen and the Prince of Wales as head of the Commonwealth, as he vowed not to be ""telling people what to do"". Reflecting on his eight-day Caribbean tour, the Duke spoke candidly about how it had ""brought into even sharper focus"" questions about the past and the future. It followed a last-minute change to a speech in which he acknowledged that relationships with Commonwealth countries would “evolve”, as he sought to change the narrative of a tour that has been criticised for being out of touch and rooted in the past. As they boarded a flight home, the Duke said: “Catherine and I are committed to service. For us, that's not telling people what to do. It is about serving and supporting them in whatever way they think best, by using the platform we are lucky to have. “It is why tours such as this reaffirm our desire to serve the people of the Commonwealth and to listen to communities around the world. Who the Commonwealth chooses to lead its family in the future isn't what is on my mind. “What matters to us is the potential the Commonwealth family has to create a better future for the people who form it, and our commitment to serve and support as best we can.” In 2018, Commonwealth leaders decided that the Prince of Wales should succeed the Queen in the honorary, non-hereditary position. There have been suggestions that it might be rotated among Commonwealth leaders. It followed a slew of protests about slavery, demands for reparations and a personal apology from the Royals Elements of the tour have also generated imagery that has been widely criticised for its “colonial” overtones. In Jamaica, Andrew Holness, the country’s prime minister, made clear that the country was ready to “move on” and would sever ties with the British monarchy as soon as possible. Meanwhile, in Belize on Thursday, the government announced a new commission that will be holding consultations on the “decolonisation process enveloping the Caribbean region”. The Duke acknowledged that foreign tours offered “an opportunity to reflect”, noting that they had learnt a lot from prime ministers to school children about their fears and hopes for the future. “I know that this tour has brought into even sharper focus questions about the past and the future,” he said. “In Belize, Jamaica and The Bahamas, that future is for the people to decide upon. But we have thoroughly enjoyed spending time with communities in all three countries, understanding more about the issues that matter most to them.” On Friday night, the Duke gave a speech at a black tie dinner in Nassau in which he addressed, for the first time, the issue that had overshadowed much of the tour. His comments marked the first time that feverish debate about the moves towards republicanism had been recognised. The Duke is understood to have been keen to address the highly contentious issue at some point during the tour of Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas, having “wrestled” with it for months beforehand. A source close to him said he had thought about it a great deal and was well aware that as a future king, it was a subject that would be on the agenda for years to come. He is very keen to “have his own voice” and to express his opinions in his own words, the source added. The late addition to the speech was included following a series of high level briefings on Friday, as the Duke and his Kensington Palace team discussed how best to respond to the fallout. The Duke said: “Next year, I know you are all looking forward to celebrating 50 years of independence – your Golden Anniversary. “And with Jamaica celebrating 60 years of independence this year, and Belize celebrating 40 years of independence last year, I want to say this: we support with pride and respect your decisions about your future. “Relationships evolve. Friendship endures.”",World/The Telegraph,Prince William suggests he may not succeed the Queen and his father as head of the Commonwealth,https://news.yahoo.com/prince-william-suggests-may-not-204620924.html
3/27/2022,"BANGKOK (AP) — Ukraine's stiff resistance to the Russian invasion, which has turned Moscow's advance into a grinding war of attrition, has underscored the importance to American allies of the need to be prepared for any eventuality, the top U.S. Army commander in the Pacific said Friday. Gen. Charles Flynn told The Associated Press that the events in Europe highlight the need for regular training exercises with partners, like the one that just concluded between the Royal Thai Army and the U.S. Army. “The will of the Ukrainian army, the will of their government, the will of the resistance is a contributing factor to what's unfolded,” said Flynn, who was in Thailand for the end of the exercise and for talks with military commanders as part of a trip meeting counterparts throughout the region. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine just over a month ago, many quickly drew comparisons to the situation between Taiwan and China, which claims the self-ruled island as its own territory. China has stepped up its military harassment of Taiwan in recent years and has not ruled out the use of force against it, though China's President Xi Jinping has stressed that “peaceful reunification” is in the best interests of both sides. Analysts say the situation between Taiwan and China does not fit a simple narrative and that imminent military action from China is unlikely. But Taiwan's Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng said this week he was considering extending the current four-month compulsory military service amid growing concerns about tensions with China, which have been underscored by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Last week, U.S. Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth suggested that American allies in the Indo-Pacific would be following the events in Ukraine closely to see what lessons can be applied in their own planning. “One of the really key things that’s happening right now if you’re Japan or Taiwan or South Korea is looking at the difference in the will to fight, and the fact that the Ukrainians are fighting,” she said on a panel hosted by the Hudson Institute think tank. “And frankly, the Ukrainians have done a lot of work since 2014, in particular, to increase their proficiency. And I think, you know, that’s something that I would imagine that the Taiwanese are looking at carefully,” she added. In recent years, the U.S. and NATO allies have been pre-positioning modern and well-maintained equipment in eastern European member nations to reassure those worried of Russian aggression. The strategy also makes it easier to move soldiers rapidly to the region, rather than having to move tanks, artillery and other heavy equipment into the theater — and has already paid dividends in the wake of the invasion of Ukraine, Wormuth said. Planners are now looking at how to expand that approach in the Indo-Pacific as well, she said. “We’ve got to let the diplomacy, the defense diplomacy, move forward, but I think we’d be very interested in finding more opportunities to have greater (pre-positioned equipment) in the theater,” she said. Already, the U.S. is conducting exercises using the pre-positioned equipment it has in warehouses and on ships in the Indo-Pacific region, like in this month's exercises in the Philippines, Flynn said. The active use of it in training helps streamline the process of getting the equipment to the soldiers and also ensures the equipment is fully functional in case it is needed quickly. “The more we practice that, the better that we will be at doing it at a speed and volume that, in the event there is a crisis, we're able to access that material, move it rapidly, be able to get it in the hands of soldiers and formations so that they can go address whatever problems it's being issued for,” he said. In its long-awaited Indo-Pacific strategy released last month, the White House emphasized that it sees the region as “vital to our security and prosperity” and singled out growing challenges from China, which it said “is combining its economic, diplomatic, military and technological might ” to try and expand its influence. “Our objective is not to change the PRC (People’s Republic of China) but to shape the strategic environment in which it operates,” the paper said, adding that the U.S. was “determined to strengthen our long-term position"" in the region. Flynn said thus far, the increased U.S. commitment to Europe in the wake of Russia's attack on Ukraine has not meant that resources have been directed away from the Indo-Pacific. “No one's asked the U.S. Army in the Pacific for anything substantial to Europe,” he said. “We have plenty of work here and ... we're more than capable of doing it.”",World/Associated Press,US general: Ukraine resistance highlights need to prepare,https://news.yahoo.com/us-general-ukraine-resistance-highlights-131414862.html
