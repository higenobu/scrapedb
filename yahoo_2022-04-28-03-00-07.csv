4/28/2022,"ALENA MAZURENKO - WEDNESDAY, 27 APRIL 2022, 17:39 Commander of the 36th Separate Marine Brigade of the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Sergei Volynsky (Volina), in a new video message, requests an ""extraction"" procedure for the defenders of Mariupol, following the example of the operation in Dunkirk in 1940. Source: Volynsky's Facebook page Quote: ""For 62 days we have been conducting combat operations in complete encirclement, we are currently located at the Azovstal plant and are carrying out tasks together with the units of the Azov Regiment and other units that are surrounded ... There are more than 600 wounded guys of varying conditions in our group, they really need medical help, there are horrendous conditions, no treatments, no personnel who could help them. Also, civilians are injured, and we are providing assistance to them as much as we can. With us are hundreds of civilians, dozens of children, many people with disabilities, the elderly. The situation is difficult, there are problems with water."" Details: Volynsky reiterated that he was appealing to world leaders and diplomats so that the defenders of Mariupol would be heard and so that they would apply an ""extraction"" procedure, following the example of Operation Dynamo (Dunkirk operation, Dunkirk evacuation) during World War II. This is when, in 1940, the military of Britain and France were surrounded by German troops and blockaded in the area of &#8203;&#8203;the city of Dunkirk. The troops that had amassed on the coast were threatened with disaster, but Hitler ordered the offensive be stopped and ""not to approach Dunkirk closer than 10 km"". Winston Churchill, in a famous speech in 1940, called the events at Dunkirk a ""miracle"". More than 300,000 French and British soldiers were evacuated during the rescue operation. Quote: ""Today my main message is: save the ""Mariupol"" garrison. Apply the ""extraction"" procedure to us. It's not 1940, it's 2022. People will simply die here. The wounded will die, and the living will die in battle, civilians are dying here with us in bunkers, private houses and high-rise buildings, where they are simply being shot."" Volynsky added that the defenders of Mariupol hope for help. Background : Earlier, Ukrainian intelligence reported that it had information that the Russian authorities were planning to send units of the National Guard and the FSB to storm the positions of Ukrainian defenders at Azovstal. Ukrainian fighters reported that during the night of 26 April, 35 airstrikes were carried out against Azovstal, civilians were injured and they are under rubble At a meeting with Putin, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said that the invaders had taken control of Mariupol, and then added that Azovstal was controlled by Ukrainian defenders. Putin said on camera that there was no need to storm the plant, but after that the shelling of Azovstal only intensified. President Volodymyr Zelensky argues that the Ukrainian forces still lack the funds to carry out a military operation to remove the blockade on Mariupol. On 23 April, the Azov Regiment posted the first part of a video from the cellars of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol, which was blockaded by the enemy, showing children hiding from Russian bombs. On 24 April, the ""Azovists"" released a new video from the Azovstal bunkers and tunnels. On it, women hiding with children in a shelter said that they had only a few days left of water and food supplies.",World/Ukrayinska Pravda,Following the example of Dunkirk: the fighters of Mariupol ask for a procedure that even Hitler agreed to in 1940,https://news.yahoo.com/following-example-dunkirk-fighters-mariupol-143900745.html
4/28/2022,"The Club for Growth, long seen as one of the most powerful groups in Republican politics, is sticking with its pick in Ohio’s messy GOP Senate primary despite attacks from top Trump allies backing a rival candidate. The anti-tax organization, which is supporting former state treasurer Josh Mandel in the contest, has begun airing a new ad taking direct aim at former President Trump’s endorsement of venture capitalist J.D. Vance. Trump backed Vance, the author of “Hillbilly Elegy,” despite Vance’s previous criticism of Trump. In the new ad, actors portraying Ohio voters are shown old footage of Vance knocking Trump. In one clip, Vance is shown declaring himself “a Never Trump guy” — a label used by Republicans who refused to support Trump in 2016 and 2020. In another clip, Vance suggests that he might vote for Hillary Clinton, Trump’s Democratic opponent in 2016. “Has Trump seen this?” asks one actor in the ad after viewing the footage, later saying of Vance, “Where does he get off saying that?” Another actor says, “We’ve got our own eyes and our own ears.” The ad also includes a reference to Trump’s support of Mitt Romney, with an actress disdainfully noting, “How’d that turn out?” Romney, now a Republican senator from Utah, has since emerged as a leading Trump critic within the GOP and voted twice for Trump's impeachment. “Look, I love Trump, but he’s getting it wrong with J.D. Vance, too,” says another actor. It is not the first Club for Growth ad highlighting Vance’s past statements. Late last year, Trump reportedly asked the group to stop airing the ads — which included Vance calling Trump “idiot,” “noxious” and “offensive” — worrying that they would hurt Trump’s popularity in the state. The Club for Growth spent $71 million supporting Republican candidates in the 2020 election and has so far raised $38 million for the 2022 midterms, spending $13 million. For his part, Vance has become a stalwart Trump supporter in recent years and is a regular guest on Tucker Carlson’s primetime Fox News program. According to the New York Times, Trump expected the Club’s media campaign to stop once he endorsed Vance, but when the attacks continued, Trump had an assistant send the group’s president, David McIntosh, an angry and expletive-laden text message. In response, a spokesperson for the group told Politico that the group was buying more ad time in support of Mandel. The president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., has since attacked both Mandel and the Club for Growth numerous times on Twitter. Although the Club for Growth opposed Trump in the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, it quickly fell in line behind him once he won the presidency and supported his reelection effort in 2020. Trump and the Club are backing many of the same candidates in Republican primaries this year, a fact that McIntosh attempted to emphasize to the New York Times. “I very much view this as one race where we’re not aligned, we’re on opposite sides, which doesn’t happen very often,” he told the newspaper. Trump’s endorsement appears to be paying off in the crowded Ohio primary, which includes a number of other candidates in addition to Vance and Mandel. A Fox News poll released Tuesday showed Vance taking the lead in the race, with 23 percent support compared to Mandel’s 18 percent. The primary will be held May 3. The winner is expected to race likely Democratic nominee Rep. Tim Ryan in November’s general election. Trump won Ohio in both 2016 and 2020 by eight points. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report currently predicts that the Republican nominee will have the edge in the general election. Trump’s April 15 endorsement of Vance roiled many Republicans in Ohio who are supporting other candidates in the race to replace retiring GOP Sen. Rob Portman. The former president held a rally with Vance on Saturday night where he explained the endorsement. “He’s a guy that said some bad s*** about me,” Trump said of Vance. “If I went by that standard, I don’t think I would have ever endorsed anybody in the country.”",Politics/Yahoo News,Top conservative group fires back at Trump as Ohio Senate primary escalates into GOP civil war,https://news.yahoo.com/top-conservative-group-fires-back-at-trump-as-ohio-senate-primary-escalates-into-gop-civil-war-164829590.html
