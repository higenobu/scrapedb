4/8/2022,"It was not the perfect evening for Leicester but it would be foolish to be too downbeat on an European night when PSV held firm. Brendan Rodgers will be encouraged by his side’s vibrant display but they failed to find a priceless winner. For supporters, this was a lively contest that served to further whet the appetite for their second-leg meeting in Eindhoven next week, when one of these sides will secure a semi-final berth in the inaugural Europa Conference League semi-finals. This was Leicester’s first European quarter-final since exiting the Champions League against Atlético Madrid under Craig Shakespeare five years ago and while it would not be their competition of choice Rodgers had stressed that his side are in no position to turn their noses up at the prospect of a trophy. The reality is this tournament is Leicester’s best route into playing in Europe next season, as well as their last avenue to record any silverware this campaign. Nevertheless, they almost got off to a disastrous start with two minutes played but Mario Götze, played onside by an unknowing Ricardo Pereira, was thwarted by Kasper Schmeichel’s right hand after spying a delicious reverse pass by Joey Veerman. It was a game played at a frenetic pace, with crisp passes and neat triangles seemingly the dish of the day, but both sides were guilty of lacking poise in front of goal. Kelechi Iheanacho had Rodgers cursing, the striker leading the line in the absence of Jamie Vardy squandering a wonderful chance after seizing on a mistake by Andre Ramalho. Iheanacho brushed off the defender but scooped wide of Yvon Mvogo, a surprise starter in the PSV goal. Rodgers required a gulp of water. Harvey Barnes went even closer to opening the scoring in a lively first half, rattling the upright a minute before half-time with a thunderous shot. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall again excelled in midfield and found joy drifting wide on to the left flank. But Dewsbury-Hall’s teasing ball across the six-yard box went unmet and when Iheanacho latched on to another fine cross, the striker was penalised for a foul on the PSV centre-back Olivier Boscagli. The England Under-21 winger Noni Madueke, a player being tracked by Leicester, saw a shot deflected wide and the PSV forward’s pace caused problems for the hosts and, early in the first half, he left four blue shirts lagging behind his trail. Jonny Evans made an important intervention in defence but Leicester had the better chances. Timothy Castagne saw a shot blocked inside the box after Ibrahim Sangaré’s poor clearance dropped kindly but Mvogo was quieter than Rodgers would have liked. For PSV, backed by a vociferous pocket of supporters, also plenty of positives. Things were delicately balanced, the occasion seemingly ready to be determined by one false move and seven minutes into the second half Pereira appeared fortunate there was no video assistant referee to take a second look at his brush with the PSV captain Cody Gakpo. The PSV forward cut inside and Pereira made contact in the box but the appeals were turned away by the referee Ivan Kruzliak. Wesley Fofana was imperious in defence, superbly raking the ball from Eran Zahavi but there were frustrations for Rodgers, who turned on the touchline and winced when Marc Albrighton’s aimless pass upfield was easily gobbled up by a PSV defender. Iheanacho dropped another shot wide from distance but he was soon replaced by Ademola Lookman. Leicester have now lost one of their past 13 matches here and, apart from Götze’s early chance, Schmeichel was rarely troubled. Another Madueke surge, this time from halfway, put Leicester on the back foot but the attack fizzled out and Castagne would have been pleased to see the former Tottenham youngster withdrawn with nine minutes to play. Rodgers introduced Patson Daka at the same time, in place of Albrighton, whose nutmeg on Philipp Max drew gasps from a sold-out home crowd. But an entertaining game was bereft of the all-important finishing touch.",Sport/Football,Barnes and Iheanacho fail to take chances as Leicester are held by PSV,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/07/leicester-psv-eindhoven-europa-conference-league-quarter-final-first-leg-match-report
