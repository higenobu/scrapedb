3/1/2022,"The Ukrainian border guards initially presumed to have been killed in action on Snake Island, a small, Black Sea outpost off the Ukrainian coast are now believed to have been captured by Russian forces. An exchange between the Ukrainians stationed there and an encroaching Russian warship in the early hours of the war had provided Russia with a geographic victory and Ukraine with a morale boost. “I am a Russian warship, I ask you to lay down your arms and surrender to avoid bloodshed and unnecessary deaths. Otherwise, you will be bombed,” said the Russians over the radio. “Russian warship, go f*** yourself,” replied the Ukrainians after a short conversation amongst themselves. It was originally believed that the plucky Ukrainians had then been fired upon and killed, but the Ukrainian Navy has since confirmed that they were captured instead. “We are very happy to learn that our brothers are alive and well,” it declared in a statement. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky, who stated last August that “this island, like the rest of our territory, is Ukrainian land, and we will defend it with all our might,” had said that the guards would be awarded the country’s highest military honor. The incident provided and early example of the fog of war and its effects, as reporting on the conflict is clouded by distance, efforts to capitalize on potential PR victories, and the general confusion over the multiplicity of events occurring at any one time.

3/1/2022,"SOFIA (Reuters) -Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov on Monday fired Defence Minister Stefan Yanev for his reluctance to describe the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a war, reiterating that Sofia would speak in one voice with the European Union. Petkov said his centrist coalition government would ask parliament on Tuesday to approve Yanev's dismissal and appoint Todor Tagarev, who was a caretaker defence minister in 2013, to the post. ""My defence minister cannot use the word operation instead of the word war. You cannot call it an operation when thousands of soldiers from the one and the other side are already killed,"" Petkov said in a televised statement. ""The Bulgarian interest is not in bending our heads down...When we see something we do not agree with, something so obvious, we cannot keep quiet,"" Petkov said. Bulgaria is a member of the EU and NATO but many in the Balkan country - which was the closest Communist satellite of the Soviet Union during the Cold War era - feel a strong cultural and historical affinity with Russia. Some fear that taking a very strong stance against the Russian invasion could hurt Bulgaria, which is reliant on Russian energy supplies and tourist inflows to its Black Sea summer resorts. President Rumen Radev said the change of defence ministers in the midst of a military crisis not far away was risky and the ruling coalition would be responsible. Bulgaria has pledged to bolster NATO's eastern flank and lead a battle group in cooperation with NATO, but comprised mainly of Bulgarian troops. Analysts say Yanev's replacement may spur the deployment of more troops of NATO allies in Bulgaria. ""Bulgaria will not transform into an anti-Russian hawk in NATO, but will follow the tone set by Petkov for a clearer voicing of the Bulgarian position in NATO against the aggression in Ukraine,"" political commentator Ivo Indzhov said. In a Facebook post late on Sunday Yanev wrote that he was the subject of a targeted attack aimed at replacing him with someone who would be more open to taking decisions that serve foreign interests, which could put Bulgaria's security at risk. Petkov slammed Yanev's statement saying neither of his ministers had the right to ""their own foreign policy, especially on Facebook"". Petkov said Bulgaria was not forced to take any decisions by its Western allies but stressed that the biggest guarantee for the country's security lay in standing united with its EU peers. Separately, the foreign ministry said on Monday Bulgaria had evacuated the staff of its consular mission in the Ukrainian Black Sea city of Odessa.

3/1/2022,"Vladimir Putin is ""unhinged"" and the West should be wary of a leader who has his finger on the nuclear button, a former US intelligence chief has warned. Ukraine is locked in a fifth day of fighting after Moscow launched a full-scale invasion - though the Russian military has so far failed to make the inroads it believed it would. Delegates from both Ukraine and Russia are meeting on Monday on the Belarus border for peace talks. Former US director of national intelligence James Clapper said the move could be a ""positive sign"", but was cautious in trusting what Russia says. He told CNN: ""This could be a sincere effort on the part of the Russians to negotiate or it could be going through the form of things and encouraging the Ukrainians to lay down their arms and give up. ""We just have to see how this pans out. I personally am not one to trust what the Russian says so we will have to see, but I do think it's a positive sign.""

Watch: Russia's Putin puts nuclear forces on high alert On Sunday, Putin announced he was putting Russia’s strategic nuclear deterrent on high alert in response to what he said was ""unfriendly"" steps from the West. The Russian leader said he was putting Moscow’s nuclear forces on a “special regime of combat duty” in response to “aggressive statements” coming from Western powers. Clapper warned this was a concerning development after previous rhetoric Putin has spouted in recent days. ""This is something that concerns me on the heels of his previous warning,"" he said. ""I'll quote: 'Whoever tried to interfere should know that Russia's response will be immediate and will lead to such consequences that you have never experienced in history'.""

""Here is a guy who really has his finger on a nuclear button. To me it bears close watching"". Former deputy director of national intelligence Beth Sanner was more reserved in her evaluation of events, saying Putin was doing this ""out of weakness"", and added: ""It's scary but he doesn't have much else."" Sanner added: ""We have said as an intelligence community all along that Putin really wants to avoid a nuclear war with the United States because obviously that would be bad."" Dr Thomas Wilkins, senior lecturer in international security from the University of Sydney's Department of Government and International Relations, says both Russia and the US have a ""constant readiness"" when it came to their nuclear assets. ""The question is if he is putting more forces on alert, which is a clear escalation,"" he told Yahoo News Australia. ""I'm inclined to believe it's for theatrical effect to ""deter"" further ""hostile"" moves by Western allies. ""Putin may have gambled with the invasion of Ukraine, but it's unthinkable that Moscow would want this to end in a nuclear exchange."" He said the subjugation of Ukraine ""could never be worth a nuclear conflict to Russia"". Curtin University political analyst Professor Joe Siracusa said the announcement was an indication of how quickly Russia can escalate their attack. ""Just to prove the point how dangerous he is – he’s put his nuclear weapons on alert,"" he told Sky News Australia. “What that means is – they’re on a 15 minute alert. [Russia] only needs 15 minutes to get these things going in the direction [Putin] wants them to go.” Additional reporting by Tom Flanagan",News/Yahoo News UK,"Putin is unhinged and has his finger on the nuclear button, warns ex-US intelligence chief",https://news.yahoo.com/putin-is-unhinged-and-could-have-finger-on-nuclear-button-says-ex-us-intelligence-chief-134457816.html
3/1/2022,"STORY: This is what life looks like for sick children, mothers and babies in Kyiv's Ohmadyt Children's Hospital. They are adjusting to life under siege in the underground bunker. Some lying in corridors on IV drips, others finding comfort in makeshift beds and blankets laid out on either side of the concrete isle. Maryna's nine-year-old child is undergoing cancer treatment in the basement. “We receive all the medicine we need, though we are running out of food. Local charity funds promised to bring some. We are waiting for them to come and bring us bread, essentials and some juice for children.” This hospital is the biggest of its kind in the country. It normally has up to 600 patients. But that number is around 200 now, according to chief surgeon Volodymyr Zhovnir. Those who are staying are simply too sick to go home or flee the capital. Pavlo Plavskyy is the neurosurgeon in the hospital: “We have a lot of patients that we can’t move to another hospital, it is very hard. Some patients – we moved them to western Ukraine. A lot of patients don’t want (to be moved) because it is the biggest hospital and they are treated here, they don’t know what is the situation in another hospital. That’s why they don’t want to move sometimes. They found here a place and my department don’t want to move them upstairs at all because moving upstairs and downstairs is always very hard for babies and parents.” Kyiv is girding for worse battles to come as Russian forces approach in what Moscow calls a ""special operation"". So far the hospital has been spared the bombardment that has reached the outskirts of the city. Although staff said they have heard gunfire in recent days. The entrance to the hospital was guarded by heavily armed police during a media visit. Zhovnir said the focus is on the security of medical staff who are desperately needed to treat the patients. And he is just as worried about the children who were not able to make it to the hospital as those who are stuck there.",Health/Reuters Videos,"Mothers, babies shelter in Kyiv hospital basement",https://news.yahoo.com/mothers-babies-shelter-kyiv-hospital-161215345.html
3/1/2022,"Russian forces entered Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, before dawn on Sunday, engaging in urban combat and blowing up a gas pipeline in the city. While Ukrainian fighters were able to stave off a Russian tank assault in Kharkiv on Thursday and Friday, Russian reconnaissance troops in Tigr-M armored vehicles entered the city’s northern neighborhoods before dawn on Sunday, Ukrainian officials said, according to the Wall Street Journal. The city’s governor, Oleh Synehubov, said that Ukrainian forces were engaging in urban combat and asked residents to remain in shelters while Ukrainian armed forces are “liquidating the enemy.” Elsewhere, Russian forces attacked airfields and fuel facilities while Ukrainian forces held on to the capital, Kyiv. A pair of explosions were heard just before 1 a.m. local time — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said one blast happened near the Zhuliany airport while the mayor of Vasylkiv said the second happened at an oil depot 25 miles south of the capital, according to the Associated Press. Meanwhile, Ukrainian authorities ordered residents in the country’s capital to remain indoors until Monday morning as officials search for Russian infiltrators who clashed with Ukrainian troops and civilian volunteers in shootouts overnight. Residents spent another night in bomb shelters and basements as explosions hit the city. The Ukrainian military said it had intercepted a ballistic missile fired at Kyiv from Belarus, according to the Wall Street Journal. One of Russia’s airstrikes hit Okhmatdyt, a children’s hospital in central Kyiv, leaving one child dead and others injured. Russian armor reportedly continued to make its way from Belarus toward the Chernobyl nuclear-disaster exclusion zone, as the Russian military continues its path toward Kyiv. The United Nations said there have been at least 240 civilian casualties, including at least 64 deaths, as a result of the invasion that began Thursday, the AP reported. However, the UN warned the toll could be “considerably higher.” Ukrainian officials said the country’s show of resistance had taken the Russians by surprise, complicating Russian President Vladimir Putin’s plans to quickly overthrow the country’s leadership. “These three days have forever changed our country and the world,” Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said Sunday morning. “These will be trying times ahead. But now we are no longer the only ones to believe in our victory. And that is why we are receiving the aid that was unthinkable three days ago.” On Saturday, the United States and its European allies said they would remove “selected” Russian banks from the international SWIFT payment system in an escalation of economic sanctions against Moscow in response to the invasion. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday that the U.S. would offer up to $350 million in additional military aid to Ukraine. The aid includes “lethal defensive assistance” to help Kyiv combat Russian armored and airborne forces.

3/1/2022,"By Yew Lun Tian BEIJING (Reuters) -China is willing to work with the United States on a G7-led global infrastructure plan and welcomes Washington to join its Belt and Road Initiative, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday. The Group of Seven (G7) richest democracies, consisting of United States and its allies, proposed the Build Back Better World (B3W) initiative in June to help developing countries meet infrastructure needs, as they sought to counter China's growing influence. ""We are also willing to consider coordinating with the U.S. 'Build Back Better World' initiative to provide the world with more high-quality public goods,"" Wang said in a video message at an event for the 50th anniversary of the Shanghai Communique, which marked the normalising of relations between United States and China. He said China is also open to the United States participating in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the Global Development Initiative, a call by Chinese President Xi Jinping in September for all countries to work towards sustainable development. G7's B3W initiative is seen as an alternative to rival China's BRI, which was launched by Xi in 2013. More than 100 countries have signed agreements with China to cooperate in BRI projects like railways, ports, highways and other infrastructure. Wang urged Washington to work with China in Asia-Pacific to build a ""family of openness, inclusiveness, innovation, growth, connectivity and win-win cooperation"", rather than turn the region into one of conflict and confrontation. The Shanghai Communique, a document which marked the end of isolation between both countries and issued during then U.S. President Richard Nixon's historic visit to China, meant that two major powers with different social systems were willing to coexist peacefully, he said. Wang reiterated a call for the United States to stop supporting independence for Taiwan, a self-ruled island China claims as its own.
