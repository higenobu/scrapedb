2/9/2022,"A 28-year-old Carlstadt man was found at University Hospital in Newark 12 days after he went missing, according to the city's Police Department. James Dugan told his family he was going to meet a woman in Newark on Jan. 27 and never returned, police said more than a week after his disappearance. Catherine Adams, a spokesperson for the department, said officers from Newark and Carlstadt had checked area hospitals, including University Hospital, to no avail after Dugan was reported missing on Feb. 1. But on Tuesday, the Newark Police Department was advised that Dugan had been a patient at University Hospital since Jan. 28, one day after his disappearance. As authorities searched for Dugan, his sister pleaded for the public's help in multiple Facebook posts under the name Sarah Elizabeth, and said he was last seen at the Riviera Hotel in Newark.

2/9/2022,"KYIV—The Yangulbaev brothers could do nothing but watch in horror as thousands of people took to the streets of their hometown, shouting that the two men were “Western agents” and “The shame of the nation.” The pro-government mob stormed the public square of the Chechen capital city of Grozny and burned photographs of the siblings and their family who had earned the ire of notorious Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov and his most ardent supporters. It was a surreal moment for the exiled lawyers, 27-year-old Ibrahim and 29-year-old Abubakar, who had watched videos of the protests on Feb. 2 from a safe place in Europe. The brothers told The Daily Beast they had no intention of triggering a “blood feud” with Kadyrov. But after years of Abubakar documenting state-ordered torture cases in Chechnya, and Ibrahim raising alarms about the leader’s alleged corruption on social media, Kadyrov had essentially declared the two enemies of the state, threatening them “prison or burial” and encouraging public demonstrations against the family. One Chechen lawmaker went so far as to say he’d like to “rip [their] heads off.” Russian Dissident Snatched Hours After Daily Beast Interview About His Entire Family Being Kidnapped “It was the most absurd moment in my life: Chechen television showed crowds ‘protesting’ against my family,” Abubakar, who formerly worked with The Committee Against Torture, told The Daily Beast. Before escaping the country late last year, both claim to have endured bouts of imprisonment and torture at the hands of the state. And just last month, their mother, Zarema Musayeva, was arrested on dubious charges of fraud, prompting their father to flee the country as well. “Kadryov and his police have already kept me in basements, hung me, poured cold water over me, tortured me with electricity. Now they are keeping my sick mother as their hostage in Chechnya,” Ibrahim said. Ibrahim told The Daily Beast on Sunday that he thinks his family was initially targeted because of comments he made about Kadyrov on his Telegram channel. “I listed cases of impunity. I simply could not understand how [Kadyrov], a former separatist guerilla, could be swimming in gold, enjoying corruption, while treating Chechens, as slaves. We are not terrorists, we are Kadyrov critics,” he said. On the same day of the massive protest against the family, Russian president Vladimir Putin reportedly met with Kadyrov. “Putin summoned Kadyrov to the Kremlin as a result of these outrageous attacks on our family. But we have not heard a single of Putin’s statements in support of the attacks,” Abubakar told The Daily Beast. As for their next steps, the attorney added: “We are going to fight Kadyrov now: I am a civilized lawyer, so I am going to use only civilized methods. We are not going to call for violence but appeal to Russian prosecutors and the Investigative Committee, after Kadyrov has called for murdering us all.” Several of Moscow’s biggest media outlets and opposition politicians have spoken out in support of the Yangulbaev family. A decorated reporter from the independent Novaya Gazeta newspaper, Yelena Milashina, had to flee Russia herself, after Kadyrov called her a “terrorist” over her coverage of the ordeal. Moscow local deputy Ilya Yashin launched a petition calling for Kadyrov to be ousted on Monday. “Kadyrov constantly talks of ‘real men’ and dignity, but it is obvious for every Russian man that this is ultimately unmanly to kidnap a sick mother of your opponents. And this is criminal behavior to call for a blood feud, for ripping people’s heads off… I have been calling for the Kremlin to dismiss Kadyrov since 2016.” More than 50,000 people signed Yashin’s petition within just a few hours on Monday. In it, Yashin writes that during the 15 years of Kadyrov’s rule, Chechnya has become a state within the state, playing by “its own rules, while Russian laws do not work there.” The Chechen leader has gone “completely out of the Kremlin’s control,” according to Yashin. “We know that only one man can control Kadyrov: that is Putin. Everybody around Putin, including FSB generals, are surely outraged now to see how Kadyrov’s plans to cut heads off, so Putin has met with Kadyrov to calm things down,” Yashin told The Daily Beast. “But Kadyrov took it for a great achievement: he now brags about Putin receiving him on the highest level and giving him support; even if Putin did not give his support, that was how Kadyrov interpreted it. So we demand Putin to dismiss Kadyrov.” Gay-Bashing ‘Putin’s Soldier’ Was Allowed to Take Young Polygamous Brides The Daily Beast interviewed Abubakar back in December, shortly after police detained dozens of his relatives in Chechnya. “Kadyrov is mad at us because many people both in Chechnya and in Russia support us, and not him,” Abubakar had told The Daily Beast after Kadyrov promised that his family members will now “shake” every time they hear a knock at the door. “Sure, there were assassinations by Kadyrov squads in Russia, in Europe, and in Turkey but he has never called for impunity so openly. All of his fury is now channeled at my poor mother, who he keeps in jail. She has diabetes but we are not even sure she receives insulin to stay alive.” People hold placards with photographs of Yangulbaev family members and a message reading “Disgrace to the Nation” during a protest in central Grozny. Most independent Chechen experts believe that Kadyrov has a complete card blanche to control the country the way he pleases, as long as the republic remains stable and loyal to Moscow. “For years, Chechen authorities relied on collective punishment to suppress dissent. The vicious attack on the Yangulbaev family is apparently meant as a signal to all critics and opponents of Kadyrov, and particularly those in Chechen diaspora,” Tanya Lokshina, associate director for Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division, told The Daily Beast on Monday. Despite the horror their families have been through, the brothers say that the entire ordeal has inspired more citizens to speak out against Kadyrov than ever before. “So far all Kadyrov has achieved by arresting our mother is that the number of [his Telegram channel’s] followers has increased from 16,000 to more than 36,000 people and most of them share our views. That is a huge opposition,” Ibrahim told The Daily Beast. Still, he concedes, “We are not safe, [not] as long as Kadyrov and all his closest men are off the international terrorist list.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

2/9/2022,"Let’s play a game. When did the following headlines run? “Documents Improperly Taken from White House to Archives.” “National Archives had to retrieve White House records” from private property. If you didn’t know any better, you might think they were from the 2016 presidential campaign. Remember when, in October 2016, House Republicans launched a series of hearings attacking the then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton over her emails? Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, who now serves as the lead Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, fumed that “Hillary Clinton gets treated different than anybody else.” Another member of the panel stated, “This is the reason for this hearing – the sloppiness, the messiness, and the ability for a secretary of State to do something that shouldn’t have been done.” Another Republican weighed in, “I want to know about the destruction – the hammering of BlackBerrys.” The panel’s chairman at the time, Jason Chaffetz, who can now be seen espousing self-righteous nonsense of Fox News, attacked Clinton, “The secretary had a choice. She chose to not abide by the rules of the State Department.” And yet, here we are, in 2022 and we have: The New York Times: “Trump Gives Documents Improperly Taken from White House to Archives.” The Washington Post: “National Archives had to retrieve Trump White House records from Mar-a-Lago.” And just for good measure, we have this gem from 2018 via Politico, “Meet the guys who tape Trump’s papers back together,” and this piece from The Times in 2019: “Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump Use Private Accounts for Official Business, Their Lawyer Says.” That’s right, from the same forces that brought you the chorus of “Hillary’s emails” and the smash hit “Lock Her Up” comes a new spin on an old song, “Do As I Say, Not As I Do.” As reported by The Post, “The National Archives and Records Administration last month retrieved 15 boxes of documents and other items from former president Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence because the material should have been turned over to the agency when he left the White House, Archives officials said Monday. … The Archives has struggled to cope with a president who flouted document retention requirements and frequently ripped up official documents, leaving hundreds of pages taped back together – or some that arrived at the Archives still in pieces.” Alexander Vindman: Why I’m seeking accountability from Trump allies in court The Times reporting added, “More recently, in response to the House select committee investigation into the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol, Mr. Trump’s former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, provided hundreds of pages of documents, some of which came from his personal cellphone. The committee said it had questions about why Mr. Meadows had used a personal cellphone, a Signal account and two personal Gmail accounts to conduct official business, and whether he had properly turned over all records from those accounts to the National Archives.” Given these bombshell revelations, coupled with their concern for federal government record-keeping compliance, you would think Republicans would be foaming at the mouth, chanting “Lock Him Up” and calling for an immediate series of hearings and subpoenas to be issued to anyone who was a part of the Trump White House. And yet, nothing. Crickets. Silence. Jim Jordan isn’t grand-standing on Fox News calling Donald Trump incompetent or a liar or “absolutely wrong.” House Republicans aren’t clamoring for an FBI or Department of Justice investigation into the destruction of official records and use of personal devices. The very Republicans who led the charge for investigations into Clinton’s emails don’t have a damn thing to say about what Trump and other senior administration officials did in apparent violation of the Presidential Records Act (PRA). The ball now falls into the court of congressional Democrats, specifically, those at the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, which has jurisdiction over the PRA. They may be inclined to just sit this one out and allow for the work of the Jan. 6 committee to unfold. But it is worth noting that at one point in time, Republicans in Congress had half a dozen committees investigating Clinton. They flooded the zone and held a tsunami of hearings over the course of five years. All of which was designed to injure the political fortunes of the Democratic front-runner for president. The future of Texas: It might be red now, but the Lone Star State is turning blue right before our eyes During the Obama years, Republicans were fond of beginning their oversight hearings by reciting a mission statement: “Our solemn responsibility is to hold government accountable to taxpayers, because taxpayers have a right to know what they get from their government. We will work tirelessly, in partnership with citizen-watchdogs, to deliver the facts to the American people and bring genuine reform to the federal bureaucracy.” I for one think it’s time Democrats used Republicans' own words against them and went to work.
