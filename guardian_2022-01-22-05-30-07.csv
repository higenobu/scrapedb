1/22/2022,"John Boyega gives an honest, intuitive and sensitive performance in this fervent if slightly by-the-numbers hostage drama – and it is one of Michael K Williams’s final appearances on film, playing the negotiator.  First-time feature director Abi Damaris Corbin has co-written the screenplay with the British dramatist Kwame Kwei-Armah, inspired by the real case of a depressed US Marine Corps veteran who in 2017 calmly walked into a bank in Atlanta, Georgia, and threatened to detonate the bomb he claimed was in his backpack unless he was paid the $892 he was owed in disability benefits – money that had been suddenly discontinued for opaque bureaucratic reasons, plunging him into poverty.Boyega plays Brian Easley, a guy who served honourably in the military but like so many in his position has found the transition to civilian life a trial – he has become estranged from his wife and infant daughter, alienated from his wider family, vulnerably housed and without stable employment, depressed and suffering from delusions. When he walks into the bank, his polite, almost diffident manner with the terrified bank clerks may be an indicator of his fundamental decency – or a symptom of his insanity. Selenis Leyva and Nicole Beharie play the bank employees, Olivia Washington is Brian’s anguished wife and Williams is the negotiator – a former military man himself who understands how callous America can be to the guys like him and Brian.892 is interesting on the implied, unspoken endgame of hostage situations like this – the way negotiators will appear to take the demands seriously to keep the criminal talking, while at some level everyone knows how it is going to play out. And Boyega conveys the fact that it is now not just about – or not at all about – the money which he knows he is not going to get. It is about being heard. Then there is the weird, Stockholm-syndrome solidarity developing between Brian and the bank staff, based partly on their growing appreciation of his troubled humanity and also their (understandable) suspicion that they will be collateral damage if armed police storm the bank.There is also the question of racism. Brian asks one bank clerk if they have ever been robbed before and what happened to the robber. “Arrested” she replies, from which Brian grimly concludes that this man must have been white – a terrible omen.892 is a well-crafted film but there are, perhaps inevitably, hints of Zucker-Abrahams cliche in the caring TV news journalist (Connie Britton) who talks to Brian on the phone and the negotiator (Williams) whose integrity is at odds with his cynical bosses who might want to solve the situation with a sniper’s bullet instead of reaching out to Brian and talking him down.Basically, nothing much evolves or changes in the film’s various personae as it plays out, almost in real time: the brief flashbacks to Brian’s military service and to his later bureaucratic ordeals in the VA office are all telling us what we pretty well knew already.Boyega’s performance has an essential sympathy and dignity that are vital to this drama; an unshowy sense of self-worth that keeps it together. 892 is showing at the Sundance film festival with a release date yet to be announced",Arts/Film,892 review – John Boyega holds together by-the-book hostage drama,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/21/892-review-john-boyega-holds-together-by-the-book-hostage-drama
1/22/2022,"The death of four members of an Indian family at the US-Canada border has once again highlighted the dangerous journeys families are willing to risk for a better life – and the groups that profit from their desperation. Police in Canada announced on Thursday that the victims, who included a baby and young boy, probably froze to death while attempting to cross into the United States during a blizzard. Seven others survived and were intercepted by police.  “It was an absolutely mind-blowing story. It’s so tragic to see a family die like that, victims of human traffickers … and of people who took advantage of their desire to build a better life,” Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau told reporters on Friday. “This is why we are doing all we can to discourage people from crossing the border in an irregular or illicit manner. We know there are great risks in doing so.” India’s high commissioner to Canada, Ajay Bisaria, described the deaths as a “grave tragedy”, and announced that a consular team was travelling to Manitoba to aid in the investigation. India’s ambassador to the United States said staff from the Chicago consulate were also heading to Minnesota. US officials announced the arrest of Steve Shand, who faces charges of human smuggling. Shand, 47, is due to appear in court on 24 January. “The investigation into the death of the four individuals in Canada is ongoing along with an investigation into a larger human smuggling operation of which Shand is suspected of being a part,” said John Stanley, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations, in court documents. On Wednesday, investigators from the US Department of Homeland Security acted on a tip from a snowplow driver, who spotted Shand’s van stuck in a ditch during the blizzard, according to court documents. The driver helped Shand free the vehicle, and Shand said he was bound for Winnipeg to visit relatives. Authorities say it was the second time he had been in the area. When the officers stopped the car, near the border crossing at Pembina, North Dakota, they found two Indian nationals with Shand and later intercepted a group of five. All spoke Gujarati, a language from the western region of the country. One told officials he spent a large amount of money to come to Canada under a fake student visa and planned to visit an uncle in Chicago. In preparation for their journey, the group were wearing brand-new winter clothing, including parkas, boots and gloves. They, along with Shand, had black balaclavas. Officers also found evidence to suggest a baby was travelling with the group, but when they couldn’t find the child, they notified Canadian police. While the prairie landscape the group traversed is largely flat, the sprawling grain fields are deceptively dangerous in the winter. Cold winds whip relentlessly and blowing snow dramatically reduces visibility. Deep snow drifts make movement slow and tedious. All these difficulties are compounded in the dark, when the family is believed to have made their crossing attempt. Court documents in the United States also provided a glimpse into the brutal cold the survivors endured. One woman stopped breathing while she was transported by border officials, and required the partial amputation of her hand due to frostbite. Another was also treated for frostbite. “Smugglers only care about the money they are going to make and have zero regard for lives lost,” Anthony Good, a sector chief border patrol agent in Grand Forks, said in a statement. The deaths have rattled the community of Emerson, a rural farming town of less than 700 people. “You just try to figure out why there would be that kind of desperation to cross the border in such terrible weather conditions. Crossing the border in the best of times, you know, is dangerous,” Dave Carlson, a local official for the Emerson-Franklin municipality in Manitoba told a local radio station. The region has been the site of numerous crossings in recent years – although most were coming from the United States into Canada after the election of former president Donald Trump. In December 2016, two men lost their fingers to severe frostbite after struggling through waist-deep snow during a blizzard as they crossed into Manitoba. A few months later, a woman died of hypothermia near the border on the American side. Three years ago, a pregnant woman was rescued near the border after she became trapped in a snowbank and went into labor. The tragic deaths this week serve as a reminder of the risks families are willing to take, Rema Jamous Imseis, the Canadian representative for UNHCR, said in a statement. “Whatever the circumstances, no one should ever have to choose such a perilous journey.”",News/Law,Family’s death at US-Canada border underscores desperate journeys of migrants,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/21/familys-death-at-us-canada-border-desperate-journeys
1/22/2022,"One of Britain’s most wanted fugitives has been arrested by Spanish police just 24 hours after an appeal to track him down was launched. Joshua Hendry, 30, was arrested in the town of San Pedro de Alcántara in Marbella, southern Spain, on Thursday after police spotted him out walking a dog.  Hendry has an international arrest warrant against him for his extradition to the UK on charges of drug trafficking and belonging to a criminal gang in Liverpool. He was named as one of 12 most wanted British criminal suspects thought to be hiding in Spain in an appeal by the National Crime Agency (NCA) and the charity Crimestoppers, in partnership with the Spanish police, on Wednesday. Hendry’s arrest came just 24 hours after photographs of the wanted men were published, with others sought in connection with crimes including murder, drug trafficking and arms smuggling. The NCA’s director general of operations, Steve Rodhouse, who attended the launch of the appeal alongside the Spanish security minister, Rafael Pérez Ruiz, said that Spain was not a “safe haven” for criminals. “The last thing the fugitives’ associates will want is the combined determination and capabilities of the UK and Spanish law enforcement focusing on them,” he said. According to Rodhouse, many of the wanted men on the list are likely to have attempted to blend in with British communities in Spain. He added: “Loyalties change over time and we urge anyone with information about these men to help us find them.” Pérez Ruiz said: “The campaign allows us to reinforce and strengthen police collaboration between Spain and the United Kingdom with the aim of creating a hostile environment which impedes criminal organisations from setting up in Spain and criminals from settling in our cities.”",News/UK news,British fugitive arrested in Spain 24 hours after appeal launched,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/21/british-fugitive-arrested-in-spain-24-hours-after-appeal-launched
1/22/2022,"Tottenham have stepped up their pursuit of Adama Traoré and are increasingly confident of signing the Wolves player. Fresh talks were held on Friday and Spurs are preparing a new bid for the 25-year-old, who is high on Antonio Conte’s wishlist. Wolves have accepted that Traoré will not extend his contract beyond the end of next season and although Bruno Lage would like to keep the Spain international until the summer, the club are ready to sell at the right price.  Tottenham had an opening £15m bid rejected, which they expected, and discussions aimed at a breakthrough have taken place. Conte wants Traoré as an option at right wing-back or right wing and emphasised on Friday that he hoped Spurs would act on his transfer requests. “I made evaluations about the squad but I have spoken with the club and I hope the club will listen to me,” the manager said. Lage accepted Traoré’s future was out of his hands. “The club talk with him and he talks with them and they will decide the future,” the manager said. “I’m happy with him, it’s the only thing I can say. He’s focused, he’s ready.” Tottenham confirmed that Hugo Lloris had signed a new contract to 2024 and remain in talks with Paris Saint-Germain over a sending the midfielder Tanguy Ndombele on loan.",Sport/Football,Tottenham growing confident of signing Adama Traoré from Wolves,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/21/tottenham-growing-confident-of-signing-adama-traore-from-wolves
