2/6/2022,"The late Roger Ailes spoke of being ""constantly"" interrupted by former President Trump during talks, per a new book. In the book, Times reporter Jeremy W. Peters writes about the relationship between the two men. Ailes expressed his feelings about Trump to former Fox News chief legal analyst Andrew Napolitano. The late Fox News chairman Roger Ailes sometime in 2016 told the network's then-chief legal analyst Andrew Napolitano he wasn't thrilled when he had to speak to former President Donald Trump, who was then a candidate for office, according to a new book. ""I hate it when he calls me. He talks to me like I talk to you. He cuts me off. He doesn't let me finish my sentences. He constantly interrupts me,"" Ailes told Napolitano, according to the upcoming book, written by the New York Times political reporter Jeremy W. Peters. When Roger Ailes was the chairman of Fox News, he led the network to dizzying heights in the world of cable news, cultivating voices like political commentator Glenn Beck and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin for conservative audiences across the country. However, there was one figure who was key to the rise of Ailes, even dating back to his old days at CNBC — Trump. The former president has been a staple of the media and television world for years, from 1980s-era interviews on CNN's ""The Larry King Show"" to his successful stint on NBC's ""The Apprentice,"" but it was at Fox News where Trump's increased visibility gave rise to his future 2016 presidential campaign. In 2011, Ailes bet big on Trump, giving him a weekly time slot on the network and telling staffers that the businessman was a ""relatable rich"" figure who would prove to be attractive to viewers, according to the adaptation of an upcoming book. While Trump was able to deliver his own form of star power for the network, supporters of the bombastic businessman were also helping reshape American political discourse in the ensuing years, as Peters detailed in ""Insurgency: How Republicans Lost Their Party and Got Everything They Ever Wanted,"" which will be released February 8. In the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election — which Trump entered as a first-time political candidate before quickly dominating the Republican field — he brought viewers to the network. Ailes — who was ousted from the network in May 2016 after facing multiple accusations of sexual harassment before he died in May 2017 — was cognizant of the political figure that he had helped create, according to the book. Despite the role that Fox News played in Trump's journey to the White House, the former president remains frustrated by the network's decision to call Arizona for now-President Joe Biden on Election night in 2020. Trump even exalted in a ratings dip that the network experienced last year. ""They're doing poorly now, which is nice to watch,"" he told Peters in an interview last summer. The former president then pivoted back to his relationship with the late network executive. ""Roger wasn't the easiest guy to deal with,"" he said. ""But he was great at what he did. And he built a behemoth."" He then emphasized: ""And that behemoth can evaporate very quickly if they're not careful.""

2/6/2022,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — A former Florida tax collector whose arrest led to a federal probe into U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz wants a judge to delay his sentencing scheduled for next month for yet another time as he continues to cooperate with federal prosecutors. Joel Greenberg's attorney on Friday asked a federal judge in Orlando, Florida, to allow him to file a motion seeking a delay in the sentencing hearing currently scheduled for March 29. U.S. District Judge Gregory Presnell previously granted two delays. In court papers, Greenberg's attorney said his client had been cooperating with federal prosecutors in Orlando and Washington in active investigations. Attorney Fritz Scheller said he intended to file a motion outlining the reasons for the extension but that it contained “sensitive"" information about the investigations, as well as Greenberg's cooperation. Because of the confidential nature of that information, that request and any subsequent hearing should be sealed and kept out of the public eye, Scheller said in the court papers. The judge later on Friday granted the request to seal the motion asking for a delay. Greenberg is facing up to 12 years in prison after pleading guilty last May to six federal crimes, including sex trafficking of a child, identity theft, stalking, wire fraud and conspiracy to bribe a public official. Greenberg’s plea agreement with prosecutors requires continued cooperation with an ongoing probe into sex trafficking. His cooperation could play a role in an ongoing investigation into Gaetz, a Republican friend of his who represents much of the Florida Panhandle. Gaetz was accused of paying a 17-year-old girl for sex. He has denied the allegations and previously said they were part of an extortion plot.",U.S./Associated Press,Gaetz friend asks for sentencing delay as he works with feds,https://news.yahoo.com/gaetz-friend-asks-sentencing-delay-203338468.html
2/6/2022,"Newly released video from the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack shows a Texas man ranting about a “stolen” presidential election and calling for elected officials to be publicly killed. “Cut their head off!” he yells at one point. Its release by the Justice Department came just hours after top Republican Party officials issued a resolution on Friday stating that the people who mobbed the Capitol had engaged in “legitimate political discourse.” The man in the video, Ryan Nichols, was arrested in the days after the attack and pleaded guilty to all of the charges against him, which include assault with a crowbar and pepper spray. His case is still pending in federal court. Nichols filmed himself talking about Vice President Mike Pence, whom President Donald Trump told his supporters had the power to overturn the result of a presidential election during the official certification process ― an idea that is false. At his “Stop the Steal” rally held directly before the attack on the Capitol, Trump had expressed his hope that Pence would do his bidding and intervene. Pence did not. “I’m hearing reports that Pence caved,” Nichols says in the video. “I’m telling you, if Pence caved, we’re gonna drag motherfuckers through the streets.” “You fucking politicians are gonna get fucking drug through the streets! Because we’re not going to have our fucking shit stolen,” he says to cheers from the Trump supporters around him. “I’m telling you right now, Ryan Nichols said it: If you voted for fucking treason, we’re gonna drag your fucking ass through the street,” he exclaims, later adding: “So let us find out, let the patriots find out you fucking treasoned this country!” Nichols was charged alongside a friend, Alex Harkrider. Court documents show how the men posted about their involvement in the riot to Facebook. At one point outside the Capitol, Nichols allegedly shouted a call to arms into a bullhorn: “If you have a weapon, you need to get your weapon!” His trial is set to begin in July.
