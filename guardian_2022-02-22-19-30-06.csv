2/22/2022,"Promoting rugby union should be the simplest of games in weeks like this. The Six Nations is in full flow, Wales are due at Twickenham and the passion and intensity is self evident. Who could possibly need persuading to watch on television or, having taken out the required mortgage, to buy a ticket? The answer is millions of people. There is no shortage of non-believers and latterly the big Cs – Covid and concussion – have not helped either. Adult male participation rates have fallen and rugby is not a priority in many inner-city schools. Which makes this a timely moment to ponder how best to woo the unconverted. Are social media clips, celebrities and gaming platforms really the route to a lifelong affiliation? What, ultimately, is rugby’s USP? And what makes it so addictive for those who do love it?  The local library is a decent place to start. Some outstanding literary minds, from Arthur Conan Doyle to PG Wodehouse, have long since attempted to project rugby to a wider audience. So did James Joyce in The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man: “The evening air was pale and chilly and after every charge and thud of the footballers the greasy leather orb flew like a heavy bird through the grey light.” Joyce recognised the light and shade and two-pronged physical and mental challenge rugby offers. And also how the power of the imagination can be the strongest of all. Could it be that rugby’s superpower, over and above its off-field conviviality, is its subtle emotional resonance, not the creation of shiny new (or expanded) competitions that may or may not hit the mark? A modern-day guru is clearly required at this point, someone instantly capable of articulating and untangling such intangibles. Step forward the perceptive Richard Beard, author of the most sharply observed rugby book to be published this century. It is almost 20 years since Muddied Oafs first appeared but it remains a classic of its sparsely populated genre. The late, great Frank Keating described it at the time as “the book rugby has been waiting for”. These days Beard is a widely acclaimed novelist and nonfiction writer. His most recent book, Sad Little Men, is a brilliant study of the emotional carnage a boarding school education can inflict and should probably be on the national curriculum. In his time he has also played club rugby in England, Scotland, France, Switzerland and Japan and remains hugely grateful for the perspective and sense of belonging the game has given him. So what does he think? A few lazy stereotypes, he reckons, need nailing instantly. “There’s a limited imagination about rugby sometimes,” he says, well aware of perceptions that a Twickenham matchday is basically “the professional classes having a jolly” and that rugby fans are there for the drinking, the blazers or possibly both. “A lot of people also have an experience of university rugby clubs, which doesn’t always leave a great impression. But that’s not really what the game is all about any more and hasn’t been for some time.” Instead, beyond the muscular crunch and visceral physicality, Beard believes the game should be trying harder to highlight its myriad possibilities. “Rugby’s boxing but with friends. That’s the great joy of it in a way. But it’s not just about boxing, it’s about finding space. “It’s hard to explain to someone who’s never experienced it. Imagine having a line of large people in front of you, all of whom want to knock you to the floor. Then you somehow find a way through without anyone laying a hand on you and space miraculously opens up. It’s a moment of utter transcendence and joy I’ve never found in another sport. It’s terrifying because everyone is now trying to catch you up but that moment when the whole field opens up is just fantastic.” Which is not to say the “elemental aspect” is not, for many, the biggest draw. As Beard says: “The basic collision of very committed individuals – both in men’s and women’s rugby – is still a great spectacle. You don’t have to understand all the rules to enjoy that.” But in his experience it can also be more emotionally complex than that. “People like sports which somehow map on to their idea of how the world works. Life can be very strategic, quite slow and about getting as close to your objective as possible. A bit like bowls. But if you’re a person who sees life as a struggle and quite combative with some moments of enlightenment then rugby is the game for you.” Even Joyce, who instinctively empathised more with the shivering schoolkid stuck reluctantly out on the wing, clearly sensed a sport with a rare depth to it. As Beard wryly observes: “Apparently Finnegans Wake is full of references to Irish rugby but no one’s ever read it.” Samuel Beckett, a scrum-half in his youth, was another enthusiast. If he was unable to obtain a ticket to watch France v Ireland in Paris he would instead head out on to the street and listen for the roar of the crowd before retreating inside to follow the radio commentary. Just another mundane sport? Hardly. Fast-forward almost a century and the importance of the Six Nations remaining embedded in the national psyche can not be emphasised enough. “The Six Nations is part of the ritual of the British year,” says Beard. “If it ever goes off terrestrial TV that would die off really quickly. It would be a huge shame.” So, whether you are eight or 80, settle down on the sofa at tea-time on Saturday shortly before England and Wales run out. And then, just as Joyce and Beckett did, let your imagination roam free.  This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

2/22/2022,"Uefa is ready to drop St Petersburg as the venue for this year’s Champions League final as the military crisis in Ukraine deepens. The final of Europe’s most prestigious club competition is due to be played in Russia’s second-largest city on 28 May but Uefa finds itself under increasing pressure to move the venue after Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, announced a decision to send troops into Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region.  Uefa’s current position remains that the match will be played in St Petersburg but it is understood that the situation is fluid, with officials considering contingency plans. The Champions League final has been moved, because of Covid, in both of the past two seasons. “Uefa is constantly and closely monitoring the situation,” the governing body said in a statement. “At present, there are no plans to change the venue.” Although Russian clubs are not a significant player on the pitch, with only Zenit St Petersburg remaining in European competition this season, the country’s financial clout is significant. Gazprom, the Russian gas company, is at the heart of European football and has longstanding commercial arrangements with Uefa. Last summer it announced an expansion of its sponsorship arrangement with Uefa to include the European Championship as well as the Champions and Europa Leagues. It also holds the naming rights for the stadium at which the final is due to be played, the Gazprom Arena. On Tuesday the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, called for the immediate shutdown of the Nordstream 2 gas pipeline project as a response to Russia’s military actions.

2/22/2022,"It might be best known today for its otters and puffins but 170m years ago the Isle of Skye was home to an enormous flying reptile with a wingspan bigger than a kingsize bed, researchers have revealed. Fossil hunters in Scotland say they have recovered the remains of the world’s largest Jurassic pterosaur, adding the creature – known informally as a pterodactyl – also boasted a mouthful of sharp teeth for spearing and trapping fish.  With a wingspan of about 2.5m or larger – around the size of the largest flying birds today, such as the wandering albatross – the creature sheds new light on the evolution of pterosaurs, given they were not thought to have reached such a size until about 25m years later. “When this thing was living about 170m years ago, it was the largest animal that had ever flown, at least that we know of,” said Prof Steve Brusatte, a co-author of the research from the University of Edinburgh. “We’ve really dragged back in time the evolution of large pterosaurs,” he said. Brusatte added previous finds suggested pterosaurs did not grow much larger than about 1.6-1.8m in wingspan during the Jurassic, only reaching much larger sizes during the Cretaceous period. “There were pterosaurs living at the end of the Cretaceous when the asteroid hit that were the size of fighter jets,” said Brusatte, referring to the mass extinction 66m years ago that wiped out non-avian dinosaurs, pterosaurs and myriad other creatures. The latest discovery calls into question the idea competition with birds may have initially driven the boom in pterosaur size. “Birds evolved from dinosaurs around the time when this [pterosaur] was living,” said Brusatte, although he added birds may have exerted evolutionary pressures for them to grow larger still. It is not the first time pterosaurs have been unearthed in the UK – the fossil hunter Mary Anning unearthed what was dubbed her “flying dragon” in 1828. Brusatte said the new discovery, dubbed Dearc sgiathanach meaning both ‘winged reptile’ and ‘reptile from Skye’ in Scottish Gaelic, is notable for the completeness of the fossil. “It’s probably about 70% complete, which is really just outstanding for a pterosaur, because these things are very difficult to fossilise,” he said, noting the walls of many of the bones are not much thicker than a sheet of paper. Brusatte said an analysis of the bones revealed the animal was at most a teenager and was still growing, adding the adult wingspan could have been more than three metres. The team also carried out scans of the pterosaur’s skull, allowing them to build a digital model of the brain. The results reveal the animal had very large optic lobes, suggesting it had very good eyesight. Writing in the journal Current Biology, Brusatte and colleagues report how the fossils, which have been unveiled at the National Museum of Scotland, were discovered by PhD student Amelia Penny, who spotted the creature’s skull during fieldwork on the Isle of Skye in 2017. “It didn’t look like anything else I’d seen,” she told the Guardian. “I grew up going to the Natural History Museum in London and reading about Mary Anning’s fossil discoveries on the Jurassic Coast – which definitely influenced my decision to become a palaeontologist,” she added. “But to find a new Jurassic reptile, especially a fossil of this significance, is not something I’d ever dared to expect might happen to me.” Dr David Unwin, an expert in pterosaurs at the University of Leicester who was not involved in the research, said it was debatable whether the newly discovered creature was the largest of its era, noting some fragmented bones from other fossils have already hinted at similar sized pterosaurs in the middle Jurassic. Nonetheless he said the find was significant because fossils dating to that time are scarce, while there are very few pterosaur remains that are as complete. “This new find will allow us to go back to those older collections and understand much better what we’ve got in there,” he said. “It’s a big piece of the puzzle in our evolutionary history of pterosaurs.”",News/Science,Remains of ‘world’s largest Jurassic pterosaur’ recovered in Scotland,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/22/remains-of-worlds-largest-jurassic-pterosaur-recovered-in-scotland
2/22/2022,"The US Senate is not a crowded, rambunctious place like Britain’s House of Commons or other more lively legislative bodies around the world. Members are accustomed to speaking among row after row of empty desks, unheckled by absent colleagues. This has not deterred Senator Sheldon Whitehouse from stepping into the arena to champion urgent causes. For almost nine years the Democrat took to the Senate floor every week the chamber was in session to demand that attention be paid to the climate crisis. He retired the “Time to Wake Up” series last year after 279 speeches only to revive it again this year.  But now he has another alarm to sound. “The Scheme” is a series about the plot by rightwing donor interests to capture the supreme court and achieve through the institution’s power what they cannot through other branches of government. For each speech Whitehouse, whose desk is on the back row, rises to his feet beside a mounted sign with the words “The scheme” superimposed on an image of the court’s exterior. He expounds on the decades-long roots of the masterplan, how it was watered by “dark money” and how it bore full fruit when President Donald Trump installed a six-justice rightwing majority on the court. In an interview with the Guardian, Whitehouse, 66, explains why he has no faith in Trump’s three appointees – Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – and acknowledges the embarrassment that Democrats were “sleeping sentries” as the threat unfolded. But first, does it bother him that he is not playing to a full house, perhaps shouting into the void? “One gets used to it in the Senate,” he says phlegmatically, sitting in a meeting room at his Capitol Hill office adorned with framed photos of lighthouses and starry skies from Rhode Island, the tiny state that he represents. “Actually the last time I went out, a little troop of people who I didn’t recognise came out of the Republican cloakroom and went and sat on the staff bench on the other side and watched and then, when I was done, they trooped back off. I don’t think I have a fanclub but somebody wanted to get a report.” The thread running through Whitehouse’s spoken essays is that the current 6-3 conservative majority on the court is no accident but the product of special interests and dark money – hundreds of millions of dollars in anonymous hidden spending. The special interests are able to groom young judges, promote them in advertising campaigns and then try to influence them in legal briefs, all lacking in transparency. The outcome is a dire threat to the climate, reproductive rights and myriad issues that touch people’s everyday lives. Whitehouse chose his title carefully. “It implies that this is not random,” he says. “This is not just, ‘Oh, we’re conservatives, and so we’re going to appoint conservative thinking judges,’ which is the veneer. They would like to maintain this is just conservatives being conservatives.” Whitehouse suggests that the model of “agency capture”, when an administrative agency is co-opted to serve the interests of a minor constituency, was applied to the supreme court. “Once you’re over that threshold of indecency, it actually turned out to be a pretty easy target. The other construct to bear in mind is covert operations, because essentially what’s happened is that a bunch of fossil fuel billionaires have run a massive covert operation in and against their own country. And that’s a scheme.” The senator has delivered 12 of the speeches so far. The first, last May, was entitled “The Powell Memo”. It focused on Lewis Powell, a corporate lawyer from Virginia in the 1950s and 1960s, a period of political turbulence that rattled America’s corporate elite. The US Chamber of Commerce commissioned from Powell a strategic plan for reasserting corporate authority over the political domain. One section of Powell’s secret report, called “Neglected Opportunity in the Courts”, described “exploiting judicial action” as an “area of vast opportunity”. He added that “with an activist-minded supreme court, the judiciary may be the most important instrument for social, economic and political change”. The report was dated August 1971; two months later, Republican President Richard Nixon nominated Powell to the supreme court. Whitehouse comments: “Having given the US Chamber of Commerce that warning and laid out that strategy, he then went on to the court and in three very significant decisions created a role for corporations in American politics that had never existed and was clearly not something that the founding fathers thought about or would have approved. Since then it’s gotten worse, but he teed it up in those earlier decisions and set the Republican justices of the court on that pathway.” Another key player in the story is the Federalist Society, founded in 1982 by law students who wanted to challenge what they perceived as the dominant liberal ideology. Its co-chairman and former executive vice-president is Leonard Leo, who also advised Trump on judicial selection. The Federalist Society “first showed its fangs” in 2005, Whitehouse says, when President George W Bush chose Harriet Miers for the supreme court. “The Federalist Society came forward to defeat the nomination of an extremely talented lawyer by a Republican president because she was not, to quote what was said at the time, ‘one of us’. “It was at that point that the grip of this little donor elite and Leo, its Federalist Society operative, really took hold. Justice Samuel Alito was the product of that and he has proven himself on the court as being a faithful workhorse for that dark money corporate rightwing crew.” There was no better example than 2010 and the supreme court’s 5-4 ruling in Citizens United v Federal Elec­tion Commis­sion, which allowed wealthy donors, corpor­a­tions and special interest groups to spend unlim­ited cash on elec­tions. Since then an estimated $6bn in dark money, often from nonprofits that are not required to disclose their donors, has poured into political campaigns. The Kryptonite to the scheme is transparency because it would enable the public to follow the money. So donors depend on the court to preserve their anonymity. The senator highlights last year’s case of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation, front group of the wealthy Koch brothers that successfully sued to prevent access to donor information. Not surprisingly the court’s reputation for independence has taken hit after hit and Senate nomination hearings have become partisan bunfights. In 2019 chief justice John Roberts felt compelled to push back: “We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.” “Piffle,” says Whitehouse. “They’ve got to try to keep the veneer. The instant that Roberts admits OK, this is a captured court, we’re here to do dirty deeds for the big donors that got us on to the court, then they kind of blow themselves up.” “So they’re not going to do that. Keeping a veneer that we’re all actually very serious judges here and this is all on the up and up is important to the success of the scheme.” He adds: “The difference is the evidence of their behaviour. There are things that are inexplicable in a legitimate court.” Anonymous donors gave tens of millions of dollars to the Judicial Crisis Network, a rightwing advocacy organisation, to fund advertising campaigns supporting Gorsuch, Kavanaugh or Barrett for the supreme court. Whitehouse does not believe they are impartial justices. Whitehouse predicts that court will “nibble away” at Roe v Wade, the 1973 decision enshrining a woman’r right to abortion. “There are some things that it’s not worth doing all at once and creating a big political blowback,” he says, comparing it to rulings on Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law. “If my theory is correct, they have an eye to the political winds and don’t want to step out too far if they don’t have to. As long as they are continuing to feed the anti-choice base, step by step is fine.” A similar pragmatism may play out when it comes to filling the vacancy left by Stephen Breyer, a liberal justice who last month announced his retirement. Whitehouse, who does not have a preferred candidate, says: “If you’ve captured the court already and you’ve got 6-3 and it’s doing what your big donors want, you don’t want to create a ruckus, you don’t want lots of controversy. It’s going to be 6-3 before; it’s going to be 6-3 after. “The more Mitch can lower the temperature and have everybody think that the supreme court is just normal – nothing to see here, folks – that’s in his interest. The more that the red meat attack is not against the candidate but against Democrat dark money, the more you have success in the propaganda wars to fool the public about what you actually did.” Democrats have been criticised for being complacent as Republicans unspooled their 50-year campaign to capture the courts. Whitehouse agrees. “It’s way late. It’s really embarrassing how we let this dark money crowd steal a march on us.” He observes: “From a political perspective it never mattered as much to the Democratic base as it did to the Republican base because we did not have the history of Roe versus Wade, Brown versus Board of Education [desegregating public schools] decisions that provoked massive cultural objections on the far right. “So they got highly motivated and we did not but then once we saw this machinery begin to go in operation to capture the court, we never bothered to call it out either. It’s not just that our base didn’t care as much. It’s that we were sleeping sentries.” Whitehouse is planning at least three or four more speeches about The Scheme. Like his climate series, he hopes that the message will get through: it is time to wake up. “I hope there’ll be a more general understanding that what’s going on at the court has a lot less to do with conservatism than it has to do with capture and, with any luck, it might cause a bit of an epiphany with some of the judges that they don’t want to be associated with what they’re actually associated with. And the American public will see it for what it is and give us in politics more opportunities to administer a repair.”",News/Law,‘The Scheme’: a senator’s plan to highlight rightwing influence on the supreme court,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/feb/22/the-scheme-senators-highlight-rightwing-influence-supreme-court
2/22/2022,"Nearly 10 years on from his professional debut, and more than 4,000 miles from home, the man once labelled the “Scottish Messi” and who drew interest as a teen from the likes of Real Madrid, Manchester United and Liverpool has at last, in Major League Soccer’s Vancouver Whitecaps, found a home at which he can deliver on his vast potential. Now 26, Ryan Gauld has come a long way in his career – both in terms of distance covered and experiences logged – as he gets ready for the start of the new MLS season, which starts on Saturday. He was once the 17-year-old star of a vibrant young Dundee United side, before a seven-year stint in Portugal brought mixed fortunes.  He left Portugal as a free agent last summer and received no shortage of offers, with big hitters from Scotland and England showing interest after a reputation-rescuing final two years in Portuguese football. “I’ve never been one to make my decisions based on money,” Gauld told the assembled media of his move to Canada. “There is more to a career and more to life than money. The Whitecaps were the first club to reach out to me and make it known how much I was wanted, what they thought I could bring to the club.” Gauld may be overplaying the poverty of a career in MLS a little – his deal last season was worth around $2m. But his decision to eschew proposals from closer to home in favour of North America has been vindicated on the field. With four goals – the last of which came as Vancouver clinched a playoff berth on the final day of the regular season – and five assists to his name last term, he was one of the league’s best performers after his arrival. And it comes as little surprise to those who’ve worked with Gauld that he has once again proven willing to trot the globe. After all he’s been travelling in search of challenges his whole career. Gauld was around 10 when he was first spotted by Dundee United scout Alex Robertson. The midfielder – who has since grown to the not-so-heady height of 5ft 6in – had travelled from his home in Laurencekirk, Aberdeenshire, to play a seven-a-side tournament in Dundee with his grassroots team, Brechin City Boys Club. “Wee Ryan was beating everybody,” Robertson remembers. “He was all left foot, but he was skinning people, taking them on and beating them all. A lot of times when you see people with a lot of ability, they tend to be lazy. They lose the ball, they stop and the don’t do anything about it. If Ryan lost the ball, he would spring up like a yoyo and chase the person to get it back again. You’d have to be blind not to see that he was different. I’ve spent the next 15 years looking and not found anybody as good.” He was swiftly signed by United – along with teammates Harry and John Souttar, now of Stoke City and Hearts, respectively, and whose dad ran the team. So began a three-times-a-week 70-mile round trip to Dundee. The boys enrolled in the Cathro Clinic, former Tottenham coach Ian Cathro’s skills school. Sessions would run from 4.30-6pm on the astroturf pitch at Gussie Park, in the shadow of Tannadice, United’s home stadium. Then, from 6-7.30pm, they’d train with the professional club’s youth set-up. Gauld quickly progressed into the elite group within the Cathro Clinic and made an indelible impression on his coaches. “I looked over and the ball has come in the air,” Steven Leahy, who coached Gauld, remembers of a particularly spectacular moment the young midfielder produced. “You’re thinking, ‘Take a touch, wee man.’ And he doesn’t. He swivelled his body around and did an overhead kick, which was just ridiculous. “I remember Ian stopped the session and made everyone – we had maybe 50 or 60 kids – give him a round of applause.” At 17, Gauld was the focal point of a dynamic Dundee United side that also featured future Liverpool full-back Andrew Robertson and Southampton midfielder Stuart Armstrong. “You could always see that he was a special talent,” says Jackie McNamara, the manager under whom Gauld established himself as a first-team star at Tannadice. “He had a great little football brain. “There were times in training you’d just sit back and laugh. I remember a game against Celtic, a semi-final. He set up the equaliser for Gary Mackay-Steven. Just his decision-making and his weigh of pass, that was the biggest thing about him as a kid. He was a little genius when I worked with him. I loved watching him play.” Interest from some of England’s biggest clubs soon grew, but Gauld had his mind set on a move to the continent. “I think he was always different,” McNamara says. “He saw himself more European [in style] than the hustle and bustle of England.” Of all the European clubs chasing Gauld after his stellar 2013-14 campaign – in which Dundee United finished fourth in the Scottish Premiership and reached the final of the Scottish Cup – Sporting were the most insistent. “They’d done their due diligence on him,” says McNamara. “It was the owner that wanted Ryan. Word came back to me that he loved him, had watched all his clips from his time at Dundee United.” Aged just 18, Gauld signed for Sporting in a £3m deal. As a sign of the youngster’s potential, a €60m release clause was inserted into his contract. He made just five first-team appearances in as many years with the Lisbon giants, though, all of which came in his first season in Portugal. A succession of loans – including a spell back in Scotland with Hibernian in 2018-19 – bore little fruit and his once-promising career began to stagnate. Yet he had embraced life in Portugal. He became fluent in Portuguese and still speaks the language with Cathro, his multilingual mentor. Upon leaving Sporting in 2019, Gauld elected to stay in Portugal, dropping down a tier to join Farense. In his first season with the Algarve club, he scored a career-high nine league goals to fire them back up to the Primeira Division. And last season, despite Farense’s relegation, he scored another nine times and registered seven assists, making him one of only three Primeira Liga players to rank in the top 10 in both categories. Farense initially contested Gauld’s free-agent status last summer. They believed they had a contractual right to extend his deal by a further year, but he countered that the club’s relegation had nullified that clause. Eventually free to join the club of his choosing, Gauld went with the one who’d wanted him most, with Vancouver having chased him since the previous January. The Whitecaps had won just three of their 16 fixtures in the 2021 season before Gauld’s arrival. After his debut they became one of MLS’s form teams. Gauld’s performances proved a catalyst for their playoff hopes, although he couldn’t prevent an eventual first-round exit at the hands of Sporting Kansas City. He has taken the long road to get here – literally and metaphorically – but Gauld is finally thriving. And there’s more to come – whether it’s further MLS stardom, an eventual return to Europe or a belated Scotland debut. “It has taken him a bit longer than I’d have thought to shine,” McNamara says. “But he is still young. He’ll have learned a lot over the last number of years. His football was never in question.” ",Sport/Football,From Dundee to Vancouver via Lisbon: Ryan Gauld’s long road to MLS success,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/22/from-dundee-to-vancouver-via-lisbon-ryan-gaulds-long-road-to-mls-success
2/22/2022,"Nancy Pelosi likely did not expect to set off such a firestorm with her use of three words: free market economy. When the House speaker was asked in December whether she supports proposals to ban members and their spouses from trading individual stocks, she said no. “We’re a free market economy,” Pelosi said. “They should be able to participate in that.”  But Pelosi’s comment sparked ire among government ethics experts and editorial boards, who argued that lawmakers’ ability to glean information from classified briefings and stakeholder meetings raised the possibility of insider trading. Some critics also noted that Pelosi’s husband, Paul, recently netted a gain of more than $5m from trading stocks of Alphabet, Google’s parent company. In the face of backlash, Pelosi has changed her tune on the stock-trading issue, but her hesitation highlighted an uncomfortable truth about how Congresshas responded to the proposal. Despite wide public support for banning lawmakers from trading stocks, members of both parties have expressed anxiety about the idea: a rare moment of bipartisanship in a divided America, but one whose subject – stock-trading politicians – is unlikely to please many voters. Government watchdog groups warn that if Congress fails to act on this issue, it will only intensify many Americans’ concern over how money has tainted their country’s political institutions. The debate over banning members’ stock-trading has been reinvigorated in recent months, after a string of high-profile controversies at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. In February 2020, Republican senator Richard Burr sold hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of stock before the market suffered a severe setback the next month. While he was overseeing those valuable stock trades, Burr was also publicly downplaying the threat of the virus. The justice department investigated Burr and three of his Senate colleagues – Republicans Kelly Loeffler and James Inhofe and Democrat Dianne Feinstein – for potential insider trading, but ultimately no charges were filed. In response to the outcry over those controversies, both Democrats and Republicans have proposed bills to crack down on members’ stock-trading. One bill, introduced by Democratic senators Jon Ossoff and Mark Kelly, would require members, their spouses and their dependent children to place their stock portfolios in a blind trust controlled by an outside party. Republican senator Josh Hawley has proposed a similar bill, although his legislation does not cover dependent children and would not fine members’ salaries for violations, as the Ossoff-Kelly bill would. Over in the House, Democrat Abigail Spanberger and Republican Chip Roy have introduced a similar bill to the Ossoff-Kelly proposal, and more than 50 members have signed on as co-sponsors to the separate Ban Conflicted Trading Act. That bill, which was first introduced by Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi, would ban members and senior congressional staffers from trading individual stocks. “It has really gotten to a point where it’s getting a little bit too difficult for the rest of Congress to ignore,” Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a co-sponsor of Krishnamoorthi’s bill, said at a town hall on Tuesday. “The fact of the matter is, we shouldn’t be able to day-trade the companies whose regulation and whose hearings and whose industries and business is before Congress.” A majority of Americans agree with her. According to a January poll from the progressive firm Data for Progress, 67% percent of US voters say lawmakers should be banned from trading stocks. Another recent survey, conducted by the conservative advocacy group Convention of States Action, found that 76% of voters believe lawmakers and their spouses have an “unfair advantage” in the stock market. It is illegal for members of Congress, or any American, to engage in insider trading. However, insider trading is very difficult to prove, so in 2012, Congress passed the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (Stock) Act to address concerns about lawmakers’ financial activities. The law prohibits members from using information gained through work for their own personal profit, and it requires them to disclose stock trades within 45 days. Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have pointed to the existing legislation to argue against banning members from trading stocks. Republican congressman Pete Sessions has described a ban as unnecessary, while one of his Democratic colleagues, Elaine Luria, attacked the proposal as “bullshit”. “Why would you assume that members of Congress are going to be inherently bad or corrupt? We already have the Stock Act that requires people to report stock trades,” Luria told Punchbowl News earlier this month. “So I’m very strongly opposed to any legislation like that.” Advocates for a stock-trading ban were quick to note that Luria and her husband own millions of dollars worth of stocks in Facebook, Netflix and Apple, among other companies. “Honestly, the stock trades by members of Congress just smell bad … Regardless of which party is doing it, it just doesn’t look good,” said RL Miller, the political director of Climate Hawks Vote. Responding to Luria’s comments specifically, Miller added: “Members of Congress expecting that they don’t prioritize companies in which they’re invested is bullshit.” Miller’s group was one of 18 progressive organizations that signed on to a letter urging Congress to hold a hearing on banning stock trades, arguing that the Stock Act and other existing laws “have not served as a sufficient deterrent to this problem”. Enforcement of the Stock Act also appears to have been spotty at best over the past 10 years. No one has ever been prosecuted under the law, and an investigation by Business Insider found that at least 55 members of Congress and 182 senior congressional staffers were late in filing their stock trades in 2020 and 2021. A late filing is supposed to be punished with a $200 fine that increases with subsequent offenses, but Congress does not keep any public record of such fines, and it’s unclear how often they are collected. “The teeth behind the Stock Act are basically non-existent,” said Dylan Hedtler-Gaudette, government affairs manager at the Project On Government Oversight. “We’re seeing that reporting and disclosure do not actually act as any kind of a deterrent to doing things that look, at the very least, pretty sketchy.” Government watchdog groups also argue that the Stock Act is now somewhat outdated. They say the legislation does not properly account for how lawmakers can use the 24-hour news cycle and social media platforms to impact markets and specific companies’ share prices. “We have seen countless examples of how members – not just as a body but individual members – can influence the stock market with a range of tools at their disposal,” said Donald Sherman, chief counsel for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “Now we’re at a place in history and on the Hill where an individual member of Congress can influence the stock price with a tweet.” Groups like Crew are hopeful that the momentum for passing a stock-trading ban will soon translate into congressional action. Despite her initial reluctance, Pelosi has now adopted a more open-minded tone about the proposals, and the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, has said the upper chamber should address the issue. “I think this is sort of an easy win that will have a very positive impact on policy-making and on public-facing democracy,” Sherman said. The enactment of a stock-trading ban could have the additional benefit of boosting the public’s opinion of Congress, which has suffered in recent years. According to Gallup’s January polling, only 18% of Americans approve of how Congress is handling its job. Advocates for the proposed stock-trading ban say the policy would bolster public confidence in one of America’s most important political institutions. “Anything that can restore Americans’ trust in Congress is a good thing,” Miller said. “This would help rebut that appearance of double-dealing and go a long way toward restoring Americans’ trust in their leadership.” For those members who are hesitant to give up their stocks, Hedtler-Gaudette suggested they should reconsider their chosen career. “To become a member of Congress is an extraordinarily prestigious thing. But it is not compulsory,” Hedtler-Gaudette said. “There are a number of sacrifices that you have to make to run for office … If this is a problem, then you are not required to run for Congress.”",News/US news,Money unites: Republicans and Democrats find rare bipartisanship over stocks,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/22/us-politicians-trading-stocks-bipartisan-idea
2/22/2022,"Residents were rescued from flood water overnight and others were left marooned in their homes as river levels continued to rise in the wake of Storm Franklin. The fire service was called to rescue 14 people and four dogs from a waterlogged village in Shropshire on Monday night due to flooding along the River Severn.  Two severe flood warnings, meaning there is a risk to life, remained in place for parts of the Severn on Tuesday morning. People were urged to evacuate in the historic village of Ironbridge, in Shropshire, and the village of Bewdley, in Worcestershire. The Environment Agency warned that temporary flood barriers in Wharfage, Ironbridge, could be overtopped on Tuesday with river levels reaching nearly 7 metres high. In Bewdley, officials said they expected temporary structures to “exceed their capacity” on Tuesday, meaning flooding to homes and main roads was expected. River levels in the village were not expected to peak until Wednesday afternoon. Nearly 100 flood warnings, meaning flooding is expected, were in place across England on Tuesday morning, mostly along the Severn near the Welsh border and in Yorkshire. Six flood warnings were in place in Wales and three in Scotland. Nearly 30,000 homes in the south of England were braced for a fifth day without power after strong winds and heavy rain blighted attempts to reconnect them after Storm Eunice on Friday. The Energy Networks Association, which represents providers in England and Wales, said that about 10,000 properties in south-west England remained cut off, as well as nearly 8,000 in the south-east and a further 5,700 in the wider south of England. The Met Office said heavy rain and strong winds across Scotland and Northern Ireland were moving south into northern England on Tuesday, with sudden gusty winds and reduced visibility affecting the morning commute for many. There is little sign of any letup in the rain, although the worst of the storms is believed to have passed. More rain is forecast particularly in northern England on Wednesday and Thursday, hampering the recovery effort in flooded areas. In York, river levels are thought to have peaked at 4.53 metres on Tuesday morning, at least 3 metres higher than normal, causing flooding to nearby properties. The current level is only 80cm short of the highest recorded in the centre of York in 2000. Katharine Smith, the flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said: “Heavy rain, affecting already wet areas, is likely to cause significant river flooding along the River Severn until Wednesday. “We have teams out on the ground taking preventive action, closing flood gates, deploying temporary barriers and moving pumps and other response equipment to areas of highest risk. “While a handful of properties have sadly flooded over the past few days, Environment Agency defences have protected more than 40,000 properties despite record river levels. “We advise people to stay away from swollen rivers and not to drive through flood water as just 30cm of flowing water is enough to move your car.”",News/UK news,"Storm Franklin: more wind, rain and flooding expected across UK ",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/22/storm-franklin-more-wind-rain-and-flooding-expected-across-uk
2/22/2022,"French kings found the ideal refuge for their wealth: a city-state nestled between the snow-capped Alps and the pristine waters of Lake Geneva. Catholic royalty flocked to Geneva in the 18th century in an effort to conceal their dealings with Protestant bankers. By 1713, the authorities in Geneva, who would gain a reputation for discretion, introduced rules banning bankers from revealing details about their clients.  That centuries-old code of silence, which was later enshrined in law in Switzerland, came under renewed focus this week after a leak of Credit Suisse data revealed its clients were involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes, suggesting widespread failures of due diligence by the bank. The disclosures prompted a national debate in Switzerland, even though the much-heralded “end of banking secrecy as we know it” was supposed to have occurred in 2014, when ministers from 50 countries and territories agreed to a global exchange of information about their respective taxpayers’ financial information for the first time. The ministerial meeting in Paris that year was deemed monumental, not least because the enfant terrible of banking had reluctantly agreed to join the club. Switzerland had promised to share information about client bank accounts with participating tax authorities around the world. For a country that had criminalised sharing client information with foreign countries for more than 80 years, adoption of the so-called common reporting standard (CRS) was a significant step. It meant Switzerland and fellow signatories would exchange information about foreigners who held bank accounts in their countries, as part of efforts to crack down on tax evasion and fraud. However, even after Swiss CRS data started changing hands in 2018, critics argued the country’s commitment to the system had created a “zebra strategy”. On the one hand, Switzerland’s banks could take “clean” money from clients in industrialised, developed countries, which were part of automatic exchange of information agreements. But the door had not been shut to accepting funds from potentially dubious clients from developing countries, where authorities investigating tax evasion did not have automatic access to their citizens’ secret Swiss accounts. The two-tier system has been criticised by the whistleblower behind the Suisse secrets leak, which has revealed how Credit Suisse provided services to individuals involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes, in countries from Egypt to Ukraine. Within 24 hours, the fallout from the Suisse secrets investigation threatened to engulf other Swiss banks when the largest political grouping of the European parliament, the European People’s party (EPP), called for the EU to review its relationship with Switzerland and consider whether it should be added to its list of countries associated with a high risk of financial crime. What is the Suisse secrets leak? Suisse secrets is a global journalistic investigation into a leak of data from the Swiss bank Credit Suisse. It comprises more than 18,000 bank accounts that were leaked to Süddeutsche Zeitung by a whistleblower who said Swiss banking secrecy laws were ""immoral"". The data, which is only a partial capture of the bank’s 1.5 million private banking clients, is linked to more than 30,000 Credit Suisse clients. The leak includes personal, shared and corporate bank accounts – holding, on average, 7.5m Swiss francs (CHF). Almost 200 accounts in the data are worth more than 100m CHF, and more than a dozen are valued in the billions. While some accounts in the data were open as far back as the 1940s, more than two-thirds were opened since 2000. Many of those were still open well into the last decade, and a portion remain open today. The Guardian was among more than 48 media partners around the world including journalists at Le Monde, NDR, the Miami Herald and the New York Times. They spent months using the data to investigate the bank, in a project coordinated by Süddeutsche Zeitung and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). They unearthed evidence Credit Suisse accounts had been used by clients involved in torture, drug trafficking, money laundering, corruption and other serious crimes, suggesting widespread failures of due diligence by the bank. It is not illegal to have a Swiss account and the leak also contained data of legitimate clients who had done nothing wrong. In its response, Credit Suisse said it ""strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices"". “Despite many claims to the contrary: banking secrecy is not dead,” said Dominik Gross, a tax and finance analyst at Switzerland’s global development thinktank Alliance Sud. More than 90 countries, among them some of the least developed in the world, have yet to exchange banking information with Switzerland. As far as those countries are concerned, “nothing has changed compared with the past”, said Sébastien Guex, a banking expert and professor at the University of Lausanne. “Swiss bankers are still helping the wealthy in these countries to hide their assets from the tax authorities in their own country.” Credit Suisse said it “strongly rejects the allegations and inferences about the bank’s purported business practices” emanating from the Suisse secrets leak of its data, emphasising that it maintained “a strict zero-tolerance policy towards tax evasion and is fully committed to complying with global tax transparency efforts”, including the CRS. Despite signing up to the CRS, the landlocked Alpine country’s financial system is the third-most secretive in the world after the Cayman Islands and the US, according to the Tax Justice Network, and accounts for $21bn in lost tax revenue for foreign countries every year. Nearly half of the 7.9tn Swiss francs (£6.3tn) of assets under management in the country belong to foreign clients. It has helped build an industry that accounts for 10% of Swiss GDP and a similar proportion of Swiss jobs. And while Switzerland is home to about 243 banks, Credit Suisse and its larger rival UBS together make up about half of the country’s banking assets. While Switzerland’s tradition of banking secrecy can be traced to the 1700s, its advantages became most apparent at the turn of the 20th century, when Swiss lenders became a magnet for elites wanting to stash their increasingly mobile wealth in a politically neutral state. Its reputation as a tax haven also grew, as wealthy families scrambled to find somewhere to hide their fortunes amid the introduction of inheritance taxes in countries including France in 1901. Lenders pounced at the opportunity, distributing brochures, advertising in local newspapers and deploying bankers across France to drum up new business. But amid growing anger over the loss of tax revenues and the flight of capital, France launched a police raid on Swiss bankers in Paris in 1932. The operation uncovered the names of hundreds of rich French clients with secret Swiss accounts, including bishops, generals and former ministers. Switzerland’s banking community, in turn, was furious and lobbied for retaliation. By 1934, politicians agreed to put banking secrecy – the “duty of absolute silence” – into law, making it a crime for anyone to share clients’ banking information, particularly with foreign authorities. Controversially, the law, combined with Switzerland’s political neutrality, made the country a haven for Nazi officials. Swiss bankers collaborated heavily with Adolf Hitler and his regime, offering financial credit and helping fleeing Nazis hide their loot after the second world war. Until this week, opposition to banking secrecy within Switzerland has been relatively muted. When the Socialist party held a referendum in the mid-1980s that would have superseded secrecy laws and forced banks to cooperate with foreign authorities investigating tax dodgers, the government opposed the proposal. It was criticised as an invasion of citizens’ privacy and a threat to the the country’s banking system and economy, and was decisively voted down. But elsewhere, global regulators were increasingly frustrated with their inability to penetrate the Swiss banking system in order to investigate global fraud and tax evasion. By the early 2000s, Swiss banks were aggressively marketing their services to wealthy clients who wanted to dodge domestic tax authorities – this time in the US. The details came to light after the UBS banker Bradley Birkenfeld shared information with US authorities in 2007, showing how the bank helped thousands of wealthy Americans avoid paying tax by hiding billions of dollars in secret accounts. Revelations from a subsequent Senate investigation outraged American authorities, who fined UBS and Credit Suisse for their roles in aiding US tax evasion and pushed Switzerland into unilaterally disclosing account information about US taxpayers from 2014. That same year, Switzerland signed on to the CRS alongside 50 other countries and jurisdictions. Against this backdrop, the Swiss banking industry argues its secrecy laws are a thing of the past. “There is no longer Swiss bank client confidentiality for clients abroad,” the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) said, adding that automatic exchange of banking information has “become the norm – for both banks and bank clients”. “Swiss banks have done their homework and implemented all international regulations. We are transparent, there is nothing to hide in Switzerland.” But the Suisse secrets revelations suggest skeletons remain in the vaults of Switzerland’s banks. Campaigners remain concerned about the domestic regulator’s “feeble” powers, and the way criminals and tax dodgers from developing countries appear to continue to gain access to Switzerland’s financial system. The Swiss anti-corruption watchdog Public Eye said organisations such as the SBA were playing down “the harmful impact of this hugely successful business model of the Swiss financial industry, particularly for poorer countries”. Those concerns were echoed by the Nobel laureate and economist Joseph Stiglitz, who said the revelations had rightly put the country’s secrecy laws back in the spotlight. “Surely, Switzerland must know the chilling effect of its legislation: almost surely, that was the intent, to preserve its business models as long as possible, of taking a little slice of the ill-gotten gains of others, in return for providing a safe and secret place to hoard and store the geld,” he said.",News/News,How Swiss banking secrecy enabled an unequal global financial system,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/22/how-swiss-banking-secrecy-global-financial-system-switzerland-tax-elite
2/22/2022,"The estimable Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters has bafflingly decided to try everyone’s patience with this insufferable vanity project: a violent gonzo grossout that sadly conforms to the horror-comedy tendency of being neither properly scary nor properly funny. And it’s founded on the assumption that these real-life badass rock musicians are also pretty hilarious and adorable. In this alternative universe, the Foo Fighters are creatively blocked: we see them sitting around the boardroom table in their record company offices, listlessly bickering. So the irascible corporate suit (Jeff Garlin, phoning it in) sends them to a notorious semi-derelict house with all sort of freaky associations with rock legends of the past, there to work on their new album. It was apparently last used by a troubled band called Dreamwidow, who were tipped to be “the next Jane’s Addiction”. Grohl becomes haunted by the place’s devilish spirits, increasingly obsessed with his own freaky otherworldly vision for the record, as more and more violent and demonic things keep happening.  Will Forte has a small role as the fast-food delivery guy who keeps trying to get Dave to listen to his demo tape. Bad idea. Grohl himself is at least reasonably relaxed, as the band’s much-loved frontman, finally in dire need of exorcism. But there is an awful lot of terrible wooden acting from everyone else, together with sub-Ghostbusters visual effects, for which the movie expects fanbase forgiveness. It does in fact contain one genuinely funny thing, and that is Lionel Richie’s cameo. But it is really quite disconcerting that the film’s comedy setup is about violent and horrible things that happened back in the 90s …? Some of which concerns a person taking their own life …?

2/22/2022,"Couples’ podcasts are very much not for everybody. If they lean a little too far one way, they’re overbearing and smug; too far in the other direction and they become unbearably tense psychodramas. The safest place for you to start is probably Shagged. Married. Annoyed, hosted by married comedians Chris and Rosie Ramsey. A weekly unstructured chat, Shagged. Married. Annoyed is relentlessly lighthearted and unchallenging – and as such, actually very pleasant to listen to. One potential criticism is that the Ramseys do sound like they’re aggressively trying to turn their marriage into a brand. So if that’s not your sort of thing, stop reading now.  A favourite podcast subgenre, arguably invented by Scott Aukerman and Harris Wittels’s Analyze Phish, is one host trying to convince another host that something is good. In Forced Proximity, Megan Montgomery attempts to make her sport-loving husband Johnathon Olavarria see the worth in romance novels. What’s amazing about this podcast is that she very quickly succeeds. As such, most episodes consist of two people united in their love for a type of literature that is perennially written off as trashy. It’s a genuinely uplifting listen. Succession might be between series at the moment, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t go back and explore one of its best offshoots. In Firecrotch & Normcore, married couple DJ Geoff Lloyd and comedian Sara Barron trawl through every episode of Succession’s third series, analysing and bickering about the themes and characters. Better still, they regularly draft in guests to add a third wheel to the dynamic. Nish Kumar, David Baddiel and Lorraine Kelly have all appeared. Trust me when I say that you haven’t lived until you’ve heard Lorraine Kelly call Connor Roy a “noodle”. Myrina and Tristan are a married couple who went on a night out with their friends, realised that their friends were swingers, and as a result ended up falling into a determinedly non-traditional lifestyle. The episodes roughly progress in chronological order, as the couple first become swingers and then start exploring other, more delicate, avenues. They are always open about the pitfalls and boundaries necessary to lead a non-monogamous lifestyle, but seem completely happy with all their choices. If you wanted to use The Accidental Swingers as an instruction guide to swinging, it would probably work well. On the other hand, it’s absolutely perfect for casual rubberneckers. Then there are the podcasts hosted by couples that are actually about being a couple. Of these, ONE Extraordinary Marriage is perhaps the most noteworthy. Hosted by Tony and Alisa DiLorenzo, who were apparently on the brink of divorce until the husband turned things around with something called a 60-day sex challenge, the podcast dips into all the problems that usually throw marriages into trouble – lack of intimacy, lack of communication, lack of respect – and attempts to course-correct its listeners back to happiness.

2/22/2022,"A new variety of snowdrop has sold for £1,850 in an eBay auction. The bulb, which is known as Galanthus plicatus or Golden Tears, was created by the plantsman Joe Sharman, the MailOnline reported.  Sharman, the owner of Cambridgeshire-based Monksilver Nursery and known as Mr Snowdrop, previously sold a snowdrop bulb called Golden Fleece – which took 18 years to develop – for £1,390. The auction site’s listing, which shows the Golden Tears bulb sold for £1,850 after 55 bids, describes the flower as “exceptionally vigorous”. Sharman wrote: “A narrow-flowered yellow pterugiform with a very large mark and bright yellow ovary. Very beautiful and distinct. Quite different from Golden Fleece. Exceptionally vigorous. 25cm. “The result of a deliberate cross by me using the same parents that created Golden Fleece. Only one for the season.” Sharman, who lectures on various topics including snowdrops but also autumn flowers of the Peloponnese and spring flowers of Turkey, says this is his 15th season of selling rare snowdrops on eBay and he has been growing and breeding snowdrops for 35 years. The buyer is unidentified but is likely to be a galanthophile – a collector and identifier of snowdrop species. Describing his love for snowdrops in an interview with the Guardian in 2015, Sharman said: “They come up early in the year when nothing else is growing, so if you have the kind of brain that needs lots of things to think about, you focus in. “They seem to be almost infinitely variable. You collect the 10 you recognise, then you realise that you can recognise 20 and it just goes from there.

Brent crude oil was up nearly 4% on Tuesday morning at just above $99 a barrel, the highest in more than seven years, as fears mounted that supplies would be disrupted.  After sharp falls on Monday, the benchmark Moex Russia Index was down more than 5% on Tuesday morning, while a broad sell-off of European shares followed earlier losses in Asia. Germany’s DAX, France’s CAC and Italy’s FTSE MIB fell about 1%. In London, the FTSE 100 index was down by 0.4%, as oil and gas companies Shell and BP were among the top risers in the UK’s index of blue-chip stocks. The Russia-focused gold miner Petropavlovsk was the biggest faller in the FTSE 250 in early trading, with investors wiping almost 13% off its market value. Shares in Ferrexpo, which mines iron ore in Ukraine for the steel industry, fell 3%. Analysts expect Brent crude will reach $100 a barrel in the coming days, amid supply fears. The price was last above that level in early September 2014. US light crude jumped 5.2% at $95.81. European gas prices surged as much as 13% over fears energy supplies could be restricted as the conflict deepens. Russia is responsible for a third of Europe’s natural gas and about 10% of global oil production. About a third of Russian gas supplies to Europe usually travel through pipelines crossing Ukraine. “The intensifying crisis between Russia and Ukraine has raised concerns about the supply disruptions that would ensue as sanctions look set to cripple Russia, the world’s second largest oil exporter and the world’s top natural gas producer,” said Victoria Scholar, the head of investment at Interactive Investor. “If Putin continues his aggression and the threat of war becomes a reality, oil prices could easily push beyond $100 towards $120 a barrel to fresh highs not seen since 2014.” A wave of international sanctions are expected after Putin moved troops into two Russian-controlled territories in eastern Ukraine, Donetsk and Luhansk, to perform “peacekeeping duties” after signing a treaty recognising their independence. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said the move meant that the “invasion of Ukraine has begun”. “We’re waking up to a very dark day in Europe,” he told Sky News on Tuesday morning. “President Putin has decided to attack the sovereignty of Ukraine and its territorial integrity. We can already tell he has sent in tanks and troops, so I think you can conclude that the invasion of Ukraine has begun.” Boris Johnson chaired an emergency meeting of the Cobra committee on Tuesday morning to establish the UK’s response.

2/22/2022,"Solar panels are not a new way of providing cheap power across much of the African continent, where there is rarely a shortage of sunshine. But growing crops underneath the panels is, and the process has had such promising trials in Kenya that it will be deployed this week in open-field farms. Known as agrivoltaics, the technique harvests solar energy twice: where panels have traditionally been used to harness the sun’s rays to generate energy, they are also utilised to provide shade for growing crops, helping to retain moisture in the soil and boosting growth.  An initial year-long research collaboration between the University of Sheffield and the Kajiado-based Latia Agripreneurship Institute has shown promising results in the semi-arid Kajiado county, a 90-minute drive from the Kenyan capital of Nairobi and this week the full project will be officially launched. For example, cabbages grown under the 180, 345-watt solar panels have been a third bigger, and healthier, than those grown in control plots with the same amount of fertiliser and water. Other crops such as aubergine and lettuce have shown similar results. Maize grown under the panels was taller and healthier, according to Judy Wairimu, an agronomist at the institute. “We wanted to see how crops would perform if grown under these panels,” said Wairimu. But there is another pragmatic reason behind the technology: doubling up the output of the same patch of earth to generate power and cultivate food can go a long way towards helping people with limited land resources, she said. According to Dr Richard Randle-Boggis, a researcher at the University of Sheffield’s Harvesting the Sun Twice project, the trial initiative will determine the potential of agrivoltaic systems in east Africa. “We needed to build a test system to see if this technology will be suitable for the region,” Randle-Boggis said, reiterating that, unlike conventional solar mini-grid systems, agrivoltaics have the additional benefits of improving food and water security, while strengthening people’s resilience against the climate crisis, as well as providing low-carbon electricity. The solar panels do not just reduce water loss from plants and the soil – their shade mitigates some of the stress experienced by plants due to high day temperatures and UV damage, Randle-Boggis said. Agrivoltaics can have a notable impact on household income in remote locations such as Kajiado. “Women here can spend up to 300 Kenyan shillings (£2) on a bodaboda (motorcycle taxi) fare to the market just to buy vegetables worth 100 Kenyan shillings,” said Anne Macharia, head of training at Latia Agrepreneurship Institute. The solar panels can be placed three metres from the ground, providing ample room for a farmer to work below, or higher in bigger systems to allow access for agricultural machinary. Randle-Boggis acknowledged the technology has limitations, but says that in “areas of Kenya which are not currently suitable for horticulture, it may be possible to grow other crops under the improved environmental conditions under the panels”. In other countries including France, the US and Germany, the technology has been employed successfully.",News/Global development,Kenya to use solar panels to boost crops by ‘harvesting the sun twice’,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/22/kenya-to-use-solar-panels-to-boost-crops-by-harvesting-the-sun-twice
2/22/2022,"Face masks have been an essential part of limiting the spread of Covid-19. But for many people who are deaf or hearing-impaired, the coverings have left them isolated from society. When Dean Ezekiel’s wife Aimee, who is partially deaf, attended a pregnancy scan during the first lockdown, she was distraught to find she had no way to determine what the doctor was saying. “Because he was wearing a mask, she couldn’t read his lips. She felt helpless without the use of basic communication,” says Ezekiel. It was that experience that inspired the entrepreneur to start Design Abled and develop Helloface, a transparent, recyclable face mask, which is compatible with facial recognition technology. The startup was recently recognised for its sustainability credentials, winning the microbusiness category at the Heroes of Net Zero competition at Cop26.  Designed in the UK, Ezekiel’s team has worked closely with the Jewish Deaf Association to run focus groups and iterate the design based on user feedback. “The stories about what people are going through are quite heartbreaking,” says Ezekiel, emphasising that in medical care settings, some of the strongest, most confident and successful people in our community can automatically become the most vulnerable. “There are people in hospital beds who can’t tell the nurses that they need to go to the toilet. There are deaf children at school who can’t understand their teachers. And others, like Aimee, who attend medical appointments they can’t participate in,” says Ezekiel. According to government statistics, there are 11 million people in the UK who are deaf or hearing-impaired. Only 87,000 of those know British sign language. Many will instead rely on lip reading and other facial cues to communicate. Research by the charity SignHealth discovered that 74% of deaf people have found it more difficult to access healthcare during the pandemic, and 62% say face masks have been one of the biggest issues related to this. One in three say Covid-19 has had a major negative impact on their mental health. When the pandemic hit, Ezekiel was running the travel company Upgrade, which he’d founded as part of the University of Hertfordshire’s Business Incubator programme. With flights grounded, the university encouraged him to think about other business ideas and pitch them to the group. “I had a few ideas but this was the one that was closest to my heart,” he says. As well as providing office space, marketing and legal advice, and tender writing assistance, the Enterprise Hub Business Incubator and University Enterprise Zone programmes also gave him access to nanotechnology, chemical and material experts from the university, and a specialist pre-compliance certification testing lab. Yanina Aubrey is the head of business growth and entrepreneurship at the University of Hertfordshire. Her team supports between 350 and 400 businesses across a variety of programmes at any one time, from sectors as diverse as manufacturing, the creative industries, hospitality and healthcare. During the pandemic, her team, along with the Hertfordshire Local Enterprise Partnership and the Hertfordshire Growth Hub, launched a volunteer business support scheme, recruiting more than 75 volunteer mentors from the local business community, as well as from within the university’s own business school, to provide advice to SMEs. “It was an incredibly positive experience,” says Aubrey. “Businesses had been desperate for support – they were calling the local growth hub and our own Enterprise Hub and there just weren’t enough hours in the day to answer all of their queries.” The scheme ended up supporting more than 325 local businesses during this difficult period. After more than a year of development, Helloface has released two types of certified masks that will soon be ready for distribution – the transparent medical mask and the P3 half-mask respirator. So far, says Ezekiel, there has been interest from NHS trusts, care homes and social care settings, as well as teachers, childcare providers, and those who work in noisy environments such as factories or building sites. “We’re focusing on healthcare settings first. But ultimately, we want to make sure that anyone who wants them can have them,” he says. Being environmentally friendly has also been a priority. A multidisciplinary group of researchers estimates that if every person in the UK used a single-use mask each day for a year, it would create 66,000 tonnes of contaminated plastic waste. “The materials we use are 100% recyclable, and we partner with local recycling centres so the material is ground down and brought back in pellet form to be reused in production,” says Ezekiel. Encouraging entrepreneurs to think about sustainability is a core focus for the University of Hertfordshire’s Enterprise Hub team, too. “We don’t just want to help businesses grow, we want to help them grow sustainably – and by that we mean sustainability in its broadest sense, including environmental and social factors,” says Aubrey. Sustainability considerations are discussed in the 12-month Incubator Programme, and the university is launching a new 15-week Sustainability Accelerator Programme, funded by the UK government’s Community Renewal Fund, and focused wholly on the development of sustainable products, services or technologies. Aubrey has noticed a shift in how entrepreneurs prioritise sustainability, particularly after Cop26. “Nobody really questions the need to be talking about sustainability today. But businesses still need more training and support. There is a lot of confusion around some of the terminology and it can sometimes feel overwhelming. Sustainability should be part of every entrepreneurial conversation right from the outset, when entrepreneurs are thinking about their concept, their value proposition, their purpose.” For the Helloface team, it was a no-brainer. “We could have done things much easier, much quicker, but we would have created a product that would end up in landfill,” says Ezekiel. “We want to solve a current problem without creating a future problem.” Find out more about the enterprising ecosystem at Herts, and how the university helps businesses to innovate, diversify and grow.",Reimagining sustainability,The face mask that allows deaf people to read lips – and the entrepreneur behind it,https://www.theguardian.com/reimagining-sustainability/2022/feb/22/the-face-mask-that-allows-deaf-people-to-read-lips-and-the-entrepreneur-behind-it
2/22/2022,"Dr Phil Porter is describing the intricate interior of a glacier. “Imagine that the inside of the glacier is like a giant swiss cheese full of tunnels, passageways and caverns,” he says. “Understanding how glaciers work inside is really important in terms of predicting how much melt water will emerge and when.” Last year a study found that the melting of the world’s glaciers has nearly doubled in speed over the past 20 years. Porter, a glacier scientist at the University of Hertfordshire, studies the rate at which glaciers melt, and has worked on projects in the Himalayas – in Pakistan’s Northern Areas and north-east Nepal – looking at the effects of global heating on the amount of meltwater produced.  The ice fields in the Hindu Kush and Himalaya range provide a critical water resource for the 210 million people who live in the region, and much of the wider Asian continent relies on this water, particularly outside of monsoon season. “A sizable proportion of the world’s population is directly or indirectly dependent on snow and ice melt for their water resource for consumption, irrigation and power generation,” says Porter. “Being able to predict how those water supplies are going to change in the future is really, really important.” In some areas, the melting glaciers are making the supply of water more erratic, forcing communities to develop new solutions. Porter gives the example of an innovative local project in the Himalayan region of Ladakh, an area of cold desert where villages rely on water from glacial streams. In April and May, when water is needed for crops, there is insufficient supply. So in the winter months, some of the water is diverted and frozen into large ice towers, or artificial glaciers referred to as “ice stupas”. These stupas then melt in springtime, providing much-needed supplementary supplies of water. The picture in the Himalayas is complex. One reason for this is that the Himalayan range is still rising. This helps encourage processes such as rockfall, which can blanket parts of glaciers with thick layers of rocks and insulate the ice from melt. Despite this, ongoing glacial shrinkage will likely lead to a reduction in overall water supply from the middle of the century. Although warming may trigger increased rainfall to partly offset dwindling glacial water supplies, this will likely increase flood risks. The glacial changes will have far-reaching consequences, says Porter, including potentially for the UK. “I don’t think we fully appreciate how reliant we are on imports from countries that rely on snow and ice melt to support agricultural productivity,” he says, citing tea production, as well as cotton, which is grown extensively in the region and exported globally. Delhi’s air pollutionResearch carried out by Prof Ranjeet Sokhi, professor of atmospheric physics and director of the Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of Hertfordshire, feeds into work to make climate change modelling more precise. It includes examining how air pollution in Delhi – which caused a thick brown smog to envelop the city last November – can be controlled and minimised, and how strategies to adapt to the longer-term impacts of global heating can be improved. Air pollution is the leading environmental risk to health, and the fifth highest global mortality risk in 2017. “The government of India has instigated a clean air programme, with a target of reducing fine particles by 25% compared to 2017,” says Sokhi. “What is lacking is the understanding of the key science drivers behind this air pollution. If we want to have mitigation and adaptation strategies, we have to know what is causing it.” Sokhi is the UK principle investigator for PROMOTE (Process analysis, observations and modelling – integrated solutions for cleaner air for Delhi), whose scientists, from the UK and India, are looking at the processes that drive air pollution, with the aim of more accurate air quality forecasting. Exactly how these processes work is complex. For instance, fine particle emissions are the usual target of air pollution reduction measures. But there are also volatile organic compounds which, combined with nitrogen oxide from vehicle emissions, react with sunlight to produce ozone. “This isn’t new, but quantifying it for Delhi conditions is where we come in,” says Sokhi. Using mathematical models, the scientists can work out the distribution of air pollution in and around Delhi. They are also coupling regional models of air pollution distribution with those that apply at a street scale. “This helps us understand where the hotspots are,” says Sokhi. “As far as we are aware, this has never been done in India before.” Meanwhile Dr Pushp Raj Tiwari, who leads a programme on climate interaction and future changes, addresses the effect of anthropogenic emissions on regional climate extremes (heat waves). His research work with high resolution climate models indicates that minimum winter temperatures across Asia are likely to increase by 2-3 degrees centigrade by 2050, compared with 2000. It shows that in a megacity such as Delhi, with high numbers of vehicles and emissions, air quality will deteriorate along with the health of its inhabitants. This work will feed into the Indian government’s national adaptation plan on air pollution and heat. Ultimately, both Sokhi and Tiwari agree that climate initiatives, green energy, and solar energy need to be better connected with air pollution strategy.

2/22/2022,"Last year the issue of home insulation became an urgent national topic. It began when Insulate Britain activists blocked several of England’s major motorways. Protesters were imprisoned (one went on hunger strike), and a passionate national debate ensued about the tactics used by the campaign group. But whether you approve of its methods or not, the problem remains that the UK has some of the oldest, leakiest – and, as such, least energy-efficient – housing in Europe.  Meanwhile, pre-pandemic, the building sector as a whole accounted for 38% of all global energy-related CO2 emissions – that includes emissions from operating buildings and from construction, according to the UN’s environment programme. “Because that’s such a large proportion of global emissions, there is a significant opportunity to make a big difference – and decarbonising buildings can be a major part of the solution, but it won’t be as easy as it sounds,” says zero-carbon pioneer Prof Ljubomir Jankovic, director of the Centre for Future Societies Research and founder of the Zero Carbon Lab at the University of Hertfordshire. In the UK, the main focus needs to be houses that have already been built, says Jankovic, because they will make up 80% of the housing stock in 2050 – the year the government has pledged to achieve net zero. “That’s 19.1m homes in total that will still be in use – but most aren’t energy efficient, so retrofitting is an essential step,” says Jankovic. “From my calculations, there are more than 10,000 days between now and 2050, so we need to retrofit approximately 1,870 houses per day to reach that goal. That puts the scale of effort required into perspective.” For some properties, retrofitting, or installing new facilities or systems, might include improved insulation and making properties more airtight; for others, it could require the addition of heat pumps, solar panels and, in the near future, a new type of hydrogen boiler. “Without retrofitting, we won’t reach net zero by 2050,” says Jankovic. New buildings may also be adding to the challenge. “At the moment, building regulations don’t require new builds to be net zero, so we are contributing to the number of houses that will need retrofitting, even though some are new.” One major factor to consider is the embodied carbon emissions within conventional building materials such as brick and concrete – that’s the carbon emissions involved in making the material, transporting it to site and using it in construction. Jankovic and his team at the Zero Carbon Lab, a centre that collaborates with government bodies, local authorities and industry, have calculated that bricks have embodied emissions of about 357kg CO2 per cubic metre, while a cubic metre of concrete is about 10 times higher. “Although these embodied emissions are not always taken into account, they all end up in the atmosphere and add to the challenge of controlling climate change,” says Jankovic. It will take way beyond 2050 to reach net zero if these materials continue to be used without consideration for their embodied emissions, he says, even with the addition of renewable energy systems and energy-efficient retrofitting. But there is another low-carbon option. Jankovic’s research shows that using biosourced materials that can reduce the starting embodied emissions, such as hempcrete or hemp lime instead of brick, could help to reach net zero by 2045 in new builds, in concert with other net zero design strategies. In his view, new research is required in order to update reference information on embodied emissions in other biosourced materials, such as straw bale, timber and others, which “sequester” carbon from the atmosphere during the plant growth period. Currently, this information is not readily available for designers. Working with Welwyn Hatfield borough council in Hertfordshire, Jankovic’s research into zero carbon building design is helping the authority to reduce the cost of powering buildings with renewable energy, improve insulation and opt for greener building materials. He is also assisting Stevenage borough council to evaluate how best to get to net zero by 2030. Using advanced modelling and simulation of dynamic heat transfer, Jankovic and his team can calculate the emissions of a building over a specific time period, based on hourly weather data gathered over a year – that’s 8,760 sets of data, whereas simplified methods based on 12 monthly average sets of data and steady state heat transfer gave far less accurate results. This larger volume of data makes a difference, allowing for more rigorous analysis. “We need to quantify everything, from the starting emissions to ongoing emissions, and ‘pushing and poking’ these computer models in a structured way helps us to determine how we get to zero,” he says. Jankovic is working on making these technical methods accessible to councils and local authorities so they can use preset designs to achieve net zero with more confidence. Ultimately, change happens at the design stage before a new build or a retrofit. “Everyone needs to understand what it means to design net zero emissions buildings – presently, industry doesn’t have enough people who are qualified to do net zero design that’s based on rigorously tested performance data,” he says. “But if we really want to get serious about reaching net zero we need to improve the skills across the industry and to all pull together, from developers to construction workers, to planners, architects and building performance modellers, to create a critical mass of new professionals capable of designing and delivering buildings with a certainty of performance outcomes.” Find out more about the game changing multi-disciplinary research at Herts, how it is deepening understanding of climate change and helping to tackle the environmental emergency.",Reimagining sustainability,"‘Without retrofitting, we won’t reach net zero’: can we make our homes carbon neutral by 2050?",https://www.theguardian.com/reimagining-sustainability/2022/feb/22/without-retrofitting-we-wont-reach-net-zero-can-we-make-our-homes-carbon-neutral-by-2050
