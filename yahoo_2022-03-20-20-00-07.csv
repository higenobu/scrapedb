3/20/2022,"LONDON, March 19 (Reuters) - Russia said on Saturday that it had used hypersonic Kinzhal (Dagger) missiles to destroy a large weapons depot in Ukraine's western Ivano-Frankivsk region. Russia's Interfax news agency said it was the first time Russia had deployed the hypersonic Kinzhal system since it sent its troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24. Defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov told a briefing that the underground depot hit by the Kinzhal system on Friday housed Ukrainian missiles and aircraft ammunition, according to a recording of the briefing shared by Russian news agencies. Reuters was not able to independently verify Konashenkov's statements. The office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Russia prides itself on its advanced weaponry, and President Vladimir Putin said in December that Russia was the global leader in hypersonic missiles, whose speed, manoeuvrability and altitude make them difficult to track and intercept. The Kinzhal missiles are part of an array of weapons unveiled in 2018. Konashenkov added on Saturday that Russian forces had also destroyed military radio and reconnaissance centres near the Ukrainian port city of Odessa using the Bastion coastal missile system. Moscow refers to its actions in Ukraine as a ""special operation"" to weaken its southern neighbour's military capabilities and root out people it calls dangerous nationalists. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and Western countries have imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.

3/20/2022,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Vladimir Putin on Friday again painted his enemies in Ukraine as “neo-Nazis,” even though the country has a Jewish president who lost relatives in the Holocaust and who heads a Western-backed, democratically elected government. The Holocaust, World War II and Nazism have been important tools for Putin in his bid to legitimize Russia’s war in Ukraine, but historians see their use as disinformation and a cynical ploy to further the Russian leader’s aims. Israel has proceeded cautiously, seeking not to jeopardize its security ties with the Kremlin, despite what it considers the sacred memory of the 6 million Jews who were murdered by the Nazis in the Holocaust. Here's a closer look at how the ghosts of the past are shaping today's conflict: THE WAR THAT DEFINES RUSSIA World War II, in which the Soviet Union lost an estimated 27 million people, is a linchpin of Russia’s national identity. In today's Russia, officials bristle at any questioning of the USSR’s role. Some historians say this has been coupled with an attempt by Russia to retool certain historical truths from the war. They say Russia has tried to magnify the Soviet role in defeating the Nazis while playing down any collaboration by Soviet citizens in the persecution of Jews. On Ukraine, Russia has tried to link the country to Nazism, particularly those who have led it since a pro-Russian leadership was toppled in 2014. This goes back to 1941 when Ukraine, at the time part of the Soviet Union, was occupied by Nazi Germany. Some Ukrainian nationalists welcomed the Nazi occupiers, in part as a way to challenge their Soviet opponents, according to Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust memorial. Historians say that, like in other countries, there was also collaboration. Some of Ukraine’s politicians since 2014 have sought to glorify nationalist fighters from the era, focusing on their opposition to Soviet rule rather than their collaboration and documented crimes against Jews, as well as Poles living in Ukraine. But making the leap from that to claiming Ukraine’s current government is a Nazi state does not reflect the reality of its politics, including the landslide election of a Jewish president and the aim of many Ukrainians to strengthen the country’s democracy, reduce corruption and move closer to the West. “In terms of all of the sort of constituent parts of Nazism, none of that is in play in Ukraine. Territorial ambitions. State-sponsored terrorism. Rampant antisemitism. Bigotry. A dictatorship. None of those are in play. So this is just total fiction,” said Jonathan Dekel-Chen, a history professor at Jerusalem's Hebrew University. What's more, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is Jewish and has said that three of his grandfather's brothers were killed by German occupiers while his grandfather survived the war. That hasn't stopped Russian officials from comparing Zelenskyy to Jews who were forced to collaborate with the Nazis during the Holocaust. HOLOCAUST DISTORTION Putin's attempts to stretch history for political motives is part of a trend seen in other countries as well. Most prominently is Poland, where authorities are advancing a nationalist narrative at odds with mainstream scholarship, including through a 2018 law that regulates Holocaust speech. The legislation sought to fight back against claims that Poland, a victim of Nazi Germany, bore responsibility for the Holocaust. The law angered Israel, where many felt it was an attempt to whitewash the fact that some Poles did kill Jews during the German occupation during World War II. Yad Vashem also came out against the legislation. Havi Dreifuss, a historian at Tel Aviv University and Yad Vashem, said the world was now dealing with both Holocaust denial and Holocaust distortion, where countries or institutions were bringing forth their own interpretations of history that were damaging to the commemoration of the Holocaust. “Whoever deals with the period of the Holocaust must first and foremost be committed to the complex reality that occurred then and not with wars over memory that exist today,” she said. ISRAELI INTERESTS The Holocaust is central to Israel’s national identity. The country comes to a two-minute standstill on its Holocaust remembrance day. Schoolchildren, trade groups and soldiers make regular trips to Yad Vashem’s museum. Stories of the last cohort of Holocaust survivors constantly make the news. Israel has butted heads with certain countries, including Poland, over the memory of the Holocaust. But Israel has appeared more reticent to challenge Putin and his narrative, according to some observers, because of its current security interests. Israel relies on coordination with Russia to allow it to strike targets in Syria, which it says are often weapons caches destined for Israel’s enemies. Israel came under fire from historians in 2020 after a speech by Putin and a separate video presentation at a meeting of world leaders in Jerusalem to commemorate the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp, which they said skewed toward his narrative and away from the historical facts. Israel was conspicuously muted in its criticism of Russia in the lead-up to the war on Ukraine. Commentator Raviv Drucker wrote in the daily Haaretz that Israel was “on the wrong side of history” with its response, which initially sought to support Ukraine while not rattling Russia. Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid has repeatedly condemned Russia’s invasion. But Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has stopped short of issuing a public condemnation of Russia. Through that neutral stance, he has emerged as an unlikely mediator between Kyiv and Moscow. Vera Michlin-Shapir, a former official at Israel’s National Security Council and the author of “Fluid Russia,” a book about the country's national identity, said that Israel's regional security concerns were of greater interest than challenging Russia on its narrative. “Russia can provide weapons systems to our worst enemies and therefore Israel is proceeding very cautiously — you could say too cautiously — because there is an issue here that is at the heart of Israel’s security,” she said.",World/Associated Press,EXPLAINER: Why Putin uses WWII to justify war with Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/explainer-why-putin-uses-wwii-194729106.html
3/20/2022,"More than 3 million Ukrainians have fled the only place they’ve ever called home since Russia invaded their country on Feb. 24, with most seeking refuge in neighboring European nations like Poland, Romania and Moldova. Almost all these countries have accepted fleeing Ukrainians with open arms. It’s a welcome sight for Ukrainians and migration experts alike — but also a somewhat curious one. The reception of Ukrainian refugees by European countries has been vastly different from previous refugee crises where European countries were largely resistant to being a safe haven for those escaping persecution, including the ongoing Syrian refugee crisis, where since 2015 more than 1 million Syrians have sought refuge in Europe with little to no support. “It's a striking difference,” Lamis Abdelaaty, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University, told Yahoo News. Some experts believe that proximity is the most obvious reason for the discrepancy, as Ukraine shares a border with seven other European countries, while others have suggested cultural factors — commonality in race and religion — play the biggest part. In a Twitter thread earlier this month, Abdelaaty, author of “Discrimination and Delegation: Explaining State Responses to Refugees,” argues that the difference in treatment boils down to identity and foreign policy. “Ukrainians are seen as white, Christian,” Abdelaaty explained. “Syrians, Afghans, and others are not perceived this way. People sympathize with refugees who they think share their race, religion, etc. But identity is not the whole story.” “There is a foreign policy dimension to this too,” she added. “It matters that Ukrainians are fleeing a Russian invasion. Welcoming them is another way for European countries to condemn Putin and to powerfully signal which side of the conflict they are on.” NATO member countries throughout Europe have been cautious about their involvement in the Russia-Ukraine conflict thus far, choosing to supply weapons to Ukraine and apply financial sanctions to Russia instead of any direct confrontation that they argue could ignite a third world war. Even so, some critics see a double standard in how Ukrainian refugees are being treated compared with asylum seekers from other countries. Poland, which has accepted more than 60% of the 3 million Ukrainian refugees, was a big detractor of Syrian refugees just a few years ago. The leader of Poland's conservative party and current deputy prime minister, Jarosław Kaczyński, has been one of the most outspoken critics against refugees. In 2017, he said that accepting Syrians would be dangerous and would ""completely change our culture and radically lower the level of safety in our country."" Now European leaders are praising the continent’s largely unified response. “The response by Europe has been remarkable,” the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, said in a statement. While European countries currently host more than 1 million of the 6.6 million Syrians who have fled civil war in their country in the past decade, the overwhelming majority have been accepted by only two countries — 59% live in Germany and 11% relocated to Sweden, according to data from the U.N. refugee agency. But accepting those refugees was a controversial decision, Kelly Petillo, coordinator of the Middle East and North Africa program at the European Council on Foreign Relations, told ABC News. “It came after quite a bit of internal back and forth and lack of disagreement,” Petillo said, noting that it wasn’t until after the European Union came to an agreement with Turkey that Syrians were accepted into the region. “Since the Syria crisis erupted more than 10 years ago, we’ve seen that there was a high level of reluctancy from Europeans to share the burden amongst themselves,” she said. Abdelaaty also notes a striking difference in the framing of the Syrian refugee crisis and the Ukrainian refugee crisis. “In 2016, [the Syrian refugee influx] was framed as a huge ‘crisis for Europe,’ and it was a crisis for how European countries were going to respond to this,” she said, adding that Syrians were labeled as migrants, not refugees, as a way to “delegitimize their request for protection.” Abdelaaty believes that the Ukrainian crisis is being framed in such a way that leads others to have empathy for those fleeing the conflict — which she says is the right thing to do, but questions why this courtesy hasn’t been extended for everyone. But not all experts agree that Europe’s warm reception to Ukrainian refugees is simply an issue of identity or foreign policy. Thomas Gammeltoft-Hansen, a professor of migration and refugee law at the University of Copenhagen and author of “Access to Asylum: International Refugee Law and the Globalization of Migration Control,” says there is another major factor at play. Long before Russia invaded Ukraine, Ukrainian leadership and the European Parliament had agreed on a visa liberation agreement in 2017, which granted Ukrainians visa-free access to all of Europe. Gammeltoft-Hansen says this makes it easier for European countries to accept Ukrainian refugees. “The preexisting mobility rights of the Ukrainians means that they circumvent the entire kind of deterrence logic upon which migration policy has been based for the last 30 years,” he told Yahoo News. “The mobility element upends everything we thought we knew about how the EU handles refugee flows.” According to Gammeltoft-Hansen, Europe’s response to the Balkan refugee crisis in 2015, the Southeast Asian refugee crisis in the 1970s and the Hungarian crisis in 1956 — which all resulted in European resettlement after substantial opposition — all suggest that both political context, not simply proximity, plays the primary role in the ongoing crisis. “The Ukrainian response looks a lot like some of the big refugee crises during the Cold War,” he said. “There is sometimes a willingness to welcome refugees as a way of scoring ideology points, which can be a way of politically signaling a a degree of affiliation rather than engaging in direct conflict.” Gammeltoft-Hansen describes the current refugee crisis in Europe as a “historically unique political and socioeconomic experiment” that will ultimately set a precedent on what allocation of resources looks like throughout the region and how countries can come together through “spontaneous responsibility sharing.” However, not all refugees fleeing Ukraine have had the same experience. African and Indian men and women, many of whom went to Ukraine to further their education, have regularly reported being denied space on trains or buses or faced ridicule at the border. They have complained of a sometimes hostile reception from Ukrainian authorities and officials from other European countries that have by and large taken in scores of Ukrainians. This disparity in treatment, for many, illustrates a hypocritical attitude they say has always been present across Europe. “There was a gap in the access Black people and brown people were getting,” Patricia Daley, one of three women who founded Black Women for Black Lives as a way to help Black people escape Ukraine, told NBC News. “There was no one offering their homes to Black people, no one offering to pick up the Black individuals. There was a tremendous amount of people offering help and support, but I feel like it was limited to Ukrainian nationals alone. And we know what that means. It’s excluding a group of people. There was a need to support Black people because they weren’t getting the support or access. There was a gap and we bridged it.” Damilare Yusef, a British-Nigerian man, said he jumped into crisis management mode when he saw the plight of African refugees trying to escape Ukraine. He used social media apps like Telegram and Twitter to coordinate help for those in need. “In the beginning it was important to have a clear message with Africans in Ukraine … so people understood the message of it’s not just Nigerians, it’s not just Ghanians,” Yusef told Yahoo News. “When you band together, it’s just easier.” As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine enters its fourth week, there is no doubt that the number of refugees seeking safety in European countries will continue. For Abdelaaty, the acceptance of those in need is necessary, but it shouldn’t stop at Ukrainians. “This is exactly what they should be doing,” she said. “But bring this empathy to other refugee groups, because the same scenes that we're seeing in Ukraine, we see in other refugee crises as well. ... All of these scenes are not unique to the Ukrainian refugee crisis.” _____ Cover thumbnail photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: Spencer Platt/Getty Images, Aris Messinis/AFP via Getty Images",World/Yahoo News,Does the Ukrainian refugee response expose a European double standard?
