1/21/2022,"TOKYO (AP) — Restaurants and bars will close early in Tokyo and a dozen other areas across Japan beginning Friday as the country widens COVID-19 restrictions due to the omicron variant, which has caused cases to surge to new highs in metropolitan areas. The restraint, which is something of a pre-state of emergency, is the first since September and is scheduled to last through Feb. 13. With three other prefectures — Okinawa, Hiroshima and Yamaguchi — under similar measures since early January, the state of restraint now covers 16 areas, or one-third of the country. While many Japanese adults are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, few have gotten a booster shot, which has been a vital protection from the highly contagious omicron variant of the coronavirus. The Health Ministry on Friday approved Pfizer vaccinations for children aged 5-11, who are increasingly vulnerable to infection. Throughout the pandemic, Japan has resisted the use of lockdowns to limit the spread of the virus and has focused on requiring eateries to close early and not serve alcohol, and on urging the public to wear masks and practice social distancing, as the government seeks to minimize damage to the economy. Under the latest measures, most eateries are asked to close by 8 or 9 p.m., while large events can allow full capacity if they have anti-virus plans. In Tokyo, certified eateries that stop serving alcohol can stay open until 9 p.m. while those serving alcohol must close an hour earlier. Restaurants that close at 9 p.m. and don't serve alcohol receive 30,000 yen ($263) per day in government compensation, while those that close at 8 p.m. get 25,000 yen ($220) per day. Critics say the measures, which almost exclusively target bars and restaurants, make little sense and are unfair. Mitsuru Saga, the manager of a Japanese-style “izakaya” restaurant in downtown Tokyo, said he chose to serve alcohol and close at 8 p.m. despite receiving less compensation from the government. “We cannot make business without serving alcohol,” Saga said in an interview with Nippon Television. “It seems only eateries are targeted for restraints.” Some experts question the effectiveness of placing restraints only on eateries, noting that infections show no signs of slowing in the three prefectures that have already been subjected to the measures for nearly two weeks. After more than two years of repeated restraints and social distancing requests, Japanese are increasingly becoming less cooperative to such measures. People are back to commuting on packed trains and shopping at crowded stores. Tokyo's main train station of Shinagawa was packed as usual with commuters rushing to work Friday morning. Japan briefly eased border controls in November but quickly reversed them to ban most foreign entrants when the omicron variant began spreading in other countries. Japan says it will stick to the stringent border policy through the end of February as the country tries to reinforce medical systems and treatment. The tough border controls have triggered criticism from foreign students and scholars who say the measures are not scientific. A group of scholars and Japan-U.S. experts recently launched a petition, led by Japan Society head Joshua Walker, calling on Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and his government to allow foreign scholars and students to enter the country again under careful preventive measures. A letter to Kishida, signed by hundreds of academics and experts in Japan-U.S. studies, urged his government to relax border controls to allow educators, students and scholars to enter Japan and pursue their academic activity. Many of them have been forced to give up Japan studies and focus instead on other countries, including South Korea. “They become the bridges between Japan and other societies. They are future policymakers, business leaders, and teachers. They are the foundation of the U.S.-Japan alliance and other international relationships that support Japan’s core national interests,” the letter said. “The closure is harming Japan’s national interests and international relationships.” Japan recently announced it will allow 87 students on Japanese government scholarships to enter the country, but petitioners say there are many others on foreign government-sponsored scholarships who still cannot get in. Tokyo logged 8,638 new cases of coronavirus infection Thursday, exceeding the previous record of 7,377 set the day before. At a Tokyo metropolitan government task force meeting, experts sounded the alarm at the fast-paced upsurge led by omicron. Norio Ohmagari, Director of the Disease Control and Prevention Center of National Center for Global Health and an advisor to the Tokyo metropolitan government panel, said Tokyo’s daily new cases may exceed 18,000 within a week if the increase continues at the current pace. Though only some of the soaring number of infected people are hospitalized and occupying less than one-third of available hospital beds in the Japanese capital, experts say the rapid upsurge of the cases could quickly overwhelm the medical systems once the infections further spread among the elderly population who are more likely to become seriously ill. Surging infections have begun to paralyze hospitals, schools and other sectors in some areas. The ministry has trimmed the required self-isolation period from 14 days to 10 for those who come into close contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19, and to seven days for essential workers if they test negative. While about 80% of Japanese have received their first two vaccine doses, the rollout of booster shots has been slow and has reached only 1.4 % of the population so far.",World/Associated Press,Japan widens virus restrictions as omicron surges in cities,https://news.yahoo.com/japan-widens-virus-restrictions-omicron-011347150.html
1/21/2022,"A US Military drone unit struck Syria's largest dam in 2017, despite it being on a 'no-strike' list, The New York Times reported. The New York Times reported that the strike used some of the largest conventional bombs. Tens of thousands were at risk of flooding in a narrowly avoided catastrophe, according to the report. A US Special Operations drone unit struck the largest dam in Syria in 2017, despite the location being on a US military ""no-strike"" list because of potential flooding risks for hundreds of thousands nearby, according to The New York Times. According to two former senior officials with Task Force 9, the responsible unit, operators used some of the largest conventional bombs in its arsenal, including one that weighed 2,000 pounds. Task Force 9 struck the 18-story Taqba dam along the Euphrates River on March 26, 2017, The Times reported citing former officials in the unit, despite a US military report that indicated that a strike on the dam could cause flooding that could kill tens of thousands who live nearby and wipe out entire surrounding villages. At the time of the strike, ISIS occupied the region in Syria and oversaw the operation of the dam. According to The Times, the US was blamed by ISIS, Russia, and the Syrian government for the strike at the time. Then-Lt. Gen. Stephen J. Townsend, however, dismissed the charge as ""crazy reporting."" ""The Tabqa Dam is not a coalition target,"" Townsend said after the blast. US Central Command, the US military command center that oversees combat operations in the Middle East could not immediately be reached for comment, but a spokesperson for the agency told The Times that only the dam's operating towers were targeted, instead of the walls of the dam itself. According to the report, it was through a mix of luck and a team of sharp local engineers that a major flood was avoided. Syrian engineers on the scene told The Times that one of the bombs dropped remained unexploded on the fifth floor of the complex, and they were able to safely dispose of the bomb, which may have otherwise taken out the structure. The two former drone operators said that critical equipment for the operation of the dam was destroyed, and the dam's reservoir rose 50 feet, nearly spilling and forcing northern dams in Turkey to momentarily pause their water flow. According to the report, a ceasefire was temporarily declared between warring sides in Syria to allow engineers to restore the dam's function and avoid disaster. ""The destruction would have been unimaginable,"" the dam's former director told The Times on condition of anonymity. ""The number of casualties would have exceeded the number of Syrians who have died throughout the war.""

1/21/2022,"On Thursday night, Jimmy Kimmel gleefully ran down the significant legal problems facing former President Donald Trump during his monologue. “The legal woes for Trump are piling up,” said Kimmel. “The attorney general in New York says she has evidence that the Trump Organization engaged in a pattern of deception, and today we learned that the DA in Fulton County, Georgia, has requested a special grand jury to look into his post-election shenanigans there. On top of that, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the special committee that’s looking into the insurrection to review 700 pages of documents Trump wanted kept secret, and we got an update from Congress today on what Trump was doing behind closed doors in the lead-up to Jan. 6.” Yes, according to Trump’s former press secretary Stephanie Grisham, Trump held top secret closed-door meetings at the Executive Residence of the White House just prior to the Jan. 6 insurrection, and attendees were not officially recorded to keep it off the books. Furthermore, the attendees in the meetings were brought into the Executive Residence, where the president lives, by the White House chief usher, a bespectacled, unassuming fellow by the name of Timothy Harleth. “[It] could mean that Timothy Harleth would be subpoenaed by the committee, which would be a big deal for a guy whose only job at the White House seemed to be, based on what comes up on Google Images when you search his name, picking out the White House Christmas tree,” Kimmel quipped. How Bob Saget Ended Up in the First Great Stand-Up Special of 2022 (For the record, the White House chief usher’s job is far more extensive than this and includes overseeing operations at the White House Complex and Executive Residence, from budgeting to scheduling. President Biden promptly fired Harleth on his first day in office.) “That could be the guy who brings Trump down! Timothy!” Kimmel exclaimed. “A soldier in the War on Christmas could be the guy to do this.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

1/21/2022,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's new coalition government wants to attract 400,000 qualified workers from abroad each year to tackle both a demographic imbalance and labour shortages in key sectors that risk undermining the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. ""The shortage of skilled workers has become so serious by now that it is dramatically slowing down our economy,"" Christian Duerr, parliamentary leader of the co-governing Free Democrats (FDP), told business magazine WirtschaftsWoche. ""We can only get the problem of an ageing workforce under control with a modern immigration policy... We have to reach the mark of 400,000 skilled workers from abroad as quickly as possible,"" Duerr added. Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats, Duerr's libertarian FDP and the environmentalist Greens agreed in their coalition deal on measures like a points system for specialists from countries outside the European Union and lifting the national minimum wage to 12 euros ($13.60) per hour to make working in Germany more attractive. The employer-friendly German Economic Institute estimates that the labour force will shrink by more than 300,000 people this year as there are more older workers retiring than younger ones entering the labour market. This gap is expected to widen to more than 650,000 in 2029, leaving an accumulated shortage of people of working age in 2030 of roughly 5 million. The number of Germans in employment grew to nearly 45 million last year despite the coronavirus pandemic. After decades of low birth rates and uneven migration, a shrinking labour force also poses a demographic time bomb for Germany's public pension system, in which fewer employees are burdened with the task of financing the pensions of a growing mass of retirees who are enjoying longer life expectancy.
