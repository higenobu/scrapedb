2/27/2022,"The Royal Opera House cancelled a season of performances by Moscow’s famed Bolshoi Ballet, European football’s governing body took the Champions League final away from St Petersburg, and a host of Russian businesses were rocked by resignations of big-name European directors. In the hours and days following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, it became clear that Russia is no longer a welcome member of western society. For a long time, Russia appeared to be working tirelessly on its “soft power” credentials, spending billions of roubles to portray itself as a welcoming member of the international community, one that was a victim of western bias and “Russophobia”. Despite the Crimean annexation of 2014 and the jailing of opposition leaders, the Kremlin often looked to be successful in its mission, winning the rights to host leading sporting and cultural events, giving it a global platform to carefully construct its image for the outside world. “Do not try to paint with a dark paint everything that comes from the east,” Fifa’s president Gianni Infantino said during the build-up to the 2018 football World Cup, referring to the tournament’s host, Russia. A year after the event, Infantino returned to Moscow to receive a state medal from Putin, whom he thanked for hosting the “best World Cup ever”. “The world has created bonds of friendship with Russia that will last for ever,” a smiling Infantino said. The “for ever” friendship lasted until Thursday, when Putin ordered his troops to enter Ukraine, unleashing a bloody war that had been unimaginable to many. “Russia has become as toxic as it gets for the west, and the war is not yet over,” said Russian political analyst Anton Barbashin. “We can’t even start to imagine what kind of price all us Russians and the Russian state will have to pay for this.” The International Olympic Committee has called on all sports federations to cancel any events in Russia, while Uefa is said to be considering ending Gazprom’s sponsorship of the Champions League. On Friday Manchester United dropped Aeroflot as their sponsor, while the Poland and Sweden national football teams said they would refuse to play Russia in March World Cup qualifiers, putting Moscow’s participation in the tournament it hosted just four years ago into question. The country will also be excluded from this year’s Eurovision song contest, with organisers saying its participation could “bring the competition into disrepute”. But the repercussions of Russia’s actions will stem far beyond exclusion from sporting and cultural events. Europe’s far-right, which for a long time idolised the country as leading the conservative front against the “woke” west, rushed to condemn their former ally’s actions. French far-right politician Marine Le Pen on Thursday called Russia’s moves unjustified, and said they must be condemned “without ambiguity.” Anton Shekhovstov, the director of the Centre for Democratic Integrity and the author of the book, Russia and the Western Far Right, said Europe’s populists had no choice but to reject Russia. “There is an unprecedented consensus in Europe condemning the Russian aggression. The country is so toxic that even the far right have to distance themselves from them,” he said Strongmen in central and eastern Europe, who for years looked to Putin as an alternative to the liberal western model of democracy, similarly reacted in shock. Yesterday Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, previously considered Putin’s closest EU ally, said Hungary would support all EU sanctions against Russia. Czech President Miloš Zeman, who had in the past pushed for warm relations with Moscow, said Russia’s attack on Ukraine was a “crime against peace”. “A few days ago, I said that the Russians were not crazy and that they would not attack Ukraine. I admit I was wrong,” Zeman said. The invasion has also led to a mass exodus of former European officials from the boards of state-owned Russian companies. For years, the Kremlin had been wooing former western officials, a strategy seen as one of Russia’s last instruments in garnering political leverage among elites in the west. Last Thursday the former prime ministers of Finland and Italy and the ex-chancellor of Austria resigned from boards of Russian companies. Christian Kern, Austria’s former chancellor, said he had “no choice” but to quit from the board of Russian Railways (RZD). “RZD had now actually become part of Russian war logistics,” Kern told local media. “My thoughts are with the victims of this senseless aggression.” Former French prime minister Francois Fillon, who has previously criticised the west for its handling of the Ukrainian crisis on Friday resigned from the boards of two Russian firms in protest. “This is a collective failure, but in the hierarchy of responsibilities, Vladimir Putin alone is guilty of having started a preventable conflict,” Fillon wrote in an opinion piece published in the French weekly paper Le Journal du Dimanche. Pressure will be put on Germany’s former chancellor Gerhard Schröder, a self-described “friend” of Vladimir Putin who continues to sit on the board of a number of prominent Russian companies, including the sanctioned Rosneft firm. Back in Moscow,Putin last Thursday gathered more than 30 top executives and business owners in the Kremlin, seeking support in the face of western sanctions. Many in the room, like Alfa-Bank founder Petr Aven and Novatek chairman Leonid Mikhelson, have in the past mingled in western high society, collaborating with major European art and cultural institutions while owning elite property across Europe. While veteran businessmen like Aven have not been hit personally by sanctions, experts believe the standing of rich Russians in the west will be tarnished. “It will be much harder for the oligarchs to show their faces in London. My guess is that they will try to somehow portray an image that they don’t support this invasion,” said Elisabeth Schimpfössl, who has published research on the Russian elite abroad. The Russian leader will demand “total loyalty” from the business elite, she said. “In the eyes of Putin, you are either with him or against him. Any middle ground is now gone.”",News/World news,"Football, Eurovision and business rush to ditch links to Moscow over Ukraine invasion",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/football-eurovision-and-business-rush-to-ditch-links-to-moscow-over-ukraine-invasion
2/27/2022,"Manchester United’s inability to finish any of their countless chances was near-comedic and costly. Against a Watford side with one league win since November, Cristiano Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes were the chief culprits, each missing when it appeared easier to score. For Roy Hodgson’s team a point is welcome succour in their fight against relegation. For Ralf Rangnick’s side the draw is a deep frustration considering how dominant they were. Their unbeaten run stretches to 11 but this should have been a precious three points in the race for Champions League qualification. Ronaldo was first to be listed in the file marked ‘proflicagy’, pulling a trademark pout after he met Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s cross and saw the ball rebound off Ben Foster’s right post. Then, Fernandes had a shot blocked and Anthony Elanga, chosen ahead of Marcus Rashford, blasted a volley over. Fernandes erred again at the end of a slick move. Elanga received the ball from Nemanja Matic and fed Ronaldo whose backheel was taken again by the young Swede. He chose correctly – a pass to Fernandes - yet from close range the latter’s shot was too close to Foster. United were a red swarm over the Hornets. Alex Telles, preferred ahead of Luke Shaw, found Ronaldo to sweep home only for it be ruled out for offside. Watford could not get a grip on the contest and when Fernandes ghosted into the near post and connected with Paul Pogba’s delivery they should have fallen behind only for United’s captain to volley wide. The visitors main ploy was to break quickly and Joshua King, operating on the left of a front trident, raced in and took aim, his effort being repelled. It was the fleetest of respites. Ronaldo was as mobile as he has been since his return to Old Trafford and when Wan-Bissaka prodded the ball through the centre-forward rounded Foster and found the head of Fernandes who again spurned the opportunity. An alarm for Rangnick’s men came when Matic inadvertently passed to Ismaïla Sarr who recycled the ball to Emmanuel Dennis but when King was played in Victor Lindelöf stuck a boot out and United escaped. Before kick-off an apt note had been struck when Rangnick and his United players displayed a poster that read ‘peace’ in several languages, Watford joining them for a group photo, in what was an idea suggested by the German. After leaving out Harry Maguire, Shaw, Jadon Sancho and Rashford from Wednesday’s win at Atlético Madrid, Rangnick cited the reason being how this was a third game in six days: an interesting move given his side’s ongoing shakiness during the unbeaten run. Win and the 63-year-old would be vindicated but as the second half started the game remained goalless. Despite their dominance United were vulnerable and that was highlighted when David de Gea failed to come to collect a Tom Cleverley corner and was lucky to see the ball bounce away to safety. United’s response was a Matic chip to Pogba yet all he could engineer was a cross-shot hybrid that went wide. Watford were spirited and De Gea had to save a weak effort from Dennis. Elanga, impressive throughout, nearly broke the deadlock when he latched on to a sublime flick from Pogba but from close range his radar was awry. United continued to take turns to miss. Ronaldo was unable to beat Foster from yards out, before Elanga and Fernandes had the same problem. Sancho, a second half replacement, shaped inside and let fly. In added time, Sarr nearly performed a late smash-and-grab but his 30-yard shot sailed wide. When the final whistle went boos rang out: it spoke of the home supports ire and United’s toothlessness.",Sport/Football,Crowd vent frustration after wasteful Manchester United are held by Watford,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/26/manchester-united-watford-premier-league-match-report
2/27/2022,"This match will be remembered for what mattered the most: that Christian Eriksen returned, to the most rapturous of receptions, to competitive football and completed 38 accomplished minutes for Brentford as a substitute. It was goosebump-inducing to see Eriksen playing and there were plenty of suggestions he will improve Brentford. There were also huge warning signs that they will need him to, because this defeat against an accomplished Newcastle may have dire consequences for their season. The away side were helped significantly by Josh Dasilva’s early red card but capitalised admirably, scoring through Joelinton and Joe Willock before the interval and seeing things out calmly from there. They move four points clear of relegation but Brentford, with one win from their last eight, are careering towards it. The decision to send off Dasilva was made protractedly, and entirely correctly, with the use of VAR. It reversed a call that had originally gone Brentford’s way. Their fans were right to applaud when Yoane Wissa, a striker, chased back to take the ball off the toes of a poised Jonjo Shelvey; they were then relieved as, when the ball ran loose outside the box, Mike Dean awarded them a free-kick for Matt Targett’s challenge on Dasilva. As soon as slow-motion footage became available, though, it was clear that would not hold. The right wing-back Dasilva had tried to get across Targett and let the ball run beyond him but, leaping off the ground, had planted a high right foot on to his opponent’s lower leg. Targett required treatment and, in the meantime, Dean was readied for a journey to his pitchside monitor. The red card was delivered within seconds and Thomas Frank’s plans were ruined with 11 minutes played. Frank switched to a back four and for a time Brentford held their own. Their desire to ask questions with quick, direct balls was not obviously compromised and a couple of harmless Chris Wood headers were the closest thing to damage they sustained in the first 25 minutes. But a third effort from Wood, nodding Ryan Fraser’s cross downwards but seeing David Raya parry, served as a clear warning and prompted the pressure that brought Joelinton’s goal. Raya had just denied Targett when Fraser, a constant menace down the left, went to work again. This time it was Joelinton on the end of his chipped delivery and he thudded back across the keeper emphatically, running the length of the pitch to celebrate with Newcastle’s fans in the opposite corner. That already felt more than Brentford, looking bruised now, would be able to turn around and before half-time the game was effectively put beyond them. Raya had save from Fraser, grabbed yet another Wood header and watched a Shelvey piledriver whistle over, but a quick second goal came to seem a matter of time. The manner of its conception came as a surprise: Brentford had forced a corner but, when it was cleared high towards halfway, the centre-back Fabian Schär was Newcastle’s highest-placed player up the pitch. He took the ball from the sky, and beyond Rico Henry, with a masterfully controlled touch and earned himself a run towards goal. That precision was matched by his pass left to an open Willock, who capped a thrilling sequence of play with a whipped first-time finish above Raya. It would have been three but for a parry by Raya from Schär, who more familiarly found himself on the end of a set piece. There was no obvious way back for Brentford but Frank had one card up his sleeve and deployed it earlier than might have been anticipated. Eriksen’s introduction lifted the entire stadium and will have warmed the hearts of millions far beyond. The added note of poetry was that he replaced his Denmark teammate Mathias Jensen, who had taken his place when the Euro 2020 match against Finland was inexplicably allowed to continue after his cardiac arrest. His arrival raised the roof and visibly boosted Brentford’s belief. Within seconds Eriksen had attempted a clever through pass from the kind of pocket around the area in which they have lacked guile for much of the season; another Dane, Christian Nørgaard, soon curled just over and then Eriksen was greeted with an ovation when he went to take a corner in the left quadrant. It was enough to offer hope that, despite the futility of this particular afternoon’s cause, player and club will serve each other admirably. Eriksen tried to release Bryan Mbeumo from deep and the ball was only a shade too strong. The truth, though, was that Newcastle still looked more likely to score a third when they gathered themselves to spring upfield. The outstanding Raya made another virtuoso intervention against Targett and then drew applause with some neat footwork on the edge of the box. He completed his afternoon’s tasks by beating away Shelvey’s free-kick. Theconcern for Brentford is that there is even harder work to come.",Sport/Football,Christian Eriksen returns but Brentford slump at home to Newcastle,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/26/brentford-newcastle-premier-league-match-report
2/27/2022,"There are a few recordings of television interviews with Lena Zavaroni around online. One with Russell Harty where he comments that her eating disorder must save on restaurant bills and another when Terry Wogan tells her to eat up so she can get back to “your chunky self”. The little girl with the big voice was 10 when she appeared on Opportunity Knocks – television’s predecessor to Britain’s Got Talent and Pop Idol – singing Ma! He’s Making Eyes at Me, 11 when it was a hit and 13 when she was diagnosed with anorexia, a barely known illness then called the “slimmer’s disease”. Before she died in 1999 the girl from Rothesay on the Scottish island of Bute had hosted her own TV shows, performed at the White House and shared a stage with Barbra Streisand, Frank Sinatra and Lucille Ball. She remains the youngest artist ever to have a record in the Top 10 UK albums chart. Lena was huge. “With hindsight, now, I don’t think I’d let her do it,” says her father Victor Zavaroni, now 82, through whose eyes a new musical about Lena’s life has been written by Bafta and Olivier award-winner Tim Whitnall. “It was unbelievable, really, in those days,” adds Zavaroni. “In 1974, getting on the telly was a big thing. You’d look at that screen and Lena was there. You felt proud of her: ‘Oh God, is this happening to my wee lassie?’. You never thought ‘what comes next?’. You were in that moment – your daughter was enjoying doing what she loved. You never thought you weren’t going to see her so much. She was just a kiddie and I was young myself. “We never pushed her, her mum and me. She would just jump up and do her thing. She liked entertaining people. I don’t think Lena liked that Ma! He’s Making Eyes song, but they couldn’t find a song suitable for a kiddie that wasn’t a love song.” Zavaroni knew nothing about the complexities or workings of showbusiness, he says. “I signed a contract which I couldn’t have understood a word of. I said: ‘Is it OK if I show this to a lawyer?’ And they said: ‘Oh no. There will be no lawyers on the island who will understand this, and if you delay things you might miss out on this great step for your daughter.’ “Lena was nine. She was playing about with her sister on the floor at the time and she just said, ‘That’d be great, Dad.’ So I decided to sign it.” Before the likes of Britney Spears and Amy Winehouse struggled with the pressures of celebrity in the social media era, Lena, catapulted to stardom as a young girl with little control over her own money-making abilities and maturing in the limelight, suffered her own demons. “I just noticed her getting very thin and took her to the doctor,” says Zavaroni. “I know about anorexia now because I made it my business to, but then? You’d never heard the name. The doctor said: ‘Your daughter has this psychological illness.’ “She was at the Italia Conti [perfoming arts] school then and they were all on diets there. Girls are girls and don’t like to get too fat. We’re all like that – but then it just got extreme. It goes into the mind. Her not eating was a never-ending battle. It’s a very difficult illness for the person, and for the people round about them. “The only thing Lena ever complained about was her illness. It was a torment to her. She’d say: ‘It’s as if I’m living in a tunnel.’” Living with clinical depression and anorexia drove Lena, against her family’s wishes, to take the radical step of opting for a lobotomy, a controversial and rarely performed elective operation in which nerve pathways in the brain are severed. Weighing less than four stone, she died of pneumonia a month after the surgery, aged 35. Erin Armstrong, 26, who plays Lena in the new show, believes not enough lessons have been learned about the problems of celebrity. “We’re talking about things more and we are more aware of issues like anorexia, but has much changed really?”, she says. “For me there are a lot of similarities with the likes of Amy Winehouse and Caroline Flack – people who needed help in the face of all that media pressure. I had never heard of her [Lena] before but as soon as I looked her up the story was just so striking, so poignant and so many themes are relevant today. It’s a story that needs to be told.” For Lena writer Whitnall, it’s been a story he has wanted to tell for some time. “I remember going to school the day after Lena appeared on Opportunity Knocks. It was the talk of the school. Suddenly she was everywhere,” he says. “I genuinely hope a lot of younger people will see the show, because Lena was a poster girl, a pioneer – before Britain’s Got Talent or any of that she was doing that rags-to-riches story with raw talent. Shocking as it was to hear those clips with Lena being patronised over her anorexia, that is a tragedy that hasn’t gone away. Today some 725,000 young people are living with anorexia in the UK and there still isn’t a cure as such.” For Lena’s dad the memories are bittersweet. “You don’t expect your daughter to die before you,” he says. “She’s always in my mind. It does feel like a long time ago, but I have always got Lena in my mind. “It’s marvellous after all these years to have her remembered. I’m proud to have been Lena’s dad and I try to remember the happy times.” Lena is produced by Anna Murphy, Feather Productions in association with Beacon Arts Centre and is funded by Creative Scotland.

2/27/2022,"In September 1999, a month after Putin became PM, bomb explosions at apartment buildings in Moscow and two other cities killed over 300 people. Putin blamed Chechen separatists (who denied it). He ordered the air bombing of Grozny – the start of the second Chechen war. Alexander Litvinenko, the ex-FSB agent murdered in London in 2006, claimed the FSB planted the city bombs, with Putin’s connivance, to help bring him the presidency. That was motive enough for his poisoning. The war left up to 50,000 dead or missing, mostly civilians. As in the Donbas today, separatist forces in the breakaway Georgian regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia fought government forces in August 2008. When Georgia’s president, Mikheil Saakashvili, sent troops to restore order, Putin deployed Russian forces to support the separatists (which they had already been doing). A full-scale Russian invasion of undisputed Georgian territory ensued in what Putin called a “peace enforcement” operation. Again acting on the pretext of defending persecuted ethnic Russians, forces under Putin’s direction helped seize control of parts of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts in eastern Ukraine (part of the Donbas region) in 2014. The two separatist entities declared their independence this month. Putin also annexed Crimea. An estimated 14,000 people have died in fighting leading up to the current conflict. Barack Obama’s failure to intervene in Syria’s civil war after a chemical attack in Ghouta in 2013, which had breached the US president’s “red line”, left an opening for Putin. Intent on exploiting American weakness, bolstering his ally, Syria’s president, Bashar åal-Assad, and strengthening Russia’s strategic position in the Middle East, Putin deployed planes and special forces to Syria in 2015. They are still there. Russia now has a permanent naval base on the Mediterranean, at Tartus. In what now looks like a dress rehearsal for the Ukraine invasion, Putin sent troops to Kazakhstan, another former Soviet republic, in January. But rather than topple the incumbent regime, their mission was to help the country’s rulers suppress pro-democracy protests sparked by economic hardship and corruption. In familiar style, Putin again described the troops as “peacekeepers”. By his standards, the operation was relatively bloodless.",News/World news,Ukraine invasion: how Vladimir Putin built his career on waging war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-career-war-russian-president
2/27/2022,"When Yuliia Petrenko, a 31-year-old lawyer originally from Donetsk, arrived outside Downing Street for the Stand With Ukraine demonstration on Saturday, she started crying. “The first thing I saw was somebody’s little boy with a sign that said ‘Putin is killing my gran’, and I just burst into tears,” Petrenko said. Like many Ukrainians living in the UK, Petrenko has experienced a wave of emotions in recent days – fear, anger, frustration, powerlessness, guilt – as she talks to relatives at home experiencing the arrival of war. “At the minute, my auntie, my cousin and their puppy are in a shelter,” she told the Guardian at the rally. They fled the Donetsk region for Kyiv after Russia’s 2014 invasion. Now, war has followed them. “It just feels like you’re waiting to wake up from a nightmare,” Petrenko said. “They can’t believe what’s happening, they feel like sitting ducks.” Petrenko joined hundreds of people in London on Saturday demonstrating their support for Ukraine and revulsion at Russia’s invasion, as diverse crowds expressed their solidarity with Ukrainians and called on western leaders to take stronger action. “Stop Putin, stop the war!” crowds shouted outside the prime minister’s residence. In a separate demonstration eggs were thrown at the Russian embassy in Kensington in outrage at the military incursion that has already killed hundreds and turned a sovereign nation into a battleground. But there was a sense of hope at the rallies, Petrenko said, as a groundswell of people across the world stand up to demand their politicians act. “We want more sanctions, we want Swift [the international payments network] turned off, this pacifying approach does not work,” said Oksana Trofymuk, a 43-year-old from Ukraine who moved to the UK in 2000. “It’s just lots of talk, it’s pathetic. The system in place for security does not work – the world is not safe.” Trofymuk spoke to her family on Saturday morning. Her mum and brother are based in western Ukraine and are currently safe. “They’re in church right now, praying,” Trofymuk said. “I did tell her it’s not enough praying, you need to go and find out what you can do.” Russians living in the UK also turned out to send the message that President Vladimir Putin did not act in their name. “I’m here to support the Ukrainian people because I’m against this war,” Svetlana Woods, a 39-year-old from Siberia, said. “I can’t even imagine what they’re going through now.” “When I was a child one of my nightmares was Hitler invading Russia,” said Woods, who has two children aged four and two. “And I’m absolutely embarrassed to think kids from other countries fall asleep and in their nightmares Russia is attacking them.” Woods said friends and relatives back in Russia are “brainwashed” by state media and cannot accept Russia is the aggressor. She can’t go home, but said: “I’m not sure I want to go back to Russia at the moment.” “You’re ashamed to say you’re Russian,” she added. Kateryna O’Kill, a 42-year-old dentist who moved to the UK from Ukraine 20 years ago, said the demonstration was to “express ourselves peacefully [and] tell the world that the war has to stop”. She went on: “Putin, please stop the war. You have people in the Russian army who all have families and futures, why do they have to go and die, go and fight on Ukrainian land? “Boris Johnson, please introduce stronger sanctions, please do something to stop this craziness. We don’t need bloodshed on European territory.” As well as in London, demonstrations were held across the UK in cities including Manchester, Bristol and Edinburgh. The events join a long list of countries including Ireland, the US and Estonia where people took to the streets demanding an end to the invasion. The demonstrations also brought together people from a raft of other countries to express their solidarity with Ukraine. “We’re here in solidarity,” said Julia Britton, a 62-year-old charity chief executive from the UK. “We want Putin to stop and Boris to start.” Karol Karpinski, a 33-year-old from Poland, underscored the importance of stopping Putin now before he moves on to intimidate other European countries. “If Ukraine is made a Russian colony I would expect him to move on to Poland and the Baltic states,” he said. Likewise, Antanas Jocius, a 32-year-old from Lithuania, said: “We’ve been occupied by the Russians, they used force, they killed lots of Lithuanians … We know what’s going to happen if nobody’s going to stand up.”",News/World news,‘We want more sanctions’: Ukrainians rally in London and across UK,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/we-want-more-sanctions-ukrainians-rally-in-london-and-across-uk
2/27/2022,"She has always wanted this. Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Biden’s nominee to fill the supreme court seat left vacant by the retirement of Stephen Breyer at the end of this term, said that she wanted to become a judge one day in the yearbook from her Miami high school. By then she was already a champion in national oratory competitions, sharpening the skills of rhetoric and cadence that are the stock and trade of ambitious lawyers. Her parents – an attorney and a school principal – saw their daughter’s potential, and helped her to hoist herself from her middle-class origins onto the path followed by ambitious lawyers from more patrician backgrounds. She went to Harvard for undergrad and then to Harvard Law, eventually clerking on the court for Breyer himself – a justice known to be particularly picky with his clerkships. She seems to have pursued the law with single-minded devotion since she was very young, committing herself to the profession with all the passion and devotion of a vocation. But her legal career took her to places most supreme court justices’ careers have not: In addition to her standard bona fides in private practice and later on the federal bench, she served on the United States Sentencing Commission, working to assess federal criminal sentencing practices and advocating for reduced sentences for drug offenders. Later, she served as a federal public defender in Washington. This makes her the first former public defender nominated to the court, and the first since Thurgood Marshall with extensive criminal defense experience. Her nomination signals a respect for a field of legal practice with great moral authority but little respect from the legal establishment: advocating for the rights of criminal defendants and the poor. When Biden nominated Jackson to a seat on the DC circuit court just last summer, the post was widely seen as a stepping-stone to the supreme court itself: Jackson had already been all but anointed as Breyer’s successor. She sailed through that confirmation, even bagging three Republican votes. The ease of her last appointment, even amid the backdrop of her future one, suggested that Senate Republicans had not been able to manufacture controversy from her record, a failure on their part that suggests remarkable discipline on Jackson’s. She seems to have behaved in a manner becoming a federal judge her whole life. It’s as if she was born wearing a black robe. And yet for much of the nation’s history, Judge Jackson’s story would have been impossible. Jackson is the first Black woman to be nominated to the supreme court, fulfilling a Biden campaign promise, and she has made her way in a legal profession – and indeed, in a country – that is accustomed to discarding Black women’s talent. In many ways she represents America’s great, if usually thwarted, promise: that hard work by individuals, combined with a moral arc of national history that bends toward justice, can deliver talented and worthy people to success despite the injustices imposed on them for their race, their sex, or their origins. That there has never been a Black woman on the court before is testament to how rarely this promise is kept: Jackson is not the first Black female legal mind worthy of the court, and if she is confirmed, she will serve alongside more than one white man of lesser intellect and character. But though she is the first, she will not be the last. When Jackson joins the court, all of the Democratic appointees will be women. Two will be women of color. That gender disparity is likely to be especially stark in abortion and LGBT rights cases the coming years, as the conservative legal movement builds off its expected success in Dobbs v Jackson, the case that will overturn Roe v Wade this summer, and sets its sights undoing the privacy right that the court has used to protect sexual freedoms. Over its coming terms, the court – whose extreme right bent will not be changed by Jackson’s addition – is likely to approve further abortion bans and restrictions, cut off contraception access, and roll back marriage equality, trans rights, and the legality of gay sex. Dissenting will be three women who stand for the rights of Americans to live lives free of the notion that biology must be destiny, and unencumbered by sex role stereotypes. These women will stand for these freedoms, and others, while a majority of six conservative justices enshrine male supremacy and forced birth into federal law. Jackson’s opinions will likely be oriented more towards young lawyers and the general public than towards her conservative colleagues, who have shown themselves petulant and unwilling to engage in good faith with the arguments of the liberals. It is not an enviable task that Jackson will face on the court, but we can be grateful that she is willing to take it. Nor will her confirmation be easy. Though Jackson has long been the favorite to replace Breyer, in recent weeks a group of conservative Democrats, led by the influential congressman Jim Clyburn, made a concerted push to encourage Biden to nominate Judge Michelle Childs, a federal district court judge from South Carolina. Childs’ nomination would have been a favor to Clyburn, whose endorsement of Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential primary is widely credited with reviving Biden’s faltering campaign. But Childs had sparked weariness from the left for her past decisions regarding criminal sentencing and her private practice work on labor disputes. Perhaps it was this criticism that endeared her to Senate Republicans, who issues warm words about Childs and dangled a bipartisan confirmation vote in front of Biden. Now that their preferred candidate has been rejected in favor of one more amenable to progressives, conservatives have endeavored to paint Jackson has an extreme leftist. “If media reports are accurate, and Judge Jackson has been chosen as the supreme court nominee to replace Justice Breyer, it means the radical left has won President Biden over yet again,” tweeted Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican on the Senate judiciary committee who voted to confirm Judge Jackson to the DC circuit last summer. Jackson’s actual jurisprudence reflects scrupulousness more than radicality. While on the DC circuit this past year, Judge Jackson presided over a case called Committee on the Judiciary v McGahn, a lawsuit concerning the Trump administration’s attempt to sabotage a congressional investigation. It’s the kind of case that ambitious judges pray to avoid: high-profile and politically charged, with one party that would declare any unfavorable outcome a process violation. Knowing she was under a microscope, Jackson delivered a measured, thorough, and lengthy ruling declaring that former White House counsel Don McGahn could be compelled to testify before Congress. It was the kind of point-by-point argument meant to be ironclad even to the least sympathetic of readers.

2/27/2022,"Death by Conspiracy? (BBC Radio 4) | BBC Sounds Science Vs: Joe Rogan: The Malone Interview | Gimlet Media Mission Transmission | FunKids An interesting new series from the BBC disinformation reporter Marianna Spring (is it me or does her job title sound as though Spring is dishing out the disinformation rather than investigating it?), Death By Conspiracy?, a 10-part series of 15-minute episodes going out bit by bit on Radio 4 but all available on BBC Sounds, looks at the death of Gary Matthews in Shrewsbury in January 2021. A healthy 46-year-old, Matthews died, alone, at home, of Covid. A terrible event, as all Covid deaths have been. But this one perhaps seems more terrible because there is a sense that it might easily have been avoided. Matthews, who was close to his family and had many good friends, had gradually been drawn into an anti-establishment community that didn’t believe Covid exists. Because of this, he didn’t wear a mask, and joined several crowded protests against mandatory vaccine passports. And when he got Covid, he didn’t seek medical help. It’s tempting, when you hear the circumstances around Matthews’s death, to create a conclusive equation. You know: lonely bloke plus friendly conspiracy theorists plus rampant epidemic equals death. Spring, to her credit, does not do that. Instead, she talks to members of his family, to his friends, to Shrewsbury locals. And to one person in particular, Charlie Parker, a conspiracy theorist who was friendly with Matthews and who believed – and still does – that Covid isn’t real and that “they” are covering up the real circumstances of Matthews’s death. Whoever “they” are. The admirably dogged and fair Spring talks to Parker on a number of occasions over the series, and each time he won’t shift. Some people will never change their mind. I know several people who won’t get the vaccine, who are suspicious of mask mandates and lockdowns, who believe that powerful people are manipulating us all for their own dark ends. I’ve argued with some, but not all. We all decide how to live our lives. More power to Spring for her truthful, empathetic reporting and for creating such an interesting series. More dismantling of disinformation on the popular podcast Science Vs. Its most recent episode is devoted to challenging the “points” made by Dr Robert Malone about Covid and vaccines on Joe Rogan’s podcast The Joe Rogan Experience. Here’s the backstory: Rogan has the most listened-to podcast in the world; Spotify paid at least $100m for exclusive rights to it; Rogan and his bro-interviewees have been offensive about women and non-white people (he’s used the N-word in the past); in December, he interviewed Malone, who said that Covid vaccines have terrible side effects and could even increase your chance of getting Covid. As a result of this episode of Rogan’s podcast, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, India Arie and others have pulled their music from Spotify. The twist to the Science Vs Malone-busting episode is that Science Vs also has an exclusive deal with Spotify. So, the show has skin in the game, and making this episode is a useful and brave move. Wendy Zukerman, a rambunctious Aussie, knows her science, as does her co-host for this episode, producer Rose Rimler. They work their way through the Rogan episode, calling out Malone’s obfuscatory methods. Essentially, he cherrypicks data and tells anecdotes that don’t illustrate a larger point (he claimed that the vaccine caused his aorta to nearly collapse and he could have died). Plus, he deliberately doesn’t include the benefits of the vaccine. “It’s like they’re making a pro/con list and they’re just writing stuff in the con side,” says Rimler. Zukerman and Rimler are diligent about the science, whether it supports Malone or not. They find out, for example, that the vaccine can affect menstrual cycles, but only by around a day and then everything returns to normal after a couple of months. They do not cherrypick. And they have decided not to make any more Spotify-only Science Vs episodes, except those designed to counter scientific misinformation, until Spotify improves its policies. Again: more power to them. More science – but of the far jollier kind – in FunKids’s fantastically sweet project to broadcast a radio show into space. After inviting its listeners to send in voice notes answering a few questions, the station made a half-hour programme from their contributions and beamed it out from the Royal Observatory in Greenwich last Monday at 7pm. As the first ever radio show to go into deep space, it set a new Guinness world record. As a listen, it might not change your life, but the contributions are wonderfully optimistic (“Hello aliens!”). Plus, there was a whole afternoon chatting space (FunKids is great for science), and everyone on the show – child and adult alike – has a real respect for proved facts.

2/27/2022,"Russia’s attack on Ukraine poses a dilemma for the UK government and the Bank of England with an obvious answer. The dilemma centres on the cost of living crisis, which is only going to worsen now that gas prices are on course to rocket again and oil prices along with them. Within seconds of the first reports from Ukraine of the invasion, traders were hiking the cost of gas back towards levels seen in December last year. That was the month prices reached nine times the five-year average, before falling back to five times the average in January. Analysts have warned that household gas and electricity bills could rise by a further £600-£1,000 a year – to as much as £3,000 – if wholesale gas prices are kept high by an ongoing war. Petrol prices, which in January appeared to have passed their peak when they began falling towards £1.40 a litre, are heading back to record highs of £1.50 and beyond. In some parts of the country, they have already exceeded £1.60 a litre. A surge in energy costs has put inflation on track to hit 7% or 8% by the spring, and possibly higher in the summer, eating into the disposable incomes of middle earners and pushing many of those on low wages into poverty. The combined effect on the bottom two-thirds of households will be to slow the economy, which has come to depend to a disturbingly high degree, during a decade or more of public spending cuts, on consumer spending. Rishi Sunak is planning to make the cost of living crisis worse by increasing taxes – national insurance will rise by 1.25% in April and income tax will rise via a freeze on thresholds, bringing more people into paying tax at the standard rate and more people paying higher-rate tax. The Bank of England has its own scheme to increase the costs of borrowing for tens of thousands of small and medium-sized business, and millions of mortgage payers, who face higher-cost loans in the near future if not straight away. Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, financial markets were expecting interest rates to rise by at least one percentage point this year. Some City economists believed Threadneedle Street was on course to increase the base rate to 2% by the middle of next year. With inflation soaring, taxes rising and interest rates climbing higher, no wonder the GfK consumer confidence index for February slumped to -26. This was its lowest level since February last year and not far from its worst ever level of -34 when the pandemic took hold in April and May 2020. In February 2020 it stood at -7. It’s true that plenty of people are plotting how to fly on holiday to spend their pandemic savings, but they are in a minority, albeit a large one. Most people are reeling from forecasts from their energy suppliers of an extra £700, £800 or £900 on their energy bills this year, made before the war began. Should the Bank of England press ahead with interest rate rises to quell even higher inflation? Should Sunak shoot holes in everyone’s take-home pay in April to rebuild the public finances? The answers must be no and no. Even staff at the International Monetary Fund, who gave their verdict on the UK economy last week and are not known for any socialist tendencies, said the tax burden should shift to higher earners to allow the Treasury to offer more support for those on middle and low incomes. The Washington-based lender of last resort, which this week will be confronted by a separate dilemma when it considers a request from Ukraine’s government for financial assistance, knows it would be foolish for British ministers to plough on when, without offering extra financial support to the worst hit, the energy crisis could push the economy into recession. As for the Bank of England, it will need to let inflation rise without increasing interest rates, knowing that the likelihood of a huge squeeze on living standards will on its own bring down demand and reduce pressure on prices. It will be difficult for the anti-inflation warriors inside Threadneedle Street to leave prices to rise and fall without taking action, but extra borrowing costs in the current environment, coupled with tumbling consumer spending, would make a recession next year almost certain. It may seem callous to debate the economic situation in the UK when soldiers and civilians are dying. But it won’t help the people of Ukraine if British policymakers, along with their blinkered counterparts in the US and EU, drive the west into recession. Thankfully, there is every prospect that the US Federal Reserve will resist pushing interest rates higher at its next meeting, and the Bank should follow suit. It would send a positive signal: that at least the central banks understand.",News/Business,"In the face of war, central bank hawks must retreat on inflation",https://www.theguardian.com/business/commentisfree/2022/feb/26/in-the-face-of-war-central-bank-hawks-must-retreat-on-inflation
2/27/2022,"It’s often said that debates on transgender issues are polarised and intolerant to a degree that helps no one. Last week, in a Westminster Hall debate on reform of the Gender Recognition Act, the Scottish National MP Mhairi Black showed how it could and should be done. At stake were the difficulties trans people have in getting their identities legally recognised. With this issue come the fears raised by those who oppose simplifying these processes, that dangers to women would arise as a result of people born with male bodies being able to enter lavatories, changing rooms and other single-sex spaces. Black’s support for reform was clear. The current process, she said, “is deeply invasive, traumatising, unnecessary and dehumanising”, while arguing out that possession of a gender recognition certificate, the end point of it all, is actually irrelevant to access to single-space spaces. “I am a woman,” she said, and “I don’t feel threatened. If anything, the thing that makes me feel most threatened is quite often the very aggressive and often male anonymous accounts that proclaim to be defending me from something.” Trenchant though she was, she didn’t seek to diminish her opponents. “I don’t doubt that there are legitimate concerns,” she said, “but the answers are also out there.” Whether or not you agree, her words demanded that you engage with the substance of her arguments, not at the level of a Twitter spat. Black first made the news in 2015, when she was elected to parliament at the age of 20. Now 27, she continues to show a degree of maturity beyond many of her elders. St John’s House, a project billed as the UK’s “largest new home for over a hundred years”, has been proposed for a site near Chipping Norton in the Cotswolds. Its floor area of 6,692 square metres would, according to space standards set out by the mayor of London, be enough to make 111 two-bedroom flats. It is a vast cliff of masonry designed by the Winchester-based practice of Adam Architecture, an inverted quarry in a classical style. It is garnished, according to the official computerised images, with a landscape of pink-blossoming blobs, which is their primitive conception of trees. The project is not quite Putinesque, in that the Russian dictator might want this much space just to store his ice-hockey gear, but it does go to show that an eyesore is an eyesore in any style, classical or modern. It also raises the question: why? What could any person who is not deranged want to do with all this volume? If you are that person, apply to Sotheby’s International Realty, which will happily sell you the site. In 1997, flush with victory, Tony Blair’s government had a decision to make. Should they proceed with a Tory plan to commemorate the coming millennium with a large dome on the Greenwich peninsula in London? They did, rebranding it as a triumph of New Labour optimism, on one condition: the roof covering proposed for the structure, which had been decried by Greenpeace for its short life expectancy, would be replaced by one lasting 25 years. Recently, Storm Eunice, like a toddler ripping at wrapping paper, shredded that same covering, on what is now called the O2. It’s not quite a quarter-century since the material was installed in 1998, but by the standards of promises about timing, in both politics and construction, you can only be impressed by the precision with which the one about its lifespan has been kept.

2/27/2022,"This week the government announced additional vaccine booster jabs for the over-75s and suggested a further shot is likely to be needed in the autumn. But imagine if the next Covid vaccine jab you have were the last you would ever need. That’s a dream being actively pursued now by researchers, who feel it could be possible to make a “universal” vaccine against the Sars-CoV-2 virus that would work well not only against all existing variants but any that the virus could plausibly mutate into in the future. Some are thinking even bigger. In January, Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, Anthony Fauci, and two other experts called for more research into “universal coronavirus vaccines” that would work not only against Sars-CoV-2 but against the many other coronaviruses in animal populations that have the potential to spill over into humans and cause future pandemics. “We need a research approach that can characterise the global ‘coronaviral universe’ in multiple species,” Fauci and colleagues wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine, “and apply this information in developing broadly protective ‘universal’ vaccines against all [coronaviruses].” Is that just a fantasy? Not necessarily. After all, many considered it fanciful, when the pandemic began, that we’d have a vaccine against Covid-19 in less than a year. But experience has proved that “we as a research community can pull together and do remarkable things,” says Larry Corey, a virologist and vaccine expert at the University of Washington in Seattle. The current vaccines were developed against the original “ancestral” variant of Sars-CoV-2. They still work remarkably well against the new variants in preventing severe disease – Corey says that even against Delta there seems to be about a 90-fold difference in the death rate between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. But the Omicron variant has caused alarm by its ability to transmit faster than the others and to infect vaccinated people. Although very few such individuals develop serious symptoms from Omicron, it can actively suppress the immune defences that vaccination (as well as natural infection) activate. Variants acquire changes to the chemical structure of the viral proteins, through random mutations when the virus replicates, that give them some competitive advantage – improved transmissibility, say. Many of these changes happen on the so-called spike protein, which sticks out of the virus shell and latches on to proteins in the membranes of human cells, creating a point of attachment and attack. Omicron has an alarming number of such mutations, showing how much capacity Sars-CoV-2 has to spring surprises. One answer is to adapt the vaccines to the variants. The mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna contain RNA molecules that act as templates for our cells to make harmless fragments of the spike protein. This is the vaccine’s antigen, provoking the immune system to find antibody molecules that will recognise the viral protein and mobilise immune cells against it. Then if the actual virus gets into our bodies, our immune system is primed to identify and destroy it. Other vaccines, such as AstraZeneca’s, use other methods to elicit the same immune priming. If the spike protein of a variant has a slightly different structure, in principle we can change the RNA molecule to one that encodes part of this new protein. If, as widely expected, Sars-CoV-2 eventually becomes endemic in the population, constantly circulating at a low level like flu and cold viruses but with the potential to produce an epidemic outbreak, the vaccines could be tailored to whatever variants are currently in circulation. This is more or less what happens with flu: each season’s flu vaccine is based on a best guess of what that season’s strains are likely to be. That’s all very well – except that Omicron has shown how rapidly a significantly new variant of the coronavirus can appear and spread globally. Pfizer and Moderna are now working on a vaccine tailored to Omicron. But even if this can be made and tested within a few months, that may be too late. So a universal vaccine that can protect against all variants could be preferable. “We need a vaccine that has potential to protect broadly and proactively against multiple coronavirus species and strains,” says Kayvon Modjarrad, who leads a team seeking to develop one at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, Maryland. At the moment we have no pan-variant vaccine for any endemic virus. Researchers have long dreamed of a universal vaccine that would make flu epidemics less lethal, and there are now promising signs that it could be possible. The design principle for a universal Covid vaccine would follow similar lines. One option might be to prime the immune system to recognise not just one bit of a viral protein, but lots of bits – not all of which are likely to change (or change significantly) at once in any new variant. We’d give the immune system many different ways to spot, and then suppress, the invader, in the hope that one will work. This might involve, for example, making an mRNA vaccine that contains many different RNA molecules, each encoding as a different protein fragment. Or a single particle in the vaccine could hold several different fragments. Alternatively, you can look for parts of the virus that seem to be “conserved” across variants: proteins (or bits of them) that don’t mutate much at all, presumably because such changes would be too detrimental to the virus. But how can you know what those will be, even for variants that haven’t emerged yet? One way is to see if highly conserved protein regions exist already among a whole family of related coronaviruses. “If you can find things that are in common between Sars-CoV-2, Sars [the related respiratory virus that caused alarm in 2003], and a bunch of other animal coronaviruses, then the likelihood is that the next variant of Sars-CoV-2 will have them too,” says Skip Virgin, chief scientific officer of San Francisco-based Vir Biotechnologies, which is working with GlaxoSmithKline on vaccine development – a collaboration that has already produced the monoclonal antibody sotrovimab for alleviating Covid symptoms. At the moment, researchers are mostly striving for the relatively modest target of hitting just a subset of the coronavirus universe: typically, to stimulate an immune response against a part of the spike protein, called the receptor binding domain (RBD), shared by Sars, Sars-CoV-2 and closely related bat coronaviruses. The RBD is the part of the spike protein that latches on to the host cells. Although some of the variants have small mutations in their RBD, its chemical structure doesn’t change much: create a strong immune response to the RBD and it should work against any virus in this family. Modjarrad’s team began Phase I clinical trials (looking just at the safety) of their pan-variant vaccine in April 2021. It uses a tiny nanoparticle called ferritin – a natural protein that stores iron atoms in the body – studded with many copies of the Sars-CoV-2 RBD. It has been long known that many copies of an antigen in a single vaccine particle elicit a stronger immune response than a single copy does. The institute is cagey about releasing details of its progress until its clinical trial data has been published. In December, however, the team published results showing that their ferritin vaccine confers good protection in macaques not only against the ancestral form of Sars-CoV-2 but also against the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants, and the original Sars virus. Barton Haynes of the Duke University School of Medicine in North Carolina is taking a similar approach with RBD-studded ferritin-based nanoparticles. Last May he and his coworkers reported a candidate vaccine that protected macaques against Sars-CoV-2, Sars, and some Sars-like bat coronaviruses. Very recently they showed that it generates a good immune response against the Delta and Omicron variants too. Haynes says they hope to start human clinical trials at the end of 2022. If they work out, he thinks that it might take a year or two before the vaccine is ready to use, depending on whether it’s deemed different enough from those we have already to warrant another large-scale Phase III clinical trial before being approved. These efforts might yield a vaccine resistant to all SARS-CoV-2 variants – but in principle such approaches might have an even wider scope, offering the universal coronavirus vaccines that Fauci and colleagues have called for. Haynes says that would probably entail finding the crucial RBDs for other families and adding those on to the particles too. That’s the beauty of the nanoparticle approach: it can readily incorporate a variety of protein fragments into a so-called multivalent vaccine. Finding the right protein fragments could mean combing through the thousands of coronaviruses known to infect wild animals such as bats, civet cats and raccoon dogs, as well as the four coronaviruses already endemic in human populations and which cause mild cold-like respiratory symptoms. It would be a huge task. But now we know the awful dangers such coronaviruses (which include those that caused outbreaks of Sars in 2003 and Mers in 2012) pose, the investment would be cheap compared with the economic and social harm it might prevent. Haynes hopes it might ultimately be possible for a single jab to protect against all coronaviruses for five to 10 years. Of course, no one can be sure what the fiendishly ingenious Covid-19 virus has in store for the future. “The first axiom of infectious disease is, never underestimate your pathogen,” says Corey. “The rapidity with which we’ve got four major variants in two and a half years is unprecedented and surprising. One wouldn’t bet against this virus.” But even viruses have limits. For example, despite Omicron’s extensive set of mutations, Vir’s sotrovimab still works against it. “Viruses can change some things but have a really hard time changing others,” says Virgin. “There are some things a virus just can’t get away with changing.” If you can find them, you’re in business. “I am optimistic that we can generate a vaccine that will give truly broad protection,” he says. Even the current vaccines still do well at preventing deaths, and we’re building up an arsenal of antivirals and other treatments too. What might be more important now, Corey says, is a vaccine that does better against all variants at blocking transmission. Even when death rates are reduced, “we are seeing the fabric of our lives, our travel, the things that make modern culture, be interfered with enormously,” he says. So we need second-generation vaccines that can prevent widespread infection – a goal that Corey says is widely regarded as tougher, and which would be hard to assess until they are rolled out. It’s tempting to think that we need to solve this pandemic before preparing for the next one, says Virgin, but “there’s absolutely no reason that your pandemic response can’t prepare you for the next”. And after all, he adds, it’s easier to persuade governments to spend on solving an existing problem than on one that hasn’t happened yet. “We really want to get to the point where we’re preventing the next pandemic, not responding to it,” says Neil King of the University of Washington in Seattle, who is also developing a universal nanoparticle-based coronavirus vaccine. “The only way to do that is through broadly protective vaccines.” How marvellous it would be if, in developing a variant-proof Covid vaccine, we end up with one that can avoid the next pandemic too.",News/Society,"Will we get a single, variant-proof vaccine for Covid?",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/26/will-we-get-a-single-variant-proof-vaccine-for-covid
2/27/2022,"Ukraine is increasing pressure on Turkey to ban Russian warships from the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits, after a tweet from President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on what he described as an “extremely important” closure. I thank my friend Mr. President of 🇹🇷 @RTErdogan and the people of 🇹🇷 for their strong support. The ban on the passage of 🇷🇺 warships to the Black Sea and significant military and humanitarian support for 🇺🇦 are extremely important today. The people of 🇺🇦 will never forget that! Turkey has so far made no public statements on closing the straits to Russian warships, although President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan spoke with Zelenskiy by phone earlier on Saturday, stating that Ankara is attempting to push for an immediate ceasefire. Turkish officials have briefed no decision has been taken and the Russian news agency Interfax reported that Russia has received no official notification from the Turkish side about a closure. Cutting off the Bosphorus and Dardanelles to Russian warships, preventing them from accessing the Black Sea, would be a significant move, not only in terms of cutting off long-term Russian support to its troops in Ukraine but also as a significant show of support to Ukraine. A ban would prevent Russian warships normally permanently stationed around the world from sailing into the Black Sea to assist troops in Ukraine. However, Turkey is unable to prevent ships permanently stationed in the Black Sea from returning to their bases. Shipping industry experts Lloyd’s List on Friday pointed out that commercial traffic through the Bosphorus has already slowed significantly in the past two days. Black sea shipping appears to have ground to a halt this morning. Nothing is moving off Ukraine. Odessa exodus for international vessels is largely complete however 13 vessels remain in port. 6 non-Ukrainian vessels appear to be sheltering offshore but not moving. @LLIntelligence pic.twitter.com/GQ5bgCBYdt Turkey’s foreign ministry described the Russian invasion as “unacceptable” but described it as a “military operation” rather than a war, as doing so has implications for the Montreux convention. The convention defines Turkish control of the straits as well as setting limits on the size, tonnage and duration of warships that can cross the straits, although warships belonging to countries bordering the Black Sea are normally able to pass unrestricted. Foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu on Friday laid out Turkey’s position regarding the closure of the straits to the daily newspaper Hürriyet, stating that officials are discussing whether the conflict meets the definition of a war under the Montreux convention. If officials decide that the definition has been met, this allows them to block warships from both Ukraine and Russia from passing through the straits, although the move is likely to be far more significant for the Russian side. “Turkey can stop the passage of warships through the straits,” he said, adding that the convention stipulates that “if there is a demand for ships from the warring countries to return to their bases, then it must be allowed”. “If we accept the state of war legally, this process will begin,” he added. “Secondly, if we accept the state of war we will prohibit the passage of warships... but even if we ban them, the Russians have such a right.” Turkey maintains alliances with both Russia and Ukraine, and has so far emphasised its neutrality in the conflict despite selling its Bayraktar TB2 drones to Ukraine and condemning Russia’s actions. Turkey’s own Nato membership was put under pressure by its decision to buy Russia’s S400 missile defence system in 2017, although Erdoğan has recently sought to show how much Turkey values membership of the organisation, telling journalists that “Nato should have taken a more decisive step”. The conflict in Ukraine and a rebuke from Russia should Turkey choose to close the straits is likely to heavily affect Turkey’s economy, already hobbled from a year where the lira lost half of its value and as rising energy costs spark protests and discontent. Turkey imports roughly a third of its natural gas supply from Russia, as well as much of its wheat from Russia and Ukraine.",News/World news,Kyiv piles pressure on Ankara to close straits to Russia’s warships,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/kyiv-piles-pressure-on-ankara-to-close-straits-to-russia-warships-ukraine
