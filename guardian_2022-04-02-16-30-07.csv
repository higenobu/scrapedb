4/2/2022,"Refugee advocates have celebrated the release of at least 18 people from onshore detention centres in Australia, but say the secrecy and lack of notice around their release is a final piece of cruelty from the Australian government. They have also called for the release of the 33 people who remain in detention. Ten refugees from the Park hotel in Melbourne received less than an hour’s notice to pack their bags before their release late on Friday. Other refugees were released from the Melbourne Immigration Transit Accommodation, Brisbane Immigration Transit Authority and Villawood Immigration Transit Accommodation in Sydney. The Department of Home Affairs made no announcement about their release and would not confirm numbers when asked by Guardian Australia on Saturday. It was the second time in three weeks that the department had released refugees from detention late on a Friday, after 13 people were released last month. The department said some refugees would be issued with bridging visas to allow them to reside in the community while awaiting departure to another country. They would not be allowed to settle in Australia, the department said. Some of those released are on track to leave for the US or Canada. Others are expected to go to New Zealand, but have not received confirmation. They are from four different countries – Iran, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sudan – and represented by seven different lawyers. There was no common thread between the cases, said Jana Favero from the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, which made it even more difficult for the 30-odd people left behind. “The only consistency is inconsistency,” she said. “There’s no common thread, which just adds to the cruelty and impacts the mental health of those left behind. There’s no rhyme or reason and believe me we have tried to find it.” All of those released had been in detention for eight to nine years, in both offshore and onshore detention. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Thanush Selvarasa, a human rights activist and refugee who was detained on Manus Island and in Melbourne before being released last January, said while their long-awaited release was welcome, after nine years the refugees were “destroyed mentally and physically”. “We need time to recover our lives and without a permanent protection visa we cannot recover our lives,” he said. “Thanks for all those people who are continually working for freedom. The people in detention should be released and detention should be ended. You cannot imagine being held for no reason.” Favero said the decision to release people late on a Friday night made it difficult for refugee services to provide immediate support to those now in the community, and mental health support to those who remained behind.

She suggested the government was keen to release people before the federal election, when it would be facing challenges in a number of seats from independents who were calling for a more humane treatment of refugees. “It really appears that they are happy to use people seeking asylum and refugees as political pawns,” she said. “They will detain them if they think that is politically advantageous, and they will release them if they are trying to gain ground in small-L Liberal seats.”",News/Australia news,More refugees released from detention ahead of Australian election,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/02/more-refugees-released-from-detention-ahead-of-australian-election
4/2/2022,"“Pipes. You need them. I got them right here.” The words, there, of Hassan al-Thawadi, secretary general of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy Qatar 2022, speaking in Doha on Thursday morning. Actually that’s not correct. In fact this is a line spoken by an unnamed door‑to‑door crack cocaine salesman in the TV series The Wire, during a sequence where the Baltimore police department experiments by decriminalising drugs in an abandoned neighbourhood. Addictions reach desperation level. The city’s dealers create their own vision of entrepreneurial hell. And everyone gets a lesson in life-or-death commodity capitalism. Thawadi didn’t say anything about pipes. Instead, responding to some fairly mild expressions of concerns over LGBTQ+ rights from Gareth Southgate, he said: “Somebody with a lot of influence like Southgate, somebody with a big audience that listens to what he says has got to choose his words very carefully.” Thawadi went on to imply Southgate was ignorant and that he had failed to investigate properly the issues raised. And the message was clear enough. The secretary general of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, who has spent a very long time listening politely to this stuff, and being emollient and conciliatory, isn’t going to take it any more. Later that day Thawadi told the president of the Norwegian Football Federation, Lise Klaveness, that she needed to “educate” herself before presuming to express moral qualms about a World Cup procured via a Fifa committee riddled with corrupt individuals. Not to mention staged in a nation where, frankly, Klaveness would be ineligible to be president of anything because she is gay, and therefore a member of a criminalised class. So yeah. Education. Stay classy guys. But one thing does seem clear as Qatar 2022 enters its extended countdown. There has been a change in the ambient mood music. Qatar is done with saying sorry. It has instead gone a little more alpha, flaring its neck muscles, snapping its towel across those gleaming new-build stadiums. It isn’t hard to see why this is happening. And why it is probably also a good thing, or at least a little closer to the truth of this whole extraordinary episode. Why the shift of tone? Basically, Qatar is having an absolute moment. The stars have aligned. The World Cup is all packaged up. Gas prices have spiked. War in Europe is bringing daily pilgrims doffing their caps and wringing their hands over petroleum prices. Only last November Boris Johnson was sidling up to Amir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani at the UN general assembly urging Qatar to do us a solid by becoming the UK’s “gas supplier of last resort”, which has a scary ring right now. This is giddy stuff. Boycott? Protests? Get real. You’re all coming. And none of you are going say a word. OK, apart from you, Norway, with your carbon riches, your energy sufficiency. The rest of you, just keep eyes fixed on that sweet 200-year natural gas reserve. Take a hit. Suck it down. Pipes. You need them, we got them right here. In this sense things have at least clarified a little. For those of us lost in the noise and colour it has been a bit like staring at a magic eye picture of history. It made no sense at all in Zurich in 2010. But fast forward to the current geopolitical map and it looks entirely logical. Of course, Qatar is staging the World Cup. Historians charting the events of our anxiety-ridden age will be able to use these twin World Cups, Russia-Qatar, as a neat practical example of the way oil and gas have driven power, conflict and wealth around the world; the way sport has been not only a metaphor for this, but an active and willing part of the process. Oil built the past two World Cups. Oil just won the Champions League. Oil has a lease on the Premier League title. They should probably just go ahead and fill the World Cup ball with natural gas, stick the winning team up on podium with an oversized camping cylinder they can light up like a Bunsen burner. And so it probably is a good thing if Qatar decides to be bit more frank about all this. Most obviously because we are all complicit. Until we kick this addiction, until gas and oil can be dialled back or replaced, we are all bound up in the process, from uneasy consumers, to the strange double life of our politicians pawing about for a deal, a handshake, a tanker route. Right up to the flaring hypocrisies of David Beckham, white knight of England’s own World Cup bid and generally sympathetic to things like inclusion and liberal values which are so hot right now; but seduced also by the lure of Qatari money, and transformed into a ludicrous popinjay by his own £150m deal to help pretend this World Cup is just about cool hotels and nice stadiums. But hey, Becks is only human. And in the end this is all a balance of those human needs. People close to the process have suggested for some time that the real reason Qatar wanted the World Cup in the first place is security. The morality stuff, the endless circular conversation about worker rights is a necessary soundtrack. But Qatar has one of the highest GDPs per capita in the world. Why would it care, really, what a small section of the liberal west thinks about aspects of its culture? In reality this has been about concerns that seem more a lot more real right now. Qatar wants to be known. Qatar doesn’t want to be part of the mainstream. Qatar doesn’t want its neighbours marching over the border while the world tries to find it on the map. That goal has been attained and gloriously so. From here on in Qatar no longer has to make nice. The rest of us, well, we’re free to watch.",Sport/Football,Why Qatar is done with saying sorry for human rights and equality issues | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/02/why-qatar-is-done-with-saying-sorry-for-human-rights-and-equality-issues
4/2/2022,"One of English rugby’s hottest title race for years reaches the most tepid of endings today. After weeks of back and forth with their rivals, Ealing began the weekend knowing that victory over Richmond would crown them champions of the Championship, regardless of Doncaster’s result on Friday night. Come Monday morning, however, there will be a sense of limbo irrespective of outcomes on the pitch. The Rugby Football Union ruled last month that Ealing and Doncaster – the only two clubs to apply to be eligible for promotion – had failed the minimum standards criteria. That criteria is agreed by the Professional Game Board, where the Championship clubs are represented, along with the RFU and Premiership clubs. The main sticking point is stadium capacity which, according to the MSC, must be 10,001 – neither Ealing nor Doncaster come particularly close but as the RFU acknowledged recently, the minimum for Premier League football grounds is 5,000 and both aspiring clubs could meet that. Premiership Rugby insists that stadium size is only one of a number of issues. PRL has lofty ambitions to revamp the league and move closer to the NFL model and, although there is a willingness to admit a 14th team, this will be only when they are oven-ready. The idea that an aspiring Championship club may be allowed to develop in the Premiership, having earned the right to be there, is anathema to the top-flight clubs whose ambitions sound a lot like a move to a franchise system. Should the promoted club be willing to pay north of £20m for a slice of P shares – currently split between the 13 clubs – it may be a different story but the message seems clear that second tier clubs wanting to chance their arm in the Premiership are not welcome. Herein lies the rub because as much as the RFU would admit the gap between the Premiership is cavernous and only going to get wider, the union cannot currently countenance allowing the top flight to be a permanently closed shop. First, the council would have to agree and members would be reluctant to sign off on it given the uproar it would cause at grassroots level. Second, political context is required because the fact that the RFU must approve structural changes is the single biggest bargaining chip the union has with the Premiership clubs and the Professional Game Agreement – the deal that governs the release of England players – is up for renewal in 2024. All of which leaves us in a temporary muddle. A moratorium on relegation was introduced last season and the plan was for the winners of this season’s Championship to go up into a 14-team Premiership. The 2022-23 season would see no relegation or promotion – giving Ealing or Doncaster a season’s grace – before a play-off between the bottom team in the Premiership and the winners of the Championship was introduced the following season. All well and good until the RFU ruled that Ealing and Doncaster had failed the criteria. Both sides have expressed their intentions to appeal against the decision but the RFU is not due to rule definitively until late April, maybe even early May. That means about a month for the Championship winners unable to plan for next season properly, unable to recruit with any certainty. These clubs have already been operating with one hand tied behind their back and it is to the immense credit of all Championship teams that they remain afloat after the devastating combination of swingeing funding cuts by the RFU and the Covid-19 pandemic. The precedent for the appeals process is London Welsh, who were ultimately successful after scrambling to arrange a groundshare with Oxford United at the Kassam stadium in 2012. It was an unmitigated disaster, playing home matches 50 miles away from their Richmond home, so it sticks in the craw to hear the RFU ask why Ealing and Doncaster did not arrange groundshares. It was reported this week that Doncaster had belatedly lined up Hull KR’s Craven Park for their appeal but it is understood Ealing have not sought a groundshare. A year ago they had a deal with Saracens to use the StoneX Stadium if they won the Championship play-off but even then they failed the MSC on the basis it was not signed. This time, Ealing had proposed a year-three plan to bring their current home, Vallis Way, up to 10,000 capacity. They would argue that the MSC encourages sustainability and their proposal can achieve that whereas a groundshare would be loss-making. Furthermore, suspicion abounds and there is a sense that the Premiership clubs were perhaps not ready to cut their RFU funding 14 ways just yet. That the RFU chief executive Bill Sweeney recently hinted that the minimum stadium capacity could come down to 5,000, but next year not this, only adds to it. All the while the RFU works on plans for a hybrid cup competition between Premiership second teams and Championship clubs for the 2023-24 season. If some clubs do not feel they have the squad depth to enter into it, Premiership clubs could combine with Championship teams to enter. It is understood that if it is successful it could replace the Championship entirely, even if the RFU poured cold water on that idea last week. “Absolute horse manure is written about what we think about the Championship, it’s a brilliant part of the ecosystem,” said the RFU’s performance director, Conor O’Shea. “We believe this competition will give you the normal league structure, extra development and commercial opportunities and for our young players it’s an essential breeding ground for us. Our young players don’t play enough. The only way to become a better rugby player is on the pitch and we believe this [cup] competition will give us a focus, the Premiership and the Championship are behind us.” All of which sounds like a solution to the very obvious problem that young English players do not get enough game time at present but does little to address the fact that aspiring Championship clubs are having their promotion ambitions stifled. In the meantime we sit and wait, suspended in limbo.",Sport/Sport,Championship race a thriller but meaningless as RFU lets limbo persist,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/02/championship-rugby-union-rfu-ealing-doncaster-promotion
4/2/2022,"“The camp has come from the dark into the light,” says Edson Sebutozi Munyakarambi, a refugee living in the Kigeme camp in southern Rwanda. “Before the solar-powered street lamps, the camp was dark. Some people would come and steal things from the houses,” says Munyakarambi, who chairs the committee that represents the 16,000 people in the camp. “But now no one can rob people on the street corners and the children can study or play outside while they wait for their dinner.” The lamps, along with home solar systems and cleaner cooking stoves have been delivered by the Renewable Energy for Refugees (RE4R) project to three camps in Rwanda that house more than 42,000 people. The refugees say the result has been miraculous, making the camps safer and boosting children’s studies and small businesses. In particular, women and children who had to collect firewood outside the camp no longer face the danger of rape and beatings. “Providing sustainable energy to people who have lost almost everything is just so critical,” says Andrew Harper, the special adviser on climate action to the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, which runs the camps. “It reduces vulnerability but also brings people back up from a position of disempowerment and dependency to one where they’re starting to contribute back to the community. But it’s an area that is under-prioritised and underfunded in almost every operation.” Uwimana Nyirakabukari, a single mother with five children, lives in the Nyabiheke camp and now has a solar home system: a solar panel on the roof powering lights inside and a battery for charging a mobile phone. “Before this I used candles, or if I could not afford a candle, a burning stick,” she says. “But once, when I went off to the toilets in the night I came back and the mattress had caught fire. My children were about to die.” Fortunately, the fire was extinguished. But the solar lamps have not just reduced the fire risk for Nyirakabukari. “ I can study too,” she says. “I am learning to read and write, and to speak English.” She earns a living by making carrier bags to sell at markets, and having light at home now means she can work in the evening while her older children cook. “The project really helped me escape from poverty,” she adds. Like nearly all the refugees in the three camps, Nyirakabukari fled violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and has large, round scars on her legs where she was shot. The injuries have left her with a physical disability and the street lamps now help her safely navigate the rough paths in the hilly camps. For Esperance Mukabera, another Nyabiheke resident, the radio that is part of the solar home system is key. “Now, I do not feel alone,” says the 75-year-old widow, adding that her grandchildren visit to listen to their favourite shows. “Before [the solar power] it was very hard, the camp was a very dark place. Now we can go to the toilets easily, we feel safer and can move around the camp without any problems,” says Mukabera. Refugee camps are not usually associated with having fun. But it is important for wellbeing, especially for the children who account for half of the refugees at the camps. The solar street lamps have given new life to the Nyabiheke camp’s only basketball court. “The children love it more than you can express,” says Hertier Mugisha, a sports coach who came to the camp as a seven-year-old in 2007. “Before the streetlights we had many people who wanted to come, but the day was not long enough. Now it is open for the time we want.” Sport is also a form of child and youth protection, he says, diverting them from alcohol and other risks. As well as the solar systems, the refugees have been given access to cleaner cooking stoves. These burn pellets made from sawdust and waste wood and remove the dangers of collecting firewood, as well as producing much less smoke. The favourite food of Adeline Umuhoza’s two boys, aged four and eight, is spaghetti and she says the new stove has made a big change to her life in Kigeme. “Our children went to collect firewood outside the camp, but they were scared as local people could beat them,” she says. Smoke and heat from the open fires also filled her home: “You didn’t have any appetite to eat the food you had cooked.” Umuhoza and other refugees not classed as vulnerable pay for their solar systems and cooking stoves in instalments to local companies. “We believe it’s the most sustainable way,” says Denyse Umubyeyi, country manager for Practical Action, the NGO implementing the RE4R project. “It is good for the refugees because when they buy, they feel a kind of ownership, and self-reliance and dignity,” she says. “One refugee told me: ‘What is done for me without me is done against me.’” It also means many more refugees can get the systems than if they were provided for free. Seventy refugees are now employed selling and installing the solar systems. These include Safari Habaruema at the Kigeme camp. Habaruema’s sales pitch is now highly polished: “Having a solar home system really changes a life. I would say get one, and why not a Belecom system?” The RE4R project has delivered 183 streetlights, 4,000 solar home systems and 5,600 stoves across the camps so far, with some also being installed in nearby villages. Involving the host communities is important, says Jost Uwase, of the Rwanda-based EcoGreen Solutions, which has sold more cleaner stoves to local residents than to refugees: “The host community could have said those [refugees] are benefiting while we are starving. But now it’s like they are sharing.” Uwase emphasises the security benefits of the stoves: “There were cases of women being violated when they went outside the camps just collecting firewood in the neighbouring forest, so [the stoves] were an opportunity to keep them safe.” One concern about installing solar devices has been that it may make the camps more permanent. “Some organisations have been reluctant to do such infrastructure,” says Umubyeyi. “But some of these refugees have been here for 20 years. Imagine denying a human being such basic rights for all those years. Their lives have not been put on hold. Their lives go on, they have to grow, to learn, to work.” Habaruema says some people who tried to return to DRC have been killed in the continuing violence. A small number of camps around the world have installed renewable energy systems, including ones established in Jordan for Syrian refugees and in Kenya for Ethiopian refugees. But there are more than 26 million refugees worldwide and, of those living in camps, 90% do not have electricity and 80% rely on firewood for cooking. “Energy is often collecting firewood and that is causing a disaster globally,” says Harper. “If you cannot protect the environment, you cannot protect the community.” Attacks on women are increasing, he says. “As the areas around refugee settlements get more denuded from firewood, they’ve got to go further and further afield.” The climate crisis is also worsening the situation, Harper says. “Often what we’re seeing now is that when people have been forced from their homes due to a combination of conflict, as well as climate change, the potential for people to return becomes really limited [as rising temperatures make traditional farming unviable]. This is why it makes even more sense for us to be investing in longer-term displacement settlements.” Harper believes all refugee camps should have a plan for renewable energy for lighting and cooking, but funding remains a problem. “We have to drive forward the good work that is being done, and move away from pilot projects and implement these activities at the scale of the challenges. But there is a difference between what people deserve and what they get,” he says. That view is shared by Annemieke de Jong of the Ikea Foundation, which funded the €10m (£8.4m) RE4R project. “The challenge lies in scale. Humanitarian aid will always depend on external funding coming in. But what’s exciting is we see opportunities if you approach it as a market and think about what that community needs to grow, to go beyond just that aid economy and have a healthy economy,” she says. The skills that refugees learn through the renewable energy projects can also be taken back with them when they finally return to their country and start rebuilding their communities, De Jong adds. Back in Kigeme, Munyakarambi says the RE4R project has brought a huge positive change, with the only problem being that half of the camp’s residents do not have solar home systems yet. “But we cannot forget we are refugees,” he says. “My wish is to go back to my country. We have a saying: ‘If you visit someone, you have to go back before they get tired of you’. But we have to be sure there is security in Congo.”",News/Environment,‘We feel safer’: how green energy is brightening refugee lives in Rwanda,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/02/green-energy-refugee-camps-rwanda-solar-panels

4/2/2022,"On Hungary’s national day last month Viktor Orbán accused the opposition of seeking to drag the country into Russia’s war on Ukraine. The Hungarian prime minister’s highly questionable claim was the centrepiece of a 30-minute speech to supporters that was broadcast on the state TV channel M1 nine times in 24 hours. For Orbán, it was perfect coverage, as he seeks a fourth straight term in the country’s most closely fought election in years, on 3 April. The main opposition leader, Péter Márki-Zay, has also been on state TV: he got five minutes. Orbán’s patriotic message was amplified by gushing tributes on government-friendly media. “Anyone who saw or heard Orbán’s annual assessment speech, saw a successful head of government at the height of his power … in which lightness and humour were as just present as the deep and highly complex web of a statesmen’s thoughts,” said the pro-government website PestiSrácok. Over on TV2, one of the main commercial channels, an evening news anchor declared: “I am going to support Viktor Orbán on 3 April.” By contrast, it was hard to find coverage of this week’s press conference by Márki-Zay at a Habsburg estate reportedly owned by the prime minister’s father, Gyözö Orbán. Márki-Záy hammered away at one of his main themes: corruption. Pro-government news sites, such as Origo and Magyar Nemzet, did not mention the speech, nor did Hungary’s main news agency, MTI. The last-discovered reference the agency made to the Hatvanpuszta estate, alleged to have been subject to a lavish renovation, was more than 20 years ago. Welcome to the media in Hungary, where NGOs are blacklisted, critical stories are binned and senior editors instruct journalists to disregard the facts before their eyes. “We have reached a situation where our position is now much much worse than it was back in the 1980s when Hungary was a communist country,” said one person with decades of experience of Hungarian state media, recalling the days when the central European country was described as “the happiest barracks” in the eastern bloc, for its relative freedom. “The situation back then in terms of censorship and state interference in public service journalism is nowhere near, nowhere near, the situation right now,” the person told the Guardian. People familiar with MTI, a source of news for other media, say there is a blacklist of organisations that cannot be reported on, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Any attempt to write about their reports “is work done for the dustbin”, said a second source. And while there is no ban on reporting the opposition, “the coverage is profoundly lopsided in the sense that the coverage given to pro-government parties and politicians is disproportionately wider in range and scope”, one person said. “I would go as far as saying that the distribution is nine to one in the government’s favour.” While these comments refer to the news agency, the rules are said to be identical across Hungary’s public service broadcasting organisation, MTVA, which houses state TV, radio and the news agency. One senior MTI editor was said to have instructed journalists that international news agencies, such as Reuters and Associated Press, could not be trusted and should only be used for basic facts, not the wider context of their articles. Another senior MTVA editor, Balázs Bende, told staff after Joe Biden’s victory not to refer to him as US president-elect. “I’ve marked it with asterisks AGAIN that he is not president-elect, and he has not won until there is an official result,” Bende wrote in an internal mail, a copy of which has been seen by the Guardian. “And I don’t care if everyone is OK with this or not.” In another email sent more than a week after Biden’s victory was confirmed, Bende quoted Donald Trump to his staff: “He only won in the eyes of the FAKE NEWS MEDIA.” Instructions are not always needed. Senior editors are on message with the government line, an approach that worked, until Russia invaded Ukraine, forcing the traditionally pro-Kremlin Orbán government to condemn the war and side with the EU on sanctions. The script had changed, but nobody seemed to had told the state news agency, which described the invasion as a “Russian military operation” – echoing the Kremlin’s phrasing – for the first five days of the war. M1’s Russia-friendly attitude reflected the editors’ personal agenda and confusion over how to frame the war, rather than any government order, according to three sources close to state TV. Another person familiar with MTVA said they did not believe the pro-Russia stance was intentional, but reflected the exodus of professional journalists at the top. “It’s not political, it’s unprofessional. The whole thing has been so messed up that there are no clear professional criteria.” Pro-government media and numerous acolytes on Facebook have attacked the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, especially after he told Orbán to choose a side in Russia’s war on his country. Hungarian journalists joke bleakly that Zelenskiy is the new Soros, a reference to the Hungarian-born investor and philanthropist George Soros, who has been the main target of an antisemitic smear campaign by the Hungarian government and its supporters. Magyar Nemzet published an article stating that Márki-Zay’s staff had contacted Zelenskiy. Ukraine’s embassy in Budapest accused the paper of “anti-Ukrainian scaremongering”. Earlier this week, a complaint was filed to the European Commission alleging that Russian war propaganda has been “continuously disseminated” by Hungarian public media. The complaint from the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union and the Political Capital institute accuses Hungarian authorities of failing to place sanctions on public service media “when it presents disinformation as truth”. The war may be recent, but the erosion of Hungary’s independent media has been unfolding since Orbán was elected again in 2010. His victory was soon followed by a media law that asserted government control over the main media regulator. In later years, independent newspapers and websites went bankrupt or were taken over by government-friendly buyers, squeezed, in part, by state advertising heavily tilted towards pro-government outlets. Meanwhile, Hungary’s small cadre of independent media outlets have had their journalists targeted by Pegasus spyware. By 2021 the Council of Europe’s commissioner for human rights concluded: “The combined effects of a politically controlled media regulatory authority and distortionary state intervention in the media market have eroded media pluralism and freedom of expression in Hungary.” While Hungary tumbled down international press freedom rankings, EU authorities were accused of standing by. More than a decade after the country dismantled its independent media regulator, the European Commission promised a media freedom act to protect independence and pluralism across the EU. For Hungary’s opposition, slightly behind in the polls, it is too late to level the playing field. People familiar with Hungarian media do not expect any change if the current government remains in power: “The light we saw at the end of the tunnel in the late 80s is now behind us.” Responding to the main points in this report, a government spokesperson said Hungary recognised and protected the freedom and diversity of the press. Media legislation, the statement said, prevented the emergence of information monopolies and ensured pluralism. ""“The government isn’t an authority directing the public service media. If you look at the Hungarian press, if you look at Hungarian radio and television, if you look at social media, you’ll see that there are very many different opinions, a wide-ranging palette. This is very different from the media in western societies. On the whole around 50% of the Hungarian media is Christian democrat, traditionalist and conservative, while the other 50% is progressive, liberal, left-wing and so on. This is what we call pluralistic media,” said the spokesperson. MTVA did not respond to requests for comment about the allegations, including those concerning staff members named in this report.",News/World news,Hungary: where editors tell reporters to disregard facts before their eyes,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/02/hungary-independent-media-editors-reporters-orban
4/2/2022,"In general, the hours we spend on budget airlines are not ones we’re particularly keen to relive, so a film that vividly recreates the unique ambience of a Ryanair flight is probably not, on paper, moving to the top of your must-see list. But I’d encourage you to fight those instincts for Zero Fucks Given, a marvellously titled French film newly streaming on Mubi. Those three words could, I suppose, encapsulate the service experience on many a low-cost carrier. Instead, they refer to the pushed-to-the-brink attitude of young flight attendant Cassandre, who works with increasing exasperation for Wing, a fictitious airline that resembles Ryanair about as closely as possible (down to the garish yellow-and-blue branding) without inviting legal action. Based, if barely rooted, in Lanzarote, she spends her days jetting from one European city to another, racking up miles but no real sense of place in the world. Her dream is to work for the loftier Emirates, though one wonders if a better uniform and richer customers will make her much happier. Cassandre is played with tart wit and riveting, magnified emotional acuity by Adèle Exarchopoulos, in the sharpest showcase for her gifts since 2013’s Blue Is the Warmest Colour. Bright and piquant as a character study, Zero Fucks Given is also the kind of pointed, anti-capitalist study of a service industry that makes you reconsider your role in it, even as you guiltily book that bargain flight to Budapest. The mistreatment to which Cassandre is subjected from management and clientele alike is caustically observed by first-time writer-directors Julie Lecoustre and Emmanuel Marre, but this isn’t a bitter or ungenerous film; beneath its top-down critique of an industry lies a tender, humane sympathy for its heroine’s wanderlust. It’s certainly the best film portrait yet of cabin crew life, flintier than the breezy pastel comedy of the 2003 Gwyneth Paltrow vehicle View from the Top (Chili), which didn’t quite deserve the critical pasting it got, and actually funnier than Pedro Almodóvar’s goofy, horny Madrid-to-Mexico farce I’m So Excited! (2013; Mubi), the Spanish master’s most disposable film, though not without its sparks. In general, however, films about flying play more on our fears of being up in the air than its comic potential. The all-star 1954 melodrama The High and the Mighty (Amazon) set the template for the aviation disaster film, complete with John Wayne as a PTSD-afflicted first officer and a host of drama-bearing passengers struggling through terrifying engine trouble; it’s pure studio-Hollywood cheese, but grandly effective, with a memorable, Oscar-winning score. In 1970, Airport (Apple TV) expanded the formula to blockbuster levels, braiding crises both on board and on the ground, with Burt Lancaster and Dean Martin stoically heading the action; you can see why it was a franchise-birthing smash, but since it was so comprehensively and riotously lampooned a decade later by Airplane! (Now TV) – now far more of a classic – it’s hard to watch with a straight face. Since 9/11, dramatised with such palm-sweating conviction by Paul Greengrass in United 93 (2006; Netflix), though it’s not a film anyone wants to watch twice, the airborne thriller has been trickier territory. As claustrophobically well made as it was, the fictional terrorists-on-board film 7500 (2019; Amazon), led by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, felt in debatable taste. Probably safest, then, for the aeroplane movie to steer itself into fully far-fetched territory, as with Wes Craven’s tight, nasty overnight chiller Red Eye (2005; Google Play) or the character-centred drama of Denzel Washington’s alcoholic-pilot-in-crisis performance in Flight (2012; Netflix), which follows grounded procedural form after one white-knuckle in-air sequence. Or, indeed, Samuel L Jackson’s self-explanatory quandary in Snakes on a Plane (2006; Amazon), among the worst flight films, maybe, but surely the most quotable. The Bubble(Netflix)There’s claustrophobic comic potential in Judd Apatow’s Covid-themed showbiz farce, following a group of actors forced to isolate together on a closed film set during lockdown, but the results are strangely flat-footed – a snapshot of a recent time that already feels (perhaps mercifully) dated. The cast, including Leslie Mann, Karen Gillan and David Duchovny, tries, but the spark isn’t there. Spider-Man: No Way Home(Sony)Fresh from supposedly saving cinemas’ bacon in the past few months, this gazillion-grossing Marvel entry finally makes its way to streaming and DVD and even if you haven’t seen it yet, you’ve probably heard the full spectrum of opinions about it. Count me among those unconvinced by its tenuous, franchise-bridging storytelling, hinging on a multiverse gimmick far more inventively deployed in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, and its oddly drab, synthetic spectacle. But what do I know? Zeros and Ones(Signature)After the Vatican is blown up in a dystopian, plague-era Rome, an American soldier (Ethan Hawke) sets out to find the terrorists responsible. The synopsis sounds more Dan Brown or Michael Bay than Abel Ferrara, but the avant garde American auteur puts his curious stamp on this shadowy, philosophically probing thriller; one more for his most patient fans than anyone seeking conventional action.",Arts/Film,Streaming: the best films set on aeroplanes,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/02/streaming-the-best-films-set-on-aeroplanes

4/2/2022,"At 11.30pm one night a few weeks back, I looked into the mirror and decided that I wanted my hair in a bob. Had I not been lucky enough to secure the first appointment the following morning, I wouldn’t have put it past me to reach for the scissors and have a go myself. When the urge for a bob strikes, it can be an unstoppable force. It’s also very much the hairstyle of the moment – see celebrity bob squad Nicola Coughlan, Kaia Gerber and Zoë Kravitz. We’ve just completed two years of existing mostly indoors, with only sporadic access to professional hairdressing for much of that time – and the novelty of longer hair wore off not long after that of Tiger King and making banana bread. Reducing my hair length felt breezy, a bit “back to business”. And a bob satisfies the whim for dramatic change without being as scary and bone-structure-dependent as, say, a pixie crop. Nonetheless, one should not bob rashly, according to George Northwood, creator of signature bobs for regulars Alexa Chung and Sienna Miller. He concedes that bobs “suit everyone”, but says the key decision to be made is between a hard bob (Anna Wintour, say, or Venus Williams’ latest look) and a soft one (see actors Camille Cottin and Gemma Chan). Regardless of face shape, very soft features look great against sharp cuts, while stronger features and bone structures suit messier, tousled bobs that are a cinch to style. “A bob is the shortest you can go without having to overhaul your styling routine,” says Northwood, and I agree – I can now do everything as before, only it takes me half the time. As for length, the bob can rest anywhere between the ear and the shoulder, but Northwood says the bob’s ability to grow out and remain a look is a huge part of its appeal – especially now: “Hairdressing has evolved slightly. We’ve all realised we can eke out a style for longer than we thought, and that’s preferable to being in a salon every five minutes.” If you choose a one-length bob without a fringe (people with very thick hair should ask their stylist to slice in, as “thick bobs can look mushroomy otherwise”, says Northwood), you’re fine to leave it eight weeks between appointments. “And it’s also painless – if you regret bobbing it in the first place, you’ll be back pretty much where you started in three months.” No chance of that. I’ve already booked my trim.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Looking for a hairstyle that’s very now?

4/2/2022,"For some, it’s the sound of a knock at the door, or the thud of an explosion, shattering windows and splitting open the earth. For others, it’s the smell of smoke on the wind, or a text typed in capitals signalling that water levels are set to suddenly rise. Whether a human rights defender at risk of arrest, a family living in a conflict zone or a woman planning to flee domestic violence in the middle of the night, they have one thing in common: a bag packed ready with this moment in mind. It does little to dull their fear, they say. But gathering life’s essentials means they know they’re prepared if they have to run. Whatever their warning looks like – however much time they have – they’re ready to go. The origins of the “go-bag” are storied and imprecise: for as long as civilisation has existed, so has danger, disaster and war. From the romanticised illustration of a runaway, packing his life into a handkerchief and tying it to the end of a stick, to the black-and-white photos of children dragging suitcases during the second world war, history tells us people in times of crisis have always found themselves forced to condense the expanse of their lives into small, portable packages. Today, the reasons and ways that people prepare their go-bags vary. Ever since Russian troops invaded Ukraine in February, more than 10 million residents have found themselves forced to cram their belongings into backpacks, their lives falling apart at a moment’s notice. Travelling for miles, often on foot, women and children grip pet carriers and teddy bears. In other countries, environmental disasters pose the most dangerous threat, displacing more than 7 million in 2020. In flood-prone areas of south Asia, extreme weather sees backpacks kept in bin bags, sometimes on the highest shelf, while those living in regions at risk of wildfire make sure their birth certificates are safe in a heatproof box, ready by the door. For millions of women experiencing domestic abuse, a go-bag needs to be discreet – and preferably stored somewhere out of the house. With autocratic and authoritarian regimes on the rise, human rights defenders and activists are also uniquely vulnerable. According to the international human rights network HRD Memorial, more than 900 human rights defenders have been killed worldwide in the past three years. The Swedish non-governmental organisation Civil Rights Defenders, meanwhile, reports a worrying increase in requests for urgent assistance from those who need to go into hiding after experiencing death threats, violence and arrests. Rather than flee their countries to seek safety, they exist in a state of perpetual danger – often carrying a toothbrush and a change of clothes whenever they leave the house. “They have a really strong will to stay and work where they are, because that’s where they see the need for them,” says Gabrielle Gunneberg, Civil Rights Defenders’ global programme director. “They’re very brave people.” But what would you pack if you knew you might have to leave your home at any moment, and weren’t sure when (and if) you’d be able to return? Glen Haydon, lives in wildfire territory Ever since he was a boy scout, 45-year-old Glen Haydon has subscribed to the motto of always being prepared. “But my idea of what that means has definitely evolved over time.” As a wildland firefighter based in California, he knows what it means for a fire to raze your home to the ground. “I’ve seen a lot of people sifting through the debris of their houses and have had to try to put myself in their shoes, and it’s just a very deep loss,” he says. “I hope I never have to experience that.” Recently, the climate crisis has seen fires along the US west coast growing more frequent. “In the last six years, there’s been a significant shift in the scope, destruction and devastation these fires have caused,” Haydon says. “Every year for the last few years we’ve said, ‘Oh man, it’s the worst season ever.’ It’s almost a joke now, because even this year, it’s drier than it was a year before. “The seriousness of it means I’m always making sure the family knows where everything is,” he adds. Last summer, when his wife was pregnant, she messaged Haydon to say she had received a text alert advising those in the area to evacuate. He was out of signal, fighting another fire. Following his previous instructions, she grabbed their emergency bag from the closet and the documents they kept in a fireproof envelope, along with the pet carriers for their two cats and a sword Haydon had inherited from his grandfather, before heading to a friend’s house. “In my experience, you could have a day or two, or you could have minutes, depending on where the fire started and where it is in relation to you,” Haydon says. “My wife and I always err on the side of caution. If you get that alert, that means you just go.” The fire changed course, and their house remained unscathed. “But it was hard being away and not knowing what I was going to return to,” Haydon says. He finds it difficult not to imagine the worst. In 2018, a fire ripped through the town of Paradise in the Sierra Nevada foothills, killing 85 people and destroying 19,000 buildings and homes. Haydon and his team were some of the first on the scene. “It still haunts me,” he says. Since his daughter’s birth, Haydon’s sense of caution has grown – as has his collection of go-bags. “We have a little diaper bag that’s constantly packed and ready,” he says. “It’s just part of that essential kit, and goes everywhere with us.” Even as the climate crisis worsens, he can’t see his family leaving California. “The probability of a fire lining up for your particular house is slim,” he says. “You don’t have to live in constant fear, but you do have to live in a state of awareness.” Farrah, LGBTQ+ activist It was Farrah’s* daughter who persuaded her to pack a bag (pictured left, top) and keep it ready on a shoe rack, next to the front door. “She was so worried about me. So we packed a small backpack, in case I ever have to escape.” For most of her adult life, Farrah, 62, kept her sexuality a secret. Her daughter knew she was a lesbian, along with a couple of close friends, but that was it. In Bangladesh, homosexuality is illegal; sharing the information more widely would put her at risk. That changed in 2006, when she met a group of teenagers through work and realised many of them were also struggling with their sexuality or gender identity. Some were facing arranged marriages to men, others were wrestling with their mental health. “They thought it was a disease, and that they weren’t like normal people,” Farrah says. “I wanted to help them to overcome that.” Farrah began quietly building an informal support network of lesbian women and transgender men across the country – providing free counselling via an anonymous helpline, plus legal advice and vocational training for those who needed to leave heterosexual relationships. But such work carries risks. In 2016, religious extremists killed Farrah’s fellow LGBTQ+ activist and close friend Xulhaz Mannan in a violent attack. “I thought things were progressing and we were getting safer,” she recalls. “But then Xulhaz was murdered, and I realised we were still at zero.” After her contacts warned her she was next on the hitlist, she didn’t leave the house for four months. Even now, she wraps a heavy scarf around her neck before stepping outside. “That way, if they try to cut my throat, I will have made it more difficult for them.” The contents of Farrah’s bag are practical: underwear, two pairs of jeans, five T-shirts, medicines for her blood pressure and diabetes, plus candles and a lighter. In her purse, she keeps photos of her daughter and her four-month-old granddaughter. She doesn’t need anything else, she says. “Society is still where it was 50 years ago,” she adds. “They could do anything to me at any time, for any reason. There was and there is no hope of being recognised as a lesbian woman in Bangladesh.” Leaving the country isn’t an option. “There’s nobody to take my place,” Farrah says. “I think of all the young women and girls across the country who grow up feeling like there is something wrong with them. I will never abandon them.” María Elena Mir Marrero, human rights activist In the early 1990s, when María Elena Mir Marrero (left) started campaigning for human rights in Cuba, her neighbours initially thought she was working as a spy for the CIA. “We could hear you typing late at night, so we assumed you were filing reports to the US,” they told her years later, to her bemusement. When Mir Marrero admitted the truth – that she was part of an underground network of activists working to combat state censorship and speaking out against the corrupt justice system under Cuba’s authoritarian regime – they seemed even more concerned than before. “People treat me like I am doing something wrong,” Mir Marrero, 60, says now. “But I will never understand why wanting a better life for me and my society is something bad.” For a long time, she worked in secret: hiding fellow dissidents in her house, quietly fearful of what government officials would do if they discovered them. When she was finally exposed, the threats were worse than she imagined. She temporarily went into hiding, and sometimes left the house wearing a disguise. But she continued working to oppose the government, even when officials threatened to take away her three-year-old son. Over time, Mir Marrero began writing letters to him to try to explain why her work was so important that she would risk their separation. “I feel like I stole his childhood,” she says. “It’s been a life of feeling completely isolated, discriminated against and always being afraid.” Now in his 30s, her son has a child of his own, but Mir Marrero can’t let him visit her house. “I don’t want my grandchild to live through what their father lived through,” she says. “I have to avoid repeating the story.” Despite hopes that life would improve after former president Fidel Castro died in 2016, Mir Marrero’s situation in Cuba remains precarious, with threats coming through every few weeks. She still packs the same emergency bags and leaves them around the house, so there is always one in easy reach if she has to flee. “Most of the time, you don’t even have time to take them,” she says. Each bag contains the same basic items: underwear, a toothbrush and toothpaste and roll-on deodorant. “I don’t need anything else,” she says. The truth is, she is tired of running. After three decades of fighting for basic human rights, when it comes to her own safety, Mir Marrero says she has nothing left to fear. “I learned that the more you hide, or the more you try to protect yourself, the more they will laugh,” she says. “So much has already been taken from me … I am no longer afraid of anything.” She believes the government wants her to leave Cuba. “And I will not give them that.” Le Tran, human rights activist In April 2016, a Taiwanese steel plant released toxic waste into the sea off the Vietnamese coast, killing more than 100 tonnes of fish and destroying thousands of livelihoods overnight. The news sparked protests across the country, and caught the attention of 28-year-old Le Tran*. She had never campaigned against anything before – at least, not publicly – but the cause struck a chord. Soon she was travelling up and down the country, speaking out against the Vietnamese government’s apparent negligence, and befriending activists who were protesting about other issues, such as digital surveillance, human rights and torture. “It just happened naturally, day by day,” she says. “I followed my heart, and became an activist.” It was only later that Tran heard her activities had potentially caught the attention of the authorities, and she risked having her passport confiscated if she didn’t get out of the country fast. She hasn’t seen her family in person since. Today Tran, 33, is based in Thailand, part of a tight community of Vietnamese dissidents, all unable to return home. There’s comfort to be found in shared experience, Tran says: everyone is always looking out for one another. But their proximity to Vietnam presents a problem. “There are a lot of Vietnamese secret agents in Thailand who observe the Vietnamese community,” she says, citing an incident in 2019, when the Vietnamese journalist Truong Duy Nhat applied for refugee status in Thailand, only to be sent back to Hanoi, where he remains imprisoned. “It is really dangerous.” With her friends facing the same threats, well-practised measures are baked into their social lives. “Most of the time we speak English, and we speak really quietly so people will not know we’re Vietnamese,” Tran says. Even sharing a flat is considered too much of a risk. “If I get arrested, I can send an SOS message to my friend and she can help,” Tran says. If they lived together, she worries they would be arrested at the same time and nobody would know. Even at home, Tran can’t relax. “During the night-time, if I hear any noise, my eyes are wide open,” she says. “I am always alert, always ready.” On the kitchen table are two backpacks (pictured page 28) – one to wear on her front, one on her back. “In my small bag, I pack my passport, purses, earphones, power bank, charger, notebook, pen, flash lamp, whistle, bag with basic skin care and medicines, hand sanitiser and chocolate,” she says. “In the large bag, I keep my laptop, charger and mouse.” She doesn’t know if she will ever need them, but having them within arms’ reach is a comfort. “I know that in case of emergency, I can run immediately,” she says. “I might be in danger, but that makes me feel safe.” Donna Walker, flood victim Donna Walker, 50, always knew her house was at risk of flooding – though she didn’t believe it would happen. Lismore, a small, vibrant city of 27,000 in New South Wales, is built on a floodplain, and when the rains come, water levels rise fast. Most of the houses are elevated to mitigate the risks, and Walker’s stands more than 2 metres above the street, raised high on wooden stilts. Water had never entered the property, though in 2017 it lapped against the front door. Nevertheless, Walker knew the drill: if the skies darkened, she would look to the authorities for warnings. She also kept overnight bags packed in case she and her four children needed to leave at short notice. When the State Emergency Service advised her to evacuate in February this year, she followed the protocol. The family gathered their bags, each one stuffed with blankets, pillows and phone chargers. “At least if you’re in an evacuation centre, you’re lying on your own pillow which smells of home,” Walker says. “I thought that was really important.” They didn’t take their birth certificates, or their three cats, Black Jack, Nyla and Casper. Unnecessarily evacuating the cats would be more traumatic for them in the long run, Donna thought. Hours later, as the news showed the water levels rising past houses’ front doors and up to their roofs, Walker and her children sobbed. “Overnight my whole family’s life was completely shattered,” she says. More than a week passed before they could return to their home, where they found its contents destroyed. Miraculously, their cats had survived; the family’s birth certificates and essential documents did not. “We really should have taken them,” Walker says. “But we never thought for a second that the water was going to come inside.” The flood water was contaminated with sewage, and nearly everything the family owned had to be thrown away, from her children’s artwork to certificates honouring Walker’s parents’ roles during the second world war. “I mainly cried when I saw the pile of rubbish outside my house, made up of everything that I’ve treasured and loved,” Walker says. “It broke my heart.” Jon, human rights activist As a child, Jon* grew up watching his father grab a plastic bag full of clothes from under his desk every time he left the house. For a long time Jon didn’t understand its purpose; it was only when he was a teen he realised his father was campaigning against the Philippine government, and needed to be prepared to go into hiding at a moment’s notice. “It was his contingency plan,” Jon says. By the time Jon was in his late 20s, he, too, was involved in activism, organising workers and helping them demand better pay and conditions. But when hardliner Rodrigo Duterte became president in 2016, Jon and his father found themselves facing a renewed sense of fear. This was a president who suggested the Philippine police shoot any activists who got in their way. Concerned, Jon’s father advised his son to pack his own emergency bag. “A bag was something all the activists had [in the 1980s],” Jon, 34, says. “That practice has been passed on to our generation.” Still, neither father nor son took the threats especially seriously – until early 2020, when unidentified gunmen fatally shot Jon’s father, after a government-endorsed smear campaign that had tagged him as a communist. “Nobody thought he would be killed,” Jon says. “In the weeks before, we were exchanging messages over [Facebook], and he was telling me that he received another death threat via text message or something like that. We shrugged it off, because that was so normal.” The killings of Filipino human rights defenders and activists have become increasingly common since then. In 2021, authorities falsely accused Jon of communism and human trafficking, pasting his photo in the streets and broadcasting allegations against him over the radio. “I heard someone say once that they eat threats for breakfast,” he says. “Here in the Philippines, we eat threats for breakfast, lunch and dinner.” He pauses. “The scary part is not the threat itself. The scary part is that you don’t know whether someone you meet in the street will just kill you for no reason.” These days, Jon lives a wary, careful existence – isolated from former friends, a bag tucked under his bed containing two sets of clothes, fake IDs, a first aid kit and an emergency phone. He can’t count the number of times he has had to go into hiding over the past two years, but he knows it is unlikely to stop soon: the threats are escalating ahead of presidential elections in May. Duterte cannot run due to a one-term limit, but his daughter Sara is campaigning to be vice-president, with the former Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos’ son, Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos, on the same ticket. “Everyone is on red alert right now,” Jon says. He struggles to process how many lives have been lost. “But when we see their bodies in the coffins, that’s when the feeling sinks in that this is really happening to us.” Issam Younis, human rights activist Every time Issam Younis, 58, sees the two hand-luggage-sized suitcases by his front door, he feels a tug of sadness. “You remember war is there, danger is there,” he says. Nevertheless, he reviews their contents frequently: replacing out-of-date medicine; adding a new certificate or piece of paperwork here and there. It’s not unusual to go to friends’ houses and see their own suitcases tucked into a corner. “In 12 years, we have experience four large-scale offences in Gaza since 2008,” he says. “So a bag is a must.” “You cannot pack your sofas or your kitchen,” he adds. “But at least you could save your history, your humanity, by keeping your parents’ pictures or the graduation of a son or your certificate of marriage … Other things do not matter so much.” His wife packed her jewellery, while Younis included some painting materials and his old diaries. “Based on our experience, these are the most important things,” he says. The uncomfortable truth, Younis knows, is that the suitcases serve little purpose: in real moments of danger, it is unlikely there will be time to grab them. “An escalation could take place at any moment,” he says. “In a minute, the whole situation can change.” In 2014, Israeli armed forces bombed the house next door to his father in the middle of the night. His dad was killed instantly, still sleeping in his bed. Even in the wider context of conflict, Younis’s work heading the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights makes him a high-profile target, he says. For the past 30 years, he has been campaigning to end the Israeli occupation of Palestine, while advocating for reparations for those whose lives have already been lost. In recent years, the death threats and accusations of antisemitism levelled against Younis and his colleagues have grown in number. “The truth is expensive,” he says sadly. “If you go for the truth, you have to be ready to pay the consequences.” Younis knows he and his wife could leave Gaza at a moment’s notice, but he says they plan to stay in Palestine, whatever the cost. “I stay because I’m a human, and delivering justice is a human act,” he says. “I’m full of hope that the situation will change, and the occupation will be eradicated … This is a just cause and it deserves our time and our lives.” Abdalle Ahmed Mumin, journalist Each morning, as Abdalle Ahmed Mumin, 37, locks his door to go to work, he swings a small, nondescript bag over his shoulder. Its contents include his laptop and notebooks, alongside a phone charger, encrypted hard drive and a new toothbrush. For the next 12 hours, the bag will never leave his sight. Nothing else is important, he says: clothes are easily replaced; it’s his work that takes priority. In one of the most dangerous countries to be a journalist, Mumin understands the risks that accompany reporting on corruption and human rights abuses in Somalia. A civil war dating back decades has seen the government splinter and strengthened already powerful terrorist groups. Last year, violent confrontations between various security forces displaced between 60,000 and 100,000 residents in Mogadishu, the country’s capital. “Every day is a risk day,” Mumin says. “You have to be prepared.” The danger comes from all directions. Last year, dozens of journalists were arrested by state authorities, and two were killed by the militant group al-Shabaab. “I often feel like I am just waiting to die,” Mumin says. His family live abroad, after he decided it was safer for them to leave the country in 2015. “It is very difficult balancing between my family and the security situation, and my work as a journalist and a human rights defender,” he says. “They miss me so much.” Threats to cut off his head or his tongue arrive daily, sent anonymously over social media or passed on by word of mouth. Mumin takes them all seriously – and follows a well-worn, stressful routine that sees him seemingly drop off the face of the Earth until he judges it safe enough to return. Even when he is not in hiding, he does not leave his apartment except to go to work. “I call my assistant and ask him to buy food for me and bring it to my home,” he says. “I’m trying to limit my exposure to the outside.” Following his wife and children out of Somalia isn’t an option. “This job, it is my calling,” he says. “It is my moral duty.” But that doesn’t make it easy. “When you are a journalist in Somalia, you have enemies all the time,” he says. “When the military groups are going to target you, when the government is your enemy, when the criminals are attacking you, how can you ever feel safe?” Sal, LGBTQ+ activist The worst thing about going into hiding, in Sal’s* experience, is that you can’t let your family or friends know you’re safe, and they can’t tell you if they are OK either. “You’re not meant to use your phone,” the 38-year-old explains. “So they’re not sure where I am, and I cannot tell them, and then I’m not certain if my house will be raided, or if they will be arrested. Will they be attacked?” Sometimes, she remains cut off from the outside world for weeks at a time. “It’s a very lonely life.” Twelve years ago, when Sal first spoke out against Uganda’s proposed “anti-homosexuality bill”, reinforcing existing legislation that criminalised consensual adult relationships of the same sex, other members of the LGBTQ+ community warned her she was taking a dangerous path. People would try to kill her, they said, advising her to use a different route home every day and to change her address every three months. “It wasn’t like now, when people have security training,” Sal says. “Everybody was just trying to figure out how to survive.” Her elder brother beat her for bringing shame on the family and her friends “fear being associated with my sexuality, so they stayed away from me”. Sal debated leaving the country, but felt that too many people depended on her to speak on their behalf. So, instead, she whittled down her possessions to the bare necessities and took to carrying a toothbrush and a change of clothes wherever she went. “You were never sure if you were going back home,” she says. The only item of any personal value was a small passport photo of her mother, who died when she was 12. But one day her backpack was stolen; after that, the bag’s contents became a matter of practicality and little more. After 10 years of trying to raise awareness of LGBTQ+ rights, Sal recognises there is not much she can do to prevent the threats. Rarely a week passes without a man approaching her and threatening to rape or kill her; she believes local law enforcement has tapped her phone at least once. “It’s very scary,” she says. “If you do not know who to trust, you don’t know when you will be attacked.” Despite the dangers, Sal says she will never stop advocating for the people who need her – even if she has to spend the rest of her life looking over her shoulder. “I know I’m not alone,” she says. “There’s somebody out there who identifies as I do, and who is going through more trauma than I am … If I stopped fighting today, who would fight for them?” Luisa, environmental campaigner Once every couple of months, Luisa*, 58, empties the large bag she keeps packed ready for emergencies, and washes the clothes. Three sets of trousers, three blouses and a jacket: all drying in the sun. “I live in a humid area,” she says. “So even if the clothes are super-clean, I have to wash them.” She hesitates. “If I had to run that day, I couldn’t. But normally I have it ready.” Her family teases her because the bag is so large – aside from the clothes, she packs a first aid kit, nail clippers, shampoo, deodorant and hand cream. “They say, ‘Where are you planning to travel with that?’” She laughs. “But I’ve had to run away in the past, so I know how important it is.” Most of the time, she heads to a small shelter that locals have established with the help of funds from Amnesty International. “We’re trying to keep it as a second base,” she says. “The problem is we never have enough money to build our own emergency fund for things like this. We have to rely on other people.” Luisa has had to use the shelter several times. As a farmer and environmental activist from a small community on the edge of the Amazon, she and her neighbours face frequent threats from militant groups, government officials and oil companies, all with their own stake in the land. To defend their territory, Luisa helped to form an organisation dedicated to educating and empowering the community’s youngest generations – teaching them to marry modern agricultural techniques with ancestral traditions. “These oil companies, the message they send is that the only road to development is through destruction,” she says. “That goes against our idea, which is that you can also develop through preservation.” The more locals resist, the more severe the threats they receive. Recently, Luisa was told someone was planning to attack her house with a grenade, and she had to flee with another activist and two bodyguards in the middle of the night. “Lately, I can’t leave my house if I’m not accompanied,” she says. “These groups are killing entire families.” Luisa was suffering from Covid-19 at the time. The illness and the stress from threats left her feeling as if she was having a nervous breakdown. As the farmers’ unofficial spokesperson, Luisa knows she is a target, but she is keen to emphasise that her neighbours are risking their lives for the same cause. “I don’t feel comfortable when people assume I’m doing all the work, because behind me there are women, there are young people and there are children,” she says. “They are just too scared to be exposed.” Mumine, citizen journalistBy the time Mumine met her husband Seyran Saliev at university, he was already an established activist. Whenever Eid approached, he would wander the campus, raising money for families who were struggling, or whose children were sick. Mumine, who was studying economics, admired his enthusiasm. But her own life’s path was different, she thought. After the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, Putin’s military forces occupied the Crimean peninsula and declared it part of the Russian Federation. Reports of the Russian authorities persecuting Tatar Muslims – an ethnic minority local to Crimea – quickly began to emerge. Saliev started attending trials for fellow activists and used the local mosque’s loudspeaker to publicly warn the neighbourhood that the Russian authorities were searching locals’ houses. Unable to stand by and watch, Mumine began working as a citizen journalist, joining her husband in the streets. “When the system destroys the destinies and families of dozens of peaceful people very close to you, it is impossible to pretend and live peacefully as if nothing is happening,” she says. But the couple’s actions quickly drew attention from the Russian authorities. In 2017, when Mumine was pregnant with their fourth child, officials raided their apartment and detained Saliev for more than a week. Six months later, it happened again, but this time, Saliev was arrested and sentenced to 16 years imprisonment in a maximum security facility 700km away. “When the door closed behind my husband, I looked at my children,” Mumine, 36, remembers. “I had to do something.” Over the following months, the arrests continued and more of Mumine’s loved ones disappeared. Over the next five years, approximately 10% of Crimean Tatars fled the region for mainland Ukraine. Ever since, Mumine has lived “in a mode without sleep and rest” as she works to document the persecution of her community and to support other women whose husbands have been arrested. Aware of the risks, she keeps two bags packed at all times: one with her passport, press card, a loaded power bank and a camera; another with a toothbrush and toothpaste, headache tablets and the Qur’an. She prays she will never have to use them. “I don’t live in paranoia,” she says. “But at the same time, I understand what reality I live in.” When Russia invaded Ukraine in February, Mumine was in Kyiv, travelling home from the launch of her photography exhibition, Born After Arrest, which depicts the lives of Crimean children whose fathers have been imprisoned by the Russian regime. Surrounded by families fleeing the country, their own emergency bags on their backs, Mumine felt a familiar sense of panic. “My chest aches and burns, as if my heart is broken into small pieces,” she says, following a terrifying seven-day journey through eastern Europe to make it back to Crimea, where her children were staying with their grandmother. “The lives of many people are in real danger.” Amara, domestic violence survivor By the time Amara*, 29, went into hiding, she had already had a panic button installed in her house, and had contacted the police many times. But those measures weren’t keeping her safe, and her ex-partner had been threatening her for more than seven years. “It took so long for the police to take it seriously,” she says. “I just shut it out and hoped for the best and tried to do what I could to placate him, not to make the situation worse.” The best option, the authorities told her, would be to move – and not to tell anyone where she was. The domestic abuse charity Refuge could provide a room for Amara and her seven-year-old son on the other side of the country. But they would need to be ready to move in two days’ time. “I had to choose between two places, and I’d never been to either of them before in my life,” she remembers. “But that was our only way to stay safe.” Today, Amara laughs quietly as she recalls packing her and her son’s belongings into two small suitcases and a supermarket “bag for life”. “A bag for life is supposed to mean that the bag would last for ever, but, for me, it was a bag for my actual life,” she says. She struggled to select the few items she had space for – desperate to bring the cleaning products that could soothe her compulsive need to wipe down all the surfaces on arrival. “Another factor for me was race, because I needed specific hair products,” she adds. “If I moved to an incredibly white village, it might be difficult to access them.” Her son was another consideration. Amara packed an iPad and headphones so she could sit him on her lap and turn up the volume as she navigated a bureaucratic maze of paperwork and legal documents, describing her former partner’s threats again and again. “The conversations were distressing for me – and definitely not appropriate for him to hear.” Her son wanted to take his Play-Doh collection. “But when you’re trying to decide between clothes and Play-Doh, there’s a clear winner.” For the next eight months, Amara and her son lived out of their suitcases – unable to tell anyone they met where they were from, or what they were doing in their new city. But for all the trauma, Amara considers herself lucky. “For some women, packing a bag or gathering their documents could put them in more danger,” she says. “We had a whole weekend to make sure we had the essentials we needed.” * Names have been changed for security reasons.",News/Global development,Your life is under threat.

4/2/2022,"Almost a decade ago a group of Canadian and British scientists made a remarkable observation about the social lives of sperm whales in the Sargasso and Caribbean seas. While mother whales dived deep to hunt for squid, others assumed the role of “allomothers”, caring for the calf at the water’s surface (the popular press referred to these whales as “babysitters”). The paper by the scientists was part of a growing body of eye-opening research into whales’ social behaviour, which centres on those close-knit groups called pods. Pods, human as well as cetacean, come up repeatedly in Doreen Cunningham’s debut, Soundings, a striking, brave and often lyrical book that defies easy interpretation. It’s the story of a single mother and her two-year-old son, Max, and their journey to follow the whales that migrate from Baja California to the Arctic. But this is not really a work of natural history. Mother and son are in a state of turmoil and, like the whales they pursue, must navigate an environment that appears callous, if not hostile, and rely on friendship to get by. The experiences of the alienated pair are inseparable from their literary quarry, and as they travel up the Pacific coast, whale and human cultures seem to converge, eroding the gap between ourselves and our distant mammalian cousins. An engineering graduate, Cunningham had a busy career as a London-based climate journalist, covering stories all around the world, including in Alaska (her time with Iñupiat whalers provides a key thread in the book as well as a wealth of fascinating ethnographic material). After a painful custody dispute with her son’s father, she returns with the boy to Jersey, the island where she grew up. Depleted, insolvent and isolated, she takes refuge in a hostel for single mothers and it is here that she conceives her plan to follow whales with her young son. Cunningham adroitly sidesteps much of the male-dominated narratives about whales and whaling, and clearly takes inspiration more from Inuit mythology than from Herman Melville. She and her son make for an unconventionally heroic pair, travelling by plane, train, bus and boat, and incurring disapproving looks and small humiliations in their quest to spot grey whales. Initially it seems that nothing fits, including lifejackets, and at times the landscape seems irredeemably hostile (even cacti appear to give them the finger). Whale mothers and their calves, meanwhile, surface and dive alongside the pair, and Cunningham movingly describes their bonds of cooperation, which find pointed echoes and contrasts in her travelling companions and personal relationships. Her sensuous descriptions of grey whales and humpbacks provide some of the book’s richest passages; she looks at the whales and then looks at her son, looking at whales, which look back. What could she hope to gain by taking her two-year-old on such a long journey, one that might catapult her further into debt and distance her from family? Early on this question is lodged in the writer’s and reader’s mind alike, and it simmers, tantalisingly, throughout the book. At times the narrator seems fixated on obtaining a transformative encounter with the whale, almost betraying a desire to jump the species barrier. Yet she is no Ahab; it is not a single whale to which she is drawn, but the collective, and in the end the whales act as stepping-stones, bridges to human relationships on her journey, notably with other women and mothers. What at first seems a reckless, near-mystical pursuit of an imagined being leads her to find a human pod of her own.  Soundings: Journeys in the Company of Whales is published by Virago (£18.99).

4/2/2022,"When Lebanon’s Muslims sat down to their first iftar of Ramadan tonight, the meal in front of them will have cost significantly more than it did six weeks ago. The Middle Eastern country, already mired in economic crisis and battling inflation before the war broke out in Ukraine, now finds itself grappling with even higher price rises for wheat and cooking oil. “In 2021, when the prices were already up, I was using the same oil to cook several dishes,” Mona Amsha, from Beirut, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation this week. “Now, I can’t even do that.” The fears around wheat imports – more than 60% of which came last year from Ukraine – are particularly acute because Lebanon’s reserves are limited. The huge explosion that tore through Beirut’s port in August 2020 and killed more than 200 people also destroyed the main grain silos. As a result, the country is thought to have enough wheat to last only about six weeks. The government has said it is trying to secure fresh imports from India, the US and Kazakhstan – all of which would entail grain travelling much longer distances on increasingly expensive shipping routes. Meanwhile, according to agriculture minister Abbas Hajj Hassan: “There is no wheat crisis today in Lebanon.” But shortages are already starting to show on supermarket shelves; some bakeries are rationing bread, and the price rises since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine are obvious, says Bujar Hoxha, country director for Care International. “From 24 February to 21 March we have seen a general increase of 14% on food prices,” he says. “For bread, for example, it’s 27%. For white sugar it’s 72%. For sunflower oil it’s 83%.” Fears are also mounting over the cost of fuel, essential to the supply of electricity and water. Few sections of society are more vulnerable to these changes than Lebanon’s 1.5 million Syrian refugees, most of whom live in abject poverty and are dependent on food aid. Many fled Russian bombardment in their homeland and are now preparing to feel the knock-on effects of another of Vladimir Putin’s wars. “When we think of poverty, I always try to use the sea level,” says Hoxha. “If there are Lebanese living below the poverty line, we always have to imagine Syrian refugees being minus-20 sea level on that poverty line.” The decision of some countries to bar exports has exacerbated the problem. Last week the Lebanese prime minister, Najib Mikati, asked Algeria to exempt it from a ban on sugar exports imposed in mid-March. Hoxha says Care tried to buy vegetable oil from Turkey but had been unable to do so. The next few months, then, could be challenging, and hopes for the holy month are decidedly low. “This will be one of the most difficult Ramadans that Lebanon has faced,” says Hoxha. “We thought it was last year. We thought a year before that. But this one will be particularly difficult.” The worst drought for four decades; hunger so widespread that famine could develop within months; a resurgence in violence by jihadi terrorists seeking to overthrow the fragile government: even before Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine on 24 February, Somalia had more than enough on its plate. Now, with the invasion paralysing the breadbasket of the world, the east African country is having to contend with yet another challenge: the skyrocketing price of staple goods. “A week ago, the 20-litre jerrycan of cooking oil was $25, today it’s about $50 [£38]. A litre of gasoline was $0.64 and today it runs about $1.80 – it’s crazy,” Mohamed Osman, a trader, told Agence France-Presse this week. In Somalia, where about 1.4 million children under five are thought to be acutely malnourished and more than 4 million people are reliant on emergency food aid, price increases of any size are going to have an impact. And while it does not depend as heavily as some countries on wheat imports, Somalia has many other reasons to fear the ripple effect of the war in Ukraine. Petroc Wilton, a spokesperson for the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP), says most of the agency’s food assistance in Somalia was done through cash transfers, which were highly vulnerable to market fluctuations. “Any major impact on the purchasing power of the people that we serve due to sudden price changes is a real concern, particularly in context of this very, very severe drought,” he says. The drought gripping the country has been building since October 2020, and the UN has warned that Somalia could be tipped into famine this year if the rains expected in the next few weeks aren’t plentiful enough. In 2011, the last time Somalia saw famine, almost 260,000 people are believed to have died. Before the invasion of Ukraine, food prices had already been increasing because of the drought, with livestock dying or decreasing in quality, and harvests of cereals such as sorghum well below long-term averages. “The medium-term effects of the Ukraine crisis are just an extra reason for very serious concern,” says Wilton. WFP in Somalia is “just about” to receive the last shipment of food – a delivery of yellow split peas – that left the port of Odesa before it was forced to shut, Wilton adds. “After that, we currently don’t have any visibility on further expected shipments. So yes, there is a real concern that scarcity of some of these commodities coming into Somalia and the region could drive prices up.” For decades, tens of millions of Egyptians have been able to pop to their local bakery and pick up subsidised flatbread for just a few pennies. The bread is so central to the Egyptian way of life that it is known as aish – literally, “life”. Soon, however, that fixed price could rise, as the government seeks to respond to the rise in wheat costs resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Egypt, the world’s top importer of wheat, is particularly vulnerable to the price shock, and consumers are already seeing big increases in the cost of non-subsidised goods. Last year, Egypt imported more than 70% of its wheat from either Russia or Ukraine, according to the UN, so the first challenge for the state is to seek alternative suppliers away from the Black Sea. This week, France’s agriculture minister, for one, said his country would “stand by” Egypt “to make sure it gets the wheat that it needs in the coming months”. But there are problems with most of the alternatives. Wheat from France has in the past been considered too moist. Other big exporters such as Australia or Canada bring with them significant extra costs in terms of transportation, especially in a time of high fuel prices. In an interview last month, the minister of supply, Ali El-Moselhy, implored Egyptians not to worry, saying that the country’s stocks were sufficient for at least four months and that there was “a political will and vision to maintain wheat reserves”. The local harvest, he added, according to Bloomberg, was expected to bring in 1m tonnes more than anticipated. However, with the average price per tonne of imported wheat about $100 more expensive now than last year, many also expect the government to act on the subsidised loafs. The programme had already been a target before the Ukraine invasion; last year President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi declared: “It’s not realistic that I sell 20 loaves for the same price as a cigarette … This must stop.” Now such a move seems inevitable. But in a country where about a third of the population live below the poverty line, it remains to be seen if the government is prepared for the social ramifications. “When prices jump, and poor people cannot feed their families, they will be on the streets,” warns Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, last weekend. “One thing we know about trouble in one place, it travels.

4/2/2022,"The Russian invasion of Ukraine is leading to a dramatic decline in crops planted by farmers in the country this spring, with fears for domestic and international food security. Known for its fertile soils, Ukraine is a major exporter of wheat, barley, sunflower and maize, in particular to north Africa. However, farmers and analysts have told the Guardian that planting, harvest and export have all been disrupted by a lack of fertiliser, low or no fuel supplies for tractors, closure of ports and military activity. At least one-third of the land normally used for spring crops such as maize and sunflower is likely to go unplanted. Furthermore, one-third of the normal wheat harvest from the crop planted last autumn could be lost. A small amount of wheat held in storage is reportedly being exported by rail and road via Poland and Romania, but this is a “tiny fraction” of what is normally exported via the Black Sea ports of Odesa and Mykolaiv before the invasion, said analysts.Ukrainian officials have said other export routes via the Danube River, railways and road are restricted by inadequate facilities and, in the case of railway, the difference in track and stock width between Europe and Ukraine. “I think we’re looking at potentially several months [after a cessation of the war] before export levels could be returned to normal,” said Mike Lee, who runs the Black Sea Crop Forecasts service. He said ships may struggle to get insurance cover and permission to re-enter Black Sea ports, with mines also needing to be cleared.Global cereal prices rose to a new all-time high in February due to the disruption to exports. The World Food Programme, the UN agency that provides emergency supplies to countries in conflict or experiencing natural disasters such as famines, said this week that the higher cost of food has meant it is already cutting rations.While most of Ukraine’s wheat is planted in autumn, other crops, including maize and sunflower, are planted in spring, over the coming weeks. Serhiy Ivaschuk operates a mixed dairy and arable farm with just under 7,000 hectares (17,300 acres) in the west of Ukraine in the Khmelnytskyi region, 350kms south-west of Kyiv. He said there were no hostilities in his area, but planting had been slowed this year as he had lost workers and farm vehicles to the Ukrainian military. “Our own agricultural inputs are more or less sufficient for now and the diesel stocks should be enough for the sowing. We may run short of seeds, fertilisers and crop protection products. “Before the war started, we had made several pre-payments for supplies from our credit lines. However, the logistics and supply chains are broken now, so our suppliers can’t provide us with the inputs,” he said. Ivaschuk said he had corn and wheat in storage ready to sell but was unable to export it due to logistical restrictions on using the railway, with his crops normally sent through the Polish border by rail.The restrictions on selling wheat held in storage are not just a threat to global food security, said Andrii Dykun, chair of the Ukrainian Agri Council, which represents about 1,000 farmers across the country.“In a few months there will be a new harvest, so where will we store it? Farmers also need money for fuel and fertiliser,” he said, adding that the price of diesel had doubled since the war started. Ukraine gets most of its diesel supplies from Belarus and Russia, said Dykun, but was now trying to find other sources from Europe. The Ukrainian Agribusiness Club (UCAB), one of the country’s largest agricultural associations, said farmers facing shortages of fertiliser, seeds and plant protection products were likely to have lower yields. It estimates around a third of the acreage normally used for spring crops may remain unsown this year. The wheat crop planted last autumn had favourable weather over winter, but about 40% of it is in regions with active hostilities. Svetlana Lytvyn, a UCAB analyst, said: “If we make a pessimistic assumption that it is not possible to collect these crops then Ukrainian farmers will receive 19m tonnes of grain instead of 32m tonnes [based on average recent yields] when they start harvesting in July.” In western Ukraine, another farmer who co-manages a 2,000-hectare (4,940-acre) farm near the city of Lviv, said he had started planting peas and some wheat but that they currently intended to sow “around two-thirds of what we planned a month ago”. “Cashflow and inputs are very difficult currently, with suppliers demanding prepayment for supply compared to credit last season,” he said, adding that farms in the east were likely to be sowing even less due to more difficulties with logistics, military occupation and mined areas.In the north and east of Ukraine, many farmers had tanks, military machinery and even missiles on their land. Some have described Russian soldiers occupying their farms and taking away food and equipment. “They are scared to go into the fields,” said Dykun, adding that “it looks like they [the Russian military] want to destroy our agricultural industry”.
