5/8/2022,"STORY: Sinn Fein, the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), hailed its first election win in Northern Ireland’s history on Saturday as a “defining moment” for the British-controlled region – ending a century of domination by pro-British parties. Sinn Fein Vice President Michelle O’Neill. ""Today represents a very significant moment of change. It's a defining moment for our politics and for our people.” Sinn Fein was ahead of the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party by 27 to 24 seats with two left to declare, making it the first Irish nationalist party to secure control of the assembly. O’Neill said there should now be an “honest debate” around the party’s goal of unification with the Republic of Ireland. ""Let's have a healthy debate about what our future looks like, something that's better for each and every one of us, where we all have a valued place in our society.” Party leader Mary Lou McDonald said she expects O’Neill to be appointed First Minister. ""This is a time for grown-up, sensible, partnership politics. That's what people want and we look forward to an executive being established. I look forward to Michelle O'Neill being nominated as First Minister to lead from the front."" While the largest party has the right to put forward a candidate for First Minister of the region's compulsory power-sharing government, disagreements with the DUP mean such an appointment could be months away. The Sinn Fein victory will not change the region's status, as the referendum required to leave the United Kingdom is at the discretion of the British government and likely years away. The party was long shunned by the political establishment on both sides of the Irish border for its links to IRA violence during three decades of fighting over Northern Ireland’s place within the UK. Since a 1998 peace deal, it has reinvented itself to become the most popular party in the Republic of Ireland where it has carved out a successful base by campaigning on everyday issues such as the cost of living and healthcare.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Sinn Fein celebrates win in 'defining election',https://news.yahoo.com/sinn-fein-celebrates-win-defining-201611160.html
5/8/2022,"Senator Cruz sparred with reporters over the leak of the SCOTUS draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade. The Texas Republican continues to suggest that the culprit was likely a ""left-wing law clerk."" Chief Justice Roberts earlier this week directed the marshal to launch an internal probe into the leak. Sen. Ted Cruz on Friday sparred with reporters on Capitol Hill over who leaked the Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade, with the conservative lawmaker alleging that a ""left-wing law clerk"" was the culprit. During the conversation, the Texas Republican leaned on earlier theories that he espoused while on television earlier this week, where he told Fox Business host Stuart Varney that ""some left-wing presumably law clerk wanted to put political pressure on the five justices"" that made up the majority in the far-reaching draft decision paving the way for a multitude of states to outlaw abortion. Cruz said at the time that ""if that left-wing law clerk succeeds"" in convincing any of the justices to change their final vote — which is not expected until the summer — then it would be ""the most grotesque politicization of the Supreme Court in the history of our nation."" Despite Cruz's inability to verify the identity of the culprit, he has continued to state that it was a liberal individual. The back-and-forth over the issue continued on Friday, where Cruz contended that the intent of the leak was clear. ""Senator, why do you think you know this was a liberal clerk who leaked this? Do you have information that suggests that?"" a reporter asked Cruz, which was captured on video. He responded: ""Because I'm not a moron. Because I live on planet Earth ... because this is obviously an attempt from someone who is unhappy about the direction the court is going, to put political pressure on the justices to change their outcome. That is the only reason this gets leaked, and you know that. Come on, you're a reporter in Washington, DC."" —The Hill (@thehill) May 6, 2022 The reporter then suggested that one of the justices may have changed their views since the draft decision — with a conservative potentially leaking the document because ""they supported the original decision"" and want ""to lock them back in."" ""That's a completely reasonable scenario, isn't it?"" the reporter asked Cruz. The senator seemingly mocked such a scenario: ""I find that ludicrous. But if it's the case, maybe you'll win a Pulitzer (Prize) for that."" The reporter continued to ask for proof of the identity of the culprit. ""Well you're saying you have no evidence,"" the reporter told Cruz. ""I think it's obvious what's going on here. And we've all seen leaks often enough in this town, just not at the Supreme Court,"" the senator responded. Cruz went on to say that he wanted to see the leaker ""prosecuted"" and felt that the individual ""should go to jail for a very long time."" Chief Justice John Roberts — who earlier this week directed the marshal of the Supreme Court to launch an investigation into the leak — said on Thursday that the incident was ""absolutely appalling."" Since the draft opinion was published by Politico, the revelation has rocked the country, amplifying fissures on the subject from Democratic congressional leaders and left-leaning organizations who want to codify Roe into law to the 2024 Republican presidential aspirants and grassroots activists who have fought to eliminate the procedure for years.

5/8/2022,"(Reuters) -Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that there was hostile rhetoric coming out of Poland, and that Warsaw could be ""a source of threat"". Poland has led calls for the EU to toughen sanctions and for the Western NATO alliance to arm Ukraine as it tries to resist Russian forces that have poured into its east. Stanislaw Zaryn, a spokesman for the Polish security services, said that Russia has been conducting a coordinated disinformation campaign against Poland for several days, including suggestions it could be a threat to Ukraine's territorial integrity. ""The aim of Russian actions is to create distrust between Poland and Ukraine, as well as to slander Poland and present it as a dangerous country generating conflicts in Eastern Europe,"" he wrote in an emailed comment. Polish Environment and Climate Minister Anna Moskwa said on Monday that ""Poland is proud to be on Putin's list of unfriendly countries.""
