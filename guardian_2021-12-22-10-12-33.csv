12/22/2021,"The case of a young Colorado truck driver sentenced to 110 years in prison over his role in a fatal collision has prompted widespread calls for leniency and fueled criticism of the US justice system. On Tuesday, the Colorado district attorney whose office prosecuted the case asked the court to reconsider the sentence of Rogel Aguilera-Mederos, 26, following the backlash over a punishment that’s been called unduly harsh.  Aguilera-Mederos was convicted in October of vehicular homicide and other charges related to a deadly crash in April 2019, which occurred while he was hauling lumber in the Rocky Mountain foothills. He has said he was descending a steep portion of the highway when the brakes on his semi-trailer failed, leading to a multi-vehicle pileup and four deaths. The judge in the case has said he was obligated to give Aguilera-Mederos the lengthy sentence based on minimum sentencing laws for the charges, prompting further criticism of the criminal justice system. . More than 4.5 million people have signed a petition calling for Colorado’s governor, Jared Polis, to grant clemency to Aguilera-Mederos or commute his sentence. Meanwhile, truckers and civil rights groups have expressed outrage over the sentence. “It is a stark miscarriage of justice,” said Domingo Garcia, the president of the League of United Latin American Citizens (Lulac). “Here’s a man with no prior criminal record who went to work to feed his family. The brakes go out on his truck. It was a terrible accident. He’s given 110 years for the first crime he’s ever committed, a crime that was not intentional.” Lulac sent a letter to Polis on behalf of Aguilera-Mederos, a Cuban immigrant, requesting a pardon or a reduction of his sentence. Aguilera-Mederos’ lawyer has filed a clemency petition to the governor. Aguilera-Mederos’s truck plowed into vehicles that had slowed because of another wreck in the Denver suburb of Lakewood, leading to a chain-reaction collision involving 28 vehicles that ruptured gas tanks and caused a fireball that consumed vehicles and melted parts of the highway. The crash killed Miguel Angel Lamas Arellano, 24, William Bailey, 67, Doyle Harrison, 61, and Stanley Politano, 69. Prosecutors argued that Aguilera-Mederos could have used a runaway ramp alongside the interstate, which is designed to safely stop vehicles that have lost the function of their brakes. But, Aguilera-Mederos testified that he was struggling to avoid traffic and to shift his truck into lower gear to slow it down. Alexis King, the district attorney whose office prosecuted the case, told the Denver Post that Aguilera-Mederos didn’t accept efforts to negotiate a plea deal, and that the convictions recognized the harm caused to victims of the crash. Under the reconsideration motion filed by the district attorney, the court can modify the sentence and go below the mandatory minimum, said Ann England, who teaches in the criminal defense clinic at the University of Colorado law school. The judge in the case, Bruce Jones, had said the sentence was the mandatory minimum term required under state law, but that a lesser punishment would be appropriate. Mandatory minimum sentencing laws required that sentences on 27 counts of vehicular assault, assault, reckless driving and other charges run consecutively. “I will state that if I had the discretion, it would not be my sentence,” he said. Mandatory minimum sentences have helped to drive mass incarceration and over-incarceration in Colorado and the US, England said. “I think people should be asking why we have these mandatory minimum prison sentences,” England said. Mandatory minimum sentencing takes the discretion out of the courts, and moves the balance of power from the court to the prosecutor, she said. This case, England added, is “a condemnation of the way the system works and the way the mandatory sentencing works”. The ACLU of Colorado has condemned the sentence and supports efforts to get the governor to take up the case, said Mark Silverstein, the legal director of the ACLU of Colorado. “The sentence is extraordinary especially in light of facts of this particular case,” Silverstein said. “It underscores the problems with the criminal justice system.” At Aguilera-Mederos’ sentencing, relatives of those killed in the collision said he should serve time for the crimes. Duane Bailey, the brother of William Bailey, asked the judge to sentence Aguilera-Mederos to at least 20 years, the Post reported. “He made a deliberate and intentional decision that his life was more important than everyone else on the road that day,” he said.Aguilera-Mederos wept as he apologized to the victims’ families at his sentencing. He asked for their forgiveness. “I am not a murderer. I am not a killer. When I look at my charges, we are talking about a murderer, which is not me,” he said. “I have never thought about hurting anybody in my entire life.” The Associated Press contributed reporting",News/US news,‘Miscarriage of justice’: outcry after Colorado trucker given 110 years for fatal accident,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/21/colorado-trucker-110-years-in-prison-accident
12/22/2021,"Romanian researchers have called on academic publishers to remove Elena Ceaușescu’s name from almost two dozen scientific papers and books fraudulently published as her work, more than 30 years after the wife of the former communist dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu was executed. Elena Ceaușescu was celebrated by state propaganda under her husband’s regime as a world-famous chemistry researcher, despite having no credible qualifications. The researchers say some of her work is still being cited and accessed, even though she was barely literate in science and unable to recognise basic formulas taught to first-year chemistry students.  They also want Ceaușescu’s honorary titles, awards and PhD to be revoked, and for institutions that honoured her – including the UK’s Royal Society of Chemistry and the Polytechnic of Central London (now the University of Westminster) – to withdraw recognition and acknowledge that her scientific career was bogus. Her PhD was never retracted in Romania, even though it was widely known she did not write it. Chris Isloi, a neuroscience and psychology researcher based in London, and Andrei Dumbravă, a doctor and senior lecturer at the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University in Iași, are leading the call to have the scientific record corrected. But Isloi says it is proving difficult “since no academic publishers ever wrote their publishing guidelines anticipating an author might be a communist dictator’s illiterate wife”. The Ceaușescus were executed on Christmas Day 1989 after Romania’s attempt to follow the other countries of eastern Europe in a peaceful overthrow of their regimes descended into bloodshed that ultimately allowed former communists to retain power under the guise of democracy. Elena Ceaușescu’s claim to scientific status was driven by her own desire for prestige and Romania’s curious position as the communist state most indulged by the west, despite the crushing brutality of the regime. Nicolae Ceaușescu came to power in 1965 and won praise in the west for opposing the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia three years later. In 1969, Richard Nixon visited Bucharest, the first US president to set foot in a communist country. Ceaușescu was invited to the White House in 1970 and 1978, and in the same year was the first communist head of state to visit London. Margaret Thatcher, herself a qualified chemist, visited Bucharest in 1975 as opposition leader and was received by the Ceaușescus, then met them again on the 1978 visit, a year before her first election victory. But at home he drove the Romanian economy into the ground, presided over an appalling human rights record, cut funding for science and medicine, and constructed a shameless personality cult around himself. “They were hard times,” Dumbravă says. “It’s always complicated to tell the whole story for people who never experienced any kind of totalitarianism. “It was a world in which everything was dictated to you,” he said. “The efforts of the Ceaușescus to pay off foreign debt meant they wanted to avoid any imports which required currency … Everything from oranges to bananas disappeared … And everything was under strict control. You could not sacrifice a cow in your village. It was illegal. You could go to prison if you got caught with some meat.” Isloi believes the Ceaușescus’ craving for international recognition and legitimacy was the reason Elena’s scientific credentials were raised to such heights, but her connection to chemistry research began well before Nicolae came to power. Her biographer Lavinia Betea, a professor and historian at the University of Arad, says holding the title of scientist legitimised Nicolae Ceaușescu’s “rise as a leader of the intellectual elite”. “The Ceaușescus never needed money again after Nicolae Ceaușescu was appointed general secretary of the Communist party in 1965,” Betea says. “All their expenses for food, clothes and leisure were taken care of. However, the constitutions of communist countries stipulated that citizens had both a right and an obligation to work. As the wife of the most powerful politician in the country, Elena Ceaușescu wanted to portray herself as a role model, worthy of being next to the ‘great political leader’, her husband. She wouldn’t hear of having just any job. As communism prized science as a force for industrial production, and being an intellectual had also been valued when she had been younger, a job as a scientist would work well with being the first [female] comrade of the country.” Elena Ceaușescu was born to a family of farmers and traders in 1916, according to her biography in the Romanian national archives. She attended night school at the Polytechnic Institute in Bucharest for seven years from 1950, and after her graduation went to work at the National Institute for Research and Development in Chemistry and Petrochemistry (ICECHIM), in the department working on elastomers – a type of polymer. Dumbravă says this is probably why she “specialised” in polymer research in her academic publications. “It was just a matter of chance,” he says. “Before she got her ‘PhD’, and before she got her bachelor of science ‘degree’ in chemistry, she was an unskilled worker in the institute, under the supervision of the person who had most worked on her PhD.” In his book Kiss the Hand You Cannot Bite: the Rise and Fall of the Ceaușescus, Edward Behr writes: “There is no record of her chemistry degree in advance of her doctorate … but by 1960 she had a full-time job as a researcher at the Chemical Institute (ICECHIM), and by 1965 she had become its director. “Mircea Corciovei, a scientist at ICECHIM … recalled that ‘in her [Ceaușescu’s] new position it was very difficult to talk to her. She gave orders, she wanted no arguments’,” Behr writes. “It was impossible for him to discover the extent of her knowledge of chemistry, for she never discussed the scientific aspects of the institute’s work, ‘concerning herself only with political and administrative matters’ … Corciovei discovered she didn’t know what a chromatograph was, and didn’t recognise the formula for sulphuric acid – H2SO4 – taught to first-year chemistry students.” The book describes how in 1967, when Ceaușescu was due to appear before a board of examiners to defend her chemistry doctorate while she was still working at ICECHIM, Corciovei tried to attend – such events were open to the public by law and university tradition. But when Corciovei showed up, the door was locked. The session had occurred in camera. Ceaușescu’s scientific reputation may have had the full resources of the Romanian state behind it, but it could not have reached international proportions without the help of western publications, institutions and political leaders. “Her international fame was supported by forcing Romanian chemists to write papers, some of which were published in international journals, as well as a book that was translated in English and published by Pergamon Press, a widely known British academic publisher,” Isloi says. That book – based on Ceaușescu’s PhD – was published by Pergamon under the title Stereospecific Polymerization of Isoprene and carries a foreword by the Nobel prize-winning British chemist Dorothy Hodgkin, who wrote: “I am not equipped myself with enough technical knowledge of the field of this work to give a critical scientific evaluation of its contents. “But even a necessarily brief reading makes one think that the field of research surveyed by the author is vast and recent.” Pergamon, which was owned by Robert Maxwell, also published hagiographic biographies of several eastern bloc leaders, including one on the Romanian dictator titled: Nicolae Ceaușescu: Builder of Modern Romania and International Statesman (1983). In 1991, a few months before his death, Maxwell sold Pergamon to the academic publishing giant Elsevier, where Ceaușescu’s two books are still available. Her work is also available through the publishers Taylor & Francis and Wiley. Journal articles under her name appeared in publications such as the Journal of Macromolecular Science and the now discontinued Journal of Molecular Catalysis. Ceaușescu’s reputation was also promoted by Romanian officials who pushed for recognition from respected institutions in the west. Dumbravă says she had a “childish desire” to be showered with gifts from around the world as a sign of her prestige. Ion Mihai Pacepa, the former head of Romania’s intelligence service, who defected in 1978, wrote in his 1987 book Red Horizons that Ceaușescu demanded he arrange for universities in New York and Washington to award her honorary titles. “I tried my best to explain that the American president did not have the same power that the Romanian did,” Pacepa wrote. “The only result, however, was Elena’s wrath.” Dennis Deletant, a historian and emeritus professor of Romanian studies at University College London, says in 1978 he was approached by the principal of London University, who told him Romanian diplomats had been trying to get Ceaușescu an honorary title ahead of her state visit in June of that year. Deletant was asked whether this was a wise decision. He says: “The Romanian embassy in London made strenuous efforts to persuade certain British academic institutions to recognise Elena’s ‘scientific achievements’– she was trumpeted in the Romanian press as ‘a scientist of world renown’, even though her doctorate was the work, I was reliably informed by Romanian sources, of a professor at the University of Iași. “I was invited by the principal of London University to discuss with him the grounds for the award of an honorary doctorate to Elena,” Deletant says. “I expressed a strong opposition to such a step.” An emissary from the Romanian Academy was also sent to plead Ceaușescu’s case for recognition by the Royal Society, the oldest national scientific society in the world. Deletant’s wife, Andrea, who taught Romanian at Bradford University, acted as interpreter at a meeting with the society’s president, the Nobel prize-winning chemist Alexander Todd. “After giving the emissary generous hospitality, in which alcohol played a significant part, Professor Todd asked the emissary in all frankness whether Elena deserved an honour from the society,” Deletant says. “The answer he received was no.” Both the University of London and the Royal Society rejected the Romanian requests. The Romanian embassy then turned to the Royal Society of Chemistry, which made Elena an honorary fellow, and the Polytechnic of Central London, which gave her the title of honorary professor. Neither organisation responded to a request for comment on the call to revoke Ceaușescu’s credentials. Her biographer Betea says it is important that those outside Romania share responsibility for the legitimisation of Ceaușescu. “Her first ‘recognitions’ came from France and the United States, before entering the Romanian Academy,” Betea says. “Can you excuse the interests of those who did not live in a communist dictatorship, and blame only those in the country? Or just her? That’s not fair, in my opinion. “Obviously, everyone knew she was an imposter. Those who gave her titles or pressured others to do so … are guilty of having contributed to an intellectual imposture of colossal proportions. “Those who took part in the deception were not penalised. Without them, those like Elena Ceaușescu would not have existed as a ‘world-renowned scientist’.” Professor Mircea Teodorescu from the Polytechnic University of Bucharest’s Department of Bioresources and Polymer Science, co-authored papers with Elena Ceaușescu between 1984 and 1989. He is part of the push to have her name retracted from scientific works. At the time, Teodorescu was a young assistant professor with a research laboratory in ICECHIM’s rubber department. “The whole scientific output of this department had to have Elena Ceaușescu as the first author, because of the orders of the Communist party,” Teodorescu says. “This included all joint projects with researchers from other institutions, like me and other colleagues of mine. I knew from the very beginning that all papers resulted from these joint projects would have Elena Ceaușescu as the first author, but I accepted the situation due to the location of the laboratory and also because the projects I participated in involved high-quality scientific research which offered me the opportunity to learn a lot and gain research expertise.” Teodorescu wants the works on which she was the sole author withdrawn and her name removed where she was a co-author. The science in those papers was sound, Teodorescu says – it’s just that Ceaușescu had no involvement in it. “In fact, I believe that she did not even read those works because I very much doubt she had the ability to understand them,” he says. “I consider that it is a moral issue to correct this.” In their letter to Elsevier, sent on 10 December, Teodorescu, Isloi, Dumbravă and their co-authors call Ceaușescu’s behaviour “a ruthless act of intellectual misappropriation”. “In the name of the self-correcting nature of science, as well as the hard-earned Romanian democracy, we ask that you consider retracting the titles bearing her name, as her authorship on these works is not only fraudulent, but an offense to Romanian anti-communist protesters who were killed during the Romanian Revolution, as well as every Romanian scientist who has ever done honest work. “We are well aware that these titles have ended up in your catalogue through no fault of your own. However, we consider this correction of the scientific record to be crucial.” Similar requests have been sent to Wiley and to Taylor & Francis. All the publishers have guidelines stating that false claims of authorship and plagiarism are grounds for retraction. A spokesperson for Wiley said: “We take all allegations of authorship abuse very seriously and thank the individuals who brought this to our attention. “Since receiving their letter, we have quickly initiated an investigation into four articles in Acta Polymerica, a journal which was discontinued in 2003, in accordance with industry standards set forward by the Committee on Publication Ethics.” Elsevier and Taylor & Francis did not respond to a request for comment. The co-authors are also calling for 36 patents registered under Elena Ceaușescu’s name with the European Patent Office to be retracted.ICECHIM’s website still lists her as a former general manager, but says nothing about her dark history, harsh cuts to scientific funding or lack of credentials. Its current general manager, Mihaela Doni, said: “The period of 1970-1980, in which Elena Ceaușescu held the position of the institute manager, cannot be removed or permanently erased from the history of this institution. “Our institute, as it is now, has no [qualification] in determining whether Elena Ceaușescu would have asked to be the co-author of some scientific works to which she did not contribute, and even more, to ask the publishers to withdraw her name from the published works,” she said. “The only ones who are entitled to do this are the co-authors themselves.” Isloi says Ceaușescu’s impact on science in Romania persists. “In Romanian academia, plagiarism is rampant, as is nepotism,” he says. “Sloppy science is ubiquitous, [much of it] a consequence of Elena Ceaușescu’s nefarious and outsized influence in the 70s and 80s.” Betea says Ceaușescu is now perceived less harshly than when she was alive. There’s a certain collective guilt over her hasty trial and execution, she says. But her fraud had a lasting impact on politics and science. This month, Romania’s minister of innovation resigned after an investigation found significant irregularities on his résumé and evidence he plagiarised from an academic paper. “Being enrolled as a student in a private university, and paying to have your own books or articles published in order to advance your academic career, is usually associated with Elena Ceaușescu’s model,” Betea says. “As is the Romanian politicians’ objective of having academic titles or PhDs, which is looked upon as a consequence of the obsession that the Ceaușescus had of embodying both political and scientific figures.”",News/World news,‘A moral issue to correct’: the long tail of Elena Ceaușescu’s fraudulent scientific work ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/a-moral-issue-to-correct-the-long-tail-of-elena-ceausescus-fraudulent-scientific-work
12/22/2021,"GPs in New South Wales have been left scrambling less than a week before Christmas after the state health department told them they will now be responsible for the management of Covid patients in the community. On Friday NSW Health informed GPs through the state’s 10 primary health networks that there is a new state-wide approach for the management of low-risk Covid-positive patients, effective immediately. It came as NSW hit another Covid record on Wednesday, reporting 3,763 new cases.  Each region of NSW is managed by a different primary health network, which collaborate with general practitioners and other health professionals to support and manage the health workforce, and to provide care to patients in that region. A directive sent to health workers from the Nepean Blue Mountains primary health network said low-risk Covid-19 patients “will be ‘self-managed’ and will receive information via SMS from NSW Health about managing any mild symptoms”. “NSW Health has announced that from today there will be a new state-wide approach for the management of low-risk Covid-19 positive patients,” the statement said. “Patients who have been identified to self-manage at home will be advised to contact their GP or a dedicated Covid-19 service for an initial assessment and continued care.” “Patients who are self-managed will require a GP to complete their de-isolation.” De-isolation means permission to leave isolation, which requires medical clearance for people with confirmed Covid-19, including those who are fully vaccinated. An urgent meeting was held on Tuesday night by the health network with GPs who are distressed about how to manage Covid patients at such short notice. One Sydney clinician told Guardian Australia that while GPs knew such a move was on the cards, they assumed the government would give them more notice before implementing it, along with additional support and resources. “We were told the week before Christmas, when already many staff are already on leave, with no planning and no protocols in place,” she said. “An urgent meeting is being held so we can be informed how the hell we are supposed to manage this.” Low-risk patients in NSW are considered to be those aged three months to 50 years old, those who have received two or more doses of an approved Covid-19 vaccine, those who are not identified as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders, who are not pregnant, and do not have any specified chronic conditions are deemed at low risk of hospitalisation. The president of the NSW branch of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Danielle McMullen, who is a GP, said most of the low-risk patients would have minimal symptoms. “But many will have questions and symptoms, and will want support from their GP and there is just not enough flexible funding, support or notice to recognise the pressure and impact this announcement has on general practice,” she said. “It is the GP who talks to these patients and assesses symptoms, and who talks through their worries about getting medicines delivered.” McMullen said she was shocked there was no additional funding offered to GP practices. “We need more flexible funding offered to general practices so they can field the calls that will come and have them handled by the most appropriate staff member,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “So that might be funding for more reception staff or clinic nurses. But those staff, and GPs, are exhausted, broken and were looking forward to trying to get a bit of a break. This additional work has come on top of ramping up boosters and managing vaccinations including for children. “We are all feeling the pinch of these increased Covid numbers and it’s not easy for anyone in health. But general practice has been thrown this at the last minute and we were not expecting it to come the week before Christmas. “Next year is also going to be a challenge with high Covid numbers, boosters and kids aged 5 to 11 eligible for vaccines, and general practice just need more support and recognition.”",News/Australia news,‘How the hell are we supposed to manage this?’: GPs in NSW left scrambling after new Covid order,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/22/how-the-hell-are-we-supposed-to-manage-this-gps-in-nsw-left-scrambling-after-new-covid-order
12/22/2021,"The holiday season at the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, America’s busiest shipping complex, has always been hectic. But 2021 is a year unlike any other.  A pandemic-induced buying boom and supply chain crisis led to an unprecedented backlog of ships lingering offshore and towering stacks of colorful containers clogging the entirety of the dockyard. Inside the port, thousands of workers are laboring around the clock to unload these containers one by one, sending the televisions, bicycles, medical supplies and more that they contain out to trains and waiting truckers, whose rigs stretch into nearby residential neighborhoods. The goods eventually make their way to warehouses and stores and into the arms of eager consumers. “It’s like being on a freeway in traffic”, Danny Miranda, the president of ​​ILWU Local 94, the union that represents dockworkers, said of the port complex. “There’s nowhere to go. Every space is being utilized.” The frantic holiday season caps an unprecedented year for the port. Climbing consumer sales, worker shortages and the slowdown of major transportation hubs during the pandemic created a crisis in the global supply chain, leading to increasing costs and shortages of goods and containers. In June, the Los Angeles port became the first in the western hemisphere to process 10m container units in a 12‑month period. Month after month, the complex has regularly seen record-breaking numbers of cargo ships stuck waiting in nearby waters. The backlog, which left some ships idling in the waters outside the ports for weeks, churning out pollutants, is creating challenges for consumers and retailers alike, particularly amid the holiday season. “The last quarter of the year is always busy. You get out of the summer, bathing suits and lawn chairs and you get into the normal Christmas flow of cargo,” said Miranda, who started working at the port in 1978. “Never before have we had this much cargo come to our port in my experience.” Local officials and the Biden administration are working to reduce the backlog, including moving to 24/7 operations. But with a shortage of truck drivers to transport the goods and warehouse space to hold them, a return to normal levels of traffic is still far. As the pandemic took hold in the US, it brought lockdowns and restricted access to services, which sent consumer spending on goods surging. Americans are continuing to spend significantly more on goods than ever before and the supply chain is struggling to keep up. “Americans are buying 20-25% more containers from China. If you have a system that is designed to grow between 2-4% and you ask it to grow overnight by 25% … It’s not feasible,” Edward Renwick, vice-president of the Los Angeles board of harbor commissioners, said at a recent board meeting. The increased consumer demand, along with supply chain issues and a steady backlog of ships outside the ports which together move 40% of container imports in the US – are certain to affect holiday shopping this year. Experts expect to see shortages of items such as bicycles, toys and personal electronics and long delays for home appliances. “I think there’s gonna be quite a few things that are not going to be available for Christmas,” said Bill Michels, vice-president of operations, Americas at Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply. “I don’t think people will be able to get the kinds of gifts they were intending to get. There’s gonna be less choices.” Retailers have encouraged consumers to buy early this holiday season. Meanwhile, the port complex has been working for months to address the backlog, teaming up with the Biden administration to find solutions, expanding working hours, pushing companies to clear out empty containers more quickly and securing additional storage space. In the early days of the pandemic, the ports were almost at a standstill, Miranda recalled, as imports slowed dramatically with Covid-19, creating supply chain issues around the world. Infections, too, slowed things; at one point earlier this year, before the widespread availability of vaccines, just over 5% of the 15,000 dockworkers at the two ports were infected with the coronavirus. Twenty-two workers have died of Covid over the course of the pandemic. “The pandemic created a lot of different things. People want their next day delivery. Amazon created that model and now we’re all stuck with it,” Miranda said. “People stayed home bunkered down during the pandemic and started utilizing online shopping. That’s where I think it started.” Port employees are moving more cargo than the complex has seen in more than a century of operation. Marine terminals are operating above 100% capacity to handle the surge, Gene Seroka, the LA port executive director, said at a recent meeting of the Los Angeles board of harbor commissioners. “There is no one lever that we’re gonna pull that simply gets all this cargo moving out of anchor as quickly as anyone would like,” Seroka said. “It’s all of these succinct efforts in unison that will continue to free up our docks to move more cargo.” Reducing the backlog at the port complex will ultimately require more truck drivers, experts warn, and a decrease in consumer demand. America needs about 80,000 more drivers than it currently has, according to the industry’s main trade body – a shortage fueled by low pay, long hours and challenging work conditions. California has increased the weight of loads truck drivers are allowed to carry on state highways and expanded the department of motor vehicles’ capacity to hand out commercial licenses. But without significantly more drivers to transport goods, the backlog will remain, said Katheryn Russ, an economics professor at UC Davis. “The only thing that will solve this, is having more truckers,” Russ said. “The most effective thing [would be] a boost in trucking wages and that lies with the trucking companies.” Supply chain issues can also serve as a wakeup call for consumers to consider their buying behavior, Russ said. “It gives me a reminder of the excess in my daily life,” she said. “That’s not the case for everybody but for a lot of us, we have too much stuff, so it’s a great reminder of how we can be gentler to the environment.” Miranda and port officials are hopeful that the $1.2bn infrastructure bill recently signed by Joe Biden will help alleviate long-term issues, with $17bn set to go to ports. Investments in the rail industry will also expand capacity, which will allow goods to move out more quickly. But in the meantime, the best approach to eliminate supply chain shortages, Russ said, is mitigating the spread of Covid-19, increasing the availability of rapid testing and resolving the pandemic. “Everyone who is complaining about supply chain shortages, whether it’s top of the government or people on the street doing the shopping, we should all be thinking what can we do to stop the pandemic,” she said. “There are things we can all do: masks, we can wash our hands, we can get vaccinated. “Those are all things we, as individuals, can do and should do as a patriotic duty to help the world to mitigate the virus and that will help our economy and prevent these supply chain related shortages.”",News/Business,‘Like a freeway in traffic’: America’s busiest ports choked by a pandemic holiday,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/21/inside-americas-busiest-port-during-holidays
12/22/2021,"Agingerbread White House is coated in pristine icing and decorated with tiny wreaths, surrounded by miniature fire, gas and police stations, a grocery store, post office, warehouse and school, complete with yellow bus. This twee vision of a virus-free world, produced by White House pastry chefs, formed an incongruous backdrop on Tuesday as Joe Biden strode into the state dining room to deliver something akin to a wartime address.  Gloom, fear and fatigue stalk the land again. The Omicron variant has sent coronavirus cases spiralling across the US, forcing a new round of business closures. A long queue of people snakes around a testing site a couple of blocks from the White House. It’s a deja vu of death and despair. It also spells trouble for a president who ran on compassion and competence and promised to beat the virus, along with Donald Trump. At year’s end, Covid-19 is surging again while Biden’s legislative agenda is sagging and his approval rating is in the doldrums. It was not meant to be like this. The president, who in his January inaugural address spoke of “a winter of peril and possibility”, finds himself in another winter where peril appears to have the upper hand. He is also aware that rightwing critics are eager to portray him as a pro-lockdown, pro-mandate, joy-killing Ebenezer Scrooge. But the last thing Biden wanted to conjure on Tuesday was the grim ghost of Christmas past. Behind him were two cheerful Christmas trees adorned with photos of family and snowmen. A red ribbon was draped over the fireplace. To his left was that idyllic gingerbread display and a wreath hanging over a mirror. Biden began with his signature empathy card. “I want to start by acknowledging how tired, worried and frustrated I know you are. I know how you’re feeling. For many of you, this will be the first or even the second Christmas where you look – across the table will be an empty kitchen chair there.” But then came the Churchillian appeal for stiff upper lips: “While Covid has been a tough adversary, we’ve shown that we’re tougher – tougher because we have the power of science and vaccines that prevent illness and save lives, and tougher because of our resolve.” The unvaccinated have good reason to be concerned, he warned, but the vaccinated should celebrate Christmas as planned. Yes, they could get Covid “in large numbers” but they are protected from severe illness and death, he said. Biden announced that half a billion at-home tests will soon be available for Americans to order online for free, a development that is embarrassing for press secretary Jen Psaki, who earlier this month appeared to pooh-pooh the idea. Psaki had to eat some humble pie at Tuesday’s press briefing. But the pandemic has always been political and Omicron threatens to pour yet more fuel on those flames. David Leonhardt, a senior writer at the New York Times, observed that partisanship is the biggest factor determining vaccination rates. “If Democratic voters made up their own country, it would be one of the world’s most vaccinated, with more than 91 percent of adults having received at least one shot,” Leonhardt wrote. “Only about 60 percent of Republican adults have done so. This vaccination gap has created a huge gap in death rates, one that has grown sharply during the second half of the year.” It is a chilling omen for a president who, back in that inaugural address, vowed to heal wounds and unite the nation. On Tuesday he said: “The unvaccinated are responsible for their own choices. But those choices have been fuelled by dangerous misinformation on cable TV and social media. “You know, these companies and personalities are making money by peddling lies and allowing misinformation that can kill their own customers and their own supporters. It’s wrong, it’s immoral. I call on the purveyors of these lies and misinformation to stop it. Stop it now.” In addition, Biden gave a rare shout out to “the prior administration” for the speedy development of vaccines with the scientific community. Biden finished with another rallying cry: “I know you’re tired and I know you’re frustrated. We all want this to be over. But we’re still in it, and this is a critical moment … We’re ready. We’ll get through this’.” Unlike Barack Obama, Biden does not seem likely to hold an end-of-year press conference, but he did take a few questions from reporters. Several naturally focused on Joe Manchin, the senator from West Virginia who has rudely announced that he will not support Biden’s Build Back Better legislation after all. It was a devastating blow to a Senate veteran who campaigned on his ability to cut deals. But Biden, who has Irish ancestry, quipped: “Some people think maybe I’m not Irish because I don’t hold a grudge. Look, I want to get things done. I still think there’s a possibility of getting Build Back Better done. He added: “Senator Manchin and I are going to get something done.” In the world of romantic comedies and festive movies, it would have been the cue for Trump and Manchin to rattle down the chimney, agree to let bygones be bygones and say in chorus with Biden: “A Merry Christmas to us all. God bless us, everyone!” It is, after all, a time for miracles, and Biden may need one or two.",News/US news,‘We’re still in it’: Biden’s Covid address acknowledges battle fatigue but seeks to rally the troops,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/21/joe-biden-covid-address-fatigue
12/22/2021,"Christmas will go ahead without any curbs on socialising, Boris Johnson has confirmed, prompting warnings this could lead to tougher measures later despite tentative signs that cases have begun to plateau. The prime minister said he understood that families across England needed certainty to press ahead with Christmas plans but warned curbs could still be imposed after 25 December because of the rapid spread of the Omicron variant.  From today, the Covid self-isolation period will be cut from 10 days to seven for vaccinated people in a move that could also help save Christmas for tens of thousands of people if they get the all-clear from lateral flow tests on days 6 and 7, the government announced. The Christmas decision, which follows deep splits within the cabinet, was in contrast to moves by the Scottish and Welsh governments on Tuesday. Scotland cancelled Hogmanay street parties for tens of thousands of people, Wales announced £60 fines for employees who refuse to work from home, and both countries said sporting events would be held behind closed doors. Nicola Sturgeon had previously urged indoor mixing to be limited to three households either side of Christmas Day. Labour said that while the news about Christmas in England would be a relief to many, Johnson now appeared to be “too weak” to push any new restrictions through his cabinet if they were needed. The number of reported Covid cases across the UK fell for the third time in five days on Tuesday, raising hopes the recent surge may be starting to plateau – albeit at record high levels. There were 90,629 confirmed cases on Tuesday compared with a high of 93,045 on Friday. Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said that the recent rapid increase had slowed and numbers may now have “plateaued”. “I was pretty fed up last Thursday, but I am more optimistic tonight,” he said. “Even with all the caveats and sources of bias that might be influencing … it does give me hope.” Hunter said factors such as fewer people wishing to be tested in case it rules out Christmas gatherings with family could be at play – but none could sufficiently explain the trend of the last five days. “Looking at the rate of growth from two weeks ago, if that had continued we would have been expecting to report today something in excess of 200,000 [confirmed cases], rather than the 90,000,” he said. While he didn’t believe infections were falling, they could be stabilising, he said. “At the moment, the data looks as if it has plateaued. But there are caveats to that, that mean we still have to be somewhat cautious.” Hospitalisations are rising slightly but “the jury is still out” on whether the NHS could be overwhelmed next month, he added. In a brief video clip, Johnson said the situation with Omicron – which is highly transmissible and less responsive to vaccines – “remains extremely difficult but I also recognise that people have been waiting to hear whether their Christmas plans are going to be affected”. “So what I can say tonight is that naturally we can’t rule out any further measures after Christmas – and we’re going to keep a constant eye on the data, and we’ll do whatever it takes to protect public health. “But in view of the continuing uncertainty about several things – the severity of Omicron, uncertainty about the hospitalisation rate or the impact of the vaccine rollout or the boosters, we don’t think today that there is enough evidence to justify any tougher measures before Christmas.” He did not rule out post-Christmas curbs being announced this week but unless the data moves quickly that now seems unlikely. It is understood that any post-Christmas measures would involve regulations, requiring a vote in parliament, rather than just a change to advice. While Johnson reiterated warnings that people should be careful about Christmas plans, particularly with vulnerable relatives, some scientists said the lack of new rules carried significant risk. “This is a very risky approach and is very likely to result in the need for more stringent restrictions in the near future,” said Prof Lawrence Young, a virologist and professor of molecular oncology at the University of Warwick. “Waiting for case numbers and hospitalisations to increase is likely to be too late to suppress the spread of the Omicron variant and will subject the NHS to unprecedented pressure. A short circuit break now would have prevented more people from getting infected and from having to isolate which is now impacting many essential services.” Johnson’s announcement came after a long and divisive meeting of his top team on Monday during which the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and the education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, are understood to have warned against new measures. All have been linked with potential bids to become the next Conservative party leader, in particular following a rebellion by 100 Tory MPs over Covid curbs and a historic byelection defeat last week. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said: “Boris Johnson is too weak to get any measures to keep the country safe through his cabinet. The prime minister is focused on clinging on to his job, half his cabinet are preparing their leadership campaigns, and the country is left with no plan to deal with the imminent threat of Omicron. The government must stop arguing amongst itself, come forward with a plan, and give people and businesses clarity.”",News/Politics,"No new Covid restrictions before Christmas, Boris Johnson confirms",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/21/no-new-covid-measures-before-christmas-boris-johnson-confirms
12/22/2021,"Sexual harassment is “endemic” in universities and colleges, with one in 10 staff members saying they have experienced sexual violence in the past five years, according to a report.Women were nearly two-and-a-half times as likely to experience sexual violence as men, while staff on insecure contracts, those with disabilities, LGBTQ+, or black, Asian or minority ethnic were also at greater risk, according to a survey of nearly 4,000 staff members by the University and College Union.  Jo Grady, UCU general secretary, said there were “cultural problems” within universities stemming from a reluctance to discipline perpetrators for fear of damaging institutional reputation, especially where these are star academics who bring in large amounts of research funding. This is compounded by the prevalence of insecure contracts which make staff hesitant to report unwelcome behaviours due to anxieties about jeopardising their careers, she said. Although she acknowledged that sexual violence in the workplace wasn’t unique to the education sector, Grady said there had been particular “failures to acknowledge the prevalence of it and the scale of the problem”. “Survivors say managers are often dismissive towards those reporting sexual violence, complaints processes are hardwired to frustrate claims and non-disclosure agreements are used to silence them, forcing many to leave their employment without justice. With practices like this, it is little wonder over half don’t report their abuse at all,” she said. Of the staff members surveyed, 52% said they hadn’t disclosed their experience of sexual violence, which was defined in the report as any unwanted sexual advance, ranging from uncomfortable comments and harassment to assault and rape. This is despite 70% saying it was a pattern of behaviour rather than a one-off incident. The report warned that this is concerning because “over time, a pattern of seemingly small and innocuous acts can set the scene for physical forms of sexual violence such as sexual assault to be carried out”.The report said that survivors do not trust the complaints process, with some worrying about the implications for their careers, since 28% of those surveyed experienced sexual violence from their managers. Others simply do not believe that anything will be done, or are not aware of the reporting procedures. Some staff said they had been pressured into resolving complaints informally or asked to sign non-disclosure agreements to safeguard the institution’s reputation. One survivor interviewed for the report said that when they had attempted to raise a complaint they were told the perpetrator’s behaviour was “just the way he was”, while another said senior managers laughed about inappropriate behaviour being “just the boys”.Some respondents said uncomfortable behaviours had become normalised. One said “everyone knew that these men were ‘creepy’ and ‘sleazy’ but no one did anything”. Another added: “If they are a prof with a large grant record, you may as well forget about it.” Staff members were also unhappy with the drawn-out and complicated nature of the formal investigations process and the traumatic experience of being asked to re-tell their story on multiple occasions. They were also frustrated by universities’ reluctance to disclose the outcomes of investigations to complainants on GDPR [data protection] grounds.The chair who led the report, Prof Lesley McMillan, said it showed promising signs that “the sector is waking up to the problem” but warned that “progress is variable, and in some cases, slow or yet to begin”. A spokesperson for Universities UK said the report made for “difficult but important reading” and that it would use it to step up work with universities and the UCU.They said: “University senior management take these matters extremely seriously and universities are committed to becoming safer places to live, work and study so that no student or member of staff is subject to any form of sexual violence or misconduct. “However while progress has been made, including in encouraging survivors to come forward and report, we know – and this report further emphasises – that there is much more to do to end all forms of harassment in higher education.” A Department for Education spokesperson said the universities minister, Michelle Donelan, had written to vice-chancellors in July to stress that they must take a zero-tolerance approach to sexual violence and implement “robust procedures” to tackle it. She also set out plans to tackle the misuse of non-disclosure agreements, on which the government will provide further detail “in due course”.",News/Education,"Sexual harassment rife in UK universities, warns staff union",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/dec/22/sexual-harassment-rife-in-uk-universities-warns-staff-union
12/22/2021,"The UK’s advertising regulator has banned two promotions for “fan tokens” from Arsenal Football Club, saying they were misleading supporters over the risks of investing in cryptocurrencies. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said that the north London club was “taking advantage of consumers’ inexperience or credulity, trivialising investment in crypto assets, misleading consumers over the risk of investment and not making it clear the ‘token’ was a crypto asset”.  Arsenal said it would seek an independent review of the ruling “to seek greater clarity on the ASA’s current position”. The Arsenal ad ban was one of a number published by the regulator on Wednesday, including bans on advertisements by BT, the cider brand Kopparberg, and the online retailer THG. An increasing number of football clubs are becoming involved with cryptoassets, including Watford through shirt sponsorships from cryptocurrency trading platforms and Barcelona and Juventus which offered their own “fan tokens” or non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that serve as digital memorabilia – while proving potentially very lucrative for the clubs. However, some have faced issues given the lack of regulation of the space. Manchester City last month suspended a partnership with a cryptocurrency startup that appeared to have a minimal corporate presence. The head of the Arsenal Supporters Trust, Tim Payton, last month told the Times newspaper that football clubs should have a “greater duty-of-care responsibility toward their fans” and suggested there should be more regulation of cryptocurrencies. An Arsenal spokesperson said: “We take our responsibilities with regard to marketing to our fans very seriously. We carefully considered the communications to fans regarding our promotions and provided information regarding financial risks.” The latest ASA rulings – 25 in total – also included a ban on another crypto advert. Skrill, described as an “online wallet and money transfer service”, took advantage of consumers’ inexperience, the regulator said. BT was rapped for an advert for broadband internet which claimed to guarantee speeds of 60MB/s, after a complaint. THG, the online retailer of consumer products like makeup and protein shakes, made “misleading claims over potential discounts for hair products” on its Lookfantastic website. The regulator said that a Kopparberg radio ad broke rules because it implied that alcohol could contribute to an individual’s popularityand featured people who appeared to be under the age of 25. The ASA also named and shamed four influencers who published ads on their Instagram feeds, including for not properly disclosing they were paid for the posts – a growing problem for the regulator. They were reality TV personalities Charlotte Dawson and Chloe Ferry, the beauty blogger Jamie Genevieve and video blogger Anastasia Kingsnorth. It was the second time that Ferry has been censured within six months, after she was criticised in June for posting an ad for a company that claimed it could help customers write off up to 85% of their debts. In Marc,h the ASA warned it would crack down on influencers who broke the rules. Under the UK advertising code, paid-for endorsements must be clearly marked, typically using a hashtag such as #ad or #spon, short for advertising or sponsored. Complaints against two adverts – by the clothing retailer Jigsaw and construction machinery retailer JMAC – were upheld for objectifying women. Regulators also upheld 26 complaints that a Halloween billboard poster for Blackpool Pleasure Beach was “inappropriate and disturbing for young children” – although Norfolk Dinosaur Park avoided censure for its poster following complaints that it was too scary.",News/Media,Arsenal adverts for cryptocurrency ‘fan tokens’ banned,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/dec/22/arsenal-adverts-for-cryptocurrency-fan-tokens-banned
12/22/2021,"The Covid self-isolation period has been cut to seven days in a move that could save Christmas for thousands of people and ease mounting staff shortages. From Tuesday, new guidance will enable the 10-day self-isolation period for vaccinated people in England who have tested positive for coronavirus to be reduced by three days if they get the all-clear from lateral flow tests.  People who receive negative results from tests taken 24 hours apart on day six and day seven of their self-isolation period will no longer have to self-isolate for the full 10 days, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said. Those who leave self-isolation on or after day seven are “strongly advised” to limit close contact with other people in crowded or poorly ventilated spaces, work from home and minimise contact with anyone who is at higher risk of severe illness if infected with Covid-19, the agency added. There is no change to the guidance for unvaccinated positive cases, or unvaccinated contacts of positive cases, who are still required to self-isolate for the 10 full days after their date of exposure to the virus. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said: “We are reducing the self-isolation period from 10 days to seven if you test negative on a lateral flow test for two days running. It’s vital people keep playing their part by testing regularly and isolating if they test positive. And I urge you to get boosted now to protect yourself and those around you.” Some businesses had feared that if the rules were not relaxed then they could be crippled by mass staff absences. However, scientists and others have raised concerns, arguing that shortening the self-isolation regime could increase the likelihood of Covid spread, given lateral flow tests are not entirely reliable indicators of whether someone is infected. Analysis by the UKHSA suggests that a seven-day isolation period alongside two negative lateral flow test results has nearly the same protective effect as a 10-day isolation period without lateral flow testing. The new approach reflects the latest evidence on how long infected people transmit the virus for and will support essential public services and supply chains over the winter, while still limiting the spread of the virus, UKHSA said. The UKHSA chief executive, Dr Jenny Harries, said: “Covid-19 is spreading quickly among the population and the pace at which Omicron is transmitting may pose a risk to running our critical public services during winter. “This new guidance will help break chains of transmission and minimise the impact on lives and livelihoods. It is crucial that people carry out their lateral flow tests as the new guidance states and continue to follow public health advice.”",News/World news,Covid self-isolation cut to seven days with negative test in England,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/22/covid-self-isolation-cut-to-seven-days-for-jabbed-people-in-england
12/22/2021,"Almost 5 million families in social housing in England are facing the biggest rent hike for a decade from April amid a mounting cost of living squeeze, according to a report. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said 4.75 million families would see rent on their local authority or housing association home rise by up to 4.1%, adding to the pressure on living costs by an average £202 extra a year.  It warned the increase would coincide with significant tax rises planned by the government to come in from April and a further jump in household utility bills when Ofgem’s consumer energy price cap is raised. The Bank of England also forecasts inflation will peak at about 6% the same month, the highest level since 1992. “Rising social rents on top of these increases will be very damaging for living standards indeed,” it added. Social housing providers set rents each year within a cap calculated on the consumer price index measure of inflation for September plus 1%. While this is a cap rather than a requirement, most providers are expected to raise rents by the full amount. It comes after CPI reached 3.1% in September. The latest rise follows a decade of housing costs rising faster than incomes for those living in social accommodation, with families renting from local authorities and other providers suffering a faster increase than for those in private rented homes or owning their property. According to the report, social renters now spend 19% of their income on housing costs after housing benefit is taken into consideration, up from 15% a decade ago – equivalent to an extra £768 per year for the average family. In contrast, the share of income for private renters has remained flat over the same period, at an elevated level of 31%. Housing costs for homeowners have fallen from about 10% to 9% thanks to a drop in interest rates over the past decade. Housing benefit paid by the government will help cushion the blow for some social renters, although the thinktank warned the proportion of people receiving support from the state had dropped in recent years amid rising employment levels. Almost half of social renters do not receive housing benefit, meaning they will need to cover the biggest increase in social rent costs for a decade by themselves from April. Lindsay Judge, research director at the Resolution Foundation, said the rise would put particular pressure on the 2 million social renters who don’t receive housing benefit, but who are likely to face falling real wages, rising taxes and soaring energy bills. “While government support has helped to limit rent arrears from building up among social renters so far, raising rents to the maximum uprating would be unwise given the cost of living crunch hitting families hard this spring,” she said.",News/Business,"Five million families in England face big social housing rent hike, warns thinktank",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/22/five-million-families-in-england-face-big-social-housing-rent-hike-warns-thinktank
12/22/2021,"It’s something. The chancellor’s Omicron support package for the hospitality sector is worth £1bn, enough for Rishi Sunak to claim he listened to the cries of distress from pubs, restaurants and leisure businesses and acted. And, to be fair to him, there was applause from the main industry lobby groups. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, called it a “generous package”. It is hard, though, to escape the sense that the measures could quickly be overtaken by events. This is a limited package designed merely to catch up with the current “stealth lockdown” environment, meaning consumers’ sensible decision to tone down their partying. It would not be sufficient to cope with a ramping up of restrictions beyond plan B.  One hopes the Treasury knows as much. The focus was on parcels of grants – up to £6,000 for each premise – plus reimbursement of statutory sick pay of up to two weeks a worker for small and medium-sized employers. That’s a limited bailout from the point of view of businesses, but it does nothing for employees who would be at risk of losing their jobs in a proper lockdown. Nor, as the Resolution Foundation thinktank pointed out, does it offer support for workers on zero-hours contracts who will see their hours reduced. They have been the biggest losers during the toned-down season of socialising. The open question is what happens if heavier restrictions are introduced after Christmas. Some version of a sector-specific furlough scheme would still seem essential. Sunak has provided a holding position; it cannot be the last word on the matter. Call it a windfall from windfarms. Greencoat Capital, a fund manager that was early into renewables investment in 2009, including windfarms in the Irish Sea, is being bought by the industry giant Schroders. Or, at least, a 75% stake is changing hands in cash at an enterprise value of £358m. Greencoat’s four founders, plus a few staff, currently own the business, so that’s a very large payday for them. To keep the sellers keen, Schroders is also offering a potential three-year earn-out worth up to £120m. Not bad. For the buyer, it’s a very on-strategy transaction. Schroders’ chief executive, Peter Harrison, has been pushing hard into responsible and green investing in recent years and Greencoat is one of the fastest-growing names in the specialist sector (one of its investment trusts is a member of the FTSE 250 index). The target’s £6.7bn under management barely registers against Schroders’ £700bn, but the direction of travel is clear. One cannot say Schroders is getting an out-and-out bargain, however. Greencoat generated revenues of £38.2m last year and made pre-tax profits of £20m. Even if one assumes a one-quarter uplift this year, Schroders will be paying about 20 times earnings. That’s steep for a fund management business by traditional yardsticks. A “full, but not excessive” price, said Barclays’ analysts, and, yes, two factors probably support that generous verdict. First, with a shove from Schroders’ marketing muscle, Greencoat should be able to accelerate its push into the US; at the moment, the business is primarily a UK and continental European backer of windfarms and solar, biomass and heat projects. Second, money is shifting like never before into renewables and energy transition. Low wind speeds in Europe have been an operational problem this year but haven’t affected investment appetites one jot. Schroders is an old and canny outfit: it has probably called this one right. Well played, the Advertising Standards Authority, which seems to have opened a war against the irresponsible promotion of cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets. Last week, it ruled against a couple of big names, Coinbase and eToro. This week’s crop includes Arsenal football club, which was found to have unfairly punted a “fan token” to supporters. Arsenal’s charge-sheet from the ASA is long: exploiting consumers’ “inexperience or credulity”; trivialising investment in crypto assets; misleading consumers over investment risks; and not making it clear the “token” was a crypto asset. The club will seek an independent review, but the ASA’s attempt to bring some order to the crypto market is to be applauded. The watchdog has few teeth, but nobody else seems shocked by the rapid normalisation of high-risk speculative instruments.

12/22/2021,"In the moments before a 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck the northern California coast on Monday, roughly half a million phones began to buzz. An early-alert system managed by the US Geological Survey sent warnings out before the ground started to shake, giving residents in the sparsely populated area vital time to take cover. The earthquake brought significant shaking but minimal damage in Humboldt county, about 210 miles north-west of San Francisco, and officials said it was an excellent test of the alert-system. It was the largest magnitude quake that’s occurred since the system, known as ShakeAlert, was officially rolled out across the west coast.  “We got some reports from folks that they got up to 10 seconds’ warning before they felt shaking. That’s pretty darn good,” said Robert de Groot, a ShakeAlert coordinator with the USGS. It took 11.4 seconds for the first #ShakeAlert Message data package to be produced by @USGS. The quake was estimated at M4.5. At this level alert delivery to cell phones by @MyShakeApp, @Android, @ReadySanDiego or @QuakeAlertUSA was possible. @Cal_OES @CAGeoSurvey @USGS_Quakes pic.twitter.com/ZIDob71r0Z ShakeAlert issues warnings through a series of agencies and apps including the MyShakeApp, public wireless emergency alert systems, and the Android operating system, powered by Google. A data package is created from information provided by USGS sensors and – within seconds – shows up on phones. Some apps that provide alerts are available to download but even some who didn’t have an app on their phone were notified. Affected individuals are instructed to drop, cover, and hold on. Having extra seconds to do so can save lives. This event provided an opportunity for the scientists and system operators to test and improve ShakeAlert so it will be even better when the next big earthquake strikes. “We can run as many simulations and tests as possible but we are really going to learn the most from real earthquakes,” de Groot said. “It’s giving us the chance to use the system and learn how to do a better job of alerting people.” The earthquake occurred just after noon and was centered off the coast, near a tiny town called Petrolia that’s home to fewer than 1,000 people. The nearest population center, Eureka, is about 45 miles north. This 6.2 #Earthquake didn't seem to phase people in Northern California but it did cause some damage in this liquor store.

The Humboldt county sheriff’s office of emergency services did not issue any evacuation orders, though a few roads were closed due to rockslides. The US Geological Survey estimated economic losses of less than $10m and no fatalities. Photos showed shattered store windows, broken bottles fallen into store aisles and tiles that had fallen loose from a commercial building’s ceiling. The area last suffered an earthquake of a similar magnitude in 1993, when one person died, according to the USGS.

There have been dozens of aftershocks ranging from 2.6 to 4.5 in magnitude, according to the USGS, through Monday and Tuesday. Though the quake originated off the coast, it did not trigger a tsunami and the National Weather Service announced that there was not a threat of one. Even as alerts improve, officials emphasized how essential it is for residents and visitors to earthquake-prone areas across the west coast to be prepared. “It is one tool in a larger toolbox,” said De Groot.

12/22/2021,"The latest update about the number of Premier League players who are vaccinated against Covid-19 shows that English football is crying out for strong leadership when it comes to getting jabs in arms. The figures are infuriating. On Monday it was revealed that 16% of top-flight players remain unvaccinated. The vaccination journey has crawled along and even now, with Omicron forcing a raft of fixture postponements, some players are still refusing to do their civic duty. The willingness to digest misinformation about the vaccine on social media remains a problem, although perhaps there will be a shift in attitudes if different rules are brought in for the unvaccinated.  A two-tier system was a topic of discussion when clubs debated the disruption caused to the schedule on Monday. Proposals include unvaccinated players travelling separately to games, facing an additional check to get into stadiums and having meals away from vaccinated teammates. There will be a backlash if those rules ever come into place. There will be talk of players being blackmailed. Twitter experts will say that vaccines do not stop people catching Covid. The response is that under government guidelines unvaccinated players must isolate for 10 days if deemed a close contact of anyone who has tested positive, even if they produce negative results. It is not difficult to understand. After all at least one Premier League match was called off because unvaccinated players were isolating. This is when the sympathy for teams struggling to fulfil fixtures disappears. This, unfortunately, is the point that Thomas Tuchel failed to take into account when he was asked about vaccination rates before a heavily depleted Chelsea visit Brentford in the last eight of the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night. “You know that it’s causing an issue,” Tuchel said. “But it’s not that we have all unvaccinated infected. We have vaccinated players who are positive. I don’t want to get involved in pointing fingers and starting the hunt for non‑vaccinated people. This is a choice to make.” Tuchel, who is vaccinated, was also asked about the potential rule changes. “There can be regulations around this,” the Chelsea manager said. “You have to live with the consequences. But we cannot force people to get vaccinated. I will not change my opinion on that. And I am not the guy to comment on that. There are experts in this country, all over Europe. Ask them and ask me please about football.” Sadly Covid is the game’s dominant talking point. Chelsea, whose vaccination rate is unknown, have six players in quarantine and Tuchel could pick a very odd team against Brentford. Trevoh Chalobah and Andreas Christensen are injured, N’Golo Kanté will not be risked after his exertions during Chelsea’s goalless draw at Wolves last weekend and Tuchel could have to use untried academy players. In that context Tuchel, who was angered by the league’s decision not to call off the Wolves game, is entitled to point out that Chelsea are at risk of picking up more injuries if they have to play three games in eight days with only 14 senior outfield players available. Yet if the German is going to make a persuasive case for player safety, then he must also engage on vaccines. Tuchel has repeatedly shied away from the topic, offering a series of vague non-answers, and it was frustrating to hear him suggest that vaccines are a personal choice. We are in a pandemic. The moral and social imperative is obvious: getting vaccinated protects both the individual and wider society. As for the implications for football, unvaccinated players are clearly putting the game at risk. Their personal choice has professional consequences. Footballers cannot work from home and there is an argument that any unvaccinated player who has to quarantine as a close contact of a positive case should not be deemed a Covid absentee. Games should not have to be called off because a player trusts Instagram instead of scientists. The selfish disregard for employers, teammates, opponents and fans needs calling out. Tuchel is mistaken to leave it to Jürgen Klopp. Liverpool’s manager, who has called vaccines a moral obligation, is a leader; he knows that the personal choice line does not wash. It is a weak position to adopt and the disappointment is that Tuchel could make such an articulate argument for vaccines. Having covered him closely since January, I see Chelsea’s brilliant manager as an intelligent, funny and hugely interesting man. Football needs people such as Tuchel to speak up. It is time he realised the power of his voice.",Sport/Football,Thomas Tuchel falls short in stance on Chelsea and Covid vaccines | Jacob Steinberg,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/dec/21/thomas-tuchel-falls-short-in-stance-on-chelsea-and-covid-vaccines
12/22/2021,"Remember the name? The vast majority inside the Emirates Stadium already knew it. They even had a song prepared when Charlie Patino, an 18-year-old playmaker who has attained near-mythical status with his performances in youth football, limbered up beside the halfway line and waited for the ball to go dead. He made his entrance to rapturous applause and, 10 minutes later, had raised the roof with a smartly taken goal on his senior debut; if everything goes to plan it will be a quiz question a few years down the line and Sunderland, enterprising but well beaten, may not overly mind being the answer.  “A beautiful moment,” Mikel Arteta said of Patino’s stabbed finish from six yards, which added a fuzzy glow to a Carabao Cup quarter-final that was already well won. “He is a kid that is coming through our system, a lovely kid. He is training with us almost every week. It was a dream. As a debut here, to score in front of our fans, a special moment.” Nobody with the slightest handle on Arsenal, and especially not those immersed in the minute analysis of young prospects that abounds on social media, will have escaped the hype around Patino. Those who know best believe he can handle it and you need not go far to find informed onlookers, views gleaned from putting boots on the ground, who believe Arsenal’s academy has developed an extraordinary talent. This glimpse felt all the more precious because it will not be repeated too frequently just yet. “Now we have to cook him slowly,” Arteta said, miming the shape of a pot. If Patino requires proof that the path does not always run smoothly he need only look at Arsenal’s real matchwinner. Eddie Nketiah is another product of their system but, at 22, feels he is going stale without starts in the Premier League. He has rejected a new contract but offered a timely demonstration of his qualities here, particularly given the intrigue surrounding Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Nketiah’s hat-trick came from a cumulative range of around 15 yards, although two of those goals were flicked in quite sublimely; he has an old-school poacher’s quality that might best have fitted a top-six team two or three decades ago, but could yet have played his way back into Arsenal’s present. “He has incredible work rate, he has pace and has the smell for goals,” Arteta said. “He wants to be the best and works all the time to do that. He’s a player that has come through our system and that’s why we want to keep him.” Nketiah’s potency helped guarantee a margin of victory that was slightly harsh on Sunderland, who showed in spells why they are fighting for promotion from League One. Around 5,000 away fans had decided the epidemiological situation was no barrier to a journey south; they saw Lee Johnson’s side take pains to assert themselves, deserving the goal from Nathan Broadhead that gave Arsenal a mild headache at half-time but ultimately proving ripe to be picked off. “I thought the lads played really well in patches,” Johnson said. “It’s a massive lesson for them, the best lesson you could possibly feel.” The first part of it was handed down by Nketiah, who bundled in with his thigh after Lee Burge had done well to save Rob Holding’s free header. Sunderland had started well enough, although Elliot Embleton had struck his own bar as Arsenal turned the screw. A second goal followed when Nicolas Pépé, sharp enough despite having played only 12 minutes since the previous round of this competition, took a return pass from Cédric Soares and saw his shot deflect in off Callum Doyle. Broadhead dinked neatly past Bernd Leno after a slick move but would not complete the first half, departing with an injury. Arsenal pulled clear from there, Nketiah darting in to touch Nuno Tavares’ waist-high cross past Burge on the volley four minutes after the interval and then gorgeously backheeling in Pépé’s centre just before the hour following the winger’s nutmeg on Denver Hume. “I’m desperate to play football, every player wants to play,” Nketiah said. “All I can do is work hard and it will work itself out. As long as I play for Arsenal I’ll give my all.” Pépé’s future is beset by its own question marks, but he had one more flourish left. It may have been the most important: a step inside worked space to find Patino, who had timed his run from the edge of the box, in added time. Whether or not Pépé remains at Arsenal much longer, at least he can say he was there. “He still has a lot of competition in front of him, he is really young and he needs to go step by step,” Arteta said, again trying to cool any impatience around Patino. In time, this may resemble more of a leap.",Sport/Football,Nketiah fires hat-trick and Patino adds gloss to Arsenal’s rout of Sunderland,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/21/arsenal-sunderland-carabao-cup-quarter-final-match-report
12/22/2021,"Half a billion at-home coronavirus tests will be sent free to the American public in the fight against Omicron, Joe Biden announced on Tuesday, while pushing back against resistance to vaccine mandates by saying they are intended “not to control your life, but to save your life”. The move is part of a renewed White House effort that includes the Pentagon calling up 1,000 troops to deploy to hard-hit hospitals and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) working to expand medical capacity.  But as Covid-19 once again rages across America via the new Omicron variant, the president, speaking from the White House, did not discourage Christmas gatherings, impose vaccine mandates for domestic air travel or seek a new round of lockdowns. “I know some Americans are wondering if you can safely celebrate the holidays with your family and friends – the answer is yes, you can, if you and those you celebrate with are vaccinated, particularly if you’ve gotten your booster shot,” Biden said. The public should be “concerned” but not “panicked” about Omicron, he added. “This is not March of 2020. Two hundred million people are vaccinated. We’re prepared. We know more. We just have to stay focused.” Federal health officials said on Monday that Omicron has raced ahead of other variants and is now the dominant version in the US, accounting for three in four new infections last week. Biden, who earlier this month unveiled a winter plan to combat the pandemic dogging his political fortunes, has been forced to revise his strategy. He announced that his administration is buying 500m at-home, rapid tests this winter to be distributed for free to Americans who want them, with initial delivery starting next month. A website will enable people to order them to be delivered to their home for free. The decision follows growing pressure on the White House to make free tests more widely available. At a recent briefing, the press secretary, Jen Psaki, asked sarcastically: “Should we just send one to every American?” Critics pointed out that the UK does just that and wondered why the US could not follow suit. Biden said: “The federal government will purchase one half billion … additional at-home rapid tests with delivery starting in January. We’ll be getting these tests to Americans for free and we’ll have websites where you can get them delivered to your home.” A sixfold increase in Omicron’s share of Covid-19 infections in just one week has led to long queues at testing sites in large cities. Biden announced new federal testing sites around the country. The first will be created this week in New York, which just reported a record number of new daily cases. Biden also unveiled additional vaccination resources. Currently 73% of adult Americans are fully vaccinated. He acknowledged that breakthrough cases are inevitable. “We’ll see some vaccinated people get Covid, potentially large numbers,” he said, but noted that they are at very low risk of severe illness. He warned: “Omicron is a serious, potentially deadly business for unvaccinated people. If you’re not fully vaccinated, you have good reason to be concerned. You’re at a high risk of getting sick. And if you get sick, you’re likely to spread it to others, including friends and family, and the unvaccinated have a significantly higher risk of ending up in hospital or even dying.” The unvaccinated have an obligation to themselves, their family and their country to get the shot, the president added. “I promise you, it saves lives, and I honest to God believe it’s your patriotic duty.” He also urged parents to get their children vaccinated and said the government now has the knowledge and tools to keep schools open, even when Covid-19 cases are reported. Hospitals are battling rising Omicron hospitalisations, mostly among the unvaccinated, with some near breaking point and turning non-Covid patients away. Biden’s winter plan made more than 60 winter Covid-19 emergency response team deployments available to states. He is directing the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, to ready an additional 1,000 service members – military doctors, nurses, paramedics and other medical personnel – to deploy to hospitals during January and February, as needed. Six emergency response teams – with more than 100 clinical personnel and paramedics – are deploying to six states now: Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Arizona, New Hampshire and Vermont. This is on top of the 300 federal medical personnel that deployed in response to Omicron. In addition, Biden is instructing Fema to mobilise planning teams to work with every state and territory to assess hospital needs ahead of winter surges, and to start expanding hospital bed capacity. In his address from the state dining room, Biden condemned rightwing media personalities who spread anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. “The unvaccinated are responsible for their own choices. But those choices have been fuelled by dangerous misinformation on cable TV and social media. You know, these companies and personalities are making money by peddling lies and allowing misinformation that can kill their own customers and their own supporters. It’s wrong, it’s immoral. I call on the purveyors of these lies and misinformation to stop it. Stop it now.” He also defended vaccine mandates which have been opposed by Republican state governors in court. “My administration has put them in place not to control your life, but to save your life, and the lives of others,” he insisted. Early studies suggest the vaccinated will need a booster shot for the best chance at preventing omicron infection. Biden said: “I got my booster shot and just the other day former president Trump announced he had gotten his booster shot. It may be one of the few things he and I agree on.”",News/US news,Biden announces half a billion free home Covid tests to fight Omicron,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/21/biden-to-announce-half-a-million-free-home-covid-tests-to-fight-omicron
12/22/2021,"Securing a Covid vaccine appointment for five- to 11-year-olds is proving difficult for some parents and carers who are being told to “check again in the next few weeks” when attempting to make a booking. Earlier this month the federal government said slots could be found through its vaccine clinic finder website from 15 December, with the first appointments available from 10 January.  But when searching for appointments by postcode, many suburbs return a message stating: “Clinics are currently placing orders for the 5-11 year old vaccine. If you can’t find a suitable clinic or appointment, please check again in the next few weeks.” A University of Sydney epidemiologist, Prof Alexandra Martiniuk, said she had no luck trying to book an appointment for her six- and nine-year-old children via the HotDoc and NSW Health websites. She also could not book an appointment at GP offices she called. “They had no bookings available,” she said. “I checked again today [Tuesday] and HotDoc says bookings will start in five weeks and several GPs say to ring back later still.” Martiniuk said she was concerned booking websites would be overwhelmed once appointments do become available as people rushed to secure appointments before school returns for 2022. In Western Australia, a father living in the Perth suburb of Guildford said GPs in his area told him they had no appointment dates for five- to 11-year-olds and they were unsure of availability. “This is not isolated to my local area,” he told Guardian Australia. The father called the national Covid hotline for assistance. “Staff could not provide any clues as to when bookings would become available and just cited the January start date for administration,” he said. “Speaking to [federal health minister Greg] Hunt’s office was an exercise in frustration, with their office manager suggesting calling GPs but not citing which GPs were able to take bookings. They were unwilling to categorically state that you can’t book when asked directly.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A spokesperson for the WA health department said bookings for five- to 11-year-olds would be available “soon” through state-run clinics: “WA Health has been informed by the commonwealth that the vaccines are expected in WA within the next few weeks.” A federal health department spokesperson said the government had an agreement with Pfizer to receive a sufficient supply of the paediatric vaccine to cover all children aged five to 11 in Australia in January. “If individuals cannot find a suitable clinic or appointment, people are encouraged to check back regularly as more clinics and more appointments will be added over the coming weeks,” they said. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners president, Dr Karen Price, said the vaccine rollout to children was critical but GPs were already under pressure after vaccinating the rest of the population. “The problem we face with rolling out Covid-19 vaccines to children is that vaccinating children is a more complex job compared to adults,” Price said. “Children require more time and care, as well as space because their parents come with them, and this has to be factored in by practices planning vaccine clinics. Without appropriate funding, it will be harder for practices to get the job done and make ends meet at the end of the day. And while GPs don’t get into this career for the money, our practices need to remain viable.” The president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Omar Khorshid, said he had not been given any information about supply constraints. But he said some clinics may prefer to wait until the vaccine had been delivered and they had stock in-hand before opening bookings – and they could be waiting until after the Christmas holidays. “Practices have been able to order the paediatric vaccine for a couple of weeks now and those orders that went in by 17 December will be delivered by 7 January to be available from the 10th,” he said. “Orders in by the end of the month will be delivered by the 14th. Christmas is coming up and some practices won’t be open over the break, so practices need to factor that into how much they order. “We’ve been given no information to suggest any supply constraint, but these vaccines are only just arriving in the country so who knows, we have been given no information about how much is arriving. And with the booster program starting, the constraint may not be supply but the number of nurses available for paediatric vaccines and that will be variable across the country.”",News/Australia news,Covid vaccine bookings for children in Australia scarce as parents told to ‘check again in next few weeks’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/22/vaccine-bookings-for-children-in-australia-scarce-as-parents-told-to-check-again-in-next-few-weeks

12/22/2021,"The archbishop of Canterbury has said that people will have felt “sorrow and sadness” seeing the photograph of Downing Street staff drinking together last May because it will have reminded them of what they sacrificed. In an interview with ITV, Justin Welby hinted at his disapproval over the gathering, saying that leadership involved setting an example.  Downing Street insists that the people featured in the photograph drinking in the No 10 garden in May last year – the prime minister, his wife, Carrie, and officials – were discussing work issues and that they were complying with the lockdown rules in force at the time. However, critics argue that the picture suggests a lockdown-busting social gathering, not a work meeting, and the gathering could now be included as part of the inquiry into other No 10 events last year that allegedly broke Covid regulations. Asked what he felt when he saw the picture, Welby told ITV: “I thought about the many people who’ll look at that and remember what they were doing on that day – and the sorrow and sadness they felt on that day because of not being able to see someone, or a bereavement, or the last time they saw someone they loved.” Welby said that he was “not quick to judge people” and that he wanted to wait for the outcome of the investigation. Asked if he accepted that lack of moral authority could cost lives at a time when people needed to follow public health messages, he agreed. “There needs to be truth and integrity and the cost of leadership is that you set an example,” he said. “You lead from the front, which means you obey the rules.” Welby spoke out as it was confirmed that a police watchdog is considering a complaint that officers on duty at No 10 allowed a lockdown-busting party to go ahead in December last year. Jenny Jones, a Green party peer, asked the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) to investigate following reports that a gathering took place on 18 December last year that involved food, party games and drinking late into the night. The event is already being investigated on behalf of the prime minister by Sue Gray, a senior civil servant, as part of her wider inquiry into Downing Street events that might have broken lockdown regulations. In her letter to the IOPC, sent earlier this month, Lady Jones said that officers are on duty at Downing Street protecting the building and that part of their job involves controlling access. “If there was an unlawful gathering taking place at No 10 Downing Street, then the police must have known, and were highly likely to have played an active part in organising or facilitating the illegal gathering,” she wrote. Complaints first have to be considered by the relevant force, and the IOPC initially referred it to the Metropolitan police. The Met referred it back, and on Tuesday Jones posted a message on Twitter saying it was now being considered. However, IOPC sources said the complaint was only being assessed to decide if a full investigation is merited. The IOPC normally only triggers a full investigation in response to a complaint from someone personally adversely affected by police misconduct. The Met has refused to investigate allegations of partying at No 10 last winter, saying that normally it does not investigate breaches of lockdown rules that took place in the past, but that if “significant evidence” becomes available it will review this decision.",News/UK news,"People will feel ‘sadness’ over No 10 garden picture, says Justin Welby",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/21/people-will-feel-sadness-over-no-10-garden-picture-says-justin-welby
12/22/2021,"The Scottish Professional Football League is locked in talks with Sky Sports amid a rising sense from top‑flight clubs that a winter break, due to start on 3 January, should be brought forward after crowd restrictions were imposed by Nicola Sturgeon. Scotland’s first minister has implemented a blanket match attendance limit of just 500 from and including Boxing Day, which will have a dramatic impact on the backdrop to the televised Old Firm match at Celtic Park on 2 January. Hibernian are due to meet Heart of Midlothian, live on Sky, a day later in Edinburgh. Within hours of Sturgeon confirming her plans, Celtic stated they wanted matches to be rearranged.  A Celtic statement read: “In light of today’s announcement regarding supporters attending matches, Celtic can confirm that it has today requested that the SPFL bring forward the scheduled winter break and reschedule the fixtures affected by the regulations announced.” Hibs have echoed Celtic’s stance. “Every effort should be made to allow supporters to watch their team and the game they love,” the club said. Alan Burrows, the Motherwell chief executive, stated his belief that “we should start the winter break now”. While that is the widespread view, it is not universal. Sky’s exclusive live broadcast arrangement is crucial to the SPFL and means the subscription channel must agree to any switching of games. Sky provided no comment on its position. There is also concern within the league that there is insufficient calendar leeway to reschedule multiple matches. A fresh fixture guide must be provided by the league to clubs. Some club executives remain unconvinced stadiums will open up at even close to capacity after the initial, three‑week timeframe detailed by Sturgeon. Notably, there has been no public comment provided thus far by Rangers, who lead the Scottish Premiership. The Aberdeen manager, Stephen Glass, whose team face Hibs on Wednesday in front of an attendance likely to reach around 15,000, questioned the timing of the decision on crowd capacity. Glass said: “The bit I don’t follow the reasoning with is, why would you say this rule is really important in three or four days’ time but not tomorrow night? I don’t see the reasoning at all and I don’t see the sense in it.” In a statement, Aberdeen said: “These latest restrictions are likely to cost the club up to half a million pounds. The news this afternoon is a huge blow to all at Aberdeen FC and clubs across Scotland.” With those businesses still digesting the news from the Scottish parliament, St Mirren announced they had requested the postponement of their game against Celtic on Wednesday and the Sunday trip to Rangers because of a virus outbreak. “We have tried our utmost to fulfil the fixtures,” St Mirren said. “However, following further positive Covid cases this [Tuesday] morning we are unable to field a team for either match with a significant number of first‑team players and staff unavailable.” It was subsequently reported St Mirren’s bid had been rejected.",Sport/Football,Scottish football chiefs in talks with TV broadcaster over winter break dilemma,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/21/scottish-football-chiefs-in-talks-with-sky-over-winter-break-dilemma
12/22/2021,"Chile’s future as a greener, fairer country, depends on the success of efforts to rewrite the country’s dictatorship-era constitution, president-elect Gabriel Boric said on Tuesday. After a meeting with the delegates elected last year to rewrite the 1980 constitution which enshrined the ideological legacy of General Augusto Pinochet, Boric called for Chileans to unite behind the project.  “We all need to put our best efforts into [the constitutional process], independent of our political differences,” Boric said in Santiago. A stunning 78% of Chileans voted last year in favor of drafting a new document and another vote this year saw the election of a broadly leftwing assembly for the task. “If things go well for the convention, they will go well for Chile,” Boric said, confirming that he would respect the convention’s decision-making. The convention’s president, Elisa Loncón, an academic belonging to Chile’s Mapuche indigenous group, said that the convention would “open its doors to institutional collaborations”, but expected the body’s autonomy to remain intact. Boric won the largest majority ever recorded in a Chilean election to score a decisive victory over his far-right opponent, José Antonio Kast. Kast had strongly opposed rewriting the constitution and many voters were worried for the future of the process should he have won the presidency. But Boric’s victory means he will become Chile’s youngest ever president on 11 March 2022, a decade after he shot to prominence as a scruffy-haired protest leader in 2011. In Santiago, the euphoria of the result has yet to fully die and the tense uncertainty which characterized the runoff campaigns has mostly dissipated. After a bitter campaign, Kast quickly acknowledged his defeat, visiting Boric at his headquarters in the centre of Santiago on Sunday evening and declared that his rival “could count on him” when building a new future for Chile. As president-elect, Boric has been greeted by cheers and chants at each event he has attended. He gave his first speech on a large stage erected on one of Santiago’s main avenues on Sunday night, with jubilant crowds stretching as far as the eye could see in every direction. On Monday, Boric held a two-hour meeting with current president Sebastián Piñera at the presidential palace, La Moneda, flanked by his campaign chief Izkia Siches, 35, and political advisor Giorgio Jackson, 34. Boric’s progressive campaign includes ambitious promises which reflect the momentous generational shift underway in Chile. Boric prioritizes a green, sustainable post-pandemic recovery, and has pledged to raise taxes on the rich to fund public spending and welfare programs. He also wants to make Chile more inclusive than ever before. Boric confirmed on Tuesday that his cabinet will be gender-equal, saying that “women will be protagonists”, and that he hopes to incorporate those from beyond Santiago to recognize the “diversity and heterogeneity of our country”.",News/World news,Chilean president-elect Gabriel Boric urges citizens to back constitution rewrite,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/21/chilean-president-elect-gabriel-boric-constitution-rewrite

Australia could have 200,000 new Covid cases a day by late January without low-to-medium restrictions under a “worst-case scenario”, according to Doherty Institute modelling. That scenario would only be reached “if we do nothing” and is based on people not altering their behaviour, no change to the booster schedule and only basic public health restrictions being in place, according to a senior source. The modelling will be discussed in national cabinet today, along with the spike in Omicron cases and the vaccine booster program. Meanwhile, families could miss out on seeing loved ones in aged care over Christmas as inconsistent restrictions are causing confusion. Advocates are pushing for coherent guidelines and calling for a balance to be struck so residents are protected but not isolated.  Australia wrote to France a week before the submarine contract was cancelled, acknowledging the completion of one requirement for moving to the next stage of the project. The document also included a cautionary line that the next stage of the project remained “subject to government approval”. The correspondence with Naval Group in the lead-up to the decision is a key piece of the Aukus puzzle, although to date the documents released do not show Australia giving a concrete assurance that the project would proceed. The US federal regulators are expected to approve the first pills to treat Covid-19 as early as this week. The news comes as countries around the globe scramble to get on top of the Omicron variant. Many countries are waiting until after Christmas to impose new restrictions. Portugal ordered nightclubs and bars to shut doors and is issuing work-from-home orders from 26 December. Likewise, the UK PM has hinted that new measures could be imposed post-Christmas, and Germany will reimpose tighter rules from 28 December, including a ban on gatherings of more than 10 vaccinated people. The European Commission has emphasised the importance of booster shots and said Covid vaccine certificates would be valid for only nine months without a third jab. The Department of Social Services underpaid almost 70 current and former staff more than $400,000 over nearly five years, FOI documents revealed. The underpayments related to the failure to pay overtime to staff who were required to monitor the media after hours. Parents are running into difficulty booking Covid vaccine appointments for kids aged five to 11, with some being told to “check again in the next few weeks”. The AMA says it is unaware of supply constraints but it has been “given no information about how much is arriving”. The ruler of Dubai has been ordered to pay a divorce settlement which could reach more than half a billion British pounds to protect his ex-wife and their two children from the threat he poses to them. Vladimir Putin has said he will consider a military response if Russia feels threatened by Nato, in a sign that he is not ready to de-escalate tensions over a potential invasion of Ukraine. Donald Trump has provoked controversy after he announced he will hold a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort on 6 January, the first anniversary of the deadly attack on the US Capitol. More than 160 people drowned in two separate shipwrecks off the coast of Libya in the past week as refugees seek safety in Europe. Understanding service workers’ challenges and adjusting your expectations accordingly can ease shopping frustrations, writes Nadine von Cohen in an etiquette guide for holiday shopping. “As we approach our second Christmas at the mercy of a virus that just won’t quit, one would think people would have accepted that supply chain issues and other Covid-related problems might mean low stock and delayed deliveries, as has been the case for going on two years. But after speaking to business owners and frontline retail staff, it seems this is far from true.” During lockdown, Alex McKinnon burned through all the TV he would normally watch and was forced to start picking shows he wouldn’t ordinarily go near, including Boss, a 2011 political drama starting Kelsey Grammer as the hard-as-nails mayor of Chicago. Despite good reviews, Boss was cancelled after two seasons. “But that doesn’t matter, because you don’t watch a show like Boss to see what happens to the characters or where the plot goes,” he writes. “You watch a show like Boss because it is completely bananas. Boss will give you a collection of moments so surreal, it will feel like you dreamed them after drinking too much cough syrup before bed.” From reckonings on race and gender inequality, to Australian sporting heroes shining on the international stage, Guardian Australia’s sports editor, Mike Hytner, and deputy sports editor, Emma Kemp, talk to Laura Murphy-Oates about the biggest moments in sport in 2021 for today’s Full Story.

12/22/2021,"University College London has become the first university to formally cut ties to the LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall, saying its membership of Stonewall’s programmes could inhibit academic freedom and discussion around sex and gender. UCL announced that it would end its involvement with Stonewall’s workplace equality index, which rates employers on their policies, and its diversity schemes, following a recommendation from the university’s most senior academics.  “Following a period of debate within our community and careful consideration of the issues, UCL has now taken the decision that we will not re-join Stonewall’s diversity champions programme or make a submission to the workplace equality index,” UCL said in a statement. The university said its discussions had been “informed by thoughtful and respectful debates” at its equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) committee and its academic board, with the EDI committee voting to retain involvement with Stonewall. But UCL’s management instead sided with the academic board, which voted against retaining links after an anonymous ballot. “In weighing up all opinions in this debate, UCL’s senior leadership team has accepted the academic board’s advice about the fundamental need to uphold academic freedom and freedom of speech in an academic context, recognising that a formal institutional commitment to Stonewall may have the effect of inhibiting academic work and discussion within UCL about sex and gender identity,” the university said. A spokesperson for UCL said the university had “an unwavering commitment” to upholding the rights of LGBTQ+ staff and students. UCL’s senior management plans to establish an LGBTQ+ equality group “to tackle all forms of inequality, marginalisation, and discrimination experienced by LGBTQ+ colleagues and students” and develop an action plan. A Stonewall spokesperson said: “UCL decided not to renew their membership to the diversity champions programme almost two years ago in February 2020. Our work with organisations in no way impacts their ability to uphold free speech, it simply creates welcoming working environments for LGBTQ+ people – which in 2021, should not be a controversial act.” UCL – the largest campus university in the UK – was ranked 98th out of the more than 400 employers who submitted entries to Stonewall’s workplace equality index in 2018. In 2014 it had been the first university to join Stonewall’s global diversity champions programme. But it emerged earlier this year that UCL had withdrawn from the diversity champion’s programme in 2020, which it said it was a temporary decision taken as a result of a cost-cutting review during the Covid pandemic. Under the scheme, members paid fees for Stonewall to assess and advise on their internal equality policies. UCL’s move comes as Stonewall has seen several high-profile organisations, including the BBC and Ofcom, withdraw from its diversity champions programme in recent months. The University of Winchester has also previously withdrawn.",News/Education,UCL becomes first university to formally cut ties with Stonewall,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/dec/21/ucl-becomes-first-university-to-formally-cut-ties-with-stonewall
12/22/2021,"Britain’s equality watchdog has said that racism alleged to have taken place at Yorkshire County Cricket Club was probably unlawful and threatened legal action if appropriate steps are not taken by the club to address discrimination. The club has faced widespread condemnation after its former player Azeem Rafiq alleged it was institutionally racist, detailing years of “inhuman” treatment and abuse he suffered in his two spells there, including players of Pakistani heritage being called the P-word.  On Tuesday, Marcial Boo, the chief executive of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), said: “The accounts of racism and discrimination at Yorkshire County Cricket Club were upsetting and deeply concerning. Sports are meant to bring people of all backgrounds together. Racism has no place in any sport, business or society. “We have now reviewed the documentation and we consider it likely that an unlawful act has taken place.” Boo said the commission had confidence that the new management at the club was taking appropriate steps to deal with past failures. Roger Hutton stepped down as the club’s chairman in early November, and Mark Arthur resigned as chief executive a week later after public outrage over the treatment of their former player and the handling of the investigation into Rafiq’s allegations. Earlier this month, the club’s entire coaching team departed, in a move the new chairman, Kamlesh Patel, said was “in the best interests of the club”. The EHRC also welcomed the agreement of a 12-point action plan between Yorkshire and the England and Wales Cricket Board, which has itself been criticised for inaction after Rafiq first blew the whistle last year and for failing to act on racism within the game more generally. However, the regulator warned that the club could end up in court if it did not adequately put the plan into effect. “We will … be monitoring the club’s action plan closely and we reserve the right to take legal action if the action plan isn’t implemented properly,” said Boo. “We aim to work with the England and Wales Cricket Board and the regulators of other sports to ensure that all those participating, whether for fun, fitness, or as professionals, are not subjected to discrimination and harassment.” In devastating testimony last month to the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, Rafiq told MPs that he had faced repeated racist comments from senior players throughout two spells at Yorkshire between 2008 and 2018 and that the club had done nothing to stop it. He said that racism also seeped into the England dressing room. Rafiq said he had felt suicidal and that his experiences meant he did not want his son “to go anywhere near cricket”. The Pakistan-born player also recounted how, as a 15-year-old at Barnsley Cricket Club, he had wine poured down his throat despite this going against his Muslim faith. On the same day the equality watchdog announced its response to Yorkshire’s action plan, the club announced it had entered into a partnership with a Pakistan Super League team, the Lahore Qalandars, which would include opportunities for players at all levels of each club to gain experience and playing time with the other. Patel said it would “represent an exciting step toward a Yorkshire County Cricket Club that is welcoming and supportive to all”.",Sport/Sport,"Alleged racism at Yorkshire CCC probably unlawful, watchdog finds",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/21/alleged-racism-yorkshire-county-cricket-club-equality-human-rights-commission
12/22/2021,"My wife, Barbara Hanley, who has died aged 76 of cancer, was a potter of distinction and member of the Craft Potters Association. Under the name Barbara Lock she exhibited her ceramics all over the UK. She also taught pottery to young people with special needs and was a campaigner for the rights of descendants of Nazi persecution in Germany. Born in Bushey, Hertfordshire, she was the daughter of Barbara Isralowicz, a Jewish refugee who escaped Germany in 1938, and George Seymour, a teacher of deaf people. Her early years were spent in various parts of the UK before the family settled in north London, where she always felt most at home. She went to Willesden county grammar school.  Married young to Desmond Lock, a campaigner of the political left, and living in Bournemouth, she raised three sons while managing to graduate in ceramics at Bournemouth College of Art (now part of Bournemouth University). She combined being a busy mother with developing her own pottery, and also branching out into teaching pottery to young adults with special needs, at the Strathcona centre in Wembley, after the family moved to London in 1982, and qualifying as an art therapist. She divorced and moved around 1990 to south Wales, where I met her and we became partners, marrying in 2002. Her pottery blossomed, with subtle variations of style and innovation. She had a preference for using raku clay, low-fired and unglazed, and subtle colours inspired by the land and seascapes of Wales and France; latterly her approach was more sculptural, and she created forms reminiscent of birds. A member of the Craft Potters Association, the leading organisation for ceramics, she had her last exhibition at their London gallery in 2018. She was instrumental in founding the Makers’ Guild in Wales and was an active member of South Wales Potters. In recent years she showed at the Kooywood gallery in Cardiff and the Attic gallery in Swansea. In 2017 Barbara wrote a remarkable letter to the Guardian denouncing Germany’s failure to award nationality to all descendants of Nazi persecution, not just those with a Jewish father. Her protest led to the foundation of the Article 116 Exclusions Group, whose work under the leadership of Felix and Isabelle Couchman finally led to a change. Many new German citizens thus owe Barbara a debt. With firm republican, socialist and internationalist convictions, Barbara had razor sharp intelligence and a vast range of cultural interests. She also had empathy for others and an instinctive generosity, all reinforced by a keen sense of humour. She is survived by me, her children, Michael, Alex and Ben, five grandchildren and her brother, Tony.",Arts/Art and design,Barbara Hanley obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/dec/21/barbara-hanley-obituary
12/22/2021,"It is not yet like the end days of Theresa May, where every cabinet decision could be seen through the prism of would-be successors positioning for the coming fight. But it is fair to say that Boris Johnson’s Covid decision-making is taking place in a new context. This was highlighted starkly by coverage of Monday’s long and inconclusive ministerial gathering about the spread of the Omicron variant, which was followed by repeated briefings from various camps about the need to either act now or sit tight and await more data.  After being able to only say that the threat from Omicron was being monitored “hour by hour”, Johnson did act on Tuesday: confirming there would be no new Covid rules for Christmas in England, while keeping open the possibility of a tougher regime afterwards. Johnson’s cabinet has always had its share of hawks and doves over pandemic measures, with plenty of leaks about who was in which camp. But matters have recently changed, on several fronts. The most crucial is that just two years after his massive general election win, the PM has hit turbulent political waters, with plunging approval ratings and weeks of terrible publicity leaving him the butt of prime-time TV jokes, and the target of chants at sporting events. This, coupled with a series of damaging U-turns and a perception of drift, has emboldened many Tory MPs to either switch off or rebel, most notably the 99-vote mutiny over new Covid measures last week. It was thus notable that in the flurry of briefings after Monday’s cabinet meeting, many of the ministers most frequently linked to opposing new curbs, something unlikely to be popular with Tory MPs or members, were those expected to court these constituencies should Johnson’s time in No 10 end. Among these were Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, Liz Truss, the foreign secretary and favourite of the party faithful, and Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary whose stint leading the Covid vaccine rollout has greatly boosted his status. It is not a hard-and-fast rule. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, who is potentially considering another leadership try, was identified as in the more pro-restrictions camp. But even here, allies of Javid were keen to stress this is based purely on the data about Omicron, countering any notion he has been captured by the public health “blob”, not an impression likely to go down well with grassroots Tories. All this is notably complicated by the fact that imposing new Covid restrictions on a largely vaccinated public involves more nuanced decisions than was the case a year ago, even with a fast-spreading new variant, and thus the lines between hawks and doves can blur. Similarly, even the most rule-sceptic minister would admit that with so relatively little known about Omicron, not least the severity of the disease it tends to cause, that a few days of dramatic data could easily swing the argument again. Downing Street has been keen to knock back suggestions of a cabinet split, noting that Monday’s meeting was only ever planned as an information-sharing event for ministers. But one thing is clear. Even if Johnson had wanted to limit people’s Christmas plans, whether by advice or formal regulation, it is by no means clear this was politically viable. In the visceral words of one Tory MP, speaking before Tuesday’s decision to put back any change until after Christmas, had Johnson imposed restrictions now he would be a “dead man walking”. The prime minister knows this. So do his MPs. But perhaps most crucially, so do his rivals.",News/Politics,PM’s Covid decision-making conditioned by new political reality,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/21/pms-covid-decision-making-conditioned-by-new-political-reality
12/22/2021,"My mother, Lili Armstrong, who has died aged 106, was a survivor of Nazi Germany and her life was affected by many of the significant events of the 20th century. Born in Berlin during the first world war, she was the daughter of Jewish parents, Jenny (nee Gutman) and Samuel Weiss. Her father ran a mineral water company but contracted stomach cancer and took his own life when Lili was two.  Later on she was an aspiring concert pianist and also represented Berlin as a teenage sprinter just as Adolf Hitler was coming to power. In 1937 Lili managed to charm officials into allowing her to attend an agricultural course in Yugoslavia, which was then an established gateway for entry into Palestine. Her mother died of a heart condition shortly before the start of the second world war, while her half-sister Klaera and nephew Kurt were both murdered in Nazi concentration camps. In Palestine, Lili met my father, Walter Levy (who later changed his name to Peter Munk). They married and my brother, Ariel, was born in 1944. Lili was there during the first Arab-Israeli war, leaving the newly founded state of Israel in 1948 to join Walter in London only after nearly two years of separation. Later my father started the Commonwealth Players, one of the first multicultural acting groups, with Lili designing and painting the scenery. The marriage never recovered from their time apart. I was born in 1952, possibly a last-ditch attempt to save it. In the late 1950s my mother started working for Neville Armstrong, of the publishers Neville Spearman. Their relationship began soon after that. In 1976 they set up home in Suffolk but did not marry until 1999, after Neville’s first wife had died, when they were well into their 80s; my parents had divorced in 1967. Lili was vivacious, optimistic and sharp-eyed. She was also an avid theatre-goer, a lover of yoga and shoe polishing. In 1997 her life story was documented in the interview she gave for the USC Shoah Foundation in California, Steven Spielberg’s video archive of Holocaust witnesses. In later years, Lili left Suffolk after Neville died in 2008. At 94 she moved to London to start a new life; a broken hip did nothing to dent her enthusiasm or energy. She was an accomplished artist, attending classes once a week, and going to lectures at the University of the Third Age until dementia stopped her. A woman whose life stretched of more than a century, she was a force of nature. Lili is survived by Ariel and me, eight grandchildren, Sophie, Josh, Charlotte, Matthew, Isobella, Phoebe, Flora and Reuben, and two great-grandchildren, Lila and Oliver.

12/22/2021,"Scott Perry, a Pennsylvania Republican and the first sitting member of Congress to be requested to provide documents and sit for an interview with the committee investigating the Capitol riot, said on Tuesday he would not comply with the panel.  The news came shortly after Donald Trump provocatively announced that he will hold a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort on 6 January, the first anniversary of the deadly attack on Congress. Perry’s refusal to appear sets up a potentially fraught battle if the panel decides to subpoena him and he – like other Trump allies – decides to ignore that too. The committee has already recommended other no-shows, such as Trump aide Steve Bannon, be prosecuted for their non-compliance. Perry claimed the 6 January committee was “illegitimate, and not duly constituted under the rules of the US House of Representatives”. Successive court rulings have said that the committee was properly formed and does have the investigative powers it is using. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, rejected an attempt by the minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, to put Republicans including Jim Jordan of Ohio – a close Trump ally and a subject of investigation regarding the Capitol attack – on to the 6 January committee. Only two Republicans, Trump critics Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, are now part of its work. Trump announced his press conference in a statement replete with familiar invective and lies about supposed electoral fraud and the House committee. “I will be having a news conference on 6 January [2022] at Mar-a-Lago to discuss all of these points, and more,” he said. “Until then, remember, the insurrection took place on 3 November, it was the completely unarmed protest of the rigged election that took place on 6 January.” Five people, including a Trump supporter shot by law enforcement and a Capitol police officer, died around the events of 6 January 2021, when a pro-Trump mob stormed Congress after he told supporters to “fight like hell” to overturn his defeat by Joe Biden. More than 700 people have been charged with offenses connected to the riot. Most rioters were not armed with guns but attacked police with other weapons. Guns and explosives were found and bombs planted. On Monday, one rioter who attacked police was sentenced to more than five years in jail. Trump was impeached for inciting an insurrection but acquitted at his Senate trial when enough Republicans stayed loyal. His continued presence in national politics and apparent intention to run for president again has stoked jagged divides which some observers fear point the US towards serious discord or even civil war. On Monday night the disgraced former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly, with whom the former president has staged an arena tour, said Trump was “gonna run again”. “I’m trying to tell President Trump, run on your record,” O’Reilly told NewsNation. “He’s gonna run again. I said, Run on your record, because your record’s pretty darn good.’” Trump seems determined to run, or merely to retain control of the Republican party, through stoking division and anger with false claims about the election and the most serious attack on the US Capitol since the war of 1812. In stark contrast, Pelosi has announced that Congress will mark the first anniversary of 6 January in a spirit of “solemn observance”. “Preparations are under way for a full program of events,” she said, “including a discussion among historians about the narrative of that day; an opportunity for members to share their experiences and reflections from that day; and a prayerful vigil in the evening.” The 6 January committee also expects to stage events in the new year, with public hearings as it closes in on Trump’s role in the riot. On Sunday, Kinzinger said the panel would determine if Trump committed a crime. “Nobody is above the law,” he said. “He’s not a king. Former presidents, they aren’t former kings.” Trump has sued, so far unsuccessfully, to stop the committee accessing White House documents from his time in power. Two of his closest aides are in serious legal jeopardy for taking similar stands. Bannon has pleaded not guilty to contempt of Congress for refusing to cooperate with the 6 January committee. He faces a fine and jail time if convicted. The House has recommended the same criminal charge for Mark Meadows, Trump’s last chief of staff and a former congressman. On Monday, citing sources close to Trump, the Guardian revealed his deepening fear as the 6 January committee continues its work. “The former president’s anger largely mirrors the kind of expletives he once directed at the Russia inquiry and the special counsel investigation [led by Robert Mueller] when he occupied the White House,” the Guardian reported. “But the rapidly accelerating investigation into whether Trump and top aides unlawfully conspired to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s victory at the 6 January joint session appears to be unnerving him deeply.” On Twitter, Peter Strzok, a former FBI agent and member of the special counsel’s team, wrote: “Almost as if – what did he say about Mueller? – ‘I’m fucked.’”",News/US news,Republican congressman refuses to cooperate with Capitol attack panel,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/21/donald-trump-press-conference-capitol-attack-mar-a-lago
12/22/2021,"At first glance, the picture published by the Guardian of Downing Street staff spending time together in the garden of No 10 last May seemed to answer one big question: yes, they did gather for cheese and wine. But since it was published, a series of increasingly complex explanations of the event have emerged: how it constituted a staff meeting but also amounted to “exhausted people … having a drink after the formal business had been done”, or otherwise “individuals having a drink outside working hours, but still discussing work”.  The image has prompted a wave of analysis, intrigue, anger and of course memes. Days on, a close analysis of the picture itself, however, throws up a number of further mysteries that are yet to be resolved … Carrie Symonds (now Johnson) was said to be enjoying time in her private garden and seems to have taken the most sensible approach: ignore the staff and talk to your husband. Baby Wilfred does not seem that fussed. He may be engaged in his own work projects. The photo was taken in the early evening of 15 May 2020, the temperature a balmy 18C. If you must drink red wine in such weather while you work, as this group appears to be, go for “something light and chillable – like a Fleurie from Beaujolais in France,” suggests the master sommelier Ronan ​​Sayburn, founder of the Ronan Sayburn wine academy. That would go well with camembert or brie, he adds. Sadly, not even the Guardian’s crack imaging team can provide a high enough resolution picture to identify exactly what is on the cheeseboard, but the large, hard oblong that is visible looks suspiciously like … cheddar. Since this is a work event, the attender identified as the senior civil servant Martin Reynolds is perhaps pondering next steps while emphasising that the total number of coronavirus cases as of that evening – 236,711 – is this high. Since it is a work event, we can rule out that Reynolds is gesturing vaguely towards the setting sun to indicate what a lovely evening it is to unwind with a nice glass of red wine and some hard cheddar. This figure, almost horizontal despite the support of a sturdy rattan chair, is obviously turning Reynolds’ point over in his steel-trap mind, readying himself to cut through all the nonsense with a revolutionary counterproposal, and certainly not zoning out while his counterpart bangs on about what a lovely spring it is. He also needs some new trousers, further supporting the case that this is Cummings. “I’m gonna double check with my elders and betters, but that’s probably going to be a no comment from us,” says a nice man who answers the phone at Daunt HQ, remaining admirably composed under the same sort of media pressure faced by the Peloton PR team over that Sex and the City controversy. He calls back to add: “Yeah, it’s broadly no comment, except to say we won’t be putting it on our website.” This image suggests an estimate of: one smartphone on a table, face down; one notebook on a table, closed; one phone actively in use, in a huddle on the other side of the garden; 19, or 20 if you include Wilfred, or 21 if you include Dilyn the dog, of the best minds in Westminster operating at peak capacity with no pens to take notes or whiteboards to scrawl terrifying bullet points on. This is pandemic management at its very rawest and most thrilling: Downing Street unplugged. If so, this group are the best evidence for the essential nature of this gathering. Based on the admittedly limited clues available, we can surmise that the three on the left are smiling and nodding awkwardly as one of the two in the middle tells an interminable story about his commute; the man standing slightly apart in the middle has abandoned all pretence of good manners to check the Guardian liveblog on his phone; and the two men in blue shirts on the right are being forced to break off an enjoyable session muttering about how much they dislike their colleagues by the presence of the awkward figure in the dark suit, clearly a superior, maybe even a minister, trying once again to be part of the gang. Nobody could begrudge this lot the several bottles on their table, or feel anything but relief on their part that at least one of them appears to be in a cooler. Easily the most mysterious corner of the image. Are they plotting, or flirting? If plotting, does that constitute a work conversation? If those adorable flashes of white – rear to the right, snout to the left – are indeed Dilyn the dog alongside James Slack, the PM’s then official spokesperson, how long until he (Dilyn) notices the cheese on the patio and makes a run for it?

12/22/2021,"Most of the people who lost their lives when their flimsy dinghy sank in the Channel last month have been named for the first time in a new investigation. The BBC World Service has named 20 of the people who travelled to the UK in search of a better life but drowned in the early hours of 24 November.  The investigation has pieced together the final hours of the overladen dinghy’s journey. Official reports say there were at least 31 passengers on board, including a seven-year-old girl, but relatives of those who drowned believe there were 33 on the boat. Not all of the bodies have yet been found. French media has reported that three bodies recently washed up on the beach in Calais, but they have not yet been identified. Among those on board were members of the same family and people who had formed friendships. All hoped the UK would provide them with sanctuary and safety. Many of those who died were from Iraqi Kurdistan, but there were others from Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Somalia and Egypt. Of the 27 bodies recovered, seven were women, two were teenagers and one was a child. Many had tried to reach the UK multiple times before, either by dinghy or using other means. The final phone messages pieced together by the BBC reveal a chilling change of tone, from optimistic messages when people first boarded the boat to a growing sense of fear and panic when its engine failed. The right side of the boat later deflated and started to take in water. A message from one of those who died, “Hybar” Bryar Hamad Abdulrahman, 23, said: “We are starting our journey tonight. Pray for us.” The stretch of sea they crossed, between Calais and Dover, is 21 miles wide. The Channel is the busiest shipping lane in the world. According to the BBC report, the dinghy is thought to have cost about £400 and had space for no more than 20 passengers. The journey is thought to have started at about 10pm and things seemed to go well until about 1.30am when water started coming into the dinghy as one side deflated. Things deteriorated drastically when the boat’s engine failed at about 2.30am. The boat is thought to have sunk within 30 minutes. The passengers were left clinging to the remains of the dinghy in icy waters. At 3.42am, two passengers succeeded in getting through to British authorities who are thought to have asked for their location and told them to keep their phone torches on to help rescuers find them. But the phones are reported to have slipped into the water before they could do this. One of the survivors, Mohammed Isa Omar, told the BBC: “I saw people dying in front of me.” He said that was is a strong swimmer and managed to swim to a ship, which rescued him. By the time daylight came, there were two sightings of dead bodies: the first by people in another dinghy who phoned emergency services; the second by French fisher Karl Maquinghen and his crew on the trawler Saint Jacques II, who saw 15 bodies in the water. The maritime border between the UK and France in the Channel is not a clear one. Relatives of those who lost their lives have started a legal case asking for a public inquiry so that the full facts of what happened that night – the position of the dinghy at various times and the calls to and responses from the various emergency services – can be known.

12/22/2021,"At a long and difficult cabinet meeting on Monday, hawkish ministers demanded “incontrovertible evidence” that Omicron risks overwhelming the NHS to justify the cost of taking action, while on Tuesday Boris Johnson confirmed his view that there is insufficient evidence to justify new measures – yet. While some clarity on the hospitalisation rate associated with the new variant should be available within a day or two, scientists have warned that getting the evidence ministers want may be “a tall order”. So why is it so hard to work out, and what does that mean for decision-making?  Omicron cases are doubling quicker than every 48 hours – which means the number of individuals who will develop severe disease is also rising exponentially. However, it takes roughly 10 days from testing positive for Covid for this increase to be observed in the hospital data. Ten days ago, the total number of confirmed Omicron cases in the UK was 1,898. As of 19 December, the cumulative total was 45,145 – although the true number will be many times higher because a lot of infected people are not getting tested and there is a delay in confirming suspected Omicron cases. Hospitals in London are reporting an uptick in Covid admissions but 10 days from now the number is likely to have mushroomed, regardless of Omicron’s severity, because of the sheer number of infections. Many scientists remain sceptical of claims Omicron triggers less severe disease. More certain is that many of those who have been vaccinated will experience less severe disease, meaning fewer of these individuals will be admitted to hospital. Yet pinpointing precisely how much impact vaccinations – and especially boosters – will have is fraught with difficulty. Modelling studies help, but these tend to predict a range of scenarios. “You go from something that’s not as bad as last winter, to much worse. From a policymaking point of view, that’s not that helpful, because they don’t assign any probability to any of those scenarios,” said Dr Raghib Ali, a senior clinical research associate at the University of Cambridge MRC Epidemiology Unit. “I think incontrovertible evidence is a tall ask,” said Prof Sheila Bird, formerly of the Medical Research Council’s biostatistics unit at the University of Cambridge. “What I imagine [minsters] are trying to do is work out [what] is the effect of the booster immunisations on hospitalisation rates for Omicron versus Delta. But that depends upon how many people were boosted about four weeks ago, then had two weeks to develop full protection from that booster, in that time got Omicron versus got Delta, and then were hospitalised.” Part of the problem is that things are constantly changing: the rate at which people have been receiving boosters has changed, while fear about Omicron’s spread has prompted some people to behave more cautiously or to seek PCR tests in greater numbers. Others have said that risk to the NHS and other sectors of society isn’t so much about disease severity as the extraordinarily high number of infections. “It is transmission that drives impact more than severity,” Jeremy Farrer, the director of the Wellcome Trust and a former member of Sage, told the Today programme. He said the country was in “the most difficult, most uncertain” period of the pandemic so far. Even with high uptake of booster vaccines, there will be some who remain more vulnerable to severe disease, and not everyone has been boosted or had time for those boosters to take effect. Then there are roughly 6 million adults who haven’t been vaccinated at all. “That’s a lot of people, when the level of transmission is what it is today,” Farrer said. Uncertainties remain, but Ali believes a clearer picture should emerge imminently. “The key metric, which takes into account both the intrinsic severity of Omicron and the degree of human escape, is the case hospitalisation rate – so, for a given number of cases, what proportion ended up in hospital?” he said. “With Delta, that’s currently about 2%. With Omicron, we don’t know yet, but I’d have thought that should be coming by this week, because there have been enough cases now.” Yet even this estimate will be only a rough guess, due to the small number of cases and their demographics. Dr David Pascall, a postdoctoral research associate, also at the MRC Biostatistics Unit, said: “Estimates can be made in real time, but the early estimates will be imprecise and biased. Stable precise estimates will be only possible to generate early next year. Probably in the latter half of January. “At the moment, Omicron cases have been rising most in younger age groups who are likely to have less negative outcomes on infection. We have reasons to expect that this won’t last, not least because of the increased intergenerational mixing expected over the Christmas period. This will have unpredictable impacts, given the questions still remaining over the effectiveness of vaccine protection against Omicron. “As such, we can have expectations about how severe infections in this wave will be, but incontrovertible evidence on both absolute severity and severity relative to Delta (over the same time period) can only be generated retrospectively after hospitalisations occur.” However, concern isn’t limited to the NHS being overwhelmed. High rates of absence in key sectors such as education, law enforcement, or food processing and delivery could have unforeseen impacts on our lives in the coming weeks. Dr Simon Clarke, an associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said: “People understandably focus on hospitalisations and deaths, but we should not overlook the effects of a mass sickness on public services, infrastructure and economic activity.” And then there’s long Covid: infections need to be minimised to prevent the risk of long-term disability and suffering, experts warn. Waiting for incontrovertible evidence is a high-stakes gamble. The government placed a similar bet in March 2020 when it delayed introducing measures as other countries locked down.

12/22/2021,"Antonio Conte has laid bare the depth of his anger towards Uefa over the decision to throw Tottenham out of the Europa Conference League, describing it as incredible, unfair, disrespectful and influenced by “personal interest”. The Tottenham manager, who said his players were “very, very disappointed”, also made clear his determination to fight it at a higher level – in other words, the court of arbitration for sport. The club have confirmed they will think about going there with an appeal although, at present, it is nothing more than a consideration.  Spurs were unable to play their final tie of the group phase at home against Rennes on 9 December after they were affected by a Covid outbreak with eight first-team players and five coaches testing positive. On the advice of the Health Security Agency the club temporarily closed the first-team area of their training ground. Uefa rules say games can be postponed if a club have fewer than 13 available senior players and no goalkeeper. When Tottenham’s attempts to find a new date for the tie before Uefa’s cut-off of 31 December failed, the governing body awarded Rennes a 3-0 walkover, meaning Vitesse advanced from second place to a two-leg play-off for the last 16. Had Spurs beaten Rennes, they would have finished second. “There are no positives [about easing a crowded calendar] and, for sure, this is an incredible decision,” Conte said, before Spurs’ Carabao Cup quarter-final at home against West Ham on Wednesday night. “This decision is not fair. It wasn’t our fault. It was because we had many, many players with Covid and the government decided to stop our training sessions, to stop our training centre. We deserved to play the qualification on the pitch. I’m very disappointed with Uefa because everybody knows the problem. It means that maybe someone does not know very well the problem that we are having. And I think only some personal interest.” Conte was asked to explain what he meant by “personal interest”, although he did not really do so. “For me, it’s very, very difficult, it’s very difficult to understand this decision,” he replied. “Tottenham started to play in this competition from this summer and now it’s unfair – for a decision that is not in our hands – to tell Tottenham: ‘Thanks very much. You went here, here and here but now you lose 3-0.’ “Why? We honoured the competition to play and to go around Europe. But now Uefa is taking a decision that I don’t like. It is lacking respect about our job.” Spurs said in a statement on Monday that, despite the disappointment, they had “to accept this ruling … Our focus now turns to the competitions we remain in”. Plainly, though, Conte is not ready to give up. The winners of the Conference League will secure a spot in next season’s Europa League. “I hope that in the future, in the next step, with the court, something can change,” he said. “Now it’s not definitive. Uefa have taken this decision but then there is another step to confirm or not this incredible decision. “Is the next step court? Yes. We are confident that in another step, they take a normal decision. Not a decision in our favour, a normal decision. It was incredible what Uefa did but also in the explanation. I have read [they said] that Tottenham couldn’t play the game for Covid cases and, despite this, they took this decision. But we are very, very confident for the next step. I can’t accept this [from Uefa].” Conte, who reported all of his players were now Covid negative, has re‑energised the squad since taking over from Nuno Espirito Santo – nobody more so than Eric Dier, who has starred in the middle of the back three. “Eric can become one of the best players in the world in his position,” the Italian said. “This role is perfect for him.”",Sport/Football,Antonio Conte furious over Uefa’s ‘incredible’ European sanction for Spurs,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/21/antonio-conte-hits-back-at-uefa-over-tottenhams-europa-conference-league-sanction
12/22/2021,"The NHS has increased the daily rate of booster vaccinations by three-quarters in a week – but remains short of the roughly 1.5m jabs a day needed to match Boris Johnson’s promise of a booster jab for all those eligible by the end of the year. One group of health service bosses said the NHS “should not be blamed” if the target is not met, reflecting concern there could be political recriminations if the goal set by the prime minister just over a week ago is not reached.  On Monday, 897,979 boosters were administered around the UK, compared with 513,722 a week ago, the day after the prime minister brought forward the vaccination target in a televised address. There remain 15.1 million people across the UK who had a second jab before the end of September and have not yet had a booster – and there are 10 days, excluding Christmas Day, to complete the programme in line with the prime minister’s pledge. Johnson had promised that everybody eligible aged 18 or over “will have the chance to get their booster before the new year” – a commitment that applied to England but has been matched by Northern Ireland. Wales has pledged to offer the jab to all able to receive one by the end of the year. NHS bosses were not given any notice of Johnson’s commitment. Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS Trusts, said it had always known the pledge was ambitious – and emphasised the speed at which the number of vaccinations had been increased. “We must avoid a situation where blame is placed on the NHS, when staff are working completely flat out to get jabs in arms at a time when they are also working through a significant backlog of routine care,” she added. Scotland, however, has already walked away from matching Johnson’s promise. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, wants 80% of the eligible population vaccinated with boosters before the new year and, on Tuesday, said she was confident that target would be met. The figures for England show that 753,793 people received a booster on Monday, leaving 12.5 million people who have had a second jab still awaiting the extra vaccination. That amounts to more than 1.2m jabs a day over the remaining 10 days. Adding Northern Ireland and Wales leaves 13.8 million eligible people to go, a required rate of 1.4m a day. Labour’s health spokesperson, Wes Streeting, said the party had called on ministers to increase the booster programme to half a million a day in October. “The government’s delay has left the NHS with a difficult target to hit, but if anyone can do it, they can.” But the Conservatives said the party would not take lessons from Labour. “They wanted to keep us in the European Medicines Agency – if we had listened to them our world-leading rollout would have been massively delayed,” a party source said.",News/World news,NHS increases daily rate of booster jabs by 75% in one week,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/21/nhs-increases-daily-rate-of-booster-jabs-by-75-in-one-week
12/22/2021,"Premiership rugby clubs would struggle to survive another lockdown, the Bristol director of rugby Pat Lam has warned, after tighter restrictions on sporting events in Wales and Scotland put officials on red alert. Matches in Wales will go behind closed doors from Boxing Day while crowds in Scotland will be capped at just 500 people for three weeks from 26 December.  Lam has voiced his concerns should restrictions in England tighten while Six Nations organisers will also be paying close attention given Scotland are due to host England on the first day of next year’s competition on 5 February and considering there is no current end date to the new measures in Wales. Some Premiership clubs were driven to the brink of bankruptcy when the league was put on hold between March and August last year before last season was played out in largely empty stadiums. Compounding matters, central funding from the Rugby Football Union took a swingeing cut with some clubs losing around £1m a month before full crowds returned this season. On Tuesday the prime minister, Boris Johnson, did not rule out further restrictions being introduced after Christmas to combat the spread of the Omicron variant, which could in turn affect sporting events. Harlequins, who are hopeful of a crowd in excess of 70,000 for the Big Game at Twickenham next Monday, are now facing an anxious wait in the coming days. In the longer term, when asked if the Premiership could survive in the event of another lockdown, Lam, who revealed last week that Bristol’s cancelled match against the Scarlets cost the club £300,000, said: “I don’t think so. People look at us and think, ‘They have got [owner] Steve Lansdown, a billionaire,’ but what people tend to forget is we don’t have what Steve is worth. Steve has put in his time here close to £80m of his own money into Bristol rugby, and that is a lot of money. “We have a fantastic product. Professional rugby is a great game, but the reality is there are a lot of wealthy people who are losing money. I don’t mean to be all doom and gloom, but this is not as cosy as people think. I am pretty sure PRL [Premiership Rugby Limited] will be talking to the government. The decision by the Premier League to keep going was an important one for rugby as well.”",Sport/Sport,"Lockdown a major threat to Premiership rugby clubs, says Bristol’s Pat Lam",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/21/lockdown-a-major-threat-to-premiership-rugby-clubs-says-bristols-pat-lam
12/22/2021,"In August 1965, the German-born, Oxford-educated economist EF Schumacher published an article in the Observer. Titled “Help them to help themselves”, it criticised the prevailing model of aid to the developing world and proposed a new emphasis on regional planning and “intermediate technology”. If the west would give up trying to impose the latest production methods, he argued, it could instead unleash the “power of self-help”. That article led to the creation of a charity today known as Practical Action. The approach it pioneered, of supporting local people to make incremental changes to improve their lives, lies at the heart of the Guardian and Observer’s 2021 charity appeal. All over the world, as our recent “Living on the frontline of global heating” series showed, climate breakdown is having disastrous consequences for the people and communities who (along with their ancestors) have contributed least to the problem of global heating. Practical Action and the other three charities that we are supporting cannot stop carbon emissions. But they can, and will, help people in some of the hardest-hit areas and communities to adapt, survive and thrive.  Practical Action does this by supporting farmers – for example, by supplying climate-resilient seeds and helping them to develop new practices. It also funds schemes that provide flood warnings, repair damage and develop clean energy. The Global Greengrants Fund UK, with whom we have partnered before, has overlapping aims, but a different focus: it identifies grassroots climate projects, including those led by indigenous people and focused on their rights, and awards micro-grants. In 2019, it channelled £250,000 donated by Guardian and Observer readers to rainforest protection groups in the ecologically critical Amazon basin. The Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) campaigns for climate refugees, who lack status and protection in international law. In rich western countries, particularly those with temperate climates, we have so far been relatively protected from the most dangerous effects of the climate crisis. But all over the world, people are brutally exposed by environmental degradation, including deforestation, overfishing and water shortages. In the two decades since it was formed, the EJF has worked in some of the world’s least-accessible countries, using film and other tools to shine a light on human rights abuses linked to environmental insecurity. Finally, Kew is famous for its stunning gardens and botanical collections – one in London, another at Wakehurst in Sussex. But the Royal Botanic Gardens also has an important presence in Madagascar, one of the world’s diversity hotspots, where Kew scientists have worked for 40 years. The island is experiencing terrible droughts and cannot afford to build the pipeline that it needs to protect both nature and livelihoods, as was highlighted by its environment minister in Glasgow. The Kew charity will use its share of this year’s fundraising total to develop agricultural systems and restore denuded land (sometimes called rewilding) in such a way as to support people and protect their country’s extraordinary nature. The shortfall in the climate finance package promised by rich countries to poor ones is among the many grave failures of climate diplomacy. Our appeal cannot, of course, fill that huge gap. But thanks to the generosity of our readers, and despite the cancellation of last weekend’s telethon, we can make a meaningful difference to the lives of some of the people on the frontline of the climate crisis.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view: help us to help those on the climate frontline | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/21/the-guardian-view-help-us-to-help-those-on-the-climate-frontline
12/22/2021,"The relief is immense. But so is the challenge that lies ahead. Gabriel Boric’s sweeping victory over his far-right opponent José Antonio Kast in Chile’s presidential election on Sunday was welcome to all those alarmed at the prospect of a leader who admires the country’s late dictator Augusto Pinochet and embraces Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro. Polls had predicted that Mr Boric would win modestly in the second round; instead, with a 12 percentage point lead on a high turnout – giving him more votes than any president in history – he has a resounding mandate. Now Chile’s youngest ever president-elect, just 35, must attempt to push through his ambitious pledges of sweeping reform – including abolishing the private pension system, raising taxes, increasing the minimum wage and forgiving student debt – in a polarised nation. Undoubtedly, many were driven to support him by the prospect of a Kast presidency, with potential echoes of both Pinochet and Trump. Mr Kast, the son of a Nazi, railed against migrants and the “gay lobby” and said he would ban abortion (already extremely tightly restricted). But the deeper roots of Mr Boric’s success lie in the explosion of protest in 2019 over the cost of living, inadequate welfare and public services in one of the world’s most unequal countries; 1% of the population owns 25% of its wealth, according to the UN. While foreign investors have long hailed Chile as a success story, more than half of households are classed as economically vulnerable. Many have had enough of free-market dogma. Though detractors warn that Mr Boric is inexperienced, others are hungry for a new start.  Mr Boric is the most leftwing leader since Salvador Allende was overthrown by the 1973 coup, and was drawn into politics as a student protester, but he is hardly a firebrand. He positions himself in the European social democratic tradition. He is of a new generation: a feminist and environmentalist who wants better mental health services and who says he has obsessive compulsive disorder. He proclaimed that “if Chile was the cradle of neoliberalism, it will also be its grave”, but also moderated his message over the campaign and reached out to the centrist left. Following his victory, he has pledged to unite the country. His victory has buoyed those who see a swing to the left in Latin America – including Brazil’s former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, hoping for his own comeback next year. But while some hope the devastation that the pandemic has wrought in the US and Brazil has shown the perils of rightwing populists such as Donald Trump and Mr Bolsonaro, there is still plenty of power on the right. Mr Kast was unexpectedly swift and gracious in conceding the election. But the peso fell to a historic low against the dollar on news of Mr Boric’s win, and stocks plunged 10%, reflecting the business class’s fear that a system which has cherished their interests over those of ordinary Chileans is about to change. The right are also anxious about the rewriting of the Pinochet-era constitution. Mr Boric must now attempt to enact his agenda in a split legislature and to satisfy both his base and those he has more recently won over, while keeping the rightwing elite at bay. He has proved himself an adept negotiator and a pragmatic judge of political possibilities. He will never have needed those skills more.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Chile’s new president: Boric brings a fresh start | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/21/the-guardian-view-on-chiles-new-president-boric-brings-a-fresh-start
12/22/2021,"The convictions of four asylum seekers for driving small boats across the Channel have been found unsafe by the court of appeal in a ruling that identified systemic failings in such prosecutions. The three judges in the case said the convictions “must be quashed in due course”. Three of the men who appealed had their convictions quashed on Tuesday; a fourth man’s appeal is pending as the Crown Prosecution Service is seeking a retrial of his case.  All four men were convicted after being filmed driving dinghies bringing asylum seekers across the Channel. But the judges said that in order to secure convictions in cases of this kind, the prosecution must prove that the person accused of driving the boat “knew or had reasonable cause to believe that his act was assisting entry or attempted entry into the United Kingdom without leave”. The men were all appealing against convictions they received at Canterbury crown court for assisting unlawful immigration by piloting small boats across the Channel. Lord Justice Edis, Mrs Justice May and Mr Justice Blake heard the case. They said in their ruling: “We invited the Crown Prosecution Service to help us on how it came about that the law was misunderstood when investigating, charging and prosecuting these cases.” New CPS guidance about this kind of case was welcomed in the judgment. The judgment states that criminal investigations and subsequent prosecutions were launched without careful analysis of the law and appropriate guidance to those conducting interviews, taking charging decisions and presenting cases to courts. “It appears also that the judges in the small number of courts where these cases are tried and defence practitioners followed the flawed view of the law which developed without conducting analysis of their own resulting in an erroneous shared approach. Although this is obviously less than ideal, allocating blame is less important than sorting out the consequences,” the ruling states. All four who were convicted helped steer the boats they were travelling in, were intercepted by Border Force vessels, escorted to shore and then taken to the Kent Intake Unit for the initial processing of their asylum claims. The four men whose convictions were found to be unsafe are: Samyar Ahmadii Bani, 38, from Iran, who was convicted in November 2019 and sentenced to six years in prison; Mohamoud al Anzi, 55, from Kuwait, who was convicted in February 2021 and sentenced to three years and nine months; Fariboz Taher Rakei, 60, from Iran, who was convicted in March 2021 and sentenced to four years and six months; and Ghodratallah Donyamali Zadeh, 37, from Iran, the only person to plead guilty, who was sentenced to two years in October 2020. The CPS is seeking a retrial in Rakei’s case. Seven other cases raising similar issues are due to be heard by the court in January. Tuesday’s ruling is the latest in a series of blows to the government, with the new nationality and borders bill ramping up penalties for those accused of steering dinghies across the Channel. The home secretary has suffered a series of defeats in the high court this year. They include: having to make payments to trafficking victims who had financial support removed at the start of the pandemic; being required to provide a grant of leave to remain for trafficking victims; and having to give protections for people in immigration detention who have HIV. Ben Stuttard, a solicitor at Commons who represented Zadeh, welcomed the ruling. “Pending cases before the crown court will no doubt be reviewed by prosecuting authorities and some cases may be discontinued. Mr Zadeh and others have served prison sentences in appalling conditions for a crime they did not commit and were denied the opportunity to fairly defend.” Karen Doyle, a founding member of Movement for Justice, also welcomed the judgment. “This judgment makes clear that seeking asylum is not a crime. However, several asylum seekers still face trial in 2022 and several are still in prison.” A CPS spokesperson said: “We won’t hesitate to prosecute those suspected of immigration offences if our legal test for a prosecution is met and [the offences are] against the law as it currently stands. “Since prosecuting these cases, new judgments have clarified a very complicated section of law. In the summer we published revised guidance – taking into account recent judgments – about prosecuting those who exploit and profit from the desperation of others or put lives at risk through controlling or piloting overcrowded small boats across the busiest shipping channel in the world or confining them in lorries.”",News/UK news,Convictions quashed for men who drove dinghies across Channel,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/21/convictions-quashed-for-men-who-drove-dinghies-across-channel

Are we still holding to the bullshit line that people were actually doing some work at these gatherings? Johnson: I like the use of the word gathering. Be sure to use it. And yes absolutely.

12/22/2021,"A former police officer who spent more than 17 years in prison after being convicted of killing his pregnant partner has been freed after being found not guilty at a retrial. Gary Walker, now 57, was sentenced to life imprisonment in October 2004 for murdering Audra Bancroft at their home near Burton upon Trent. After a retrial at Warwick crown court, Mr Justice Holgate QC agreed with a submission by Walker’s barrister, David Emanuel QC, that there was no case to answer.  The retrial heard evidence that Bancroft, 36, died as a result of a paramedic moving her from the recovery position on to her back and propping her head up, where she stayed for five hours, leading to positional asphyxia. The ruling was challenged by the prosecutor, Rachel Brand QC, but after a hearing at the court of appeal on Friday, it was upheld. Walker was found guilty and sentenced to a minimum of 12 years in prison after the prosecution alleged he had strangled Bancroft on 8 December 2003 shortly after finding out she had accrued £4,000 in debt on a credit card. He has continually maintained his innocence. During the retrial it was alleged Walker had met Bancroft on a street as he was returning from a night shift at Avonmouth police station, where he assaulted her before “frog-marching” the mother-of-three back to their home in Shipley Close, Branston. “Witnesses who lived in Shipley Close heard voices in the street, and on looking out of their windows they saw the defendant propelling Audra Bancroft along, holding on to her with his hand under her armpit, almost dragging her along,” Brand told jurors. “We say that he continued to assault her when he got her home.” Brand told the court that immediately after the incident, Walker suggested Bancroft’s ex-husband “might have been responsible” for her injuries and told people he had found her already injured in the street. The prosecution also alleged Walker “staged calls” and left voice messages on Bancroft’s phone to make it appear as if the couple were not together. One of two paramedics Walker called to the address said Bancroft had bruising to her face, a lump on her forehead and an injury to her lip. Her condition deteriorated and she went into cardiac arrest at about 8am and died an hour later in hospital. Walker claimed the injuries had been caused as he defended himself when Bancroft “went for him with a potato peeler”. A retrial was ordered in January after the court of appeal overturned the original conviction as unsafe. Holgate told the jury the prosecution would have to establish Walker had intended to kill Bancroft or to cause her serious injury, and that such injuries were “a substantial and operating cause of her death”. “I decided that on one critical issue, namely causation, no jury could be sure that the prosecution had proved its case to the standard of proof required in a criminal trial,” he said. “For that reason, the issue of causation could not, as a matter of law, be left to the jury to decide, and so Mr Walker had to be acquitted of both murder and manslaughter.”",News/UK news,Gary Walker: ex-police officer freed after retrial over 2003 death of girlfriend,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/21/gary-walker-ex-police-officer-freed-after-retrial-over-2003-death-of-girlfriend
12/22/2021,"A long-serving football coach who is facing claims he raped, groomed and exploited young players has been arrested in Gabon on suspicion of sexual abuse. Patrick Assoumou Eyi – known as “Capello” – has been accused of abusing boys in his previous post as the head coach of Gabon’s under-17 team and in his current role as the technical director for La Ligue de l’Estuaire, the country’s highest league.  Eyi was arrested on Monday by police in Ntoum, 25 miles from the capital, Libreville. Last week he was provisionally suspended by Fegafoot, the Gabonese Football Federation, pending an investigation, after accusations by alleged victims were reported by the Guardian. Eyi did not respond to requests for comment from the Guardian before the publication of last week’s article. He has since denied the accusations against him and insisted that he was “a victim of my skills”. “I am not the man described to you, which is why in your investigations you will only find embittered, jealous people who live in the imagination,” he told the BBC. “What is happening in Gabonese football, can it be summed up by me alone?” Eyi has also been suspended from his role as general secretary of the AEEFG, Gabon’s Association of Football Coaches and Educators, pending the outcome of Fegafoot’s investigation. The government is to hold a judicial investigation into possible sexual abuse against children and young people in all sports in the country after the president, Ali Bongo, described the claims as “a very serious matter”. Since the Guardian’s article was published several more alleged victims have come forward to claim they were also abused by Eyi, with the former Gabon internationals Brice Makaya and Armand Ossey also claiming they were aware he had abused players. Makaya, a former striker who helped Gabon to qualify for their first Africa Cup of Nations in 1994 before serving as assistant coach to Eyi with the under-17s in 2014, said that he reported his concerns to Fegafoot that year but they were ignored. “Patrick Assoumou Eyi has repeatedly sexually assaulted children,” he told the Guardian. “Everyone inside Gabonese football was aware. I was a part of that system and I denounced his acts several times. I even denounced him several times to the federal bureau of Fegafoot.” In response, a statement from Fegafoot said: “The current executive committee was elected in March 2014. A few months later, the new executive committee put an end to the function of coach of Mr Assoumou Eyi and Brice Makaya. The latter never communicated accusations, suspicions, or denounced facts of this nature to the new executive committee.” Alleged victims of the coach have now been invited to submit their testimonies as part of an investigation being conducted by Fegafoot’s independent ethics committee – a process that will be open until 31 December. Ossey, another former striker who spent most of his career in France and represented Gabon at the Afcon in 2000, alleged Eyi’s abuse stretches back to the start of his career in the early 1990s when he coached regional youth sides. “I know Capello very well. He was close to getting me, I admit it,” he said. “Gabon is a small country, we all know who has done what. It is an open secret.” The players’ union, the National Association of Professional Footballers of Gabon, has also received testimonies from young alleged victims who claim to have been abused and is in the process of setting up support systems. Meanwhile, the Gabonese club Tout Puissant Akwembé have suspended their coach Orphé Mickala after he was accused on social media of sexually abusing young players.

Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, reassured the public that they would not have to change their Christmas Day plans as she appealed to everyone to reduce their social contact and stay at home as much as possible in advance of Christmas and after the festive weekend. Sturgeon told MSPs on Tuesday that further protections were necessary, including all outdoor events being limited to 500 people, and indoor events including concerts limited to 200 people seated, or 100 standing, with 1-metre physical distancing required for any events still going ahead. The Welsh government said all sporting events would be held behind closed doors from 26 December and introduced a legal requirement to work from home unless there was a reasonable excuse not to, accompanied by a £60 fixed penalty notice for workers and £1,000 fines for companies. The GMB union warned this would affect “the poorest, most vulnerable workers”, while the Wales TUC general secretary, Shavanah Taj, expressed “shock and concern” at the decision. Scotland’s new rules will hit the Old Firm derby between Celtic and Rangers on 2 January and large-scale Hogmanay street parties: Edinburgh’s was planned to go ahead at a reduced capacity of 30,000. Omicron cases have increased in Scotland by more than 50% in a week. Acknowledging the disappointment of those looking forward to such events, Sturgeon said: “The much higher transmissibility of Omicron means large gatherings have the potential to become very rapid super-spreader events, putting large numbers at risk of getting infected very quickly. Limiting these events helps reduce the risk of widespread transmission.” She said this would also cut down the transmission risks of fans travelling to and from matches. “And second, these large events put an additional burden on emergency services, especially the police and ambulance services,” she added. Her statement included some other changes:  Non-professional indoor contact sports for adults should not take place during the three-week period from 26 December.  A requirement for table service only will be reintroduced for venues serving alcohol for consumption on the premises.  Indoor hospitality and leisure venues will be asked to ensure 1-metre distancing between groups.  People meeting indoors at home or in hospitality or leisure venues should be in groups of no more than 3 households. Sturgeon told MSPs that the S-gene dropout indicator for the Omicron variant now accounted for 62.9% of all cases in Scotland, compared with 27.5% this time last week. While there were increases across all age groups, the biggest – of 161% – was in 20- to 24-year-olds. She said that staffing shortages were already putting additional strain on health and emergency services, adding that 100 Scotrail services were cancelled on Sunday because of staff absence. Sturgeon said that she was “acutely aware” that the latest restrictions, as well as the advice to avoid socialising, had significant financial implications for many businesses. However, she questioned whether the latest announcement of a £1bn bailout package for UK businesses by the Treasury generated “new” money for Scotland, rather than being an advance allocation of money already budgeted for.",News/World news,Scotland and Wales both act to tighten rules amid Omicron spread,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/21/scotland-cancels-hogmanay-events-in-move-to-slow-spread-of-omicron
12/22/2021,"In 1994 , a bungalow owner in Devon called pest control to report that a mysterious “white ant” had chomped through her conservatory. Investigations eventually revealed the culprit was in fact a colony of millions of subterranean termites, the first and only colony ever recorded on UK soil. The call marked the beginning of a 27-year saga involving hundreds of thousands of pounds of public money and considerable headaches for the property owner and her neighbours in Saunton on the north Devon coast.  Many experts thought the UK’s Termite Eradication Programme (TEP) was doomed to failure. Once imported, usually in something as innocent as a wooden wine crate or an antique pine wardrobe, the tenacious insects inevitably triumph and become endemic, thanks to their superior burying and reproduction skills. But now in Devon, human ingenuity and British bloody-mindedness have prevailed. After no signs of termite activity were detected for the past 10 years, the Saunton termite colony has officially been declared dead by a panel of international experts, saving the nation from a future where homeowners have to worry about termite infestations as well as wasp nests and rising damp. A final field inspection in May found no signs of termites in a zone 100 metres long and 30 metres deep, and the TEP is now in “decommissioning mode”, said Dr Ed Suttie, the termite terminator who has been involved with the TEP since it began in 1998 and has run it since 2003. No other country has ever won the termite war, he said: “It’s a world first.” There have been false dawns before in this battle of the beasties. Going into the new millennium there were no sightings of the termites for nine years. Then their beadlike antennae were again spotted rooting around in the soil, resulting in the eradication and monitoring programme being extended repeatedly until this year. The colony had made its home under two neighbouring bungalows, which were effectively condemned by the invaders. In 2012 one of the owners applied to demolish her property and start again, but was denied planning permission after a two-year battle. So crucial was the matter deemed to national biosecurity that the final decision was taken by the then communities secretary, Eric Pickles. He refused it on the grounds that the demolition and construction work could risk the termites spreading to a wider area, causing “potential catastrophic economic, environmental and social consequences”. A compromise was struck whereby she was allowed to build an annexe that Suttie says is “the UK’s only termite-proof building”. Burning down the infected buildings was not an option, he explained: “Termites were not actually living in the house – the wood in there was just their food source. They live underground, often many metres under the surface.” Suttie said both property owners had shown “amazing cooperation” over the decades, banned not just from most home improvement but also from removing any soil or wood from the site. They also had to let TEP officials plant “timber bait” in their gardens – essentially wooden stakes made out of aged pine, termites’ favourite food, which they could monitor for nibbles. Termite eradication involved the targeted deployment of “insect growth regulators”, a kind of hyper-intelligent insecticide that would stop the termites reaching maturity and reproducing. Had successive governments since 1998 not invested considerable amounts of public money in the effort, it could have been a very different story, said Suttie. Termites could have become endemic, eating their way through floor boards, door frames and beams across southern England, just as they do in Australia, parts of North America and southern Europe. The stakes are high: each year, termites cause more than $5bn (£3.8bn) in property damage in the US, according to the National Pest Management Association. Though the termites were first confirmed in Saunton in 1994, Suttie believes they may have been imported to the site as many as 70 years earlier: “Anecdotally, we’ve heard stories of gardeners referring to white ants and a greenhouse that had to be replaced.” Nick Harvey, who was the local Liberal Democrat MP from 1992 to 2015, remembers the “great anguish” of the bungalow owner who discovered the colony. His constituent believed a previous occupant had accidentally imported the termites in soil brought from the Canary Islands via some non-native plants, he said. Damian McBride, a special adviser to the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, who drew attention to the termite war in a Twitter thread, said he thought Suttie and others should be given honours for their unglamorous but essential public service. “What’s the moral of the story?” he asked. “You can make up your own, but for me, this is public service in its finest form – unseen, largely unknown and rarely heralded – but done with selfless dedication year after year simply because of what would happen to the rest of us if it wasn’t.” In forests and grasslands of their native tropics, termites are regarded as “soil engineers” that are vital to the maintenance of soil structure and ecosystem balance, according to BRE, which has run the government’s Termite Eradication Programme since 1998. But imported into urban environments, they are considered pests because of their ability to severely damage timber in buildings. Subterranean termites – the kind that caused havoc in north Devon – are now endemic in southern Europe, thanks to globalisation and the warming climate. If you live in a termite-infested area in France, you must, by law, supply a “termite-free” certificate when you sell a house and any building work must be certified termite-proof. Much of the UK is too wet for a subterranean termite colony to establish. But unluckily for the bungalow owners in Saunton, their properties were built on very light, sandy and well-draining soil among maritime pine trees that termites love. The houses were also built using a lot of pine timber, a delicacy for the greedy insects, which can chomp away undetected for months, hollowing out wood from the inside. Sometimes mistaken for white ants, worker termites are typically 4-6mm in length, are pale or whitish in colour, have beadlike antennae and lack a “waist” (a constriction of the first or second abdominal segments). A colony can form in the space of a match box but can be vastly bigger, as in the Devon case, comprising numerous “mud tubes” or tunnels that connect food sources and nesting sites.",News/UK news,‘A world first’: Devon calls victory in 27-year war on termites,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/21/a-world-first-devon-calls-victory-in-27-year-war-on-termites
12/22/2021,"John Harris’s article (The fatal weakness of the Conservatives is not seeing the kindness in most people, 19 December) carried the evergreen quote of the Brittania Unchained (definitely not Unhinged) group: “Once they enter the workplace, the British are among the worst idlers in the world.” Your photograph showed employees of the public in the Downing Street garden, standing around chatting, with wine and cheese at hand, at a claimed “work meeting”. Having retired from the NHS, where consuming alcohol on hospital property was forbidden due do its effect on professional performance, and where late working hours meant working flat out into the next morning rather than just a balmy evening, I applaud the prime minister for promulgating the view of the Brittania Unhinged group even at the very heart of government.Dr Jonathan J RossSheffield  I was 18 when I first walked on to a Covid ward. I began the year studying cells and chemistry with my friends in sixth form and I ended it donning scrubs on my own in a small staff toilet preparing to cross the red line. I sat in the corner as a nurse asked if a family wanted to be taught how to put on PPE so they could see their daughter. “No,” they replied. They had done this many times before. Today was goodbye.  Later that morning, in a sombre silence broken only by the buzzing and beeping of life-saving equipment, I assisted in taking a woman to the mortuary. This was my fourth trip of the day, but this time I noticed that the patient’s tag said she was scarcely much older than me. I took my break alone, to keep myself and others safe. That evening, I bought myself a pizza and ate it in a car park by the sea. The police promptly came and told me to go home. Perhaps I should have worn a suit and said it was a work meeting.Louis SandersonExeter, Devon  Thank you for your photo of the Downing Street party. Earlier on, I wrote to the Independent Police Complaints Commission urging it to investigate the Met’s behaviour in failing to investigate possible Covid breaches. Alas, it appears I can’t complain. Today it emailed me, saying: “In order to be eligible you must be either, a person directly affected by police conduct, a person who was adversely affected by police conduct or a person who witnessed the conduct at first hand. Any person who is aware of police conduct through a third party or, through a medium such as television, will neither be a witness, nor can they be adversely effected.” So despite the picture raising my blood pressure further, there is nothing I can do.Margaret SquiresSt Andrews, Fife  If this meeting was a work meeting, why was the future Mrs Johnson present?

12/22/2021,"Is it necessary to carry a diagnostic label simply to know oneself? Joanna Moorhead’s article suggests so, and this is a great shame (A lot fell into place’: the adults who discovered they were autistic – after their child was diagnosed, 16 December). Neurodiversity entails acceptance and, in its purest form, is inseparable from acceptance of human cognitive diversity in general. The very proposition that some individuals are categorically neurodiverse while others are not would fly in the face of the central tenet of neurodiversity, which denies that there can be any one normative or healthy type of brain or mind. Neurodiversity as a trait could only apply, therefore, to society as a whole, and not as a discriminant of individuals. I’m glad for the parents described in the article who have gained acceptance from employers, from spouses and from themselves by identifying with the autistic traits that they see in their children. But acceptance and reasonable accommodation of individual differences in cognition and behaviour ought to be the moral right of every human being, whether or not their particular differences fall under a diagnostic classification. And the danger of an overly broad application of the diagnostic term “autism” as a descriptor of human diversity in general (“increased diagnosis is good for everyone”) is that those whose autism profoundly limits their ability to communicate and to feel in charge of their senses, thoughts, feelings and behaviour might not be recognised as having very distinct needs for support.  Why do we need labels to be nice to each other, and to ourselves? Let’s leave the “autism” label for those who need it most.Matthew BelmonteSheffield  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?
