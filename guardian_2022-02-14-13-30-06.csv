2/14/2022,"What began as a daily slice of bliss is in danger of turning into something of a strain, some say. Some players of the viral word game Wordle have complained that it has become harder since it was bought by the New York Times late last month.  The addictive online game swept the internet over the past few weeks, capturing the hearts and minds of millions, before it was quickly secured by the news giant for an undisclosed seven-figure sum. But several Wordle players have said they feel that it’s getting more difficult to guess the target word. “It must be a coincidence, but the NY Times puzzles are hard and suddenly Wordle has questionable words,” author and columnist Anna Spargo-Ryan tweeted over the weekend. It must be a coincidence, but the NY Times puzzles are hard and suddenly Wordle has questionable words “Is it me or has Wordle got so much harder since NYT took it over?” fellow author Michelle Elman asked. Dr Kirstin Ferguson, a researcher and writer, also questioned the recent change, asking: “The words seem a little harder since the move to NYT … or maybe I am imagining it?” Wordle 239 4/6🟩⬜🟨⬜⬜🟩🟨⬜⬜⬜🟩⬜🟨🟩⬜🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩The words seem a little harder since the move to NYT (or maybe I am imagining it?).I like the challenge so harder the better.

People may be seeing “a pattern where they may not be any and maybe in the backend something could be different with the sale to the New York Times … but we don’t know”. Webb acknowledged that with the puzzle’s transfer to the New York Times, the publication may want to “put their mark on it”, adding: “You’d have to imagine they’d be some element of curation there.” “It could be harder, they could have changed something, we don’t know. But even if they haven’t changed anything … open a dictionary at a random page and you will find a five-letter word in English you don’t know,” he added. The New York Times has denied any changes have been made to Wordle since the acquisition. “Nothing has changed about the game play,” New York Times communications director Jordan Cohen said in an email. Created by a Brooklyn-based Reddit engineer Josh Wardle and launched in mid-October, Wordle gives players just six guesses to determine a five-letter word that changes every day. With the “elegance of a daily newspaper puzzle”, the game’s simplicity is its charm. Wardle, who designed the game for his puzzle-loving partner, recently spoke of feeling overwhelmed by the game’s viral success. “It going viral doesn’t feel great, to be honest. I feel a sense of responsibility for the players. I feel I really owe it to them to keep things running and make sure everything’s working correctly,” Wardle said. Worldle’s popularity continues to rise. From 90 daily players in November to 300,000 at the beginning of January, the game is thought to have now attracted nearly 3 million players across the world.",News/Media,Is Wordle getting harder?

2/14/2022,"The New South Wales health department is seeking to block the nurses union from taking part in state-wide strike action, arguing it would pose “a risk to employee and public health and safety”. On Monday the secretary of NSW Health filed a notice of dispute in the Industrial Relations Commission seeking to head off the planned Nurses and Midwives Association strike that will see hundreds of health workers protest outside the state’s parliament when it resumes on Tuesday. It is the first statewide strike action planned by NSW nurses in 10 years.  A conciliation hearing between the two parties was continuing on Monday afternoon, as well as negotiations over nurses’ demands for stricter nurse-to-patient ratios and a 2.5% increase in pay. Despite ongoing negotiations, a lawyer for the nurses’ union told the IRC discussions had not resulted in a resolution which would “go any way to satisfying the association the real concerns of nurses are being addressed”. “Therefore it looks likely [the industrial action] will go ahead tomorrow,” the union’s lawyer told the commission. The department launched the court action arguing the strike would place too high a burden on hospitals and endanger public safety. “Should the strike action occur it will cause significant disruption to the safe staffing of health facilities and presenting a risk to employee and public health and safety,” the court notification read. Union officials met with department and ministerial officials on Monday to discuss the demands from nurses and midwives ahead of the strike. NSWNMA assistant general secretary Shaye Candish said the government had not meet the association’s requests. “He [health minister Brad Hazzard] is interested in continuing to talk,” she said. “I’m not as convinced that he’s interested in solutions but we’ll wait to see. “We’re very happy to continue talking but we want to start to see solutions.” She said it was most likely the strike would go ahead. “If the health minister presented to a meeting today with no commitment or capacity to offer anything that will bring the strike to a close, I can’t imagine that the commission is going to be able to do so,” she said. Candish said nurses had been under significant pressure even before the pandemic and the situation for many was now unbearable. “It’s an incredibly challenging time,” she said. “We’re coming through the downturn of the [Omicron] peak now and we still have members who are routinely working double shifts, multiple overtime shifts per week.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Speaking on ABC radio on Monday morning, NSW treasurer Matt Kean said the demands being made by nurses had been reasonable. “The demands that the nurses are making are very reasonable,” he said. “We greatly respect their work and we’ll work through them in the appropriate process. “We want to make sure that we listen to what they’re saying and that we put forward the best offer that’s in the state’s interest and in the nurses’ interest.” Last week NSW premier Dominic Perrottet said setting nurse-to-patient ratios “hasn’t actually worked so well in other states”. Speaking on Monday, he said it was “unlikely” a resolution would be reached before tomorrow, but that his government would continue working with officials. “We want to reach resolution and the sooner we reach resolution, the better,” he said. The department has been contacted for comment.",News/Australia news,NSW government seeks to block first statewide nurses’ strike in 10 years ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/14/nsw-government-seeks-to-block-first-statewide-nurses-strike-in-10-years
2/14/2022,"The Los Angeles Rams have been accused of trading away their future to build a team of superstars, but their fans are unlikely to care when the present looks this good. Six years after the team returned to California – after a 20-year sojourn in St Louis – the Rams are Super Bowl champions for the second time in their history. Their last title-winning team was led by a turbocharged offense known as The Greatest Show On Turf. This victory was a lot grittier but just as welcome.  Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford arrived in Los Angeles last March after spending the entirety of his career in the football wasteland of Detroit. The Rams hoped that he was the final piece in a team of stars that would push them to their first championship since the 1999 season. He certainly looked the part early on in this game. On his first throw of the game, he connected on a short pass to Cam Akers for a first down. But the drive fizzled out and it was the Bengals’ chance to make an early impression. It had taken Stafford 13 years to reach his first Super Bowl. His opposite number, Joe Burrow, had arrived here in just his second in the league. Like Stafford, he completed his first pass. The Bengals, showing the confidence of a team that had already beaten the No 1 seeded Tennessee Titans and fearsome Kansas City Chiefs to get to Sunday’s game, elected to go for it on fourth-down at midfield. Burrow couldn’t complete his pass though and the Rams took over with excellent field position. That was enough of an opportunity for Stafford. He connected with Cooper Kupp for 20 yards and then found Odell Beckham Jr with a 17-yard strike for a touchdown. Beckham tore into the NFL as a rookie in 2014, famous for his spectacular athleticism and ability to pull off breathtaking catches. In recent years he had been judged as little more than a walking distraction and, like Stafford, a player whose reputation fell short of his output. But the two men had given their team a vital early advantage, particularly when their formidable defensive line and star cornerback Jalen Ramsey are capable of shutting down opposing offenses. It was Ramsey who broke up a would-be touchdown pass for the Bengals on third-down at the end of the first quarter. Evan McPherson kicked the ensuing field goal to make it 7-3 and the Bengals were on the board. Stafford had supplied Beckham with a touchdown and he went to his other top receiver, Kupp, for his second. The 28-year-old had clocked up 1,947 receiving yards in the regular season, the second-highest total in NFL history, and few of his catches were easier than this one as he found himself free of any coverage in the end zone. Burrow’s favorite target throughout this season has been his old college teammate, Ja’Marr Chase. But neither player was involved in the Bengals’ opening touchdown, which came on their next drive. Running back Joe Mixon showed off his arm, finding Tee Higgins with a six-yard pass and the score was 13-10. It was the first time a running back had thrown a touchdown in a Super Bowl since 1980. Stafford was playing flawlessly but even when he’s at his best the siren song of an inadvisable pass is never far away. He duly delivered on the Rams’ next possession. At the Cincinnati 43-yard line he heaved it into the end zone and Jessie Bates leapt in front of Van Jefferson, who could have fought harder for the catch, to make the pick. The teams went into half-time separated by a field goal but the game so far had not gone as most had predicted. The Rams defensive line, led by one-man wrecking crew, Aaron Donald, had been expected to tear into a Bengals offensive line that had failed to protect Burrow for much of the last two seasons. But Burrow was enjoying more time to find his targets than he was used to. And that point was backed up with the first play of the second-half. Burrow danced around the pocket, Higgins lost Ramsey with far too much ease for the Rams’ liking, scooped up the pass, and scampered away for a 75-yard touchdown. The Bengals had the lead for the first time in the game, 17-13. Stafford, meanwhile, was reverting to type: a spectacular start followed by an impressive implosion. A knee injury had ended Beckham’s game which meant more snaps for Ben Skowronek, a rookie with just 11 career receptions. Stafford attempted to find him with his first throw of the half, but was slightly off target and Skowronek deflected it into the welcoming arms of Chidobe Awuzie. That led to a second field goal from McPherson and one in reply for the Rams to make it 20-16. As the game wore on, the defenses started to take control. Stafford was shaken up on a sack by DJ Reader, then Burrow was brought down twice on the ensuing Bengals’ possession. Stafford had led 34 fourth quarter comebacks during his career and he would need to make it 35 as the Rams entered the final stanza trailing by four points. Crucially, his defense was continuing to harry Burrow as the Bengals offensive line tired. With less than two minutes left, the Rams drove to the Bengals’ one-yard line, with help from a series of penalties on the Bengals. This is what the Rams had traded for when they acquired Stafford: a quarterback who could push them over the line when it mattered. He duly wheeled out and threw a touchdown pass to Kupp. The Rams were three points up with 85 second to play. Now, it was Burrow’s time to lead his team. He had shown a cool head in crucial situations throughout the playoffs but by now the Rams’ defensive line were rampant. Appropriately it was Donald, arguably the most talented player in the entire league, who sacked Burrow on fourth down to seal the 23-20 victory.",Sport/Sport,LA Rams clinch second Super Bowl title in nail-biter,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/13/la-rams-clinch-second-super-bowl-title-in-nail-biter
2/14/2022,"The UK will need nearly 230,000 new rental homes to avoid a shortfall if the current growth in demand continues, according to a new forecast. Private rented sector supply will have to increase by 227,000 homes a year to meet the demand for 1.8 million new households over the next decade, according to analysis by the consultancy Capital Economics.  The UK has faced a persistent shortage of new housing, adding to soaring house-price growth, with many people being forced to rent for longer. The number of households in the UK private rented sector increased from 2.8 million in 2007 to 4.5 million in 2017, according to official figures. Private rents in Britain rose at their fastest rate on record in January and average advertised rent outside London was 9.9% higher than a year ago, according to data from property website Rightmove. The government took a series of steps to remove tax relief for buy-to-let landlords after hundreds of thousands joined the rush to buy second or third properties. As well as the tax relief, landlords have benefited in the last decade from ultra-low interest rates and capital gains from rising house prices. Andrew Evans, managing economist at Capital Economics, who was commissioned to carry out the study by the lobby group National Residential Landlords Association (NRLA), said “a series of policy changes” had reduced the stock of rental properties in the UK. He added that “supply could fall by over half a million more over the next decade” if no changes are made. Ben Beadle, chief executive of the NRLA, said there was a “supply crisis now engulfing the sector” and that “urgent action” was needed to provide affordable rental housing. A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, said: “We support the private rented sector and recognise the crucial role build-to-rent homes have in boosting housing supply, and increasing quality and choice for renters across the country. “This government is building more genuinely affordable homes to help people on to the housing ladder. Since 2010, we have delivered more than 574,000 affordable homes and we are investing £11.5bn in affordable housing.”",News/Business,"UK needs 230,000 new rental homes to meet growing demand",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/14/uk-needs-230000-rental-homes-meet-demand
2/14/2022,"Saudi Arabia has transferred shares worth $80bn to its sovereign wealth fund as the oil-rich nation hopes to rival Norway and Singapore’s state-managed funds and invest in green projects. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, said 4% of shares in Saudi Aramco, the world’s biggest oil exporter, would be transferred to the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund as part of efforts to recalibrate the oil-dominated economy.  The transfer is the latest sign that Saudi Arabia wants to open up the oil giant and “crown jewel” of the Saudi economy, the Arab world’s largest. The crown prince, who was blamed by the US for sanctioning the murder of the Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi, was quoted as saying the “transfer of 4% of Aramco shares to the Public Investment Fund (PIF) … is part of the kingdom’s long-term strategy to support the restructuring of its economy”. He said the kingdom wants the investment fund to have $1tn in assets by the end of 2025. The fund, the centrepiece of official moves to end economic reliance on oil, had less than half that amount before this deal. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the world’s largest, said last month it earned a return of 14% on its $1.3tn of investments, much of it from the sale of state-owned oil supplies. Singapore’s Temasek investment fund is worth more than $300bn. Crown Prince Mohammed stressed that the Saudi state would remain the dominant Aramco shareholder with a 94% stake. He is also head of the sovereign PIF. Aramco shares finished down by 0.6% in Sunday trading after the announcement. But experts said the share switch would strengthen the sovereign fund. The oil giant raised $6bn in Islamic bonds in June last year so that it could pay dividends to the new shareholders. But Aramco announced $30.4bn in profits for the third quarter of 2021, a massive rise from $18.8bn for the same quarter the previous year, as oil prices took off again.",News/Business,Saudi Arabia transfers $80bn in shares to wealth fund for green projects,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/13/saudi-arabia-transfers-80bn-shares-sovereign-fund-green-projects
