5/17/2022,"A graduating student at Duke University faced heavy criticism after delivering a commencement address that shared “striking similarities” with a Harvard University graduation speech from 2014.

During her commencement ceremony on May 8, speaker Priya Parkash called her school “the Duke nation” and said it could become its own country due to its various associations and landmarks.

Parkash, who is originally from Pakistan, said that “if Duke were to dig a moat around its perimeter and fill that with water, it could be its own tiny island nation, like Cuba or maybe even Sri Lanka.”

 

Duke’s student newspaper The Chronicle would later point out that several metaphors and rhetoric from Parkash’s speech have similarities to those from a previous commencement address at Harvard.

During her speech for Harvard’s Class of 2014, Sarah Abushaar mentioned “the Harvard nation” and declared that her university could be its own country if it “shut its gates.”

The Chronicle highlighted other lines from the two speeches that are seemingly too identical to be mere coincidence.

Abushaar, who was raised in Kuwait, said that her campus’ statue of John Harvard is Harvard’s own Statue of Liberty, while the Harvard Alumni Association is its tax collection agency. Abushaar also noted that her university’s endowment is “larger than more than half of the world's countries' GDPs.”

Meanwhile, Parkash compared Duke’s statue of James Buchanan Duke to Christ the Redeemer, the iconic statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro. She also compared the Duke Alumni Association to a tax collection agency, noting that Duke’s endowment is “larger than the GDP of one third of the countries in the world.”

In both speeches, the speakers said their time at their respective universities gave them “diplomatic passports,” which helped them pass through U.S. immigration without any issues. Additionally, wearing university gear no longer made them a “national security threat” at the airport.

“I made sure I dressed like our overly proud Harvard dads, with Harvard hat, Harvard shirt, Harvard shorts and Harvard underwear,” Abushaar shared.

“I would be sure to raid the Duke store like our overly enthusiastic Duke moms and dads sitting here today,” Parkash said in her speech. “We’re talking Duke cap, Duke sweatshirt, Duke sweatpants, Duke sunglasses, Duke slides and even Duke underwear.”

After successfully passing U.S. immigration, Abushar noted that “suddenly all the gates to the American Dream opened wide.” Meanwhile, Parkash said that “the doors to this whole new world of possibilities flung wide open.”

Michael Schoenfeld, Duke University’s vice president for public affairs and government relations, sent a statement to The Chronicle acknowledging the allegations and noted that they have “initiated a process to understand the facts of the situation.""

""Duke expects all students to abide by their commitment to the Duke Community Standard in everything they do as students,"" he added.

On May 11, Parkash released a statement acknowledging the similarities between the two speeches, which she attributed to “suggested passages” by “respected friends and family.”

“When I was asked to give the commencement speech, I was thrilled by such an honor and I sought advice from respected friends and family about topics I might address,” Parkash wrote. “I was embarrassed and confused to find out too late that some of the suggested passages were taken from a recent commencement speech at another university. I take full responsibility for this oversight and I regret if this incident has in any way distracted from the accomplishments of the Duke class of 2022.”

Abushaar also released a statement via The Crimson, noting that she hopes Parkash can use the “serious error in judgment” as an “opportunity to learn and grow.”

“The goal of my address was to inspire young people, and especially young women, from all backgrounds to break barriers in striving for their aims and to have the courage to use their voices to share their stories and serve as forces of good,” she said.

5/17/2022,"(Adds Zelenskiy quote; details from Ukrainian military, deputy defence minister) * Ukrainian forces evacuate from Mariupol plant * Ukraine regiment says it is saving lives of troops inside * Evacuees arrive in Russian-controlled town * Putin responds calmly to Finland, Sweden NATO move By Natalia Zinets KYIV/MARIUPOL, Ukraine, May 16 (Reuters) - Troops holed up in the last Ukrainian stronghold in the besieged port of Mariupol began evacuating on Monday, appearing to cede control of the once prosperous city to Russia after months of bombardment. Ukraine's deputy defence minister said 53 injured troops from the Azovstal steelworks were taken to a hospital in the Russian-controlled town of Novoazovsk, some 32 kilometres (20 miles) to the east. Another 211 people were taken to the town of Olenivka, in an area controlled by Russian-backed separatists, Deputy Defence Minister Anna Malyar said. All of the evacuees will be subject to a potential prisoner exchange with Russia, she added. Reuters saw five buses carrying troops from Azovstal arrive in Novoazovsk late on Monday. Some of the evacuated troops were wounded and carried out of the buses on stretchers. Some 600 troops were believed to have been inside the steel plant. ""We hope that we will be able to save the lives of our guys,"" Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a late night address. ""There are severely wounded ones among them. They're receiving care. Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive."" Ukraine's military said it had ""ordered the commanders of the units stationed at Azovstal to save the lives of the personnel"" and that troops there had fulfilled their combat mission. Efforts to rescue troops still inside were under way, the military added. It did not say how many troops remained. Ukrainian troops say they held out in Azovstal for 82 days, buying time for the rest of Ukraine to battle Russian forces and secure Western arms needed to withstand Russia's assault. But the evacuation likely marked the end of the longest and bloodiest battle of the Ukraine war and a significant defeat for Ukraine. Mariupol is now in ruins after a Russian siege that Ukraine says killed tens of thousands of people in the city. Since Russia launched its invasion in February, Mariupol's devastation has become a symbol both of Ukraine's ability to withstand Russia's invasion and of Russia's willingness to devastate Ukrainian cities that hold out. The evacuation came hours after Russia said it had agreed to evacuate wounded Ukrainian soldiers to a medical facility in Novoazovsk. Azovstal's last defenders had been holding out for weeks in bunkers and tunnels built deep underground to withstand nuclear war. Civilians were evacuated from inside the plant, one of the largest metallurgical facilities in Europe, earlier this month. The wife of an Azov Regiment member described conditions at the plant earlier on Monday: ""They are in hell. They receive new wounds every day. They are without legs or arms, exhausted, without medicines,"" Natalia Zaritskaya said. PUTIN CLIMBDOWN OVER NATO Russian President Vladimir Putin appeared earlier on Monday to climb down from threats to retaliate against Sweden and Finland for announcing plans to join the U.S.-led NATO military alliance. ""As far as expansion goes, including new members Finland and Sweden, Russia has no problems with these states - none. And so in this sense there is no immediate threat to Russia from an expansion to include these countries,"" Putin said. The comments appeared to mark a major shift in rhetoric, after years of casting NATO enlargement as a direct threat to Russia's security, including citing it as a justification for the invasion of Ukraine itself. Just hours before Putin spoke, Russia's deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said Finland and Sweden were making a mistake that would have far-reaching consequences: ""They should have no illusions that we will simply put up with it."" Putin said NATO enlargement was being used by the United States in an ""aggressive"" way to aggravate an already difficult global security situation, and that Russia would respond if the alliance moves weapons or troops forward. ""The expansion of military infrastructure into this territory would certainly provoke our response. What that (response) will be - we will see what threats are created for us,"" Putin said. Finland and Sweden, both non-aligned throughout the Cold War, say they now want the protection offered by NATO's treaty, under which an attack on any member is an attack on all. ""We are leaving one era behind us and entering a new one,"" Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said, announcing plans to formally abandon militarily non-aligned status - a cornerstone of national identity for more than 200 years. Kjell Engelbrekt, professor of political science at the Swedish Defence University, said Moscow now had few military options left to follow through on its previous ""very assertive"" rhetoric demanding the Nordics never join NATO. A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington had seen no indications Russia was moving troops or equipment closer to the border with Finland. UKRAINE TROOPS REACH BORDER Moscow calls its invasion a ""special military operation"" to rid Ukraine of fascists, an assertion Kyiv and its Western allies say is a baseless pretext for an unprovoked war. Nearly three months old, Russia's invading forces have run into apparent setbacks, with troops forced out of the north and the environs of Kyiv in late March. A Ukrainian counterattack in recent days has driven Russian forces out of the area near Kharkiv, the biggest city in the east. Ukraine's defence ministry said on Monday troops had advanced all the way to the Russian border, about 40 km north of Kharkiv. The successes near Kharkiv could let Ukraine attack supply lines for Russia's own main offensive, grinding on further south in the Donbas region, where Moscow has been launching mass assaults for a month yet achieving only small gains. In a video message, Zelenskiy hailed the achievement and thanked the troops: ""I am very grateful to you from all Ukrainians, from everyone, from myself, from my family, my gratitude is unlimited.""

Cortes appeared to be quoting rap lyrics in at least some of the tweets, and he did not seem to be using the words to demean anyone directly. “I felt like it wasn't the right message that I wanted to send out, when I was 17 years old,"" Cortes said before Monday's game against Baltimore. ""Those happened 10 years ago. I deactivated my Twitter to clean stuff up.” “It's not acceptable,"" he added. ""I think I could have managed myself and said stuff differently.
