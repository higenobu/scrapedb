2/28/2022,"The UK government is considering restricting Russian ships from using British ports after it emerged that a Russian-owned oil tanker is due to dock in Orkney this week. The NS Champion, operated by Sovcomflot, a large shipping company majority-owned by the Russian state, is due to berth at Flotta oil terminal in Orkney on Tuesday to collect crude oil. To the dismay of politicians and islanders – including Ukrainian residents who attended an anti-war demonstration on Saturday in the archipelago’s largest town, Kirkwall – Orkney Islands council said the UK government had advised that at present the vessel cannot be refused permission to dock. “As a council we are in an extremely difficult position,” a spokesperson said. “We recognise the strength of feeling around this – feelings that we share – but we are bound by our legal obligations to accept the vessel, until such a time as the UK government tells us otherwise.” A UK government spokesperson indicated there were a number of Russian vessels scheduled to dock at British ports, despite the intensifying trade embargos against Russian businesses and state entities. Last week, the French impounded a Russian cargo ship carrying cars suspected of being linked to Russians targeted by sanctions implemented by the US Treasury Department. “We are aware of concerns about Russian-connected ships potentially docking in the UK and we are working rapidly to explore a range of measures to restrict access for them,” the spokesperson said. “We are already discussing this issue with the Scottish government and the sanctions being considered are part of a wider package being worked up across the UK government.” Angus Robertson, the Scottish government’s external affairs secretary, told BBC Scotland’s Sunday Show: “The UK authorities have got a big decision to take, on whether we are going to allow Russian-owned or charted vessels to dock in UK ports. “[This] is a very fast-moving situation and we’re going to have to act decisively in my view.” At Saturday’s protest against the invasion, Nataliia Kuzmina, a Ukrainian living in Orkney, told the BBC she was angered that the vessel may arrive. She said her parents remained in Ukraine and her father had volunteered to fight to defend their town but did not have any weapons. “Every little thing matters now. Hundreds of people around Europe will do some small act like this, stopping buying Russian products, stopping tankers being filled up with oil,” she said. “It matters and I feel it’s my duty to turn away this tanker from Scapa Flow.” Jamie Halcro Johnston, a Scottish Conservative MSP for the Highlands and Islands, said he discussed the issue with Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, on Saturday morning; Jack said it had been raised with the prime minister’s office. “The United Kingdom has already closed our airspace to Russian airlines, and our waters should be closed to Russian state-owned shipping too,” Halcro Johnston said. “It is important that, given the actions already taken against Putin’s regime and its interests, we ensure there are no loopholes left available to be exploited by Russian state interests.”",News/Business,UK considers banning Russian ships from British ports,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/27/uk-considers-banning-russian-ships-from-british-ports
2/28/2022,"To the outside, the adulation that Leeds United supporters hold for Marcelo Bielsa may appear strange, bordering on fanatical, perhaps even delusional. But to those who have followed his every move over four exhilarating years at Elland Road, his departure leaves a hole not only in the dugout but also in the heart. In Chile, they call themselves “widows of Bielsa”. The same sentiment can be found at Marseille and Athletic Bilbao, teams who look back on the Argentinian’s time with wide eyes and palpable nostalgia. Leeds are at the beginning of this undoubtedly painful process, coming to terms with life post-Bielsa, a life that will never quite be the same again. Discussing a football manager in such reverential terms might seem hyperbolic. However, what Bielsa has done for the club and the city in many ways transcends sport. He is a man who sees the corporate, avaricious, sportswashing modern game for what it is, yet managed to navigate his way through it all and still hold on to his principles: decency, humility and an unwavering work ethic. Without wishing to get too existential, he has made fans question why they bother watching football in the first place. Is it for trophies? Not unless you follow a cabal of elite clubs. Is it about nicking a goal and holding on for a result? You might as well go balance the books in the boardroom. Is it about entertainment, identity and sticking two fingers up at anyone who calls you reckless? You bet. It’s why Leeds supporters were still singing his name even after the poor performances that resulted in his cruel sacking. It’s why Leeds supporters will sing his name long after he has gone. It’s why England midfielder Kalvin Phillips wrote on Sunday: “You saw in me what I didn’t even see in myself.” In many ways, the rise of Phillips embodies all the work Bielsa has done. Like most of the squad he inherited in 2018, Phillips was drifting, searching for his role in a team of misfiring misfits flailing for land in the bottom half of the Championship. Stuart Dallas was half the player he is now, Mateusz Klich was deemed surplus to the extent he had been shipped out by the previous regime on loan to Utrecht. Within seven weeks of pre-season training, Bielsa transformed the group into an entirely new team. They were comfortable on the ball, played one- and two-touch cushions all over the pitch, and never stopped running. It was as if someone had finally found the mains supply at Elland Road, plugging the old ground directly into the Northern Northern Powergrid and sending a surge of voltage pulsing through brains and bones. New players have joined, but the team that currently hovers over the Premier League relegation zone still holds core members of the first game against Stoke City. If loyalty has proved to be the undoing of Bielsa, it is surely a fatal flaw worth celebrating. For all his idiosyncrasies, his trips to Costa Coffee and Morrisons, his former flat above a Wetherby sweet shop, what shone brightest was Bielsa’s humble perspective. During the pandemic, when Leeds lost many club legends and the whole world faced a daunting new reality, it was a comfort to many that a man of integrity was leading the club. Throughout his reign Bielsa never criticised a referee, never blamed VAR or spoke in negative terms about any individual. When “Spygate” rumbled on he publicly chastised himself and paid the fine out of his own pocket. He was a man you wanted in your corner when life was out of control. Bielsa was the best possible manager for Leeds at the best possible time. After so many years of stagnation, years of waste and anger, he proved the perfect antidote. In the early days there were constant fears that he would simply leave, that the Leeds curse would snare him, yet he stuck to his beliefs even after a catastrophic end to his first season. And it wasn’t the grenade-wielding, pitch-invading Bielsa of his youth. It was a man who knew this may be the last major test of his guiding principles, a final shot at showing the world how football should be played. Rarely can there ever have been a greater connection between supporters and manager. More than anything, he has allowed fans to dream again. His sacking doesn’t simply feel like the loss of a genius manager, rather, the loss of an old friend. So long, El Loco.",Sport/Football,"Marcelo Bielsa transformed Leeds with decency, humility and hard work",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/27/marcelo-bielsa-transformed-leeds-with-decency-humility-and-hard-work
2/28/2022,"Good morning. Residents of south-east Queensland face more rain today amid a worsening floods crisis. Schools will be closed in 13 local government areas and locals warned against nonessential travel. And major European countries are buying arms for Ukraine. Major flood warnings are in place for areas from Gympie to Grafton in northern NSW, while flood waters in the Brisbane CBD are expected to peak at 4.0 metres at high tide. Seven people have been killed due to the flood crisis and at least one person is missing. In some parts of Brisbane, flooding and damage has already been more severe than the 2011 floods, with residents caught off guard by the sudden flood water. An estimated 1,400 households were affected by a “rain bomb” and localised storms have made it difficult to predict where will be hit next. Some locals have had a lucky escape. Lloyd and Jean Warr survived flash flooding in 2011 by climbing on to their roof and on Friday they narrowly escaped with their lives once again by huddling together on top of their ute. Meanwhile, Peter Dutton is under fire for setting up a GoFundMe page for a flood-affected Queensland community. Labor frontbencher Josh Wilson suggested it proved the Coalition was incompetent and couldn’t deliver commonwealth support, but Scott Morrison says he did “not understand” the backlash. Vladimir Putin has ordered his military to put Russia’s nuclear deterrence forces on high alert in response to what he called “aggressive statements” by Nato countries. Volodymyr Zelenskiy says Ukraine has agreed to peace talks with Russia “without preconditions”. Kyiv remains in Ukrainian control, while officials claim they had repelled an attack on Kharkiv, the country’s second-largest city. The European Union will purchase weapons for Ukraine, with plans to spend €450m in EU funds on weapons and €50m on other items including medical supplies. Western allies have agreed to block Russia’s access to the Swift international banking payment system. Australia will provide funds for “lethal aid” to Ukraine’s war effort. Scott Morrison said “nothing is off the table” in response to the Russian invasion. Australia’s commitment was previously restricted to non-lethal military equipment, but on Sunday, Morrison said the government would increase its financial support to Nato to fund the supply of weapons for Ukrainian forces. “Russia must pay a heavy price … and we will continue to add to that price, as we consider every single option that is in front of us,” he said. Meanwhile, the Kremlin-backed RT channel has been suspended by Foxtel in Australia, after the channel reported that Russian troops are trying to liberate Ukraine. The EU will also remove RT and Sputnik channels in a move against the Kremlin media machine. Jack Moulos held deep family bonds but late-stage dementia and lockdown separation made his time in aged care even harder before he died from Covid. His family have remembered his life and the challenges of the circumstances of his death, in which one daughter stood in full PPE to view his body through a glass door, and the rest of his Sydney family were confined to their homes with Covid-19. A thinktank linked to technology giant Canon is under pressure to remove multiple “dangerous” articles and a book aimed at school-age children that describes the climate crisis as “fake news” and compares campaigner Greta Thunberg to a communist. While swift parrot numbers plunge, their Tasmanian breeding grounds are still being logged. It’s a recipe for extinction, experts say. A new report released by BirdLife Australia, the Wilderness Society and the Tasmanian group the Tree Projects says the primary cause is the loss of large, hollow-bearing trees used for breeding. Leaked documents have revealed telecoms giant Ericsson is alleged to have helped pay bribes to the Islamic State to continue selling its services after the militants seized control of large parts of Iraq. The company’s internal investigators uncovered allegations it was involved in corruption in at least 10 countries. The Iranian ambassador to the UK will be removed from his post after a video circulated showing an embassy reception at which some women did not have their heads covered. US members of Congress who spoke at a white nationalist event in Florida this week are “morons” with no place in the Republican party, Mitt Romney said. Puppetry experienced a golden age in the 1980s and 90s – and the children of that era enjoyed some deeply unsettling and downright grotty characters. Angharad Lodwick takes a look back at 10 of the worst puppets on Australian children’s television. “Not even puppets are immune from a #MeToo moment, and although Agro’s design itself wasn’t especially concerning (full eyebrows are very fashionable), his sexual harassment of his female co-hosts certainly was.” PTSD can untether a person from a stable sense of self. Treatment is all about gaining acceptance of the fragility and unpredictability of life, writes Gill Straker and Jacqui Winship in our column The modern mind, where experts discuss mental health issues they are seeing in their work. “In some ways PTSD puts us more in touch with life’s realities and strips us of the usual veils that we draw over these in order to protect ourselves. In a paradoxical manner, if the realities unmasked by trauma can be accepted and integrated, we can be more authentically connected to life than we were before.” The Queensland-set crime drama Troppo is “addictive in an airport novel sort of way: steeped in formula but quite appealingly written, performed and directed,” writes Guardian Australia film critic Luke Buckmater. “The tropical Queensland location allows for some fun settings and scenarios – from wildlife interactions to a man whose version ‘of an apple a day’ is injecting himself with snake venom. You don’t get that in the CBD; at least not at your local chemist.” The chairman of the United Australia party, Clive Palmer, says he’ll spend more than $80m on his party’s campaign in the upcoming federal election, making it the most expensive campaign in Australian history. This has reignited calls to reform the huge amounts of money poured into political campaigns and advertising. In today’s Full Story, reporter Christopher Knaus talks to Laura Murphy-Oates about the influence of money in federal politics.

2/28/2022,"Russian forces encircled Kyiv on Sunday, the city’s mayor said, but attacks to the Ukrainian capital’s north-west and an attempted incursion into the eastern city of Kharkiv were both repelled. In the southern coastal regions the Russian military appeared to be gaining strength, and there were signs of a change in its tactics as missile strikes were deployed against fixed targets. The capital’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said the city had been encircled, though routes to the south appeared to remain free on Sunday. Russian forces are continuing to slowly bear down on the city, but were repelled in Bucha and Irpin, on the north-west outskirt, after what appears to have been a poorly coordinated attack by irregular forces. A string of videos emerged on social media showing the aftermath of the fighting, with images of multiple destroyed armoured vehicles and several dead soldiers. Irpin’s mayor said the town remained in Ukrainian hands on Sunday morning. Reports circulated that Chechen soldiers were among those killed. And this is the road between Bucha and Irpin.Part of my usual bike route in the Kyiv region.Today it is a Russian Death Valley. pic.twitter.com/qR79LZOcJM There have been several days of heavy fighting in the area since Russia staged an airborne landing of forces in the nearby Hostomel military airport. Three bridges in the area have been reportedly blown up by Ukrainian forces to slow down the Russian advance. There were no Russian troops in the capital itself, Klitschko said. He said that nine civilians, 18 fighters and 4 unidentified persons had been killed in the capital since the start of fighting on 24 February. A total of 106 had been injured, 46 of whom were civilians. Ukraine remained in control of Chernihiv, north-east of the Kyiv, but Russian mechanised forces bypassed the city as they headed south, according to British defence intelligence, which has been monitoring the conflict closely. Satellite images showed a large, 3.25-mile long deployment of forces in a convoy north-east of Ivankiv, moving in the direction of Kyiv approximately 40 miles away. The convoy contains fuel, logistics and armoured vehicles. Russian forces west of Sumy were still making progress westward, according to the military intelligence group Rochan Consulting, and were believed to be about 150km east of Kyiv on Saturday night and likely to advance further on Sunday. There were also signs of a switch in tactics, with Russia more actively targeting fixed infrastructure with missile attacks. An oil terminal was set ablaze in Vasylkiv, nearly 40km south-west of Kyiv. The blast sent huge flames and billowing black smoke into the night sky. Russian Iskander ballistic missiles were fired from Belarus at around 5pm, Ukraine’s interior ministry said. Earlier in the day, the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, confirmed that more missiles had been fired from the country, as he hinted that Belarus’s own forces would join the war on the Russian side. An incursion by Russian forces into the eastern city of Kharkiv on Sunday was defeated, the Ukrainians said, by lunchtime, a verdict largely confirmed by reporters on the ground. The attack, by Russian Spetsnaz special forces, appeared not particularly determined, with social media images showing the invaders only using trucks and lightly armoured vehicles rather than battle tanks. The city’s governor, Oleh Synyehubov, said that Russian troops were giving themselves up, and images appeared on social media apparently showing captured Russian troops. Dozens had surrendered, city authorities said, suggesting a low degree of organisation and morale on the Russian side. The Russian military continued to make progress in the south, aided by its naval superiority in the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea. Ukrainian defence sources said that Russian forces captured part of Kherson, the city at the mouth of the Dnieper River. Russia’s defence ministry said it had blockaded Kherson and also Berdyansk, on the Sea of Azov. Video emerged of a Russian Buk missile system – the type that shot down Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 in 2014 – which was geolocated to Berdyansk. Russia also said it had taken control of an airbase between Kherson and Henichesk, a city on the Sea of Azov. Although Mariupol, close to the Russian border, remained in Ukrainian hands, Russia is believed to have created a land corridor that connects the nearby self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk to the Crimea by going around the city. Russian forces were also reported to have reached on the eastern side of the Dnieper River. Turkey also said the fighting in Ukraine amounted to a war, and said it would implement the Montreux convention, allowing it to close access to the Black Sea to Russian warships, although an exemption applies to ships returning to base. Ukraine still appears able to conduct limited air operations, much to the surprise of western military analysts who had expected a determined and far larger Russian air force to have destroyed Ukrainian planes almost immediately when fighting began. A video circulated on Sunday morning of a Turkish TB2 drone, no match for a fully deployed Russian air force, purportedly attacking a Russian military column. Analysts said it appeared to be genuine, and the video was posted by Ukraine’s military as a propaganda statement. Ukraine’s health ministry said that at least 198 Ukrainians, including three children, had been killed in the invasion. Ukraine’s defence ministry said that 4,300 Russian soldiers had been killed or wounded and that 27 planes, 26 helicopters and 146 tanks had been lost – but none of these figures could be verified. Russia has not released casualty figures.",News/World news,"Kyiv surrounded, says mayor: fighting on fourth day of Russian invasion",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/kyiv-surrounded-says-mayor-fighting-on-fourth-day-of-russian-invasion-of-ukraine

2/28/2022,"Oh no, what? An hour of Stanley Tucci? Just him, the lean-muscled bundle of talent and charisma, taking us round Italy at a leisurely pace, talking lovingly about the food and culture of the land of his forefathers? What did we do to suffer so? Help! Save us from this purgatory! I jest, of course. There is nothing purgatorial about Stanley Tucci: Searching for Italy (BBC Two). Not for the viewer, and certainly not for Tucci. In the opening episode, he gets to wander round Campania (other sunkissed regions are strolled through in later instalments), taking in the bustling delights of Naples, the serenity of the wooded mountains of the island of Ischia, the sea air of the Amalfi coast, the smell of the lemon groves and the taste of the limoncello of Minori. You could easily hate him – if he weren’t Stanley Tucci. But he is, and he is charming. And – you might have to prepare for this and possibly avail yourself of a contraceptive if you do not want to risk becoming pregnant through the screen – he speaks Italian. Maybe those who have seen the cocktail-making videos he put up on Instagram during lockdown or read his recent memoir Taste were already aware, but I was not and I now have two little bald twins in black polo necks whom I love very much. In Naples, birthplace of the pizza, we get a short, sweet history of the food and the city – the one growing out of the other’s poverty and bad sanitation. Frying bread was the hygienic choice in a city where cholera outbreaks were so common they gave rise to the saying among travellers “See Naples and die”. Adding things to that bread – tomato! Cheese, of course! Some basil, some pepper! – made it tasty, too. Locals had time to hone their delicacy to perfection before the real and assumed risks of visiting the place lessened enough in the late 19th century to allow it to become a place on the travellers’ trail. From then, pizza began its rightful world takeover. He runs the pizza gamut. Fernanda, a senora d’un certain age (yes, you infer correctly – my command of European languages was one of the main reasons I voted Remain), cooks him one of the original street versions that her family have been making for over a century (pork fat is one of the toppings). Tucci then travels with Enzo Coccia, the first pizzaiolo ever to be awarded a Michelin star, to gather San Marzano tomatoes direct from the field, mozzarella near-as-dammit straight from the buffalo, and watch him turn water, flour, yeast and salt into the perfect dough and – scattered with toppings and given just 45 seconds in the oven – the perfect pizza. “It’s a gift to humanity!” he cries. “And where was it born? Napoli!” All pizzaiolos, it seems, have a robust confidence in their product. Although, to be fair, noted pastry chef and inventor of the delizia al limone pudding (“This is the expression of the Amalfi coast!”) Sal De Riso gives them a good run for their money. “Have I proved to you this is the best pastry in the world,” he says as Tucci swallows his first bite of the heavenly looking mass of sponge and creams. I don’t put a question mark because it is not a question. Food is deftly used to illuminate place and vice versa wherever we go. The people of Ischia specialise in rabbit rather than seafood because their island shores were historically the haunt of pirates and foreign armies. Inhabitants took to the mountains and hunted the game in their forests. Scampia was a failed experiment (was there any other kind?) in social utopia in the 1960s, where people were moved in from the slums but without sufficient infrastructure, so the local mafia soon took over. It is now finding a small new lease of life through an activist/volunteer project that has burgeoned into a successful restaurant. It offers fusion Romany-Italian cooking, growing out of the former’s community that has gathered in the ghettoised place over the last decade or so. Tucci is an utterly inoffensive guide throughout this sweet, light delizia of a documentary, but there is one moment with Coccia that nicely illustrates his one weakness – which is that he is slightly too muted, too self-effacing. Coccia takes him ebulliently to task over his unexuberant appreciation of the pizza and Naples in all their glory. “Not ‘Napoli’!” he says, imitating Tucci’s neutral intonation. “NAApoli!” Tucci repeats it like an actor slipping into a character, and Coccia is even more gratified.

2/28/2022,"He has never fired a gun before but 27-year-old Tim Maxymenko says he sees no other option but to go back to his home country to fight. The Ukrainian-born artist is based in London and studied art at Wolverhampton University as part of the Erasmus programme. He is flying to the southern Polish city of Rzeszow on Monday and plans to travel to Ukraine later this week to join the resistance to the Russian invasion. When he was 18, Maxymenko took part in the 2014 revolution that ousted the previous pro-Russian government. “It is a very similar feeling to 2014. We have a lot of people who are ready to fight for freedom. Of course I’m scared, but I’m very angry and there are no other options. I can’t imagine life without doing this. “We can’t go to Moscow and stop Putin. But we can protect our land. And this land is the place of this fight for freedom.” Speaking to the Guardian he said: “I’ve never fired a gun, but I threw molotov cocktails in the revolution. If you cross the border into Ukraine you can go to a military office, then you can sign up for the territorial defence agency.” He added: “For the first few days we will transport helmets and jackets for soldiers to the border. I want to do whatever is most helpful at the moment. I feel more energetic that we can do something. I have that fight inside of me – emotionally I want to go to do something.” Maxymenko says he is “no fan” of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy but says he is doing the right thing by resisting Russia’s invasion. “I’m happy he is making these videos,” he said. Maxymento welcomed comments by the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, who said on Sunday the UK would support those travelling to fight in Ukraine. “I love this feeling of togetherness. The UK government is one of the more helpful governments in its understanding of the situation,” he said. Truss’s comments have been criticised as irresponsible, with former attorney general Dominic Grieve warning that it would be illegal for Brits to head to the Ukraine to fight. Harry Jackson, 27, from Bedford is the founder of a UK Aid for Ukraine, a Facebook group dedicated to supplying military and medical aid for Ukraine. Jackson says he has been inundated with messages from UK citizens wanting to know about volunteering to fight in Ukraine. He said: “I’ve been in contact with probably about 20 or 30 Brits just in the last two days who are messaging me saying me and saying, ‘I want to fight: who do I need to speak to, where do I need to go?’” “I’m putting them in touch with Mamuka Mamulashvili, commander of the Georgia foreign fighters legion.” Jackson shared some of the messages from would-be British volunteers. One said: “I’m serious about going, but I’m in two minds as it’s probably a one-way trip.” On Saturday Jackson, who works for a sustainability company in Cambridge, sent a van load of supplies that included 57 military helmets, 10 flak jackets and 600 field dressings, to the Ukrainian club in London. He says it was was picked up from his home in Bedford by four men on their way to fight in Ukraine. He added: “A lot medics have offered help, including one guy who is taking a field ambulance to Ukraine. And two or three lorry drivers offered to help to get stuff to Ukraine.” Jackson, who is married to a Pole who has an aunt based in Ukraine, said: “How can you just sit back and watch?”",News/World news,‘I want to fight’: Ukrainian in Britain plans to join defence of his homeland,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/i-want-to-fight-ukrainian-in-britain-plans-to-join-defence-of-his-homeland

Dyfed-Powys police in south Wales said on Sunday they were becoming increasingly concerned for the woman, whom they named as Rita, but did not give her surname. Rita was last seen at 10.20am on Saturday and may be wearing a fleece jumper with a leaf design, police said. She is thought to have been travelling on foot. A photograph was also released by the force, who said: “Have you seen Rita, or do you have information that might help us find her?” Rita is missing from where she lives in Brecon, a picturesque and historic market town on the edge of the Brecon Beacons. Police said local residents would see an increased police presence in Brecon as inquires continued. Searches were also being conducted by Brecon mountain rescue, Mid and West Wales fire service and the National Police Air Service. The Brecon & Radnor Express reported that dozens of local residents had taken to the streets to help in the search for Rita. Some posted on social media to encourage people in Brecon to search any accessible areas of their property such as gardens, greenhouses, garages and sheds. Fay Jones, the Conservative MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, appealed on Twitter: “Please everyone – eyes peeled. Rita’s family and friends are desperately worried. It’s been reassuring to hear helicopters over Brecon all day but Rita needs to be found ASAP.

2/28/2022,"Thousands of people gathered in cities across the UK for at times highly emotional rallies in support of Ukraine as the country defends itself against the brutal Russian invasion. In London, Trafalgar Square was a sea of blue and yellow as protesters voiced anguish and despair at Russian president Vladimir Putin’s bombardment of the eastern European country. Similar events were held across Britain, with demonstrations of various sizes taking place in Newcastle, Brighton, Exeter, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Nottingham, Cambridge, Oxford, Norwich and the Mumbles, near Swansea. Protests were also held in cities across the world. Police in Berlin estimated that at least 100,000 people gathered to show their solidarity with the people of Ukraine, while Prague drew 70,000. Large gatherings were also held in cities from Bangkok and Madrid to Paris and Amsterdam. In central London, thousands of Ukrainians waved their national flag, displayed anti-Putin placards and chanted slogans including ‘stop Putin, stop the war’ and ‘shelter our sky’, in reference to calls for a no-fly zone. One sign read ‘shelter our sky – we will take care of the rest’. Olena Marcyniuk, who lived in Ukraine until she was 14, attended the Trafalgar Square rally with her baby son William and made a desperate plea for Russians to take a stand against Putin. “I know you don’t want this,” she said, fighting back tears. “They have to come out on the street. Russians here, Russians in Russia, they have to come out. We don’t want to kill your boys and your fathers, we don’t want all of this. You have to stop him.” She added: “The freedom we got from independence, we thought it was forever. We thought finally, it is here to stay and we never expected this from Russia. “I’m so glad my grandparents are dead because this would have killed them on the spot.” Ekaterina, who did not want to give her last name, told the Guardian her family is split between living in Ukraine and Russia. She brought her dog Mabel along to the solidarity event and said her Ukrainian family is safe but “very scared” by the Russian invasion. “I don’t know anyone in Russia who supports this war,” she said. “I lived there my entire life, apart from these past three years, and none of my friends or relatives, people I went to university with or worked with, nobody supports this.” Alexandry Gosuliac, draped in a Ukrainian flag, said he speaks to his family back in Ukraine “every day” and expressed pride that his country’s army had “already shown the world what we can do”. “[My family] are trying to believe everything will be fine but we know everything will be fine,” he said. “We just need support in the air and we can do everything else, please. It is very important.” Snezhana and Alex, who did not want to give their last names, live in the UK but are originally from Belarus. They said they fear Putin will continue his military campaign beyond Ukraine and into other European countries. Snezhana, whose extended family still lives in Belarus, said: “We are sickened, overwhelmed and extremely frustrated with the whole situation and, as Belarusians who have been suffering for a very long time … when we heard about the attacks, we were absolutely shocked and felt we need to do something. “We have been supporting the army and trying to donate. Also, supporting our friends and giving information. We are here to try to let the world know what’s happening.” In Newcastle, 47-year-old Marek Bidwell, an environmental consultant, decided to stand in solidarity with Ukraine. He said he is a quarter Polish and his grandfather escaped from a Nazi prisoner of war camp, adding: “When I was young I have memories of us sending food parcels to my relatives in Poland because they were so poor. They were badly treated by the Russians who occupied Poland so I do feel solidarity with Ukrainians.” Like many, he watches the news in disbelief. “On Thursday I was in tears. I wasn’t expecting it. I wasn’t expecting that family history to bring me so much emotional angst but it did,” he said. Edinburgh West MP Christine Jardine was among those taking part in a protest in the Scottish capital – which is twinned with Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, where some of the fiercest attacks have been. She said: “All over Europe people are sending the clearest of messages to the Russian government, to Putin, to say this is not acceptable.”",News/World news,Thousands gather in cities across the UK in support of Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/thousands-gather-in-cities-across-the-uk-in-support-of-ukraine
2/28/2022,"The EU has announced it will ban the Russian state-backed channels RT and Sputnik in an unprecedented move against the Kremlin media machine. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, said: “Russia Today and Sputnik, as well as their subsidiaries, will no longer be able to spread their lies to justify Putin’s war and to sow division in our union. So we are developing tools to ban their toxic and harmful disinformation in Europe.” The move, which was not trailed or widely discussed, came as part of a package of tougher sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s government and the regime of the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, which Von der Leyen described as “complicit in this vicious attack against Ukraine”. European foreign policy taboos have been smashed in just a few days, after Russia invaded its neighbour, provoking fears of the biggest war in Europe since 1945. For the first time in its history, the EU will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons to a country under attack, Von der Leyen said. EU foreign ministers are expected to approve the use of funds from the European Peace Facility to finance lethal and non-lethal aid to Ukraine at a meeting on Sunday evening. While a handful of countries may hold back, because of policies against sending weapons into a conflict zone, the plan is expected to pass. Ministers are also set to agree to ban Russian airlines from EU skies, after more than a dozen countries took the decision unilaterally. “Our airspace will be closed to every Russian plane – and that includes the private jets of oligarchs,” Von der Leyen said. In a historic announcement to parliament, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said a fund of €100bn (£85bn) would be set up immediately to boost the strength of the country’s armed forces, as he also announced a sustained increase in defence spending over the coming years. Scholz admitted that the urgency of the Ukraine crisis had forced Germany’s decision to invest in the military, telling the emergency session of the Bundestag: “It is clear that we must invest significantly more in the security of our country, in order to protect our freedom and democracy.” He called it “Germany’s historical responsibility” to ensure that Vladimir Putin “does not turn the clocks back”. Long-term defence spending was to be increased year on year by more than 2% of GDP, he said. It is currently about 1.5% with Germany having been under growing pressure from its Nato allies, in particular the US, to increase the amount for years. The existence of the special fund should be anchored in Germany’s constitution, Scholz said, in order to ensure it remained a guarantee beyond the life of the current parliament. Germany has long been criticised by its allies for its resistance to increasing its defence spending. This position has been reinforced by a strong pacifist sentiment among the electorate linked to Germany’s Nazi past. In recent weeks, the country was also criticised for having not offered enough material support, in particular refusing to deliver lethal weapons to assist Ukraine to defend itself against Russia. The move came after the government made the surprise announcement on Saturday that it would be sending weapons and other supplies to Ukraine, including 1,000 anti-tank weapons, 500 surface-to-air Stinger missiles and thousands of gallons of petrol. The decision marks a historical break with Germany’s postwar pledge to not export weapons to conflict zones. A turning point came on Saturday evening with the government’s surprise announcement on weapons to Ukraine. It has also lifted certain restrictions on German-manufactured weapons being sent to conflict zones from third countries, such as Estonia and the Netherlands. The announcement to parliament was greeted with relief and surprise, with Scholz receiving a standing ovation on Sunday morning, even as some MPs, mainly from the the Left party as well as the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), groaned in disapproval. As expected the EU is also broadening economic sanctions against Belarus, imposed in 2020 after Lukashenko launched a brutal crackdown on peaceful protesters who contested his claimed election victory, seen as fraudulent by all independent observers. The Belarusian opposition has criticised the EU for loopholes in its sanctions regime that allowed Lukashenko to continue to benefit from export earnings. Von der Leyen insisted the new measures would “stop their exports of products from mineral fuels to tobacco, wood and timber, cement, iron and steel”. The EU’s promise to cut some Russian banks out of Swift, however, was not expected to be finalised on Sunday. The move against RT and Sputnik was the biggest surprise from the commission. The British culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, this week wrote to Ofcom asking it to look at whether RT should be allowed to broadcast “harmful disinformation” in the UK. Some argued against a ban, warning it could lead to Moscow closing down the BBC in Russia.",News/Media,EU to ban Russian state-backed channels RT and Sputnik,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/27/eu-ban-russian-state-backed-channels-rt-sputnik
2/28/2022,"It was a move from Thomas Tuchel that had worked before. In the European Super Cup final at the start of the season against Villarreal, the Chelsea manager had brought on Kepa Arrizabalaga for the penalty shootout. Arrizabalaga saved two and Chelsea won. The goalkeeper had been the hero of two shootout victories earlier in this edition of the Carabao Cup, saving once apiece against Aston Villa and Southampton. He had even made a crucial penalty save during extra-time in the FA Cup win over Plymouth at the start of this month. This time, it all went wrong for him and Tuchel. With nothing to separate Chelsea and Liverpool, a final that featured huge chances, dramatic saves, disallowed goals and VAR controversy hurtled into a shootout. On came Arrizabalaga for Édouard Mendy, who had been excellent, only for him to fail to get anywhere near to Liverpool’s five regulation kicks and the six in sudden death that followed. And then there he was, forced to take Chelsea’s 11th kick. He blazed it high over the bar and Liverpool had a victory to savour. For Jürgen Klopp, the third time was a charm at Wembley, after his losses here with Borussia Dortmund in the 2013 Champions League final to Bayern Munich and with Liverpool in the final of this competition to Manchester City in 2016 on penalties. Klopp could toast the assurance of his back-up goalkeeper, Caoimhin Kelleher, who scored his penalty in nerveless fashion – just before Arrizabalaga’s miss – and also made important saves during the game. It was Liverpool’s first domestic cup triumph since 2012 and, as they fight on all fronts, they will view it as a potential catalyst for greater triumphs before the end of the season. For Chelsea – and Arrizabalaga, especially – there were only regrets. The opening whistle had brought excitement and a narrowing of the focus but nobody could ignore the broader context; the horrors in Ukraine following the invasion by Russia. Tuchel admitted beforehand he had a “mixed feeling,” wondering whether the clubs would be “allowed to fully engage and fully celebrate” and there was no doubt that the unfolding situation at Chelsea regarding Roman Abramovich represented a distraction. Amid the threat of sanctions against him from the UK government, the Russian’s decision to look to cede control of the club to the trustees of Chelsea’s charitable foundation on Saturday night had driven a powerful plotline – with the potential to reshape the landscape at Stamford Bridge. The occasion had started with tears from Thiago on the Liverpool bench, the midfielder having been injured in the warm-up and replaced in the lineup by Naby Keïta, and the emotion crackled throughout an end-to-end thriller. Chelsea were quickly into their stride, hustling hard. With Romelu Lukaku still dropped, Kai Havertz brought trademark smoothness to the No 9 role, linking the play intelligently, and he had a hand in the build-up to the big early chance. From César Azpilicueta’s cross, Christian Pulisic had a first-time sidefoot only to put it too close to Kelleher. Klopp’s decision to persist with Kelleher ahead of Alisson had been well signposted; that of Tuchel to prefer Mendy to Arrizabalaga at the outset a little less so. That said, it was no real surprise. The club are ready to listen to offers for Arrizabalaga, who had started in every previous round of the tournament. The balance of the first-half was shifting when Mendy made a double save on the half hour. Sadio Mané had misdirected a presentable header from a Trent Alexander-Arrnold delivery and Liverpool were taking up advanced positions. Luis Díaz was relentless on the left – all silky movement and explosive bursts; what a game he had – and he and his teammates believed they could get at Trevoh Chalobah, Chelsea’s right-sided centre-half. It was Keïta that ran on to a lay-off and hammered in a low drive, which Mendy could only parry. But the goalkeeper sprang back up and was able to divert Mané’s close-range follow-up over the crossbar. Mane did little wrong. It was a breathtaking save from his Senegal teammate. Chelsea wanted to play off Havertz and punch hard on the counter. They flickered through Pulisic and Azpilicueta before half-time but it was Mason Mount that had Tuchel beating the turf in frustration on 45 minutes. Havertz crosssed from the right and, like Pulisic before him, Mount arrived in front of goal. His volley whistled past the near post. Worse would follow from Mount at the start of the second half. After Havertz had almost crossed for Pulisic, it was Pulisic that got Mount clean through with a chipped pass. Around the sides or through the middle, Chelsea came to believe they could open up Liverpool. Mount had only Kelleher to beat and the breakdown in Liverpool’s defensive structure was startling. Perhaps Mount had too much time. He jabbed in a low shot that hit the inside of the post and rolled to safety. This time, Tuchel got down on all four to smack the ground. Liverpool’s response was forceful; they blasted back into control and they thought they had the breakthrough moments after Salah had blown a one-on-one with Mendy, after a loose clearance by the goalkeeper and a quick Mané release. Alexander-Arnold hung up a free-kick towards Mané at the far post and, when he headed down and across, Joël Matip nodded home. Enter VAR, the technology spotting that Virgil van Dijk had been offside and interfering with the substitute Reece James when the free-kick was taken. It was extremely harsh, Van Dijk simply stood his ground. It was fast and furious, both teams determined to win it in normal time, and it was Liverpool who almost did. Díaz twice worked Mendy – on the second occasion, the goalkeeper’s save was superb – and, in stoppage-time, Mendy again excelled to keep out a Van Dijk header. For Chelsea, Havertz had the ball in the net only for Timo Werner, who had come off the bench, to have strayed offside before crossing while Lukaku – on in the 73rd minute – touched a Marcos Alonso cross at the near post and saw Kelleher save smartly. Lukaku would come closer in extra time, bursting on to a Chalobah pass, jinking inside and ramming low past Kelleher only to be ruled marginally offside while Havertz would have the ball into the net again only to see yet another flag.",Sport/Football,Liverpool win Carabao Cup final after beating Chelsea in penalty shootout,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/27/chelsea-liverpool-carabao-cup-final-match-report
2/28/2022,"Russian billionaires Mikhail Fridman and Oleg Deripaska have become two of the country’s first leading businesspeople to speak out against Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Fridman, who is one of Russia’s richest men, controls private equity firm LetterOne and was a founder of Alfa Bank, Russia’s largest private bank. In a letter to his employees he called for an end to the “bloodshed”. Ukrainian-born Fridman sent an email to staff at LetterOne, first reported by the Financial Times, in which he wrote “war can never be the answer”. Describing his Ukrainian roots in Lviv, where his parents still live, he wrote: “I have also spent much of my life as a citizen of Russia, building and growing businesses. I am deeply attached to Ukrainian and Russian peoples and see the current conflict as a tragedy for them both.” Another Russian billionaire, Oleg Deripaska, called for peace talks to begin “as fast as possible” in a post on the messaging app Telegram. “Peace is very important,” wrote Deripaska, who founded Russian aluminium giant Rusal, in which he still owns a stake through shares in its London-listed parent company EN+ Group. Deripaska, who said as recently as 21 February there would not be a war in Ukraine, has been on the US sanctions list since 2018 over his alleged links to the Russian government, which he has taken legal action to challenge. Fridman was ranked as the 128th richest person in the world in 2021, according to the publication Forbes’ world billionaire list. The 57-year-old told staff in his letter that he usually avoids making political statements. “I am a businessman with responsibilities to my many thousands of employees in Russia and Ukraine. I am convinced however that war can never be the answer. This crisis will cost lives and damage two nations who have been brothers for hundreds of years,” he wrote. “While a solution seems frighteningly far off, I can only join those whose fervent desire is for the bloodshed to end.” Fridman’s LetterOne owns assets in its L1 Retail unit including the UK health food retailer Holland & Barrett, as well as Spain’s supermarket chain DIA, as well as mobile phone service provider Turkcell, which has customers in Turkey, Ukraine, Belarus and Cyprus. Fridman and Deripaska join a small group of prominent Russians – including popular actors, musicians and television presenters – who have called on President Vladimir Putin stop the military operation in Ukraine, although many Russian oligarchs have remained silent. Intervention may begin to put pressure on Moscow’s elite from the worlds of business and finance to voice their opposition to Putin’s invasion. The country’s wealthiest people are expected to face significant economic upheaval as sanctions against Russia mount, including the expulsion of several Russian banks from the Swift global banking payments system, designed to disconnect the country from international finance.",News/World news,Two top Russian billionaires speak out against invasion of Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/two-top-russian-billionaires-speak-out-against-invasion-of-ukraine
2/28/2022,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has so far been curiously uncoordinated, even haphazard, in its first four days – prompting fears that Kremlin may adopt more brutal and deadly methods to achieve victory at a higher cost. Military analysts have been surprised by what they see as repeated errors, perhaps reflecting Russian president Vladimir Putin’s mistaken belief that Ukrainians had an underlying affinity with Russia and would simply acquiesce in the fall of Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskiy once Moscow’s troops rolled in. One expert, Professor Lawrence Freedman, posted on the topic in Sunday. “The first great surprise of this war,” he wrote “lies in the failure of the Russian higher command to take advantage of their protracted military build-up to design and then implement an effective offensive.” Early mistakes have included Russia’s dramatic helicopter landing of airborne forces at Hostomel military airport just north-west of Kyiv, far ahead of the prevailing invasion and without any meaningful air support. Four days of fighting in the area ensued, with Ukraine able to drive out Russian forces from the nearby Buch and Irpin towns just out the side the capital. A similarly half-hearted attack took place on Sunday in the eastern city of Kharkiv, where there was an incursion of Russian spetsnaz commandos using who, judging by the video reports, only used trucks and light armoured vehicles rather than tanks. It was beaten back by lunchtime, suggesting it was not a serious attempt at conquest. Equally baffling to western observers has been Russia’s limited use of air power. It had been assumed that Moscow would aim to knock out Ukraine’s jets and helicopters on day one and establish air superiority. Justin Bronk, an air power analyst at the Rusi thinktank, said: “I am quite surprised and confused by the lack of publicly available activity by the bulk of Russia’s fixed-wing aircraft.” Although missile strikes on the first day are thought to have largely knocked out Ukraine’s long-range radar and its ageing S-300 air defence systems, a portion of its airforce has remained active, perhaps 20 Mig-29s and a dozen Su-27 fast jets on Bronk’s estimate, flying low to avoid detection. Even some of its dozen or so Turkish TB2 drones appear to remain, which should be easy prey for a nearby air defence system. A video, widely circulated by the Ukrainian military and considered by analysts to be genuine, showed what appeared to be a strike on a Russian convoy. Such reverses have lifted Ukrainian morale. The country is now experiencing an extraordinary national mobilisation where people, mostly men, have queued to join up and others begun to make Molotov cocktails to prepare for what may yet be fierce battles for control of the great cities. Even if Zelenskiy were to be captured or killed in a missile strike, the nation appears ready to fight on. But these are also simply the opening salvos of a war. For all the Russian missteps so far, Moscow’s larger forces have made steady progress elsewhere, sidestepping resistance where possible. Its principal invasion forces have headed to Kyiv, and on Sunday night, the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said in an interview, “Right now we are encircled” although this was still be confirmed. Russian forces also appear to be gradually cutting off the south, east of Kherson, on the mouth of the Dnieper, with only an increasingly isolated Mariupol holding out. In other words, the Russian mistakes may have only obscured the underlying strength of its overall position. Western nations have rushed to offer to send more weapons to Ukraine, notably Germany, which has ended its postwar hesitance over arms exports and offered to send 1,000 anti-tank weapons and 500 ground-to-air Stinger missiles. The question now will be whether they can get the supplies there by land, as Russia controls more key points of territory. Western analysts have been predicting that Russia would try to encircle Kyiv, a city of around 3 million people, for weeks – and try to use the FSB spy agency to deliver the city through a coup. So far, however, there has been little sign of a determined fifth column in the country, and it may well be the case that Putin will seek to take Kyiv by force. The anxiety is that Putin may resort to urban warfare – grim combat where an attacker is considered to need an advantage of five to one to prevail. It is not clear how organised Kyiv’s defences are, given Zelenskiy’s last-minute mobilisation last week, but one way Russia could force a victory is to use weaponry indiscriminately, particularly if Putin is determined to gain a quick win in order to save face.",News/World news,"Russian strategic slips lift Ukrainian morale, but should not obscure broader picture",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/russian-strategic-slips-ukrainian-morale-early-days
2/28/2022,"Governments must start treating the climate crisis as a national security concern, on a par with war and peace, as climate breakdown threatens countries’ stability and safety, the global chief of the Red Cross has warned. Jagan Chapagain, secretary general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said: “People should be seeing the climate as a national security issue, as it is having an impact on national security. We need to see that the climate crisis is not only having an environmental impact, but a very significant security impact.” Chapagain was speaking before the publication of a scientific report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on Monday, which is expected to show that the impacts of the climate crisis are greater than feared, and that governments must act rapidly to prepare for extreme weather and its consequences. The Red Cross has warned that at least 1.7 billion people already face serious problems, including food and water shortages, arising from or made worse by the climate crisis. Before the outbreak of Covid-19, the organisation – which works in conflict zones and with those affected by disasters – found that 2 million people a week needed humanitarian assistance owing to the impacts of climate breakdown. Chapagain said: “Every inhabited part of the world is affected. Through our work in responding to disasters, we can see this is clearly having an effect – you can see it now, with the naked eye, that this is happening. Unfortunately, I don’t think we are as prepared as we should be.” More people are facing hunger, water shortages and the prospect of having to move to avoid natural disasters such as floods, droughts and extreme temperatures, he said. “There are impacts on displacement: we did a study last year that found more displacement from the climate than from conflict,” he said, in an interview with the Guardian. Most of that displacement is currently happening within country borders, but that can still have an impact on national security and the potential for conflict, he added. Governments are not used to thinking of the climate in terms of national security, said Chapagain. National security concerns are obvious in conflicts such as Ukraine, but he said that the problems of the climate crisis were unfolding in ways not yet widely acknowledged. “We must take a holistic view. The climate crisis affects national security, and this must take much greater priority for governments than it has done,” he added. “If we respond in a piecemeal fashion, we will underestimate the enormity of the climate crisis.” All government departments must be included in the response to climate breakdown, Chapagain said. “There is a complete disconnect at the moment,” he added. The IPCC, the body of the world’s leading climate scientists, will publish its report on Monday on the impacts of the climate crisis, covering which areas are most vulnerable, and advising on how countries must adapt to the impacts of extreme weather that are now inevitable even if the world succeeds in limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. This is the second of four parts of its “sixth assessment report”, the latest in a series of comprehensive summaries of the world’s knowledge of the climate, stretching back to 1988. The first part was published last August, while a third part, to be published in April, will set out the means of dealing with the crisis, such as investing in renewable energy and novel technologies such as carbon capture. As IPCC reports take between five and seven years to compile, the current assessment is likely to be the last while there is still time to stave off the worst ravages of climate breakdown. Global greenhouse gas emissions must halve by 2030, to stay within 1.5C, the IPCC has previously warned, but after the plunge caused by the lockdowns global carbon dioxide emissions have bounced back and are set to rise strongly again this year.",News/Environment,"Climate emergency a ‘national security’ concern, says Red Cross",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/27/climate-emergency-a-national-security-concern-says-red-cross
