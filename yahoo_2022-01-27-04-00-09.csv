1/27/2022,"A Russian YouTuber is living out a ""Star Wars"" dream after creating the world's first retractable lightsaber. Alex Burkan, behind the YouTube channel Alex Lab, was recognized by Guinness World Records for the over 3 foot plasma blade that reaches temperatures over 5,072 degrees Fahrenheit and can cut through steel, according to a news release. Burkan told Guinness his main field of research was in hydrogen generation equipment and creating the saber was a daunting task. ""All my life I was a great 'Star Wars' fan and the lightsaber was my most-wanted gadget,"" he said. ""For many years I have collected ideas and spare parts for my lightsaber and power equipment on the internet markets and [from] scrap yards."" The first step was building an electrolyser – a device that creates a large amount of hydrogen and oxygen gases and splits them, Burkan told Guinness.

""It works for only 30 seconds on full power, the hydrogen torch is not as stable as it could be and you can easily see it when it moves. Sometimes the lightsaber just blows up in your hand because of hydrogen flashback,"" he told Guinness. He plans to continue working on his lightsaber and get it ""close to the movie version."" And if the iconic ""Star Wars"" weapon doesn't interest you, he is also working on an Iron Man suit. ""Of course it’s a great feeling to get into Guinness World Records with something that you just made with your own hands,"" Burkan said. ""The only wish now to make something more epic!""

1/27/2022,"The moment a Georgia deputy was shot in the chest was recorded by his body camera, and it shows the motorist disguised the weapon by wrapping it in a towel. Deputy John Kile of the Jones County Sheriff’s Office was hospitalized and survived the Jan. 23 shooting, due to his bullet proof vest, the department said in a Facebook post. The graphic 10-minute video just released by officials starts with Kile pulling over driver Zachary Lucas Olivar, 24, on a dark two-lane highway between the Wayside and Round Oak communities. The area is about 18 miles north of Macon. Olivar puts his hands out of the driver’s side window, as if surrendering. However, he refuses repeated requests to exit the car. “This is my home, sir. This is my home,” Olivar says repeatedly. It’s around the 4-minute mark that something appears in Olivar’s hand, prompting the deputy to ask: “What you got?” Seconds later, a gun wrapped in a towel is thrust out the window and a flash point is seen. Kile grunts from the impact of a bullet, but doesn’t fall. Instead, the camera shows his feet running to his patrol car, as he screams “Shots fired, shots fired” into his radio. Video recorded from the perspective of the patrol car shows Kile was standing just a few feet from the gun, and he is seen grabbing his chest as he runs back to his vehicle. The video concludes with Olivar captured six minutes later, after his vehicle is forced off the road. Kile was among the pursuing officers, despite his injuries, officials said. Olivar, who lives in Snellville, is being held without bond at the Jones County Sheriff’s Office “facing aggravated assault charges,” officials said. Jones County Sheriff R.N. “Butch” Reece says investigators have learned Olivar has a “history of mental illness,” which is why he decided to release the video. “We have received reports that he has been having issues for the past week, with several attempts made by his family to get him help,” Reece wrote on Facebook. “Families are struggling to get help for loved ones with mental health issues; however, it seems all too often that these individuals fall through the cracks. Unfortunately it sometimes takes an incident like this one to show how important accessibility to mental health care really is. Our jails are not designed to be mental health treatment facilities.” Reece concluded his post by saying he hopes the incident helps bring “a much needed change in the mental health system” with the help of state legislative action.

1/27/2022,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy said on Tuesday it was making arrangements to recover an F-35C warplane that fell into the South China Sea after a landing mishap this week. Seven U.S. military personnel were hurt in Monday's accident on the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson and the pilot ejected, the Navy said. ""I can confirm the aircraft impacted the flight deck during landing and subsequently fell to the water,"" said Lieutenant Nicholas Lingo, spokesperson for the U.S. 7th Fleet. ""The U.S. Navy is making recovery operations arrangements for the F-35C aircraft."" Asked about an unsourced media report suggesting there were fears that the aircraft could fall into the hands of China, which claims most of the South China Sea, Lingo replied, referring to the People's Republic of China: ""We cannot speculate on what the PRC's intentions are on this matter."" It was the second crash involving an F-35, which is made by Lockheed Martin, and a carrier in just over two months. An F-35 from Britain's HMS Queen Elizabeth crashed into the Mediterranean Sea in November, though the pilot ejected and was safely returned to the ship. Britain's Ministry of Defence said that aircraft was subsequently recovered. Earlier this month, a South Korean F-35A fighter made an emergency landing during training. In April 2019, a Japanese F-35 stealth fighter crashed in the Pacific Ocean close to northern Japan, killing the pilot. The U.S. Navy said the pilot ejected safely in Monday's incident, but was among the personnel hurt. The Pentagon says two Carrier Strike Groups, ledby the Carl Vinson and USS Abraham Lincoln, began operations inthe South China Sea on Sunday. They entered the disputed sea for training as Taiwan reported a new Chinese air force incursion at the top of the waterway. Lockheed Martin, which makes F-35 jets, reported better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday.
