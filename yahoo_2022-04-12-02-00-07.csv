4/12/2022,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — A state court judge has concluded that Democrat Abby Finkenauer cannot appear on the June 7 primary ballot for U.S. Senate, knocking off the candidate considered by many to be the party's best chance to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley. Judge Scott Beattie, a 2018 appointee of Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds, filed a ruling late Sunday that overturned a decision by a three-member panel of state elected officials. The panel concluded last week that Finkenauer's campaign staffers had substantially complied with Iowa law that requires candidates to obtain 3,500 names, including at least 100 signatures from at least 19 counties. Two Republicans challenged Finkenauer's petition papers, saying signatures from at least two counties did not have the required date accompanying them. In the past, the panel, which includes the secretary of state, attorney general and state auditor, has found petitions to be in substantial compliance with the law even though signatures were missing or difficult to interpret. Attorney General Tom Miller and Auditor Rob Sand, both Democrats, voted to allow Finkenauer's petitions citing past precedent for giving deference to campaigns that used the proper forms and made efforts to comply with the law. Secretary of State Paul Pate, a Republican, voted against Finkenauer's petition. Kim Schmett and Leanne Pellett, former Republican county elections officials, challenged the signatures and then filed a court appeal of the Iowa Objection Panel's decision last week. Beattie concluded that the panel's legal interpretation was wrong and that the law clearly says each signature should be accompanied by a date. His decision knocked signatures from Allamakee and Cedar counties off of Finkenauer's nomination petitions, which meant her campaign failed to submit at least 100 signatures from at least 19 counties as required. Beattie said he took no joy in the decision. “This court should not be in the position to make a difference in an election, and Ms. Finkenauer and her supporters should have a chance to advance her candidacy. However, this court’s job is to sit as a referee and apply the law without passion or prejudice. It is required to rule without consideration of the politics of the day. Here the court has attempted to fulfill that role,” he said, Finkenauer accused Beattie of doing the bidding of Grassley and his allies in Washington. “This misguided, midnight ruling is an outrageous and partisan gift to the Washington Republicans who orchestrated this meritless legal action,"" she said. “We are exploring all of our options to fight back hard against this meritless partisan attack, and to ensure that the voices of Iowans will be heard at the ballot box."" Finkenauer said her petitions had more than 5,000 signatures and she’s confident she has met the requirements to be on the ballot. Beattie promised last week he would file a decision by midnight Sunday to give either side time to appeal to the Iowa Supreme Court. He filed the decision at 10:49 p.m. Sunday. Pate has said he must know whether Finkenauer qualifies for the ballot by Friday to give him time to have ballots printed and sent to overseas voters who must get their ballots by April 23 to comply with the law. Finkenauer, who served one term in the U.S. House from 2019-2021, seeks to be on the ballot with Democrats Mike Franken, a retired Navy admiral, and Glenn Hurst, a doctor and Minden City Council member. The primary winner will face Grassley, who is seeking an eighth term in the Senate. Federal fundraising data and statewide polling indicate that Grassley, who turns 89 in September, is well positioned to retain the seat he has held since 1981 for another six years. Grassley has raised more than $4.7 million, Finkenauer about $1.9 million and Franken $1.8 million. Hurst raised just over $66,000. Republican state Sen. Jim Carlin, who will be on the Republican primary ballot opposite Grassley, raised $282,151. The Des Moines Register/Medicom Poll published in November gave Grassley a lead of 18 percentage points over Finkenauer. Alan R. Ostergren, the attorney for Schmett and Pellett, said the judge's decision is a victory for the rule of law. “Iowans expect candidates to follow state law and to follow the same rules as the hundreds of other candidates who successfully qualified to be on the ballot,"" he said in a statement. ""Anyone who has ever been involved in a political campaign knows that you can easily avoid problems by turning in more than the bare minimum number of signatures. Abby Finkenauer didn’t do this for some reason and got caught short.”",U.S./Associated Press,Leading Iowa Democrat knocked off US Senate primary ballot,https://news.yahoo.com/leading-iowa-democrat-knocked-off-153550871.html
4/12/2022,"The hosts of “The View” were pretty split Monday on whether Will Smith’s punishment from the Academy was enough. But for Joy Behar, it was nothing to write home about. On Friday, it was announced that Smith has been barred from the Oscars for 10 years as a consequence of him slapping Chris Rock during the awards ceremony last month. “This action we are taking today in response to Will Smith’s behavior is a step toward a larger goal of protecting the safety of our performers and guests, and restoring trust in the Academy,” the Academy said in a statement. “We also hope this can begin a time of healing and restoration for all involved and impacted.” “Eh. So what?” Behar said flippantly. “Who wants to go to that anyway?” But posing the question to the rest of the group of whether the punishment fit the crime, Behar received mixed responses. Host Sara Haines said that it went a bit far. “I actually, when I heard 10, I thought that felt like a lot of time. You talk about someone having growth, and taking time to recognize he did something wrong, it felt like overkill in some ways,” Haines argued. “I thought maybe he’d be out for three to five years, or not be able to — now he won’t be able to — present next year, and all that felt appropriate. But when I heard a whole decade….” As Haines gave her input, Behar joked that 10 years of punishment is more time than Donald Trump will get for any of his actions. Contrary to Haines, host Sunny Hostin and guest host Alyssa Farah Griffin felt that a 10-year ban for Smith was appropriate, given the violent nature of what happened. “I actually thought it was appropriate. I think there are like a thousand responses short of physical violence that you could’ve defended your wife,” Griffin said. “Use your words, like we teach our kids that. It was just such a dark moment that took away from the art that we were celebrating.” Hostin agreed, noting that the punishment is “appropriate for what we saw,” but also took a moment to criticize those who blamed Smith’s actions on his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith. At the end of the segment, Behar went on to joke that Pinkett Smith should have slapped Rock herself.",U.S./The Wrap,‘The View’ Host Joy Behar Shrugs Off Will Smith’s Oscars Punishment: ‘Who Wants to Go to That Anyway?’,https://news.yahoo.com/view-host-joy-behar-shrugs-161437813.html
4/12/2022,"In his monthly newsletter, Arnold Schwarzenegger shares tips and insights on weight training based on his decades of experience as a seven-time Mr. Olympia champion. His advice can range from how he achieves mind muscle connection to how he has adapted his workouts to avoid injury as he has gotten older. Most recently, Schwarzenegger responded to a fan's question about his bench press technique, specifically relating to his grip: when he performs this move, his thumb is not wrapped around the bar. This is called the suicide grip, something which Men's Health generally does not advise—and the more you hear Arnold talk about it, you can understand why. ""I could give you a whole page of reasons why I did it, but this newsletter is all about being honest,"" he wrote. ""The reality is, there was no reason, and I mainly did it on the incline bench just because it felt good."" The purpose of the suicide grip is simple: You're taking a joint out of the equation. When you wrap your thumb around the bar, by default, the bar winds up sitting a bit higher in your palm. That means you have to find a good wrist position, and, in many cases, that's moving the bar further away from your forearm bone. It's one more thing you have to control when you're bench pressing. The suicide grip gets around that: Because you're not wrapping your thumb around the bar, it's easier to get the bar right above your forearm bones (ulna and radius), and that makes it easier to keep your forearm perpendicular to the ground, the ideal angle needed to generate force on the bench press. The problem is, this creates a lot of risk. Because your thumb isn't wrapped around the bar, you have that much less control over the bar, opening the door for it to slip from your grip and crash down onto your body. That's why we at Men's Health do NOT advise using the suicide grip, especially if you're new to the bench press. It's safest to learn how to grip the bar tightly, protecting yourself against injuries and other issues. Additionally, wrapping your thumb around a bar (or even dumbbells and kettlebells) offers other strengths beyond safety. Fully gripping the bar helps mitigate the risks of the bench press, and it also allows you to capitalize on the principle of irradiation: By creating maximum tension through your forearm muscles by gripping the bar, you're more easily able to activate stabilizing muscles throughout your shoulders, forearms, and midback. Arnold himself acknowledges the risk of injury that comes with this technique in his newsletter. ""It is called the suicide grip for a reason,"" he said. ""Only do this if you have a spotter with you, and make sure you have a real spotter, not someone looking at their Instagram while you unrack the weight.""
