4/1/2022,"The desert mule deer is a common sight in the Trans-Pecos region of west Texas, but when wildlife biologists conducted surveys recently, they came across an extremely uncommon sight. In fact, it was what they called “the rarest of rare” animals. What the Texas Parks and Wildlife—Trans-Pecos Wildlife District spotted from a helicopter and captured in video was a melanistic (black hair) mule deer fawn, “a one-in-a-million anomaly.” Also on FTW Outdoors: Rarely seen creature that eats porcupines captured in video “This special deer appears all black except for quick flashes of white fur as it dashes away from the whirring helicopter,” the Fort Worth Star-Telegram said. “It stands in stark contrast to the older, larger mule deer running ahead of it, sporting the typical brown and white coloration.” The video was posted on Facebook with credit to District 1 biologists J. Etchart and J. Weaver. 
“Melanism is a rare, random genetic anomaly believed to be caused by mutations in the melanicortin 1 receptor gene (MC1R), which leads to an over production of the pigment melanin,” the TPWD stated on Facebook. “It’s difficult for biologists to quantify the number of mule deer that have this condition, but it’s estimated to be around 1 in several million – making it even more rare than an albino (all white hair) or piebald (white spotted) mule deer. A one-in-a-million anomaly.” Photo courtesy of TPWD.  ",U.S./FTW Outdoors,‘Rarest of rare’ animal spotted in Texas desert,https://news.yahoo.com/rarest-rare-animal-spotted-texas-160239047.html
4/1/2022,"A Ukrainian military charity posted video it said showed Ukrainian destroying two tanks. One burst into flames after being hit by what the charity said was a mortar strike. Russia has lost a huge number of tanks in Ukraine as its invasion falters. A video shared by a Ukrainian military charity on Wednesday appeared to show Ukrainian forces blowing up a Russian armored vehicle in a column. The video was shared on Facebook by Come Back Alive, a Ukrainian non-profit raising funds for troops fighting in the conflict. The charity wrote that one strike, seemingly the first, was carried out by the Ukrainian 54th Separate Mechanized Brigade. ""It is nice to see how the equipment that the Come Back Alive team passes to the front units brings tangible results and helps our defenders to beat the Russian aggressor, to inflict tangible blows on him,"" the charity said. ""Recently, the foundation provided the K2 54 Mechanized Brigade soldiers with transport and drones, and the result is a direct hit on the tank on the move"" it said. The brigade reposted the video on its own page, writing ""Thanks for the help in the fight for victory!"" The group said the tank, part of an armored column, was hit by a mortar strike that was corrected for accuracy by a drone flying overhead. The Wall Street Journal has noted drones being used for this purpose in Ukraine. There was not a description that seemed to describe the method of the second attack. Neither incident was given a location or a date. Insider was also not able to independently verify the video. Videos emerging from Ukraine have showed dozens of tanks and other armored vehicles being destroyed. Insider reported on March 22 that Russia had lost a tenth of its total tank arsenal in Ukraine, leading some military experts to question their role in modern warfare. Come Back Alive, the charity that published the latest footage, was founded in 2014, around the time that Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine and began supported armed separatists in the eastern Donbas region. The charity said it uses the funds to provide Ukrainian troops with laptops, photo equipment, drones, and other technical equipment. It does not purchase any weapons, it said.

4/1/2022,"As the Russian invasion of Ukraine grinds into its sixth week, experts and Western intelligence agencies are continuing to sketch out potential endgames for the conflict. It’s possible that a ceasefire could emerge, and the Russian military, facing surprisingly fierce Ukrainian resistance, would simply back off its initial war aim of regime change in Kyiv and control over the country’s future. But recent history suggests the solution won’t be that simple. Russia could also exploit its far larger military might and continue its advance into Ukraine, particularly in the east, where it now appears to be focused. Although Russian President Vladimir Putin may continue to face heavy losses, the sheer size of his army sets up the possibility of the Kremlin occupying swaths of Ukrainian territory and facing a protracted and bloody insurgence. “Insurgency is different from regular warfare in that it's usually troops that are not in a formalized military structure,” Emily Harding, the deputy director and senior fellow of the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, explained to Yahoo News. An insurgence is most likely to happen, Harding believes, if Russian soldiers occupy a significant number of Ukrainian territories in the coming months or even years. But if the Ukrainian population maintains its defiance, supporting a militia effort and harassing Russian troops, Putin may not have enough forces to fully establish control there. “To me, that would be a really critical moment for the way this conflict goes, there's a numbers game to be played,” Harding said. “If you look at the required ratio [of troops] for occupying territory, it's a lot higher than you would think. And so the Russians, they just don't physically have enough Russian soldiers to try to hold much territory in Ukraine.” But in order to be successful, insurgent militias require both financial and military assistance — likely coming from both the local population and foreign governments opposed to the Russian invasion. (Similar, in fact, to how Moscow has supported an insurgence in Ukraine’s eastern region, furnishing the local armies with weapons and other support.) “In fact, that's critical to the success of most insurgencies that you have foreign assistance pouring in, both militarily and with people and money,” Harding said. For now, Russia is not facing a significant Ukrainian insurgence because its large military has failed to conquer significant Ukrainian territory since launching the invasion last month. Ukraine’s largest cities have thus far repelled Russian troops, whose most significant territorial gains have been in the country’s coastal south. “We saw the Russians not only meet heavy resistance from the Ukrainians, but we also saw the Russians have real trouble with their logistical tail,” Harding said. “They couldn't move as quickly as they wanted to through the roadways and through the railways of Ukraine. We joked a lot about how when we were studying the Russian cyber capabilities, we really should have been studying eastern Ukrainian mud.” But the war is far from over. “I think people underestimate the extent to which the Russian government is willing to just throw people at the problem,” she said. “They don't care so much about the health and well-being of their troops. I think people who are assuming that there is a big win to happen here in the near term are probably assuming too much.” _____",World/Yahoo News,Could the Russian invasion spark a Ukrainian insurgence?,https://news.yahoo.com/could-the-russian-invasion-spark-a-ukrainian-insurgence-162827838.html
